      <field name="fulltext">VOLUME I. TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES. SYMPATHY, A POEM. REVISED FROM THE SIXTH EDITION. TO THE AUTHOR OF SYMPATHY, A POEM. ON Scar's lov'd banks, a stream unknown to fame, That wildly winds this tangled dell along, Where oft I feel the Muse's hallow'd flame, And glow enraptur'd with her Attic song: And oft her awful, high-wrought strains recal, As o'er the stage in tragic robe she sweeps, With terror fraught the shuddering soul t'appal, Whilst Pity, soften'd with her sorrows, weeps For The River Avon, in Somersetshire. Avon's bard this chaplet let me twine, Culling one branch from her immortal wreath; For, tender bard, empassion'd heart is thine, And thoughts that warm from social feeling breath. Vivid and bright as thy ideas glow, Thy magic verse th' enlivening flame imparts; From thee to us the strong emotions flow, And, ere aware, we feel them in our hearts. E'en those who read but to amuse the hour, Catch from thy page sensations more refin'd; And, sweet Enthusiast, wonder at thy pow'r, Which so expands their souls to all mankind. Go then, in Virtue's cause the passions move, And self to gen'rous-glowing social raise: Be this thy meed, The good and wise approve, And BEATTIE's sanction ratifies the praise. R. POTTER The elegant Translator of Euripides and Ãschlus.. Scarning, 16th August, 1781. TO THE AUTHOR OF SYMPATHY By Miss Reeve To whom the public is indebted for the Old English Baron, and many other ingenious publications., WHAT son of PhÅbus strikes the heavenly lyre? With sweetest strains of Nature, and of art, What sounds that sacred harmony inspire, Strike on the ear, and vib'rate thro' the heart? While this new candidate for virtuous fame, Like a coy lover, hides the secret flame, Enjoys the plaudits, and conceals his name? Hear'st thou, my Clio?âHeav'n-descended Muse Let not this laurel'd Chief remain unknown; Tho' modest merit shou'd the praise refuse, Assert thy Poet, and his temples crown; O! should a lay like this be sung in vain? Or shou'd the sweetest swan conceal'd remain, While many a goose loud gabbles o'er the plain? Within each gen'rous heart, his song enshrin'd, Shall rouse the social passions to a tear; Shall wake to Sympathy each feeling mind, And blend Love's rosy smile with Pity's tear. Then, Clio, tell with pride thy Poet's name, Freed from the fears of Envy's dart or blame, And let th' admiring worldâthy Bard proclaim. SYMPATHY. BOOK I. O'er yon fair lawn, where oft in various talk The fav'ring Muses join'd our evening walk, Up yonder hill that rears its crest sublime, Where we were wont with gradual steps to climb, To hear the Lark her earliest matin sing, And woo the dew-bath'd zephyrs on the wing; Fast by yon shed, of roots and verdure made, Where we have paus'd, companions of the shade In yonder cot just seated on the brow, Whence, unobserv'd, we view'd the world below; Whence oft we cull'd fit objects for our song, From land or ocean widely stretch'd along; The morning vapours passing thro' the vale, The distant turret or the lessening sail, The pointed cliff which overhangs the main, The breezy upland, or the opening plain; The misty traveller yet dimly seen, And every hut which neighbours on the green, Or down yon foot-way saunter'd by the stream, Whose little rills ran tinkling to the theme, More softly touch'd the woe in Hammond's lay, Or laps'd responsive to the lyre of Gray; O'er these dear bounds like one forlorn I roam, O'er these dear bounds, I fondly call'd my home. And yet to touch me various powers combine Where summer revels with a warmth divine; The glowing season here each charm supplies, From earth's rich harvest crown'd with cloudless skies, Or future plenty bursting through the grain, From golden sheaves that circle round the swain. Here as I stop, beneath Eliza's tree, Far, oh belov'd associate! far from thee, Some little change thy absence to declare I pray to find, and friendship forms the pray'r: Less bright the sun-beams, or less soft the show'rs, Some essence wanting to the fruits or flow'rs: Those fruits and flow'rs, alas! more ripe appear, And the lawn smiles as tho' my friend were here; From the soft myrtle brighter blossoms spring, In mellower notes the plumy people sing: Near yonder church were we retir'd to pray, The good man's modest cottage I survey; Our pious Pastor, who each sabbath taught The listening rustic's noblest reach of thought: That modest cottage and its garden still Seek the soft shelter of the friendly hill; The column'd smoke still curls its wreathes around, And not one lessen'd beauty marks the bound. As near yon bow'r with pensive steps I go, To view the shrubs your culture taught to grow, The fair exotics boast a happier bloom Than when their patron shar'd the rich perfume: The orange still its tawny lustre shews, The late rose reddens, and the balsam blows; While roving o'er the hedge the woodbine fair Embalms with heaven's own essence heaven's own air; Not softer and not sweeter flew the gale, When we together trod this blooming vale; When far beyond the busy world's controul, Nature our guide, we open'd all the soul. Whence this neglect? say, in thy lov'd domain, Where all the virtues in thy presence reign; Where gathering round thee, youth and age conspire, While some as brother court thee, some as sire; Where all the social passions fondly blend, To give the smiling neighbourhood a friend; Where somewhat of thy gentle heart is seen, A grace, or goodness, adding to the green; Where the babe lisps thy bounties on the knee, And second childhood leans its crutch on thee; Whence this neglect? Ingratitude retreat! Go: and in shades less sacred fix thy seat: Go to the treach'rous world, thy proper sphere; But oh! forbear to scatter poisons here: About this dwelling and these harmless bounds, Friendship and love alone should take their rounds, Fair as the blossoms which the walls sustain, Rich as the fruits, and generous as the grain; Secure as yonder warblers nesting near, Like Honour steady, and like faith sincere. âBut soft, my friend! tho' shrubs and bow'rs remain The fix'd productions of th' unconscious plain; Though these no gentle sympathies can know, But as the planter bends them learn to grow; To higher parts as nature lifts her plan, The kinder creatures, haply, feel for man; The tame domestics, which attend his board, Haply partake the fortune of their lord, His presence hail, his absence long deplore, Droop as he droops, and die when he's no more Pleas'd at the thought, still onward let me tread, Where flocks and herds diversify the mead, Where breathing odours, winnow'd by the gale, Fan the soft bosom of the smiling vale; The rooks behind their brawling councils hold, And the proud peacock trails his train of gold; Around the doves their purple plumage show, And clucking poultry saunter, pleas'd, below; While there the house-dog, with accustom'd glee, Fawns on the hindâas late he fawn'd on thee. These crop the food, those press the flow'ry bed Nor weep the absent, nor bewail the dead; Their stinted feelings seem but half awake, Dull as yon steer now slumbering on the brake. Whence then the gloom that shrouds the summer sky? Whence the warm tear now gathering in my eye? And whence the change when bosom friends depart? From fancy striking on the feeling heart. Oh should I follow where she leads the way, What magic meteor to her touch would play! Then, far from thee, this sun which gilds my brow In deep eclipse would darken all below; The herds, tho' now plain reason sees them feed, Smit by her touch would languish in the mead; The breeze which now disports with yonder spray, The flocks which pant beneath the heat of day, The pendant copse in partial shadows drest, The scanty herbage on the mountain's crest, The balmy pow'rs that mix with every gale, The glassy lakes that fertilize the dale, Struck by her mystic sceptre all would fade, And sudden sadness brood along the shade. As poets sing, thus Fancy takes her range, Whose winds Ã¦thereal waves a general change; A change, which yielding Reason still obeys, For scepter'd Reason oft with Fancy plays; Soon as the gen'rous master leaves his home, What vision'd sorrows deep invest the dome? Soon as the much-lov'd mistress quits the scene, No longer smiles the grateful earth in green: In solemn sable ev'ry flow'r appears, And skies relent in sympathising tears! Scarce had the bard of Leasowe's lov'd domain Clos'd his dimm'd eye upon the pensive plain, Ere birds and beasts funereal honours paid, Mourn'd their lov'd lord and sought the desart shade; His gayest meads a serious habit wore, His larks would sing, his lambs would frisk no more, A deeper cadence murmur'd from his floods, Cimerian horror brooded o'er his woods: At ev'ry solemn pause, the raven scream'd, The sun set sanguine, and the dog-star gleam'd; But chief the conscious laurels droop'd their head, While every bower its leafy honours shed; Around his walks the Muses wander'd slow, And hung their lyres on every naked bough. Yet separate facts from fairy scenes like these, Nature, we find, still keeps her first decrees; The order due which at her birth was giv'n, Still forms th' unchanging law of earth and heav'n, In one fair tenor, on the circle goes, And no obstruction no confusion knows. When Shenstone, nay, when Shakespeare press'd the tomb, The shrubs that saw their fate maintain'd their bloom; Clear ran the streams to their accustom'd shore, Nor gave one bubble less, one murmur more; Nor did a single leaf, a simple flower, Or fade or fall to mark their mortal hour. But, is it Fancy all! what, no reserve? From one dull course can nature never swerve? Is change of seasons all the change she knows, From autumn's sickly heats to winter snows; From chilling spring, to summer's dog-star rage; From boy to man, from man to crawling age? These her transitions, ling'ring, sad, and slow, Whence then, in these lov'd shades, my bosom's woe? Ah! is it Fancy, that, with silent pace, Impels me thus to range from place to place; To see on ev'ry side an harvest bend, Yet look on ev'ry side to find my friend? Or is it fancy makes yon village train,â For now 'tis ev'ning,âsport around in vain? That plighted pairs, amidst the hazel boughs, By me unseen, impart their tender vows; While unsuspicious of a witness near, They mix with Nature's language, Nature's tear? That twilight's gentle grey which now comes on, To wait, a sober hand-maid on the sun, To watch his parting tinge, his soften'd fires, Then blush with maiden grace as he retires; The full-orb'd moon, which now ascending high Her silver shade throws light across the sky; The still serene that seems to lull the breeze, Soft in a leafy cradle 'midst the trees; The lessen'd sound of yonder distant bell, Some mournful moral in each pausing knell; The dropping dew that settles on my cheek, The frugal lights that from each cottage break; The just-dropp'd latch, the little lattice clos'd, To shield from evening's damp the babe repos'd, And note the hour when temperance and health Yield the pale vigils of the night to wealth. Say, is it vision'd Fancy works the charm, When these blest objects lose their power to warm? Ah! no; from other sources spring the smart, Its source is here, hard pressing on my heart. Yes, 'tis the heart, my friend, which rules the eye, And turns a gloomy to a cloudless sky; The soft magician governs ev'ry scene, Blossoms the rock, or desolates the green; Along the heath bids fancied roses blow, And sunshine rise upon a world of snow. Yes, 'tis the heart endears each smiling plain, Or to his native mountain binds the swain; His native mountain where his cottage stands, More lov'd, more dear, than all the neighb'ring lands; For tho' the blast be keen, the soil be bare, His friends, his wife, his little ones are there. Oh, had the brother of my heart been nigh, When morning threw her mantle o'er the sky; Or when gay noon a gaudier robe display'd, Or modest ev'ning drew her softest shade; Then had the shrubs breath'd forth their full perfume, And like his flow'rs my feelings been in bloom For still to prove the naturel bias right, Should each fair season with each sense unite. The bias social, man with men must share, The varied benefits of earth and air; Life's leading law, my friend, which governs all, To some in large degrees, to some in small; To lowest insects, highest pow'rs, a part Wisely dispens'd to ev'ry beating heart; A due proportion to all creatures given, From the mole's mansion to the seraph's heav'n. See the wing'd legions which at noon-tide play, Together clust'ring in the solar ray, There sports the social passion; see, and own, That not an atom takes its flight alone. Th' unwieldy monsters of the pregnant deep; The savage herds that thro' the forest sweep; The viewless tribes that populate the air; The milder creatures of domestic care; The rooks which rock their infants on the tree; The race which dip their pinions in the sea; The feather'd train, gay tenants of the bush, The glossy blackbird, and the echoing thrush, The gaudy goldfinch which salutes the spring, Winnowing the thistle with his burnish'd wing; Jove's eagle soaring towards yon orb of light; Aurora's Iark, and Cynthia's bird of night: All these the laws of Sympathy declare; And chorus heav'ns first maxim, born to share. Thus Instinct, Sympathy, or what you will, A first great principle, is active still; Shines out of every element the soul, And deep pervading, animates the whole; Floats in the gale, surrounds earth's wide domain, Ascends with fire, and dives into the main; Whilst dull, or bright, th' affections know to play As full, or feebly, darts this social ray; Dimly it gleams on insect, fish, and fowl, But spreads broad sunshine o'er man's favour'd soul. Man's favour'd soul then tracing thro' each state, Behold it fitted for a social fate; Behold how ev'ry link in nature tends One chain to form of relatives and friends. One chain, unnumber'd beings to confine, Till all affimilate and all combine. Yon spacious dome, which earth and sea commands, Where Lelius dresses his paternal lands; Where water gushes, and where woods extends, To share each beauty, Lelius calls his friends; A desert scene, 'till they adorn his bow'rs; A naked waste, till they partake his flow'rs, Nor this, though sweet, the greatest bliss he feels, That greatest bliss his modesty conceals. Pass the green slope which bounds his fair domain, And seek the valley drooping from the plain; There, in a blossom'd nook, by pomp unseen, An aged couple lead a life serene; And there, behind those elms, a sickly pair Exchange their labours for a softer care: 'Twas Lelius that gave to sickness this repose, And plac'd life's second cradle near th' rose; In his own hall though louder joys prevail, A dearer transport whispers from the vale; Though mirth and frolic echo thro' the dome, In those small cots his bosom finds a home. Fame, fortune, friends, can Providence give more? Go, ask of Heav'n the blessings of the poor! A greater comfort would you still supply? Then wipe the tear from Sorrow's streaming eye; For social kindness to another shown, Expands the bliss to make it more your own. Lo! the rude savage, naked and untaught, Shares with his mate what arts and arms have caught; When winter darkness clouds his long, long night, See how he strives to find the social light; His woodland wife, his forest children dear, Smooth the bleak storms that sadden half his year. For them he tracks the monster in the snow; For them he hurls his sling, and twangs his bow. Nor scorching sunshine, nor the driving show'r, Nor vollied thunder, nor the light'ning's pow'r, Nor climes, where sickness pants in every breeze, Nor worlds of ice, where nature seems to freeze, Check the fair principle, which bursts away, Like yon blest sun, when clouds attempt his ray. Hence, ever lean the feeble on the strong, As tender sires their children lead along; While, by degrees, as transient life declines, And blooming youth to withering age resigns, The social passion shifts with place and time, And tender sires are led by sons in prime; The guide becomes the guided in his turn, While child and parent different duties learn. Not then from fancy only, from the heart, Pours the keen anguish on th' immortal part, And Truth herself destroys the bloom of May, When Death or Fortune tears a friend away; From virtuous passion, virtuous feeling, flows The grief that dims the lily and the rose. Drops a soft sorrow for a friend in dust? There, Truth and Fancy both may rear the bust; While one pours forth the tribute of the heart; The other plies her visionary art, Potent she calls her airy spectres round, And bids them instant consecrate the ground; Fancy presides as sov'reign of the scene, And darkens every leaf of every green; Whilst Reason loves to mix with her's the tear, And the fair mourners form a league sincere; Her airy visions Fancy may impart, And Reason listen to the charmer's art. In life's fair morn, I knew an aged seer, Who sad and lonely past his joyless year; Betray'd, heart-broken, from the world he ran, And shunn'd, oh dire extreme! the face of man; Humbly he rear'd his hut within the wood, Hermit his vest, a hermit's was his food, Nitch'd in some corner of the gelid cave, Where chilling drops the rugged rockstone lave Hour after hour, the melancholy sage, Drop after drop to reckon, would engage The ling'ring day, and trickling as they fell, A tear went with them to the narrow well; Then thus he moraliz'd as slow it past, âThis, brings me nearer Lucia than the last; âAnd this, now streaming from the eye,â said he, âOh! my lov'd child, will bring me nearer thee?â When first he roam'd, his dog with anxious care, His wand'rings watch'd, as emulous to share; In vain the faithful brute was bid to go, In vain the sorrower sought a lonely woe. The Hermit paus'd, th' attendant dog was near, Slept at his feet, and caught the falling tear; Up rose the Hermit, up the dog would rise, And every way to win a master tries. âThen be it so. Come, faithful fool,â he said; One pat encourag'd, and they sought the shade; An unfrequented thicket soon they found, And both repos'd upon the leafy ground; Mellifluous murm'rings told the fountains nigh, Fountains, which well a pilgrim's drink supply. And thence, by many a labyrinth it led, Where ev'ry tree bestow'd an ev'ning bed; Skill'd in the chace, the faithful creature brought Whate'er at morn or moon-light course he caught; But the sage lent his sympathy to all, Nor saw unwept his dumb associates fall; He was, in sooth, the gentlest of his kind, And though a hermit, had a social mind: âAnd why, said he, must man subsist by prey, âWhy stop yon melting music on the spray? âWhy, when assail'd by hounds and hunter's cry, âMust half the harmless race in terrors die? âWhy must we work of innocence the woe? âStill shall this bosom throb, these eyes o'erflow; âA heart too tender here from man retires, âA heart that aches, if but a wren expires.â Thus liv'd the master good, the servant true, 'Till to its God the master's spirit flew; Beside a fount which daily water gave, Stooping to drink, the Hermit found a grave; All in the running stream his garments spread, And dark, damp verdure ill conceal'd his head; The faithful servant from that fatal day Watch'd the lov'd corpse, and hourly pin'd away: His head upon his master's cheek was found, While the obstructed waters mourn'd around. But sordid fouls are ever in distress, To bless himself each must a second bless; Then kindle on 'till he the world embrace, And in love's CÃ¦stus gird the human race. Thus social grief can finer joys impart Than the dull pleasures of a miser's heart: Thus with more force can melancholy warm, Than wild ambition's solitary charm. And oh, just heav'n, what gift canst thou bestow, What gem so precious as a tear for woe? A tear more full of thee, oh pow'r divine, Than all the dross that ripens in the mine! As man with man, with creature creature keeps, In summer feeds in view, in winter creeps More fondly close; but take the lamb apart From its lov'd mother, then the social heart 'Plains in its voice, while sad, the dam around Bleats at the theft, and leaves uncropt the ground. In yonder huts, at this profound of night, The twelfth hour striking as the line I write, In yonder scatter'd huts, now ev'ry swain, With ev'ry maid and matron of the plain, In sleep's soft arms on wholsome pallets prest, Breathe forth the social passion as they rest: But should dire fate the father make its prey, Or snatch untimely one lov'd child away; Or bear the faithful housewife to the tomb, Or should the damsel sicken In her bloom, No aid from fancy seeks the sorrowing heart, But truth, with force unborrow'd, points the dart. For me, as weary of myself I rise, To seek the rest which wakeful thought denies? O'er the lov'd mansion as I lonely range, Condemn'd at ev'ry step to feel the change; Through each apartment, where so oft my heart Hath shar'd each grace of nature and of art, Where memory marks each object that I see, And fills the bosom, oh my friend, with thee; Through each apartment as I pass along, Pause for relief, and then pursue my song; For me, who now with midnight taper go, To lose in sleep's oblivious shade my woe, No greater good my closing thoughts can bless, Ere this remember'd, little couch I press, Than the sweet hope that at this sacred hour My friend enjoys kind nature's balmy power; Than the soft wish which on my bended knee, I offer up, Eliza, warm for thee! Wife of my friend, alike my faithful care, Alike the object of each gentle pray'r; Far distant tho' thou art, thy worth is near, And my heart seals its blessing with a tear. END OF THE FIRST BOOK. BOOK II. And now again 'tis morn, the orient sun Prepares once more his radiant course to run; O'er yon tall trees I see his glories rise, Tinge their green tops, and gain upon the skies; The social principle resumes the shade, Basks on the banks, or glides along the glade: See how it pants, my friend, in yonder throng, Where half a village bears the sheaves along; Low stoops the swain to dress his native soil, And here the housewife comes to soothe his toil; While heav'n's warm beams upon her bosom dart, She owns the fondness of her wedded heart, From his damp brow the labour'd drop removes, And dares to show with what a force she loves; Where'er the mother moves, her race attend, And often cull the corn, and often bend; Or bear the scrip, or tug the rake along, Or catch the burthen of the reaper's song; Or shrinking from the sickle's curving blade, Cling to the gown, half pleas'd, and half afraid; While he who gave them life looks on the while, And views his little houshold with a smile; Imprints the kiss, then blessing ev'ry birth, Carols his joy, and hails the generous earth. But not to scenes of pleasantry confin'd, Though, hap'ly, simpler there, as less refin'd, Not circumscrib'd to these the social plan, Which more extends, as more pursu'd by man. Just as yon path-way, winding through the mead, Grows broad and broader by perpetual tread, The social passion turns the foot aside, And prompts the swains to travel side by side; Both edge, by turns, upon the bord'ring sod, And the path widens as the grass is trod. In cities thus, though trade's tumultuous train Spurn at the homely maxims of the plain, Not all the pride of rank, the trick of art, Can chase the generous passion from the heart: Nay more, a larger circle it must take, Where men embodying, larger int'rests make, And each, perforce, round each more closely twine, Where countless thousands form the social line. As slow to yonder eminence I bend, Gradual the views of social life extend, Where benches ease the steep ascent I stray, And stop at each to take a just survey; At every step, as sinks the vale behind, A wider prospect opens on mankind. Far to the right where those blue hills arise, And bathe their swelling bosoms in the skies, The barks of commerce set the flapping sail, And the dark sea-boy sues the busy gale; There the deep warehouse shows its native store, There flame the riches of a foreign shore; Thick swarm the sons of trade on every hand, And either India breathes along the strand; Gold, give me gold, each bustler cries aloud, As hope or fear alternate seize the crowd; To careless eyes the love of pelf alone, Seems to drain off the golden tide for one; But closer view'd a various course it takes, And wide meanderings in its passage makes; Through many a social channel see it run, In splendid heritage from sire to son; From thence in many a mazy stream it flows, And feels no ebb, no dull stagnation knows; Thus nature and necessity agree The social chain to stretch from land to sea. Thus e'en the miser, tho' his sordid soul Loves but himself, befriends perforce the whole. Ask you a stronger proof? Place wealth alone With some hard niggard, lock up all his own: Pile bills, and bags, and bonds upon his shelf, And a close prisoner chain him to his pelf. Unhappy man! from family and friends, From all which heav'n in soft compassion sends, From touch of kindred, tune of tender speech, And exil'd from the social passion's reach; How would he sigh, tho' every hope were vain, And buy a glance at man with half his gain! How, at some chink or crevice would he ply, And envy each poor beggar limping by! Far happier he, who breasting every wind, Lives on the common mercy of his kind, Who roams the world to tell his piteous case, And dies as last amidst the human race. Ye selfish friends, ye worshippers of gold, Who deem a passion lavish'd if unsold; Who farm the feelings with a statesman's art, And like base usurers, traffic with the heart: Who to that idol in its nich confine The holy incense due at nature's shrine; Say, can your sordid merchandize deny The sacred force of heav'n-born Sympathy? Ah, no! the gen'rous spirit takes a part, As goodness, glory, pity, move the heart. Else, why at fabled virtues do we glow? At fabled sorrows why with tears o'erflow? Why with the bleeding hero do we bleed, Why scorn the base; and love the gen'rous deed? Why, as with Homer's chiefs we rush to war, Each turn of varying fortune do we share? Why with the mourning wife of Hector mourn, With Priam weep, and with Achilles burn? Spite of your arts the sympathies arise, And aid the cause of all the brave and wise; Spite of your little selves, when virtue charms, To nature true, the social passion warms; Vain to resist, imperial nature still Asserts her claim, and bends us to her will. And Gold itself, tho' stigmatis'd with rage, Thro' many a rash, declamatory page, The gorgeous ruin by each bard decry'd, In tuneful scorn or philosophic pride, Wit's standing subject of supreme disgrace, And gravely call'd the curse of all our race, Yes Gold itselfâtho' soft Tibullus swears, In deafen'd Nemesis to all his prayers, Brib'd her false heart from passion's sacred fire, And loos'd her from the magic of his lyreâ Appears, my friend, the social pow'r to aid, Pure from the dust that clogs the wheel of trade. Full falsely charge we mother Earth with wrong, In all the wild licentiousness of song: Safe in her central caverns harmless shone This hoarded treasure of her ancient throne, In rich repose it slept within the mine, Nor wish'd to quit the subterraneous shrine, With parent caution, Earth who knew its powers, O'er the fair mischief strew'd her various flowers, While every flower her sweetest perfume bore, That her lov'd children might require no more MAN dragg'd the splendid stranger first to view, And, like a meteor, round the world it flew, A ready welcome from the world it found, And PhÅbus hail'd the PhÅnix from the ground. Immediate wonder seiz'd the circling crowd, But chief Europa to her idol bow'd, Her bark, her car, with emblems gilded o'er The homage spread from ocean to the shore; Attractive Gold obsequious votaries drew, Till useful fondness into dotage grew. Yet still be just. In shape of fraud or force, Ere Gold appear'd the Passions took their course; Like whirldwinds swept the flowers of life along, And crush'd the weak, and undermin'd the strong; Lord as thou wert, Tibullus, of the strains That sweetest paint an hapless lover's pains, Long, long ere execrated Gold from earth Arose to give each tender trespass birth, Full many a mistress knew, like thine, the art, To sport with vows, and practise on the heart. Let sage Tradition's reverend records tell, Unbrib'd by gold, what hosts in battle fell, Unbrib'd by gold,âwhen acorns were the food, And man with beast roam'd naked thro' the wood, Ev'n in those times which raptur'd bards have sung, When nature triumph'd, and the world was young, Blest days! whose charms so many lays rehearse, Blest days, alas! which only bloom in verseâ Ev'n then let Hist'ry tell what follies sped, Assail'd the hut, and thro' the forest spread; How daring guilt in proud obtrusion stood, And dy'd his dreadful robe in brothers blood; How son and sire, with unrelenting strife, Ensanguin'd sought each other's kindred life; How matrons stopt the new-born infants breath, And bold self-slaughter rush'd on impious death; How darkling error stain'd the blushing morn, And life's first roses bore the pointed thorn; How ages past exhibit all the crimes That random satire aims at modern times; How varying modes alone divide the plan Betwixt the savage and the social man; How ruder vices now refin'd appear, Adopting still the fashion of the year; Conclude we then the vices are the same, Conclude that Man, not Gold, is still to blame, Rail then no more at gold, for plain to view Behold an antidote and poison too: Oh save the shining metal from abuse, And the heart turns it to a social use! The widow, orphan, and ten thousand more, Prove that no dross need hang about the ore; Prove, that this glittering treasure may dispense The sterling joys of pure benevolence, While from the golden reservoir may flow The richest streams of sympathy below. In soft alliance with the tender heart, The senses too, their sympathy impart: No longer blessings than as all conspire With kindred zeal to fan the social fire. Of sight, or smell, say what the mighty power, If but to see the sun, or scent the flower? Of touch, taste, hearing, what the wond'rous boast, If narrow'd all to self, they all are lost? But ye of finer souls, who truly know The rich division of a joy and woe, Oh tell the rapture when a friend is nigh To charm the ear, or to delight the eye, To draw amusement from the pictur'd air, As fancy shapes her thousand visions there, Now paints her monsters, now her armies strong, When slow she drives her twilight car along: Oh tell the rapture that each pleasure wears, When the soul's friend each passing pleasure shares, When with twin'd arms ye watch the opening rose, Or trace the devious streamlet as it flows, Together mark fair summer's radiant store, Together nature's vernal haunts explore; And fondly jealous of each object new, Contend who first shall point it to the view; Then part awhile, o'er hill and valley stray, And anxious court the fortune of the day. But if long absent, hail'd be every power That blots the sunbeam and destroys the bower, That wraps th' affrighted atmosphere in storms, And each gay vision of the sky deforms, The social senses then partake the grief, And seek some kindred object of relief. Oh hark, my soul, to yonder Stockdove's note, Sweet as the woe from Philomela's throat; Soft let me steal along the copse to hear The mournful murmur break upon my ear; Ah, gentle bird! indulge thy tender pains, While the Muse greets thee with congenial strains, Nor quit thy sombrous seat, nor, needless fly The still, small breathings of a social sigh: That ruffled plumage, that disorder'd wing, More soothing now than softest blooms of spring, And that deep sob, to every sense more dear Than all the music of the vocal year. Blest be the hand that lends the power to feel, And frames us subject to the wounds we heal, That urges all to minister relief, And instant fly with open arms to grief; That veils the soft attraction in a tear, Each bliss makes poignant, and each sorrow dear; Eternal incense from the soul ascend To him who made each being want a friend, Who plac'd us in a world 'twixt sun and shade, That those which bloom might succour those that fade; And doubly bless'd the providence, whose skill In life's thin loom has woven many an ill; Tho' weak the texture, from that weakness springs The strength and beauty of all human things; For still as fate or nature deals the blow, The balms we now solicit, now bestow, And all our miseries but clearly prove The social powers of pity and of love. Ask the pale mother why 'tis joy to weep When o'er her stricken babe faint slumbers creep? Ask why the child at midnight's thickest gloom Still fondly lingers at a parent's tomb? Or why the wife, in times of raging death, Yet leans to catch her lord's polluted breath? Go, warn them straight of pestilential air, Point to the weakness here, the danger there, Let mirth and music all their powers employ, To spread for every sense its favourite joy, Then, arm'd with all the world's seductions try To wean the mourners from so dark a sky, Oh! they will spurn the offer'd gales of health, The lures of pleasure and the snares of wealth, Prefer the dark recesses of disease, The sickly pillow and the tainted breeze, And call it conscience, nature, bliss, to know The last extremities of social woe. Hence the great principle to all expands, Thaws Lapland's ice, and glows on India's sands; Above, below, its genial splendours play, Where'er an human footstep marks the way. âOh! for one track of man upon the snow, âThe trace of sweet society to show; âOh! for one print on swarthy Afric's shore!â Thus prays the wanderer 'scap'd from Ocean's roar; In every clime is felt the thorb divine, By land, by water, here, and at the Line. Nor climates only, but each age imparts The kindly bias to our social hearts. See the swath'd infant cling to the embrace, Th' instinctive fondness dawning in its face, See it, ascending, strengthen as it grows, Till ripe and riper the affection glows, Then view the child, its toys and trinkets share, With some lov'd partner of its little care: Behold the man a firmer bond requires, For him the passion kindles all its fires; Next, see his numerous offspring twining near, Now move the smile, and now excite the tear; Terror and transport in his bosom reign, Succession sweet of pleasure and and of pain, As age advances, some sensations cease, Some, lingering, leave the heart, while some increase: Thus, when life's vigorous passions are no more, Self-love creeps closest to the social power; The stooping vet'ran with time-silver'd hair, Crawls to the blazing hearth and wicker chair; There huddled close, he fondly hopes to spy His goodly sons and daughters standing by; To the lisp'd tale he bends the greedy ear, And o'er his children's children drops a tear; Or, every friend surviv'd, himself half dead, Frail nature still demands her board, her bed; And these some kindred spirit shall bestow, His wants supply, or mitigate his woe; Still Sympathy shall watch his fleeting breath, And gently lead him to the gates of death. Yet more; e'en war, the scourge of human kind, But serves more close the social links to bind; Confed'rate courage forms th' embattled line, Firm on each side connecting passions join; 'Tis social danger either troop inspires, 'Tis social honour either army fires, 'Tis social glory burnishes the van, 'Tis social faith spreads on from man to man; As front to front the warring parties meet, For social ends they dare the martial feat; As breast to breast, and eye to eye they fix, For social ends they seperate or mix. King, country, parents, children, prompt the fight, For these alone they bleed, resist, unite; And, hap'ly, first hostilities arose From nice distinctions made of friends and foes; Some scornful slight where nature most can smart, Some stinging insult forest to the heart, Some wrong detected, forfeited some trust, A treaty broken, or a barrier burst, Bade Sympathy call Vengeance to her aid, Till where the laws avail'd not wars were made; Affection sought from arms the wish'd relief, And bore them 'gainst the assassin and the thief; Eager o'er those who faith's fair league invade With social zeal to lift th' avenging blade; Or from the spoiler's hand to fence the flowers That sweetly blossom round life's private bowers: 'Tis thus, the steady eye of Reason finds What seems to snap the chain, more closely binds; And thus each peril like each pleasure try'd, Unites the rosy bonds on either side. But less do arms than arts assist the plan, Those may defend, but these embellish man; These softly draw him nearer to his kind, And mark distinct his seraph form of mind. Lo, in firm compact, hand, and head, and heart, To aid the system take an helping part, Their various powers by various modes they lend, And serve in union as one common friend; Hence, by consent, men clear the unthrifty wood, New model earth, and navigate the flood; Hence hamlets grow into the city's pride, While the soul opens, like the talents, wide. By social pleasure, social profit sway'd, Some soar to learning, and some stoop to trade. Studious to gain the love of human kind, The social sage at midnight stores his mind, Robs weary nature of her just repose, Nor drinks the dew that bathes the morning rose, Nor when the sun to Cynthia gives the night, Eyes the soft blessing of her tender light, But o'er the taper leans his pensive head, And for the living communes with the dead. The dusky artizan, his effort made; Asserts his rights, and leaves the sickly shade; At eve he quits the spot where glooms annoy, And seeks the bosom of domestic joy; The social faggot, and the light repast, Await to cheer him when his toils are past. And hence each class of Elegant and Great, Art decks the dome, and commerce crounds the street; The heav'n-born Muse impetuous wings her way, When her lov'd Seward seeks the realms of day; Queen of the comic power, hence Cowley wooes Fair visitations of the gayer Muse; The painter hence his magic pencil plies, And Reynolds bids a new creation rise; Hence Kauffman sketches life's lov'd forms anew, And holds the mirror of past times to view, Restores each grace that mark'd the Grecian age, And draws her lovely comment on the page; And still to chear the solitary hour, For this has A very ingenious and rising artist, who has painted for the Author an admirable portrait of the gentleman to whom this poem is inscribed: Mr. Beach still resides in Bath, where he is gaining that celebrity which is due to uncommon genius, and which nothing but uncommon modesty could so long have impeded. Beach display'd his happiest power; I see my friend upon the canvas glow, And feel the smile that lightens every woe. All, Sympathy, is thine; th' Immortal strung, For thee that more than golden harp the tongue: The sphere's best music taught it to impart, And bade each soft vibration strike the heart. Thine too, the varied fruitage of the fields, The clustering crops which yonder valley yields That thymy down where feeds a thousand sheep, This bower umbrageous, and yon cultur'd steep; The still smooth joys that bloom o'er life's serene, And all the bustle of its public scene. Nor think the dull cold reasoners, can disprove These varied powers of Sympathetic love; Nor hope, ye cynics, all your skill can find From partial spots a flaw in human kind; As well the panther might ye charge with sin, And call each streak a blemish on his skin; Allow to self the broadest scope ye can, Still breathe the social principle in man. Oft when pride whispers that he stands alone, His strength proceeds from other than his own; Oft when he seems to walk the world apart, Another's interest twines about his heart; And call his project rash, his effort vain, The end is social which he sighs to gain; Or say, this builds for pomp, that digs for bread, This shews you pictures, that a pompous bed, This toils a niggard at his lonely trade, That rears the bower but asks not to its shade; That this for vanity his wealth displays, As that for pride unravels learning's maze; Trace but their purpose to one general end, You see it work the good of wife, or friend, Parent or child their privilege still claim, And social comfort springs from what we blame, Frailty itself our sympathy may spare, A graceful weakness when no vice is there. Who hopes perfection breaks down nature's fence, And spurns the modest bounds of sober sense. When straw-like errors lean to virtue's side. Ah! check, ye bigots, check your furious pride. Some venial faults, like clouds at dawn of day, Blush as they pass, and but a moment stay; Those venial faults from sordid natures start, And spring up only in the generous heart, As florid weeds elude the labourer's toil, From too much warmth or richness of the soil; While meaner souls, like Zembla's hills of snow, Too barren prove for weeds or flowers to grow. This then is clear, while human kind exist, The social principle must still subsist, In strict dependency of one on all, As run the binding links from great to small. Man born for man some friendly aid requires, The contract strengthening till the soul retires; Nor then, ev'n then it breaks, for still we pay A brother's homage to the breathless clay; Jealous of destiny the heart would save Its favour'd object from the closing grave, Its favour'd object chosen from the rest, In grief, in joy, the monarch of the breast; To earth we trust what fondness would retain, And leave the corpse to visit it again; Nay, unconfin'd by partial ties of blood, We brave e'en peril for a stranger's good. Once, and not far from where those seats are seen, Just where yon white huts peep the copse between, A damsel languish'd, all her kin were gone, For God who lent, resum'd them one by one; Disease and penury in cruel strife, Had ravish'd all the decent means of life, E'en the mark'd crown, her lover's gift, she gave, In filial duty for a father's grave, That so the honour'd clay which caus'd her birth Might slumber peaceful in the sacred earth, Chim'd to its grass-green home with pious peal, While hallow'd dirges hymn the last farewel; At length these piercing woes her sense invade, And lone and long the hapless wanderer stray'd, O'er the black heath, around th' unmeasur'd wood, Up the huge precipiece, or near the flood; She mounts the rock at midnight's awful hour, Enjoys the gloom, and idly mocks the shower; Now scorns her fate, then patient bends the knee, And courts each pitying star to set her free, Then starting wilder, thinks those stars her foes, Smites her sad breast, and laughs amidst her woes; Oft would she chace the bee, or braid the grass, Or crop the hedge-flower, or disorder'd pass; Else, restless loiter in the pathless mead, Sing to the birds at roost, the lambs at feed; Or if a nest she found the brakes among, No hand of hers destroy'd the promis'd young; And when kind nature brought the balmy sleep, Too soon she woke to wander and to weep; Across her breast the tangled tresses flew, And frenzied glances all around shew threw; Th' unsettled soul those frenzied glances speak, And tears of terror hurry down her cheek; Yet still that eye was bright, that cheek was fair, Though pale the rose, the lilly blossom'd there. A wandering swain the beauteous Maniac found, Her woes wild warbling to the rocks around; A river roll'd beside, aghast she ran, Her vain fears startling at the sight of man; And, save me, God! my father's ghost! she cry'd, Then headlong plung'd into the flashing tide. The youth pursuesâbut wild the waters rose, And o'er their heads in circling surges close, Not heav'n-born Sympathy itself could save; Both, both alas! were whelm'd beneath the wave. And lives the man, who senseless could have stood To see the victim buffet with the flood? Whose coward cheek no tinge of honour feels, Flush'd with no pride at which the Muse reveals? If such a man, if such a wretch there be, Thanks to this aching heart, I am not he. Hail, lovely griefs, in tender mercy giv'n, And hail, ye tears, like dew-drops fresh from heav'n; Hail, balmy breath of unaffected sighs, More sweet than airs that breathe from eastern skies; Hail, sacred source of sympathy divine, Each social pulse, each social fibre thine; Hail, symbols of the God, to whom we owe The nerves that vibrate, and the hearts that glow; Love's tender tumult, friendship's holy fires, And all which beauty, all which worth inspires, The joy that lights the hope illumin'd eye, The bliss supreme that melts in pity's sigh, Affection's bloom quick rushing to the face, The choice acknowledg'd and the warm embrace: Oh power of powers, whose magic thus can draw, Earth, air, and ocean, by one central law; Join bird to bird, to insect insect link, From those which grovel up to those which think; Oh, ever blest! whose bounties opening wide Fill the vast globe, for mortals to divide, Thy heav'nly favours stretch from pole to pole, Encircle earth, and rivet soul to soul! Cease then to wonder these lov'd scenes impart No more the usual transport to my heart; Tho' modest Twilight visit Eve again, At whose soft summons homeward steps the swain; Though from the breath of oxen in the vale, I catch the spirit of the balmy gale, And from the brakes the answering thrushes sing, While the grey owl sails by on solemn wing; Nor wonder, if when morning blooms again, In discontent I quit the flowery plain. Thus the poor mariner, his traffic o'er, Crouds ev'ry sail to reach his native shore, With smiles he marks the pennons stream to port, And climbs the top-mast mast to eye the fort; Dim through the mist the distant lands appears, And far he slopes to hail it with his tears; From foreign regions, foreign faces come, Anxious he seeks his much-lov'd friends at home, Warm, and more warm, the social passions glows, As near and nearer to the place he goes; Quick beats his heart as pressing on he sees His own fair cottage canopy'd with trees; For there, in blessed health, he hopes to find His wife and cradled infant left behind; Panting, he plucks the latch that guards the door, But finds his wife, his cradled babe no more! Like some sad ghost he wanders o'er the green, Droops on the blossom'd waste, and loaths the scene Yet haply you, by Sympathy, may know That here a-while I paus'd to paint my woe, For sure if ever Silph or Silphid bore One true friend's message to a distant shore; If ever spirit whisper'd gentle deed, In such an absence most its aid we need.â Perhaps, for now let Fancy take her flight, My friend, like me, may wander thro' the night, Amidst a different scenery may roam, And many gentle sigh address at home; Ev'n now, where moon-beams tremble on the wave, And circling seagulls their long pinions lave, Where anchor'd vessels in the harbour ride, To wait the flux of the returning tide, Where the salt billow beats against the strand, My friend may take his solitary stand; Or to the rock projecting to the main, May sit him down to mark the social strain, Along the frothing beach may bend his way, And suit, like me, his sorrows to his lay. Farewel! my hour approaches with the dawn, And up I spring to leave the flowery lawn; The pain increases as I stay to trace Another sunshine rising o'er the place: Adieu then, balmy shrubs and shades, adieu, This passing incense o'er your leaves I strew; Adieu, thou dear and hill-screen'd cottage fair; Adieu, thou decent dome of Sunday prayer; To each, to all, adieu! your lonely guest Retire. The social passions speaks the rest. THE END. THE TEARS OF GENIUS. REVISED FROM THE SECOND EDITION, PRINTED IN 1775. THE TEARS OF GENIUS, OCCASIONED BY THE DEATH OF DR. GOLDSMITH. The village-bell toll's out the note of death, And thro' the echoing air, the length'ning sound, With dreadful pause, reverberating deep; Spreads the sad tidings, o'er fair Auburn's vale. There, to enjoy the scenes his bard had prais'd, In all the sweet simplicity of song, GENIUS, in pilgrim garb, sequester'd sat, And herded jocund with the harmless swains: But when he heard the fate-foreboding knell, With startled step, precipitate and swift, And look pathetic, full of dire presage, The church-way walk, beside the neighb'ring green, Sorrowing he sought; and there, in black array, Borne on the shoulders of the swains he lov'd, He saw the boast of Auburn mov'd along. Touch'd at the view, his pensive breast he struck, And to the cypress, which incumbent hangs With leaning slope, and branch irregular, O'er the moss'd pillars of the sacred fane, The briar-bound graves shadowing with a funeral gloom, Forlorn he hied; when, lo! the crowding woe (Swell'd by the parent) press'd on bleeding thought. Big ran the drops from his paternal eye, Fast broke the bosom sorrow from his heart, And pale Distress, sat sickly on his cheek, As thus his plaintive Elegy began: And must my children all expire? Shall none be left to strike the lyre? Courts Death alone a learned prize? Falls his shafts only on the wise? Can no fit marks on earth be found, From useless thousands swarming round? But must th' Ingenious drop alone? Must Science only grace his throne? Oh murd'rer of the tuneful train! I charge thee, with my children slain! Scarce has the Sun thrice urg'd his annual tour, Since half my race have felt thy barbarous power; Sore hast thou thinn'd each pleasing art, And struck a muse with every dart: Bard, after bard, obey'd thy slaughtering call, Till scarce a poet lives to sing a brother's fall. Then let a plunder'd parent pay The tribute of a parting lay. Tearful, inscribe the monumental strain, And speak aloud his feelings and his pain! And first, farewel to thee, my son, he cried, Thou pride of Auburn's dale Goldsmith.âsweet bard, farewel. Long for thy sake, the peasants tear shall flow, And many a virgin-bosom heave with woe, For thee shall sorrow sadden all the scene, And every pastime, perish on the green; The sturdy farmer shall suspend his tale, The woodman's ballad shall no more regale, No more shall Mirth, each rustic sport inspire, But every frolic, every feat, shall tire. No more the evening gambol shall delight, Nor moonshine revels crown the vacant night, But groups of villagers (each joy forgot) Shall form a sad assembly round the cot. Sweet bard, farewelâand farewel, Auburn's bliss, The bashful lover, and the yielded kiss; The evening warble Philomela made, The echoing forest, and the whispering shade, The winding brook, the bleat of brute content, And the blithe voice that âwhistled as it went.â These shall no longer charm the plowman's care, But sighs shall fill the pauses of despair. Goldsmith adieu! the âbook-learn'd priestâ for thee Shall now in vain possess his festive glee, The oft-heard jest in vain he shall reveal, For now alas, the jest he cannot feel. But ruddy damsels o'er thy tomb shall bend, And conscious weep for their and virtue's friend: The milkmaid shall reject the shepherd's song, And cease to carol as she toils along: All Auburn shall bewail the fatal day, When from her fields, their pride was snatch'd away; And even the matron of the cressy lake In piteous plight, her palsied head shall shake, While all adown the furrows of her face Slow shall the lingering tears each other trace. And, Oh my child! severer woes remain, To all the houseless, and unshelter'd train: Thy fate shall sadden many an humble guest, And heap fresh anguish on the beggar's breast. For dear wert thou to all the sons of pain; To all that wander, sorrow, or complain. Dear to the learned, to the simple dear, For daily blessings mark'd thy virtuous year; The rich receiv'd a moral from thy head, And from thy heart the stranger found a bed. Distress came always smiling from thy door; For God had made thee agent to the poor; Had form'd thy feelings on the noblest plan, At once to grace the Poet and the Man. Here Genius paus'd to dry the gathering tear, Which conscious Nature started in his eye. He paus'd an instant, then the strain renew'd. Thee too, thou favourite of the moral strain, Pathetic GRAY; for thee does GENIUS mourn: Science and Taste, thy early fate shall plain, And Virtue drop a tear into thy urn. Oft as Night's curtain closes on the day, And twilight robes the clouds in duskier hue, A love-lone visit to thy tomb I pay, While all the parent trembles at the view. For how to the unconscious worm a prey, So dear a child as thee can I resign? Ah, how can GENIUS e'er forget his Gray? Poet of Nature, all my powers were thine! On thy blest name, with melted heart I dwell, Some kindred drops, a loss like thine, demands; Thou, who could once for others, wail so well, Now take thy tribute from a father's hands. Tho' the grav'd tomb, and cloud aspiring bust To Cam's clear margin, call not back thy breath, Yet shall fair Fame immortalize thy dust, And GENIUS snatch thee from the realms of death. Oft as I reach the spot where thou art laid, Thou, whose bright sense could boast âcelestial fire,â Those hands, I cry, the Muses scepter sway'd, âAnd wak'd to extacy the living lyre.â One morn I miss'd thee from the favourite tree, And anxious search'd the brook, the lawn, the grove; Another came, but ah, it was not thee! Oh the keen tortures of a parent's love! Next, thro' the sculptur'd porch I saw thee borne In slow procession by the sable train, I saw thy corpse entomb'd beneath the thorn, And o'er thy ashes sigh'd this funeral strain. EPITAPH. Here low in dust, a son of Science lies, By fame distinguish'd, and to Genius dear; Forgive the fault, ye cynically wise, If on his grave the parent sheds a tear. Long shall the Muses mourn their pensive friend, Long shall a father's bosom throb with woe, O'er his lov'd tomb the duteous swains shall bend, And Albion's daughters long bewail the blow. Now sighing, stopt again the querulous power, And ruminated thoughtfulâo'er the turf, Swell'd into mountains by the mingled dead, He cast a serious eyeâand now the hours, The light-wing'd messengers of hoary Time, Brought on the fable zenith of the night, Cloudless and incompos'd by gale or shower, Save that the Zephir rising from the south, Rustled the light leaf of the spreading beech. Far thro' the cÃ¦rule air, the timid moon Her faint ray flung upon the shadowy earth; Struck by the scene, Imagination turn'd Reflective, on a loss still more severe; A loss that all the Muses mourn at once. The cheek of GENIUS stream'd with warmer tears, Deepen'd the searching sigh, and throbb'd the heart, As thus at length the bursting grief found way: Child of my heartâthou matchless soul of Song! Guide of fair Truth, and lead star of Fame, Etherial in thy talents, as thy mind, Wise as all wisdom here below could be, Sublimely tuneful, but not more sublime Than delicateânor more refin'd, than good; For Virtue ever brighthen'd in thy lay, And beam'd fresh graces thro' thy ardent song; A song, that dar'd a flight above the spheres, CÃ¦lestially ambitious; Heaven-inspir'd, Thy hopes angelic, and thy theme a God!â Thou Muses miracleâthou Nation's pride, Whose worth, yon silver Queen of night proclaim'd, When thou her pitying sympathy address'd, Whose wisdom all our sages loudly praise, Sages of science, by deep thought made sage, Whose virtue, Immortality rewards, Whose GENIUS, scorning narrow human ken, And the pent limits of this pigmy world, (Where in a circle circumscrib'd by fate, The mole-ey'd mortal dimly gazes round, And boasts his deep sagacity of sight; Important emmetâpride-elated mite, Infinite atomâmomentary wormâ) Superior soars to scenes behind the cloud, Oh YOUNGâthou day-bright poet of the night, Accept sincere the genuine plaint of woe Maternalâstruck immediate from the heart; An heart that labours deep with various grief! And thou, Oh Cynthiaâthou who lent thine aid CÃ¦rulian; and shed thy influence round, Chearing the darkness of thy Poet's fate; A fate envelop'd deep in Fortune's gloom, Dark beyond all the horrors of the night, When intercepting clouds repel thy rays, And not a gleam softens the black opaque, Genius, cherubic,ânear allied to Heaven, Of heavenly themes ambitiousâOh my Son! Oh, what a stroke upon the feeling heart! Oh what a fall to Britain, and to me! And rises then my sorrow into guilt, Verges my fondness on impiety, Reason, religion, duty, all forgot? I almost mingle blushes with my woe, Confusion flings her crimson in my cheek, And colouring Conscience dyes a deeper red! Fall, did I say?âsay rather what a rise! A rise high-bounding to his native skies, How great! how vast! how glorious! how profound! To us how vitalâto himself how fair? He wish'd for Heav'n, and Heav'n has heard his prayer. Then let me hail his beatific shadeâ The well-rewarded spirit bower'd in bliss!â Yet Nature, feeble Nature, clinging to the chords, And pressing hard upon the tender strings, That move the finer feelings in our frame, With arbitrary rage, demands her right, And usurer-like exacts the parent-sigh. Spite of the exultations I should feel, The hymn of triumph, and the peal of praise, The tender tyrant tugs about my breast, Strikes on each pulse, and sluices every veinâ Ah rebel nerves, be stillâor if too hard, The thoughts of losing him the most ador'd, Bears on thy weaker senseâindulge a pause, From NatureâPassionâTorture and Thyself. Oh, turn my soul from the distracting theme, Probe not the agonizing wound to deep, Search not the sore with too minute an eye, But from his dear idea, turn away! He turn'dâhe stoptâbut found no sweet relief; The cormorant monster of the gorging grave, Had multiplied his woeâstill ran his thoughts On some lov'd child, which yet remain'd unsung; Another and another to his mind Rose terribleâand starting, thus he cried, While Grief in every feature wrote Despair: And shall I pass thee o'er, thou gentle spirit?âWas there ought in thy propensionsâor in thy way of journeying through the windings of this sad world?âWas there ought unfilial in thy feelings?âought undeserving or forbidding, that should incline me to overlook thee?âAh; NoânoâTrust me, gentle YORICK, I more than lov'd theeâThere was a courtesy in thy demeanorâa milky and humane temperature about thy pulsesâand a compassion in the turn of thy mindâhowever excursiveâhowever retrogradeâhowever digressiveâthat awaken the most tender recollectionâA recollection which hurries the blood into the most affectionate extremities.âGracious God, what a throb was there!âAs I liveâand as I love theeâand by the soul of thy venerable relation, the tears are bathing my eye-lashes, while I am talking of theeâAnd could'st thou â(Oh that Death should have made it necessary to cry alas! in a parenthesis)âcould'st thou, YORICK, at this moment, lay thy hand upon my heartâthe violence of the motion about the center, would confess the motherâand the tumult of the vessels, together with the rebounds of the pulsation, might assure thee, how thou art rank'd in my estimationâEstimation!âhear me, Yorick, there is another Alas for theeâThou can'st not hearâGenius has much to say of theeâThou wert nothing elseâThy heart, and head, and every delicate appendage, were the constant champions of all the Charitiesâall the Civilities.âThou had'st not, indeed any paradeâany ostensibilityâor religious prudery about theeâbut yet hast thou done more to the cause of Virtue, than if thou had'st gone scowling through life.âIn all thy excursionsâand whimsical meandersâSensibility took thee by the handâby the heart I might have saidâand made thee accessible to every tender entreatyâevery soft petition found its way into thy pocketâthe thing was irresistibleâPity seconded the request, Sympathy thirded itâand if thou haply had'st nothing to bestowâwhy it was an hard case, and would cost thee a tearâa drop of disappointmentâan elixir to the sorrowing soulâa treasure rising from the fulness of a rich heart, and it was given without grudgingâso would it, had it been chrystal.âI honour thy sentiments, and I venerate thy memoryâthou would'st not suffer a nettle to grow upon the grave of an enemyânor shall Genius ever suffer a weed to grow upon thine.âPeaceâpeace to thy shade. Once more did Genius cease the mournful lay, But the fresh anguish soon assail'd his heart; Still call'd the populous tomb for his lament, And bade him prove vicissitude of woe, As thus he sighing, spoke: And now, my lov'd Shenstone, for thee, Thou pride of the pastoral strain; Thou fairest resemblance of me, Dear elegant Bard of the plain. For thee, will I pour the sad lay, That shall echo the thickets among; And weep as I muse on the day, That robb'd the poor swains of thy song. Full gentle, and sweet, was the note That flow'd from his delicate heart, Simplicity, smil'd as he wrote, And Nature was polish'd by art. But now as I look o'er thy bowers, As each shrub, and each stream, I survey, Disaster invades the soft flowers: Forâohâtheir lov'd master's away. Ah, how should the woodlands be fair, Ah, how the cool grottoes be gay? The groves murmur death and despair, The roses all droop and decay; Full well may they sorrow and fadeâ The dear shepherd that rear'd them is gone, And well may the birds leave the shadeâ For their loves and their labours are flown. Then unseen let the eglantine blow, Unheeded the hyacynth lie, Unheard let the rivulets flow, Let the primroses flourish and die, For the swain who should crop them is gone!â He sungâand all Nature admir'd; He spokeâand all hearts were his own; He fellâand all pity expir'd.â Scarce had he finish'd his disasterous song, When thus again lamenting, he beganâ I. And oh (he cried with frantic grief) Who now shall bring relief, Or where the cordial shall I find, To soothe a parent's mind, Since Lyttelton is dead? Well may ye hang the head, And press your grassy bed, Ye conscious forests, and ye waving groves, For never shall ye see your master more: To other scenes the Ã¦therial spirit roves, And tir'd of Hagley, seeks a fairer shore. II. The Muses listen'd to his polish'd strain, And every wondering swain, With pride, came thronging to his rustic bower, The Dryads own'd his power. But when he wail'd his lovely Lucy dead, And his melodious sorrow told, The shepherds lean'd to hear, The Silvans dropt a tear, Then all in wild disorder fled. 'Rapt in the deepest shades recess, They mourn'd their gentle Lord's distress, And join'd his prayers for Lucyâbut in vain. III. And art thou gone, my venerable son, Who shar'd with Genius the exalted throne! Pride of my age, and pillar of my care!â Mute is thy tuneful voiceââO loss beyond repair.â Ah Lyttellon, for thee, The true tear long shall bathe this parent breast, For there thy worth, and talents live imprestâ Engrav'd by Sympathy. Oh! fall severely felt, To make a parent melt, The tender breast to tear; And wake despair: And scarce a child the mighty-grief to share! IV. How shall I paint the glories of his mind, Benevolent, and kind, His reason strong, and elegantly clear, To every virtue dear! Beyond the pride of pedant rules, And maxims of the schools, Ah well, he knew the pleasing art, To steal upon the heart: To touch the finer passions of the mind, And give the sterling moral to mankind. V. He was the very glory of my race, Even in the vale of life, in reason's bloom, Adorn'd with every learned grace, Amidst the shouts of power and praise, For many a year he wore the bays; Till tyrant Death Stopt his much-honour'd breath, And swept the laurel'd Hero to the tomb. So when some oak, that long supreme hath stood, The stately monarch of th' imperial wood, Whose arms superior shed a verdure round, And shadow'd wide beneath, th' umbrageous ground, Long time we view its top impierce the skies, Its broad leaf flourish, and its branches rise, Long time we gaze upon the glowing sight, And eye with wonder its majestic height, Till time, impatient for its destin'd prey, Full at the root directs the blow, And down it drops below; The mighty ruin, of the groaning plain. Nor, in lamenting the havock, which Death hath triumphantly made (continued Genius) in the letter'd generation, can Hawkesworth, be forgotten: A name which is particularly endear'd to me, by the affection which its owner bore to virtue and to science. Every stroke of his pen, corresponding with every idea in his mind, however playful, or however pathetic, always terminated in the most useful knowledge: that knowledge which might regulate the conduct of life, or afford tranquillity and quietude at the hour of expiration. The ardour which uniformly animated his endeavours, gave constant vigour to his thought, activity to his powers, and dignity to his sentiment: Nor did his excellence arise so much from the ambition which panted after fame, and aim'd at popularityâwhich apppeal'd to the acclamations of the mob, or sought the distinctions of this world; as from the hearty hope of contributing, in whatever degree, to the investigation of truth, the amendment of manners, and the rectitude of the mind. Of those who have acquir'd a literary immortality, there are few who could dispute with my Hawkesworth, strength of sense, or elevation of expression; and still fewer have given to the world so valuable, or so copious a fund of virtuous entertainment. Amidst all the efforts of his intellect, whether his instructions were prepared in the dress of historyâor convey'd in the vehicle of fabulous narrationâwhether they assum'd the graver style of argumentative profundity, or whether they adopted the still deeper researches of philosophical raciocination;âtheir constant greatness of design was equally apparent, and the promotion of virtue was always strongly mark'd in the language of the writer. My dear, my regretted Hawkesworth, was indeed never long seduc'd by any temptations, or abstracted by any scientific allurements, from those views which are alone of intrinsic importance, and which he well knew, would retain that importance, when all that now flutters to the fancy, plays upon the passions, or fascinates the heart, shall confess their insignificance, and fly like the atom, that is driven before the tempest. Here, interrupting, broke upon his plaint The peering mornâthe dun-discolour'd clouds, Dispersing fast, unveil the fleecy white: Fair dawns the new-born-day; and o'er the sky The ruddy crimson, and the heaven-dipt blue, Mix'd with the fainter yellow's streaky gold, Chequering the air in rich variety, Fortell the Sun's upriseâfrom his broad beam, (Too garnish for the melancholy mind) GENIUS withdrew, and clos'd his tender lay. THE END. THE ART OF RISING ON THE STAGE. A POEM. CANTO I. To grace the elbow chair of age, Roscius the Monarch of the Stage, Resolv'd to lay the sceptre down, And make his exit from the town. His purpose fix'd, he summon'd strait, The Lords and Commons of his State, A motley tribe as you shall see; The Theatre's variety; From Madam Yates to Columbine: He summon'd them, exact at nine, Exact at nine, the parties came, Some known to Famine, some to Fame. In the same room, for once, they met; The tragic ladies, took their seat: The little lords, were on the scout And fairly wish'd themselves without: The gentlemen, stroll'd here and there Till Roscius came, and took the chair: He stood, in attitude profound, And thus address'd the circle round. Princesses, Potentates, and Peers, Behold me in the vale of years: My friends and favourites adieu, Lo I am come, to part with you. Full forty years, in various places, Have I, alas, been making faces: During which time, as ye can tell, Much have I talk'd of heaven, and hell; Myself have stabb'd, through every part; And often broke my pliant heart; Imaginary crimes committed, Been hated, scorn'd, admir'd, and pitied: My father strangled, kill'd my brother, And play'd the devil with my mother; To day a fool, to-morrow wiser, A monarch, manager, and miser. How oft ye powers this hand has press'd, In mimic agony, my breast; How oft I've died with pleasing pain, How oftne have I âslew the slain;â How oft the hated tyrant play'd, And kill my man, and kiss'd my maid. Not Sir John Hill, so much has wrote, As I have spoken through my throat; Hard fate, my friends, thus to rehearse Each year, a waggon load of verse; We, when the bard has lost his gift, Have kindly given the man a lift, When weighty matters poets cobble, And their gall'd jades begin to hobble, The player, doctors up their feet, And makes them seem both sound and fleet; This have I doneâwith your assistance,â Tho' sometimes, have scarce sav'd my distance: Bards, now a days, would lose the race, If players did not mend their pace, So apt their hackneys are to trip, That did we not work spur and whip, Scarce is there one among them all, But woud, ere course the second, fall; To tell you then my serious wish, I'm tir'd of this dramatic dish, Farewel, a long farewel to verse, Hail honest prose, hail honest purse; I'm on the edges of threescore, 'Tis time to give the plaything o'er; I need not counterfeit a wrinkle! Beholdâit strikes you in a twinkle! The step of sixty, as I stir Ye see, ah me! 'tis angular! Age is unfit for rant and riot, Now determine to be quiet; No more will I the Proteus play, But choose henceforth the private way: Nay, my good friends, you need not stare, By yonder blessed moon I swear! As actor, manager, and poet, âI've done some service, and ye know it:â I've had my struggles, like the moor, A time there was, when I was poor: Now farewel hair-breadth 'scapes, and slavings, Hailâhailâthrice hail, my little savings: I never coveted such stuff, Put shall retire, with just enough To line my evening couch with down, And keep my cottage out of town, My homely Hampton hut I mean, Altho' a plain, a pleasant scene; These palaces ill suit with age, Mine is the season to be sage; And that the modest reason, why I lay this bustling business by: Altho' of players, I am king, The fearful hour is on the wing When I, and other monarchs, must Lay our mock royalties in dust; An awful part remains to act, The baseless vision yields to fact: Such is my purpose, such my plan; No more the actor, but the man. Then friends farewel, but ere I quit These well known scenes of sense and wit; These ever-honour'd, sacred boards, Where such a levee grand, of lords, Where Kings and queens so oft have stood, And diedâwith little loss of blood; Where conquerors of every clime, Have, night by night, harangued in rhime; And, by the aid of good blank verse, Stout heroes, have improved their curse: Where dukes, of every sort and size, Have complimented ladies eyes; Where chiefs, have fought their country's cause, And statesmen made, and unmade laws; Where countesses, have drain'd the bowl, Or stabb'd the form, to save the soul; Where virgins, rather than submit, Their pretty panting hearts have hit; Where all of us, have had our blows, Our sieges, battles, joys, and woes; My eyes will linger to this spot, Till you my last advice, have got. The actors is a dangerous trade, Take then a recipe I've made, Twill move the soul, and mend each feature, I'm told, there's not the like in nature, And as a proof, 'twill bear the test, Me, it hath madeâProbatum est. Take first a well-siz'd Looking-Glass, âAnd view your shadows as you pass:â Manage each motion of the eye, And learn, at will, to laugh and cry, Observe to step, and start, with grace, And call up meaning, in the face: Walk not too narrow, nor too wide, 'Tis like Sir Punch, to strut and stride: As bad it is, to jerk, and run, Pray ladies, copy Abington. Observe the breeding in her air, There's nothing of the actress there: Assume her fashion if you can; And catch the graces of her fan. Learn in her mirror, how to stare, To smile in joy, to droop in care: With ease, âto catch the cloud, and in it âPaint the fair Cynthia of the minute Pope.:â Change passions with the changing scene, And methodise like her your mien, In drawing off her glove, you'll see, She has been used to company. Pray heroes never pause too long, A trick I got, when I was young, A trick, my enemies have told, But habits, seldom leave the old. The glass may teach, to bow and kneel, But heaven alone can make you feel: From that fair fount, the truth must flow, Yet art can make a shift you know; I've found it frequently supply, The want of sensibility. But oh, 'twill take up all your leisure, Ere of such toil you make a pleasure; For where dame Nature is unkind, And scarcely half makes up the mind; While Fortune, like a scurvy jade, Tosses that mind, upon our trade, It follows, as a clear effect, That notwithstanding such neglect, If Nature will not do her part, The business must be done by art. In stage-affairs, as in a watch, There's many a wheel, and many a catch, In both the mechanism's fine, Your lookers-on, can ne'er divine, What a mere juggle 'tis to play; And yet this juggle does, I say. Who only views the watch's face, Conceive not what's within the case; Enough for them, if truth it tell, And bids Sue roast the mutton well, The fine machinery they miss; As 'tis in that, so 'tis in this. I would not have you then despair, Tho' Nature, should her blessing spare, Tho' some of you should feel no more, Than Dunstan's giants o'er church door: Sheer art, may move a man about, Pray who's to find the secret out? Take heed, 'twill seem all skill and knowledge, Might pose the fellow of a college. Have you not seen, in Lear, and Fool, Where players often rave by rule, The calling outâa mouse, a mouse, Has fairly taken in, the house. If well the changeling throws his hat, Make sure of your applause for that: One minute marks a start, at most, But, if on entrance of a ghost, You stamp but loud enough, and fix, Instead of one, you may take six: 'Twere well indeed, if, when it's come, With dext'rous dash of hand, or thumb, You caus'd the hair, to stand an end; As that would much the horror mend: When Hamlet's phantom you pursue, Gaze, as if every lamp burnt blue: But when its errand you would know, Take care, to stagger as you go: Then, as it waves you, not to vex it, Let the sword tremble in your exit. To make King Richard, there's a knack; Be perfect, in the leg, and back; The eyebrow, should be broad and dark: And give to murder, every mark His fell complottings and designs, Should startle in the face's lines; Give him the dark assassin's airs And catch the audience unawares. Much, much, dear folks, depends on dress; The seemly ruff of royal Bess, The flourish, when she gives the blow, The royal train, and furbelow, The thundering boast of blustering Pierre, The straw-made crown of crazy Lear, Othello's face, Ophelia's willow, And Desdemona's strangling pillow: Your hose, ye fair, when boys you play, White chins, when age is in decay, Fat Falstaff's shield, and mountain belly, Are half the battle, let me tell ye: If once the galleries give the hand, A fig, for those that understand, The men of taste you know, are rare, The boxes seldom heed the player: The critic's hiss at classic flaws, Is buried in the fool's applause. Is genius wanting?âtrust to trick, It is the actor's walking-stick: There are, who use it every year: Tho' none of my good people here. Where there is geniusâin such cases, The passions know their proper places; Just where they ought, behold them rise, Or flow in tears, or heave in sighs: They animate the brightest jest, And mighty nature stands confest: What, therefore, I remark'd, at first, Was putting matters at the worst; As providence bestow'd the power, I ne'er could bear finesse an hour: My Archer, is your comic sample, And Lear affords a grave example. Of other points, there are a few, That I will now reveal to you. And first, it would not be amiss, But here and there prevent a hiss, If some of you would condescend A certain careless air to mend; 'Tis villainous to search the pit, To find where your admirers sit. Nor is it well, to stare on high, Intriguing with the gallery: Or to the boxes, give your eyes, While on the stage a lady sighs: Believe me, there is much to play, Ev'n when you have no more to say: Some, at the close of every speech, Will, saucy, turn upon their breech; Never conclude your business past, Till act the fifth, and line the last. Oft have I been the friend in danger, When him I lov'd, stood like a stranger; And tho' next scene I was to die, By draught, or dart, or sympathy: The fellow was so lost to feeling, I might as well have hugg'd the ceiling; One of his hands, indeed, was near To take my tributary tear; While eyes and lips were making love, And set to trap the nymphs above. Sure, gentlemen, you'll grant me this: A time to act, a time to kiss; Refrain but till the curtain's down, Then Ranger-it thro' all the town. And faith, my friends, there's no excuse, Where kissing, is so much in use, The modern stage, is no way slack, In granting ye an honest smack: I cannot recollect the play, Where poets do not shew the way; We've scarce a scene of tragic bliss, But they have introduc'd a kiss, And when a heroine's at her gasp, She always gives a loving clasp; Or if a comedy's their forte, There's always something of that sort. The drama now, however chaste, In tender matters, near the waist; Tho' they run round and round the riddle, Girding a cestus 'bout the middle: Yet all who deal in deaths and faintings, Our dapsters at dramatic paintings, However artfully, each draws O'er sacred parts the virtuous gauze: There's none so churlish to dispute, The players right to a salute. It now remains, ere I go hence, To thank you, for your diligence. Sickness, 'tis true, will oft disable: Pretended sickness, is a fable; The papers, have been full of this; I Nature blame for every miss; At Duty's call you all would come, Butâthat you could not get from home: Nay you'd have ventur'd in a chair, Had you not fear'dâthe evening air. I know a lady's resolution, But who can help her constitution? And had you left your hoods and screens, You might have died behind the scenes. I credit not the idle tale, âHe is not sick, she does not ail,â I've seldom pry'd for your complaint, Convinc'd, you were above a feint, But sure, of your indisposition, A practice with Mr. Garrick, when he suspected a Lady thought proper to be taken ill.Have kindly sent you my physician. Some may have had it much at heart, Because they did not like a part. Some fair ones have been apt to quarrel, And could not fancy their apparel: It seems I've too much trimm'd a train, When 'twould have prettier look'd, if plain: I have not always pleas'd my beaux In the division of the cloaths: I have given gold, for silver lace, And sometimes suited ill, a face: Complexions differ, and stage dresses, Should always match the skin and tresses: But far from me the blame may pass, The fault was inâthe Looking-Glass: Ladies, indeed it told not truth, Whate'er you wore improv'd your youth; And when you were displeas'd with me, I help'd to dress a deity. Perhaps, a word may be expected, Of Bards, who think themselves neglected. It is no easy task, to rule The scribbling tribe, and every fool, Who pelts a man with manuscripts, And crowds on him, mishapen slips; Things, half begot, and born in pain, The very FÅtus of the brain. Some of you know, my window-seat; The piles of paper, there you meet, Are but the bastards of the day, From trash, that spawn a mushroom play: Abortions, sprung from parents poor, That lieâlike foundlingsâat my door: In charity, I take them up, Altho' not worth my caudle-cup: The sire, without dramatic sap, How can the son be rear'd by pap? Yet all, I keep a decent time, In ragged swatheing-cloths of rhime: Then, beg the fathers to attend Andâtake them to another friend. I'm charg'd, with scorning babes of wit, A charge, for which I've answer fit. Extract a moral, from a tale: A grazier, once had steers for sale; Horses just broke, and heifers grown, Pigs, calves, and other kine, his own; To market, as he went one day, A neighbour stopp'd him on the way. Dobson, said he, as you know well, Both how to buy, and how to sell, As I, to-day, must watch the house, (For mother midwife's with my spouse) 'Twill be a kindness, Dob. if you, Will bargain for my oxen too: None better knows when beasts are fat, You are a judgeâI must say that. The grazier, from pure love to John, Jog'd with the cattle gently on. A mile beyond, one Thomas Staver, Beg'd, with a smile, an equal favour, Talk'd of lameness in his legs, And press'd upon him all his eggs: It was not Dob's denying day, So, with his load, he trudg'd away. But just as if 'twas ne'er to end, Hard by, he saw a female friend: She too, had met a bad disaster, For which repose would prove a plaister: How much, she said, would he oblige, If he would take her Friday's cheese? The grazier, though almost weigh'd down Agreed, and toiling, went to town. And now, came on, our grazier's care; 'Twas sultry noon when he got there. Off went his horses, to his mind, His heifers, did not stay behind: His lambkins, bore a market price, His hogs, found buyers in a trice. The market then was at a stand; His neighbours' goods, remain in hand, He scarcely sold an egg an hour, And night at last began to lower: Longer to stay, would be in vain, And so he drove them back again. The man with the rheumatic legs, Who was the owner of the eggs, The swain, who sent the oxen too, Now on our luckless grazier flew; They tore his coat, they bruis'd his eye He was at last, compell'd to fly. Yet, how was the poor man to blame, He would have sold, if buyers came: He could not force the beef, or cheese, The town was full of purchases; The moral, is worth every other, Serve first yourself, and then a brother; To serve a brother first, is right, Provided self gets double by't: But mind that you get pleasure too, That sanctifies whate'er you do: 'Tis past dispute, and stands reveal'd By men of noteâsee, Chesterfield; Authority we have no better, It is the sense of every Letter. For that it was, I sav'd my gold, For that I bought, for that I sold. My friends, I have no more to say, I wish you long to live, and play: And when, like me, you've sav'd a pittance, Make your last bows, and cry, acquittance.â The Green-room, echoed approbation, And thus broke up the Convocation. END OF THE FIRST CANTO. CANTO II. When mighty revolutions come, Shrill sounds the trump, loud beats the drum, I speak, by tropeâconceive me right, Not drums, made use of in the fight: But those more general alarms, That summon kingdoms up to armsâ Again I strike on metaphor, These things in rhiming will occur; Sure as guns pop by pulling trigger, Pen but a verse, off goes a figure. Altho' our greatest merits lie, Far from such quaint embroidery, True 'tis, that young poetic sinners, Who at the trade, are but beginners, Find it extremely hard to rein The ideas of the buxom brain: When spirits boil, and fancy rages, What glare and gew-gaw gild the pages! For Fancy then is in her prime, And sweetest sings in summer-time; Then full in feather and in song, Like birds she warbles all day long. And hence the stripling poet goes To compliment the blooming rose, Pours forth his tuneful soul in love, Bedecks the garden, grot, and grove, Scorns to see things, like other men, But, with an alchemy of pen, Hies to the shepherd's fleecy fold, And turns the greasy wool to gold: Hath posied words for every flower, First makes, and then describes his bower. Meet such a bardling in your walk, Perchance you find him, deep in talk: Or 'neath the branches, with a book; Or listening to a lazy brook; Prosemen, dull wights, would deem him mad, But Fancy calls him sweetly sad; Reason pronounces lost in folly; This darling child of Melancholy, For what plain people call a bird, Poets have clear another word: A plumy songster, feather'd friend, If proper name, an a at end, Not bullfinch, greenfich, goldfinch, chaf, A more mellifluous sound by half, 'Tis not the vulgar nightingale, But Philomela, tells the tale; 'Tis not the linnet gives its note, But Lillinetta pours her throat: What dull folks call the beetle's flight, Bards call the messenger of night: And when the day is gone to bed, On Thetis' lap he lays his head, The poet's eye can see him swim, And tinge with gold the ocean's brim: Then, that which mortals call the dawn Is open'd, by the ruddy morn: And certain streaks of rising red Mark where her rosy fingers spread, Lambs, are the types of innocence; Lillies, and snow, dispute that sense; Nay every leaf, on every tree, Affords the bard, a simile: And every tender bud, that blows, An epithet, or thought bestows. Alliteration too is nigh, A hand-maid hir'd by poesy: In uniform to dress her fine, And liquidate the lovely line, Bid fountains flow, and branches bend, Rocks rugged rise, and dews descend, Cold caterachs crash, and rivers rumble, Great Gorgans glare, and Giants grumble; Now, some may thinkâJove help their heads! It is mere dust a mortal treads, I cannot pity such, enough, We authors, know 'tis no such stuff: The velvet carpet Nature gives, She offers it, and man receives: Wish we to change the phrase again, 'Tis the green mantle of the plain; 'Tis Heaven's own livery, silken sod, But, by no means a kneaded clod: 'Tis tissue, wove by hands divine, 'Tis all that's fair, and all that's fine. But to proceedâhenceforth my muse, Grown grave, shall modest edging choose: The fairy days of verse are o'er, Content with sense, she dares not soar: Such freaks she leaves to youngsters green, The pretty sportings of eighteen; But the sage muse who scribbles this, Is now no more a tripping miss; The fever of her fancy cool, She rhimes and reasons all by rule. The morning registers of fame, Soon set the city in a flame: A favourite player to retire, Is worse than the alarm of fire: The ignis fatuus of the stage, Runs ripe and rapid through our age: And though two mighty nations wait, Upon the councils of the state; Yet like true patriots at the heart, We look when Roscius plays a part: Whate'er's theatrical devour, And give to him, th' eventful hour. The papers told, that he resign'd; At this you guess the public mind: Hang all the folks across the main, So Roscius, would but act again. Next day, the matter was averr'd; Certain the patent was transferr'd; Song, sonnet, ditty, sought the press, And half the town was in distress. The matter scarce abroad had flown, Ere it arriv'd at Helicon; Swift to the muses' laurell'd court, A poet went to make report; For poets, be it noted, go, On such affairs, incognito: And tho' to sceptics, it seem odd, In point of speed, shall match a god: They stride not, ordinary horse, One Pegasus, performs the course: A beast that traverses the air, More fleet than your Arabian mare: Thus poets get to Hypocrene, Ere Sunday cits to Turnham Green. Phoebus allows the miracle, And so they ride invisible, Indeed the ponies of Parnass, All other quadrupedes surpass; The reason's evident, the mead Is consecrated where they feed: The best historians alledge, There's something holy, in each hedge: CÃ¦lestial herbage blooms around, And not a thistle's in the ground: A nettle here and there you find, For steeds that are to wit inclin'd: Even then, there's honey round the sting, But for a weed there's no such thing. In vain yon look for winter here, 'Tis June, rich June, throughout the year: And hence 'tis said, the coursers' noses, Are perfum'd with parnassian posies; For, as the creatures stoop to graze, They bite and fill the mouth with bays: The fillies chiefly choose to eat The primrose, pagle, violet, Because this sort of food, it seems, Inspires your pretty past'ral themes: On jemmy, gentle feet they run, And frisk, and frolic in the sun: In short, the fields, are here so fine, There's not a doubt but they're divine, Such too, is their peculiar force, A bard they dubb, ass, man, or horse: Certain, as wings grace Hermes' cap, Whoever eats and takes a nap, Right good sufficient poets wake; The better, if their thirst they slake At Caballine the horses fountain; Which lies on t'other side the mountain; Some fearful fools, too tame to blunder, Have set these objects, far asunder, The river in Beotia placing, And Phocis call the spot they graze in, But poet real, mule or man, Spurns at the critic's rigid plan: And skips through kingdoms in a minute, Think of a placeâwhewâpassâhe's in it: Your bards dramatical, shall run And win the sweepstakes from the sun; In waving of a goose's feather, Shall draw the distant poles together; On wings scarce fledg'd, with ease can fly From Catharine street, to Castaly: Then drop on fancy's neck the rein, Dine in the Strand, and sup in Spain. These points premis'd, we will not fail, To see who went to tell the tale, Trust me, there was no less than seven, Now made a vig'rous push for heaven: Dan Roscius rang'd them in a row; And every one desired to go: Their coursers you'll suppose were there, Pawing, to gallop through the air: Reader you'll note, that heaven's a phrase, We, authors, use in different ways, The skies above, lay constant claim, With Helicon to that blest name: Nay what will startle most I know, We give it to the shades below: In short sirs, every place of rest, Is heaven, because it suits us best; So, whatsoever's bad or bitter, Is hell, to make our sense compleater, This licence, chiefly marks our charter, So wonder not, at what comes a'ter; In rhime like this, the bard's allow'd A privilege deny'd the crowd; A letter we ne'er mind a pin, But cast it out or keep it in, Odd syllables we cut and clip, And half a word with ease o'erskip; So, that at top we put our dashes, The critic heeds not, such small slashes: This right did Butler first ordain, And Swift confirm'd the act again: Dan Prior sign'd it with his hand, And spread the licence through the land; Since these so often par'd the line, There's none will cavil sure, at mine: Say, I clip oft'ner, I'm the less; So to return e're I digress. The four first candidates were such, Who writing little, write too much, Your men of Farce and Interlude; Who vex the town with trifles crude; Who with their tiny pop-guns play, And pelt the folly of the day: Slaves whom the manager employs, To keep the galleries from noise. When tragic heroines, in disguise, Are now no more to cheat the eyes: When she, who lately seem'd a brother, In scene the next, turns out a mother: When passions are no more at strife, And the poor cuckold owns his wife: Till she puts on her woman weeds, 'Tis certain that a pause succeeds, And, as it takes both time and pain To make a boy a girl again; 'Tis decent,âpoets use finesse, That each fair lady may undress; Hence Rosius, being politic, Engages those same sons of trick; A tribe of low dramatic hacks, To fill the space, between the acts. Their sense and taste, were nearly even, But all unfit, alas, for heaven. On these accounts he call'd a crony, Who kept a very pretty poney: A thing of fashion, brisk, and neat, And swift of foot, altho' petite: Well he maintain'd a poet's cause, A stickler stout, for critic laws: The steed was little but not lazy, The rider dapper as a daisy. With fairy step, together, they, Had tripp'd to Paris for a play; Thither, each year, the pair would prance, To catch the comedy of France. Him, Roscius, deem'd a proper bard, To carry off the message-card: âThen mount, dear George, said he, your steed And hither come again with speed.â Altho' our poet did not race, He deftly went a decent pace: And those who take long journeys, know Your even riders, fastest go; Thus, though he did not stretch and tear; He canter'd regularly there. For, though a dramatist and fleet, His Pegasus, obey'd the bit. Some bards, full cautious and exact, Are sway'd by Aristotle's act, Which doth provide in certain cases, Strict laws concerning times and places: To break through which, without just reason, Is deem'd a literary treason: And those who, with these laws comply, Must reverence probability. Restricted by the sage's plan, Steadily went our little man: At length arriv'd, he hail'd the spring, Dismounted, and address'd the ring: For as it chanc'd, the ladies nine, Were, after dinner, quaffing wine: A basket of ambrosia by, Remain'd to tempt the stranger's eye; Yet ere he laid a finger on, He told them what he came upon. âYe ever-honour'd three times three, I Coley George, now visit ye, Alas, the messenger of news, That needs must shock each gentle muse: The facts connected with the matter, Will turn your nectar into water: And your divine poetic lake, An ordinary puddle make. Roscius, old Drury's mighty king, (With pain, ye maids, I tell the thing.) Roscius, resolv'd to leave the town, Prepares to quit the scenic crown: Even now he flies, he's gone this hour, Unless you interpose your power.ââ âAnd who the diadem shall wear?â Cried the sad Muses in despair; All rose confus'd, some swore 'twas fable; And spilt their nectar on the table: The tragic Lady tore her hair, Ma'am Comedy began to swear: The Graces, who were then their guests, With great good breeding thump'd their breasts: And though, perhaps, it was but art, So well each fair one play'd her part; They topt it, Reader, as they'd been Training a summer for the scene: I'm led to judge it a deceit, (A pretty modish counterfeit) Because, tho' some amongst them, had Sufficient reason to run mad; Tho' poor Thalia, well might cry, And her sad sister, sob and sigh: Yet really all the rest might spare, Their woeful looks, and sullen air. For those to whimperâ'twas a whim, He scarce knew them, they scarce knew him: For wherefore could the charming Graces, Distort, and spoil their lovely faces? The thing, then as it seems to me, Is, that they wept for sympathy: For, if you criticise, you shall Observe, that Grief's electrical; When Belvidera, draws the tear, Beholdâthe handkerchiefs appear, At once, a thousand noses blow, In sympathising strains of woe: But markâWe don't conclude from hence, And feel the pathos of the sense: Or all regard the stage, or player, Ev'n though the lovely Barry's there; For, those who truly are distrest, The nose shall blow, perhaps the least; Nor is each tender heart alike, And one woe cannot all folks strike: Where fathers feel themselves a Lear, No doubt the misery's sincere: But she who shall be bride to-morrow, May weep for joy, but not for sorrow; And many a tittering fair you find, So little of the weeping kind, Ev'n Shakespeare's scenes could never melt, Tho' still, you'd swear, they really felt: When tender people round you cry; 'Tis right to bear them company, The fan before the face to pull, And vow, 'tis passing pitiful: The eye to rub, the head to lean, And seemâquite soften'd by the scene. This clears the conduct of each Muse, Nor could the Graces well refuse, When Mel. and Tha. heav'd sighs by dozens, To give the sympathy of cousins; Their beauteous sisters too gave vent: Sniveling by way of compliment. Some thought the news must be a fable, Roscius, they said, though old was able The courier must mistake the thing, They'd send an herald to the king, And have it well confirm'd, for sure, The tidings must be premature. The courier said, he told the truth, Moreover, that a tuneful youth, Who, by a certain Spanish plot, A wond'rous rich Duenna got, That he, the palace, now had bought, The trappings, trimmings, and what not: That other gentlefolks had part, And shar'd the instruments of art: The comic mask, the tragic train, The sun shine, and the showers of rain; The weeds the witches often danc'd in, With colour'd coat of Harlequin. The sceptres, swords, and suits of mail, The palace flats, the park, the jail; The dragons, bears, and dromedaries, And all the Pantomime vagaries: The truncheon, targe, and trumpet loud, The paste-board crown, and canvass cloud: The thunder-spouts, and thunder too, With robes, of Tartar, Turk, and Jew: The couches, coronets, and camps, The stars, the moon, and all the lamps: The heroes habits, whole, and torn, And ermine, walking dukes, have worn: The blazing petticoats, and sacks, Which often grac'd princesses backs: In short, the whole machinery, And all the trick of tragedy. Enough, enough, said Pommy, here, I see the horrid matter clear, It chiefly touches you and me. It does my dear Melpomene, Exclaim'd poor Thalyâlet us fly With speed, to feather'd Mercury! This said, the sisters, instant went To Maia in the firmament: Their golden pinions beat the wind, The little herald stay'd behind; Long'd with the rest to hold converse, But thought it right to talk in verse. The bard, a Connisseur, they found, And many a civil thing went round, So after much dramatic chat, They stuck a laurel in his hat: Then, as the nectar 'gan to rise (Which they get constant from the skies; For, from Olympus to Parnass, With them it is an easy pass) Each lady, freely spoke her mind, And didâwhat by, and by, you'll find. Reader, 'twould sacriligious look, At the mere fag end of a book, The sacred matters to rehearse, Which figure in our future verse: When great affairs approach, we pause, This is amongst our epic laws: Important points demand parade. And to grace these we Cantos made. END OF THE SECOND CANTO. CANTO III. Upon a Card, as white as snow, Fairer than message cards below; Fairer than those, on which the belle, Sends, by her Hermes, to Pall Mall The modish message of the day, To form the party for the play, Or fix the hour of dear quadrille, That life's gay wheel may ne'er stand still: The Muses sign'd a soft address, Which Colman, carried off express. THE MUSES TO ROSCIUS. While Mel. and Tha. are gone to heaven, We, your admirers, sisters seven, Send this, to beg you may not sell, Till he who buys, can act as well; When such a bidder you can find, We'll bear to hear, that you've resign'd; Consent, we have a right to claim; Obey, and trust us with your fame; From each, a compliment receive, And kiss the wreathe the Muses weave. I Clio, in th' immortal page, Will bid you live thro' every age; And I, Calliope the fair, Will make your harmony my care; Your dulcet powers of voice record, And tell the music of each word. Erato and Terpsichore, Will guard your dance and poetry, Ours be the office to rehearse Your turn for epilogue, so terse: Our Phoebus scorns the epigram. And blazons only epic fame; The gentle sallies of a morning, His godship trusts, to our adorning: Euterpe, though you seldom sing, Pays you the honours of a king: I, Polyhymn your memory love, Urane, historian above, Upon a sunbeam, writes your name, And Garrick consecrates to fame: While we, the sister Graces, vow, To celebrate your air and bow. Given at our court, Parnassus mountain, By usâPrincesses of the fountain: By us, your friends, the Muses seven, While t'other two are gone to heaven. Our poet now, his hobby strode, And briskly took the London road: But, ere he came to Drury Lane, Thalia, press'd the Olympian plain, For, as no turnpikes tax the air, The sisters presently were there; On earth we often go on gravel, But all on down in heav'n, they travel; The path is cut thro' Ã¦ther clear, A mild and milky atmosphere: And, as you reach the realms of day, There's not a pebble in the way: When once you get beyond the sun, So wondrous rapidly you run, You'd think, so smooth it is and even, You mov'd on feather beds to heaven. Hence Venus, with a thousand Loves, Yokes but a single pair of doves, Which, manag'd, with a silken rein, Skim up and down the rich domain: Cupid, to fly beside her chooses: Juno a brace of Peacocks uses: And as 'tis all an easy flight, Their chariots are exceeding light. Mercurius, summon'd by the Muse, Flew to Elisium with the news, And lighting on the poets' walk, The circle found, in various talk. Shakespeare, majestic in his mien, Superior to the rest was seen, âHyperion's curls, the front of Jove, An eye like Mars,â the lip of Love, Mark'd him, from all the lofty band: A deathless laurel in his hand, A wreath by all the Muses wove, Where each, in rival emblems strove; A tribe of Grecians view'd his grace, With all the Romans of the place; The fathers of th' Athenian stage, Poets sublime, of every age: Virgil, stood gazing on his face, âThe characters of Truth to trace;â Sagacious Plato with surprize, Saw inspiration in his eyes; The piercing Sophocles was struck, At glory beaming in his look; Cold Aristotle, bent the knees, Asham'd to own his unities; Homer himself, to sight restor'd, Embrac'd him, as an equal lord; Apolloâwho that day was there, Proclaim'd the bard his favourite care. Johnson was near, in learned state, Severe in look, of step sedate, Chill erudition in his air, With all an anxious scolar's care: Beaumont and Fletcher.The tuneful twins together sat, Still brother-bards, in friendly chat; Thomson, on beds of roses laid, Was twisting chaplets in the shade; His harp to heavenly subjects strung, Spoke the bold hand of solemn Young; The gentle Otway press'd the green, Still sovereign of the tender scene, An angel audience, own'd his sway, From polish'd Rowe, to pleasing Gay; Milton, whom all with reverence view, Possest the scenes that once he drew; Known by his gait, and sounding lyre, Poor Lee was there, with eyes on fire, Hurrying he went, from grove to grove, And ranted rage, or sung of love. Another part, adorn'd with bowers, Contain'd Thalia's lively powers; Horace, appear'd as king of wit, And Swift maintain'd a regal seat: Of play-house bards, a numerous train, Were still disputing who should reign: The brilliant stroke, the satire smart, The keen retort, around they dart: Even here, they seem'd to hate a brother, And tore the laurel from each other. Old Wycherly assum'd the head, But mighty Dryden took the lead: Whene'er the wond'rous poet sung, All Paradise responsive rung: Ev'n Phillip's godlike son, to hear, Would list'ning, lean upon his spear, And sooth'd by sound, even yet, was vain, Then sigh'd to have his ode again. Who in his life-time absurdly affected to despise a literary reputation. Congreve now thought it no disgrace, But wore a smile upon his face, And yet, I've heard, would now and then, Say civil things to Mrs. Behn. The bard could ne'er his forte forget, But lov'd to joke about it, yet: The courtly Vanburgh too, was near, Whisp'ring in laurell'd Cibber's ear; With many a merry bard beside, Thalia's honour, boast, and pride. Sir Mercury, now spoke aloud, (But settled first his wings, and bow'd) His message told, with godlike grace, And beg'd their judgment on the case: He added too, that Mrs. Tha. Had not once smil'd since dawning day, That Madam Mel. was still in tears, And might be so, these twenty years, Unless their poetships, could rule Friend Roscius, still to play the fool: He thought that Roscius should agree, For sake of all stage poesy, To act one more theatric sessionâ âHermes you're rightâI say, possession;â Cried Shakespeare loud (and while he spoke, No other bard the accents broke) âIs all to perish then of mine, âMust Shkespeare be no more divine? âTho' Fame may here her clarion blow, âPray who must manage it below?â The excellence of Mrs. Siddons, a genius in strong competition with that of Mr. Garrick, was not then known to the stage. He said;âElysium heard the sound, And all its tenants throng'd around: The story in a moment flew, Till every bard the matter knew, One told the tidings to another, Till Sol himself was in a pother. Elysium, reader, is a name, Not only, for these sons of fame, But, a fine place, by Jove ordain'd, For all, who've figur'd, fought, or reign'd: 'Tis for the wise, the great, the fair, And every constant lover's there: It is, in short, for all the good, When they have done with flesh and blood; And yet, the beauty, when a ghost, As once on earth, remains a toast; Th' Elysians, to her charms pay court, And amorous shadows round her sport: The human shape, we sure retain, Else, could sons know their sires again? Now, strange as this may seem to you, Ãneas, found it vastly true, Who (as Dan Virgil's legends shew) Took, once, a pious trip below; Walk'd round the heav'nly garden twice, And own'd Anchises in a trice; Made, without toil, th' important tour, And got to earth within the hour. The characters that Roscius play'd, Were next assembledâto a shade. Poor Benedict, began to stare: And tho' 'tis odd how he got there Macbeth, protested he was glad, Roscius, too oft had made him mad, His crimes so painted to the life, Asâ And now, with equal power, Mrs. Siddons. Pritchard, us'd to paint his wife: The pensive Hamlet, smote his breast, And on poor Yorrick's shoulder press'd: Even Drugger, seem'd to feel the blow, But took a quid to ease his woe: Othello, little seem'd to care, And Jaffier, was not in despair: Yet Royal Lear, sustain'd the stroke, Tho' Barry,âat the bottom broke: Zanga.An hero of the Moorish race, Had a The late Mr. Mossop. new guest in his embrace: Even A name given to Coriolianus, whose character was finely represented by Mr. Mossop. Caiius Marcius, hail'd his friend, And Pierre, was eager to attend; Cato, to grieve, saw little cause; Sheridan gives his senate laws; But princely John, declin'd the head, And wish'd, that Sheridan was dead, Then dropt a tear, and hid his face, As conscious still of his disgrace; Ranger, with nectar almost mellow, Swore Roscius was a pleasant fellow, Then turning to unfriended Amongst the best perform'd parts of Mr. Shuter. Stephen, Wish'd Ned and Davy both in heaven. The multitude now talk'd so fast, The matter was so like to last; So little hope remain'd of hearing, Sir Hermes, spread his wings for steering: When Shakespeare, thus preferr'd a prayer, To him who darts his rays from far. âI feel, I feel the tempest brewing, Dark o'er my stage impends the ruin. Let me to earth a ramble take, And I will expedition make; Thou bearer of the brilliant bow, This favour on thy bard bestow.â Dear Shakespeare, thy request is odd, Replied the silver-shafted god, And yet I know not to denyâ Then here, good friend, said Mercury, This winged cap I'll lend to thee, A flying foot will do for me: So short the way is to the king, One might flit there with half a wing. Consent thus gain'd, and full in feather, The bard and Hermes, flew together. As friendly towards earth they went, To learn what these strange tidings meant, They freely chatted on the road, And Shakespeare thus bespoke the god. Hermes, no toil that man engages; Not making verses to make pages; Not all the logic of the laws, Nor knot, that ties the gordian cause; Not all the navigator's art, Nor even the warrior's wily part; Not methodistical devotion, Nor secret of perpetual motion; Not the dull road to classic knowledge, Nor hum-drum labours of a college; Not the fierce spirit of debate, That works the whirligig of state; Nor jarring jargon of physician, Not science of geometrician; Not fluctions, fractions, or finance, Not both on heel and head to dance; Not Coptic, Algebra, or Erse, Not dignity without a purse; Nor ought on earth such talents ask, Such powers, as the theatric task; At once, to move and mend the heart, A master of the Thespian art; For even I, with all my boast, Was deem'd unfit to make a ghost; Yet Hermes, I could scribble things, As easy, as you work your wings; Could very decent dukes create, And make a minister of state; Dubb one a lord, a second sir, And half complete a character, Sooner than get that phantom's talk, Or e'en be perfect in my stalk: It is not acting, to rehearse, Some hundred lines of florid verse; It is not comedy, to frisk, To trip, to titter, and look brisk; The wood and wire, can dance and caper, A very mountebank can vapour. It is not tragedy, to roar, And flounce the body on the floor; Then to spring upward with a bound, And cast the goggling eyeballs round; To writhe the joints, or shake the head, Then quiver, and burlesque the dead; It is not tragedy, to pout, Or, in a fume to jump about; To slap the forehead, thump the chest, And screw the face to seem distrest; Nor sweat an hour upon the stage, Or twich the mantle in a rage, Hence I infer, my worthy friend, Nature peculiar gifts must lend; And after all her favours, Care, And Industry, must make the player.â Quoth Mercury, âmy noble poet, You're a great man, and often shew it; But now you miss the matter quite: Since you, dear Will, began to write, Affairs have had a modern turn, Actors have little now to learn, The duce a difficulty in it, The hocus-pocus of a minute; For now the folks who teach to speak, Dispatch a dozen in a week. Roscius indeed, and three or four, (Haply thro' Britain half a score) The subject, make a serious science; The rest, to study bid defiance. Who now is to the stage inclin'd, Tells to Sir Manager his mind; âTo be, or not to beâ rehearses, And tries his compass in the curses; His bosom beats with tragic rage, And so he jumps upon the stage: Tho' scarcely half made up he's hurl'd Into this strange and breathing world; Since he must get the words by heart, A time he takes to con his part, Then at the glass an hour employs, And scares the landlady with noise; Then, all in rubric capitals, Resplendent flames along the walls: At every corner of the street, The new young gentleman, you meet; And that he may the better bellow, Sometimes he chooses your Othello; Changes his face to Moorish black, Or else, a bunch upon his backâ He aims at grin, and glare, and posture, And takes a tug at Master Gloster: At length, upon a solemn night, The hero, is to fume, and fight; In Romish triumph, lo! he comes, And stalks, to the tattoo of drums; He never play'd the king, before, O may he never play it more! Observe him the succeeding eve, With a vile livery on his sleeve: Sunk to the servant's lowest place, Yet mean enough to bear disgrace. But if his lungs the task sustain, He plays the character again; The strange attraction casts around, And works his way by dint of sound: The papers circulate the puff, He is a diamond in the rough; And by the force of mighty jaws, He storms the castle of applause; Now with success quite feverish grown, He'll have a playhouse of his own; The manager and actor join, And then he fills the hero's line; Afar he travels on the hoof: His theatre without a roof: In a vile barn, he butchers Lear, And stabbs in booths, the noble Pierre: But ev'n if all his toils succeed, Prithee, dear William, mark the meed: Full oft he bustles all the night, Yet scarcely gets a supper by't; On thy fine thoughts he feeds by day, The famish'd sovereignâof a play; The vagrant hut, rewards his pains, And the world frowns upon his gains: Not pedlar, gipsey, jesuit, Not ballad-wenches, in the street; Not base buffoon on scaffolding; Not bullock baited at the ring; Nor beggar dieting at door; Nor the chance children of the poor; A lot so hardââI prithee stop; Return'd the bardâthe subject drop, For if their private life be good, Blest they may be, whate'er their food. âThe ship boy on the giddy mast,ââ My worthy Billy, not so fast, Said Maia's sonâPhilosophy Is a fine thing, when plenty's nigh; As to their goodness, I profess, They are the types of holiness; Tho' often passing to and fro, I hear no trips, where'er I go; So much to deal in sentiment, Inspires pure love, esteem, content, Tho' grocers will their figs neglect, Actors, will noble thoughts respect; And hence it is, the real player, Will live on virtue and the air: To no one ill is he inclin'd, Unspotted both in form and mind. To do the ladies right, their dress, E'en in a morn, is cleanliness, So spruce, you at a glance would swear, In every pin you saw the player: With rumpled cap, and towzled head, They never breakfast on the bed, But, as at night, they love parade, At day, each fair shall match a maid. Here Hermes paus'd, and wink'd his eye, Wherefore, friend Mercury, so sly, Rejoin'd the poetâin these days, Actors, I hear, get pence, and praise; Fashion it seems, hath chang'd her plan, Town-player, is a gentleman. And surely men of art and sense, Have justly to the name pretence; But, soft I scent the city smoak, So prithee, Hermes, spare thy joke, And if thou lov'st me, quickly say, Should Roscius go, who's left to play? For, since I've been a ghost, my friend, I little to such points attend. 'Tis long, quoth Hermes, Sir, since I, To either house, have had a fly; There's little call for you or me. The news you'll hear from Pomine: For, ah dear Will, a-lack a day! 'Tis all to sing, and nought to say! Opera, my friend, that mongril elf, Has thrown your Lordship on the shelf: In vain you growl forth, list, oh, list, Your favourite phantom is not mist; And when the mob resign their ghost, Judge how much footing you have lost: Uncall'd, old Barry limps about, Gets a long sabbath for his gout; And 'tis with much ado, I hear, His wife can draw one tragic tear: Methinks the age is operatiz'd: Sweet Willyâyou seem much surpriz'd; Hermes stopt shortâthe poet frown'd, And tore the bays his temples bound; The chaplet thrice, indignant, shook; Tost it in air, then angry spoke: âRoscius resign'd! why had he stay'd, I would rush forward, to upbraidâ Oh had I known, what Shakespeare wrote Would fly before the Eunuch's note, By yonderâbut I will not swear, Why didst thou lead me on so far? Hermes your handâdear friend, adieu.â He turn'd about, and backward flew. The God of errands, left alone, Now bent his course towards Helicon. Told every Muse th' appeal was vain, And, in a huff, sought heaven again. THE END. POEMS FROM THE ANNUAL REGISTER. THE PARTRIDGES: AN ELEGY. WRITTEN ON THE LAST DAY OF AUGUST. Hard by yon copse, that skirts the flowery vale, As late I walk'd to taste th' evening breeze, A plaintive murmur mingled in the gale, And notes of sorrow echo'd thro' the trees. Touch'd by the pensive sound, I nearer drew: But my rude steps increas'd the cause of pain: Soon o'er my head the whirling Partridge flew Alarm'd; and with her flew an infant train. But short the excursion;âfor unus'd to play, Feebly th' unfledg'd wings th' essay could make; The parent, shelter'd by the closing day, Lodg'd her lov'd covey in a neigh'bring brake. Her cradling pinions there she amply spread, And hush'd th' affrighted family to rest; But still the late alarm suggested dread, As closer to their feathery friend they prest. She, wretched parent, doom'd to various woe, Felt all a mother's hope, a mother's fear, With grief foresaw the dawn's impending blow; And to avert it, thus prefer'd her prayer: O thou! who even the sparrow dost befriend, Whose providence protects the harmless wren; Thou God of birds! these innocents defend From the vile sports of unrelenting men. For soon as dawn shall dapple yonder skies, The slaught'ring gunner, with the tube of fate, While the dire dog the faithless stubble tries, Shall persecute our tribe with annual hate. O may the sun, unfann'd by cooling gale, Parch with unwonted heat th' undewy ground; So shall the pointer's wonted cunning fail, So shall the sportsman leave my babes unfound. Then may I fearless guide them to the mead, Then may I see with joy their plumage grow, Then may I see (fond thought!) their future breed, And every transport of a parent know. But if some victim must endure the dart, And fate marks out that victim from my race, Strike, strike the leaden vengeance thro' this heart, Spare, spare my babes, and I the death embrace. TO AN INFANT, SLEEPING IN THE ARMS OF ITS MOTHER. Encanting smiler, gentle be thy rest; The softest pillow is thy parent's breast: There mayst thou sleep secure from all alarms, There find life's calmest cradle in her arms; Thereâwhilst the world tumultuous raves around, While Pride and Meanness right and wrong confound, While blust'ring passions half mankind deform, Soft mayst thou lie unconscious of the storm. And, Oh! sweet cherub, happy is thy state, Beyond the strange reverse of future fate: Too soon, alas! thy pleasures will be o'er, Too soon what pleases now, will please no more; Nought equal to the present wilt thou know, For pains and miseries strengthen as we grow. Trouble on troubles croud each rising year. Heave the sad bosom and extort the tear. Soon will th' amusements of thy childhood fly, And other trifles court thy wondering eyeâ Ah then, dear babe, enjoy the happiest hour That Youth and Fortune put within thy power. Thy heaviest sorrows, now soon find relief, Transient thy tears, and transient is thy grief. But soon as trusted from thy mother's arm, Soon as the toy and rattle lose their charm, When reason dawns upon thy opening mind, Then wilt thou see the fate of woman kind: Passions will rise and strengthen with thy age, And fools in every shape thy heart engage; The flutt'ring fop thy vanity address, This moment compliment, the next caress: The cautious traitor will thy glass attend, And herds of coxcombs round thy toilet bend: When lovers praise the light'ning of thine eye, Then, then bewareâsuspect a serpent nigh: With prudence hear the pretty things they say, Nor rashly throw thy happiness away. Oft, ere you change a modest maiden life, Maturely weigh the business of a wife; Better, far better, you should live unwed, Than lead a fool or villain to thy bed. Perpetual curses wait divided hearts; Love, mutual love, the mutual bliss imparts: And, Oh! what agony attends the wife, Who drags her being through continual strife! Condemn'd to bathe the wretched couch with tears, To fret, and tremble, with a thousand fears! Condemn'd, unthank'd, for many a year to drudge And dread a husband, as thieves dread a judge; A prey to every matrimonial care, Even till she begs for death to ease despair! But heaven, on thee soft innocent bestow A lighter burthen of terrestial woe; May Fortune look more smiling on thy youth, And Sense endear to thee the paths of Truth; Then shalt thou well repay a mother's care, And of thy sex be fairest of the fair. Sweet state of childhood, unallay'd by woe, The truest period of our bliss below: Nature presides the guardian of the scene, And all is gentle, genuine, and serene. Soon as we leave the soft maternal breast, 'Tis a struggling warfare at the best: Farewel, a long farewel to peace of mind, For woes on woes unnumbered croud behind. Thus the kind mother of the plumy brood, When first she brings her infants to the wood, Warms them assiduous, with her shelt'ring breast, And lines with whitest wool her downy nest; Outspreads her pinions to their utmost stretch, And curtains round each leaf within her reach; But soon as trusted to the dangerous sky, And for themselves to shift they rashly try, Full many a peril in their way they meet, Full often languish for their lost retreat; The snare or school-boy every joy invade, The parent dies, and saddens all the shade. EXTRACTED FROM VERSES, SENT TO A LADY ON HER BIRTH-DAY. In the gay season of ingenuous youth, While inborn honour points the road to Truth. While the pure soul in search of science flies, And the first hopes are to be lov'd and wise; Oh! may each fragrance of Life's spring be thine, And the rich harvest of content divine; A taste superior, the sublime of mind, All softer feelings, delicate as kind; Passions obedient to the laws of Sense, And all the transports of Benevolence. But when the blessings of thy morn decay, And thou shalt reach the noon of human day; May sober Reason guide thy gentle heart; Still to perform with grace th' important part; The modest miniatures shall lisp thy worth, And often help their sire to bless thy birth. At last, when age exterior bloom decays, And in thy forehead Time his track displays; When heaven with envy views thy husband's state, And courts thy spirit to a nobler fate, When Health's ripe roses on thy cheeks shall die, And Sickness cloud the Summer in thine eye. May sacred Virtue soothe thy christian mind, Calm in decay, and vigorous though refin'd; Clear to their ebb may all thy pleasures flow, And smile like evening sun-beams as they go; Then late, long honour'd, may thy spirit fly, And angels hail its welcome to the sky. POETICAL PIECES FROM LIBERAL OPINIONS. ELEGY OF A NIGHTINGALE, SUPPOSED TO BE WRITTEN BY HERSELF. I For Elusino lost, renew the strain, Pour the sad note upon the ev'ning gale; And as the length'ning shades usurp the plain, The silent moon shall listen to the tale. II Sore was the time, ill-fated was the hour, The thicket shook with many an omen dire! When from the topmost twig of yonder bower, I saw my husband, flutter and expire. III 'Twas when the peasant sought his twilight rest, Beneath the brow of yonder breezy hill; 'Twas when the plumy nation sought the nest, And all, but such as lov'd the night, were still, IV That, fondly sitting with a lover's pride, (My tender custom while the sun withdrew) Dear Elusino, sudden left my side, And the curs'd form of man appear'd in view. V For sport, the tube he levell'd at our head, And, curious to behold more near my race, Low in the copse the artful robber laid, Explor'd our haunt, and thunder'd at the place. VI Ingrateful wretch, he was our shepherd's son, The harmless, good old tenant of yon cot! That shepherd would not such a deed have done; For love of him first fix'd us to this spot. VII Oft' as at eve his homeward steps he bent, When the laborious task of day was o'er, Our mellowed warblings sooth'd him as he went, 'Till the charm'd hind forgot that he was poor. VIII Ah, could not this thy gratitude inspire? Could not our gentle visitations please? Could not the blameless lessons of thy sire Thy barb'rous hand restrain from crimes like these? IX Oh cruel boy, thou tyrant of the plain! Could'st thou but see the sorrows thou hast made, O didst thou know the virtues thou hast slain, And view the gloomy horrors of the shade: X Couldst thou, behold, my infant younglings lie, In the moss'd cradle by our bills prepar'd, Babes as they were, unable yet to fly, Their wings defenceless, and their bosoms bar'd; XI Surely, the mighty malice of thy kind, Thy power to wrong, and readiness to kill; In common pity to the parent's mind, Would cease the new-made father's blood to spill. XII Haply, the time may come, when heav'n shall give To thee the troubles thou hast heap'd on me. Haply, ere well thy babes begin to live, Death shall present the dart of misery. XIII Just as the tender hope begins to rise, As the fond mother hugs her darling boy; As the big rapture trembles in the eyes, And the breast throbs with all a parent's joy; XIV Then may some midnight robber, skill'd in guile, Resolv'd on plunder, and on deeds of death, Thy fairy prospects, tender transports spoil, And to the knife resign thy children's breath. XV In that sad moment shall thy savage heart, Feel the sad anguish, desperate, and wild, Conscience forlorn shall doubly point the smart; And Justice whisper,âThis is child for child. XVI 'Reav'd of their sire, my babes, alas, must sigh; For grief obstructs the anxious widows care; This wasted form, this ever-weeping eye, And the deep note of destitute despair. XVII All load this bosom with a fraught so sore, Scarce can I cater for the daily food! Where'er I search, my husband search'd before, And soon my nest will hold an orphan brood! XVIII For Eleusino, lost, then pour the strain, Waft the sad note on ev'ry ev'ning gale; And as the length'ning shades usurp the plain, The silent moon shall listen to the tale. EPITAPH ON A LAP-DOG. To courts accustom'd yet to cringe asham'd, Of person lovely, as in life unblam'd; Skill'd in those gentle and prevailing arts, Which lead directly to soft female hearts; A kind partaker of the quiet hour, Friend of the parlour, partner of the bow'r, In health, in sickness, ever faithful found, Yet, by no ties, but ties of kindness bound, Of instinct, nature, reason, what you will, For to all duties he was constant still; Such was the being underneath this shrine; Study the character, and make it Thine. ALMERIA; OR, THE PENITENT. An Epistle from an unfortunate Daughter in ?, to her Family in the Country. Withdrawn from all temptations that entice, The frauds of fashion, and the snares of vice, From all that can inspire unchaste delight, To my dear, bleeding family, I write; But oh! my pen the tender task denies; And all the daughter rushes to my eyes. Oft as the paper to my hand I brought, My hand still trembled from the shock of thought: Sighs interrupt the story of my woe, My blushes burn me, and my tears o'erflow; But nature now insists upon her claim, Strikes the fine nerve, and gives me up to shame. No more the anxious wish can I restrain, No longer silent can your child remain; WriteâwriteâI must, my hopes, my fears declare, And try, once more, to win a father's care. Ah! scorn not then, Almeria's mournful verse, Bestow thy blessing, and revoke thy curse; Give to a daughter's wrongs one parent's sigh, Nor thou, my mother, her last prayer deny. Yet where, oh where, shall I the tale begin, Oh! where conclude the narrative of sin? How each dire circumstance of guilt disclose, Unload my breast, and open all its woes? How, to an injur'd parent, shall I tell The arts by which I stray'd, by which I fell? No common language can the scenes express, Where every line should mark extreme distress; Rotine of words, unequal all, we find To paint the feelings of a wounded mind: 'Tis not the scribbler's vein, the songster's art, Nor the wild genius of a vacant heart, 'Tis not the lines that musically flow To mark the poet's visionary woe; Nor all the frolics of the tuneful tribe, Can such a mighty grief as mine describe. Full oft hath scorpion fancy to my view Imag'd each anguish that a parent knew; At midnight's still and searching hour she came, Glar'd round my bed, and chill'd my soul with shame, Each black idea crouded in my sight, And gloom'd a chaos on the balmy night. âBehold, she said, on the damp bed of earth, Th' unhappy man behold, who gave thee birth; Behold him roll in dust his silver hair, While on each muscle sits intense despair; See how the passions vary in his face, Tear his old frame, and testify disgrace; Retir'd from home, in silence to complain To the pale moon, the veteran tells his pain; Now sinks oppress'd, now sudden starts away, Abhors the night, yet sickens at the day. And see, thou guilty daughter! see, and mourn The whelming grief that waits thy sire's return! Beneath some black'ning yew's sepulchral gloom, Where pensive Sorrow seems to court the tomb, Where tenfold shades repel the light of day, And ghostly footsteps seem to press the way. Bent to the ground by mis'ry, and by years, View thy pale bleeding mother bath'd in tears; Her look disorder'd, and her air all wild, She beats the breast that fed a worthless child; And oh! she criesâ Oh had the fostering milk to poison turn'd, Some ague shiver'd, or some fever burn'd; Had death, cold death, befriended on the morn, In which these eyes beheld a daughter born; Or had th' Eternal, seal'd her eyes in night, Ere she the barrier knew 'twixt wrong and right, Ne'er had these curses then assail'd my headâ Why spring such torments from a lawful bed! Now, melted, soften'd, gentler she complains, Rage ebbs away, the tide of love remains: Then how th' affecting tears each other trace, Down the dear furrows of her matron face; But still the anxious mother brings to light, Scenes of past joy, and innocent delight; Calls to remembrance each infantine bliss, The cradle's rapture, and the baby's kiss; Each throbbing hope, that caught th' embrace sincere, With every joy that rose in every tear; The beauteous prospect brightning every day, The father's fondling, and the mother's play. Yet soon she finds again the sad reverse, Till harrass'd nature sinks beneath its curse; Again more fierceâmore mad she rends her frame, And loudly brands Almeria with her shame!â Here paus'd, and shrunk, the vision from my view, But Conscience colour'd, as the shade withdrew: Pierc'd to the heart, in agony I lay, And, all confusion, rose with rising day, But ah! what hope could morning bring to me, What, but the mournful privilege to see, To view the pleasures which I could not share, And waste the day in solitude and care? The sun more clearly shone on my disgrace, And mark'd more deep the blushes on my face. Then, all enrag'd I curs'd th' abandon'd hour, When honour yielded to the traitor's pow'r, When rash, I scorn'd the angel voice of Truth, In all the mad simplicity of youth: When from a father's arms forlorn I stray'd, And left a mother's tenderness unpaid: While nature, duty, precept, all combin'd To fix obedience on a daughter's mind. Stung at the thought, each vengeance I design'd, And weary'd heaven to desecrate mankind! From room to room distractedly I ran, The scorn of woman, and the dupe of man. Alcanor, curst Alcanor! first I sought (And, as I past, a fatal dagger caught) My fury soon the smiling villain found, Struck at his heart, and triumph'd in the wound: âA ruin'd woman gives th' avenging stroke!ââ He reel'd, he fell, he fainted as I spoke. But soon as human blood began to flow, Soon as it gush'd, obedient to the blow, Soon as the ruddy stream his cheek forsook, And death sat struggling in the changing look, Love, and the woman, all at once return'd; I felt his anguish, and my rashness mourn'd; O'er his pale form I heav'd the bursting sigh, And watch'd the languors of his fading eye, To stop the crimson tide my hair I tore, Kiss'd the deep gash, and wash'd with tears the gore, 'Twas love,â'twas pityâcall it what you will; Where the heart feels,âwe all are women still. But low I bend my knees to pitying heav'n, For his recovery to my prayers was giv'n; He liv'dâto all the rest I was resign'd, And murder rack'd no more my tortur'd mind: He liv'dâbut soon with mean perfidious stealth, Left his pale prey, and rioted in health. Yet think not now arriv'd the days of joy; Alcanor flatter'd only to destroy; Alike to blast my body, and my mind, He robb'd me first, then left me to mankind; Soon from his Janus face the mask he tore, The charm was broke, Almeria pleas'd no more: The dreadful cheat awhile to hide he strove, By poor pretences of a partial love, Awhile disguis'd the surfeits of his heart, And top'd, full well, the warm admirer's part; Till tir'd at last, with labouring to conceal, And feigning transports which he could not feel, He turn'd at once so civilly polite, Whate'er I said, indifference made so right, Such coldness mark'd his manners and his mien, My guiltâmy ruinâat a glance were seen. I now assum'd in vain a chaster part, In vain I struggled with a breaking heart Forlorn, I try'd to purify my stain, Correct my life, and rise, reform'd, again: Pleas'd at the hope, from savage man I flew, And sought protection from each friend I knew; Each friend, at my approach, shrunk back with dread, Hide, hide, they cry'd, thy pestilential head! Then for the meanest servitude I sought, But nice suspicion at my figure caught; Too flaunting was my dress, my air too free, And deep reserve betok'ning mystery; Some frailty rais'd a doubt, where'er I came, And every question flush'd my cheeks with shame; Conscious of guilt, overshadow'd by pretence: 'Twas hard to act the farce of innocence. Oft as I begg'd the servant's lowest place, The treach'rous colour shifted in my face; The fatal secret glow'd in ev'ry look, Trembling I stood, and stammering I spoke. Next, came the views of home into my mind, With each dear friend, and relative behind; Pardon, and pleasure, started to my thought, While hope inspir'd forgiveness of my fault: But soon, too soon, those sweet ideas fled, And left me begging at each door for bread. Yet poor indeed was this support to me, (Ah, had I starv'd on common charity!) Far other woes and insults were in store, My fame was lost, and I could lose no more; Driven to the dreadful precipice of sin, My brain swam round, and hurl'd me headlong in. And now, no pen could picture my distress, 'Twas more, much more than simple wretchedness; Famine, and guilt, and conscience tore my heart, And urg'd me to pursue the wantons part. Take then the truth, and learn, ah, learn my shame: Such my hard fateâI welcom'd all that came. But oh! no transport mingled in my stains, No guilty pleasure ever sooth'd my pains; No vicious hope, indelicately gay, Nor warmer passions lull'd my cares away; The flattering compliment fatigu'd my ear, While half afraid, I half conceal'd a tear: Whole nights I pass'd insensible of bliss, Lost to the loath'd embrace, and odious kiss; Nor wine, nor mirth, the aching heart could fire, Nor could the sprightly music ought inspire; Alive to each reflection that oppress'd, The more I gain'd, the more I was distress'd; Ev'n in the moment of unblest desire, Oft would the wretch complain I wanted fire; Cold as a statue in his arms I lay, Wept thro' the night, and blush'd along the dayâ Ah think what terrors e'er could equal mine! Ah think, and pityâfor I once was thine! The sweet society of friends was o'er, For happier women dare invite no more; And they, at noon, would meet me with alarms, Who stole at midnight to my venal arms. My own companions no sweet comfort brought, A shameful set, incapable of thought; Their wanton passions ne'er could touch my heart, For all was looseness, infamy, and art; No modest maxims suited to improve, No soft sensations of a chaster love, No gen'rous prospects of a soul refin'd, No worthy lessons of a noble mind, E'er touch'd their bosoms, harden'd to their state: Charm'd by their arts, and glorying in their fate; Some stroke of frolic was their constant theme, The dreadful oath, and blasphemy extreme, Th' affected laugh, the rude-retorted lye, Th' indecent question, and the bold reply; Even in their dress, their business I could trace, And broad was stamp'd the Harlot on each face; O'er every part the shameful trade we spy, The step audacious, and the rolling eye: The smile insidious, the look obscene, The air enticing, and the mincing mein. With these, alas! a sacrifice I liv'd; With these the wages of disgrace receiv'd: But heav'n, at length, its vengeance to complete, Drove meâdistemper'dâto the public street. For on a time, when light'ning fir'd the air, And laid the sable breast of midnight bare; When rain and wind assail'd th' unshelter'd head, That sought in vainâthe blessing of a bed; Distress'dâdiseas'dâI crawl'd to every door, And beg'd, with tears, a shelter for the poor! My knees, at length, unable to sustain The force of hunger, and the weight of rain, Fainting I fell, then stagg'ring rose again, And wept, and sigh'd, and hop'd, and rav'd in vain, Then (nor till then) o'erwhelm'd by sore distress, To my own hand I look'd for full redress; All things were aptâno flatterer to beguile, Twas nightâ'twas darkâoccasion seem'd to smile: Where'er I turn'd, destruction rose to view, And, on reflection, rising frenzy grew.â From foolish love, the knife, conceal'd, I wore, Which, in my rage, Alcanor's bosom tore; Thought press'd on thoughtâth' unsettled senses flew, As from my breast the fatal blade I drew; Still the stain'd point with crimson spots was dy'd, âAnd this is wellâ'tis blood for blood,â I cry'd! Then did I poise the instrument in air, Bent to the stroke, and laid my bosom bare: But ah! my crimes that instant rose to view, Disarm'd my purposeâmy resolves o'erthrew; Fear shook my hand, I flung the weapon by, Unfit to liveâI was not fit to die!â Ah! wretched woman, she, who strays for bread, And sells the sacred pleasures of the bed; Condemn'd to shifts, her reason must despise, The scorn and pity of the good and wise; Condemn'd each call of passion to obey, And in despite of nature to be gay; To force a simper, with a throbbing heart, And call to aid the feeble helps of art; Oblig'd to suffer each impure caress, The slave of fancy, and the drudge of dress; Compell'd to suit her temper to each taste, Scorn'd if too wanton, hated if too chaste; Forc'd with the public whimsy to comply, As veers the gale of modern luxury; And oft th' afflicted creature must sustain Strokes more severe, yet tremble to complain: The felon bawd, a dreadful beast of prey, Rules o'er her subjects with despotic sway, Trucks for the human form, with fatal pow'r, And bargains for her beauties by the hour. But should some female in her dang'rous train, Attend the altar of her shame with pain, Dispute at length the monster's base controul, And dare assert the scruples of her soul; Should she reluctant yield to the disgrace, And shew the signs of sorrow in her face, Th' imperious abbess frowns her into vice, And hates the sinner that grows over-nice. But hear, yet hear, your hapless daughter's plea, Some little pity still is due to me. If to have felt each agony of mind, To bear the stings which conscience leaves behind; If at each morn to shudder at the light, Dread the fair day, and fear the coming night; If, like the thief, of ev'ry eye afraid, Anxious I sought the blush-concealing shade; If my sad bosom, bursting with its weight, Bled and bewail'd the hardships of my fate; If to have known no joys, yet known all pains, Can aught avail to purge my former stains, Judge not your child,âyour suppliant,âtoo severe, But veil her frailties, and bestow a tear!â Yet has Almeria now a juster claim To seal her pardon, and to close her shame, Nobler each early trespass to remove, And hope again the sanction of your love. These holy mansions, sacred to our woes, Which screen from scorn, and hide us from our foes; Which the fallen woman gradually retrieve, Reform the manners, and the mind relieve; Which shield from barbarous man his hapless prey; Expunge the spot, and chace the blush away; Sooth every sorrow by the pow'r of pray'r, And half supply a parent's pious care; Which lull the flutt'ring pulses to repose, Each anguish soften, and each wish compose; Wean us from scenes that fatally misguide, And teach the breast to glow with nobler pride: These holy mansions have receiv'd your child, And here she mourns each passion that beguil'd. Thrice has the sun his annual beams bestow'd, And found me here, determin'dâto be good: Already feels my heart a lighter grief, And each white minute brings me fresh relief; Or if by chance my sorrows I renew, Half claim my crimes, and half belong to you; Here then for ever, secret and resign'd, Here for its God will I prepare my mind; Here pass conceal'd, my penitential days, And lead a life of piety and praise. Come then, thou lovely patroness of Fame, Thou bright restorer of a ruin'd name, Come, fair Repentance, o'er each thought preside, Patient I follow such a heav'nly guide; To all thy laws implicitly I bend, And call thee sister, saviour, genius, friend! Oh! let me breathe the solemn vow sincere, Oh! let Religion consecrate each tear! Then, should long life be mercifully giv'n; Again the soul may dare to think of heav'n; Then, cleans'd from every dark and Ethiop stain, Virtue, that dove of peace, shall come again, With smoothest wings re-settle on my breast, And open prospects of eternal rest. And yet, before that golden hour arrive, Ah! would my injur'd relatives forgive! Ah! could they see this happier turn of fate, And view their poor Almeria's chaster state; Then would they fondly close her fading eye, Bless her last breath, and bid her peaceful die. Deep in her ward's most venerable gloom, Late was a contrite sister, from her room, Where long the blushing, pious vot'ress lay, And sought a shelter from the shame of day, In words half-smother'd by the heaving sigh, And voice that spoke despair,âthus heard to cry:â âOh! injur'd Chastity, thou heav'nly dame, Thou spotless guardian of the cherub Fame, Who arm'st fair Virtue 'gainst th' insulting foe, And in her cheeks commands the rose to blow: Had I, oh! had I still thy rules obey'd, Despis'd the treach'rous town, and walk'd the shade; Had I each villain stratagem defy'd, And scorn'd the flatterer with a decent pride; Had I withstood his arrows at my heart, Oppos'd each trick, and baffled ev'ry art, Then lib'ral truth might ev'ry hour employ, Each thought be rapture, and each hope be joy; Then lov'd, rever'd, as mother and as wife, Blest had I been, in the pure vale of life. Haply my EdwardâOh! lamented name, Once my high boast, before I plung'd in shame; Haply my Edward, yielding to my charms, (Oh! my smote bosom, whence these new alarms? Why spring the conscious drops into my eye? Why feels my heart the love-impassion'd sigh?) I dare not speak my promis'd happinessâ Yet, Edward, couldst thou witness my distress, Witness the firm unviolated mind, Seduc'd by vice, but not to vice inclin'd: Couldst thou behold the constant-falling tear, My pray'rs attest, my self-reproaches hear; Ah! couldst thou think how deeply I bewail, How thick enshrowd me in the friendly veil; How, in the sacred solitude of night, The care of heav'n unceasing I invite, Breathe the warm wish, and pour the fervent prayer; Now dare to hope, and now expect despair: Couldst thou but see these changes of my grief, Surely thy pity would bestow relief. My Edward's virtue, (for I know his heart,) The balms of soft compassion would impart, His breast would mitigate each stern decree, And judgment yield to Mercy's milder plea; But he is lostâfond wretch, thy plaint give o'erâ The dear, the injur'd Edward, is no more, Or, if he livesâhe recollects thy shame, Scorns thy false vows, and hates th' unworthy flame.ââ Scarce had the pensive child of Sorrow spoke, When from a neighbouring ward these accent broke: âTis she!â'tis she!âth' unfortunate is found, My pulse beats quickâAh! save me from the ground, Support meâhelp meâsome assistance lend, And my faint footsteps to the mourner bend; She lives!âshe lives!ââThe unhappy woman heard, Shook in each nerve, and trembled at each word, Then swooning sunk at length upon the floor, Just as th' afflicted stranger reach'd the door: Tottering he enter'dâcaught th' afflicted fair, And rais'd her flutt'ring frame, with tend'rest care. Ah drooping lily! rise to life and me, And, in this faded form, thy Edward see; Recall the lustre in the sparkling eye, And bid for ever all thy sorrows fly; Long have I sought thee with a lover's zeal, For thee alone I weep, for thee I feel; Come then, fair penitent, forget each woe, And ev'ry pleasure, ev'ry transport know; Lost be the mem'ry of thy former stain, Thy pow'rful pray'rs have wash'd thee white again; Bury'd be ev'ry anguish in this kiss, Wake then, O wake, to virtue and to bliss!â He said, and press'd her in a soft embrace, While the warm blood sprang flushing to her face, Now pale retir'd, now ran a deeper red, Till cheer'd at last, the sweet disorder fled; A thousand tender questions now succeed, They smile alternate, and alternate bleed. Edward, the chaplain's long-try'd friend had been, And hence arose the late propitious scene; The sacred chaplain gave her to his care, Join'd their kind fates, and left them with a pray'r. SOLILOQUIES OF A HIGHWAYMAN. Ah! family forlorn! The sport of fortune, famine, and mankind; Compose thy griefs, Louisaâstop those tears; Cry not so piteousâspare, oh spare, thy sire, Nor quite distract thy mother,âhapless babes! What shall I do?âwhich ever way I turn, Scenes of incessant horror strike my eye: Bare, barren walls gloom formidably round, And not a ray of hope is left to chear; Sorrowing and sick, the partner of my fate Lies on her bed of straw,âbeside her, sad My children dear, cling to her breast, and weep; Or prest by hunger, hunt each nook for food, And quite exhausted, climb these kneesâin vain. How ev'ry asking eye appeals at once! Ah looks too eloquent!âtoo plainly marked, Ye ask for breadâI have no bread to give. The wants of Nature, frugal as she is, The little calls and comforts which support From day to day the feeble life of man, No more, alas! thy father, can supply!â To me, the hand of heaven-born Charity Hard, as the season, gripesâthe neighbourhood, Busy'd or pleas'd, o'erlook a stanger's woe; Scarce knows the tenant of the adjoining house, What thin partitions shield him from the room Where Poverty hath fix'd her dread abode. Oh fatal force of ill-tim'd delicacy, Which bade me still conceal the want extreme, While yet the decent dress remain'd in store, To visit my Eugenius like myself; Now shame, confusion, memory, unite To drive me from his door.â ? Ah cruel man! Too barbarous Eugeniusâthis from thee? Have I not screen'd thee from a parent's wrath, Shar'd in thy transports, in thy sorrows shar'd? Were not our friendships in the cradle form'd, Gain'd they not strength and firmness as we grew, And dost thou shift with fortune's veering gale? Dost thou survey me with the critic's eye? And shun thy friend, becauseâ(oh blush to truth, Oh stain, to human sensibility!) Because his tatter'd garments to the wind And every passenger, more deep betray Th' extremity severeâthen fare thee well! Quick let me seek my homely shed again, Fly from the wretch, who triumphs o'er my rags, On my Louisa's faithful bosom fall, Hug to my heart my famish'd fondlings round; Together sufferâand together die.â ? What piles of wealth, What loads of riches glitter through each street? How thick the toys of fashon croud the eye! The lap of luxury can hold no more; Fortune, so rapid, rolls the partial show'r, That ev'ry passion sickens with excess, And nauseates the banquet meant to charmâ Yet, what are all these golden scenes to me, These splendid modish superfluities; What are these bright temptations to the poor? Sooner, alas, will Pride new gild her coach, Than bid the warming faggot blaze around The hearth where chill Necessity residesâ But must Louisa, thenâour tender babesâ Must they untimely sink into the grave; Must all be victims to a fate so sore? The world will nothing give but barren frowns: What then remainsâThere stands the wretched hut I dare not enterâHeav'n befriend them all! What then remainsâThe night steals on apace; The sick moon labours thro' the mixing clouds: Yesâthat were wellâO dire Necessity!â It must be soâDespair, do what thou wilt! â I faint with fear, With terror, and fatigueâThis forest gloom, Made gloomier by the deep'ning shades of night, Suits well the sad disorders of my soul: The passing owl shrieks horrible her wail, And conscious broods o'er her prophetic note; Light springs the hare upon the wither'd leaf, The rabbit frolicsâand the guilty mind starts at the sound, as at a giant's treadâ Ah me!âI hear the horse along the roadâ Forgive me, Providenceâforgive me Man! I tremble thro' the heartâThe clatt'ring hoof Re-echoes thro' the woodâthe moon appears And lights me to my preyâ ? Stop traveller! Behold a being born like thee to live, And yet endow'd with fortitude to die, Were his alone the pang of poverty; But a dear wife, now starving far from hence, Nine hapless hungry children at her side, A frowning world, and an ungrateful friend, Urge him to actions which his heart abhors: Assist usâsave usâpity our despair, O'erlook my fault, and view me as a man. A fellow-mortal sues to thee for bread, Invites thy charityâinvites thy heart: Perhaps thou art an husband, and a father; Think if thy babes, like mine, dejected lay And held their little hands to thee for food, What wouldst thou have me do, wer't thou like me, Driven to distress like mineâoh! then befriend, Make our sad cause your ownâI ask no more, Nor will I force what bounty cannot spare: Let me not take assassin-like the boon, Which, humbly bending at thy foot, I beg. Ne'er till this night ? ? God speed thee on thy way May plenty ever sit within thy house! If thou hast children, angels guard thy steps! Health scatter roses round each little cheek, And Heav'n at last reward thy soul with bliss! He's goneâand left his purse within my hand; Thou much-desir'd, thou often sought in vain, Sought while the tears were swimming in my eye, Sought, but not foundâat length I hold thee fast. Swift let me fly upon the wings of love, And bear the blessing to my fainting babes, Then, gently take Louisa in my arms, And to the mourner whisper, happier tidings. â Hark! what noise was that? 'Twas the dull bittern, booming o'er my head; The raven follows herâthe dusky air, Thickens each form upon the cheated sight: Ha! something shot methought across the way, 'Tis but the shadow of this stripling tree, That throws its baby-arms as blows the gale. Each object terrifies Guilt's anxious heart! The robbers trembles at â â What have I said? Robber!âwell may I startâO Heav'n! What have I done? â Shall then Louisa live on spoil? Shall my poor children eat the bread of theft? And have I, at the peaceful hour of night, Like some malignant thing that prowls the wood, Have Iâa very felon!âsought relief By means like these? And yet the traveller Gave what I ask'd, as if in charity: Perhaps his heart compassionately kind, Gave from an impulse it could not resist: Perhapsâ'twas fearâlest murder might ensue: Alas, I bore no armsâno blood, I sought! How knew he that?âyet sure he might perceive The harden'd villain spoke not in my air; Trembling and cold, my hand was join'd in his, My knees shook hard, my feeble accents fail'd, The father'sâhusband'sâtears, bedew'd my face, And virtue almost triumph'd o'er despair! Yet strikes the thought severely on my heart, The deed was foul!âsoftâlet me pause awhile! Again, the moon-beam breaks upon the eye, âGuilt bears me to the groundâI faintâI fall! The means of food should still be honest means, Else were it well to starve!â ODE TO A SCHOOL-FELLOW. Written at Falstead in Essex. I. Hail to the harmless seats of happy youth! To the smooth hours of genuine pleasure, hail! All hail to transportâhail to truth, When health blew fresh in every gale, Life smil'd, and reckless pastime spread the frolic sail!â II. Backwards, dear youthâa little cast thine eye, Let pregnant fancy paint each early scene, And pencil fair our boyish days, The lively hope that crown'd the revel reign: Our thousand pleasuresâthousand plays!â If these thou hast forgotâforbear to sigh: If thou these call'st to mindâOh still bestow thy sympathy. II.Wrongly numbered in the source text. Should be part III. Recall the hour that set us free, From gerunds, pronouns, prosody, Recall the bliss that throbb'd the heart, When the glad summons bade us freely start, 'Twas heaven, and holidayâ And every little soul was dancing in its May! IV. 'Tis true, we dealt in trifles then, But trifles please more mighty men; Cheap were the baby-toys we chose, Blithe as the ruddy morn we rose, And slept at night, withâall a boy's repose. We knew not man's amusements wild, Our wishes were the wishes of a child. V. What tho' (for we are heirs of pain, Even from cradle, sore we sigh, And as the hill of life we gain, More rugged is the roadâmore sharp the misery!) VI. What tho' some vexing troubles rose Our sports to discompose; What tho' the light'ning of the master's eye, The threat'ning tone, the brow austere, Bespoke disaster near, And pedagogal tyranny: Tho' knotty points of learned lore distrest, Puzzled the head, and throbb'd the breast; Tho' the keen scourgeâof dreadful size! Acutely whipt to make us wise; The fleeting grief ne'er reach'd the heart, But the faint cries were transient as the smart. VII. Soon as the passing pain was o'er, Suspended happiness return'd, The passing tear was seen no more. The tyrants sceptre lost its power, For mirth resum'd the vacant hour, And the gay stripling laughs at what he mourn'd before! VIII. The soldier thus, in heat of wars, Sunk by the sudden blow to ground, Still cover'd o'er with various scars, Ere well the anguish leaves the wound, Soon as he gains the strand That girds his native land, With triumph he recounts the hardy fray, Shews the deep mark, where many a bare bone lay; And smiles, and hardy boasts the blood-shed of the day. IX. Can'st thou, my friend, recall these joys, Yet cease to wish we still were boys? Think on the deep complottings of our crew, Scheme under scheme, some arch exploit in view, The merry moon-shine pranks we play'd, The little thefts at evening's fall; The truant rambles we and vet'rous made, When bold we scal'd the orchard wall. X. Where, as we reach the ruddy bough, On which the fair temptations grow, One plucks the golden fruitâand one receives below! Ah miniature exact of man! Nature's full length, is still on childhood's plan, But brighter colours deck the youth, Rapture and health, vivacity and truth, Soft too are then the shades of care, And all is blythe as light, all buxom as the air. TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE PRINCE OF WALES, A POEM. Revised from a Poem, written in the Year 1769, never before published. While bless'd with infant innocence and truth, Those fair attendants of ingenious youth, While yet in embrio each idea lies, And in the soul her opening passions rise; While dawning Reason ripens in her mine, And all the Senses bow at Nature's shrine; Amidst the bounties of superior Wealth, The joys which flow from Fortune and from Health; While crowds obsequious on thy beck attend, And a free people, fraught with incense, bend; While courtly Adulation, false and dear, Pours her delicious poison in thine ear; While servile bards, in mercenary praise, The honied period turn a thousand ways. Surrounded thus by all that can inspire, Bliss, Passion, Pleasure, Frolic, and Desire, O let the free born Muse, with loyal zeal, Boldly declare what flatterers wou'd conceal! Smit with the splendor of the shining ore, The flame of Fashion, and the awe of Power, The thund'ring title, the imperial sway, The regal ornament, the venal lay; Seldom the poet dares obey his heart, But makes his fear a pander to his art; Thou noble youth, shoud'st spurn th' harmonious strain, Nor let a Briton strike the lyre in vain. O! in that season, when in Nature's pride The sallying passions rove without a guide, O'er the warm cheek when glows Life's fervid flush, And to the eye the buoyant spirits rush, When thrilling rapture trances all the soul, And joys tumultuous in the bosom roll, Hard is the task to walk in Reason's fence, And keep the fair sobriety of Sense. Man, various, compound of direct extremes, Incongruous in his wakings as his dreams, As strange in that he chooses or rejects, In what he follows, as in what neglects, Fond of new game, yet weary of the chase, Ere he has run, with firmness, half the race; In love with order, living without plan, Now as an angel acting, now as man; Half slave, half victor, piercing, and yet blind, Seraph in form, hermophradite in mind; Now weak as Paris, now as Ajax strong, In love with virtues, yet attach'd to wrong; Passions chief toy, and as they sink or rise, Or great or mean, magnanimous or wise, Now weeping frailty, and now boasting power, Sport of the present, past, and future hour. Thus inconsistent, ah how weak his will, To guard the bosom from pervading ill, Assail'd by Nature, close beset by Art, And ah! too strongly tempted by the heart; Allur'd by titles, by false pleasure charm'd, By Wealth solicited, by Love disarm'd; Ambitions sky-crown'd trophies in the eye, And the foul touch'd with Hope's insidious sigh: How arduous, Sir, to keep the princely mind A temple sacred to the human kind! As varying Pleasure darts her smiles around, And strews her ruddiest rose-buds on the ground, As shines Love's nectar in Youth's flattering glass, And Nature gilds the minutes as they pass. Swift glides the heart from Virtue's fair intent, And faint Denial half implies consent. 'Twixt shame and passion floats the struggling mind, To Virtue now, and now to vice inclin'd, This frowns refusal, that persuades to yield, Till Reason falls, and Passion takes the field, Then guard, oh! noble youth, the sliding heart, Sov'reigns are subjects to the master part; The ruling passion still maintains its post, Monarch o'er monarchs, and the mortal's lost. Had he, who rules supreme th' etherial way, Suffer'd yon golden orb who guides the day, Lawless and free to range the bright expanse, And on the neighb'ring systems wild advance, Verge all at random on some station'd star, A fiery deluge trailing thro' the air; No more its genial radiance would bless, But blast the visual nerves with bright excess: Yet, justly order'd by th' Almighty Power, It kindly darts on man, and beast, and flow'r, Warms into life the vegetative globe, And decks creation in a smiling robe. So Thou, great youth, should Reason quit the helm, Folly invade, or passions overwhelm; Should sycophants suggest the whim to waste, Or Fancy tempt thee to an useless taste; Shouldst thou illustrious Edward's footsteps quit, Or on the rocks of hapless Richard split; Should ere th' unprincely rage of Pow'r enflame, Or Avarice plunge thee in the miser's shame; Should Fashion riot in the realms of Sense, Or Pomp spread forth her vain magnificence; Should Public Phrenzy the fair soul disgrace, And make a kingdom totter on its base; Should Private Madness e'er the man deform, While the pale virtues fly before the storm; Then useless all a promis'd crown has given, Then to dark curses all the boons of Heav'n: But wisely govern'd, wide shalt thou dispense The plenteous tides of rich Benevolence, And like the sun, with universal glow, Rich thro' thy empire shall each blessing flow. But know, each virtue strain'd, becomes a vice, And barriers bound them exquisitely nice; Thin the partitions betwixt good and ill, Outrageous virtues like strong vices kill; As moderate sweets are grateful to the sense, But surfeit in th' extreme, and give offence; As potent odours violate the small, Or Heav'n, should music stun us, would be Hell. Oft in the beating of the liberal breast, To save the sorrowing, and to serve th' opprest; Oft when high feelings touch the regal mind, And stretch the arms of Bounty to mankind; Some start of Fancy, some caprice of Pride, Turns the best purpose of the soul aside; A new Delusion o'er the senses play, And Resolution idly melts away. Oft too, the nobler principles misled, Float with the feather in the Flatterer's head, And each brave impulse of sublimer hearts, Are oft subverted by the Pander's arts. Nature and Fortune mourn an equal cause, For half their fav'rites counteract their laws; With idiot wildness break down Nature's fence, And ravage all the stores of sober sense. The nymph who moves with more than Cyprian grace, By nature blest with more than cherub face, Or proud or peevish, or severely grave, The child of vanity, of prate the slave, Vain or affected, seldom knows the art To touch the senses, or to warm the heart. All froth and flutter, some inconstant things Eternal flap their aromatic wings, Who languish out their lives in silken sighs, Gay, gaudy, giddy, human butterflies. While others, rough and masculine of mind, Whom nature fashion'd of the doubtful kind, By some dear sin each charm of face deform, As Heav'n enwraps the sunshine in the storm. Nor less the sons of Greatness wrong their power, Lost in the luxury of a golden shower, How few the joys of affluence improve, Sunk by false shame, inebriate with love, In each extravagance of mad expence, The whims of Folly, and the whirls of Sense, The circling thousands in profusion fly, To glut th' enthusiast's lazy dignity. Heav'n, when it gives proportions to the end, And without wild profusion, proves a friend, Liberal to all, to none a part denies, Preserves, prevents, accommodates, supplies, And in the scheme of wisdom, 'twas decreed, That those who rule should govern those who need; Not govern only, but with generous care, The partial blessings bountifully share. Thus Wealth its superfluity divides, Thus Power enjoys what Industry provides. Such God's first sov'reign law to subject man; O England's Hope! mayst thou adopt the plan, Let all the social, royal graces move Thy ardent soul to Friendship, and to Love; In thy glad eye be shining Truth express'd, Bright as the star that glitters on thy breast; The various realms of wretchedness explore, And pour Compassion's Balm on every sore; Where private anguish rends the honest heart, Timely apply, blest youth, thy saving art; Where public tumult maddens in thy state, Assert thy virtue, and be truly great; Wipe the warm tear from Penury's sad eye, And chear the spirit labouring with its sigh: Till wide diffus'd thy spreading bounties run, Great, rich, and various as the noon-tide sun; Till future ages with delight may sing, The deathless honour of a patriot King; While ev'ry British bosom beats thy praise, And conscience casts a glory round thy days. EPITAPHS. EPITAPH ON ? What tho' no titles speak thy modest worth, Nor proud processions, nor the pomps of birth; Nor trophied tombs where labour'd emblems shine To mark, in gloomy state, an ancient line Of Kings and heroes crumbling near the spot, Where ev'ry folly but their Pride's forgot? The glare of fortune and the swell of blood, Ill suits the decent grave, that holds the good; Ill suits, oh parent shade! thy humble dust, Which asks no flatt'ry from the breathing bust: Far other power, no marble can impart, Records the hist'ry of a father's heart; Far other incense shall thy ashes grace, Ah dear support and comfort of thy race! Thine the fair homage filial loves supplies, In balmy tribute from thy childrens sighs, The bosom'd shrines that own thy deathless sway, No moth shall perish, and no worm decay; A son's mute grief shall make thy fame more clear, Thy virtues shine more graceful in the tear, That duteous bathes a daughter's cheek, than all The vaunting plumage of the gorgeous pall, And more true honour from such offering springs Than the mock woe which grandeur buys for Kings. TO THE MEMORY OF CAPTAIN DRUMMOND, A BRAVE YOUNG OFFICER. Shall spotless honour, and ingenious truth, The glow of manhood in the bloom of youth, Worth's rosy prime in Nature's earliest morn, Talents to raise, and manners to adorn, In the dark tomb, unwept, unhonour'd lie, No sweet memorial of the grateful sigh, No pensive friend to clasp the modest urn At which the Graces and the Virtues mourn; At which Alluding to his having bravely defended the Pacquet, which was attacked while the Duchess of Devonshire was on beard. fair Devonshire might shed the tear, And twine the laurel round her hero's bier; For 'twas his valour did the treasure save When Albion's brightest gem was on the wave, A gem which Bourbon would exulting see, And ask whole realms to set the captive free. Oh blossom'd promise of thy country's care, Thy country's Muse for thee the wreaths prepare, And Memory notes thee in her faithful page, Pointing thy fame to many a distant age. Long shall th' enduring model be impress'd, In the pure temple of each generous breast, Shrin'd in that precious record shall it shine, And England's youth their virtues form on thine. EPITAPH On a DOG born at Rome, and brought by Lady S?y into England, from thence carried to her Ladyship's Family Seat in Wales, where he died. In soft repose, beneath this Cambrian tomb, Here liesâan ancient citizen of Rome: And that great mistress of the world must own Ne'er did she look upon a worthier son: Not the Twelve CÃ¦sars shew'd a soul more free, Than shone, O venerable sage! in thee. In her proud empire, all her chiefs around, Not a more generous hero could be found. By instinct taught to act a Roman part, Fear trembled to approach thy dauntless heart; No blood of Nero enter'd thy firm breast, Yet bold as godlike Cato when oppress'd; The first Dictator not more mild than thee, Wise as Pompilius, gay as Anthony; With Trajan kind and Pertinax the just, Far from vile Cataline, should sleep thy dust. Ev'n Pompey's generous slave, who gently bore His master's headless body stain'd with gore, Far from the strand to bathe it in the main, When haughty Julius left it on the plain, Not that good freed-man with a heart more brave Than thine, a charge so lov'd, so dear would save. Nor Decius' self, who for his country died, Had more of glowing zeal or patriot pride. Thanks to thy gentle mistress, thou wert brought With all th' imperial, ancient graces fraught, To this blest isle, from the Italian shore, When Rome's primeval glories were no more; As in thy native land thou here might see Reviv'd, reform'd, the Roman Liberty; Here was thy Freedom giv'n on Albion's coast, And three great nations shall thy friendship boast. England thy residence, Rome claims thy birth, Thy ashes rest in Cambria's holy earth; In that unconquer'd soil is rear'd thy shrine, And near thy tomb, th' illustrious S?ys join! Thrice honour'd Roman, 'twas thy happy fate, To live and die amongst the Good and Great. See the Novel of Charles and Charlotte.SILVANA, THE HIGHLAND SHEPHERDESS. 'Twas in December's drear, and darksome days When the cold North sends forth his cutting blast: 'Twas when portentous clouds denoting storm Their sable horrors roll'd around the Heavens: 'Twas when by force of hurricanoes vast, The towering fir e'en to his root was riven, Till all of feather, or of fleece, forsook The Highland hill, to shelter in the vale: Then 'twas, that poor Silvana to her grief A prey, and reckless of the threat'ning sky, Sat on the perilous ridge of the rude rock, That frowns upon the dizy precipice. Lonely she sat, and ne'er did sorrow seize A form more delicate, a soul more kind. Care, from her tender cheek, now woeful wan The rose had torn, and in its stead the tear, Like dew-drops on the lilly, settled there. Five fleecy friends were to Silvana dear, And more than five moons wasted had they fed, On the scant reliques of Silvana's store. The prickly furze, the weed-entangled grass, The thistly blade, the heavy hemlock's leaf, The bitter mallow, and the flowery fern, Her sheep ne'er cropt, but herbs of sweetertaste, The vernal pasturage of voluptuous meads, The richest grazings of the daintiest dell, The velvet verdure of the violet vale, The honied clover, and the fragrant blade. Her daily journey to the fertile farms Was for the purchase of the day's repast; But now her eye was fix'd, her bosom bare, Irregularly throbbing with its woe; Wild to the pitiless winds her scatter'd locks Luxurious floated; half her shoulder spread, And half in deep disorder stream'd in air: Uplift to Heaven her snowy arms were rais'd In passion or in prayer; at last a sigh Heav'd from her hapless heart, and thus she sung. I 'Twill soon be o'erâno more despair, Silvana's eyes shall soon be dry; Man, feeble man, was born to bear, âTo look about him, and to die.â II Then soft a while, and gentle death Silvana's passing-bell shall toll, Her lambs shall catch her wand'ring breath, And Heaven shall watch the flying soul. III This fluttering spirit shall be free, My sheep, meantime, demand my care; They browze, and bound round yonder tree, But ah!âtheir shepherd is not there. IV Yet cease awhileâno more despair, I see my shepherd in the sky; Tho' man's frail race were born to bear, The wedded soul shall never die. BALLAD POEMS FROM EMMA CORBET, AND SONGS. VERSES WRITTEN IN THE MOMENTS OF WAITING AN INTERVIEW. I Tender tremours touch the bosom, As the gentle hour moves by; Expectation, almost weeping, Tip-toe stands in either eye. II Ah! what precious preturbations Haunt the fancy of a friend! Half an hour, of watchful waiting, Seems a period without end. III When the clouds hang dark and heavy, Disappointment o'er me low'rs; But as fairer fleeces favour, Hope bestows her promis'd flow'rs. IV Soon again soft fears assail me, Since the visit is delay'd; Thenâah then!â'tis apprehension, Of a thousand things afraid. V Haply sickness may detain herâ Thus Imagination cries: Haply pain, or haply perilâ Then this bosom bleeding lies. VI Ev'ry step that strikes the pavement, Ev'ry summons at the door; Ev'ry sound of passing coaches, Warm and chill these pulses more. VII Now I dread th' excusing message, Now I dread some dire disease; Too much wind, or too much sunshine, Robs alike this breast of ease. VIII Heav'n must make a morn on purpose, To compose the gentle heart; Zephyr's bland must fan the season, Airs their softest balm impart; IX Not a breath too much or little, Not too hot or cold a ray; Must impede the Expectation, When 'tis meeting day. X Yet, perchance, these lovely flutt'rings, Beauteous fears, and kind distress, Do but serve the more to heighten Tender Henry's happiness. XI When the fair indeed approaches, Every rosy terror's o'er; After little scatter'd cloudings, Sunbeams only bless us more. Part of this Ballad has been set to Music by the ingenious Dr. Arnold.ADDRESS TO A LOCKET. I Come thou soft and sacred favour The remembrance chaste impart; Take thy station on my bosom, Lightly lodging near the heart. II While that tender thing shall flutter, Thou the secret cause shalt know; Whether pleasure or disaster Thou wilt see what stirs it so. III When the hope of happy tidings Shall the sweet sensations move, When the white and winged agents Whisper friendship, whisper love; IV Then all symathetic thrilling, Thou the rosy stream shalt guide; While as runs the ruddy treasure, Thou'rt the genius of the tide. V Haply when this heart is sinking Thou shalt soothe the rising sigh, When with woe surcharg'd 'tis sinking, Thou wilt see the reason why. VI Ev'ry curious eye escaping, Here securely shalt thou rest; Tho' the universe were searching, Thine the secrets of my breast. VII Come then dear and decent favour, Learn what thou wilt ne'er impart; Fix thy throne, and fix it ever, In the regions of my heart. VIII O'er these delicate dominions, Cast a Monarch's careful view, Render every subject passion Worthy me, and worthy you. IX Let not realms so rich, so tender, Suffer rebels weeds to grow, But the flowersâah! do not crush them, In vision sweet, oh! let them blow. X Gentlest sighs shall serve for breezes, Softly aid them, auburn friend; Silent tears, like dews descending, Shall the lovely growth attend. XI Thou shalt watch them night and morning, Thou shalt see the nurselings rise; Thou, with me, shalt tremble for them, Thou, with me, invoke the skies. XII If at length, alas! they wither, If they sicken, if they die, In one graveâoh! dear companion, Still embosom'd may we die. WITH A PRESENT OF SOME PENS SENT TO EMMA. I Go, ingenious artist, to her All ambitious to be prest; Dear disclosures of sensation; Agents of the gentle breast. II Whiter than your whitest feather, Is the hand which you'll embrace; Yet more white the fair affection, Whose emotions you shall trace. III Go, and take a charge upon you, Passing tender, passing dear; Oh, the trust you bear is wond'rous! Gentle agents, be sincere. IV Every sacred secret marking, Gods! how precious ye will prove! Softest sympathies imparting, Are ye not the plumes of Love? V When first floating on the river, Lovely was your limpid way; Lovely was your silver surface, Lovely was your wat'ry play: VI But for pastime still more lovely, Your sweet feathers now I send; What so lovely, prithee tell me, As the service of a friend. VII Faithful to the fair deposits, Your least stroke shall reach my heart; In its elegant recesses Shall be fix'd, what you impart. VIII Then dear instruments, I charge ye, Often tempt my Emma's eyes; Bid her press your downy feathers, Bid her speed the soft replies. IX Not the plumes which line her pillow Half so delicate shall prove; When all kind her pulses tremble, As your downy plumes of love. X Ye shall note her joy and anguish, Gentle agents, be sincere! Send me half each drop of sorrow; Rob me not of half each tear. XI Beauteous as the dews of morning, When they bathe the lovely flow'r, Are the lucid drops of Feeling, When from Fondness falls the show'r. XII Mark, I claim my just division; Mark, I promise just return; Some of your white-wing'd associates Must inform her how I mourn. XIII When long leagues our persons sever, Ye our wishes shall convey; Ye shall tell the pangs of parting, Ye shall hail the meeting day. XIV Save me, pow'rs! that strike the pulses, When invades the quick surprize; Yonder comes the gentle Emma, Hither she directs her eyes. XV How the feather I am using Trembles to the trembling heart! Agents, here behold a pattern! See a sample of your art. XVI Thus to me were Emma writing, (And her thoughts like Henry's kind) Sympathy would shake each feather, All expressive of the mind. XVII Go then, take this charge upon you, Passing tender, passing dear; Oh, the charge you bear is wond'rous! Gentle agents, be sincere. SONG. A POET there was, and he liv'd in a garret, And he quaff'd poor small beer, tho' he sung of good claret; A damsel he married both buxom and fair, And she sigh'd and took onâfor a chariot and chair. Derry down, down, &amp;c. One day as this bardling was scribbling a novel, His fingers in ink, and his head in a hovel, His spouse, in idea, was building a palace, And tripping in fancy from Dover to Calais. Derry down, &amp;c. âHad I a good fortune, dear Rhimewell (said she) I'd skim round the globe in my gilt vis-a-vis, I'd have tassels before and gay trimmings behind, And I'd move as I swung onâthe wings of the wind. Derry down, &amp;c. âHere John, bring my carriage, and whirl me awayâ First a stroll in the Park, then a peep at the play. Now, ye gods! I'd step out, and now I'd step in it, Change my dress, my diversions,âand man in a minute. Derry down, &amp;c. âAnd would not all this, my dear Bard, be most charming? To my pride be most soothing, to passions alarming? And then as I sat in my delicate jacket, How I'd fire all the folks with myârattle and racket!â Derry down, &amp;c. âAll this (said the Poet) is brave and uncommon, And enough I confess to distract a fine woman; But while you're thus dressing your heart and your head, I'm digging away for our butter and bread. Derry down, &amp;c. âSince such is our fate, dame, I prithee be quiet, For how can I write while you make such a riot? Consider, good woman, we live upon verses, And must only be poorer, while you talk of purses.â Derry down, &amp;c. PLEASING AND TEASING. A SONG. I Fair Rosamond long young Palemon ador'd, For pastime in bed, and for pleasures at board; Their pleasures, at first, were the pleasures of pleasing, Till such things gave way toâthe transports of teasing. II When at night she withdrew to the soft scene of rest, 'Twas âPalemon, my dearest, my sweetest, my best!â 'Twas then she enjoy'd all the pleasures of pleasing, But rose in the morn toâthe transport of teasing. III All mild as she came from the bosom of blisses, Yet thrilling with passion, yet soften'd by kisses, The sighs that broke from her were tenderly pleasing, And yet all gave way to the transport of teasing. IV âBy my love of a coach (cries the fair in a rage) Your form and your sense can no longer engage; Since we both are grown tired with pleasures of pleasing, I'm resolv'd to enjoy allâthe transports of teasing.â V âLet us part, then, to-morrow,â Palemon replies. âTo-night, if you please (the fair Rosamond cries) I've a man in thy eyeâfor the pleasures of pleasing, And I'll leave to Palemonâthe transports of teasing. VI âCall a hack there this minute, and let me depart, Wherever I go, I take with me my heart; I take with me too all the pleasures of pleasing, While I leave to Palemonâthe transports of teasing. VII The hackney was call'd, and away the fair drove, From all the delights of Palemon and love; For tho' hundreds appear'd for the transports of teasing, Alas! she found none for the pleasures of pleasing. VIII âAh hang it! (she cries) what a sad life is this! No joy in the chariot, no heaven in the kiss; In the day I have lost e'en the transports of teasing, In the night I have lost too the pleasures of pleasing. IX âIf thus I'm condemn'd like a stoic to sit, Neither touch'd by soft passion, nor tickled by wit; Ah! give me, kind gods, the dear pleasures of pleasing, And mix along with them the transports of teasing. X âOh! would but Palemon receive me again, Give one hand to rapture, and one hand to pain; I plainly perceive, in the cup that's most pleasing Ye have generously squeezed the acid of teasing.â XI To give both the lemon and sugar, was just; 'Tis the punch of existence, and drink it we must, If at night we may quaff the full goblet of pleasing, Let us patiently swallow the bumper of teasing. SONG. I Ah Love! who bade me languish, No more let me endure; Cease, cease, at length my angush, Thou ow'st thy slave a cure. II Enough, thy cruel arrows Have sported with my heart; Enough, its faithful sorrows Have throbbed in ev'ry part. III Then, God of all my anguish, This single boon I claim, Now let me cease to languish, Now strait subdue the flame. IV Or if still mark'd for bleeding, Thy slave I must remain; Oh let the wound succeeding Some worthier lover gain. V And Love, with this complying, Again let me endure; Than keep thy victim sighing, And never grant a cure. PROLOGUES AND EPILOGUES. PROLOGUE TO THE TRAGEDY OF CATO. Acted for the Benefit of the Invalids. Spoken at the Theatre Royal, in Dublin. The tender force of Charity to prove, And wake the social passions into love, To draw the cherub tear from Pity's eye, And strike the nerve of gen'rous Sympathy; To raise the bleeding hero from the ground, And pour Compassions balm upon the wound; To soothe the orphans and the widow's grief, And bring to honest Poverty relief; The sick to succour, and reward the bold, For this, to-night, âye are what ye behold,â For this soft Mercy, heav'n-descended Fair, Hath made a crouded Theatre her care, For this we play, well pleas'd the patriot's part, And woo the feelings of the public heart. And see how wide the social flame extends, Pointing to the Boxes.Here forms a radiant circle, To the Pit. there ascends, To the Gallery.Full in the center here I see it glow, There dart a glory on the plain below. What lovely Lucias, Marcias shine around, What noble Jubas grace yon glittering bound. Lo! Pity pleads the veteran warrior's cause, All hail the brilliant circle which she draws! With reverence bow we at her sacred shrine, O! who but proves her ardour is divine. The actor sinksâfarewell our mimic plain, My soul is soften'd, and I feel as man. PROLOGUE, WRITTEN FOR MRS. HUNTER, AT BIRMINGHAM. The passage birds, when Winter's surly powers Strips modest Nature and unrobes her flowers, Are forc'd by fate to leave their fav'rite shore, Or sleep immur'd till all the storms are o'er; But soon as Spring her rosy bloom displays, And in green mantle thro' the meadow strays, The twittering songsters hail their season nigh, And bless the coming of a genial sky; In feather'd troops on joyous wings they speed And all their little hopes at last succeed: Their household gods near every roof appear With all the blessings of the former year, Their ancient chimnies, nests securely hung Close to the friendly wall where grew their young. The well remember'd tiles too where they sate In playful circles, or in deep debate, Of all they take possession, grief is past And revel Summer smiles consent at last. Thus I long absent, my returning greet, And hail with reverence this my lov'd retreat, My heart confessesâscarce without a tear, The varied favours often granted here. Candour that smil'd on each attempt to please, And kind Applause which set that heart at ease. Here, like the passage bird, well pleas'd I come, Sport in your sunshine and avow my home, Around, above, beneath, again I see, Whate'er can set the flutt'ring spirits free. In every eye my Summer shines confess'd, And Fame's fair garland by your hands is dress'd. Bless'd be the wreathe, and doubly blest the spot, Where beauties thrive and errors are forgot, Where smallest flowers are nurs'd with tend'rest care Feel a rich soil, and prove the mildest air! EPILOGUE, SPOKEN BY MRS. SIDDONS, On her last Benefit Night at Bath. To please, to soothe, to soften, to unite, O'er Life's dark shades to draw the tenderest light, From grief the real object to erase, And show a fancied sorrow in its place; The shocks of Fortune, kindly to remove, And woo the powers of Pity and of Love, All these, blest office! to display, is ours. But ohâan office still more blestâis yours: Rich from the bounty of the public heart, Springs the lov'd recompense which crowns our art; The actor but reflects your generous aid, And thus by you his toils areâover paid, Curtseys. To nightâand shining thro' the grateful tears, An honour'd object of your smile appears; Appears herselfâto play no borrow'd part, But pour the tribute ofâthis throbbing heart. You gave me courage to pursue the scene, And when I fail'd your candour stepp'd between; Warm'd by your praise, I felt th' inspiring glow, And from that fount, my humble efforts flow; By you I spoke, thro' you I trode the stage, And try'd the Comic mask, the Tragic rage. Behold THIS night's sensationâin my eyesâ And faithful memory all the past supplies; YesâI am yours; and when you most approv'd, When most my little skill your plaudits mov'd, When you most honour'd what I anxious play'd, It was but smiling on the powers you made; 'Twas but approving your creative plan; Just as you sovereign artist smiles on man, Thus, the shrubs gratify the planters toil, Who, pleas'd surveys them flourish in his soil; Thus feeble streams acquire unwonted force, When daily fed by some superior source; Some sacred fountain the rich tide bestows, While broad as mine from you, each blessing flows. The generous terrors which ever accompany true genius prevented the admirable Performer, for whom this was written, from delivering it after she had studied it for that purpose; the event, however, of that night's exhibition proved that her fears were wholly unnecessary, and the Author has some claim on the kindness of the town, for having been instrumental in removing from a distant theatre (where, though her value was known and cherished, she had not âroom or verge enoughâ), to her only proper scene of action, (and within the general reach) one of the very first sources of their entertainment and delight.AN OCCASIONAL EPILOGUE, WRITTEN FOR MRS. SIDDONS AT DRURY-LANE THEATRE. On her first Appearance there after quitting Bath. Chear'd by the summer's sun and fostering gales, Should some light bark unfurl her little sails, Smooth down the stream in easy port she glides, Where scarce a breeze the silver wave divides; The sporting zephyrs with her pennants play, As safe she anchors in th' unruffled bay; No squalls molest, no deaf'ning thunders roar, But pleas'd spectators greet her from the shore; Lovers and friends run eager to the strand, And shouts of welcome echo thro' the land. But if once trusted from this friendly lee, She braves the perils of a wider sea, Where pilots, bred in tempest, dread the rock, And noblest vessels scarce sustain a shock; All hands aloft, th' affrighted crew would try Their wonted land-marks left behind to spy; Then climb the dizzy mast to trace the fort, And wish, alas, how vain! to ken the port; As Ocean heav'd, their terrors would increase, And he alone who rais'd could bid them cease. Thus I, adventurous, quit the harbour'd strand, Where late I coasted within sight of land, While wind and tide, and blazing beacons near, Prosper'd the voyage, and bade me boldly steer; Yet thirst of honest fame no fears restrain, But tempts the slightest skiff to try the main. For thisâyour smiles in view, myself I gave To this great deepâfor treasures on a grave; For this on dangerous service here I sail, The motive glory, your applause the gale; And if, oh transport! as I distant roam, Thro' you I bring some little venture home, All hail the varied pains and pleasures past, Since to good moorings Pointing to the stage. here I come at last. EPILOGUE TO THE TRAGEDY OF THE FATAL INTERVIEW. Spoken by Mrs. Siddons at Drury-lane Theatre. Pray don't be frighten'dâtho' I'm dead you know; Grief took me offâthe plot would have it so. You saw me drop, where legions have been slain: You see me hereâwell pleas'd to live again. This tragic Author has such comic ways! Rise Ma'amâpray riseâthe Epilogueâhe saysâ I roseâWhat miracles are work'd by bards! Work'd too byâslightâlike Jonas on the cards; Expert the cheat, yet all a trick profess'd, And he most pleasesâwho deceives you best. Our Author tho', is a peculiar man, Who kills his heroes on no hackney'd plan. Your Blank-verse fate I've brav'd a hundred times, And my last dying speech oft made in rhimes, Endur'd Poetic murders by the score, But seldomâbroke my heart in Prose before. 'Twas no stock dagger gave to-night the blow, No tragic tinâwhose tricks full well you know. Such weapons, blunted in our scenes of death, Are grown unfit, to stop a lady's breath. By Nature taught with other strokes to move, Our modest bard no proud embroidery wove, Pois'd no false poiniard to exact a start, But drew a simple blade that reach'd the heart. Instead of wordsâthose bubbles in our bowl, He touch'd the string that harrows up the soul; Instead of pompsâhe gave the true despair, Which breathes a passion, and which looks a prayer! No trump indeed presag'd a battle near, He owns, no plumage nodded o'er the bier; He call'd not even the mantle to his aid, That useful engine to our bustling-trade; But spoke to Parent, Husband, Sister, Wife, The genuine language of domestic life, Told a chaste tale of family distress, And less had pleas'd you, had he pain'd you less: He rouz'd the grief which ornaments conceal, The bosom'd pang, which all who saw may feel. Oh then forgive, if for âthe suits of woe,â He wak'd a sorrow âthat surpasseth shew;â And thinkâhowe'er the charms of Verse succeed, A death in Prose resembles Death indeed. For meâdevoted to your gentle sway, I live to please you, die but to obey; Kill or am kill'dâall ways am sav'd or slain, And now but beg my lifeâto die for you again! PROLOGUE FOR THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF MRS. SIMPSON. After the Departure of Mrs. Siddons from the Bath Theatre. When Nature's favourite from the scene withdraws, Hard is the task to plead a stranger's cause; When Siddons, honour'd, lov'd, rever'd, departs, Ah! who may claim her empire in your hearts? Where still enthron'd, her worth, her talents shine, The fairest image of the richest shrine; Where fondly cherish'd all her powers we trace, The truth of action and the charm of face, Transcendant manners, conduct void of blame, And Cibber's genius join'd to Pritchard's fame. Yet, no usurper she who sues to-night, No bold invader of another's right; A lawful potentate, whose genial sway According hearts in distant realms obey, In ancient York, she held supreme command, But takes your sceptre with a trembling hand: Hither invited, anxious she appears, The conscious victim of her generous fears, And tho' array'd in laurels comes the fair, (The Northern world ne'er knew a brighter star) And tho' some generous hopes her heart assail A thousand modest terrors still prevail; In vain we tell her Siddons 'self you rear'd, Her hopes expanded and her spirits chear'd, Fenc'd from each wind the flower and bade it grow, Delighted, nurs'd, and saw its blossoms blow; Vain too we urge that merit well supplies, The towering stature and heroic size, As vain the candour we have felt we praise, You only you can hush the storms you raise: And since the Sun which lately gilt our skies At length retires, in Mrs. Siddons at that time was performing at Drury-lane. other worlds to rise, This gentle planet may ascend our sphere, And by your sanction fix her orbit here, On this fair spot diffuse a milder glow And thus reflect the radiance you bestow. PROLOGUE TO THE ORPHAN OF CHINA. Spoken by Mr. W. Fector, at his Private Theatre in Dover. From Hiersall gazing on his Georgian star, To daring Jeff'ries balancing in air, The law supreme that governs human kind, Pleasure to give and take we still shall find, Social the source whence all our passions flow, Mutual is every joy and every woe: Nor e'er to self we stint the liberal flame, Which gilds the path of glory or of fame. Hence, Sirs, each glowing purpose of the soul, And parts, as sung the bard, but serve the whole: Hence issues forth âindebted and discharged,â The generous feeling and the thought enlarged. Hence young Ambition spreads her proudest sail, Power climbs the mountain, and Peace decks the vale; Hence Sculpture bids the soften'd marble warm, And Painting emulates life's vivid form: Music her voice, and Poesy her lyre, With equal incense feed the social fire. Love breathes his vow, Compassion drops her tear, Pleasure and Pain both pay their homage here: The world's great drama this fair truth can tell, Not for themselves alone, would men excel. To-night, no less obedient to the power Of social pleasure, we devote the hour, To cheer the gale that chills the coming spring, To melt the snow yet lodged on Winter's wing; Like lovers, we, by moon-light woo the heart, And try the powers that grace the scenic art! Friendship for this calls Candour to our stage, Who brings no catcall, bids no party rage: The shining rows that grace this little round, Will fright our heroes with no fearful sound; Arm'd with no terrors do our critics sit, To rowl the thunder of a London pit: No awful phalanx sedulous to blame, Blasts the fair rose-buds of our private fame: The full-grown flowers, which on her summit grow, Conscious we quit, to crop the shrubs below. All our kind Gods too, are from malice free, Our members ne'er divide, but all agree; And tho' both sexes on our edicts wait, In a full house we dread no harsh debate; A zeal to please ye animates us all; And should we fail, your smiles would break our fall: Yet if we please not, our best hopes we maim, âSelf-love and social,â we shall feel âthe same.â EPILOGUE. Spoken by the Same. Well, Dames and Sirs, we've had rare doings here, Princes in van, conspirators in rear! To-night you've seen what patriots were of yore, Tyrants you've heard declaim, and Tartars roar: Nor dare ye now deny they were indeed A race of mortals wond'rous apt to bleed. The dames of China were so fond of death, Maids, on their wedding night, gave up their breath, And husbands (Ladies how unlike your own) Stole off, before the honey-moon was down. Your Eastern bridegrooms offered up their wives, Whene'er the general welfare claim'd their lives; Each beauteous victim, at her Lord's command, Took the dire instrument of fate in hand, Amidst the red-hot pile undaunted stood, Burnt, hung, or drowned, for the public good. âDo die, my dear,â the tender husband said, âThis for thy country,ââthen struck off her head. Untimely deaths were then, indeed, so common, Woman for sport kill'd man, as man kill'd woman. A bowl of poison was the virgin's end, She drank it offâand call'd it Virtue's friend, Bent her white bosom to the patriot blow, And saw the streams of life unheeded flow. Then whisper'd her kind Lordâbut not to save her, Give him the blade:âhe thank'd her for the favour, âTake it my dearestâsoft!âyou know the rest,â The good man seiz'd and plung'd it in his breast; Then side by side, most lovingly they lye, Kiss and expire without one dastard sigh. To Britons turn we from such tribes as these, Britons, who please to live, and live to please; Our English dames, such killing customs hate, And born to conquer, ne'er submit to fate. Should some deep ruin on their country press, Too generous theyâto leave her in distress. Instead of dyingâthey like patriots stout, Boldly live on, and tire the mischief out. Or if some off'ring the stern fates require, They nobly spareâtheir husbands to the fire, âYes, ye lov'd LordsââWe give ye up, they cry, â'Tis for the general good ye all should die;â Alas, sad widows, sure our hearts will break! But we will bear it for our country's sake. âYet, oh dear martyrs, what we still must dread, âIs lest the state again should bid usâwed.â Ye pride of Albion, your's the graceful art, To point with nicer skill the potent dart; Your's the soft privilege, whole ranks to kill, And make death lovely, tho' no blood ye spill; Ye, like the chalky cliffs that guard our coast, Assert your skies, and are yourselves an host; Tho' of young roses are your fetters made, In vain would lion man their force evade: Tho' your triumphant car is drawn by doves, And to the wheels your captives tied by loves. Not vex'd Ixion e'er was bound so fast, And while you frown the punishment must last. Fame, life, and death, are in your conquering eyes; And of each polish'd art your smiles the prize: O, for our toils, in every beauteous face, Those fair rewards of pleasing may we trace.

THE SHADOWS OF SHAKESPEARE: A MONODY, IN IRREGULAR VERSE, Occasioned by the DEATH of Mr. GARRICK. The drawing from which this engraving is taken, and that which embellishes the opening of the 4th volume, are by a very eminent pencil, and were a present to the Author of these Miscellanies. I. Soon as the breath of Rumour blew This solemn theme into the general ear, To holy Solitude I flew, And bade the Muse her sympathy prepare! There closeted with Thought, The brain its shapeless travail wrought! The season to the subject solemnly did suit: Day's dazzling orb was wholly down: Pale Cynthia sat upon her silver throne; Th' obtrusions of the light were clos'd It seem'd, as Silence self repos'd, For with the Air, the Earth and all her sons were mute: All but the wretched, who, like me, The gentle vigils kept of sympathy. With cordial awe I liailed the shading night, And kiss'd her dusky-robe which muffled thus the night. II. Base busy world, begone, begone, I said, To mighty Garrick yield the serious mind, This awful Now be sacred to the dead, And turn the cautious key on human kind. III. The deadâah, me!âwhat dead?âHere it began The florid Poet felt himself a Man. And is he dead, whose wonder-working art So often tone, and touch'd, and tun'd the heart? Whose piercing eye intelligence could give, And bid long-buried beings look and live? Whose voice enrich'd the verse his Shakespeare writ, And gave to every word its weight of wit; No sentence blemish'd, marr'd no golden line, But polish'd, as he drew it from the mine; Whose tongue grew wanton in his Shakespeare's cause, And gave to crowded Theatres their laws; Whose powerful accents, soften'd or sublime, Free from all frippery, false pause, false chime, Chain'd, as to th' attracting centre, every ear; And, all commanding, sway'd the smile and tear: Is it to Him the Muse must pay Her tributary lay? For him, must aching Memory pour the strain, Must she her honour'd Garrick's loss complain? IV. The heart was hurtâIt could no moreâ Along each finer nerve swift shot the misery, Even Nature shed her pensive shower; The mighty Mother wept, alas! with me: Th' imperial Goddess mourn'd her own decay, (Mix'd universal with our human clay) And wish'd she could a second birth bestow On this her Representative below. But, ah! it might not be, So the rich debt was paid, to poor Humanity. V. Then in the sable stole of woe, All conscious of the blow, Pale her cheek, her eye declining, Half obedient, half repining; Her visage mark'd by many a tear, (Pour'd from the crystal source of grief sincere) In awful state, Unfortunate and great, Melpomene came on, Afflicted for her Son, And thrice, methought, the Bowl she lifted high, And thrice she threw on Heaven the pity-moving eye; Then, like the statue of Despair, Stood fix'dâher dagger pois'd in air. VI. Now 'twas Thalia first conceiv'd a pain, 'Twas now she echo'd back her sister's sighs again; The jest, the laugh, the look, were o'er, Her cunning was no more; The comic mirth, the comic pride, Her wit, her whim, with Garrick dy'd; Disdainful then the mask she flung To vacant airâand thus forlorn she sung: And ah! away with random rhyme, Tinsel ill-suited to the time; Away with leisure's coxcomb line, The couplet quaint, the stanza fine; Far from our verse be now the pun, the point, The period measur'd joint by joint; Th' elaborate trade of poesy forbearâ O rather paint the workings of despair; Scorn the vain edging sable Verse assumes, And let dark Elegy pass on, in all her pompous plumes. The honour of the Dead in view, A juster path will we pursue; Shakespeare himself, who best our state can feel, Shall the sad tale in his own language tell. VII. Th' inspiring Goddess, mortals Fancy name, With all her magic arm'd, now near me came Her waving wand, deep midnight deeper made, With her I wentâto where our Garrick laid. Cynthia lent a feeble ray, To light us on our way! Fancy with printless footsteps trod, As if advancing towards a God! Methought we easy entrance found, And the drear Abbey walk'd around. How fearful thus, ye Heavens! to tread, The dampsome vaults which close the dead! VIII. But softâ As at the foot of mighty Shakespeare's tomb I kneelâsudden along the fretted ailes Innumerous shady forms, by the pale moon's Imperfect beam beheld,âin various guiseâ (Each in the habit worn in days of Nature) Appear, and pour their potent spells upon me! Aw'd by a sight so strange, aloft I stood, And wist not what to do:âthe figures mov'd! On near approach I knew them for the Train Of Shakespeare: Then in procession sad, Strait, one by one, his hallow'd homage paid O'er Garrick's grave all bending. IX. Ariel first, (Not sight-deceiving, as her custom was, When in the bowels of the earth she div'd; âOr mounted on the sharp wind of the North, âOr on the curling clouds, or sunny ray, âNor like a spirit at easeâ) but with step DeliberateâShe, and her fellow-ministers, (âBrimful of sorrow and dismayâ) stood mute, Then gaz'd upon the graveâthen sunk in sighs. X. Prospero, The great magician, nextâ(whose high command âWak'd sleepers in their graves, and let them forthâ) Beheld the vanishing instrument of's art, And spakeâ âHave ye, which are but air, âA touch, a feeling of our loss extreme; âAnd shall not I, one of his kind, be kindlier? âOur revel then is done; and this our Actor âIs now no more! Lost is the book of Conjuration:â âHe regulated all our mystic charms:âHe's dead! âThe cloud-capt tow'rs, the gorgeous palaces, âThe solemn temples, the great globe itself; âYea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve, âAnd, like the baseless fabric of a vision, âLeave not a wreck behind.â XI. He said, and paus'd. The weir'd Sisters then, hag-born and horrid, Mutter'd their melancholy homage hoarse; Cold distillations of distress extreme Fell down the furrows of each wint'ry cheek: Thrice pac'd they piteous round the hallow'd earth, Acknowledging their Lord. To Garrick's grave Bow'd every swarthy She.âTo end their rites, Imagination's owl flapp'd her fell wing, And, wailing, shriek'd as 'cross the dome she flew: Sudden, the whirring wizards disappear, And horse themselves upon the viewless winds. XII. The gentle Romeo was the third which came; And oh! he said,ââTurn back dull Earthâah, me! âCan I go forward when my friend is here? âIt is even soâThen I defy you stars! âRomeo shall never more be Romeo now âHis occupation's gone.ââ XIII. The noble Coriolanus was the fourth, Whose very shade look'd martialâfirm he strode, And thus with Roman dignity exclaim'd, In honour of the Dead: âMy fame like thine âDemands an equal voice, an equal tongue: âAll eyes spoke of thee, and the bleared sights âWere spectacled to see theeâthe veil'd dames âCommit the wave of white and damask, in âTheir nicely gauded cheeks, to th' wanton spoil âOf PhÅbus' burning kisses: such a pother, âAs if that whatsoever God had tun'd thy throat âWere slyly crept into thy human powers, âTo give thee grace and posture. Oft, great shade! âThe dumb men throng'd to see thee, and the blind âTo hear thee speak. To thee have Nobles bended, âAs to Jove's Satue; and the Commons made âA shower and thunder with their caps and shouts âAs ne'er were seen the like.ââThe soldier pass'd. XIV. The fifth sad spirit that stalk'd by was Lear's, Mad as the vext sea still; and singing oft; Crown'd, as of old, by Shakespeare's hand; with fumiter, With hardocks, hemlocks, nettles, cuckoo flowers, Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow In the sustaining cornâ At sight of Garrick's tomb his wounds again Bleed fresh. Tottering he mov'd; his words were wild: âYou do me wrong to call me out o'th' grave! âAnd yet I know thee, Man!âHeav'n has thee now! âThou wer't Lear's friend.âIn faith I do remember.â âYes, we were both as stout a pair:âbut why âThis truant disposition? Is the greatest man âSo poor and forked an animal in death?â âOff, off, you lendings, come unbotton hereâPoor shade! âNo more of that, no more of that.â XV. The figure next succeeding was the Thane's, Languid and penitent.âHis hand he wav'd As 'twere in honour of the man, whose voice Did blow his base design in every ear: Malice was dead within him, and he wept; Then striking thrice his bosom, thus he cried: âOh Nature! how thyself thou blazon'dst âIn this thy Son; form'd in thy prodigality âTo hold thy mirror up, and give the time âIts very form and pressure:âwhen he spoke âEach aged ear play'd truant at his tales, âAnd younger hearers were quite ravish'd; âSo voluble was his discourse.âYet, being dead, âI am a man again!ââHe rush'd along. XVI. The gallant Anthony then onward strode And paus'dâas 'erst o'er CÃ¦sar's corse:âthen spake: âThou art the ruins of the noblest man âThat ever liv'd in the tide of Time! âHere was an Actorâwhen comes such Such another, however, is comeâSee Siddons. another? XVII. The next a female form, of Percy's line, A race for ever nobleâthus her tribute gave: ââThou wert the very glass âWherein the noblest youth did dress themselves; âThere were no legs that practis'd not thy gait; âThere were no eyes that practis'd not thy looks; âEven those that spoke but low and tardily âWould turn their own perfections to abuse, âTo seem like Thee: So that in speech, in gait, âIn accents, and affections of delight, âThou wert the mark and glass, copy and book, âTo fashion others; and on thee, as on âMy Harry and the Sun, bright Honour stuck, âAs sticks the Sun in the grey vault of Heaven.â XVIII. And now, the melancholy Jaques advanc'd, And, full of matter, thus in few, exclaim'd: âWhy all the World's a stage, âAnd all the Men and Women merely players: âThey have their exits and their entrances; âAnd this Man, in his time, play'd many parts. âLife! No more on't; it is a tale, told âBy an idiot, signifying nothing.â XIX. At last, with philosophic step, Swift-streaming eye, and arms entwined close, The sacred shade of his own Hamlet came: Long time he paus'dâlong time around he look'd, Then fix'd his view upon the grave, and spoke: â'Tis not now, seems; in verity, it is; âOh, what a grace was seated on that brow! âAn eye, like Mars, to threaten or command; âA combination and a form indeed, âWhere every God did seem to set his seal, âTo give the world assurance of a Man! âAnd is it come to this?âbut hush, my heart! âHe was a Man, take him for all in all, âWe may not look upon his like again.â XX. While wrapt in wonder of these various shews The sovereign shade of Shakespeare awful rose, His many-colour'd wand he wav'd, And soon the mournful train again were grav'd. (Now was His genius even more divine,) And all alone he stood before his Garrick's shrine. Rest, rest, perturbed spirits, then, he said, To me belongs th' inestimable dead; To each 'tis given to breathe, to fall; 'Tis the fix'd lot of all that soar or crawl. For Thee, much honour'd friend, What glories mark'd thy end! Applauding nations own thy fame, And, blend their Garrick's, with their Shakespeare's name: Together then we mount on high, 'Tis our's to triumph, 'tis the World's to sigh. THE SYSTEM OF PYTHAGORAS. EXPLODED BY HIMSELF. 'Tis all a fable, Sirs, you know, So let us take a turn below: Elysium, on this fourth of May, Must look prodigious green and gay; On earth it 'gins to bud fair weather, Let us then seek full bloom together. Breathe but to fancy half a prayer, Her painted plumes shall waft you there: For wings the Goddess hath all over, And freely lends to those who love her. Then let all present just tack on, A pair a-pieceâthe journey's done. What, tho' the road was under-ground, Is there a bar can fancy bound? Lord, what a whirl! at one deep dive, In this blest region to arrive! Ere your repeaters could strike seven, Ladies, I've landed you in Heav'n! How balmy breathes the atmosphere, A charming spring below this year; The wreathed myrtles seem in bloom, And shed Parnassean perfume: These verdant trophies must be plac'd In Paradise by souls of taste, When like May bees they hither come, To cull the sweets of Miller's room. How fresh the fields, how soft the air! I greet our safe arrival there. Yet, let us not at random rove, Our business lies in laurel grove; And yonder, see it fair, unfold, Burnish'd with variegated gold; Or ting'd with a poetic hue, Clearer than Heav'ns ethereal blue, All neatly scollop'd at the end, While rosy ripe, the branches bend But broader, gloomier shades, you see, Spread from each scientific tree. Unlike the blossom'd boughs of wit, Few are the flouncings they admit: Their sober shadows chill the ground With venerable verdure round. Behold! Pythagoras appears, The pride of nature's earlier years Near him the heavenly harp we find, With which each morn he sooth'd his mind His golden verses grace his hand, And there the Samean sages stand; Th' Italic sect you there behold Vers'd in the lore we now unfold. But wherefore these in human shape? Why not in eagle, emmet, ape? These still are men; have hands, have feet! Who hath the system overset? I thought (and so good folks did you I see you wonder as you view) I thought the book worm's shifted soul Might take apartments in an owl: I thought to see Dan. Pope a swan, After his soul had done with man; And many a tuneful soul, in love, Cooing soft couplets in a dove; Huge elephants I thought to find The lodgings of the learned mind; Pindar's pure soul in Eagle mould, And Gray's on the same perch of gold; Hammond, a turtle should appear, And Swift, in Satyr shape, be here: Sages, turn'd moths, I hop'd to meet, Fix'd still to literary treat; Tuck'd snug betwixt the leaves where lie, These grubs of old philosophy. Thus, Pye, we thought thy doctrine ran, Brutes were to lodge in soul of man; And spirits gone, to take the forms Of letter'd mites, or learned worms, Or flit about till they could find A body of congenial kind. Who knows, but some of those before ye, Firmly relying on your story, From Miller's mansion came, with me, Their old acquaintances to see; Some lovelorn friend, a Philomel, A monkey beau, a gold-finch belle. But not one bird or beast is here, And thou, thyself, a bearded seer. Well; be it so. We're glad to find Thy system but a whisk of wind; A vapour, which was idly spread From fume of metaphysic head. A pretty thing, indeed, if we Could sport thus with futurity! If after death, we could with ease Take any likeness that we please; Or be compell'd to animate Some horrid carcase which we hate; Queer incidents would teem on earth, From these strange laws of second birth. Why, at that rate when plagues seem'd o'er; When factious wife can scold no more; When, as a woman she was dead, 'Tis but her woman form that's fled; Thy scheme would bring her home again, And thus redouble every pain; Now in a cat a spouse would claw, Or mouth and chatter in a daw; Vain wou'dst thou starve her in the cage In some fresh formâthe jade wou'd rage, Nay more, we all should murderers prove, And mangle those we really love. Hold, butcher, hold th' uplifted knife, In yonder calfâyou kill your wife; Touch not, dear Madam, yonder dish, Your husband's soulâis in the fish; There swims an Alderman in gravy, Dory! the Alderman shall save ye! That venison, Miss, I beg you'll spare, Your roving lover'sâroasted there! Oh! pass that brute and chuse another, In that chaim'd ape, behold thy brother! Strange turns would happen, friend Pythag. If true this system of a wag. Perhaps the babe, but newly born, A kitten mews the following morn; Then, if not sav'd by Miss, or Master, Thou know'st the wawling thing's disaster; No tabby streaks, alas! avail, Drown'd is thy infantâin the pail!! To hunt the hare too were a sin, Thy sister's soul may pant within; The very hounds who yelp and tear, May be first cousins to the hare. The worm, within his earthly nest, Might diet on a parents's breast. Beware too pastimes of the gun, A guardian in a fox might run; A husband in a buck might go, His Lady, weeping, as a doe; Stretch not the Ox upon the plain, Pull not the Lion by the mane; Should a King's soul be in the beast, It is high treason at the least! Boy, do not draw your bow and arrow, You'll shoot a coxcomb through a sparrow; Child, do not chace that butterfly, A fop expires if it should die; You'll hang a lover in your dog, And stick a Lord Mayor in a hog. In short, friend Pye, it will not do, Thy transmigrations are not true! I own it all, the Sage replies, (Thou see'st the sacred father rise) These sallies then of wit forbear, And bless the cause which brought thee here: Had I no reason while on earth, To give th' Italic system birth? In looking various Nature through, Man, bird, and beast, appear'd in view; Men play'd the part of brutes, and then Brutes better seem'd to me than men: The ugly soul, in alter'd shape, Figur'd superior in an ape: 'Twas an amendment of its race, To give a beau a monkey's face; Better to let the dull soul pass Into the body of an ass; When the false friend a spaniel fawn'd, Wise was the change, for folks were warn'd, And whatsoe'r befel the creature, It made no vacuum in Nature. When I beheld the miser's heap, And saw his sordid spirits creep All jealous, tow'rds his cank'ring hoard, Which not a charity afford, I gave the wretch a juster form, And thrust his soul into the worm! Or when the epicure I saw O'er-stepping Nature's modest law, His soul I give a fitter shrine, Associate of the gorging swine! Yet, these are sentiments I long Have felt to be exceeding wrong; False was the system I confess, Of punishment and happiness: Nor would you find me here to-day, Wer't not to point a nobler way: Scarce had I gain'd the Elysian shoreâ FarewellârecedeâI dare no moreâ He's gone, you see! what means the Seer? And Fancy, too, doth disappear; What! must we now unguided go, And puzzle out these paths below? 'Twill prove, in troth, a pleasant tour! Ah, me! what light begins to pour From yonder skirtings of the sky; What god-like form gains on the eye, Awes, as it moves, each frolic sense, Commanding love and reverence? 'Tis the blest founder of a nobler plan, Guardian of glory and the friend of man, No fairy land, no visionary shade, We bow before him in the world he made; 'Tis God himself! he opes the book of light, And loâall other systems sink in night! Behold the Christian banner he displays, And infidels turn converts as they gaze, Truth holds the golden revelation high, While chosen cherubs fix it in the sky. See the thick mist of ignorance is fled, See gospel radiance rises on the dead; In antient darkness we no longer go, Nor wander wilder'd in the shades below! Vain ev'ry fabled hill, and heav'nly grove, Virtue and Vice have surer laws above. In every Christian heart is writ their meed, 'Tis demonstration, and who will may read. THE FAMILY OF TIME: OR, THE APPARITIONS OF YESTERDAY, LAST NIGHT, AND TO-MORROW. On the Subject of Procrastination. Written in irregular Verse. Of man's miraculous mistakes, this bears the palm, That all men are about to live: The thing they can't but purpose, they postpone. Dr. Young. The âdarkness visibleâ of dawn Dimly proclaims the dubious morn! The clock goesâWhat?âAs I'm alive, Its moral finger points to five! It strikes! I hear the lapse of time, And rise to write the loitering rhime. Another stroke! Like solemn Young, I feel the âAngelâ in its tongue; The myrtled morning is come on, And nothing for the Vase yet done! But soft! on yonder side the table, Comes the kind Muse, in suit of sable, Solemn and slow she walks along, Procrastinating song. In allegoric robes profound She sweeps the visionary ground. Checks Wit's wild sally, and in sober rhime, Summons the shades of hoary Time! With her, on Fancy's plume I fly, And see the feather'd progeny; Hours, minutes, moments, rise to sight, And all the lucid family of light. And first, all humid with her tears, Behold a deeply injur'd fair, The ghost of Yesterday appears, A weeping vision, thin as air. The sick sigh from her bosom breaks, And shivering in her shroud she stands, Pale as the scroll within her hands, And thus in accents, tremulous, she speaks: âAt earliest peep of orient morn, âWith fair Aurora was I born; âI help'd Hyperion to his horse, âAnd ran with Sol his radiant course; âTwelve fleeting hours I drew my breath, âThen sunk into the arms of Death! âSoon as my light of life was fled, âA sister reigned in my stead; âTime, with his glass, stood pensive by, âAnd gave me to Eternity. â'Twas then that to the sphere of day, ââDay without night,â I bent my way; âTh' Immortal call'd me, and I stood âWith those that fell before the flood, âThe first-born of my scythe-crown'd Sire, âIn pure and primitive attire; âWith the first sun-beam of the sky, âAnd ev'ry pendent orb on high: âWith these, and all the race of light, âFast by the throne I stood in sight; âMy great progenitors I saw, âAnd felt a reverential awe: âThe trumpet soundedâevery knee âWas bent in solemn sanctity, âStrait YESTERDAY was call'd aloud! âI fearful pass'd the shadowy crowd, âThen bow'd before the heav'nly powers, âAttended by my kindred hours. âUnfold the scroll,â an Angel cry'd, I op'd the pageâthe Angel sigh'd! âAnd is that all thou can'st display, âUnhappy shade of YESTERDAY? âWhat do I see? (pale ghost!) a train âOf follies light, of fashions vain, âOf actions little, passions mean, âOf dealings dark, of deeds obscene, âOf havock, horror, lucre, lust, âOf fractur'd faith and broken trust, âOf villainy in dark disguise, âOf widows groans, of orphans sighs: âOh, what a register is here!â The Angel dropt an Angel's tear; Then paus'd. Poor Yesterday withdrew. Another ghost appear'd in view; Dusky as Death the robe it wore, Its air distrait, its garment tore: âAnd what art thou? the Angel said, âSpeak, Stygian vision, funeral shade. âNight is my name,â the spectre cry'd, âAt the first tinge of morn I died. âMy sable catalogue behold, âSacred to darkness and to gold; âA sepulchre of sin my book, â'Twill wound Day's âpitying eyeâ to look: âSeductions, murders, wound the sight, âAh! did you know what pass'd last light; âThe deeds which mark the midnight hourââ âEnough: Retire! replied the Power; âOnce more let Yesterday appear.â She came, and dropt the conscious tear, Then spoke: âThis leaf, O Angel, read, âI'm not without one gen'rous deed. âOn this reverse you may behold âA nobler use of light, and gold, âSome minutes in memorial rise, âAnd of my hours some few were wise. âClose on this corner of the leaf, âObserve a mark like that of Grief; âBut 'twas not Grief which caus'd this tear, â'Twas Gratitude, 'twas Joy, wept there. âFrom points of time, O take my best, â'Tis Mercy's to o'erlook the rest.â âNor be extreme, said Night, to mark âAll the transactions of the dark: âTho' the assassin sought my aid, âAnd robbers lurk'd beneath my shade; âTho' Murder at my stillest hour âDrew the dire blade, and blest my power; âTho', when in ebon spheres enthron'd, âI saw the virtues half postpon'd, âSaw Poverty by Wealth forgot, âAnd skreen'd the knave from being caught; âYet in my list some graces flow: âPermit me, Chief, th' account to show, âSketch'd, Seraph, in this page you trace âSome lineaments divine of grace; âHere, midnight prayers are written down, âWhile men were with their God alone; âAt the twelfth hour, a spirit blest, âUnmurmuring sought the realms of rest: âPity, a starving creature fed, âAnd gave the wanderer a bed. âAbout the noon of my domain, âWhile slept th' insensible and vain, âA good man broke his own repose, âTo mitigate another's woes, âUnseen he blest my kind disguise, âAnd paid me for my former sighs; âSilent he sat beside the sickly bed, âAnd sooth'd the sorrowing heart, and held the throbbing head.â The Angel heard benign. The roseate glow Suffus'd his cheek, and tears began to flow; Charm'd with th' account that Night had giv'n, Then grateful fix'd his starry eyes on Heav'n. While thus he stood in thought profound, A sacred silence breathing round, Up rose a venerable Seer, To comment on the wasting year. âAlas! no cause for me to boast, âI am the DAY the Roman lost; âSome good, much ill, will always go âTo chequer every hour below. âSome flying centuries are past, âO Angel, since I breath'd my last; âLike YESTERDAY's, it was my fate, âTo see the world procrastinate; âMen vow'd To-morrow's sun should see âA general propriety; âTo-morrow rogues were to be just, âThus all was universal trust; âTO-MORROW should the miser lend, âAnd without usury be a friend; âThe prude, the rake, should faithful prove, âAnd live a life of mutual love. âIn short, TO-MORROW should be blest âWith all that's noblest, fairest, best. âIndeed, TO-DAY, folks were so hurried âBy passion, pleasure, business, flurried, âLadies had such a world to do, âSuch waggon-loads of matter new; âAnd men so press'd a different way, âAll begg'd, alas! another day, âTo carry on their usual cares, âAnd sure twelve hours could break no squares; âSo high and low, and rich and poor, âPush'd off amendmentâone day more. âBlest revolution! blessed morrow âAll hail, the fall of sin and sorrow! âSoon as I dy'd, my sister NIGHT âUsurp'd the sphere of former light, âThen languish'd at th' approaching morn, âAnd lo, the promis'd morrow born! âFresh from the ruddy East she sprung, âEarth, seas, and air, her triumph sung, âIn sunny vestments blithe she came, âLike me in every thing but name. âThe hist'ry of her actions spread, âDiscover'd scarce one folly dead, âNor scarce one rising virtue born, âBut many a promis'd fair she brought, âWith many a reforming thought; âMen were to mend the following morn; âThis following morn then rose to view, âAnother promise broke, another made anew. âWhat then can we, Time's children, say? âBut tell thy tale, pale YESTERDAY! âHear the sad narrative again, âAugmenting fraud, augmenting pain. âFrom first to last, throughout the nation, âTis all, alas! Procrastination. Thus spake the Sage, and went his way, And leaves to me the moral of the day. Behold experience point the vain command, Behold Reluctance chain the ling'ring hand. In proof of human brevity, Silent and swift the seasons fly: The sun, the moon, are form'd to show The constant flux of things below; Ocean and Earth assist the plan, And press their maxims upon man; The closing night, th' unfolding day, Denote the perils of delay. Yet stop not here:âanother line Affords a subject more divine: Hail'd be this theme of Miller's urn, In which a purer flame may burn. Upon this verdant shrine to day, One pious offering let us lay; Nor you, ye gayer Muses, sneer, Tho' holiest incense we burn here. Recited in Lent.To-day, the solemn thoughts invite, I feel their fervor as I write; The hours of Lent, we all agree, Appeal to man's humility, Increase Procrastination's blame, And change her folly into shame. Then, oh! by all a God inspires, By all a Christian's graceful fires, By all which to the soul is dear, The holy sigh, the heav'nly tear, Forgive the Poet, if his tuneful care Attempts this once a sacred wreath to wear; If on this serious day he tries his art To win th' immortal myrtleâof THE HEART. TENDERNESS. A Lover is supposed to have read the Subject of the Vase, and to exclaim as his Feelings suggest. WRITTEN IN IRREGULAR VERSE. Forbear! is Tenderness an Elegy? Ah, what will sadness do with such a theme? Say, is not love our happiness supreme? Say, is it not the soul of Poesy? Then bid the gentle Muse A fair title choose; Bid her invoke the dear Idalian boy; Bid her invoke the tuneful Nine, And let all sing this source of joy, Let all confess the subject is divine! Avaunt, the sombrous lay, 'Tis jubilee to day; And all the Aonian maids should sing The triumph (not the tear) till Aganippe ring: Away! away! it is not so; Cease! cease! that jarring song of woe! To sprightlier measures suit the lyre, And paint the bliss of innocent desire; Or if the Muse must needs complain, Soft let her touch the tender strain; O, bid her breathe the music of the lute, Or whispering warble of the melting flute; In thrilling notes of lovely anguish, Let every tone be taught to languish; Then change, and change again, till Echo, in reply, Leap from her chrystal cave to join the harmony. So ran the rhapsody of fire, Soon as young Marius saw the plaintive lyre; Fain would he have in ev'ry line The rose to blush, the lilly shine; Fain would he mix the summer ray With all the breathing balms of May; Hebe's rich bloom, with Venus' eye, Praise every tear, and boast of every sigh. And stop (said he) the jarring string, Again I bid ye strew the flowers of spring; From themes of extasy, Far, far, be Elegy! Then did he vaunt the passion of his heart, And triumph'd in the wound, and gloried in the smart. Lead on to Mira's bower, exclaim'd the youth, For Marius there she twines the tender flower; First hear and reverence the voice of truth, I saidâThen thus employ'd th' instructive hour: Is Love indeed, the drop which Heav'n In mercy to mankind has giv'n? Is it indeed, that cordial pow'r, Our little being's fairest flow'r? Which doth for ev'ry ill a recompense impart? O stripling, ere you quite decide, The passion turn on every side; Count well your losses, count your gains, Deduct your pleasures from your pains. Haply this drop will then appear Form'd of an agonizing tear; Haply, the drops of bitterest woe Do from this vaunted source more copiously flow! Ah, see the subject meet of solemn Elegy; If joy smile there, say doth not sorrow blend Her pointed poisons, and her searching sigh? Behold, fond youth, the family of pain, All mingle mischief in fair Venus' train; First Doubt displays her troubled air, And near her glooms the fiend Despair: Suspicion points th' ambiguous leer, And Grief presents her wounding tear; Fell Jealousy, accursed power! Comes forward at the midnight hour, Robs all he doats upon of breath, Then calls on Suicide for Death! Pale Penury is also there, And wan Uncertainty and Care! And ev'n the nuptial couch appears. Oft steep'd in Sorrow's baneful tears: Absence (the death of lovers) too, With Disappointment, is in view; And Expectation, lively power! Frets often at the passing hour; Possession's self your raptures chide, And seats Indifference near your bride; The warmest vows, the balmiest kiss, Oft end, alas, my friend, in this, Chill the chang'd lip, which glow'd before, And bid the pulses throb no more. The household demons too, I see, Fit subjects for an Elegy. For these, the world you need not roam, Observe that little world at home; Vexations on vexations rise, And joy with grief decides the prize. The fire-side frailties all are there, In form of vapour, freak, and air; The look of spleen, the word of strife, The pets, the pouts, of married life; The quick retort, the tart reply, The saucy toss, the sulky sigh, The female fit, the mannish pride, The sullens shown on either side; Th' obedient faint, the hectic dear, Hysteric catch, convenient tear; The wilful whine, the mutual wishes, The petty wrangle about dishes; The bounce which tells a quarrel nigh, The bitten lip, th' indignant eye, The silly flaunt, the cutting leer, The solid slap, the sorer sneer; The hard-slap'd door, which marks the last disdain, Till all chez vous doth ring with rage again. All these and many a worse distress, With sickness, folly, wretchedness; May grow, my friend, ev'n in your Mira's bower, So ponderâere you crop the attracting flower; Ponder it well, and will then deny, That Love, fond Love, affords full scope for Elegy? The youth impatient heard And listen'd to each word, Then spake:âAll this, perchance, is true, But where's th' exceptions of the chosen few? Dost thou involve mankind alike, In this misfortune and dislike? Shame on thy lyre, and on its strain, Break, prithee break, the chords in twain! Or learn a truer touch to know, And do not jumble matters so; Why, knowst thou not discordant fool, I'm an exception to the rule? Mira, who now expects me yonder, Is not more mine, than Nature's wonder; The Sun looks jealous from his throne, And sees his lustrous eye outshone. Doubt, she can never, for her truth Shall bless and decorate our youth; Suspicion she shall never know, My own fair faith informs me so; Secure from Jealousy's alarms, I'll lock her ever in my arms; And Penury she need not fear, Behold what hands for toil are here! Possession shall but more endear, And I will kiss off every tear; The warmest vows I will repeat, Till all the pulses stronger beat; And as for absence,âlo the sun DeclinesâAdieu, dear friend, I'm gone. Mutter, still mutter on (cold reasoner) whilst I Hasten to Mira's bower, and laugh at Elegy. The moral of the verse is plain, At once the lover owns and welcomes pain; The dear bewitching woe, we all confess, And feel a charm in our distress; The Petrachs and the Lauras all complain, But love prompts every sigh, and bliss directs the strain. The solemn Seer, and matron Muse, may school, Each lover's an exception to the rule; Each Marius has a Mira in the bower, Where Hymen lights his torch, and Venus shows her power. DELAYS ARE DANGEROUS. Delays are dangerousâAh, me! Ce'st bien vraiâas you shall see. And that example may be found, We'll turn the subject round and round. A time there is in woman's life, That fixes her a maid or wife. A ribbon'd youth with sword and sash on, Courting that pretty flirtâMiss Fashion; Romances thus on each lov'd feature: âGods! was e'er seen so sweet a creature?â Then struck the gorget on his breast, And warmer thus his flame express'd: âJove, what a brow! what bon-ton swim! âHer shape how elegantly slim! âWhat graces in that train behind! âEach fold denotes a taste refin'd. âThen such good breeding crowns the whole, âIn every movement there is soul. âMy angel, name the happy day; âBut let it quickly be I pray.â âThe First of April then, (says she) âI yield toâyour felicity. âYou men are so importunate, âBut wedlock's an affair of weight.â âO my adorable, I know, âAnd well he turn'd it to and fro. âAh, that the blessed morn were here! âMy love, my life, my soul, my dear! The usual thumps and sighings past, This blessed morn arrives at last. âWell now my charming Fashion! now, âCome, blooming come, fulfil your vow. âThus on his knee your Sword-knot begs.â âDo, pray Sir, get upon your legs. âTo see a soldier on his knees, âIn military times like these, âIs really shocking I protest!â âThis nasty cough so breaks my rest, âI have not slept a wink all nightâ âThen how I look!âI'm quite a fright! âIf I to-day were made your wife, âI'm positive 'twould cost my life. âTo leave my room some risks I runâ âObserveâI've still my night-cap on. âI am so ill and feel so queerâ âPray put it off nowâthere's a dear, âPostpone it, if you love your Fashion.â âPostpone it, Madam! (in a passion) âFire, flints, and fury! what d'ye say? âMay thunders rive me if I stay! âPlain yes, or no? I ask no more,â âFor heav'n's sake Sukey shut that door: âThere comes such whiffs into my neck, âAnd I'm so subject to a creek; âStay but a month for Pity's sakeâ âLord how I stretchâI'm scarce awake.â âFor ever, Madam, sleep for me, âI'll well reward your perfidy. âYes, Madam, sleep I say for ever, âNo more I'll trouble youâno never! âDelays are dangerous (he cries) âOh when will womankind be wise? âFarewel, go weep the occasion past, âYou'll prove the April fool at last.â And so she did. Her airs miscarried, She's forty-nine, andâstill unmarried. âSince Fortune gives th' power to bless, âIn pity soften my distress! âIf a small pittance you deny, âThis day, this hour, perhaps, I die.â A wretched suppliant thus in tears, Press'd by the load of life and years, To Sophron gay, his suit prefer'd, And thus his earnest wish was heard: âYes, honest man, I see you're poor, âAnd heartily your case deplore, âA little money you would borrow? âI'm busy now, but call to-morrow.â To-morrow is a day too late, Thus tolls the passing bell of fate; Delays are dangerous my friend, Or lend in time, or never lend: No gold can bribe the moment fled; Put up your purseâthe poor man's dead. A thing there isâye maids bewareâ Which once was young, might once be fair, Except an ogle now and then, Strange, her antipathy to men! In the same house to fleer and fling, There liv'd another ancient thing, Brother and sister, strange to tell, Thus led a life of ding-dong bell, This pair of antiquated wights, Full sadly past unspoused nights, For ever at each other rail, And this the burthen of the tale: âThat's downright malice sister Bridget ââAye you may fume, and fret, and fidget. âBut long since you cou'd offers boast, âI, was the dear Dorinda's toast. âShe hob'd and nob'd me by the hour, âSaid I had eyesâand felt their power; âThen bumper'd me each day at dinnerââ âLord, brother, whut a wretched sinner! âYour day, old batchelor was over âEre Salprunella was my lover; âWith me he fell in love you know, âWhen I receiv'd that ugly blow; âAnd as he bled my snowy arm, âSwore in each pulse he felt a charm.â âP'shaw! p'shaw! old maid, 'tis false as hell, â'Twas all a flamâyou feign'd unwell, âTo catch the doctor?âHah! to catch? âAt this they flounceâat this they scratch.â âAnd is it, brother, come to this? âSweet wither'd sirâââOh! blooming miss!â âMadam 'tis wellâââNo, Ma'am 'tis ill,ââ âBut I can ask the question still.â âCome then, it shallâit shall be married, âTho' fifty years it has miscarried.â âMa'am, Ma'am, 'tis falseââSir, Sir, 'tis true âYou were most slightedâââNo Ma'am you, âI'll leave the houseâââAye, prithee go, âThe apes are waiting you below,â âJohn call a coach,âââWith all my heart.â Slap goes the door, and thus they part. Brother and sister hold your tongue, Idly ye rail, for both are wrong, Your wrinkles, and your wranglings prove Delays are dangerous in love. Our muse shall array the fourth instance in sattin, And your tit-up-ing verse she can tell it most pat-in, Oh! ye zephyrs breathe gently on fair Mr. Sleek, For the rosesâof Warrenânow essence his cheek, Those sensative roses that die at the touch, And lose all their colour if blown on too much, Then the lillies of Moseneau blossom beneath, And Spence has a pension for guarding the teeth, At one every morning he rubs the brush thro' them, And the pretty one grins, that the ladies may view 'em; Then he rides! Oh ye Gods!âhe does ride to be sure, While the horse seems to aid his lov'd Lord in the lure: Each caper, each curvet, discovers his art, And every prance, sends a prance to the heart. But you say that the world will accuse me of satire, Why, I know that the world is most prone to good nature; But then I am talking of nothing you find, For this femaleish male has no meaning nor mind, Delays being dangerous, therefore I vote, (Since riddle-mee-rees are scarce worth finding out) I vote thatâno hang it, I will not be cruel, I will not provoke the dear thing to a duel: The Perfumer for damage would sue me at law, So the motion about to be made I withdraw; And with perfect good humour I change this dead letter, And leave this soft nothing for somethingâscarce better. Oh heavens! what spectre hov'ring o'er Is ent'ring now at yonder door, Where pale Lucullus gasps for breath? Angels and Ministers! 'tis Death! Close he stalk'd by me yester-night And my blood sallied at the sight. Lucullus beg'd another day, The bony Monarch went away; Lucullus promis'd to repent And begg'd a day with such intent. Death had no sooner left the room Than life and all its follies bloom, The bony Monarch finds him now Unmindful of the pious vow. Assumes the life disposing nod And shews the mandate of his God. âYet one more hour the culprit cries, âAs trembling on his bed he lies, âOne little moment yet dispense? âIt may not beâThou'rt summon'd hence.â âDelays are dangerous, thou fool, âMay Heav'n shew mercy on thy soul.â Young Claudio plays a desperate hand, What axes echo thro' the land! And scarce a lonely tree remains To screen the woodman from the rains, The sorrowing oxen, as they go, Curse thoughtless Claudio in their lowe; And presently those oxen die, Another handful to supply. The poor esteem its vastly cruel, There's not a stick to warm their gruel; Then execrate the gambler's art, Which opes the hand but shuts the heart; For Claudio vends his very faggots To bet upon a race of maggots. His birds too mourn, the ruin'd grove, Once vocal with the song of love. In good Sir Careful's thrifty day, They nested safe on ev'ry spray: Look, says a poor defruded thrush, Claudeo has stubb'd my nuptial bush. See, quoth a rook upon the ground, The duce a tree can now be found; Each house in our aÃ«rial town This spendthrift landlord has cut down, The man has ruin'd all my friends, And havock o'er each grove impends: But dearly shall he pay the scheme, He pluck'd us rooks, now rooks pluck him. âClaudio, that last was a good hit, âRise instant rise, the table quit, âDelays are dangerous.â âI go âSoon as I've tried another throw.â âDelays are dangerousâstop in time.â âP'shaw, nonsense! damn your boring rhime, âYou put me out.ââHe rashly threw, Lost the last guinea and withdrew, Delays are dangerous, he said, Then snap'd a pistol at his head. Thus, having swirl'd the theme about And pointed some examples out, 'Tis time to take my leave of verseâ O! for a couplet pat and terse! By way of moralâhang it now! When wit's most wanted none will flow: That's so provoking, Muse, so hard, Throws such a damp upon the bard, 'Tis really monstrous I declareâ And then a tag gives such an air. Indeed this sudden fall of snow Written in the deep snow. Makes hobbling Pegasus move slow. Would but the Museâhush! hush! behold her Lean from the Vase, and touch my shoulder; She whispers that I talk too long, Delays are dangerous in song; Her sacred Counsel I attend, And bring my poem to an end. ODE TO THE SUN. I. God of the Vase;âbright Guardian of the Urn; To thee with conscious gratitude we turn, By thee, our tender garlands grow, Our laurels shoot, our mirtles blow; By thee our Priestess forms her bower, Invoking still thy genial power. II. Thine, PhÃ¦bus, is the sparkling thought, The radiant verse, the glowing strain; From thee is inspiration caught, And thine the sunshine of the brain. III. To thee belongs the dapled Dawn, Noon's burnish'd beam and fervid flush; To thee the many-colour'd Morn, Twilight's last tinge, and Evening's parting blush. IV. To thee belong the tender babes of Spring, When the first down implumes the warbler's wing; The gorgeous Summer's rich expanse is thine, When scarce a breeze dare touch thy burning shrine; The various Autumn wooes thy gentler power, And, lingring, keeps for thee the latest flower. Trembling with age, even Winter courts thy sway, And begs the blessing of a casual ray. Frost too, for thee, climbs up the mountain's brow, And bends before thee in his robe of snow. V. In each gradation of thy course, From the grey moment thour't on horse, E'en till the radiant journey's run, And thy diurnal travel's done, How like, O Sun, how like art thou to Man! How like the little wretch, that plays Its gambols in thy warming blaze Thro' Life's contracted span! VI. When bursting forth from sealing night, The infant's eye first feels the light, Uncertain is its day; Some human frost may haply come, And drop it in th' oblivious tomb, To quench its short-liv'd ray. Thus, PhÅbus, e'er thou well canst show, The beauties beaming on thy brow, Oft doth a gather'd gloom invade And wrap the sunshine in the shade. VII. Or should kind Fate the infant spare, And paint, like thine, the morning fair; In Ã¦ther light, it treads like thee, And frolic youth enjoys it jubilee. The pulses all accordant play, The passions wanton in their May; And the heart dances up to manhood's day. VIII. Intensely then it glows, it burns, Like thee, is hot and cold, by turns, But soon the fierce effulgence fades, And hastens on the Evening shades; As thine, his noon-tide vigour dies, And the keen sun beams leave the mortal skies. The hey-day of the heat is o'er, And passion's storm is heard no more; The Twilight of Existence then, Falls fast upon the race of men; Dim and more dim, each object meets our sight, And our declining orb sinks at th' approach of night. Another glimmering moment yet, And Man's uncertain Sun is wholly set. CARDS, PRO AND CON. A FRAGMENT This Poem, in its original form, opened with some Hudibrastic lines.. The cards invite. Mortal thy verse too light, Too frolic and fantastical appears, Ill-sorted to our theme: far loftier lines, Such as of old majestic Milton chose, When he the mighty and soul-moving lyre, Struck with a master's handâstruck like a God, Or night-living Young, whose solemn harp Sounded a requiem to the sheeted ghosts Of pale Philander and of Narcissa fair; Or that commanding Bard to whom the key That opes the varying Seasons, Nature gave,â Sweet Thomsonâor e'en such as grac'd the lay Of him whose Phillips. Splendid Shilling, polish'd fair, Appear'd more glittering than a one-pound-one. Mortal attend.âWhat furious fatal form Leans o'er yon chair, like some detested wretch Sick of the sun!âSee, see he grasps the blade, And seems resolv'd to plunge it in his heartâ Awhile he stopsâAnd is all lost, he cries, In one deep ruin all my fortune whelm'd By one dire blow?âThen what is life to me? Hark, Justice callsâI hear her and obey; Why this is well tooâthis is blow for blow; He strkes, he faints, he falls, he groans, he dies. And see another spectacle comes forth, A female form, lean, languid, and decay'd. Is that Clarissa? she whose vermeil cheek, Flushing so late with all the paint of health, Fresh as the gale of Heaven! Disastrous change, Jaded and stript of fortune and her charms; Behold her supplicating yonder Lord, (Whom her ill luck enriched) for charity, The charity of one poor hapless meal,â Precarious boon!âthe fretted victim droops, And solitary pines her life away. But that gay, gamesome fair one,âshe whose hand Pats the sleek face of yonder silken fool, Yon emmet in embroidery.âIs it love Whose shaft impierces thus? What mighty flame Can make the female nature so unsex'd? Asks thou what flame? the raging flame of play! The last indulgence her fond husband gave; âHeâhapless man, sits in his lonely hut, Trimming the frugal taperâis all flown: Behold her sparkling creditorâkind soul She taps his cheek, assents to all demands, Sets virtue on a cast, and all is paid. Good Heavens! what rustling rapid she is that, Who with a restless air and hurried step, Loaded with wealth, the winnings of a night, Sweeps thro' the rooms, and cries out victory! Still not content, the gaming fury goads; More, more cries avariceâdo not quit the board Till all within this golden round be thine: The nymph obeysâindignant fortune shifts, And from the Cormorant turns her angry wheel, The last sad guinea trembles in her hand; To that the gorgeous watch, the costly toys, Rings, jewels, trinkets, in confusion gay, Seizes her lucky foe, and last of all The picture of her Lord;âthen home she hies, Loses the haughty air, the conqueror's pride, And like a guilty creature slinks to bed. But soft at this departing witching hour, Edging on midnight, who is that wild spark, His hair dishevell'd, and his spurs in blood Now entering on the game? with daring hand He ventures various purses on a card; The various purses, which so lightly came, As lightly disappear. Stern Fortune frowns; Enrag'd, th' adventurer starts and rushes forth, He mounts his ready steed, swift scours the road, And steals the fresh supply.âJustice pursues, The game is upâthe gallows ends the chace. Perils innumerous as leaves which fall From the decaying bough on Autumn's tide, Abuse and use, and wretchedness and joy, Alternate, mix'd, confounded, and convolv'd, From Cards, those engines of amusement, flow. From thence proceeds pale vigils, and dire dreams, The bad big word, the bitten lip, torn nail, The sullen look, the pout, and rude reply. The raving blasphemy, the broken vow, The little altercation, duel dire, The sigh deep-searching, and the groan profound. But turn the pictureâsee its fair reverse, There view the happier History of Cards, Thus in a lighter treasure glide along. When the time hangs heavy on us, Sol disdaining to shine on us, When the wintry welkin lowers, Or the rattling tempest pours, When the chilly wind is blowing, Or the drizzling wet is flowing, What like Cards defy the weather, Bringing neighbour friends together? Fix them all behind the screen, All around the verdent green, Now good fortune sweet surprizing Blithsome expectation rising, Gentle hope and gentle fear, But no baser passion near, Soft suspense, while you are dealing, I from you my luck concealing. Here the conquering Heart to bring, Which subdues your haughty King; Now in Diamonds rich abounding, Now your wily Knave confounding; Then our Spades turn up the scene, Then our Clubs knock down the Queen. What like Cards when thus we play, On a dark December day? What like Cards the hand can show, Or the arm of moving snow? What can bid the brightness rise, Or illume the female eyes? What so well the cheek can flush, Stir so quick the blooming blush? What when Books and Booklings tire, So can grace a friendly fire? Whist and Commerce, Loo and Ombre, Cheer away reflections sombre; Then the harmless joy to view, When I have better luck than you. If to win the game I'm able, Brisk I deal about the table; When the conquering Card I hold, Smart I throw it on the board; Honours then you know are mine, Yet my hand, my heart is thine; What like Cards, when thus we play, Help to pass dull life away? Keep within this prudent bound, And gayly let the deal go round. THERON: A TALE. Far from the fostring gale and sunny ray, Where Fortune's favourites on the downy lap Of Luxury are lull'd, and to repose Lur'd by the Syren song of flattering Hope, Twice sixteen winters with the world at war Had Theron liv'd. In each disastrous change, Whether like humble shrubs he trod the vale, And breath'd the balm of Solitude and Flowers, Woo'd the pale violet, or the primrose dress'd; Or driv'n from these, to climb the mountain's brow, Fame, to her perilous summit call'd his step, To seek the joys he found not in the glen, Misfortune followed as he mov'd along; Her sharp wind rais'd the tempest o'er his head, And from his sorrowing heart drove the sweet sleep That heals the soul, and medicines to its grief. Ill-fated Theron! in thy earliest time, When Health and Happiness, like Summer flowers, Are rich in colour and profuse in bloom, And blossoms cluster round Youth's vernal bower, When like the oak, some parents kindly hand Upon the tender plant he rears and loves, Branches protection, and defends from harm, Even then was Theron like the slender thorn Upon the desolate Heath, expos'd alone, An orphan of the Waste. No tender tear Of friend or kindred, nourishing as dew Bath'd the thin leaf that wither'd in his May, And yet he died not, yet his generous soul In native dignity withstood the storm, That bore full hard upon his gentle youth, And still the Poet's laurel grac'd his brow, And Love and Fame their glossy garlands wove To decorate his heart, and oft the sun Bestow'd, alas! a transitory beam, As lightning flashes while it strikes with death, In splendid ruin to adorn his fall. 'Twas at a soothing interval of fate, When no rude burst of passion on his soul Pour'd the keen sense of agony or joy, Arpasia caught his view:âmuch he admir'd, Admir'd, but lov'd not, for his heart had long Renounc'd the power that murders while it smiles. Guarded he met her eye, tho' arm'd with fire Bright as the flame that warms the breast of Heaven; Guarded he heard her speak, tho' eloquence, Wisdom, and wit, and honey'd accents flow'd From her ripe lip the gods might wish to press; She too, defended by the seven-fold shield Of former disappointment, stood the shock Of Love's full quiver in this new attack. Cloath'd thus in mail, the fierce encounter both Boldly essay'd, when lo! their weapons broke Short in their hands unfaithful, while the points Subtle and deep were striking in their hearts: Thus both were wounded by an equal blow, Both fought, both fell, while Love's insidious god Look'd smiling on, and triumph'd in his power. But ah! this strife was all in amity, And when the contest clos'd, their hands were join'd, Like two brave combatants whom love of arms, And zeal to save their country, led to war, Not conquerors but friends. Arpasia then Disclos'd the history of her heart, and read, Blotted by many a tear, the eventful page Of Theron's fortunes, of the mazy woes Which thro' the thorny labyrinth of life From year to year his bleeding feet had trod; How in the cradle, yet a babe, he found No mother's hand to rock him to repose, No mother's nurturing bosom to bestow A softer pillow than the cygnet's down; How Grief her palest lily in his cheek, Killing Health's wholesome rose ere it could blow, Sickly had set; how yet a harmless child He roam'd a pilgrim wanderer o'er the world; How the false friend his summer looks put on, When Fortune's partial sun-beams play'd around, But wore his winter features when the cloud Fell fast and pityless, and bore to earth The trembling Theron. In his storied woes, Reflected strong, Arpasia saw her own; She too her infant days pass'd with less joy Than doth the linnet in her waving nest, Which knows a parent's care; for no such care Cradled Arpasia, whose sad fate too much, Theron, resembled thine. Similitude severe! Yet from severe similitude proceeds The dearest sympathies and bonds of life. And oh! Adversity, thy sacred tie Unites thy votaries in a league more strong Than all the golden compacts of the world Form'd in a prosperous hour. Arpasia wept, And Theron's tears were ready in his eye To mix with hers, but they were April tears, Where sun-beams temper showers.â Two weary way-worn travellers they seem'd By hazard met, after a toilsome round Of sea and land, of forest and of fen, To pause a while under the self-same shade, Where entering on discourse they fondly tell Their mutual tale, and much delighted find Their wants, their wishes, and their griefs the same; Till having rested, both together rise, Together journey on with equal pace, Reck not the perils of the future road, Smile o'er the past, and swear to part no more. The rapid passion in Arpasia's heart Grew like the gathering flame in Theron's breast, And former loves (if they might loves be call'd, Which, like a gaudy feather on the stream, O'er the fair surface idly passes on) Died on the instant, as the taper's light Sudden expires, when Phospher's living ray Gems the rich zone of morn; yet, sad reverse! Arpasia sicken'd, on the day design'd To make her Theron happy:âAt her couch He stood, the herald of her languid eye, To watch its motion, to proclaim its wish, And spare the toil of speech. He fled from friends, From Fame's full clarion, and the golden lyre, To the lone chamber where Arpasia lay: And oh! the soft embrace, the speechless gaze, The tender pressure, and the silent tear; And lovelier than the rest, the speaking smile Of roseate health restor'd, that often paid, With usury of joy, his guardian care! âBegone! begone! tumultuous scenes,â he said, As swift he bore his treasure from the din Of city clamour to a cottage small, Where never villager or shepherd maid (Born to the plain, and in the vallies bred) Their rural life with more sequester'd step, More quiet pass'd the smooth domestic day, Than Theron with Arpasiaâ And yet 'was drear December, not a bower (Such as romantic Love in his retreat Desires) was blooming near:âA simple spot Clad in its robe of winter. Yet by Fancy's power Spring's sweetest children seem'd to deck the soil; She bade her woodbines and her roses blow, And call'd her fairest sun-beams from the sky Herself created, to illume the scene, And suckle every flower;âwhere Love resides, There revels constant summer, there the trees Assume perennial verdure, and the gale (Tho' frozen Boreas sheds his mildew round) Drops balm and odour from his viewless wing. Thrice happy Theron, and thrice bless'd Arpasia! Close to each other drawn, the mutual heart, The mutual pleasure, and the mutual pain, Was here unfolded; here was ratified, Approv'd, confirm'd, and sign'd, Love's golden bond: And his consenting eye, whose raging winds Had tore their early hopes, appear'd at length To bless and to support two drooping flowers, Transplanted safe into a happier soil Where the rude elements could vex no more. But ah! how oft is Summer's fairest eve, Where scarce the breathing zephyr stirs the leaf Of rose or myrtle, by the thunder follow'd? Even while the tender tints of setting day Paint the horizon, and the dew descends In silent blessing on the bathing flowers, Broods the embowell'd mischief: loud it rolls And rends the mournful mantle of the night. Thus false, thus faithless, was the transient calm That shone on Theron's and Arpasia's sky: To the seductive world once more they went, And at the threshold of their cot, alas! They left Content, and Happiness, and Heav'n, Cover'd with laurels, from the northern shore, A blooming hero came, Arpasia's friend, Arpasia's lover, whom the deathful din Of constant action in the sanguine field, And months of weary march, and years of toil, Estrang'd not from the maid, whose soverign eye Gilded his path to glory. Soon as peace Sent her white doves to close the scene of blood And bear the branching olive, swift the youth Hasted to Albion's shore, and anxious sought The hoarded treasure of his virgin heart. He sought and found her on the fatal day, She parted from her Theron; parted soon To meet again. And tho' Arpasia ne'er Had lov'd Sophronius (so the youth was call'd) As women love, who give the maiden heart In dear exchange of passion, glad she saw A tender friend, escap'd from ruthless war Return'd with honour to his native land, The land he had defended: and her tears Mix'd with her chaste embraces. Theron then Quick hastening to Arpasia, instant saw Rapture that weeps, and blushes that denote The heart's strong triumph at a treasure sav'd From the devouring war. Her heart he knew Lodg'd in his own true bosom, yet he feared, (Fear still is Love's attendant) that the joy Thron'd in her eye, and from her rubied lip Pouring the ardent welcome, might, perchance, Nourish a dangerous softness, yet he prais'd Her generous warmth and join'd the glowing zeal. But when the youth, beneath the self-same roof, With supplication strong to be receiv'd, A chosen guest entreated, and his suit Incautious friendship granted, who can draw The pangs that seiz'd on Theron? Many a day He fed in silence on his master griefs, And bath'd his lonely pillow with his tears, Far from Arpasia's mansion: Ev'ry friend, Save she who cou'd administer relief, Appear'd with comfort in their looksâwhile she, (Cold as the marble that receives the drops Of some pale mourner, at the urn which holds The sainted ashes of the maid he lov'd) Remain'd untouched, and while forlorn he lay Death-sick beneath the chill of her neglect, Sophronius was her theme. His health, his fame, His rising fortune, and reward in arms, Flam'd from her pen, which courted Theron's Muse, To blazon forth his prowess in the war, His fair deserts in peace. Yet still she talk'd Of Friendship's early bonds, and nam'd not Love, Nor seem'd to know the madness and despair That rag'd in Theron's bosom, but led on By Pity's gentle handâfor from the youth, From change of climate, from fatigues of war, And the heart's tender tumult, growing still, That gently Pity claim'd, which the kind fair (Without a thought that wrong'd the spotless faith, Plighted to Theron) gave, with soul sincere; Theron meanwhile believ'd it Love, fond Love enthron'd Upon the mutual heart, and mad'ning thence, Exclaim'd, infuriateââYes! they both shall fall! âSince Pity thus can light her savage torch, âAnd bind upon her altar, Love himself, âLove in his turn, shall boast a sacrifice, âAnd mark for death his victim!â Strait he rose, 'Twas the deep noon of night, he strode along, A poignard snatch'd, and as he reach'd the dome Of his Arpasia; soften'd at the view From his torn heart these mournful accents broke: âOh had the chance been Theron's, had some maid, âBright as the morning star, her virgin heart âLaid in the circle of these courted arms, âAnd breath'd a passion warmer than e'er touch'd âThe breast of woman, tho' Compassion's sigh, âThe tenderest tear that ever Pity shed, âThe truest throb that ever Friendship knew âMight plead his cause, nor these, nor death itself, âShou'd shake his plighted faith to false Arpasia, âShou'd shake his faith, ah no! by yonder heav'n âNot the bright synod of the Gods shou'd draw âHis settled heart aside, tho' to the power âOf heav'nly beauty, gold shou'd add a charm âRicher than proud Golconda.â Scarce these words Burst from his heart, e'en from the opening door Rush'd forth, with hurrying step and troubled air, Some one infolded in a thick disguise, That needed scarce the darkness of the night To mock discovery. Theron, at the view Sudden retir'd unseen, and torpid stood A few sad moments; then, with frantic haste PursuedâAh, hell-born Jealousy! Thou child of Love, Performing deeds more terrible than hate! From shadows thinner than the fleeting night That floats along the vale, or haply seems To wrap the mountain in its hazy vest, (Which the first sun-beam dissipates in air.) How dost thou conjure monsters which ne'er mov'd But in the chaos of thy frenzied brain! Thence hurling frighted Reason from her throne, And with her all the charities that wait To grace her virtuous Court! Theron soon O'ertook whom he pursu'd, nor doubting ought, (For Jealousy allows no pause of sense). It was his happy rival, rais'd his hand, In which the poignard trembled, and in rage, To madness, struck the bosom ofâArpasia! Yes! 'twas Arpasia's self. The faithful mistress, from her lover's arm, Thus met her fate utimely, for e'er word, Cou'd utterance find, the dagger in her breast Transfix'd she foundââAnd hast thou kill'd me, Love?â âWas all she spoke, then died in his embrace. Upon her Theron's brow pale Horror sate, âKill thee!â he criedâthen deep into his heart Plung'd the fell blade, with poor Arpasia's blood, Distain'd and reekingâagoniz'd he fell And kiss'd the woundâexpiring in her arms. MISCELLANEOUS VERSES. THE ROSE-TREE, THE GARDENER, AND THE SHRUBS. TO HER GRACE THE DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE With the Author's Works collected into Volumes. A rose-tree, exquisitely fair, With sweets embalm'd the passing air: In vermeil tints and tender dyes, It match'd the blush of morning skies, And soft beneath its shade was found A shelter for the flow'rets round; The humblest primrose of the dale There sought a refuge from the gale; For vain the ruder storms oppose What's shelter'd by this lovely Rose; And vain shall gusts of envy blow, Where Shrubs in soft protection grow. A Gard'ner leaning on his spade By chance this lovely Rose survey'd, And oh! said he, how oft with toil These hands have till'd Parnassian soil; How oft Poetic ground I've trod, Obedient to the Muses nod; How long have thrown my plants about, Till scarce I find the nurselings out! 'Tis time that all were rang'd together, And safely fenc'd from wind and weather; For ill they brook the public storm, And ask some southern aspect warm. But scatter'd thus in wild disorder, Without the safe-guard of a border, They seem like Briars by the road To want a visible abode, And stand expos'd to every thief Who strips the Laurel of its leaf. Now yonder Rose that looks so fair, Ah! my poor plants that ye might share Such shelter; and tho' weak ye be, How would you thrive near yonder tree? The gen'rous Rose-Tree bloom'd consent, And to his task our Gard'ner went; And tho' faint Pinks and Field Flow'rs wild And useless Furze the wreath compil'd, A fancy Lilac fring'd with Rhyme, Hawthorn and variegated Thyme, With here and there of Bays a sprig, A Cypress bough and Myrtle twig, Mixt with full many a weed that grows, Where'er a mortal flow'ret blows. Still the fair Rose-Tree smil'd benign, As guardian goddess of the scene, And the slight Garland which he plann'd, Accepted from our Gard'ner's hand. UPON THE CONNEXION OF THE AUTHOR WITH TWO FRIENDS OF GREAT EMINENCE IN LITERATURE. While ye, the planets of sublimer size, Form your bright empire in fair Friendship's skies; While to each others orb approaching near, Co-heirs of light, ye rule the glowing sphere; While darkling mortals scarce endure the rays, And feed their famish'd tapers at your blaze, May my faint starâjust travell'd into sightâ Reflect soft lustre from your guardian light; Full in the front of Heav'n, while ye shall shine, Some part, less honour'd, yet in view be mine. Remote and trembling, tho' my star must gleam, Your Friendship lends a glory to the beam. TO DOCTOR LETTSOM, WRITTEN IN A BLANK LEAF OF THE AUTHOR'S WORKS. To thee my best Physician and my friend, This varied garland of the Muse I send; Her different powers to thee by right belong, Thou âmaster of the poet and the song:â Oft as I droop'd beneath the toil of thought, Thy skilful hand the balm restoring brought; And while thy converse sooth'd my sinking heart, That skilful hand reliev'd the mortal part; O take the wreathe then which thy patient wove, O take the tribute of the Muse you love! TO Mrs. SIDDONS's CHILDREN, SUGGESTED BY SEEING THEM DRAWN IN THE SAME PICTURE. How shall I bribe you, pretty creatures, Your harmless pastimes to suspend? Say, do you wish fair minds as features? Then let the Poet be your friend. A moment spare to read his verses, Where fondness glows and truth appears; Bards can't put money in your purses, But they may save a thousand tears. Ah! learn betimes to taste the pleasure Domestic love alone can give; Resolve, since Heaven allows the treasure, A brother's, sister's life to live. Still, Henry, as in yonder picture, Let Sally hang upon your arm; There of your duty see the stricture, And let the breathing canvass warm. And when, for this world's sounding rattles, Or the gilt toys which Fortune sends, Ye are dispos'd to little battles, Look at the Picture, and be friends. Trust me, dear ones, not a bauble, Which this painted world can show, Can deserve a moment's squabble, Can deserve a moment's woe. Serious pains enough, believe me, Fall in life's uneven road; These sufficiently will grieve ye; Children, add not to the load. Needless, needless, such distressing; Sweet ones, act a wiser part; Still yon Picture hints a blessing; Oh! improve the Painter's art, Sally, you, as bound in duty, Ev'ry softer debt should pay; Harry's strength shall guard your beauty, He must rule, and you obey. See the oak that crowns the meadow, Tow'rs majestic from the ground; See the woodbine courts its shadow, Wreathing firm its arms around. Next behold yon myrtle blowing, Shelter'd by the lordly pine; Like that pine is Harry growing; Gentle maid, the myrtle's thine. Then, my dears, your anxious mother, Down whose cheeks the fond tears stray, Shall bless the sister, bless the brother, While ye kiss those tears away. To each other oft repairing, Fate and fortune both shall brave; Till death your joys and sorrows sharing, Forming that Picture in the grave. THE OPENING OF THE NINTH BOOK OF THE HENRIADE TRANSLATED The Autor when in France was introduced to M. de Voltaire, who requested he would turn into English verse a few lines of his Henriade. These verses underwritten were attempted in consequence.. On the fair confines of Idalia's shore. Where Europe ends, and Asia opes her store, Love's ancient palace rears its rev'rend head, Whose rich foundations were by Nature laid; Whose beauteous structure, Art, her rival, grac'd With finest touches of peculiar taste. There, all the charming neighbourhood around, Perpetual summer paints the smiling ground. To wave the myrtle, and to woo the rose, The tender South is all the gale that blows; Sun, without cloud, exerts a fostering power, The clime to suckle in eternal flower. Pomona triumphs o'er her burnish'd bough, And Terra asks no profits from the plough; Superior Nature smiles at Mortal aid, And spurns alike the sickle and the spade. Spontaneous harvests glad the roving sight, And peace and plenty urge to soft delight. Here, once again, the times of gold appear, And every charm, butâInnocence is here; No jarring jargon of a world at strife Pervades the am'rous languishments of life, But touching airs, which harmony inspires, Trill to the softness of a thousand lyres; A thousand lovers tune the tender voice, And, amiably weak, defend their choice; The blest enthusiasts drown the sense of wrong In the sweet chorus of th' impassion'd song. Fresh wreaths of rose their fragrant fronts adorn, From Flora's bosom pillag'd every morn; Half-naked Graces near the Temple stand, To add new converts to Love's happy land; Or else repos'd on beds of rising flowers, In touching silence try their various powersâ The care that melts, the tender breathing sigh, The whisp'ring wish, the pleasure-moving eye, The anxious hope, the tear that tells desire. The smile of frolic, and the blush of fire. THE CASKET. TO A FRIEND UNDER PAIN FROM A FEW POINTED OBSERVATIONS. The Casket of Friendship is fair to behold, With spangles of silver and studdings like gold, The surface is fillagree'd o'er with such care, The Graces themselves were the artists you'd swear; So bright to the eye, and so smooth to the feel, It glows like a mirror of well polish'd steel; Yet nothing so brittle in nature or art, Unless it within holds the gem of the heart; Unless the fair jewel of truth is there hid, And the hand of sincerity opens the lid. Thou and I, my dear Mary, this diamond have seen, Allow'd it is splendid, confess'd it is keen, Its wonderful double properties often have found, Severely to cut, and then shine on the wound; Yet deep tho' the puncture, and potent the smart, Too pure is the temper to fester the heart, The balm of affection soon softens the pain, And we wish the kind weapon to wound us again; Yet thou, my lov'd Mary, hast little to fear, For seldom the brilliant shall cost thee a tear! 'Twill oft on thy virtues transcendently shine, And reflect from their brightness a ray more divine, And if at thy foibles it strike now and then, Where THOU suffer'st for one,âI shall suffer for ten! WRITTEN EXTEMPORE ON RECEIVING A LOCKET. Precious gift! O may'st thou rest, Dear associate of my breast! Happy shall I, Clara, be, Thus possessing part of thee! While affection fond as fair, Forms a chain of every hair, A chain, which round the willing mind, Sensibility shall bind. TO MISS SAWBRIDGE. PRESENTED WITH EMMA CORBETT, FROM THE AUTHOR. Sweet Anna! In these mournful pages see, All that the Muse can wish may meet in thee; Be thou, like Emma, fam'd for tender truth, Like Henry constant be thy favour'd youth; Yet may thy Henry in thy Fathers cause, Stand forth the champion of insulted laws; Like patriot Edwards' be thy Hero's heart, And should he fall, be thine Louisa's part; Like Raymond, should'st thou e'er a lover find, To hapless passion be like Emma kind; Pity the fondness sighs alone reveal, And gently soothe the wounds thou can'st not heal, Obey, like Emma, all that faith requires, And dare, like her, avow what Heav'n inspires; But, ah may here the wish'd resemblance end, And on thy fortunes happier fates attend, Never sweet Anna, never mayst thou prove, Her bleeding trials of unshaken love! ADVERTISEMENT. THE enchanting Copies of Verses which follow, by Mrs. Sheridan and another Lady, were deservedly admired by the public at the time of their appearance, and struck the Author of these Miscellanies so forcibly, that he soon after wrote the replies which are added to each; and as they were all re-published in most of the periodical and diurnal prints together, it is hoped the writers of the Poems, will excuse the liberty he has taken of prefixing them to the answers in this Collection. MRS. SHERIDAN ON HER BROTHER'S LYRE. âSweet instrument of him for whom I mourn, âTuneful companion of my Lycid's hours! âHow liest thou neglected and forlorn, âWhat skilful hand shall now call forth thy powers! âAh! none like his can reach those liquid notes, âSo soft, so sweet, so eloquently clear, âTo live beyond the touch, and gently float âIn dying modulations on the ear.â Thus o'er my Lycid's lyre as I complain'd, And kiss'd the strings where he was wont to play, While yet in pensive sadness I remain'd, Methought it sigh'd, and sighing seem'd to say, âAh! me, forlorn, forsaken, now no more Shall fame and just applause around me wait; No power my gentle master can restore, And I, alas! will share his hapless fate. âFled is that spirit, chill'd that youthful fire, Which taught those strains with harmony replete, And cold that hand which only can inspire My senseless form to utter sounds so sweet. âThose sounds melodious ne'er again shall please, No tuneful strain from me shall ever flow; Save o'er my trembling strings a sighing breeze, To call one sad, soft note of tender woe. âElse, ah! for ever mute let me remain, Unstrung, untun'd, forgotten let me be; Guard me from curious eye, and touch prophane, And let me rest in mournful sympathy! âOne fate, with thee, dear Master, let me share Like thee in silent darkness let me lie! My frame without thee is not worth my care, With thee alone it liv'd, with thee shall die!â HER BROTHER's LYRE TO MRS. SHERIDAN. This saidâa solemn silence breath'd around, Cecilia wept upon her Lycid's lyre, The pensive breeze then gave a sighing sound, And the strings seem'd to tremble and expire. One hollow murmur, like the dying moan, Was heard to vibrate then, with pauses slow, From the sad instrument, when thus the tone Gave modulations of a softer woe. âCease, beauteous mourner! partner of my grief! Tuneful associate of my last despair, Thou, only thou, can'st bring this breast relief; Thy sympathy alone can soothe my care. âWhat thoughâah, stroke severe! our Lycid's dead, No more, alas! can ravish mortal ear; What though the soul of melody is fled, His blest attendant to th' harmonious sphere, âStruck by Cecilia's hand I yet may live; Her magick touch again can tune my frame; Her cherub voice my spirit yet revive, And sounds of heavenly sorrow grace my fame. âBut should nor dulcet song, nor music's art, Nor social sighs, which mourn the youth we love, Have power to heal the sister's wounded heart, Nor to these chords forlorn a solace prove: âAh! still together let our sorrows join, And this sad form yet boast thy gentle aid; Lycid's companion sure should still be thine; Still should'st thou kiss the strings where he has play'd.â LINES, BY A LADY, ON SEEING SOME WHITE HAIRS ON HER LOVER'S HEAD. Thou to whose pow'r reluctantly we bend, Foe to life's fairy dreams relentless time, Alike the dread of lover and of friend; Why stamp thy seal on manhood's rosy prime, Already twining 'midst my Thyrsis' hair, The snowy wreaths of age, the monuments of care. Thro' all her forms tho' nature owns thy sway, That boasted sway thou'lt here exert in vain To the last beam of life's declining day; Thyrsis shall view unmov'd thy potent reign, Secure to please while goodness knows to charm, Fancy and taste delight, and sense and truth inform. Tyrant, when from that lip of crimson glow, Swept by thy chilling wing the rose shall fly; When thy rude scythe indents his polish'd brow, And quench'd is all the lustre of his eye: When ruthless age disperses ev'ry grace, Each smile that beams from that enchanting face. Then thro' her stores shall active mem'ry rove, Teaching her various charms to bloom anew, And still the raptur'd eye of hopeless love Shall bend on Thyrsis its delighted view; Still shall he triumph with resistless pow'r, Still rule the conquer'd heart to life's remotest hour. TIME's ANSWER. Sweet flow thy numbers, Oh! ingrateful fair, And tuneful error marks thy polish'd rhyme But know tho' mine to give the silver hair, 'Twas thy own Thyrsis, beg'd the boon of time; Thyrsis high glowing yet in manhood's hour, Who prematurely sought an earnest of my pow'r, Mov'd by his pray'r those wintry wreaths I wove, Twisting my snow-drops with the rose of youth; But still 'twas Thyrsis's gentle fraud to prove, His Daphne's friendship, and his Daphnes truth: âOh! strew thy partial whitness (thus he said) âOh let thy snowy symbols strait invest my head! âSo shall I see, if chill'd by thy advance, âShe with life's summer moment's shall recede; âSo shall I see, if with youth's fleeting glance, âFrom age's menace, Daphne too shall speed; âSo shall I triumph if I find the fair, âDefy the snowy wreaths, the monuments of Care.â Then wherefore tyrant? Fair ingrate 'tis mine, When falls man's short-liv'd blossom of an hour To touch affection with a bloom divine, And proud expand truth's never-dying flower, To lift fair constancy to seats sublime, E'en 'bove myself, above the pow'rs of time, Ah! then let mem'ry and the Muses know, Thou lovely satyrist shouldst bless my reign; My pow'rs alone could deathless charms bestow, Which prov'd the fondness that inspir'd thy strain; Since but for those white omens of my sway, The world had wanted Daphne's faithful lay. TO MISS C. BRACKENBURY, OF COPT-FOLD-HALL, IN ESSEX. Invoking Fortune yet losing the Raffle. As Fortune from her birth was blind, We should not call the dame unkind, When worth and beauty she forsakes, We ought to pity her mistakes; That ladies lose what coxcombs win, Is more her sorrow than her sin; And tho' she show'rs her favours down On blockheads, who deserve her frown; On Pride bestows a coach and six, And plays a thousand silly tricks; To Folly gives the prosp'ring gale, Neglecting Wisdom in the vale; Mounts Vice upon her golden throne, While cottag'd Virtue weeps alone, At random lends a title here, Refusing ev'ry honor there. Now gives the knave a lucky hit, Plumps the dull rogue and starves the wit, Tho' 'tis confess'd she ev'ry hour Discovers some abuse of power; And tho' she blunder'd yester night, What doth it prove, but want of sight? Poor Goddess! could she but have seen, Her Brackenbury's ardent mein, Th' impassion'd glow, the anxious air, That guard the hope illumin'd fair; O had she but the gift of eyes None else had born away the prize! Perhaps, in wisdom, 'tis design'd The Goddess should continue blind; Fortune and Love restor'd to sight, What mischief had been done last night, Both had resign'd their wheels and darts, And gain'd their eyesâto lose their hearts. TO THE SAME, WITH THE FEMALE FABLES. Fit gift for widow, maid, and wife, Accept these rules of female life, Where Fiction lends new charms to Truth, Combining both, as friends to youth; The duty of your sex behold, By birds, and beasts, and flow'rets told, Here insects preach like sound divines, Each tree a tree of knowledge shines. A lesson for the coxcomb's heart, The flirting sparrow shall impart; The tender turtle and the bee, Shall murmur love and industry; In the lamb's bleat you'll precepts find To shun the wolves of human kind; The generous horse will nobly show, What with your flatterers you should do; The glow worms of your sex how vain, You learn from Philomela's strain; The serious owl, and simple goose, Harangue in verse for female use; And the young lion bids you 'scape All friendship with the human ape, And every leaf and every bower Unfolds a salutary power, While all with one loud voice declare, What women should beâwhat you are. A SILFPHID's GREETING, CARRIED BY ZEPHIR TO DR. DELACOUR, On Miss Fanny Gould's Recovery from a dangerous Illness. From yon lucid realms of light, Delacour to thee I write, Zephir shall the greeting bear Little minister of air. Zephir, blest youth, from whose nectarious wing Drops the soft odours of immortal spring, Smooth then should the numbers be, Worthy Zephir, worthy me, Worthy of the healing art, Worthy Fanny's grateful heart. Haste then, fair Gale, to Delacour below, Fly to the friend to whom my life I owe, For yonder Silph, the Queen of all our band, Thus gave, at Fanny's birth, the dread command. Subject Silphidetta come, Mark, Oh! mark my favourite fair, Thine to nurse her infant bloom, Little guardian of her star: Subject Silphid, hear at large All the duties of thy charge: I. Viewless, hov'ring o'er her pillow, Leave her not to Elf or Gnome, Be thy post of honour near her, Be her tender breast thy home. II. Every Silph, and every Silphid, Should preside o'er Fanny's birth; For of Silphid race already She our sister seems on earth. III. Guard her then high favour'd spirit, But, Oh! if she slighted be, Woe upon the sprite detested, How shall Ariel punish thee! She said, and trembling to my charge I went, And o'er her tender frame my bosom bent; Then as a curtain every feather drew, And chid Favonius when too brisk he blew. In her I saw a second self arise, And left my sunbeam for her eyes, I triumph'd in the allotted fair, And Ariel smil'd upon my care. But sickness, Fay abhorr'd, a demon born, Struck my sweet ward in Nature's orient morn, With him, on flagging pinion, Languor came, Theirs was the crime, but mine, alas! the blame. In vain I flew around the bed, The Gnome decreed the nymph should die, In vain my feathers were outspread, In vain I heard the Silphid sigh. With grief and rage our Queen beheld the sight, Wept o'er the maid, and banish'd me from light, âThen, Oh! in rage, she cried, false Silphid come, âEternal darkness by thy wretched doom!â Now dusky Umbriel fix'd me in a mill, Where but for thee I had been whirling still, Transfix'd by needles, gor'd by corking pins, The hapless victim of another's sins; But hail, all hail to him who sav'd my fair, And gave these wings the liberty of air. Happiest Silphid now on high, O'er my Fanny safe I fly, On her lip again I sit, Breathing fragrance, breathing wit, Sport around her rosy cheek, Where I fix my lodging sleek. A brighter orb is given me in the sky And in a richer couch of light I lie, Silphs, Fays, and Fairiesâall the host of air, For Fanny's sake do homage to my star, Ah! borrow'd honoursâfor tho' paid to me, Friend of her lifeâthey all belong to Thee! But hark I hear Favonins' wings, He from our Queen a greeting brings; Lovely south wind!âlist! he speaks, Softly as when morning breaks: âDescended from my native sky âA Heav'nly messenger am I; âSwift from fluid fields above, âI bear a Queen's immortal love, âWho summon'd me in yonder Heav'n, âWhere this tender charge was giv'n; âSwift as thought, oh gentle breeze, âTraverse air and earth and seas, âTo Delacour this greeting take, âFly for thy Queens, and Fanny's sake.â This said a billet to my breast she tied And bade th' obedient air divide; On duty's rapid wing I flew, Thro' blooming realms of other blue; I fixed on earth, and reach'd the door, Sacred to health, and Delacour; The guard, Hygea, stood confess'd, And took the billet from my breast: âHere gentle Gale, thy task may end, âThe Doctor is my dearest friend; âWe are in partnership you know, âAnd practise physic here below; âThy fair commission deftly done, âExpand thy plumage to the sun, âOr by the margin of our stream âBreathe Southern Coolness o'er his beam; âOr as thou fliest our hills among, âShed fragrance as thou mov'st along.â The Goddess ceas'dâI blew a balmy kiss, Then sent from Clifton's airy summit this: Whene'er Hygea, Sir, or you Wish a fair wind, I comeâAdieu. THE TWO LEECHES TO MRS. CLUTTERBUCK. On Chlora's temples, agoniz'd with pain, The Doctors tried their art, but tried in vain; Long they disputed about cold and heat, The pang increasing whilst they fix its seat; Some said 'twas from the teeth, some from the head, Some counsell'd air, and some advis'd a bed: This man of medicene shew'd a Sovereign Bill, That gave a drop which conquer'd every ill; Cold water one, another brandy hot, Ten swore 'twas rheumatism, ten swore not; Nostrums infalliable by loads she swallow'd, But not one drop of promis'd comfort follow'd; Drug, blister, bolus, lotion, potion, draught, All things but ease the learned sages brought. At length, unsluice rare beauties crimson tide, Lovers of blood, two Leeches were applied; The happy creatures, conscious of the place, Sport round the regions of her charming face: Now press the roses bleeding on her cheek, Now in the lillies of her beauteous neck; Their jelly lips luxuriously they steep, And to the confines of her bosom creep, There, where the whole Sorbonne might wish to rest, They spot with blood the snow drop on her breast: Thence to the fiery elements they rise And madly dare the sun-beams of her eyes, Presumptuous grown, hear those they fix at last, But soon repent them of the rich repast. From Chlora's cheek the fatal nectar came, From Chlora's eyes shot forth the fatal flame; Lovesick and blind at last they yield their breath, Drank deep, look'd long, and tasted certain death; Such streams, such fires unable to endure, They fell by Chlora, yet were Chlora's cure; Lovers beware, nor rashly come too nigh, Nor hope to live where sanguine leeches die. THE PASSION FLOWER TO MIRA. Behold yon charming flow'r my fair, Mira may find a moral there! Expanding to the orb of day, As if enamour'd of its ray; It lives but in the sunny glow, And nourish'd thence the blossom's blow. Thus, Mira, of thy kindness born, Love seem'd a rose without a thorn Delighted in this breast it grew, Owing each vermeil tint to you: My heart confess'd thy genial pow'r; Thy smile, like sunshine to the flow'r. But see how fades the flow'r away With the last tinge of parting day; Its glossy colour instant flies, Extinct are all its thousand dies. Thus, Mira, thy diminish'd pow'r, Still bears allusion to the flow'r; Tho' love's soft gales were in thy sighs And all his sunshine in thine eyes, That love withdrawn which one possessed, And reign'd th' enthusiast of thy breast; Farewell to all that gave it birth, And, like the Sun, remov'd from earth; No more I own thy beauty's pow'r, For thou hast kill'd the Passion Flow'r. ACREONTIC BURLESQUE. TO MR. MURRAY. Friend to the wish'd enlarg'd, and flowing bowl, Thou genuine son, Of old Anacreon, Thus let the muse address thy social soul: Spirit of Horace, swift attend; Poet of jollity, descend: Oh come, ye vine-crown'd pow'rs, which Comus lends To all his nectar-quaffing friends! Ever joyous, ever gay, When on some potation day, The rosy godhead takes the chair, And drowns in seas of drink, the fiend Despair. 'Tis then the mantling cup, allays the lover's smart, And pours a sweet oblivion on the merry heart: Then Grief, and pining Care, and haggard Pain Hang their dejected heads in conscious shame, The foes of Joy have caught the sound, And not a sigh is heard around: Dark-brow'd Melancholy steals away, As spectres fly the dawning day: Low'ring Discontent is gone, As clouds avoid the rising sun. Then come, thou Goddess, ever free, Offspring of humanity, Come fair hospitality, Thee I invoke, I kneel to thee! Let fair Good nature grace thy side, And blythsome Joy, thy blooming bride; Enamour'd of thy Murray's name, Thee I invoke, seraphic dame! Oh sing, the boundless wishes of his mind Extending wide, the bumper to mankind; Oh sing, how all that flinches, he disdains, How scorns the miser's muddling gains. While foe to all that's low or mean, Even in the tide of jollity, Where strongly flows festivity, Sense guides the current, and corrects the scene. Or if, perchance, a luckless wight, Unequal to the liquid sight, High sprung by Mirth, should haply reel, And topple from the head to heel: If he should grow supremely wise, And things dance double in his eyes, Soon as the vanquish'd hero's down, Murray declares he shall not drown; But, in sad pity to his puny head, The victor sends the conquer'd corpse to bed. There, in Lethean slumbers bury'd deep, The flushing warrior wooes the power of sleep, Repairs his lossâwakes dry in every vein, And loudly calls for Murray, and Champaign. The soldier thus, in heat of wars, Sunk by the forceful fall to ground, Soon as recover'd from his scars, E'er well the smart has left the wound, Again he rages for the glorious fray, Blazes again in arms, and wins the well-fought day. Yon pillars mark the festive dome, Where all the free a welcome find; There, is the season'd head at home, And in each glass shines out the master's mind. Drink deep, and quaff pleasure, No mixture, no measure; All the lovers of wine, Seize the goblet and join: Forget in yon mansion the dull cares of life, The Flask be your mistress, the Bottle your wife, Yet some there are no easy entrance gain, Slaves that disgrace his door, Shall never enter more, But meet the Gods magnanimous disdain, Let not the milksop come, But sip his tea at home; Let not the silken fop be there, But take with pale-fac'd Miss the air; Unless, perchance, the sons of wine, Full of frolic, wit, and whim, Shall meditate some arch design, To take the Petit-maitre in. Then waggish Momus shakes each younthful side, As the smug coxcomb sits in powder'd pride. For lo the president in state, Drenches the snowy pate: At first the fop, with caution drinks; The toasts go round with nods and winks: Soon grows the maccaroni flush'd, You'd swear his maiden sister blush'd; A general hectic shakes his head, And down he falls among th' inglorious dead. His silver vestments sweep the various ground; His curls, disorder'd, in the splash are drown'd; Paint, perfumes, patches, stain the Fopling o'er; And all the happy Table's in a roarâ: Thus, when the gilded butterfly, Array'd in Summer's silken trim, On pots of treacle casts its eye, And sips the sweets upon the brim. The honey'd coxcomb fluttering round, Pleas'd with the taste, now ventures round, The yielding bottom limes his feet; No fop e'er died a death more sweet: His mealy wings, and glossy coat, His shining back, and downy throat, Blacken'd and stain'd, alas, now mixes with the stream. But soft a while!âmethinks I hear Friendship's note assail the ear: Loud and sincere from joys rebound, I hear the mingled mirth go round. Come, then, muse, and pen, begone! Come, Thalia, and be gay, Meet our young Anacreon, Ripe as June, and blythe as May: Leave sober sadness, and the world behind, And meet thy Murray, with a Murray's mind. A PORTRAIT. In the manner of Swift. A vacant visage, bursting red; A paralitic shake of head: A paunch, brimful of various meats; Impregnate with intestine heats, Of bak'd and boil'd, all helter skelter, Sore driv'n by stress of wind and weather. A double range of yellow bone, Where fat of oxen chew'd, goes down, Even till it swims in that red sea Y'Clpt the gulp of gluttony; A hoarse, harsh voice, whose lightest sounds, Seems from some cavern under ground, A capon's gill, a collop'd chin, With flesh that swells the tighten'd skin; Bowels, which look a rood about, As ripe to split and wamble out; An atlas back of human brawn; A mouth into a swines-snout drawn; An eye that fixes in its socket Faster than binding bars could lock it; A squabby neck, a roomy chest; A more than mountains monstrous breast; Sinewsâoh Herculus like thine! God keep them from this frame of mine! A thigh, of column'd dome the type, A fistâsave, save me from its gripe! A wig that veils the shaven scull! A wig of one vast Nothing full; A bottomâHeav'n our chairs befriend! Be ours, unlikeâhis latter end. A LOVER'S QUARREL. IN THE MANNER OF PRIOR. At length the angry Chloe swore, With Strephon she would talk no more; At this the swain, as stout as she, No more would angry Chloe see; Both rose to part, then sat them down, While now they smile, and now they frown; On Jove they call'd to bind the oath, While Cupid slily laught at both. Jove ask'd the reason of the 'fray? âOnly two simpletoms at play, âCries Cupid, with my bow and arrows; âAnon they'll bill like doves and sparrows, âYour Godship knows, when lovers swear âTh' unmeaning vows disperse in air, âNay, more my Lord, well you and I know, âYou break them off with Madam Juno;â Jove shook his sides, and mildly said, âChild, put the silly things to bed, âAnd if they there must make a rout, âDo you stand byâand see it out.â</field>
