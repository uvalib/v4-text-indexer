      <field name="fulltext">THE CAPTIVE CAPTAIN: OR, The Restrained Cavaliere. IN VIII. CHARACTERS. CHOICE CABINET COUNSEL. Aperiatur Scrinium, Ut reperiatur Consilium. Proclus. Sperate Miseri, Cavete Fœlices. What precious treasures best inrich the mind, Vnlock this Cabinet, and you shall find. Gemms may be stoln, or lustre lose with rust; But these more pure than to resolve to dust. VIII. The restrained Cavaliere, with his Melancholy Fancy. [Didst thou but know, dogg'd Jaylor, whom thou hast] Didst thou but know, dogg'd Jaylor, whom thou hast In those vast jaws of thy damp Prison plac't; With cheerful rays thou'dst look upon thy guest, And hold thy Mansion by his seizure blest. Pure Nectar Rivolets drain'd from our brains Like Aqua fortis shall eat through thy chains. Grumble not, Island Curr! Here is a man Would hook thy Nose, were't thou Leviathan. Wits sleight restraint! our Spirits never felt Cares of those keys hang dangling at thy belt. [A Captive-Captain lay in such a room] A Captive-Captain lay in such a room, He held his Bed the Embleme of his Tombe. Dark as a Charnel-house: no spirit did move But Rats and Mice below, and rain above: So as he need't not wash his Couch with tears, Such streaming showrs drill'd down about his ears. Besides, an Herd of grunting Hoggs so nigh, None could discern his Lodging from their Stye. A kennel too of bawling Curs lay there, Which all night long were yelping in his ear. Near this a chimney that would keep no fire; “Thus did his passive pensive hours expire. “If this a thraldom might not stiled be, “Prisons are Paradoxes unto me. A QUEST of INQUIRY, Without hope of RECOVERY. Where's now your Burleygh, Cicil, Walsingham, Brave Furbisher, Drake, Hawkins, Nottingham? Their hush't in Clay. These that your Isle affords Are Silken-Civet-comfet-Curtain-Lords, Brisk-cringing Senatonrs as Apius was, Who spent the Morn in courting of his Glass. A REPLY. Hold Critick, hold;—We have as gallant men For Valour and brave Discipline as then. Take a Survey of our Victorious Fleet, With which should Neptune with his Convoy meet, They'd veil their Top-Sails, shouting, let's give room, “St. George with his stout Myrmidons are come “To Scour the Seas; 'twere fitting we gave way “When Regents of the Ocean bear sway. How pale does Tethis look, fearing to be Made Captive to our glorious Soveraignty? A Navy more magnanimous never came To slice the surface of the Ocean. Steered by expert Mariners; th' Event Must needs prove prosperous when High Descent Co-centre with brave spirits:—This will take, And make a greater State than Holland shake. Eye those renowned Dukes, winged with youth, With what deep scorn they look on Carpet slouth! They'r all Elyxir'd in their vernal age, Hugging no News like to a quick Ingage. These be Mars Sons, and must to Honour rise, While Others are for catching Butterflyes: Nor do I fear but I shall one day hear Their Fames as large as Guy's or Godfrey's were; And mount their spreading Wings from Gath to Dan, And cause the Turk renounce his Alcoran. Cease Critick then; of Heroes boast no more, We have as Royal Sparks as e're before. Upon the LATE PLOT. How is it Zimries, that you thus do Plot; And ne're content you with the Preys you've got? Look to your Ravenous Claws expos'd to pillage, On every Loyal State, Grange, Mansion, Village! Could not your Harpyes-fury be content With good Mens rapine, ruine, banishment, Nor all the Miseries that Sea or Land By th' Tyranny of your licentious hand Could lay upon us, satisfie your thirst, Nor move remorse for what you did at first; But Breath fresh veins, and make the festring wound Larger and deeper than your Agents found In their Perfidious Practise; when no doubt Their aime was to destroy both Branch and Root? Yet, what was done against you for all this? A fair Act of Oblivion Signed is For your Indemnity: and by it rest Safe, having richly feather'd your Nest With Spoile of Royallists, who, well-affected; Came short in Reaping th' Harvest they expected. “Some Honours they might get, but, all the while “Revenues wanted to support their Style: And, as th' Weakest ever goes to th' Wall, These had been fitter for an Hospital; And there remain Immur'd, secure, at ease, Than receive Honours when they want their Fees. Thrice-happy Knights of Windsor who have got Both States and Styles for which you ventur'd not Nor felt hard Duties, such as we have done, Yet most of us blink-ey'd are look upon. Maugre these storms, our thoughts be calm and still As if we were rewarded to our Will. So loyal and so faithfull try'd were we, Wee'd fight for th' King in spite of poverty. Our Resolution could not be compar'd With theirs, who fought to purchase a reward, And that unjustly gain'd: for your delights Were to make us poor naked Adamites. Prowess and Prudence chalked forth our way, Scorning those Craving Spirits fought for Pay, So long as they'd Revenues of their own, Or self-supportance to rely upon: They bearded danger, and for honour fought, Accompting Life a Tribute that they ought. This was right Gallantry; for it did bring, Midst all Extremes, some comfort to our King: For in his service having spent their Store, They spent their blood, what could a Sov'raign more? How much have you abus'd his Clemency, Who, having granted you Impunity For your mischievous pillage, must be forc't To have your new Conspiracies indor'st In Sanguine Characters, so deep imbru'd As they display your high ingratitude; And, make you Prodigies in after times, Blushing at you who blush'd not at your Crimes? How often have I in my Pastures known A Rogue Prance on a Horse that was mine own, And, in a brave insulting frontless sort, Yet, durst I not call him in question for't? How often have I seen my Fatlings kill'd? My Grounds and Medows by your Heifers till'd? How often have I by mine own Door gone, And seen my Pales and Houses trampled down: The Owner quite estranged from his Nest, As if he had therein no Interest? Rebells, what would you have?-I'd have you teacht, As to us Cavaliers Hugh Peters Preacht. Would you enjoy our Lands, our Stock, our Store, Or what's most deare to us: what would you more? Take it; nay, in your seazure you'r so speedy, As like Bould Men yee'ave taken it already. Let our Estates your Beggary advance, Onely reserve us our Allegeance Which you ne'r car'd for: our sole task was toyl, Restraint, hard duties, you receiv'd the Spoyl. And, after all this, when we were made bare And lean, as ever Pharaohs Cattel were; Such large Indulgence your brave Acts receive, You'r free'd from Stigma's, none dare call you Knave, Roundhead, or Crop-ear, but be entertain'd For Friends, when you have our Possessions gain'd. Yet, while we must not call you this nor that, We needs must hold you th' Assassins oth' State. But, this we utter not, for wee'r become To speak more with our thoughts than with our tongue. Now, would not such desertless tyes as these, Keep you from acting New Conspiracies? “By this, you knew to Justice what belong'd, “To leave your States to them whom you hadwrong'd. Howsoe're Heav'ns Judgments shown, your own hand delves, What Grace remitted, ruine to your selves. Those whom Heav'n means to shatter, those it mads, As may appear by these Rebellious Lads. Upon the FACE of REBELLION: By the Hand of a ROYALLIST, ARTFULLY DEBLAZON'D. Rebellion headed Faction in this sort, But prais'd be Heav'n, some Heads were set up for't; May Treason thrive so.-Seldom seen we have Sedition go gray-headed to the Grave. A Beast of Many Heads; we well may call That Monsterous, which grows Anarchical: Who kick at Princely Power, &amp; spurn a Crown, Yet could brook wel to wear one of their own. These were those Nimrod-Nemeses of wrath, Who beggar'd their Friends by Publick Faith; Grinding them to th' Bare Bones; much time misspent, To make their Parliament a Jackalent, Or a Shrove-Cock, a whirle-gig of State, For ev'ry Wag to throw his Cudgel at. These could not chuse, but they might clearly see, No Station manag'd without Soveraignty. Rivers owe their Allegeance to their Spring, And, these, who had their Influence from the King Became his Tyrants.—But, that Scean is done, “May ne're such Acts stain th'face of Albion. “And may our Scutchions still Distinction bear, “Betwixt a Rebell and a Cavaliere. A FAREVVELL-CAROL, To All COMMITTEE CARLES. Farewell Committee Men, if ye be Men, For, I'd be loath to dedicate my Pen To Savages; though I must tell you too, Th' uncivil Arabs would forbear to do, As you have done, to any Neighbours State, To pill him, and confine him to a Grate. But, of your goodness, I retein a Sense, By whom I've purchased such Patience, As I shall wish, that you may have the grace To have the like, when you are in like case: And, in like case you must, or else our State Must grow Anarchial and desperate. But, I must startle you, how e're it please, And cure you of your Lethargies disease. “It spoils the operation of a Pill, “For to apply it to the Patients will. Lend then your Eares, ye zealous Tribe of Gad, Since you have squeaz'd the substance that I had; I'm late-resolv'd, by th' benefit of art, To act with Dennis, the School-Masters Part. Of Rod and Custos I've provision made, For fit materials, to set up my Trade. And, with You first I purpose to proceed, For, some of you can neither write nor read; To ope the door of your intelligence, At least, to teach you how to conster sense. I will not School you in Rules of Division, Christs Cross was late enacted Superstition. My Discipline more novell points affords, As, first, for the due joyning of your words: Wherein, your Censures have so conscious been, As, those who heard you, knew not what they mean: Belching forth words of such stupendious wonder, Who heard you blest them from you, as from thunder. For Numbers too, though they be onely two, Yet, in your Summing, you displace them so; The Private ne're throve better, Publick worse; For, th' Publick creeps into the Private purse. For Gerunds, they'r Diurnals, and pretends All must be Supines that are CHARLES his friends. For Cases, they'r so strangely ordered here, The Vocative sounds onely Cavaliere. For Articles, their credit's so decay'd, That they are broke so soon as they are made. For Genders, I must tell you, yee'r such Men, I'de have you hold that Rule of Origen; Your Genitals meer Ablatives, Dear Brother, That none hereafter may beget another. For Pronouns, Nouns, Verbs, Adverbs, Participles, They'r all become Apocrypha's Disciples; The Loyal ranked amongst Adjectives, Who stand for Parliament Noun-Substantives. For your Declining, in this madding time, You teach the well-affected to decline; Other Declensions ye never seek, But hold them in your Conclave Heathen Greek. For Interjections, Blades of pure affections In their advance meet still with Interjections: So, as if two Suns shine within one Sphere, Then in one Realm Round-head and Cavaliere. For Persons, there is no respect, save those Who are the Senats friends, and Scepters foes: And by these you may guess how the World goes, For Scepter Friends are ever out at toes. For Præpositions, those are set before As Lucky Birds, who th' Capitol adore: For weekly Packets these Relations bring, That Præ rides for the State, Post for the King. For Concords, to produce them were a Ridle, The squeaking Bagpipe suits not with the Fidle: Yet there's some hope this harmony may take, Seeing Divisions our best Musick make. For Conjugations, after times may sing, “The Conjugal Estate has lost her Ring: With our late Presbyterian Translation, Changing our Font into a Peuter Bason. For your Conjunctions, never hope to see Any use of them while these Factions be: But, for Disjunctions, they are freely sown 'Twixt Sire and Son in every Countrey Town. I shall not trouble you with Moods and Tences, England has banish'd them with her five Sences. Time was, Time is; but so it comes to pass, The present Tence is not the same it was. These Principles, and Elements of art I shall inform you in with all my heart; But, being Scholars, you must be corrected, Which you would hardly brook oth' well-affected. For, it will scarcely be believ'd of any, You should be whipt, when you have lasht so many. But, if to learn, your Roundheads have no will, In Gods name be meer Ignoramus still. But, if these Rudiments to you seem dimmer, Let th' Parliament inform you by their Primer. From my Private School near New-Bridewell. THE SEQUESTERES SONNET. Come, come and tell me thou quaint thing, Late sequestred for the King, What needst thou care, since thou mayest share In freedom of the cheerfull'st ayr? Such liberty may give content to Subjects, When their Princes are injoyned to restraint. Thou hast a Cell, an impald Croft, Shady Arbour, downy toft, And, where is he, Sequesters thee, Or dare tax thy libertie? Loves liberty, which gives content to Subjects, While Princes stand debarr'd from fancy by restraint. Can I be poor, or feel annoy, When I am rich in earthly joy? Shall I pule, cry, moan, pine or dye, Or put finger in mine eye, Because State-sharks collect the rent of Subjects, Unto their loss, and Soveraigns discontent? Shall I, fond I, throb Lachrymæ, Or act part of Malevole With folded armes, surpriz'd with charms, Or bemoan my forfet Farms? An estrang'd Alien to content of Subjects, Who suffer in their Soveraigns late restraint? Yes, that I swear may drain a tear, Else all the World should not hear Me moan my self, though run on shelf, For a patch of worldly pelf: A little portion gives content to Subjects, Who wish no more of all their store, Than KINGS Infranchisement. No Mean, No Man. What is this Pomp, this Port, this flowr of glory, But a meer pageant, or a naked story, Presenting Man what his extraction is, And, what an unblest State is humane bliss? If rich, hee's proud; if poor, he envies them Who swell with more estate, or more esteem. If Fool, should he all Ophirs oar possess, The more he has, he does injoy the less. If wise, his own house cannot him contain, Some forein projects must surprize his brain; Where, while he feeds on hopes, and seekes to prey On others fall, his own falls to decay: For, how should he retein least hope, to come To wealth abroad, that cannot thrive at home? But, if Ambition wing our ayry flight, Look not how high we fly, but where we light. Who to his own State can his thoughts confine, He in his Croft enjoyes an Indian Mine.</field>
