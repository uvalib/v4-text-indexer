      <field name="fulltext">EFFUSIONS OF SOCIAL and RELATIVE AFFECTION. ELEGY On the death of a favourite Schoolfellow, Phillip Bonafous, who died of the small pox, in 1785. (From the Author's first Poems.) I GRIEVE to think how quick each blossom fades That decorates the thorny road of lifeâ How Sorrow's worm the tender bud invades, How oft 'tis blighted by Misfortune's strife. I grieve to think how Disappointment's breath Shrinks the young foliage of our budding hopes! How oft the sudden hand of cruel Death Each sweetest branch of young enjoyment lops. I had a friendâO, Lucio, ever dear! Still shall thy memory in my bosom live; Thy virtues bloom in recollection here, Dwell on my tongue, and in my theme survive. I had a friendâtho Heav'n had snatch'd away Each promis'd comfort of my tender age; In him it seem'd my losses to repayâ My sweet companion on life's toilsome stage! How fraught with tender feelings was his mind! O'erflowing font of sensibility! To friends how true! to relatives how kind! In generous zeal, how boundless and how free! But ah, Disease, with envious hand, assail'd The vital stem of each remaining joy: O'er his fair form the noxious pest prevail'd; Prompt to deform, and powerful to destroy. Who now shall sooth my sorrow-clouded mind? Who now the sad reflection shall relieve? Where shall my heart consoling friendship find? Misfortune's children still unpity'd grieve. The proud carnation, costly child of art, Droops not unheeded on the cultur'd plain. The florist's hand shall soon his aid impart, With care to rear it, and with props sustain. But if some hedge-row flower (of humbler worth) By Erus torn, the wounded head recline, The careless traveller treads it to the earthâ The herd, unpitying, to its fate resign. Not so didst thou, my heart's elected friend! You kindly courted when the world grew coy; When bland civility was at an end, And the cold kinsman turn'd the averted eye. For this shall Memory oft, with glistening tear, Thy form, thy friendship, and thy name renewâ Still Lucio dwell in recollection here, And all his virtues blossom in my view. Elegy, written during the Festival of Christmas, 1785. (From the same.) The time has been (but ah! farewell those daysâ Those cheerful days of innocence and mirth!) I bless'd the wained sun's convivial rays That gave this day of joyous pastime birth. Around the social hearth, at night, we throng'd, Where humour much, but more good-nature shin'd; While joke and song the cheerful feast prolong'd Beyond the usual hour for rest assign'd. Oft would our Sire the youthful train provoke; Full oft incite to pastimes gay and bland; Full oft himself revive the flagging joke, And, in the comrade, lose the sire's command. Good, gentle soul! who every soul could cheer!â Of morals blameless, as of manners gay; He scorn'd the stoick frown and tone severe, And rather chose by love than fear to sway. But he is gone; and gone the joys of lifeâ Now woes on woes roll thickening o'er my head; While Penury, and keen domestic Strife, And hopeless Love their mingled venom shed. Pale Melancholy's first-born daughter, Spleen, To my sick fancy paints a thousand ills: Upholds her shadowy, woe-depictur'd screen, Blasts every hope, and every prospect chills. Ah why, to all the real woes of life, Should sick Imagination add her store?â Ideal blending with substantial strife, To crush the feeble wretch oppress'd before? Ye cheerful Hours, unhurt by gnawing Care! Ye social Days of plenty, joy, and peace! Say will ye e'er the wrongs of Fate repair? Shall e'er the frowns of adverse Fortune cease? Elegy, written in 1786, at a time when the subject of Imprisonment for Debt was much discussed. Farewell thou last dim blush of fading dayâ Ye busy scenesâye bustling Cares, farewell: Lo Contemplation watch the parting ray, To lead the Votary to her pensive Cell! Yes, power serene! your awful haunts I love, What time, flow-pacing thro' the misty vale, Wrapp'd in Night's sober mantle, sad you rove, And breathe your precepts in the sullen gale, And I have heard you, in the breezy sigh Of Zephyrs moaning in the Moon's pale beam, While scarce their humid pinnions, as they fly, Shake the dark spray, or curl the spangled stream. And I have heard and felt the solemn call, What time, more awful, in the stormy blast, Amid the ruins of some ivy'd wall, You told of Earth's frail pomps, and follies past. O! lead me then, sad moralizing pow'r! To where thy Cavern fronts the raging main: There will I think on life's tempestuous hour, And human woe shall moralize the strain. Ah me! how long the gaunt disastrous train That croud with anguish Man's precarious day! How Sickness, Sorrow, Penury, and Pain, And Disappointment throng in dark array! How perjur'd Friendship darts the treacherous stingâ How all the youthful Passions, gay to view, Repentance, shame, and wild affliction bringâ While scorpion Furies all their paths pursue! Where Pleasure courts us with her smiling train, There Pain and Death prepare the hidden dartâ Where Wealth allures with hopes of promis'd gain, There Ruin waits to rend the wasted heart. How many from the golden dreams of life, Has my sad soul seen wak'd to iron woe! How many sunk in shame and hopeless strife, Who grasp'd at fame with hope's aspiring glow. From the high summit of well-founded hopes (If ought were founded in this fragile world) While each gay prospect round alluring opes, To Want's abyss what crouds are headlong hurl'd! To that abyss as, with imploring hands And bleeding hearts, precipitate they fall, Lo prosperous Avariceâfiend unfeeling! stands, And points the iron door, and grated wall. Is this the land where liberal feelings glow? Is this the land where Justice holds the scale? The felon's lot must pale Disaster know? And freemen give Misfortune's sons a gaol?â A gaol!âoh horror! what a sound is there To jar the feeling nerve of Virtue's ear! The dungeon's gloom must guiltless Sorrow share, Its noxious terrors, and its pangs severe? From scenes like these, let Contemplation soar, Nor sink desponding in the cheerless gloom; A better world, with better hopes, explore, Mount to the skies, and peer beyond the tomb. Sonnet to the Nightingale. 1788. Sweet Bird of Sympathy! whose voice alone Sooths the attentive ear of darkling Woe, Whose strains, responsive to the Wretch's moan, With softly melancholy influence flow, As thy sweet note thus melts upon my ear, I heave the sighâI shed the starting tear. For oh! of Lucioâdear, departed friend!â The fond memorial in that note I find. When Joy forbore her cheerful smile to lend, When Fortune lour'd on my benighted mind, Alone, with Friendship's sympathizing strain, He sooth'd my soul, and lull'd my bosom's pain. Sweet Bird of Sympathy! for this the tear Still shall Remembrance shed on Friendship's early bier! Lines presented by the Author, to his Mother, together with a crutch stick. (Re-printed from the Imperial Magazine.) Dear source of that life, which your kindness and care Not only preserv'd, but persists to endear, Who so oft o'er my infancy fondly would bend, Protection to yield, and assistance to lend; Ere yet my young limbs a firm fortitude knew, Or could hope for a prop, but from love, and from you, Whose solicitude prov'd (how incessantly tried!) The strength of my weakness, my help, and my guide; Since Providence will'd that, thro' infancy's cares, The follies of childhood, and youth's early snares, Your hand should conduct me to manhood's estate, When the full-flowing spirits can combat with Fate; And since that great Pow'r has now doom'd me to see Your age want the aid you imparted to me, O! let me (since mine it by nature appears) Be the stay of your steps, and the strength of your years. Meantime, at my hand, this small present accept; Both as emblem (or type) and a pledge of respect. What tho no quaint labour a polish impart, Nor the varnisher's daub, nor the cunning of art; Yet let not the roughness of Nature offend: It will ever be ready its service to lend. And the gift and the giver alike may you find, The stay of your steps, and the crutch of your mind. Stanzas On a clay candlestick, given to the Author by an esteemed and valuable friend. (See Memoir, p. xix.) (From the same.) The smallest gift from Friendship's partial hand To generous minds acquires extrinsic worth; As homeliest scenes our fond respects command, If, haply, honour'd by some valu'd birth. But thou, neat present of well-moulded clay! From still superior motives claim'st my love; In thee her humble emblem I survey, Whose worth you shadow, and whose friendship prove. The gift, where oft the visual radiance plays, The nightly studies of my Muse befriends; The giver, beaming wisdom's mental rays, My mind irradiates, and my judgment mends. With thee, what time the garish day is fled, And Noise and Folly quit the sombre scene, When Contemplation's deepest mantle spread, Bids passion sleep, and judgment reign sereneâ Oft shall my toil explore the classic ground Where never selfish Care, with heavy eye, Presum'd to pace his dull unfeeling round, Dead to the generous woe, or liberal joyâ The classic realms of Fancy, ever gay! Where smile the Graces, and where haunts the Muse; Or there where Truth directs the hallow'd way, Or heav'n-taught Science the dark maze pursues. Nor will I pass with light unheedful tread The realm, where midst the hoary wrecks of time, Eventful Histroy hails the mighty dead, And graves intent the instructive lore sublime. There too, with solemn Ethics by her side, I'll rove where Sentiment refines the heart; Nor shun, with frigid and fastidious pride, Where sportive Humour wings the glittering dart. Thus the lov'd scenes where Learning, Genius shine, Aided by thee, kind gift, will I explore; And oft the donor hail, in whom combine The mingled merits of their varied lore. O! thou, who blend'st in thy capacious thought, With these, what these could never teach alone, The useful lore from life's great drama caught, To sons of Science but too seldom known; Fain would digressive Friendship here display The liberal feelings of thy letter'd soul, Whose partial care directs my dubious way, Prompts the bright race, and aids me to the goal. To infant Genius who a fostering friend, Can watch the dawning of the faintest ray, With kindling zeal its influence extend, And chace the clouds of prejudice away. O! should that seeming dawn, you kindly hail, Prove no false glow-worm's short delusive gleamâ Thro' fortune's low'ring mists at length prevail, And dart the lustre of no feeble beam; In Poesy's horizon should it shine (Fond, flattering thought!) in full meridian glow, Then shall it boast the fostering care of Cline, And, Hawes's worth shall unborn Ages know. From mortal view by hard Misfortune hurl'd, Deep in oblivion's chaos hid I lay: He found, and plac'd me in the letter'd world, There bad my verse a moral light display. Yet still deep shadows o'er my genius hung, The clouds of error, and the mists of doubt; Misguided Taste her veil obscuring flung, Nor Critic-Friendship mark'd the dubious rout. From quick extinction then you kindly rose (A heav'n-sent gale) the infant beam to save; Chas'd, from my clouded course, these envious foes, And to my rays recruited vigour gave. Nor shall my mind, while night succeeds to day, The grateful memory of thy worth resignâ Or Muse forgetâwhile Muse can pour the lay, Her best, her earliest benefactorâCline. EXTEMPORE, On receiving a Rose from his Sister. (From the same.) Why, sever'd from its parent thorn, Assumes the rose a brighter hue Than when, impearl'd by dewy morn, Among surrounding sweets it grew? Why should it to the feasted sense, Within a narrow room confin'd, A richer perfume now dispense, Than when it breath'd the fresh'ning wind? Fraterna, hear the partial Muse The mystery's pleasing cause proclaim: More sweet its breath, more gay its hues, Since from Affection's hand it came. The Invitation. To Stella. July, 1789. (From the same.) Say, Stella, wilt thou rove with me, Far from the cheerful native scene, From smiling hill and valley flee, From harvest fields and pasture green? From these could'st thou contented range The city's bustling cares to prove? All, all these tranquil joys exchangeâ The sole return thy Damon's love? Yet hear me love, ere thou reply, A youth that scorns deception hear; No wealth is mine, the heart to buy; My cot is poor; my fate severe: Nor may'st thou look for pomp and shew, Or hope in Pleasure's train to move. Say, wilt thou, then, these joys forego?â The sole return thy Damon's love! Ah, think, what pain 'twill be to view The splendid city's gay parade, The festive dance, the public shew, The costly dress with pride display'dâ These, these to view; yet ne'er to shareâ Ah! would not this thy patience move? All, all these trials couldst thou bear?â The sole reward thy Damon's love. If so, my Stella, come with me, And quit the cheerful native scene; From smiling hill and valley flee, From harvest fields, and pasture green. And if thou heav'st a parting sigh, My bosom shall responsive move; Or shouldst thou weep, my tearful eye Shall well assure thy Damon's love. Yet, think my Stella, could'st thou bear To drudge those charms in ceaseless toil While other forms, less sweetly fair, In idle pomp around Thee smile. And when Mischance, or frowning Care My hasty ruffled temper moveâ Say, can'st thou from reproach forbear, And rest assur'd of Damon's love. If so, my Stella, come with me, Far from these rural scenes to stray: No youth more blest, more fond shall be, And none a truer heart display. For pride or gold let others wed, In scenes of noisy pomp to move; While we, by pure affection led, Will seek for nought but mutual love. STANZAS written in 1790. (From the same.) In rural metaphor full oft my song Hath sung the feverish pains of slighted love; With artful aim to charm the list'ning throng, More than the fair one's cruel heart to move. Though dying sighs might melt through ev'ry strain, Though tearful woe bedropt each murmur'd line, Those sighs aspir'd a poet's name to gain, Those tears impearl'd Ambition's darling shrine. 'Tis true, with Delia's sense and merit fir'd, Strong throbb'd my heart to gain the wondrous maid; Yet fond Ambition the proud wish inspir'd: And when the substance fled, I woo'd the shade. Nor less Melinda's philosophic mind, Her fame wide sounded wak'd the glow-worm fire; 'Till what Ambition urg'd, and verse refin'd, Reflection's beam bad silently expire. Thus, though full many a radiant fair I sung, My constant heart hath still remain'd the same; What name soe'er might falter on my tongue, Love was the theme, the wish'd-for guerdonâfame! But now, Ambition's vain pursuitâfarewell! Weary, at length I see the proud deceit; With plain Simplicity my heart shall dwell, Nor haughty dreams my social pleasure's cheat. And lo! Simplicity herself appears! In semblance fair, a blooming village maid; Her tender form my drooping fancy cheers, Her artless charms my throbbing heart invade. Soft on her youthful lip, a winning smile (Not such as town-bred Affectation wears) Speaks the mild temper, free from haughty guile, And the gay innocence of soul declares. Ye mincing daughters of fantastic Pride!â Ye glittering flies who pant in Folly's chace! Votaries of Fashion, lay your airs asideâ Come here, and learn the charms of real grace! See, with an ease which Fashion ne'er could teach, On steady foot she lightly glides along; While Health's pure glow, which Art may never reach, And untaught glances charm the gazing throng! Lo! native modesty her charms pervade, And with unconscious dignity adorn! This Pride would imitateâBut soon betray'd, The stiffen'd mimic only claims our scorn. O! sweet Simplicity! dear, rustic fair! Hence shall my song thy worth, o'er all, approve! Comeâlive with me; my pure affections share, With native Honour, and with artless Love. But ah! these soft desires, this fluttering heart, Prove the dear form no allegoric shade! Could fairy dreams such kindling hopes impart, So charm the senses, and the soul invade? And hark, how Admiration's raptur'd tale Steals in soft whispers through the rustic throng, 'Tis sheâmy Stella! pride of Catmose vale, Joy of each heartâand theme of every song! Yet come Arcadian nymph, as Dryad fair, Let the pure strain of artless passion move: Come live with me, my fix'd affections share With native Honour and with artless Love, EPISTLE to MERCUTIO. July, 1791. (From the Peripatetic.) While you, my friend, in London's giddy town, With jest and song each grave reflection drown, Flirt with gay belles, besiege fantastic wenches Who fire Love's glances from their band-box trenches, Whence, while their banners wave, they dauntless wield The various arms of Love's triumphant fieldâ The high-plum'd helm that each fierce bosom awes, And all the sacred panoply of gauze: While cares like these your youthful heart detain Far from the peaceful shade and rustic plain; Me here, remov'd from scenes of bustling noise, The town's lewd follies, and its sickly joys, The Muse perchance, perchance some stronger power Attracts to loiter in the rural bower. Yet, truth to say, on Catmose' cheerful plains No pensive gloom, no sombrous silence reigns; No solemn saws of philosophic pride, That bid the feelings of the heart subside! 'Tis transport all: the height of festive joy: And jocund hours on wings of rapture fly. Here (IÃ¶ Hymen!) Love triumphant dwells With Jest and Glee, and sound of merry bells: Mirth rules supreme o'er every friendly breast, And yields reluctant e'en the dues of rest. And yet, to hail fair Friendship's hallow'd pow'r, From joys like these I steal a silent hour, To thee, my lov'd Mercutio! to impart The new sensations of a social heart: âBut let us here to preface bid adieu, While I my journey's simple tale pursue. Releas'd, at length, from Duty's iron chain, Whose painful links the happier wish restrain, Full light of heart sets forth the man of rhime, For cheerful Catmose, Joy's triumphant climeâ Dear Land of Promise! for whose blissful groves (Haunts of the Virtues! Muses! Graces! Loves!) Long had I languish'd, thro' my drooping frame While fond Impatience lanch'd the youthful flame! And now, no more by angry Fate delay'd, Eager I fly to clasp the blooming maid. Tho Stamford's coach the Jewish sabbath kept, And man and beast in pious malice slept, My ardent soul disdain'd the feeble bar. Winds thwart in vain when Love's the pilot star! Up Highgate-hill, o'er Barnet's fatal heath, Where factious Warwick breath'd his latest breath; And hence to Hatfield, once of high renown For royal domes and heaths of barren brown, Thro' rain unwet, thro' dangerous roads serene, With limbs unwearied, and with cheerful mien, On foot I thrid. The turtle, from the glade, Trills the sad note that echoes thro' the shade, While glow-worms oft their amorous fires display, To light the wandering lover on his way: Like Hero's torch, that, thro' the midnight hour, Blaz'd, long-expecting, from the sea-beat tower, When bold Leander the impetuous tide Stemm'd with fond arm,âand in the conflict died. Ah, gentle worm! may no such fate assail Thy vagrant bridegroom, to the ruthless gale Who now, perhaps, his little wing displays, With eye fast anchor'd on thy silver rays. Swift to thy virgin bosom may the breeze Bear him secure, and all thy terrors ease. When now, at length, each cheerful hope was flown, And round, full oft, the anxious eye was thrown, Intent to seek (by angry Spleen opprest) Some neighbouring Inn, for hospitable restâ (Tho, these approach'dâimpatient of delayâ I still pursu'd my solitary way!) Advancing sounds my drooping spirits cheer, And the loud lash rings music in my ear. And lo! a coach, with steeds of fiery breed, Thro Stamford bound towards the banks of Tweed. No room within, I cheerly mount the roof, Against the rain, by love, not cloathing, proof: For, like a modern friend, so Fate decreed! My good surtout lurk'd in the hour of need Secure at home, together folded warm, And left me fenceless to the pelting storm. But short the storm: and now, with jocund lay And vacant laughter we deceive the way, While our stout guard, well soak'd with gin and ale, Roar'd at my âPaddy Bull,â and âSheering Tale;â Then smoak'd his pipe, laid down his threat'ning gun, And, while the steeds o'er darkling wild heaths run, Flat on his belly, o'er the coaches eaves, Snor'd out amainâto fright away the thieves. But see!âWhat comet, with disastrous glare, Thwarts the thick gloom, and frights the midnight air? What flame infernal, by demoniac breath Fann'd, on the confines of the lurid heathâ While haggard phantoms, with discordant yell, Throng round, malign, to brew the fatal spell? Such, to the fancy vers'd in Tales of Old, Might seem the spectres whom we now behold: But, truth to say, nor comet's hideous glare, Nor flame infernal frights the midnight air; Nor hags, nor demons, with discordant yell, Dance round the cauldron o'er the direful spell; But vagrant Gipsies, on the forest's bound, Squat round their fire loquacious on the ground. Poor harmless vagrants!âharmless when compar'd With those whom crouds adore, and courts rewardâ The price of fell ambition, and the meed Of each oppressive, every ruthless deed: Of cities sack'd, of empires overthrown, And struggling millions doom'd in chains to groan.â Poor harmless vagrants! whom the reeking knife, Red with the midnight wanderer's ravish'd life, Ne'er yet reproach'd; nor crimes of savage die, That the sweet flumbers of the night defy: Whose utmost want ne'er owns the stern appeal To threaten'd fury, or the brandish'd steel: Still rove secure; and may no beadle's thong Remorseless drive your wandering groups along! But still to ye may wood and heath supply The darling boon of savage Liberty!â Oft, harmless vagrants! as I lonely stray, May your rude groups adorn the woody way; And round your kettles, pendant o'er the fire, The ruddy smoak and cheerful flame aspire, While, loitering near, beneath the hawthorn shade, The tawny lover wooes the willing maid. Light wakes the Morn, in vail of fleecy clouds, Whose meek disguise her glowing beauties shrouds: The lark in air, the linnet on the spray, All seem to hail me, gratulous, and gay; The silver Ouze, as clear it winds along, Murmurs, responsive to the cheerful song, While its brisk tenants, as they sportive glide, Leap from the stream, and shew the glossy side. Thus pleas'd with all that Nature's stores display, Auspicious omens cheer me on the way; Till now, at length, in Stamford's ancient town, Whose gates and spires four neighbouring counties own, I light; nor idly linger to survey Her ancient piles, or Wiland's wandering way; But mount the steed, and fly before the gale, With eager hopes, to Catmose' fertile vale. But here the joys that wait what tongue can tell? What tender transports in my bosom swell! Nature's best boons my throbbing heart divideâ The tender mother, and the virgin bride. Oh! thou canst never guessâcanst ne'er conceive What rapturous charms in love-warm'd Beauty live, When the soft heart, unknown to practis'd guile, Speaks in the tear, and sparkles in the smile.â When the long-sever'd maid, whom passion warms, With joy commutual, rushes to your arms, Drops the fond head upon your throbbing breast, And yields to feelings not to be supprest. 'Tis not the thrilling touch of sensual joys (Which Nature's boon to lowest brutes supplies,) The couch of Loveâthe extatic fond embrace (Tho these from Virtue snatch a higher grace) That wake (whate'er the vulgar mind may deem) The richest transports of their pure esteem, Whose flames, that glow from intellectual fire, Give soul to Sense, and defecate Desire. No: their best joys from nobler sources springâ Joys saints might taste, and raptur'd seraphs sing: Soul join'd with soul, the sympathizing mind, Truth undefil'dâand feelings all refin'd; One spirit guidingâby one will inform'dâ And two fond bosoms by one essence warm'd. HARVEY. An APOSTROPHE. (The second and third Stanzas from the Peripatetic. 1792.) Blest was the hourâif bliss, indeed, belong To the high fervours of Poetic songâ Blest was the hourâif 'tis the bliss of youth To thirst for knowledge, and to pant for truthâ From Academic shades when Harvey came, Wak'd the first spark, and fann'd the etherial flame: When, midst BÃ¦otian fogs, his purer ray Pour'd on mine eye the intellectual day; And, sole instructor of my youthful mind, Rous'd the fine thrill extatic and refin'dâ Touch'd the keen nerve, and taught the tear to flow O'er Shenstone's moral page, and Jessey's artless woe. But, ah! more blest had been that fairer day (Why, why are proffer'd blessings spurn'd away?) When, gay of heart (the Tutor's talk no more) He proffer'd Friendship at my natal door:â More blest had beenâbut their ill-judging fears Who claim'd obedience from my tender years (With prudent saws from Traffic's school imbu'd) To check the cordial fires of youth intrude: Whence oft my Muse bewails, in pensive strain, That hearts for Friendship form'd, are form'd in vain. But, oh! that, Harvey! to thy classic ear Some friendly chance these artless lines might bear! That she, the Muse (each sordid care aloof) Who weaves, with feeling hand, the airy woof, From the wrought web a magic clue might lend, Once more to guide thee to thy sorrowing friend, Who loves thy merits, and in memory bears Thy mirth instructive, and thy friendly cares; And with this burthen saddens of the strain, That hearts for Friendship form'd, are form'd in vain. For ah! what pityâsince too truly known How thin the flowers of genuine bliss are strown, In this low vale of sorrows and of cares, How small the harvest, and how throng'd the tares; Along Life's road, how many a bramble grows, How many a nettle, for one fragrant rose,â What pity 'tis that Friendship's boon refin'd (Pleasure and food of every virtuous mind!) Should thus be cast with heedless scorn away, Smile unadmir'd, and unenjoy'd decay! Come, Harvey, come! nor let me more complain, That hearts for Friendship form'd, are form'd in vain. The above form a sort of series of the juvenile productions of the author; and as such merely they are presented. The volumes in which they appeared have fallen into meritted oblivion; from which few of the articles, it is hoped, will ever be revived. In the wide chasm that separates these from the ensuing poems, the following is introduced, from another pen. Invocation to Poetry. By Stella. 1793. O, Poesy! enlivening pow'r! Wilt thou accept my humble praise, (Sweet soother of the lonely hour!) Nor frown upon my artless lays? When care and sorrow fill the breast, 'Tis thou canst pour the healing balm; Or sooth the anxious soul to rest, When Wrongs annoy, or Fears alarm. 'Tis thine to chace the gloomy thought, The sullen frown, or glance severe: By thee the indignant eye is taught To shed the sympathising tear. May I thy soft, thy so thing pow'r, In each distressing moment, hail! Thou, who canst cheer the troubled hour, When Wisdom's feebler efforts fail. STANZAS To Rosa Bella Bianca, on her Birth-day. Norwich, August 8, 1796. Blossom of vernal sweetness, lovely Rose! Once more I tune the long-neglected lay, To hail the sun, whose favouring beams disclose Improving beauties with this genial day. Propitious Day! still as the circling year Renews its course, may'st thou, at each return, Vail'd in fresh show'rs of op'ning bliss appear, While Health's gay fires with purer ardour burn! And may the Loves and Graces still, as now, Play round the form and flush the artless cheek; While taste and virtue crown the polish'd brow, And thro' her eyes the native feelings speak! The while some youth, by Nature's partial love Form'd in the mould of Genius, Worth, and Sense, In early prime, her virgin heart shall move, And Hymen's torch its brightest ray dispense. So shall the charms on her fair form impress'd Enhance her bliss, and every tender sigh That heaves the softness of Bianca's breast, Be but the herald of approaching joy! Thus does, sweet Maid! the strain of Friendship flow, Gilding thy fate in colours of the morn: A spring-tide life, unchil'd by wintry woeâ Day without cloudâa rose without a thorn! But 'twill not be: some dregs of envious care In Life's incongruous cup the Fates will fling. Beauty and Worth the bitter draught must share, And Wisdom's self shall drink at Sorrow's spring. Be then each cloud that glooms life's fickle day, Like transient show'rs that cool the fervid skies; And from each vernal blossom's doom'd decay, May Virtue's store, and Wisdom's fruits arise. To Stella in the Country, Dec. 1796. Joy of my soul! who now, in Catmose' vale, Cradlest our drooping Infant on thy breast, And shield'st from Wintry blasts, that would assail His fading Cheek, ah! may no gale unblest Shake thy own tender frame, nor anxious care, For him thou leav'st, reluctant, mar thy rest. Midst thy long-sever'd Kindred may'st thou share The season's pastime's, and its joys encrease With fond remember'd tales of Infancyâ Its artless pranks, and freaks of wayward ire, When griefs were transient, when the halcyon, Peace, Spread her gay pinion, and high-bounding Glee Could every wish to kindling hope inspire. Nor wilt thou, as around the social fire Thy childhood's first companions throng to hear The tale, and much relate, and much enquireâ Nor wilt thou then forget (the pleasing tear Stealing from thy lov'd eye) to name the day When first thy artless form (remembrance dear!) Array'd in rustic innocence, and gay With all the modest graces that adorn The unadulterate mind, entranc'd my soul, And fir'd my raptur'd fancy, as I gaz'd. Ah! be thou ever blest! thrice-happy morn, Whose imag'd joys can present griefs controul! Bright tints of memory ne'er to be eras'd! Ye shall not fade with Fortune's transient day, But still life's thickening gloom cheer with reflective ray. âHereâ wilt thou say, âbeneath this rustic roof, âAlong those walks, and where yon woodbines twine âTheir winter-widow'd arms, in mournful proof âThat all that's sweet is transientâall that shine âIn vernal hope, must yield to the stern power âOf bleak Disaster, and each bloom resign âWak'd to short rapture in youth's feverish hour: âHere first we metâhere chang'd the mutual glance âThat with mysterious musings thrill'd the heart, âAnd wak'd the illusive glow of young desire: âPleasing, scarce felt, till Absence from his trance âAwak'd the slumbering Love, and barb'd his dart, âAnd fann'd, with many a sigh, the genial fire:â âHere first he told his passion, mingling oft âA melancholy tale, of stars unkind, âAnd threat'ning woes, and faithless friends, that scoft âAt undeserv'd misfortunes; there reclin'd, âHis plaintive verse, colour'd with darkest hues, âHis hopeless fortunes, and his wayward mind; âDeep'ning each shade, and with a moral muse, âWarning the partial heart he sought to gain.â Thus wilt thou say, and own, with modest pride, Thy artless looks that spoke the mutual flame, When thy young bosom, kindling at the strain, Confess'd the lover, monitor, and guideâ Most blest, if thy propitious smiles might claim The power to gild for him life's rugged road And guide his wounded step to Pleasure's calm abode. Yes, Stella, thus, amid the cordial throng, Wilt thou our days of early love renew: Days of delight! which memory would prolongâ To passion sacred, and to nature true. But other daysâanother scene succeeds, And private bliss is lost in public woes: O'er prostrate rights the patriot bosom bleeds, And Love's soft flame, for Ate's torch foregoes. Me, first arous'd by Afric's clanking chain, Then urg'd by Gallia's struggle, to enquire What woes, what wrongs Man's trampled race sustain, Stern Duty bids to strike the bolder lyre. Harsh sounds the note in Power's infatuate ear; Yet Man still groans; and claims a louder string: The heart's torn fibres feel the call severe!â The heart's best pleasures fly, with trembling wing. Ah! most unblest, whom thoughts like these inspire! His eyes no more shall tranquil slumbers close; His proudest joyâa feverish, transient fire! His fairest hopeâa catalogue of woes! Him lasting hatreds, short-liv'd friendships wait, Envy's foul breath, and Slander's forked tongue. Whom most he serves, shall darken most his fate, And whom he shelters, load with heaviest wrong. Imperious Duty! rigid, Spartan guide! Strew, strew, at times, a rose among thy thorns; Or steel each votive breast with stoic pride, 'Till from the gloom resurgent Virtue dawns. The Tartan Pladdie. Feb. 4, 1797. In Ossian's Hall, the bard of Yore Would charm the Highland lass and laddie, With tuneful harp, and songs in store Of feats perform'd in Tartan Pladdie. O! the graceful Tartan Pladdie, The pride of Highland lass and laddie, While verse can charm,/Or beauty warm, We'll ne'er forget the Tartan Pladdie. Then Love was free from sordid guile, And Freedom warm'd each gallant laddie, And worth alone could win the smile Of bonny lass in Tartan Pladdie. O! the graceful Tartan Pladdie, That deck'd, of Yore, the lass and laddie! So braveâso rare!â/So kindâso fair! Was youth and lass in Tartan Pladdie. But not on days like these I call, Nor sing of Highland lass or laddie; High-bosom'd maid in Ossian's Hall, Or antique chief in Tartan Pladdie. But O! the modern Tartan Pladdie, For Sara wove by skilful laddie! My verse essays/To sing the praise Of Sara, in her Tartan Pladdie.â Soft is her air: no sweeter smile E'er won the heart of faithful laddie, Nor bosom more estrang'd to guile Was ever deck'd with Tartan Pladdie. O! the modern Tartan Pladdie! That wins the heart of every laddie: The proudest fair/In Fashion's glare, Might envy Sara in her Pladdie. But should I sing her charms of mind, My verse would fire each list'ning Laddie, Her temper gentle, free, and kind, And gayer than her Tartan Pladdie. O! the lass in Tartan Pladdie! How blest shall be that favour'd laddie, The guileless youth/Whose fervent Truth Shall win the lass in Tartan Pladdie. Thus do the Loves and Graces blend In her, who wears the Tartan Pladdie, In every nymph she finds a friend, A lover in each youthful laddie. O the graceful Tartan Pladdie! That wins, alike, the lass and laddie! Long may the fair/Each blessing share, And charm us with her Tartan Pladdie! For me, whose wedded love is plight To her, far off, who loves her laddie, In Stella's charms I still delight, Tho never deck'd in Tartan Pladdie! YetâO! the lass in Tartan Pladdie! My verse shall tell to every laddie, In friendly lays,/The peerless praise Of Sara in her Tartan Pladdie. Yes, Stella! thine's the sigh of loveâ And well thou know'st thy faithful laddie; But friendship's flame thou'lt still approve For Sara in her Tartan Pladdie. O! the lass in Tartan Pladdie! Soon may she bless some worthy laddie, While I still prove/A brother's love For Sara in her Tartan Pladdie. To Stella. Feb. 8, 1797. When kind Hope, at seasons smiling, Tells of changing fortune nighâ When gay Fancy, sweetly guiling, Whispers of approaching joy, Then my thoughts, by Love directed, To my Stella's bosom flee; And the flattering boon expected, Hopes its worth from pleasing thee. Or when Fortune, sadly glooming, Threats with storms of hovering woes, Fancy still, thy form assuming, Grief's increasing pang bestows. Every rude assault of anguish This undaunted breast can bear; But shall Stella droop and languish?â Every shaft can wound me there! Lines, written at Bridgewater, in Somersetshire, on the 27th of July, 1797; during a long excursion, in quest of a peaceful retreat. Day of my double birth! who gave me first To breathe Life's troubled air; and, kindlier far Gave all that makes Life welcomeâgave me her Who now, far distant, sheds, perchance, the tear In pensive solitude, and chides the hours That keep her truant wanderer from her armsâ Her's and our smiling babes:âEventful Day! How shall I greet thee now, at thy return, So often mark'd with sadness? Art thou, say, Once more arriv'd a harbinger of woes, Precursor of a Year of miseries, Of storms and persecutions, of the pangs Of disappointed hope, and keen regrets, Wrung from the bosom by a sordid World That kindness pays with hatred, and returns Evil for good?âa World most scorpion-like, That stings what warms it, and the ardent glow Of blest Benevolence too oft transmutes To sullen gloom and sour misanthropy, Wounding, with venom'd tooth, the fostering breast That her milk turns to gall. Or art thou come, In most unwonted guise, O, fateful Day! With cheering prophecy of kindlier times?â Of hours of sweet retirement, tranquil joys Of friendship, and of loveâof studious ease, Of philosophic thoughtâpoetic dreams In dell romantic, or by bubbling brook, High wood, or rocky shore; where Fancy's train, Solemn or gay, shall in the sunbeam sport, Or murmur in the gloom, peopling earth, air, Ocean, and woodland haunt,âmountain, and cave, With wildest phantazies:âwild, but not vain, For, but for dreams like these, Meonides Had never shook the soul with epic song, Nor Milton, slumbering underneath the shade Of fancy-haunted oak, heard the loud strain Of heavenly minstrelsey:ânor yet had he, Shakespear (in praise of whom smooth Avon still Flows eloquent to every Briton's ear,) Pierc'd the dark womb of Nature, with keen glance, Tracing the embrio Passions ere their birth, And every mystic movement of the soul Baring to public ken.âO, Bards! to whom Youth owes its emulation, Age the bliss Of many a wintry evening, dull and sad, But for your cheering aid!âYe from whose strains, As from a font of Inspiration, oft The quickning mind, else stagnant, learns to flow In tides of generous ardour, scattering wide Smiling fertility, fresh fruits and flowers Of intellectual worth!âO! might my soul Henceforth with yours hold converse, in the scenes Where Nature cherishes Poetic-Thought, Best cradled in the solitary haunts Where bustling Cares intrude not, nor the throng Of cities, or of courts. Yet not for aye In hermit-like seclusion would I dwell (My soul estranging from my brother Man) Forgetful and forgotten: rather oft, With some few minds congenial, let me stray Along the Muses' haunts, where converse, meet For intellectual beings, may arouse The soul's sublimer energies, or wing The fleeting Time most cheerilyâThe Time Which, tho swift-fleeting, scatters, as he flies, Seeds of delight, that, like the furrow'd grain, Strew'd by the farmer, as he onward stalks Over his well-plough'd acres, shall produce, In happy season, its abundant fruits. Day of my double Birth! if such the Year Thou usherest in, most welcome!âfor my soul Is sick of public turmoilâah, most sick Of the vain effort to redeem a Race Enslav'd, because degenerate; lost to Hope, Because to Virtue lostâwrapp'd up in Self, In sordid avarice, luxurious pomp, And profligate intemperanceâa Race Fierce without courage; abject, and yet proud; And most licentious, tho' most far from free. Ah! let me then, far from the strifeful scenes Of public life (where Reason's warning voice Is heard no longer, and the trump of Truth Who blows but wakes The Ruffian Crew of Power To deeds of maddest anarchy and blood) Ah! let me, far in some sequester'd dell, Build my low cot; most happy might it prove, My Samuel! near to thine, that I might oft Share thy sweet converse, best-belov'd of friends!â Long-lov'd ere known: for kindred sympathies Link'd, tho far distant, our congenial souls. Ah! 'twould be sweet, beneath the neighb'ring thatch, In philosophic amity to dwell, Inditing moral verse, or tale, or theme, Gay or instructive; and it would be sweet, With kindly interchange of mutual aid, To delve our little garden plots, the while Sweet converse flow'd, suspending oft the arm And half-driven spade, while, eager, one propounds, And listens one, weighing each pregnant word, And pondering fit reply, that may untwist The knotty pointâperchance, of import highâ Of Moral Truth, of Causes Infinite, Creating Power! or Uncreated Worlds Eternal and uncaus'd! or whatsoe'er, Of Metaphysic, or of Ethic lore, The mind, with curious subtilty, pursuesâ Agreeing, or dissentingâsweet alike, When wisdom, and not victory, the end. And 'twould be sweet, my Samuel, ah! most sweet To see our little infants stretch their limbs In gambols unrestrain'd, and early learn Practical love, and, Wisdom's noblest lore, Fraternal kindliness; while rosiest health, Bloom'd on their sun-burnt cheeks. And 'twould be sweet, When what to toil was due, to study what, And literary effort, had been paid, Alternate, in each other's bower to fit, In summer's genial season; or, when, bleak, The wintry blast had stripp'd the leafy shade, Around the blazing hearth, social and gay, To share our frugal viands, and the bowl Sparkling with home-brew'd beverage:âby our sides Thy Sara, and my Susan, and, perchance, Allfoxden's musing tenant, and the maid Of ardent eye, who, with fraternal love, Sweetens his solitude. With these should join Arcadian Pool, swain of a happier age, When Wisdom and Refinement lov'd to dwell With Rustic Plainness, and the pastoral vale Was vocal to the melodies of verseâ Echoing sweet minstrelsey. With such, my friend!â With such how pleasant to unbend awhile, Winging the idle hour with song, or tale, Pun, or quaint joke, or converse, such as fits Minds gay, but innocent: and we would laughâ (Unless, perchance, pity's more kindly tear Check the obstreperous mirth) at such who waste Life's precious hours in the delusive chace Of wealth and worldly gewgaws, and contend For honours emptier than the hollow voice That rings in Echo's cave; and which, like that, Exists but in the babbling of a world Creating its own wonder. Wiselier we, To intellectual joys will thus devote Our fleeting years; mingling Arcadian sports With healthful industry. O, it would be A Golden Age reviv'd!âNor would we lack Woodnymph, or NaÃ¯d, to complete the group Of classic fable; for, in happy time, Sylvanus, Chester, in each hand should bring The sister nymphs, Julia of radiant eye And stately tread, the Dryad of the groves; And she, of softer mien, the meek-ey'd maid, Pensively sweet! whom Fancy well might deem The Fairy of the brooks that bubble round. Ah! fateful Day! what marvel if my soul Receive thy visits awfully? and fain With Fancy's glowing characters would trace Thy yet to me blank legend?âpainting most What most my bosom yearns forâFriendship's joys, And social happiness, and tranquil hours Of studious indolence; or, sweeter far! The high poetic rapture, that becalms Even while it agitates?âAh, fateful Day! If that the Year thou lead'st (as fain my soul Would augur, from some hours of joy late past, And friendship's unexpected)âif the Year Thou usherest in, has aught, perchance, in store To realize this vision, welcome mostâ Ah most, most welcome! for my soul, at peace, Shall to it's native pleasures then return, And in my Susan's arms, each pang forgot, Nightly will I reposeâyielding my soul (Unshar'd, unharrass'd, by a thankless world) To the domestic virtues, calm, and sweet, Of husband and of fatherâto the joys Of relative affiance;âits mild cares And stingless extasies; while gentlest Sleep, Unwoo'd, uncall'd, on the soft pillow waits Of envyless Obscurity.âAh, come! Hours of long-wish'd tranquility! ah come: Snatch from my couch the thorn of anxious thought, That I may taste the joys my soul best loves, And find, once more, âthat Being is a Bliss!â The Farewell. Written at the request of an intelligent and beautiful young lady, with whom the Author happened to meet, at Uley, in Glocestershire. Aug. 10, 1797. A wanderer from my distant home, In quest of Wisdom's various lore, Awhile, with devious steps, I roam, And Pleasure's softer scenes explore. In Uley's sweet sequester'd shades I seek the fleeting form of Joy, Where Strife, nor busy Pomp pervades, Nor envious Cares the soul annoy. âTo Lloyd's delightful bower repair! âPerchance the Nymph may there reside.â Thanks whispering Sylph.âI found her there, In Youth's soft bloom, and Beauty's pride. A wreath of flowers, of roseate glow, The tresses of her brow confin'd; While, loosely, o'er her robe of snow, The playful ringlets flow'd behind. In modest guise, that robe behold Enshrine from view each softer grace. Yet may the eye, thro every fold, The magic curves of beauty trace. What more could partial Heaven dispense To such a shape and such an air? âThe charms of temperâgeniusâsense!ââ Sense, genius, temperâall are there. Pleas'd with the Visionârarely seen, I gaz'd the happy hours away; Till Twilight, from her thickening skreen, Reproachful chid the fond delay. The Bird of Night (too sadly wise!) Thus seem'd, in harshest notes, to singâ âRemember Man, that Pleasure flies: âShe rides on Time's impetuous wing: âOr if, awhile, her destin'd flight âThe partial vision would delay, âStern Duty, with relentless might, âThe hapless votary tears away.ââ Ah! Bird of Night (too sadly wise!) I own thy envious warning true; For Duty calls, and Pleasure flies:â O! blooming form of Joy, adieu! âYet pause,â she said, âor e'er thou part, âInvoke the Muse, and tune the lay; âIf Uley's shades have sooth'd the heart, âWith grateful verse the boon repay.â Ah! hard request. A bliss so pure, What hasty verse can fitly tell? What can itâbut the nymph assure, âRemembrance shall on Uley dwel?â Yes, tho thro' adverse regions bound, Tho Pleasures court, or Cares annoy, I'll still remember where I found The blooming form of fleeting Joy: And, in her distant home reclin'd, I'll sometimes hope the gentle maid, With pleas'd regret, will call to mind, The wandering Bard in Uley's shade. The Reply. âFortune waft you on your way!â Sighs the Nymph, in sweet adieuâ âFortune waft you on your way, âPleasure lead, and smiles pursue. âTo the partner of your heart, âSpeed ye on the wings of Joy: âBlest the partner of your heart! âSorrow ne'er your peace annoy. âFortune waft you on your way!â âTill the gentle fair you see. âLove shall crown youâfar away: âYet, may Friendship think on me. âThy summer bower, thy wintry fire âMay the social pleasures throng:â âSummer's bower, and winter's fire âCheer'd alike with tuneful song. âFortune waft you on your way!â Sighs the nymphâbut sighs in vain. Fortune turns another way: Verse and Beauty plead in vain. On leaving the Bottoms of Glocestershire; where the Author had been entertained by several families with great hospitality. Aug. 12, 1797. Regions of hospitality! dear scenes Where I have loiter'd cheerily, and quaft The nectar'd bowl of Friendship, or have rov'd The live-long summer's day, in pensive thought, Or kindlier converseâAh! delightful vales! O'er which the hand of partial Nature sheds Each wilder grace, while Culture and the Arts Of civiliz'd improvement spread around Their gay varieties, enlivening all With social decorationâfare ye wellâ For I must leave ye, pleasant haunts! brakes, bourns, And populous hill, and dale, and pendant woods; And you, meandering streams, and you, ye cots And hamlets, that, with many a whiten'd front, Sprinkle the woody steep; or lowlier stoop, Thronging, gregarious, round the rustic spire, Warm in the quiet glen. Ah! with what joy (Scenes that I leave reluctant!) with what joy Have I beheld ye, at the varying hour, Dawn, or the noon of night, or mid the glare Of PhÅbus' sultry season, when your groves Woo'd to sequester'd musings. Thence, how sweet (From your romantic scenes, and sylvan hauntsâ Tho sylvan, yet not solitary) to hear The distant hum, that, as from nectar'd hives Stor'd with the fragrance of your thymie banks, Came whispering on the breeze: for not to gloom Lethargic, or the hermit's inward prayer Of visionary silence, are your haunts (As erst, perchance, in Superstition's day) Consign'd, and pious inutilityâ Once holy deem'd. Here holier Industry, Even from the dawning to the western ray, And oft by midnight taper, patient, plies Her task assiduous; and the day with songs, The night with many an earth-star, far descried By the lone traveller, cheers amidst her toil. Nor cheerless she; nor to her numerous raceâ If semblance may be trustedâ(as too oft) Like a penurious step-dame, scantily 'The appointed task rewarding. By her side Sits lowly Comfort, in her decent stole (If homely, yet commodious,) dealing round The well-earn'd bread of sustenance; while shout The circling infants; their sleek ruddy cheeks, Like the sunn'd side of brown Pomona's fruit, Gladdening the kindred eye. Ah! 'tis a scene That wakes to social rapture. Nor, as yet, Towers from each peaceful dell the unwieldy pride Of Factory over-grown; where Opulence, Dispeopling the neat cottage, crowds his walls (Made pestilent by congregated lungs, And lewd association) with a race Of infant slaves, brok'n timely to the yoke Of unremitting Drudgeryâno more By relative endearment, or the voice Of matronly instruction, interspers'dâ Cheering, or sage; nor by the sports relax'd (To such how needful!) of their unknit prime Once deem'd the lawful charter. Little here Intrude such pompous mansionsâbetter miss'd. Therefore I love thee, Chalford, and ye vales Of Stroud, irriguous: but still more I love For hospitable pleasures here enjoy'd, And cordial intercourse. Yet must I leave Your social hauntsâfor not my unblest feet Yet may I rest, or my long wanderings close, Tho weary'd: but thro' many an untried scene (Perhaps from this how differing!) shape my way, Beneath my weight of sorrows; where to find Some nook obscure, that I may lay them down, And lap me in Oblivion. Once again, Then, once again, and my full heart no more Lingering shall falterâonce again, farewellâ Dear scenes of hospitality and joy!â A long farewell:âfor I, perchance, no more, Lonely, or mingling with the cordial group That made your haunts thrice lovely, hence shall trace Your wild varieties. Yet in my heart Shall live your scenes endear'd; and when, at eve, With her, my soul's lov'd partner, by the light Of blazing fuel, o'er the wint'ry hearth, Of joys past by, and the remember'd smiles Of friendship, still more cheering, I renew The treasur'd images, ah! then the names Of Norton and of Newcombâon my tongue, And hospitable Partridge, not unmark'd With lengthen'd emphasis, shall frequent dwell: And theirs, the cordial youths, who to each scene Of curious observation led my steps Inquisitive; and, with their social mirth, Deceiv'd the way. And, as these scenes renew'd, Cheer our lone cottage, the sooth'd heart shall smile, Conciliated, that, some there areâsome few, Still warm and generous, by the changeling world Not yet debauch'd, nor to the yoke of fear Bending the abject neck: but who, erect In conscious principle, still dare to love The Man proscrib'd for loving human kind. The Woodbine. Dovedale, Oct. 1797. Sweet flower! that loiterest on the autumnal branch Beyond thy wonted season, pleas'd to view, In Dove's pure mirror, thy reflected charms, And cheer her with thy fragrance, be thou blest!â For thou hast sooth'd my heart; and thy soft scent (Mild as the balmy breath of early love!) Hath warm'd my kindling fancy with the thoughts Of joys long pastâof vernal days, how sweet! Past with my gentle Stella, far awayâ Even in the vale of Catmose. Or my heart, Turning from retrospects to dreams of hopeâ Paternal hope! can dwell on thee, sweet flower! (Emblem of artless softness) till I see, In Fancy's glass, the offspring of my love Seeking the fragrant bower, to breathe, or hear, (In Youth's due season) the delightful tale Of foul-awakening passion. Gentle flower! The thought, perchance, is wildâthe hope is vainâ (For, ah! what blighting mildews wait the hours Of life's frail spring-tide!) yet 'tis cheering sweetâ And my heart hails it, gentle flower!âwell pleas'd If o'er the sterrile scene of real life Imagination sometimes shed around Her transient blooms:âfor blissful thoughts are bliss. To the Infant Hampden.âWritten during a sleepless night. Derby. Oct. 1797. Sweet Babe! that, on thy mother's guardian breast, Slumberest, unheedful of the autumnal blast That rocks our lowly dwelling, nor dost dream Of woes, or cares, or persecuting rage, Or rending passions, or the pangs that wait On ill-requited services, sleep on; Sleep, and be happy!â'Tis the sole relief This anxious mind can hope, from the dire pangs Of deep corroding wrong, that thou, my babe! And the sweet twainâthe firstlings of my love! As yet are blest; and that my heart's best pride, Who, with maternal fondness, pillows thee Beside thy Life's warm fountain, is not quite Hopeless, or joyless; but, with matron cares, And calm domestic Virtues, can avert The melancholy fiend, and in your smiles Read nameless consolations. Ah! sleep onâ As yet unconscious of The Patriot's name, Or of a patriot's sorrowsâof the cares For which thy name-sire bled; and, more unblest, Thy natural father, in his native land, Wanders an exile; and, of all that land, Can find no spot his home. Ill-omen'd babe! Conceiv'd in tempests, and in tempests born! What destiny awaits thee?âReekless thou. Oh! blest inapprehension!âLet it last. Sleep on, my Babe! now while the rocking wind Pipes, mournful, lengthning my nocturnal plaint With troubled symphony!âAh! sleep secure: And may thy dream of Life be ne'er disturb'd With visions such as mar thy father's peaceâ Visions (Ah! that they were but such indeed!) That shew this world a wilderness of wrongsâ A waste of troubled waters: whelming floods Of tyrannous injustice, canopy'd With clouds dark louring; whence the pelting storms Of cold unkindness the rough torrents swell, On every side resistless. There my Arkâ The scanty remnant of my delug'd joys! Floats anchorless; while thro' the dreary round, Fluttering on anxious pinion, the tired foot Of persecuted Virtue cannot find One spray on which to rest; or scarce one leaf To cheer with promise of subsiding woe. MARIA. A FRAGMENT. The following thought originated in one of those infantile endearments, to which the parental heart cannot âperhaps, ought not to be insensible. It occurred, and was hastily committed to paper, during the bustle and preparation for the author's removal, with his family, from Derby to Llys-Wen. It is, perhaps, somewhat more tinctured with political sentiment, than is entirely consistent with the general tenour and object of this Publication: but an interest of another sort forbad its suppression. It forms a natural prologue to the Tragedy that follows; and, on that account, the sensibility of the reader, whatever his opinions may happen to be, will readily excuse the insertion. Dear is the Babeâthrice dear, to my fond heart! For she was my first born; and she has sooth'd, With many an infant smile, the anxious hours Of hard captivity; what time, impell'd By tyrannous suspicion, and the thirst Of uncontroul'd dominion, impious men Immur'd thy patriot sons, Oh, hapless Isle! Once deem'd the land of Freedom, now the den Of infamous Corruption. Then how oft Yearn'd my fond heart, and for the social bliss, Permitted at short intervals, and rareâ Rare, and imperfect; by the watchful eyes, And ears, and prying insolence of guards Check'd and imbitter'd, have I heav'd the sigh, And felt the anxious wish, that yet the tongue Disdained to utter, or the throbbing breast To own, uncheck'd:âalive to every pang That Nature dictates; but, not less, alive To the strong sense of duty; to the voice Of patriots and of martyrs, oft array'd, At dawn or even-tide, around my couch, With presence all inspiring, and with tongues Awfully eloquent, that bad me think â'Twas for Mankind I suffer'dâfor the cause âFor which a Hampden fought, a Sidney bled; âFor which the Gracchi perish'd, and for which âEach high exploit that, with unweary'd breath, âFame, even from eldest time, still trumpets forth âWas erst achiev'd.ââAh! visions, that could rouse Enthusiastic ardours! ye were oft My props, my consolations: ye could turn My bonds to trophies, my keen wrongs to boons, My solitude to high communion;â Could make me laugh to scorn the threats of Powerâ His mock tribunals, solemn pageantries, And axe, already whetted in the pause Of bloody expectation. Ah! how oft, Warm'd by such thoughts, has the gaunt scaffold seem'd A car of glorious triumph, banner'd round With wreaths and well-earn'd trophies. Death no more Was hideous; and the Tyrant lost his power. But there were times when fonder thoughts prevail'd, Soft'ning, but not abasing, the stern brow Of Patriot-Emulation:âchiefly then When, with a tardy pace, the wish'd for hour Approach'd, that to a husband's, father's sight Promis'd the social banquet. Thenâah! then, When thro' my grated dungeon I have gaz'd, With straining eye unmov'd, upon the gate Thro' which the partner of my soul should passâ And this, my only babe:âmy only, then, And still my best beloved!âah! how high (With what a tide of fervour thro' my breast) Swell'd the fond passionâfor Thee, babe belov'd!â (Even in the earliest dawn of infancy, So sweet thy promise!) and, for Her, more dear To my connubial heart, that she had giv'n Birth to thy infant sweetness.â Oct. 1797. PATERNAL TEARS. EFFUSION I. Llys-Wen, Feb. 1800. To J? G?. AH! generous friend! who, with a patriot's zeal, Stood'st forth, undaunted, in oppression's hour, To shield this head devoted; and who still, With unrepenting kindness (most unlike The changeling multitude) essay'st to prop The reed thou sav'd'st unbrokenâvain the hope!â Tho now no more, with her insensate howl, The demon Persecution, tir'd, intrudes On my sequester'd privacyâtho late The autumnal deluge, by thy care disarm'd, Fell on my fields innoxious, and the rage Of hostile elements, by thee oppos'd With sympathising friendship, but secur'd A less penurious harvest:âvain the care That from remorseless Destiny would snatch Her hopeless victim. Me, from ill to ill, From woe to woe still urging, her fierce hate Pursues incessant, and has pierc'd, at last, With barbed shaft, that never shall be drawn The seat of vital feeling. Yes, 'tis here: Deep in my heart I feel it: the poor heart, That with convulsive wildness throbs, awhile, But soon shall throb no more. So deems, at least, Hope, that has now no refuge but despairâ In soothing strain so whispers: So the chords Of this frail being (sensitive too much To every touch of passion) sad, reply With dissonance responsive. Yes they jar: Each nerve and fibre feels the untuning touch Of most assur'd decay. Dim swims the sight; The vital spirits languish; and the blood, No more obedient to the order'd course Of self-preserving Nature, refluent oft Turns on her o'ercharg'd fountain; or, impell'd By wildering Anguish, rushes to the brain, And whelms the sense in apoplectic whirl, That Nature's chain seems bursting.âWhy but seems? Why is the stroke retarded?âAh! my friend! That these prophetic calls to me alone Might give concernmentâthat this head repos'd Upon Oblivion's turf, no widow'd heart Might heave in wilder agonies; nor they, The orphan'd pledges of our hapless loves, Whom Fate as yet has spar'd, defenceless mourn Their unprovided state, and infant years Cast on a hostile world! How welcome then The voice that summon'd to the insensate tomb How pleas'd obey'd!âhow aided! For to himâ Ah! what to him avails the sentient power To whom all sense is pain? Who reft of joyâ Reft of each solaceâreft of all that fed Hope's vital lamp, benighted, droops, appall'd, Amid the horrors of sepulchral gloomâ A conscious maniac?âwhile thought on thought Flows on in sad monotonyâand all That in the frame of Nature wont to joy Sight, or the touch, or hearing, seems to blend In funeral lamentation, and recal, With dirgeful record, the afflictive hour Irremeable? And such, my friend, am I. For she, alas! is gone, in whom I liv'dâ In whom all hope was center'dâwhose sweet smiles And fair expanding beauties, thro' the night Of my disastrous destiny diffus'd A soothing radiance; with reflective beam Tempering its sombrous horrors.âOh! most like That boreal dawn that oft, in arctic climes, With gay illusive splendour, gilds the gloom Of the long winter; and false hope awakes Of genial suns, and op'ning flow'rs, and sweets Of vernal joyance, from the genial south Approaching.âYet to them, the Day shall comeâ Tho distant. O'er their hills of melting snows, And sudden-blooming plains, the northering tribes Shall see their Summer God, in gorgeous pomp, Rush joy-dispensing. But for me no more Shall dawn the vital Day Star. Spring no moreâ Nor joyous summer, in my blighted heart, Shall glow with genial warmth. 'Tis winter all. Darkness, and Storm, and ever-during Frost Involve my hopes; and, in Maria's grave My sun is set for ever: sunkâextinct, In cold, eternal night. Nor ye who judge A parent's anguish by the vulgar ties That bound parental passion, vainly deem My Grief's excess unmanly: nor insult, With vain Philosophy, the poignant woes That rend the sentient texture of this breast: For 'tis no vulgar loss I'm doom'd to mourn, And with no vulgar feeling;ânor such tears As other fathers shed o'er other graves. Shall dew Maria's turf, or ease this heart, Whelm'd with exhaustless sorrow. Who would judge My bosom's anguish, must have known the worth That wak'd that bosom's fondness; must have known My fostering cares; like me, with raptur'd eye, Have mark'd each op'ning grace; have seen each germe Of fond tuition, in that grateful soil, Expand with matchless promise; must have felt Association's power, that round the heart (Blending events and feelingsâtimes and things) Twines links of adamant. Thisâthis, and moreâ They must have known the father, known the childâ Felt her endearments, and have shar'd my fate. And much of this hast thou, O, friend belov'd! And she, thy bosom's partner; and the train Fraternal, who, perchance, with tearful eye And bosoms sadly throbbing, round shall throng Thy wintry fire, what time, with faltering voice Thou read'st this sad memorial. Yes, ye knew At once the lost and loser. Hence to you, Seeking the balm of sympathy, I ope My bosom's inmost anguish: in your ear Pour all my griefs;âand, fearless of reproof, Proclaim my weakness:âif that name belong To love so meritted, to tears that flow From such remember'd sweetness.âO, my babe! Maria! Oh, Maria! thy lov'd name, While Nature yet is vocalâwhile this heart To this sad tongue can dictate, thy lov'd name The rocks and conscious echoes shall repeat, And murmuring Vaga mourn no loss but thine. EFFUSION II. In the Vale of Taff. May 13, 1800. Maria! Oh, Maria! my sweet babe!â But ah! she hears not. Vainly that lov'd name These lips reverberateâvainly these fond eyes Roll round, in asking gaze, and, missing thee, Find nought but vacancy. The budding Spring That, in profuse luxuriancy, adorns Mountain and valeâthe ever-murmuring brook, And choir of Nature's songsters charm no more, Nor soothe my bosom's sadness. Thou art gone, Who wert my spring of comfortâOn thy cheek Bloom'd fairer hopes than ever vernal gale Wak'd in the May-tide morningâPurer thouâ More sweetly playful, in thy sportive wiles, Than Cambria's dimpling rills. Thy infant voice Than birds was more melodious, when they tune Their softest love notes. Ah, in Nature's store Is there aught beauteousâaught that Sense can prize, Or Fancy hope to feed on, but must hence Renew my keen affliction?âThou art gone!â And I in vernal scenes, henceforth, must trace Nought, but the dire remembrance of thy loss.â EFFUSION III. On the Banks of the Wye. May 15, 1800. Along thy varying banks, sequester'd Wye, At eve, I wander mournfullyâfull oft Thridding the tangled maze, or under shade Of hoary oaks, that over-hang thy stream, Courting congenial gloom: but not, as erst, Or with the Painter's, or the Poet's glance, Noting thy wild varieties. No more Thy haunts romantic charm. No more mine eyes (Dim with their griefs) from tint or varied line Receive accustom'd joyance. Rocks, and falls, And deep-worn pools reflective, and ye woods Wash'd by the eddying stream, and you, ye hills Of fearful height, in wild perspective heap'd, Closing the sinuous valley, what to me Are all your varied forms?âAh! what the charm Of beauteous or sublime?âthe scenes that nurse Romantic vision, or invite the skill Of imitative effort?âOther forms Possess my weeping fancy: other thoughts, Rending the grief-swoln bosom, vail the eye In dim abstraction; and my troubled soul, Here while I rove, is absent; nor remains Ought but the wandering shade of him who erst Trac'd your wild haunts delighted. To that spot Where buds the white-thorn o'er the turfted grave Turn my sad thoughtsâthereâthere incessant dwell, While, with paternal anguish, oft my lips Breathe thy lov'd name, Maria!âOh! Maria! First born of Love! and fondling of my heart! In thee my hopes are blightedâblighted all The varied charms of Nature. All that once, With grace or mingled harmony, could thrill Sight or the list'ning sense, unheeded meets The unconscious organ; save where memory marks Some fond memorialâsome remember'd scene Of sweet endearment, where reclining erst (Pensive, perchance, beside the rushing stream, That moan'd responsive) I have heard the voice Of my lost darling, lisping kindliest notes Of soothing gentleness, that from my heart Chac'd every woe; or where, perchance, her form, Disporting gaily, with attractive charm, Full in my view has bounded:âjoy and health Blending with graceful loveliness.âAt sight Of such mute record, in afflictive trance, Groaning I pause: from my dim eyes, suffus'd, Tears stream afresh; and, down the echoing Wye, Woods, waves, and rocks repeat Maria's name. EFFUSION IV. During a severe Indisposition. May 18, 1800. Stretch'd on the bed of pain, restless I lie, Nor taste the vernal day-spring. Heavily Pass the lone hours; and thro' my wasting nerves The feverish langour steals. Yet not for this Heave I the frequent groanânor not for this Course down my wasted cheeks the channell'd tears, Dewing the uneasy pillow. Corporal pain, The woe of vulgar minds, with stoic pride, I well can combat: and there was a time, When never lonesome seem'd the pensive hour Of silent solitude. For then the Muse, On Contemplation's wing, would haply soar Into the realms of Fancy; bodying forth Ideal excellence, and into life, Calling each nobler feeling: or, more blest, With whisper'd voice, most musical, would tell Of future hopes (how specious)âflattering boons That the paternal heart might well repay For all its years of anguish. Ah! how oft In such sweet vision has my raptur'd soul Dwelt on thy form, Maria!âAh! how oft Imag'd thy rip'ning years; when every hope, That sweetly blossom'd in thy morn of life, Should bloom in gracious fulnessâwhen thy form, More fair expanding, and more beauteous mind (Germe of each kindlier virtue!) should secure (As did thy spring-tide promise) joy and love, And all the blissful feelings that reflect Back on the worth that wakes them. Ah! most blest When thoughts like these were present! Pain, and Woe, And persecuting Fortune, lost their power, And my torn heart was heal'd.âBut, she is gone! The balm of life is gone; and its sore ills Fester irremeable! Yet, not these I feel: Nought but thy loss is poignantâO! Maria!â My health!âmy joy!âmy fortune! all entomb'd! EFFUSION V. In the Vale of Taff. June, 1800. THE Blackbird whistles from the pendant groves That fringe thy varied banks, meandering Taff, And every spray is vocal. Thro' thy vale Smiles green Fertility; and, on thy heights, Of hoar sublimity, in varied form, Romantic Grandeur sits. Each object blends (Wild wood, and cultur'd farm, and rocky bank That mocks the hand of Labour) to adorn The vary'd scene, cheering the lonely wayâ If ought could now be cheerful. But in vain! Mountain nor vale delight, nor cultur'd scene, Nor Nature's wilder grace. In these sad eyes, The vernal year is blasted: from the blight That nipt my budding hopes in thee, Maria! Never to be renew'd. That heavy woe Hangs, like a cloud, upon my blunted sense, That tracing heeds not; but, amid such scenes As once to kindling ecstasy could wake The bounding heart, calls for sepulchral gloom, To my sad thoughts congenial: those sad thoughts (Constant to anguish) that around thy tomb (O! beauteous and beloved!) hover still, Nor hope for restâbut in such rest as thine! EFFUSION VI. On returning from a Journey to Merthyr Tydfil. June, 1800. TO my once cheerful home, at evening hour, Sad I return, and weary; from my brow Wiping the painful sweat-drops, for afar, Over thy heights, Farinioch, I have climb'd, With lonely tread; and, from the blaze of noon, Till now that Hesper rises, borne the thirst And turmoil of the day. Yet not for this Droop I despondent, or, with faltering step, Pause on the threshold of my lonely cot, Checking the starting tear. Not this I moan. It is the doom of man with toil to earn, With toil and care, the bread of his support; Nor must I claim exemption; but submit, Outcast of fortune, to the common lot That Fortune's outcasts bear. Of this let those Who less have mark'd life's checker'd paths complain: Had my poor heart no heavier cause of woe, I would not bend beneath itâbut, as erst, Smooth from the trouble past my wrinkled brow, And seize the present good. But nought is good! This trouble passes not: and Hesper's ray In vain conducts to my once-cheerful home:â For my once-cheerful home can cheer no more, And toil's reward is wanting. Hence, alas! Even on the threshold, faltering, I recline, While the heart droops within me. Where is now The shout exulting, that was wont to hail My home-returning steps? Ah! where those eyes, Kindling with filial ecstasy?âthat cheek, Flush'd with ingenuous glow? those outstretch'd arms, To which, with holiest rapture, I have rush'd, Blessing the name of father? Where is sheâ My soul's best darling! hope of all my hopes! Whose bosom thrilling with such eager joy, Wont to rush forth to meet me!âRound I turn, As my sad heart thus questions, to the spot, Where, o'er the church-yard wall, sad neighbourhood! The white-thorn budding marks thy early grave, Maria! Oh! Maria!âThere, entranc'd, Lingers the tearful gaze; reluctantly To the slow latch revertingâthe slow latch That, late uplifted, to mine eye reveals Nought but the sadness of sepulchral gloom! EFFUSION VII. On Stella's leaving me, to Visit some Friends, at Hereford, with a View to the Restoration of her Health. Llys-Wen. June, 1800. WELL thou art goneâgone to the City's throng, My soul's sad partner! mid the generous cares And kind solicitudes of pitying friends To sooth thy bosom's anguish. Be they blest Who in the wounds of thy affliction seek To pour the healing balm! and may they not The task of Love ply vainly. Me, the while, Here shall heart-eating Solitude consumeâ O'er saddest thoughts still brooding; or afar (Call'd by life's busy turmoil) over heights Of Alpine dreariness, my feet shall climb, To the once-peaceful vale, where sinuous Taff, (Stunn'd by Vulcanian clamour) writhing, shifts His devious course, and seeks for peace in vain. As vainly I. Nor this sequester'd cot, Mid circling scenes romantical, embower'dâ Once how belov'd!ânor Taff's remoter vale, Late, by the magic of Vulcanian art, Grown populousânor busy cares of Lifeâ Noânor the Muse's song, in this sad heart Shall ever more its wonted calm renew. Lost is the charm of Lifeâthe treasur'd hope That, o'er our shipwreck'd fortunes buoyant still, Sooth'd our lone bosoms. She, alas! is gone In whom (to every other comfort dead) Fondly we liv'd, and, in a dream of joy, Dwelt on the bliss-foreboding charms that bloom'd In her all-graceful form, and gracious mindâ Perfection's germe!âdeeming our night of life For such entrancing vision all too short. EFFUSION VIII. At Merthyr Tydfil. June, 1800. WHY, from imperfect slumber as I start, Shake my jarr'd nerves with terror? Why should thus The pale reflection of the waterish moon Gleam with ideal phantomsâbodying forth The shapes of things that are not? Bows the mind To second infancy? or cling the tales Of beldame Superstition to the heart, Scoffing the sceptic Reason? Time has been I slept and fear'd not; and, amidst the gloom Of tombs and sepulchres, could walk, unmov'd, At Midnight's darkest hour. But now the couch Of solitary slumber scares my sense, Grief-worn and dizzyâdizzy with the whirl Of ever-restless anguish!âFancy leagues With busy Memory; and the mind, diseas'd, Deems all her Shadowings real. Reason's boast Is mine, alas! no longer. My torn heart Feels, but reflects not; or, reflecting, dwells But on thy loss, Maria! and mine eyes, But half unclosing from a dream of thee, At my bed's foot still view thee.âI could thinkâ (For Grief, like Fear, its superstitions hath, That thrill, tho we believe not)âI could think Thou still didst hover o'er my unblest couch, And haunt my restless pillow: for sometimes Thy voice sounds plaintive in the midnight gale; Or, in the rush of waters, on mine ear, Steals in articulate moan; or else, thy shade, Transient and dim, but in proportion'd grace, Floats in mine eyesâmine eyes that fondly strain, Thro' the thick vail of tears, to follow thee, And realize illusion. Such, even now, Imagination view'd thy beauteous form, Faded and sad. Upon thy cheek no more Bloom'd the sweet rose of Health: but such thou seem'st, Pallid and wan, as when upon the bier I saw thee stretch'd, of every grace bereftâ Save the soft symmetries, that, even in death, Made thee all lovely. Yet not lifeless now Seem'd'st thou, tho pale: the look, the mournful air Was vital; and thine eye's expressive glance, In silent eloquence, upon my face Reproachfully thou turned'st; but yet found, And full of pitying dropsâsuch drops as erst (O! lost benignity!) were wont bedew Thy infant cheek, whene'er Affliction met (Maid of ingenuous mind!) thy sentient glance. Ah! such thou seem'st!âand Fancy, full of theeâ Fancy, that coins thy semblance, to my mind, The woeful look interpretsââWretched sire! âO'erwhelm'd with cares and sorrows! while thou striv'd'st âWith thy hard Destiny, with carking toil, âSolicitous, to snatch thy scanty means âFrom prowling Plunder, or the inclement rage âOf an ungenial season, unobserv'd, âUpon the vitals of thy dearest hope âSeiz'd the unbaffled pest; and treasuring that âThy soul so little values, thou hast lost âAll that thou deem'd'st worth treasuring.â Ah! most true! Thou, my sweet babe! art to my hostile stars Another sacrificeâanother fine (Heavier than all the past) that I have paid For love of human natureâfor the crime Of universal brotherhood, that, thus, Dooms me, in exile from the social sphere Of humaniz'd fraternity, to weep Thy early lossâin whom myself am lost. EFFUSION IX. After having spent a Part of the preceding Day in cheerful Society. Llys-Wen. Sept. 14, 1800. Transient, alas! and faint, what cheerful gleams Relieve my bosom's sadnessâwhether, bent On studious thought, I range thy lonely haunts, Sequester'd Vaga, or explore the page Of ancient Wisdom, or, perchance, inspir'd With love of sacred Freedom, yet unquench'd, I âbuild the lofty rhyme,â and twine the wreath Of civic virtue, for the honour'd brow Of Albion's earliest Hopeâor if, impell'd By hard necessity, with careful hand (To toil of late accustom'd) from the womb, Scant and ungenial, of an alien soil I force reluctant sustenance,âalike O'er every seasonâevery changeful scene Of various destiny, intrusive Woe Hovers with baleful gloom;âRemembrance still Dwells on Maria lost; and Fancy's self (No more, alas! creative) but renews That dire afflictionâbut renews the thought Of Thee, ingenuous maiden! early snatch'd From my paternal hopes, while yet the bloom Of sweet attraction on thy infant cheek Promis'd long-during bliss. Or if perchance, To this sequester'd solitude (tho rare) Journeying from far, some sympathizing friend, Cordial, approach, and of the times long past (Times not estrang'd to social intercourse) Renew the lost memorial, still my heart, To other thoughts incontinent, amid The flow of mutual converse, sad renews This woe of woes, and the unbidden tear, Or sigh spontaneous, mars the social grace Of hospitable welcome. Jest and Smile Are but abortions of the labouring brain, That would have ease, but cannot; or, at best, Delusive respites from the scourge of thought, That soon returns more poignant. Sleep herself, To my sad couch coy visitant! if chance She steep my temples in her opiate dews, Brings not the wish'd oblivion. Still, in dreams, Renew'd affliction haunts me. Still, in dreams, Rises thy beauteous form, Oh! best belov'd! To mock with faint illusion; and, the while My yearning heart throbs with a parent's love, I see Thee sink expiringâsee renew'd The writhing pang that, in an instant, chang'd Thy bloom to ghastly paleness; in these arms Leaving a wither'd flow'râa breathless corse! EFFUSION X. CERRIG-ENION: (Enion's Tomb) on Pen-Heol-Enion, in Brecknockshire. August, 1800. WHY, on the mouldering tomb of other Times, Sits my lorn wanderer, in the muffled robe, Vailing her pensive brow, and to the winds Giving, on such bleak height, the unshelter'd form Of feminine softness! Broods her thoughtful mind Some legendary fiction? or some tale Of Tragic record, pregnant with the woes Of virtue vainly brave? Or does she mourn Time's changeful progress, thro' these desolate Realms Too sadly mark'd?âwhere oft the enquiring eye (Seeking the ancient site of rampir'd wall, Or bourg, or populous city) meets, perchance, Nought but the brambled fosse, some moss-grown heap Of shapeless fragments, or some lonely hut, Turf-built, and thatch'd with fern, or with the wrecks Of prostrate palaces, now rudely heap'd, Without cement, or order, to enroof The toil-worn peasant, shivering in the blast That winnows thro' the walls!âor worse, perchance, Sees the rent fragments of those wretched hives Forlorn, and tenantless; while all around Stalks silent Desolation, unobserv'd, Save by the felon Kite, who, pois'd aloof, Watches his quarry'd prey, and makes the Air, Like the scourg'd Earth, depopulate! Such scenes Well might the wanderer mourn: and I, with her, (Making thy tombâEnion of Cambrian fame! My thoughtful couch) full many a dreary hour Could sit and moralize: but that my heart (My heart, alas! like hersâfor but two well Fancy can paint her musings) sorrowing dwells On pangs of home-felt sufferanceâWoes that bend Our hearts, united in one common grief, Down to the earth they sprung from!âwoes that blot The half of Nature's glories (thro' the vail Of sadness dimly seen) and dull the edge Of curious observation. Hence while here, With rude memorial, my unpractis'd hand Traces the Time-worn fragment, that still marks The Chieftain's grave, who, on this lonely height, Slumbers (in death still emulous) her thoughts Flee to the lowly vale, where, underneath The turf, unhonour'd, save by frequent tears, And ever-hovering memory, She, beloved! Our lost Maria sleeps. Oh! loss supreme! Never to be forgotten!âwhether thus We climb the dreary height, or trace the scenes Of smooth fertility, where Culture spreads Luxuriant, and the careful walks of Men Chace the still Solitude!âThee, budding flower! Cropp'd in thy sweetest promiseâThee, the fields, The groves, the wood-land wild, or dreary heath, The peaky Mountain, and the shelter'd vale, Alike shall mourn!âAlike, the village spire, The fern-thatch'd cottage, and the crumbling heap That stories ancient prowess shall renew The sad remembrance, echoing to our sighs, The mournful music of Maria's name. The HARP on the WILLOW. On being importuned, by a Lady, at Birmingham, for a Song of my own composing. May 15, 1800. IN Youth's vernal season, Hope's dawn brightly glowing, To each object around some new beauty bestowing, Awak'd in my bosom Love's delicate thrill.âOh! I twin'd the gay myrtle, nor dreamt of the willow. To the maid of my heart my fond vows then repeating, Her heart to my vows, in sweet sympathy, beating, We join'd in the song oft by bower, or by rill.âOh! We pluck'd the sweet rose, nor e'er dreamt of the willow. But Time, on all bliss that remorseless encroaches, Has clouded my noon, and my twilight approaches; Of many a woe I have felt the keen thrill.âOh! My voice is untun'd, and my harp on the willow! In exile I wander, from friendships divided; Ingratitude's shaft thro' my bosom has grided; And, while lonely I loiter by grove or by rillâOh! My love is far off, and my harp on the willow! Farewell ye gay strains, then, ye hopes brightly glowing! To the scenes of my youth once such beauty bestowing. My fancy no more with such visions must thrill.âOh! The rose and the myrtle are chang'd for the willow. INVOCATION TO HEALTH. Ah! where, rustic maiden! of hamlets the prideâ What heath dost thou rove? on what mountain reside? Dost thou follow some sheep track, and bound up the hill? Or wander, sedate, by the murmuring rill? Thee, Health! I invoke; and, thy foot-marks to find, Give my brow to the sun, and my locks to the wind. Then come, rustic maiden, whom anxious I woo, In thy beauty appear, and my transports renew; The balm of thy smiles o'er my senses distill, And wake in my bosom thy exquisite thrill: For Joy in thy loose-flowing vail is enshrin'd And sports in thy locks, as they float on the wind. But her carol is heard. Hark! in raptures how shrill It bursts on mine ear from the brow of yon hill. See, see, with light step, she descends from the rock, Where she sou't the young kid that had strayd from the flock: Of the wild thyme it brows'd, she a garland has twin'd, Whence her hair, half unbraided, floats loose on the wind. More bright is her hue than the brightness of dawn, And the rose on her cheek than the rose of the thorn; The blue-bell, besprinkled with dew, cannot vie With the lustre that beams from her love-darting eye; And sweeter her breath than the wreath she has twin'd, Whence her hair, half unbraided, floats loose on the wind. Cheerly smiling her mouth, as when first the young bloom, From lips tipt with orient, emit their perfume; When thy vintage, Siluria, first germs on thy trees, And we quaff the rich nectar in every breeze. So hopeful her smile, from the wreath she has twin'd, While her hair, half unbraided, floats loose on the wind. And see, as she brushes thro' woodland and brake, New fragrance bursts forth, and new beauties awake, Groves spread forth their branches their homage to pay, The buds are more sweet, and the foliage more gay, As emulous all in fresh wreaths to be twin'd, Whence her hair, half-unbraided, may float on the wind. The vales too rejoice. Hark! they join in the song, As she bounds from the copse, and comes tripping along; Peeping forth from their sod, cups and daisies are seen, And the grass, late so grey, is all vital with green: Flowers burst from each hedgerow, in wreaths to be twin'd, Or to sport in her locks, as they float on the wind. Yes, this is the mistress, my Stella, I woo: Yet no mistress for me, if not handmaid to you. If my bosom to warm with fresh rapture she seek, She must pencil those eyes, she must vermeil that cheek, With her wreath of wild flow'rs she those temples must bind, And sport in those locks, as they float on the wind. Come then, my lov'd partner! sit pensive no more, For MaÃ¯ invites, and stern Winter is o'er: Let us stray thro' the woodlands, and climb the green hill, From the Lark's early note to the Nightingale's trill. Comeâseek the sweet handmaid, where'er we may find, And give all your cares, with your locks, to the wind. THE ORPHAN BOY. [The following ELEGIAC BALLAD originated in a trifling incident, which spontaneously suggested the burthen, and the burthen of the Story. The Ballad itself may be considered as extemporary; having been composed during a walk to Worcester, while the Work it accompanies was preparing for the Press. The Author was not a little surprised to find, upon comparison, how nearly, in the outline, it resembles a beautiful little Tale already before the Public. During the time of composition, he was neither conscious of imitation nor of competition; but as he had certainly read Mrs. Opie's âOrphan Boy,â when it first made its appearance, he is willing to be beforehand with the Reader, in acknowledging all the Obligation he can possibly have thence derived.] ALAS! I am an Orphan Boy, With nought on earth to cheer my heart: No father's love, no mother's joy, Nor kin, nor kind, to take my part. My lodging is the cold, cold ground; I eat the bread of charity, And when the kiss of love goes round, There is no kiss, alas! for me. Yet once I had a father dear, A mother too, I wont to prize, With ready hand to wipe the tear, If chanc'd a transient tear to rise. But cause of tears was rarely found; For all my heart was youthful glee: And, when the kiss of love went round, How sweet a kiss there was for me! But, ah! there came a War, they say. What is a War I cannot tell; But drums and fifes did sweetly play, And loudly rang our village bell. In troth, it was a pretty sound I thought: nor could I thence foresee That, when the kiss of love went round, There soon should be no kiss for me. A scarlet coat my father took, And sword as bright as bright could be; And feathers, that so gayly look, All in a shining cap had he. Then how my little heart did bound: Alas! I thought it fine to see; Nor dreamt that, when the kiss went round, There soon should be no kiss for me. My mother sigh'd, my mother wept. My father talk'd of wealth and fame: But still she wept, and sigh'd, and wept; Till I, to see her, wept the same. But soon the horsemen throng around: My father mounts, with shout and glee: Then, gave a kiss to all around; And, ah! how sweet a kiss to me! But, when I found he rode so far, And came not home as heretofore; I said it was a naughty war, And lov'd the drum and fife no more. My mother oft in tears was drown'd; Nor merry tale, nor song had she; And, when the hour of night came round, Sad was the kiss she gave to me. At length the bell again did ring; There was a victory, they said. 'Twas what my father said he'd bring: But ah! it brought my father dead. My mother shriek'd: her heart was woe: She clasp'd me to her trembling knee. O, God! that you may never know How wild a kiss she gave to me. But once againâbut once again, These lips a mother's kisses felt. That once againâthat once againâ The tale a heart of stone would melt. 'Twas when, upon her death-bed laid,â (Oh, God! oh, God! that sight to see! âMy child!âmy child!â she feebly said, And gave a parting kiss to me. So now I am an Orphan Boy, With nought below my heart to cheer: No mother's love, no father's joy, Nor kin, nor kind, to wipe the tear. My lodging is the cold, cold ground; I eat the bread of charity; And, when the kiss of love goes round, There is no kiss of love for me. But I will to the grave and weep, Where late they laid my mother low, And buried her, with earth so deep, All in her shroud as white as snow. And there, I'll call on her, so loud, All underneath the church-yard tree, To wrapt me in her snow-white shroud; For those cold lips are dear to me. Amatory Sonnet. (The Idea from a Line in Shakespear.) âHIDE, oh! hide those hills of snow,â O'er which those sunny smiles, in vain, Dazzling shine, but ne'erbestow Vital warmth, to cheer the swain. With mysterious pangs they kill, Burning from excess of chill. Vail, Oh! vail those sunny smiles, Which that bosom cannot melt: Phosphor like, their chilly wiles Kindle fires they never felt: Lightsâthat, in the northern skies, Promise suns that never rise. Yet those hills of breathing snow, Yet those sunny smiles, so sweet! Could they feel what they bestow, Kindling touch of vital heat, Lapland nights themselves would prove All too short to tell my love. Another. [Bosom white as Alpine snow] Bosom white as Alpine snow, And, like Alpine snow, as cold, O'er which the careless tresses flowâ Tresses spun of palest gold: Like the threaded beams of light, That rest on peaky summits white. Snowy heights, for ever cold, Tho the sun appears so nigh, Far below which men behold Panting beneath the fervid sky! So those tresses, maid divine! Kindle every heart, but thine. O'er thy forehead, o'er thy cheek While those morn-like tresses spread, Ah! what crimson blushes break! And is no warmth beneath that red? Oh! icy maid of glowing mien! Amid the pangs you cause serene. But, if thus, by Nature's law, Suns by distance only burn, Hence, away with timid awe: Nature's lesson let me learn. Let me to those heights aspireâ Bask in the ray, nor feel the fire! THE FALL OF EGYPT; Or, Extinction of the Ptolomies. AN ODE. EGYPT is fall'n. Behold! behold The full accomplishment of woes! Wide-wasting Ruin, uncontroul'd, The refuge of the Gods o'erthrows. From the swoln wrath of Heav'n has burst Of all the worst of ills the worst. Hopeâeven Hope herself, is fledâ The hope, that ever sweet Repose O'er the land again should spread Her balm-distilling wing, our griefs to close, Or Memphis lift, again, her consecrated head. Mad Ambition's awless hand Hurls around the flaming brand; And, reekless, o'er the groaning ground, Fell Desolation stalks around. O! sacred Nilus! awful stream! Thou father of prolific floods!â Whose head adoring mortals deem Lost in the regions of the Gods! And shall thy torrents subject glide To yellow Tiber's sandy tide? Back, back, to their mysterious source, Your refluent floods, indignant, call! Ye Rocks! restrain their downward course; And you, ye headlong Cataracts! cease to fall: Back to your fountains flee, and change your thundering course. O'er sandy desarts, drear and dead, Your fertilizing waters spread:â There, there, in unknown deluge, burst, And satiate their eternal thirst. Soon, o'er those trackless realms of death, The living green shall, wondering, rise; Where never flow'd the quick'ning breath, Shall choral Riot cleave the skies; While some new pamper'd race (like ours) The bounties of thy Urn devours, Till, drunk with Plenty's baneful store, Enfeebling Luxury, at last, To some new spoiler gives them o'er, Opprest with woes prepar'd by blessings past; And thy new turrets bow, as Memphis bow'd before. Meantime let prostrate Egypt lie A barren conquest, waste, and dry; And channels parch'd, and plains adust, Repay the Victor's greedy lust. But seeâThe vision'd Vengeance glares! I pierce the mystic womb of Fate, Where Time, the embrion doom prepares, That soon shall whelm the tyrant state. Destruction hovers o'er the walls. She falls!ââThe victim Victor falls!â Alike, to such predestin'd fate Shall each successive Empire press: Hurl'dâhurl'd to misery's lowest slate With weight of their o'er-prosperous wantonness: By Triumph's self subdu'd, and crush'd by Fortune's weight. For such are Pride's eternal bars, That Greatness self its greatness mars; And, driv'n, by favouring gales, uncheck'd, On rocks of its own might 'tis wreck'd. For the first rough outline of this Ode, see the final Chorus, in Daniel's âTragedy of Cleopatra.â I ought, also, to have acknowledged, that, the fourth, sixth, and seventh Stanzas, of the âInvocation to Health,â were principally suggested, by a beautiful specimen of ancient alliterative metre, quoted in the third Volume of âPercy's Reliques.â Specimens of THE HOPE OF ALBION; OR, Edwin of Northumbria. AN EPIC POEM. THE HOPE OF ALBION. FOR the General Argument of this Poem, the Reader is referred to Hume's History of England, Chap. I. Title âHeptarchy,â Section âThe Kingdom of Northumberland:â where he will find sufficient, it is presumed, to excite some interest in behalf of the hero, and of the fable. If he is desirous of further particulars, the Author must refer him to Rapine, Warrington's History of Wales, and the Old Chroniclers; in almost all of whom some scattered facts will be found. When the Poem is published, in its collective form, the sources of historical assistance will be more particularly developed. ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST BOOK. SUBJECT proposed â The emancipation of Northumbria, by Edwin, the exiled prince of DeÃ¯ria, and consequent establishment of English liberty, and the Christian faith. Invocation to the tutelary Angel of Patriotism, and to those who superintend the social sympathies.âEdwin (having found refuge in the Court of E. Anglia) while indulging, in lonely meditation, on the banks of the Yare, his passion for the mysterious Emma, is interrupted by the Ghost of Albert, his former Tutor and preserver; who warns him, in mysterious language, of the machinations formed for his destruction. At the same time, he apprizes him, that the approaching hour is the crisis of his Fate; when, resign'd by the Chastening Angel to the trial of his own proper virtue, his election, to the high mission, for which his mind has been disciplined, must depend entirely upon himself. He then relates the circumstances of his own assasination by the Courtiers of Redowald; but trespassing upon his bounds of mission, he is suddenly called away by Ahimoth, the Brother of Death, or Angel who controuls the wandering spirits of the dead. Edwin, after bewailing the fate of his foster-father, returns to the palace, at Castor, formerly the capital of the Iceni, and now of East Anglia; where he finds the Hall crouded by the Ambassadors of the Northumbrian Tyrant. Of this book, the Proposition, Invocation, and Introduction of the subject, are all that are here presented. ARGUMENT OF THE SECOND BOOK. The corruption of the East Anglian Courtiers; and their hatred to Edwin, arising out of the amiable Character of that Prince. Redowald, having dismissed, unheard, three previous Embassies, sent to induce him to deliver up Edwin, the present Ambassadors are impowered to denounce the decisive alternative of War or Alliance. At the same time, the Fallen Angels, worshipped under the symbols of Saxon Deities, commission Meribah, the Angel of Discord, one of the Valkyries, or Ministers of Woden, with a train of subordinate Furies, to accompany the Embassy, and promote its object. The E. Anglian Courtiers endeavour to influence Redowald to listen to the proposals: and Hermanric and Ossa, the chiefs of the Embassy, in a nocturnal carousal, practice every artifice to bring over the Anglian nobles to their interest. When the morning arrives, they amuse the populace with a pompous procession; and, by the display of spoils taken from the Britons, and other inflammatory artifices, excite great commotions. They are assisted by the Demons, who, assuming human forms, mingle with the croud, and kindle their national animosities and rage for war. Meribah, herself, assuming the voice and gesture of Beornulph, still further excites and directs their animosities against the person of Edwin. The deluded populace surround the Palace, with seditious clamours, shouting for Alliance with Adelfrid, and a Cambrian War. The action of these two Books is comprised within the space of less than twenty-four hoursâfrom the twilight of the first, to the middle of the second day. BOOK THE FIRST. NORTHUMBRIA freed, and Edwin's patriot worth My verse records; his wanderings, and his woes, His martial ardour, and his faithful loves: How these, by powerful destiny, combin'd To form The Hero; who by virtue rose Superior to the fratricidal rage That sought his life, insatiate, and his youth Doom'd to disastrous exile; till arous'd To final effort, he their traitorous wiles Turn'd on the traitors' heads; and, from the strife Of feuds and deadly factions, haply wrought A nation's bliss: whence union, wisdom, power, Spread thro' The Seven-fold Isle; and cheering lights Of Holy Truthâand Liberty, and Laws. SPIRIT DIVINE! by whatsoever name (Sacred, or classic) thou delight'st to hear The votive salutation, O! attend, From those empyreal regions where thou sitt'st, Among the ministering seraphim enthron'd Who guard our sea-girt realm; and, by the side Of Albion, awful in cerulean robe, Shar'st (from primeval time) the trust conferr'd Of heav'nly tutelage; with helmed brow And missile thunder, from the horrent shores Chacing invasive Ravage; or the breast Of mission'd Patriot with sublimest rage, In perilous hour, inspiring, to confound Inborn Oppression, with triumphant arm, Or martyrdom more glorious. Thee I call, That, in the wrong'd Northumbrian's dauntless soul Breathing ethereal energy, inform'd His mind to worth and wisdom; such as ne'er Beam'd in his darker age; nor ever warm'd Chieftain, or sage, or hero of this isle, Anglian or British, till, in after times, Ina and Alfred in his godlike steps Trod reverent; and, by his example fir'd, Tower'd to immortal fame. O! then, descend, Seraphic ardour! from thy starry throneâ My theme's appropriate patron!âAs to thee Belongs The Hero, so inspire The Song. Nor You, ye plastic powers! that, round the hearts Of youthful lovers, weave the mystic web Of sacred Sympathyânor YE disdain To shed your softer influence. Haply, so, The trump sonorous, and the melting flute Shall breathe alternate strains, and love, and warâ The social feeling, and the public care, Each in appropriate numbers, sway the heart. NOW since DeÃ¯rian Acca, bath'd in blood Of holy patriots, with her tyrant lord, Bernicia's warlike chief, not less by crimes Than nuptial vows united, o'er the realm Of joint Northumbria (in like sufferance join'dâ In groans, and equal bondage) wielded first Their iron sceptre, many a sickening sun Had to decrepit Winter's ruthless sway Yielded our northering zone; while, fierce of soul, Collected in his empire's double strength, And form'd for martial enterprise, the chief Led forth his veteran bands to many a field Of blood-stain'd triumph, and enlarg'd his bounds With vanquish'd vassalage. So stood the throneâ Powerful in wrongs, and terrible in arms, And shook the circling states; while Tyranny Tower'd to prescriptive right; as tho secure In tacit confirmation: if secure Pow'r could be deem'd, or Domination stand, Unpropt of Justice. But the sense of guilt Intrudes, unceasing; and the injurious pair, Palsied with conscious terrors, inly pine, Brooding strange thoughts, with jealous frenzy big, And murderous precaution. But, o'er all, Their guilty terrors, and fierce hate pursue An exil'd brother, from DeÃ¯ria's throne Expell'd by treason; and by treason doom'd To infant massacre: but doom'd in vain: In vain had Bebba's towers (in riper years) Enclos'd the shipwreck'd wandererâpreserv'd By Chance, or favouring Providence, to thorn Oppression's couch with terrorsâor to hurl (Such visions mar their slumbers) on their heads The bolts of retribution. HE, the while, Escap'd from countless snares, thro' toils unheard And many a fearful conflict, unappall'd, Observant rov'd, thro' many an adverse realm, Hostile or kindredâwhere Diganway's tow'rs O'erlook blue Conway, and the headlong streams Water the Cambrian Vallies! or where, flow, With silver lapse, the Anglian rivers pour Their southern tribute; or, impell'd by Fate, Athwart the Scythian Vale, where Erin's chiefs, From bogs, and lakes, and mountains, their rough clans, Martial, collect, and, over wicker towns, And hurdled cots, hold a precarious sway. So roam'd The Hero: such his joyless youth: His early manhood such: wherever thrown, In every regionâevery soil and climeâ In every scene, with unremitting ills Hemm'd and pursu'd: in dangers, and in woes. Say then (Ethereal Patron of my Song!â My soul's best guide!) for what mysterious end His worth, unstaid by interposing Heav'n, Thus mourn'd disastrous? For a nation's wealâ For Albion's glory; yet in barbarous gloom Involv'd, and savage violence, and wrongsâ Unknown to arts and polityâtill he (Sage from well-during sufferance) shall ariseâ Freedom's first prototype: the first to found The sacred dome of Justice. Thence his youth And spring of early manhood, unsustain'd By prop or ministry (save one weak old manâ His sometime guardian,) bends beneath the wrath Of adverse Destiny: what time his mind, School'd by The Chastening Seraph, spreads, enlarg'd In wisdom as in virtue; and attains Ingenuous fortitude: alternate taught To pity and to dare. But now, awhile,â As tho some kindly power, from astral heights Beam'd brief benignity, his wearied worth In Redowald's court respires. Red'wald the goodâ Might goodness without fortitude reside In human bosom. He the East-Anglian throne Fill'd with a patriot's wish; and many a plan Of wisdom and beneficence devis'd In meditation's hour: but his weak grasp Pois'd not the sceptre's weightâon favourites oft Or female hands devolv'd. Such was the chief To whom (since now twelve chang'ling moons had fill'd Their horns, as oft retiring) Ãlla's Son Had fled for refuge, that no roof beside Nor Earth, nor Ocean, nor the cavern's depth, Might to his sorrows yield. BOOK THE SECOND. MEANTIME, Northumbria's heralds, in the hall Not unregarded wait. The fame, soon spread, Of pomps and royal presents round them draw The courtly tribeânot hopeless to partake. Nor lack they disposition to the cause, Or enmity to Edwin. Ill they brook His influence, or his virtues: for the youth (Whom now protracted sojourn, in the realm And friendly court of Anglia, had reveal'd In native colours) wins from every heart (All but the minion throng) cordial esteem, And reverence, and such love as waits on worth Unvaunting. The brave chiefs his martial port Wond'ring admire; and, in his ardent eye, Read his adventurous spirit, active, bold, Unweariable; and oft the sager ones divine, In tone prophetic, as, amid the train Illustrious of associate youth, he bears The wolf's rough spoils, triumphant, or shorn crest Of furious boar, slain in the sylvan war, That not unheard, in verse, or treasur'd tale Of hoar Tradition, his aspiring name Shall to the shades descend. Nor less the fair His graceful form approve, his manners bland, With courteous air endearing. Form'd to please, Nor less to please aspiring, well he knew To sooth the female ear, or win the heartâ And what he won to merit: champion still, Guardian and friend, not spoiler, was he found Of virgin innocence. But most he charm'd By manly probity: a heart that scorn'd Guile or disguiseâthat to its friend was friend Without reserve; and where he found a foe Was open, not revengeful: bold, not fierce. The love that waited on such worth but ill Brook the insidious crew; and less they brook That to his generous counsels RedÃ³wald's ear Was ever open: for he counsell'd not Such themes as courtiers useâas rapine, spoils, Oppressions, acts of power that overleap All bounds of law, and justify themselves On pleas of state necessity. All these His soul abhorr'd: So Albert's timely lore, And his own wrongs had taught. Instead of these, Justice, and Truth, and Mercy were his theme, And sacred Freedomâat whose awful name His great heart heav'd, and, with erected brow And eye that beam'd devotion, from his tongue Burst strains of eloquence, which whoso' heard Felt more than mortal fervour warm the breast. As yet the minion throng had bent beneath His happier influence, and their courtly arts Plied unavailing; tho not unsuborn'd By the usurping pair, nor unintent, With close cabal, or specious plea, to aid Their impious purpose; when, three several times, The restless tyrants (trembling at the bruit Of Edwin's fame) had heretofore assail'd ThÃ© Uffingian chieftain. He three sev'ral times Rejects their proffers, shuddering with disdain That paus'd not, nor thÃ© expecting council call'd To vent their hollow casuistries. But now Deeper their plots are laid; their agents chos'n With subt'lest policy; and, big with hope, Moves on the imperious embassy, empow'r'd, Against the scale of right, to counterpoise Int'rest and fear, seduction and the sword. Nor this their only trust: for bloody rites And magic incantations, ere they quit Northumbria's court, give hopes of prosperous aid, Counsel, or force miraculous, from powers Supernalâor so deem'd by erring men. Nor yet unmeaning from the reeking fane Issu'd the demon oracles: for, pois'd In midway air, upon their steps attend, Unmark'd, a goblin rout, the assiduous train Of Moloch, by the Saxon nations nam'd Woden (fierce homicide!) in classic times Mars, or the mountain god (thence Harees) long Worshipp'd on Thracian heightsâhis dwelling deem'd: BaÃ¤l or Bell, with oriental tribes, His name the while; beneath whose idol fane, In Babylon, the fiery furnace flam'd, Fearful to captive IsraÃ«l! With these (Misdeem'd of later years a fabled form Of allegoric fancy) Discord soarsâ Alecto erst, or of the furies chief That guard Valhalla, or the gloomy throne Of Dysâas Scald, or classic bard adorns The varying tale, by Superstition taught, Discolouring holy truths obscurely known: For she from highest Heav'n (a cherub once In titlÃ© and essenceâere her present name Was heard, except in Chaos) headlong fell, With all that rebel rout; her glory soil'd, And form celestial: first of all the host (Meribah, thence, and MeribaÃ¤l call'd, And Eber, by th' indignant files of Heav'n) To urge presumptuous war, and fan the rage Of Satan, when, ambition-fir'd, he sought To quell the omnipotent; and therefore fellâ He, and his rebel peers; and this withalâ Punish'd, not penitent: for still she broods Strife and contention;âwaging distant war On God most high, aye present in his works. So soars the dread Valkyrie!âas her chief, Hideous of purpose; nor in alter'd shape Less fearful, when, thro' lurid air she floats, A giant form. Round her colossal brow (Once with ambrosial locks, of orient hue, Twin'd graceful) now a venomous brood enwrithe With vip'rous hiss; and from her shoulders broad, Where erst the snowy plumage dropp'd with gold Beam'd radiant, wide the seared pinions spread, Bat-form'd, a huge expanse! and over hill, Champain, or grove, or dale, where'er she wends On impious errand, shed a noxious shadow. Fierce are her looks, and sullenâghastly fierce! Dark scouls her lowering brow; and, underneath, The restless eye-balls, that, dilated, gleam Two fiery meteors, ever rolling, seek Food for their wrath, while on each feature hangs Black tempest, rage deform'd, and rending storm Tumultuous. Such she seems (hideous and wild!) As when, in midnight blasts, the warring clouds Burst flaming, and the else untemper'd dark Bewrays the mingled uproar; seas, and skies, And riven rock, and mast of founder'd bark, And steeple' and tow'r split smouldering: woful scene! To her heart-cheering! which, when she beholds, She shakes the scorpion scourge, and, from her side, Snatches, in act to sound, the pendant horn Earth-shaking, that appals living and dead: The same which erst, ere man yet was, on high War and defiance breath'd, from angel hosts Apostate; and, first time, with alien sounds, Rude clamouring, tore Heav'n's concave; vocal ne'er, Till that disastrous hour, but with the strains, Holy and sweet, of love, and gratulous joy. Like wrath to breed in Albion, now the fiend Spreads her obnoxious pinion: in her rear, A throng of ministering fiends, that imp her flight, And do her fatal biddings; stirring up, Each in his sphere not idle, venomous thoughtsâ Panics, and rage, and wrongs; obdurate pride And jaundic'd jealousies; suspicions dire, And fears, and hates, the populous brood of Hell. By these (the gods of Acca) watch'd and warn'd, Proceeds the imperious embassy, on which Thy fate Northumbria hangs, and Albion's hope Of laws and holy truths, that from the bonds Of tyrant Superstition may redeem, And savage wrongs. So fear the demon gods Of ScandinaviaâHertha and her raceâ (So deem'd: herself of elder Ymer born: Born out of Chaos!) but more truly known As Belial's hideous train; obscene with rage Of brutal cruelty and brutal joys; Yet worshipp'd oft on many a torr sublime; In many a Karn; and oft, in runic verse, With fond alliteration, hymn'd and prais'd. Thee, Frea! thee they praise, embrothel'd queen Of wanton dalliance! and thy warrior spouse, Asgardian Woden, in his Hall of Shields, Horrid with blood; and cloud compelling Thor (Fruit of your loves connubial) and the rest Who, with septemviral sway, with magic rites, And impious festivals, alternate shar'd Diurnal homage; chronicled as yet In mystic calendars; profaning thus The shrine of holy Science with the weeds Of Pagan Superstition, false and foul! All these and more (ElvÃ¦, and antic Spritesâ Patrons of months and seasons) fear their doomâ Fear for their shrines and altars, runic spells, And homicidal worship. Therefore, sent To aid the tyrant's plea, th' infernal throng Fly sedulous; and feel a common cause. A common cause, not less, the minion train Who throng the court of Redowald confessâ Nor less malign. And now, by these inspir'd, They tower with bolder frontlet: hence no more Obsequious flatterers, to a masters will Who bow with silent awe. The palace rings With strains unwonted; and the royal name, Clamorous, they brand with censureâwho, unwarn'd, âAn alien youth protectsâperhaps for crimes âBanish'd his native land; unheard rejects âThe claims, perchance, of justice; turning, hence, âProffer'd alliance into deadly feuds âAnd enmities; the while East Anglia's realm, âMenac'd with dangerous league, must in new wars âPlunge, unconsultedâher existence stake, âAs yet unstable, from the recent strife, âWag'd with Icenian foes: and this, forsooth, âNot for East Anglia's glory; not to gain âExtent of wish'd dominion, and her chiefs âEnrich with foreign spoil; or further chace, âInto their savage wilds, the Cambrian tribes âDetested: not to rest on firmer base âEast Anglia's freedom, and her rights protect, âInviolate, from spoil of alien force:â âNoânot for this, nor these, must Anglian blood âFlow in the direful conflict, and our strength, âExhausted, perish in renewed strife, âEre from the old reviv'd. But grant it right, âThus, for a vagrant chief (for causes known âBest to himself) from every other court âExpell'd indignant; for a chief, erewhile, âAmong their untam'd mountains, taught and train'd âBy our inveterate foes, and doom'd, perhaps, âIn league with Cambrian legions, once again âTo shake the Saxon power; till all in vain âOur Uffas, and our Hengists, Erkenwins, âCerdics and Idas, chiefs of deathless fameâ âThe progeny of Woden, demigods! âIn the illustrious conflict shall have bled!â âGrant that it could, in such a cause, be right â(For one of dubious fameâa stranger chief!) âTo plunge in civil feud, and Saxon swords âBury in Saxon bosoms, were't not well âTo hear, at least, the embassy?âto weigh âThe cause in council? that East Anglian blood âNot unappreciate by East Anglia's chiefs âMay flow devoted; and our fate depend âOn other surety than an alien's will.â Thus, in the Court, they clamour, glossing o'er Their impious purpose with the specious shew Of patriotic care, and pious zeal, And tender love of justice: nor less loud Amid the popular throng; whom for their ends (Tho erst despis'd and trampled) they exalt, And woo with artful blandishmentsâtheir ears Filling with fearful wordsâstrife-stirring sounds And cabalistic jargon; such as aye Traitors in pow'r, state jugglers, trumpet forth, When in the popular mind they seek to raise Ideal terrors, phantoms of alarm, And baseless apprehensions. By such arts Sway they the unstable mind of RedÃ¶wald, Else self-determin'd and persuade to hear The embassy in council; there to weigh War or alliance, the propounded terms For Ãlla's Son protected or betray'd. 'Mid these cabals not idle are the twain, Or of their charge unheedful. Thro' the night, While, with the social chiefs, wassail and meed They quaff, in gay carousals, Hermanric Probes every heart: as pride or interest sways, Mirth, or the genial rite, or thirst of fame, Or enmity and deep corroding hate Against the race of Cambria, he enflames Their several passions: here the costly gift Timely presents; some martial trophy there; And there the spacious bowl. Less sordid, these Are won by shews of friendshipâcordial words, The statesman's cheapest bribes. Some well-tim'd praise Quaint tales or jests convivial some allureâ A jocund band; while to another group Of martial deeds he vaunts, âof Bangor's fight, âWhere Adelfrid o'er slaughter'd thousands strode, âHumbling the Cambrian crest; while, cowering, fled âBrochmael, thy prince, O, Powys! to their fate âLeaving the tonsur'd crew; twelve hundred priests, âCrosier'd and cowl'd; who, with their impious rites âAnd chaunted incantations, hope to fray âThe sons of Woden. To the insulted god, âAn acceptable offering, these our king âBravely devotes; then, on the buckler'd host, âSprings, like the brindled wolf, who, having flesh'd âHis warrior tusks with blood, and thinn'd the fold, âNext on the herdsmen turns, that round him throng, âIntent with missile weapons to repel âThe bold invader: these, with conquering rage, âFiercely he tears; their sylvan war defies, âAnd chaces to their huts; well pleas'd to find âInglorious safety. So the hero rag'd: âSo to their woods and mountains chac'd the tribes âOf Cambria's boastful warriors. Dee's broad waves âRan purple to the sea; proud Bangor flam'd; âAnd Legan-Cester, trembling to its base, âConfess'd the Saxon pow'r. Nor scap'd the chiefs; âBut, by the outstretch'd sax mow'd down, or crush'd âBeneath the pond'rous mace, groaning they fell, âIn conflict and in flight, a royal carnage! âFirst bled Gwendellau, fierce Caradoc next, âMadoc and Modred, strong Derwyddon, Ludd, âMerion and Mathraval; Rhiwallon next, âRenown'd for brutal rage; and Howel's son, âProud Cunvan: swift Ardiffrid then we slew, âO'erta'en in flight; and, making fruitless stand, âCadwallader, and Rhun, and Ruthfedel; âAnd stern Cadoffin, tall Usgathrog, Mawr, âEnion and CadifforâArglooddi all, âFam'd in their clans, and Bards, whose epic songs âInflame the martial ardour. Cadvan's selfâ â(Your Edwin's patron!) who, with all his hosts, âFlush'd with predicted conquest, from the north âCame foaming (like the torrents from their heights, âSwoln by autumnal rainsâan upland sea!) âStood all aghast; and, doubting Merlin's faith, âFor his own Snowdon trembled and retir'd.â Thus Hermanric. Fierce Ossa hears with joy The boastful tale: but most his soul exults In Bangor's massacreâher slaughter'd monks And conflagrated monast'ryââwhere all âTheir arts,â he cries, âtheir spells, and endless rolls âOf Nechromantic jargon, a vast pile âOf impious mummery, in the flames expire. âGrim Woden smil'd, and Thor, with furious joy, âConvuls'd the air; while Coifi, from the herd âOf trembling captives, snatch'd the victim chiefs, âAnd on our altars slew. So perish all âThe race of Cambriaâand their vagrant friends!â Redden his eyes at this: his eyes that glare, Inquisitive, around: and, where he marks A kindred disposition, there he turns, Insidiousâpledges deep the wassail bowl, And grasps the hand in amity; the while, With low'ring brow, and darkly mutter'd words, He seeds the smouldering sire. To such, he drops Close-whisper'd hints of âTraitors!âCambrian spies!â Or tells some tale âof canker-worms destroy'd, âOr vipers crush'd!ââNor lacks the ambiguous theme Comment of glancing eye, or gnashing teeth, Or hand that grasps the poignard, half expos'd. Thus waines the night. But, when the ruddy day Resumes his empire, thro' the crowded streets They bend their course; and to the public gaze, Display their purpos'd presents: chiefly those (Banners and arms and trophies) from the foe Ta'en in the Cestrian fight. With these they hope, Not idly, in the popular mind, to rouse The sullen passionsâscorn, and deadly hate Of alien tribes, and national pride that steels The obdurate heart, presumptuous, and confounds Reason and right; moulding the infatuate herd (Their own worst foes!) to the pernicious views Of crafty politicians: whence the woes That thin the human raceâoppressions, wars, Famine, and fire, and pestilence; whate'er The Good with horror view, the Great with pride. Meantime, not heedless, with the gaping throng Mingle the ministÃ©ring furies; their foul forms Vailing in human mould, and shifting oft, As spirits wont, and their malignant views Best prompt them. Now, in lowliest weeds, they mix Among the lowest, and, with sordid speech, Quaint idiom, and obscener mirth, disguise Insidious malice; now, in martial strain, Boast their exploits, and shew the mimic scar, Feign'd from Icenian shafts. Anon, they seem Sages, or Priests, that of impending ills Bode, reas'ning, or, from divination, feign Woes darkly shadow'd. Still, in every form, Their own bad passions into every breast They breathe, infectiousâpride, and causeless hate, Contention, scorn, and envy, and the drought Of wildering rage, that thirsts for guiltless blood. Such passions, by the passing pomp inspir'd, (For so he deems) the crafty Hermanric Beholds self-gratulous: nor does he lack To watch the spreading fire, and, timely, heap Fuel of words accordant; vaunting oft âNorthumbria's glory, and the martial fame âOf Adelfrid, from East to West wide borne âOn wings of Triumph!âCaledonians, Picts, âAnd martial Scots pent in their Grampion hills; âThe Saxon name spread to the northern isles; âAnd Cambro-Britons o'er their barren heights âChac'd timorous, on the sea's extremest verge âTo pant for short-liv'd safety.â So he boasts (Bruiting a tyrant's worth!) and interweaves Words oft of soothing praise, and dearest love Borne to East Anglia's tribe: and much he talks âOf wish'd alliance; of confederate force, âAnd Cambria's remnant crush'd beneath the weight âOf Anglia and Northumbria join'd in arms.â Mantles each cheek at this. The demon stirs In each inflated breast; nor stirs unurg'd; For swift the infernal crew the closing words, Exulting, catch; and, with reverberate shout, Rend heav'n's high arch, denouncing âCambria's fall âBy Anglia and Northumbria!â The fierce throng Kindle with martial rage. All join the peal, And swift, from man to man, contagious wrath Spreads, direful: as, from group to group, expands The electric fire, when to the crystal jar, Or sphere excited, the hermetic hand Applies the tried conductor, and relieves The imprison'd element, whose subtile flames Dart thro' the languid nerves, the fibres brace, And with encreas'd pulsation urge the heart. So these, excited by mysterious fires, Glow with unwonted fury. Loud the name Of Adelfrid they clamourââAdelfrid! âAvenging Scythe of Woden! Cambria's Scourge! âHope of the Cimbrian race!â Meantime to arms, Urg'd by the demon crew, with breathless haste, All fly delirious. Thro' the crowded streets Helmet and hauberk gleam, and burnish'd sax, Spear, and the ponderous mace. The clanging shields Bray hideous; and the city teems with war. Then swells the heart, vainglorious. Each beholds, In fierce imagination, thy proud towers, Diganway, fall; while, o'er the perilous heights Of cloud-girt Snowdon, expectation pours The martial deluge; and the hapless race (Hated for wrongs and sufferings!) seems extinct. Meantime, in different groups, the demon throng Essay their boldest arts; and, for their ends, Assume the port and gesture (well devis'd) Of minion courtiersâa seditious crew, When to their ends directed, the dread storm Of popular rage may swell! Now here, now there, Clamourous they fly, inflaming more the fierce, Urging the bold, and with insidious speech, Guiding the whirlwind passions. But o'er all, Gifted in specious malice, and the rage Of festering hate, the seeming Beornulph shines: Beornulph, for unrein'd insolence and pride Conspicuous ever: turbulent of tongue, And school'd in subtile sophistry, he knew Each popular art against the popular cause, Skilful, to turn; to deck the altar up Of bloody immolation in such guise Of luring pomp that the poor hecatomb Bleat for the sacrifice; and while they deem Themselves the God, not victims, on the knife Rush self-destroying. Such appropriate form Assumes The Master Fiend, who, heretofore, Aloof, suspended on inveterate wing, Beheld the tumult thickeningâbest to guide The Ministering Mischief, or the frenzy urge When to full crisis raging. This perceiv'd, She her infernal in such semblant form Subtly invelopes, with infuriate force Of hell-instructed eloquence, to goad Delirium on to madness; and the wrath, Kindled by wiles demoniac against The race of Cambria, on the head divert Of Edwinâerst so favour'd: popular love (Ah, boon precarious!) to the deadly gall Of hatred turning. Thus disguis'd, her head, While fierce the tumult rages, o'er the crowd Lifts the dire fiend. The spell-bound crowd attend. âAnd what preventsâye warriors! what prevents âThe wish'd alliance?âWhat forbids the Sons âOf Elb, united, to their fame to rush, âAnd Cambria's instant fall? What but this blightâ âThis outlaw'd Edwin? who, in Cambria's court âUprear'd and nurtur'd, to the Cambrian race âInclines with partial favour: in his heart âAlmost a Briton! adverse to our Gods, âAnd from our altars alien! He it is âThat with his foreign counsels fills the ear âOf credulous Red'wald, urging causeless hate âAgainst Northumbria's king, brave Adelfrid! âWhom, as it seems, the popular voice preferr'd, âFor martial virtues, and deep rooted hate âOf Cambria's tribe, to fill a double throne; âAnd, haply, for collective strength, to blend, âAgainst the common foe, DeÃ¯ria's sons âWith those of fam'd Bernicia. He, it seems, âOwns not the national will; but would oppose, âAnd, with hereditary claims, dissolve âThe happy compact. Hence, from court to court, âSuppliant, he flies, with well-invented tales âOf wrongs and woes, storming the womanish heart âOf Pity; hoping thus the Saxon league âTo split in hostile factions; and, by force âOf alien swords, with lurking treasons leagu'd, âTo gain his ends ambitious. Thus may weâ âShield clash'd with shield, and sax with sax embroil'd, âThin our victorious ranks. Meantime the foe, âFear-chill'd no more, burst from their icy chains; âAnd, from Mervinian heights, shall Cadvan pour âThe wasting deluge o'er our fertile vales âExulting; and, too late, our civil rage âQuench in promiscuous ruin: better far âTimely extinguish'd: better, e're the spark âSpreads into flame, in its own smoke, confound âThe latent mischief. Hence Northumbria's, peers âPronounce him traitor. Hence each Saxon realm, â(East Anglia's court excepted) timely wise, âSpurns him pernicious. Even Erin's chiefs, âThat range the swampy forest, and the hordes âOf Scandinavian rovers, who the sea âFrom Mang's rude Isle infest, their aid refuse. âBut we, my friends! we on this forlorn hope âHeadlong must rush, and these our scythe-like blades â(Whence our heroic name) must turn to mow âNot Woden's foes, but Woden's kindred ranks: âAn impious harvest. Doff then the stern helm: âPile up your arms: Hauberk, and axe, and spear, âIn idle state, hang in your chieftains' halls, âAnd let the warrior sax rust in the scabbard: âSo Edwin willsâor clang your brazen shields âFor him, and not for Adelfrid. The front âOf perilous war turn not against the tribes âOf fugitive Cambria; but against the Chief â(Favour'd of Woden) who the Cambrian tribes âPens in contracting bounds;âand would destroy, âBut for intestine treasons!â Thus declaims The latent fiend, well acting, and appears, In phrase, as voice and gesture, Beornulph's self: Clamourous and false: the demagogue of power! Then, plunging in the crowd, to thinner air Resolves the borrow'd form; and over head Floats, a dark cloud, wide low'ring: such as oft O'er Skiddow's top (divine of coming stormsâ Lightning, or hail, or fall of feathery frost Cold-piercing, or the deluging rain that swells Autumnal torrents) at the close of eve, With darkening swoop, stoops threat'ning: fearful sight To the way-wearied traveller, whose eye, Haggard and cheerless, scans the houseless waste. Meanwhile her trump sonorous, with loud blast, The fiend inspires; wide-spread, her harpy wings Flap joyous; and with more than mortal force She swells the boisterous din. The crowd confess The hovering demon. Wide, and wider spreads The torrent rage, with shout, and deaf'ning clash Of brazen shields, that uproar shakes the earth. Then onward, by the maddening pest impell'd, Foaming they pour, and with their clamourous rage Circle the royal palace: like the sea, That breaks its banks, and, round some frontier tow'r, Beacon, or spire, roars with tumultuous rage: Wave rolls on wave, and, flood impelling flood, Onward resistless spreads: fierce breaks the foam (A briny shower) dash'd from the batter'd base, Till from its height, the threaten'd pile stoops tottering. So they, impatient for the Cambrian war, Foam mad'ning: while for Adelfrid they shout, Till with percussion of the beaten air The palace trembles. Red'wald hears astound: Nor ill divining the insidious cause, Ponders with painful doubt; and with his breast Holds fearful council. So a swarm of wasps, By hunger urg'd, around the industrious hive Throng martial, and, with brandish'd sting prepar'd, Breathe thro' their tiny horns the threatening blast Impetuous; while within the regal bee Fears for the foodful store, and, ere she calls Forth from their waxen cells and frugal toils The warlike train, debates, with quick consult, How wiseliest to repel impending woe.
