      <field name="fulltext">Ista tamen mala sunt. Quasi nos manifesta negemus: Hæc mala sunt: sed Tu, non Meliora facis. Mart. l. 2. Ep. 8.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My Stock of Wit is small; let them who flout My Poverty; be pleas'd, to bear Me out.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">OWEN'S EPIGRAMS: THE FIRST BOOK. 1. To the most Illustrious, the Lady Mary Nevill, my ever honoured Patroness. I want no Patrons, for to vouch my Books; No places Rudeness, denies gracious Looks. My Papers to the Reader, I shall vow; The Dedication of my self, take you. 2. To the Reader. If you applaud what ever I have writ, I must deride your Indigence of Wit: If you praise nothing, (then the cause stands thus) Your epithite shall be, The Envious. 3. To Counsellor Hoskins concerning his Book. This Book is the Mad World; these verses Men: Choose Man, or verse; scarce one found good in ten. 4. To the Lady Mary Nevill. Suppose Pythagoras the white did kiss, When he talkt of a Metemsychosis; The proof is facile, that you are the same with Pallas, Junos and the Lemnian Dame. For Three rich Vertues shine in you, alone; When many Threes, cannot lay claim to One. 5. To the same. As Phœbus revels in the arched skie, And with him light, quarters her Majestie: So ador'd Vertue proclaims it a Grace; That shee's incumbent to your charming Face. Whoever tell-tale Fame invites to see Your Ladyship, bowes to captivity: If he evade your Beauties Fetters; yet, Inward endowments cast a faithful Net. 6. To her Ladyships Son, Mr. Tho. Nevill. Your Genius is so eminent, that due Belief is banish't; though the story's true. He that will praise a Childe, doth Hope commend, And not the Merits; which must crown the end: Not Hope, but real Worth doth magnifie The happy Torrent, of the Ingenie. 7. To her Ladyships Daughter Cæcilia. The Mother you are like: when I say this, Avant as useless, all Periphrasis. 8. Nosce teipsum, upon Harpalus. To some this (know your self) were good advice; But in the application, be you nice: You are not worthy Knowledge; seek abroad, Something that is, may once fall in thy road. 9. To the Lawyer. If he be happy that can Causes scan, You ken to plead our Causes: Oh brave Man! 10. Upon John Protus. I well remember Protus, you did threat, That shortly, nothing should your wedding let: Your Latine phrase, in my brest creates strife; It signifies to Marry; Lead a wife. VVhen Ale hath Crippled you, but in small stead You'l stand, your VVife, or any one to lead: Nay, shun such thoughts; and get a sober Spouse; VVho in the dark may lead you; find your House. 11. Upon Aulus, an ignoble Nobleman. For Honour (sordid Aulus) which you share, To Predecessors, you indebted are. But your base Spirit hath contriv'd to let Posterity, from living in your debt. 12. Upon Hernicus. You Hernicus, did disburse twenty pounds To buy a Fool, what squander without bounds? In time, thy lavish Error, prethee see; I would not give, such a large Price for Thee. 13. Venus. Sowre is the Exit, though sweet the address, Of the salacious Cyprian Emperess. She dresses up the first salutes with Joy; Till the sad parting proves her a Decoy. So sweet and dulcid Rivers, when they thrust Themselves on Neptune, borrow salt disgust. 14. To Doctor Gilbert. You say the earth doth move; what wonders slip From your sage mouth! writ you this in a Ship? 15. To the Physicians, and the Lawyers. Our Sickness is thy Health, O Galen: prise Our folly Plowden; for that makes ye wise. 16. O Times! O Reformation! Renowned Scaliger, in the worlds Eye, Was the Refiner of Chronologie: The shrivel'd Face of Time is washt. The Man That will correct the Manners; finde who can. 17. The Judgment of Paris. When Pallas, Juno, Venus, did refer Their cause to Paris, chose him Arbiter; At first, his dazled eyes could not descry, Which radiant Beauty, did the rest outvy. The Majesty of Juno, yet at last, And Pallas Wisdom, mist the winning-cast. The golden Apple's Venus Trophie. Love, On earth is Victor; rules the Gods above. Were Judgment now reverst, the Golden Lump Would win: and Juno Money turn up Trump. 18. The German Truth. Merry Democritus, affirm'd Truth did In some deep Hogs-head (from Mens view) lie hid. Grant but the Adage true, that Truth's in Wine; Upstarts the Dutch-man, and swears, Truth is mine. 19. To Linus. Linus hath his Study fill'd; but what then? Not Books, but Bags, make the most learned Men. 20. To a certain young Noble-man. That until hoary Hairs you spin out Breath, All your acquaintance wish; but none your Death: Conjoynt desires, will afford a disease; As for the Cure, to wish that none will please. 21. To a certain poor Medic. You who of late came to our City Poor, Now cleanse the pores; ('tis not as heretofore) Physick you give the Sick; the sick gives Gold: You cure his New disease; and he, your Old. 22. Upon a certain Woman. Your Beauty begot Fame: but soon, alas, The Mother, by the Daughter, murder'd was; Whilst a loose Carriage, threw Ink on your Name; And a good Face, was scratch'd, by a bad Fame. 23. Upon Marcus. Why durst you offer Marcus to aver, Nature abhorr'd a vacuum? confer But with your empty skull; then you'l agree, Nature will suffer a vacuitie. 24. Upon the Writers of our times. To the Reader. Whether our Scriblers vent more Lies, would'st know, In an Octavo, Quarto, Folio? Thousands of Lies are nothing; in an Age, Time bound in the Decimo-sexto Page: If that the Sixteenth part, such knacks can do; What can a sheet's, Gigantine Folio? 25. Upon Phyllis. The world can't bribe Phyllis to kiss; But she Will receive millions; if they profer'd be: For cunning tricks, pray let this Lass alone; Give, and Receive, she understands all one. 26. Upon the same. If Love be fire, (as Proverbs talkt of old) Accurst am I! 'cause your fire burns so cold. 27. The impious Atheist. Snatch instant Time; use things whilst in their prime; The time wil be, when thou shalt have no Time. Resume let Grammar, Have been, Shall be; I, To secure Is, will fix my industry. 28. The Epitaph of the Atheist. He died, as if there were no Future state; And liv'd, as one invincible by fate. 29. The Optative Mode. The Mode call'd Optative's the same welnigh, With that Mode, cousin to Infinity: Instance in those, of most contented minde, Yet such, an end of wishing, ne'er could finde. 30. Upon Alanus. All the day-long Alanus, now a wife; Rails like a Bedlam, at a wedded life. After so many brawlings; in the night, They that think Marriage a fine thing, think right. 31. Prophets, Poets. The Prophets predict true, what is to come: Poets, in Fictions sing, what hath been done. 32. Upon Life, and Death. Life hurries on to Death; the foaming floud Of Neptune, so, is Rivers period: We ruminate on Life, as a sweet notion; But to all tastes, Death is a bitter potion. 33. Of Vulcan. Most glorious armour, was by Vulcan made, For the fierce god of war; Mars drives a trade, And gives him no less famous horns: How now, Take Horns for Steel? not such a fool, I trow. 34. The Grammar in English. Things only proper unto Males; The Female Sex claim, as their Vales. 35. Free Will. Free-Will, the nurse of sublunary Strife; A man is cheated of, by his own Wife. 36. Of Life, and Venus. All actions labour, to atchieve their ends; But Life, and Venus, are to it no friends. 37. The Elysian Fields. Grand-sire Ænæas, (thank Poets) did come, And view the levels of Elysium: But in those times, he gave Elisa due Benevolence; the fiction proved true. 38. The Cuckold, and Cuckold-maker. The Cuckold. This Wife I married; she doth me forsake: Not for your selves, O Bees! you hony make. Cuckold-maker. These Boyes I got; another reaps the praise: Not for your selves, O Birds! do you nests raise. 39. The new Rhetorick. Hee that wants mony, labours but in vain, In disputations for to squeeze his brain: Not he, who knows to speak; but who, to give; Under the roof of Rhetorick, shall live. 40. Upon Cotta, lately turn'd a Monk. Cotta, vext with his treble-tongued Wife; Betook himself to a Monastick life: To see this hour, 'tis happy you were born; If putting on a Hood, you put off Horn. 41. The Arms of Geneva. Geneva Bears the Eagle; and the key: The first proclaims, Emperial Majesty; Unto the last, the Mitre, is right Heir, Which is successor to St. Peter's Chair. Of pure Geneva's Arms, what will become, If Cæsar takes the Eagle; the Key, Rome? 42. Upon the Poet Borbonius his toyes. You call your verses Trifles; be they so? Ask your self privately, and you'l hear, No. I shall refrain my verdict; yet I may Take leave to think, what you thought good to say. 43. Faith. Fides, for Fiddle-strings, is Plural; when It Faith denotes, 'tis singular; say then, Our Predecessors were Emphatical: They held a single Faith; that Faith was all. 44. Upon Paulinus the Physician. Call you a sick-man Patient, since hee Is so impatient, of his Pains, and Thee? With much adoe, you are endur'd: you may, That he's your Patient, positively say: His spirits by his sickness, are much spent; But 'tis the Doctor, which doth him torment. 45. Upon Cottula. If Delphos did not flatter Socrates; The attribute of Wise, claim when you please; Proud Plato's Master may stand in your Row: You know for certain, that you nothing know. 46. Upon Fabiana. Land bearing much, was fruitful call'd of yore; Good Fabiana! Thou hast born great store. 47. A Joque, upon the Covetous. VVhat foolish humour, makes men so intent, Natures contentedness to complement? Whilest on the other side, but few are nice, To cast stones at flint-hearted Avarice. But little Nature craves; well, you'l grant us, That nothing will suffice the Covetous. 48. To a Lover of his Countrey. 'Tis Honour to dye for my Countrey; fit: Suppose Death may my Countrey benefit. Yet to Live for my native Countrey, I Humbly conceive more pleasant, then to Dye. 49. The World. No certainty; the world's turn'd upside down: What wonder then, that there no good is known? 50. Upon Aretine. Things have their scantlings; but our trials find, A measure hateful to fair Venus mind. Lust hath invented 1000 tricks; a part, May Nature challenge; but the greater, Art. 51. Upon Silius. Papists you might not be; nor could you love The Protestants; thus Atheist did you prove. 52. Upon Atheists. No house stands without owner; and will you, Unto the worlds great House, no Lord allow? 53. The Physician. Sir Mountebank will take gold, but none gives; Physick will give, himself, without it lives. The paunch Quack empties; his Pouch the diseas'd; One thing, to crave anothers help, is pleas'd. 54. The Counsellor. Lawyers by Law, are Jurisprudents named; By their great wisdom, Bumkin's title's lamed; Let who will smart, they for themselves provide; No greater prudence, in the world beside. 55. The Courtier. If you be Good already, then in time, You will be better; but scarce higher climbe: If you be great already, in time you, May become greater; but scarce better grow. 56. Upon one-ey'd Marc. One-eye wants honest Marc; one may suffice; Discern more things, not better, can two eyes. I have two ears; yet with those never cou'd Hear truth of things: two eyes; yet see no good. 57. Upon Paul. Lest that your Name should perish, edifie You will a tomb, fond man! that tomb, must die. 58. A Receipt against Baldness. To Bithynicus. No fear in age you should be Bald-pate cal'd; Your youth (O happy Man) hath made you Bald. 59. Upon Theodorus. Theodore marrying, was of the minde, That now he heavens narrow way should finde. After experiment, the owl could say, He found the road to Hell: the curst, Broad-way. 60. Apollo and the Muses. Females are the Muses; Apollo Male: Nine Muses can he single, counter-vale. 61. Upon Alanus now grown old. Alanus wishing his cold limbs no harm, Desires his wife to turn; his place is warm. Here's wit at will; Girls must not at Age spurn: But last night Alan's wife had a good turn. 62. New-years-Day. To the Rich, Olus sends no New-years-Gifts; Lest they should think he were put to his shifts. Sending the poor 'tis Prudence to neglect; From them, requital he can scarce expect. Quintus to send, makes it his yearly task: What he's asham'd to beg, his Gifts shall ask. 63. Upon Pontia. His Wife told Pontius, there was a Law, All Cuckolds should be thrown, where Surges aw The Mariner; Pontia in love to him, Cry'd out, For God-sake Husband! learn to swim. 64. The Work of Darkness. To preserve species from wing'd decay, Then Individuums what's fitter pray? Yet nothing more mischievous is, then these Soft Individuums, to Species. 65. You Lie. Beware to Souldiers, lest you give the Lie; There's no disgrace like this indignity. You Lie, it seems, is a detested phrase: To Lie, you love; that's little, no disgrace. 66. Upon an Hypocrite. All Swearers, Superstitious you'l controul; Yet, Lie all weathers; a religious Soul! 67. Upon an Hermaphrodite. Androgynus may boast himself the Race Of Mercury, and Venus, by his Face. Not Male nor Female; (Bless me!) what's he then? Ask Maids, a Man; a Woman, ask but Men. 68. Venus. Love hath his Flux, and Reflux; Venus bred Was in the soyl where Tethys layes her head. No credit Venus merits; her descry You may, 'twixt Sol, and seduc'd Mercury. The Planets are her Cronists: none so far Can scout from sense, to call her fixed star. 69. Upon Rivals. All Sutors, Phyllis would appropriate: Call you it Love? 'tis Envy at this rate. 70. A Woman. In that rich Language, which victorious Rome, Bequeath'd to those, Cæsars did overcome; A Woman drew her name from Softness; 'cause Mans brawny hardness they excell; by th'Lawes Of benign Nature. Why so? 'tis well known, Eve was not Adams Flesh, but his hard Bone. 71. The Relation betwixt Physicians and Lawers. The Lawyer, and Physician, for their pains; Pick out of others Losses, legal Gains. The Medic, heals the Body: Lawyers prate, To cure the Falling-sickness of Estate. Both will assist each moment, whilst you live; If you subsist, each moment to Give, Give. 72. To Philip concerning Pamphilus. Nature defies a Vacuum: We see How sweetly She and Pamphilus agree. 73. To Bald-pate. Trees regain Hair; &amp; Fields the verdant Grass: But when will your Head Leaf'd be, as it was? 74. Nilus in my Eyes, Ætna in my Brest. A briny Nilus overflowes my Eyes; Whilst with Ætnæan flames, my scorcht heart fryes. Rivers of Tears, quench not my ardent Heat: Nor my Loves Fire, dries up my brains salt sweat. Water and Fire, in temper disagree; Yet will accord, so they may torture mee. 75. If all things be alike. Upon Camilla. Two Swashes did the fair Camilla court; The one was handsome, but in stature short; The other Features could not boast at all; But (like a May-pole) was exceeding tall. Camilla being question'd, which would do? Exactly view'd them both, from top to toe. Observing in the one, a Roman Nose; Long legs, long arms, she prudently him chose: And modestly reply'd, None can mislike The proper man, if all things be alike. 76. Of Gyants and Dwarfs. Two monstrous creatures, land at Natures wharf; The Gyant, is an Oxe; a Dolt, the Dwarf. 77. Upon the spurious Off-spring of an Abbot. VVhen you pray with the Covent; O how true Is Abba Father, when pronounc'd by you! 78. To Parsons. A priest, by marriage, did himself great wrong: For wifes before did to his Tithes belong. 79. A Participle. A verb is Eras; Mus, a Noun; pray pass Your Censure Reader, what Erasmus was. 80. A Cause for the Lawyers. A goatish man, led his own wife by chance, (Supposing her his neighbours) Cupid's dance: Admit a Childe the product of this Fate; Is it a Bastard, or Legitimate? 81. The Morning. Is it a wonder, light breaks forth before, Phœbus begins, to blazon mountains Or? Light as an elder Brother, did out-run, By three daies journey, the life-giving Sun. 82. Of Day. Let night with Argos have an hundred eyes: Yet more with one, a duskish day descryes. 83. Of Night. Hath Night no other gown, but black aray? Alas poor Widow! dead's her Husband Day. Were not Stars Lanthorns, to the mourning night; We likewise might be vext, before Day-light. 84. Upon Marcus. Your Verses praise me, Marc; I know these wayes; You are so kind, that I, your verse might praise. 85. Death. Petty theeves may restore; nay high-way men: Death never will; what a Jade is she then! 86. To his Friend. Half you, your Mistress claims; your self I fear, The other half; what part fals to my share? I reade you mine, in Complements thick sown; But are you Mine, when you are not your Own? 87. A good Man. If scarcity will estimation bring; Beleev't, a good Man is a precious thing. 88. Upon a certain old Man. Your beard, once black, cold age hath frosted gray; Your mind, once white, is turn'd to black, they say. 89. Upon Paulinus. Whatever old acquaintance beg of you; Yes, yes, to morrow; Paulin will it doe. Must I be grateful, for the Gifts you send? My thanks, until to morrow; I'le suspend. 90. Upon painted Dames. You who delight to paint, need not forbear To cry with Horace; Shadowes, dust, we are. 91. Upon Cotta. Cotta his Wife is wholy; but not sole; Camilla soly his; I can't say, whole. 92. The Politician. Dissemble what you know; let falshood range; To finde the yeelding grain of every change. Feel the pulse of all times; that all may bee, To thy desires subservient; good to thee. 93. Upon Venus. Venus and Mars, play the unlawful game; Because in lawful sporting, Vulcan's lame. 94. Upon two Masters. No man can serve two Masters; I confess, Marinus saith, I serve two Mistresses. 95. Upon Marc. Your beard grows fast, hairs fall off; thence is it, Your beard becomes so long; so short your wit. 96. To Jo. Hoskins. At Winchester, a Boy; at Oxford, I Being a youth; found your Fidelity. In doubtful matters, you shew'd sincere love: And sans deceit, to your trust true did prove. Of sending this small gift, Love was the ground; To me, Love ty'd you; Me to you hath bound. 97. Of Death: To Epicharmus. Epicharm will not die; yet his own Breath Wishes exhal'd; would die; but not by Death. Sorrows bring death; Death sorrows makes to fly: Far worse then death, is grating Misery. 98. Upon Phyllis. The Parthians flying, backward cast their darts: By flying, Phyllis wounds her Lovers hearts. 99. Upon Hallus the Grammaticastre. Hallus, whilst hungry, cry'd, I'm hugely fam'd; I'm hugely full; when his guts were reclaim'd. 100. Of the Load-stone. As from all Iron, Load-stones do exact Coition: so, Lords all the Gold, attract. Courtiers I ask ye nothing: for ye are Stingy in giving; what ye ask, ne'r care. You give for your own ends; I cannot see Gifts retrograde; I shall scarce ask of yee. 101. Death. Ask Me what Death is? pray stay till I die; Come ask me then, your suit I sha'nt denie. 102. The Client. Clients returning, before theefs may sing: For back from London they can't money bring. 103. Upon Zoilus. I blame bad manners; Zoilus you repine; Perhaps misdoubting, that, I aim'd at thine. Then all the world, you are more fearful grown; When I chide Vices, I may mean my own. 104. Children and fools tell Truth. The English Proverb, cals such Fools, as tell The very Truth; a Liar bears the Bell. Therefore if you speak Truth, to English Men; You may be for your labour, Fool cal'd, then. 105. Upon Bald-pate. You had a thing, call'd forehead, when shook down, The leaves were not, from your well-shaded crown. But since the hair fel off; (with reverence,) 'Twixt head, and fore-head, there's no difference. In jumbling head and face, age hath mistook: No credit can be given to your Look. 106. To the same. How many hairs I have, I can't divine: Nor you, (for all are lost) canst number thine. 107. An Apology for Fortune. Bad Fortune is a fancy; she is just: Gives the poor, Hope; &amp; sends the rich, Distrust. 108. Upon Cotta. Cotta went to a Bawd, to be befriended; But did not return with his business ended. 109. Upon Procillus. A Noble. If you, Procillus! would no Liars hear: That hellish brood, your presence would revere. 110. To Paul, the Lawyer. Your practice eats the year; your worships salf, If for your own, you Register, one half Your Wife will claim Vacations; by all Lawes, You must be vacant, to attend her Cause. The other part's ingrost; when as a Quirk, Non-suits your Wife; succeeds your Clients work. The years most busie months, are cal'd aright, A term: They terminate your Wifes delight. 111. To the same. A Lawyer, Terms; Vacations, never sees: But alwaies findes the Leisure to take Fees. 112. To Marinus. As oft as your abused Wife, bewails Your impotency; you shall feel her nails. In vain you flatter; good words nothing can; She must, and will have Satisfaction, Man! 113. The Chirurgion. My Trade will flourish; Jove send peace, send war: Venus, and Mars, both my kinde patrons are. 114. The Venereal Disease. Born an Italian; bred in France; quoth Fame, Which Country strives, to give the Pox a name? 115. Calumniators. Flatterers. Old Anaxagoras, that snow was black, Related; most like him, love truth to wrack. Old Reynards suffrage, the Crow white decreed: How many thousand Foxes, Our age breed! 116. Upon Ponticus. You have repented: I sha'nt credit it; None can repent, but they must have some wit. 117. An Herculean labour. If strong Alcides, his wifes tongue could tame; A thirteenth labour, might augment his fame. 118. War, Death. War brings forth famin; famin is the cause, That thrusts poor mortals, on the plagues sharp jaws: Then plague, or famine, two-edg'd war is worse: The humane glutton, supreme Jove's choice curse. War is the Alpha, of succeeding Wo; Death the Omega of all trouble: so, When Canons thunder, to fly Mars counts cheap, From Alpha, to Omega, at one leap. 119. Upon Cynthia. The gods conform your Nature, to your shape: And to your Lilly-hand, be your minde, Ape. 120. Upon Gellia. You sin unseen; that is a feign'd pretence: You never sin, but some give Evidence. 121. Upon Albinus. O Albin! Felix cry'd, your neighbor burn; Home, home, with speed; for next will be your turn. Albin surpris'd his Horn-maker, at home; And cry'd, Wise Felix! Faith my turn is come. 122. Upon Claudius, the raw Philosopher. Good, hath three species; which are inclin'd, To sojourn in the body, estate, mind. Sick, poor, and silly, Claudius we see; He cannot challenge one, among these three. 123. Upon Bardella, the Mantuan Thief. A Monk, Bardella, to be hang'd cheer'd up; And said, To night in heaven thou shalt sup. Bardel reply'd; This, I keep fasting-day, If you please to accept my place, you may. 124. Upon lascivious Flora. You tell of all your Bed-fellows; and so, More hurt by prating, then by acting, do. 125. Upon Quintil. Quintil's friend can get nothing; Quintil's Lass, Hath got himself; and what e'r worth he was. 126. To Aulus; concerning old Quintius. Can't Quintius marry, at decrepit years; But Aulus, you must sting him, with your jeers? Why Epigrams? Epitaphs, best befit, Old doting Lovers, that have lost their wit. An Elegie, (in all haste) let him have; For he hath dig'd already, his own grave. 127. Upon Costus. Scotfree he sins; that's all Costus can plead: But this fail'd, when, you know what lost its head. 128. An Answer to Cynthia's Letter. You sent white paper, but black was your Letter: Your heart, and body; nothing express better. 129. To Sextilianus, A spurious Brat. Your Father, never purpos'd to create You, Sextil! But himself, to recreate: If we not Gifts, but Donors mindes, respect; To Thank him for your Life, you may neglect. 130. Upon Portia, an Hypocrite. Fie! fie! your wit is bawdy: Good now grant My Book that; which your Husband must not want. 131. Saturn's three Sons. The corrupt Lawyer; dubious Divine; Cheating Physician; the whole world enshrine. 132. Of single-life, to a certain married Man. The wisest King, saith, Wo to him alone: Follow St. Paul, and Wives ye shall have none. The wedded Man, cries, Wo to us; whilst he, Who staies a Batchelor, cries, Wo to me: Our wo is single; but yours is not so: You, and your Wife, must share a double Wo. 133. Upon Corneus. Hear, see, say nothing; observe for thy Life: Since thou hast got a wag-tail to thy wife. 134. Upon Caius. When lean Informers, Caius did espie, To have two Wives; the Court they certifie. Caius confest; and resolute, them told, What they condemn'd, he did most lawful hold: One Wife, St. Paul, a Bishop will allow; I hope then, I, a Lay-man, may have two. 135. Upon Pomponia. Pomponia sets her self to Farm; who's able To praise her joyning Sweet, to Profitable? 136. Upon Pinotus, sick of the Cholick. Pinotus regain'd health; by losing winde: A Life, in that, which others kils; you finde. 137. Upon Pomponia. Look how the Feather, daunces on her Hat; 'Twas Mars his badg; but Venus now gives that. 'Tis to grace Mars; Venus it deigns to wear: This shews how friendly, Mars, and Venus are. The Crow thinks her young ones fair. Cicero Juscul. Quæs. lib. 5. 138. To H. L. Your neighbours wife, best contents you; and he, Counts yours most fair; thus nobly ye agree. Tully to prove his words, may now despair; Some Birds (it seems) think their own chick's not fair. 139. Venus. You may hire Wenches, as well as buy Wines: Why hath then Bacchus; and not Venus, signs? 140. Things of worth, are hard to come by. To Marinus. If that fair Girls are nice, I'l choose the coy. You may take leave, the coming to enjoy. 141. Upon Theodorus. To marry, Gospel will not you allow: Not a pin-matter; the old Law will though. But you have transgrest Moses Law, before: Your last wife was a widow; first, a whore. Lev. 21. 7, 13, 14. 141. New-years-Day, to Germanicus. I send you verses, instead of a gift: Return me gifts; verses, you off may shift. 143. Sara. She that will let her Husband kisse her maid; We shall scarce match, (good Sara) I'm afraid. 144. To D. T. You are your very Scholars servant; and As your Lords School-master, you may command: Whilst thus you serve as Low; command as High; Your Titles I both pity, and envy. 145. Upon Paula, the Atheist. A maid, two husbands, or a man two wifes, Whether should have; to solve it Paula strives: If you grant not a maid two Husbands; how, Can in one flesh consist, the Plural two? 146. Vertue consists in a Mean. A superb woman, praunc'd betwixt two men; Vertue her Medium had banisht then. 147. Upon Acerra. To's Father Acer, single did aver; Happy is he, whom others horns deter. 148. To Pinotus. What Lass is for my Mony? such an one, As all would buy, but vendible to none. 149. Upon Quintus, and Quintina. Quintus kneels to his wifes commands, as though Commission from the Gods, she could avow. Her words are Laws; poor Quintus trots about; Thinks himself blest, his eyes are not scratcht out. 'Tis against nature, manners, vulgar speeches; Good Priscian never give, women, the breeches. 150. A Paradox. To his absent Friend. I burn in Love; the more flames my desire; By how much further, I go from the Fire. 151. Upon Paulina. Paulina her first husband, made a Stag; Nor had the last, any great cause to brag. She was as hard as horn, to first, and last; But all the Interregnum, she was chaste: Yet not for vertues Love, but her own sake; Knowing her Tinder, would but touch and take. Although most urgent Gamesters, came apace; In her Vacation, she would give no Place. 152. Upon Gellia. If to take Gifts for Benefices, be, (Or such like things) accounted Simonie; Then you are guilty; who no fault at all, Count to sell Love: for love's spiritual. 153. Upon a certain Woman. With wondrous speed, in stature, large you grow: Omicron the last year; Omega now. 154. A Riddle. To finde this creature, whither should I sail, Whose Father is a Woman; Mother, Male? 155. To Ponticus. It Startled me, when your two eyes, I spy'd: Since that your Father, Mother, were one-ey'd. 156. Upon Mr. Calf. I shall not say that horns sprout on your skull; But this I'le swear to; that you are a Bull: What though a Bull? I shall not call you mad; Although of late, your Cow, 3 Calves hath had. 157. To a certain man, concerning a Dactyl. Would'st Latin verses to thy Mris. show? 'Tis worth the while, what foot will please to know. All women love, men should in Dactyls court; Which have one long syllable, and two short. 158. Love Descends. Love begins in the eye, by th'mouth descends; Until at last, she in her centre ends. 159. Upon a stammering Woman. Balba took leave, of Phi-phi-philip, thus; Make quick return, and Cuc-cuc-comfort us. 160. A problem for the Lawyers, concerning Theft. To take a thing without the Lords consent, Is Theft; what if the Lady be content? 161. To Ponticus. You promis'd fair, but nothing will give me: Galen gives nothing; yet cries, Recipe. 162. Upon Cerellia, married to Gallus, an Eunuch. Had not we (fools) the Spartan fashion loath'd; Then parties naked, should have bin betroth'd. Cerel in thought, had married a game-cock; But Cock, prov'd Capon; craven'd by a Smock. 163. Of Horns: A Problem. A wife is light, her husband wears the Horn; Why so? He is her head; it must be born. 164. On New-years-Day, to Germanicus. Your gifts, or else my Verses, let me have: Upon that same condition I them gave. 165. Christ-Church Colledge in Oxford. Imperfect you were left, in Wolsey's daies; Yet you may claim, a Quadrangle of Praise. 166. Upon Phyllis. Phyllis with pleasure, doth my Rythms rehearse; But she loves Venus, better then a Verse. 167. Of Himself. I spend the Time in trifling; and lest those Years of my Life, should perish; I them lose. 168. To the Reader, concerning himself. I think this Brevity, my Fame can't hurt; 'Tis not a little Labour, to be curt. The vulgar talk much, to small purpose; I, Perhaps talk Idle; yet use Brevity. 169. Upon Thraso, the Braggadocio. Don't Thrasos gingling Heels, make a fierce show? Glory to all, is an huge Spur; you know. 170. Of Himself. James the Apostle saith, Ask, and Receive: O that K. James to me, would grant like leave. 171. The Court-Musick for two Voices. One Courtier cry'd, When others climbe, I shall my Self advance. T'other reply'd, My Rise must be, A Favourites mischance. 172. To the Reader. Let not my Book, Tobacco light; but rather, Let it the Refuse, of your Close-stool, gather. 173. To his Book. My Life perhaps, may my Books years, out-vie; The Son, before the Father oft doth die. But whether it dies first, or sees Me Rot; I understand, A Mortal, I begot. THE SECOND BOOK. 1. To the Reader. Let my Verse not please Fools; the world is full; I would not be the Darling, of a Gull. Few Readers will suffice; grant me but one; If no body me like, I'm pleas'd with None. 2. To the Lady Mary Nevill. Others Renown, is but the Poets praise. Your splendid glory, your own Merits raise. 3. To the same. If you have Enemies, they need not fear; To oblige friends, you make your chiefest Care: This you observe; Friends, never to Forget: Ne'r to Remember, with Foes, to cry Quit. 4. To the same. That a fair Face, might beauty keep alive; The curious Pencil, helps it to survive. I though a stranger, to the Limners Trade; To keep your Fame alive, in Verse essay'd: Although Apelles Pencil, one Divine, Should Draw: Apollo's Verses her enshrine. 5. To Mr. J. H. No whit portentous, but a Poet I: You are no Poet; but a Prodigie. 6. What Newes? All that know Me, my Patience thus abuse; Good Mr. Owen! hear you any News? I Answer, I know None; and tell them True: Of all I know, for I know nothing New. 7. The Court. He, who to all Mens Humours, can't stoop down; Hath got a foolish Humour; for his own. 8. Upon Aulus. Why were you made a Knight? because that more, Your wife might love you, then she did before? But you mistook your self; Sir Aulus, she, Will love her self, the better; but not thee. Former expence must double every yeer: You shall have cause, to call your Lady, Deer. 9. Upon the Chymist. It is the silly Chymists doting Fate, To seek for Gold, and Lose his whole Estate. None must Elixar have, but He alone; Till all away is squandred; Stick, and Stone. 10. A Trojan. After Troy's burning, the Trojans grew wise: In this, True Trojan, who Himself denies? 11. The Cure of Love. By frequent Fastings, take wood from the Fire: Let not a Ladies Glance kindle desire. If still, your Fervour will not let you rest; A Wife will quench the Flame. Probatum est. 12. Troynovant. To the Londoners. No Phœnix beautifies, the gilded East; Before Sol lights her Mothers fragrant Nest: So decimated Troy, the Grecians burn: Majestick London, sprouts from Troy's pale Urn. 13. The Lawyers God. A deity cal'd Term, Rome did adore: But now at Westminster He's Worshipt more. 14. The Earth. To charm our Tongues, the middle hath a Spell; For there we think, the golden Mean doth dwel. Therefore in play for Praise, earth throws an Ace, Above the Heavens: here's the Middle place. 15. To King James, De. of the Faith You are Faiths chiefest Guardian; to intrust, Her, with your sacred self, Envy thinks Just. 16. To the Lord Treasurer. A treasurer, whom Vertue makes to hold, Vulturian Talons, from the Regal Gold: Is Himself greater Treasure, then can shine, In the Rich womb of an Exchequers Mine. 17. To the Kings chief Secretary. The Secrets of three Florid Nations lie, Committed to your Tested Secrecie. The Kings thoughts are not safe, till in the Chest, They be lockt up; of your most Tacid Breast. 18. To the Venetians. A fair laid your Foundations, at the first. Neptune, turn'd Foster-father; and them nurst. Nor shall mute Fish, the Sea Monopolize; Your Palaces, make proud waves pay excize. The Sea now fetter'd, gives a City Birth; Art baffling Nature, water turn'd to Earth. Your Empire survives time; waves ebb, and flow: Yet never dare unconstant prove, to you. It is not strange, Venice her self, loves Lawes; Since she, the out-law'd Ocean, over-awes. 19. To the Lord Chancellor. Lest that the Quirks, or Rigour of the Laws, Should accidentally, Injustice cause; Deservedly it in your power doth lie, To bridle Common-Law, with Equitie. 20. To the Lord Richard Sacvil, Earl of Dorchester. Your Ancestors were Noble; you, we see, The glory of renew'd Nobilitie. For you, (which was a Wonder in old time, Seems now Prodigious, to our vicious Clime) Rewards attending Merits, disrespect; Love prudent Lawes; devasting Arms neglect. To prefer Vertue, before Power, think good; And Learning's Jewel, before Noble Bloud. 21. Cecil Lord Treasurer. 1597. Arms abroad are invalid; unless that Prudence at Home, and Cecil, steer the State. Cecil, is Atlas Brother; born Above: Cecil, Props up Elisa; Atlas, Jove. 22. Upon the Lord William Cecil's Motto. Virtute Duce, Comite Fortuna: Vertue my Leader, Fortune my Companion. Divine Elizabeth, Fortune did grace, (Your wisht Companion) with an Earls high place: Since there was None, her Pleasure durst Rebuke; Why made She not, Vertue your Leader, Duke? 23. To Richard Vaughan, Bishop of London. You British Honour! are the first from Wales, Arriv'd at Londons Sea; through happy Gales. 24. To the same. Those Doctors alwaies pleas'd me, who account, Their good Lives, their good Sermons to surmount. Most learned Bishop! you, not only teach, Others their duty, but by Life do Preach. 25. To Tho. Bilson, Bishop of Winchester. You were my School-master; let who will, know; All these I write, I to your Precepts owe. 26. The Life of William of Wicham, formerly Bishop of Winchester; publisht in Latine, by Tho. Martin, Doctor of the Civil Law. That a dead Man, a Person should have freed, From deaths black Dungeon; few wil make their creed. Had you not don this work, in Lethe's Brook You had bin drown'd; now both, live by this Book. 27. Winchester Colledge. Europe's chief School, our Winchester appears; Where I was honour'd to spend younger years. To give her the first place, Zoilus is bound; Suppose he knows, great Wicham, did her Found. 28. Sir Philip Sidney. Because old Homer did his Praises sing, Achilles was thought happy, by the King, Of large Æmathia, Poor wretch am I, Whose Muse can't divine Philip, Deifie. 29. To the same. VVho acts things, worthy to be writ, or writes, Things worth the Reading; on no small bliss lights. No Plummet sounds your Repute; who alone, By a rare Genius make these Two, but One. Readers your Writings covet; ev'ry Act, Might all Historians Table-books, exact. Your writings prove you Learned; Deeds attest, That Prowess Anchors, in your noble Brest. 30. Upon the Marriage of William Earl of Pembrook; and Mary, Daughter to the Earl of Salisbury, 1605. For Nature, Wisdom, Beauty, Age, Estates, Nobility, ye are most equal Mates: Yet Sir, I this confess; you have not wed So Nobly, as deserv'd, your Bridal-bed. And I acknowledge Madam; that you are, Worthy a Husband, yours, excelling far. 31. To Elizabet, Countess of Rutland, Daughter to Sir Philip Sidney. Rate Philip's Praise, did not on Error trip; Since he was Father, to your Ladiship. That was his Honour: Yours is for to be Daughter, to such Heroick Chivalrie. 32. To Lucia Countess of Bedford. Light gave (as God-mother) your honour Name; That through the world might shine, your Lucid Fame, You for your Birth, to noble Parents owe; But wit, and Vertue, you the Light, did show. 33. The Knights Ring. To Sir Henry Goodyear. Let Honour be the Gold, Vertue the Stone; Until that Ring, your Finger leaves alone. 34. To Mr. J. H. Your Verses deserve well, yet want Applause: Some Writers are much prais'd, for little cause. 35. To D. B. If he who keeps things close lives well, then you: You hide your Faculties, they greater show. 36. To Th. M. the Princes Tutor. To a Decorum, you the Prince do bring, Will make him of himself; as Britains King, Rule of himself, all other will out-vie; This one, excels the Four-fold Soveraigntie. This one laid in the Balance, will weigh down Babylon, Persia, Grecia, Romes proud Crown. 37. To the same. Now Age makes our Prince docil, his green youth Imbibes grave Precepts from your learned mouth: O Teach him so! that future times may say, Our King is great, good, learned; which bears sway? 38. To Mr. Walter Gwyn. You make the Princes happiness compleat, By Prophesies In an Anagram, that Mr. Gwyn made in Scotland, before the Union of it, with England., flourish in Arthur's Seat. Nature hath given Parts; let Fortune be As much profuse, in her Indulgencie. And as the Prince grows bigger, I wish you, May swell in Honour, and still greater grow. 39. Francis Drake. 1581. Drake hath embrac'd the Word; and did espy, Both Polar Tenter-hooks, which hold the sky. If men be silent, Stars will blaze thy Fame: And Sol will Trumpet, his Dear Comrades Name. Drake did but bait at Calpe; and may cry, Great was Alcides; true, but Greater I. 40. Britains Strength. To the Prince. Havens, are England's Gates; the Navy, Wals; Sea, Tents; works, Bodies; and Hearts, Admirals. 41. The Terrestrial Globe. Water, &amp; Earth, make but one Globe; 'tis strange; For Earth moves not; the waters, always range. 42. The mad way to Health. The more Healths in your Belly swim; the less Shall your drown'd Body, dwell with healthfulness: I envy not your thousand Healths; to me, A single Health, is a sufficiency. It is the only Health, no Healths to drink: In drinking Healths, there is no Health; I think. [Your knowledge, is a Cypher, without you] 43. The Divine. Your knowledge, is a Cypher, without you, To light your Brothers Candle, it allow. The Politician. My Brother shall be hang'd first, before I, Reveal one tittle, of my Mystery. 44. All things desire that which seems Good. Doth Optimus from Opto steal its Name? The Best, to Wish; in Latin ne'r the same. Why may not this be so, since none can rest From Wishing; (except Fools) what they think Best? 45. A Black Swan. A maid of Burgundie, lean as a Rake Made by Green-sickness; was advis'd to take Sedum minus 2 M. which some vow, As rare an Herb, as can in Gardens grow. The Pious Maid, her Doctor did deny: Chose before sin, Sins wages; and would Die. 46. Democritus, and Heraclitus. Democritus, laught at what e'r befell: Plague, Famine, Murders; stil the World went well. At Feasts, at Weddings, brewing brinish Tears; Sad Heraclitus, with sore eyes appears. Shall we weep for Heraclitus? or thus, Shall we laugh at merry Democritus? 47. Upon Langa. Langa a Papist, wedded to a Man, That did Profess himself a Lutheran. To prevent Future strife, Husband! said shee, I'l make (for once) this fair offer, to Thee: Grant me but Free Will, and then there's an end: About the other Points, I sha'nt contend. 48. King Arthurs Round Table. VVhy did Heroick Arthur, so much care For a Round Table; and rejected square? Not without Reason; for Gods work is Round: But humane heads, the Quadrature have found. 49. To Theophila. B. C. He must be zealous; in Brains no whit dull; Who can ye Love; or praise unto the full. 50. Upon Hernicus. His Soul to Heaven, Body, to the Grave, Commended Hernicus; about to leave This sinful world: but hearing that his Wife, Would quickly period her Widows Life; In very anger, he recal'd his Breath: But before that, he was resolv'd for Death. 51. Of Love, and Faith. Love, and Faith, are divorc'd; we know it thus; Faith is suspected; Love, suspicious. 52. The Lover. Uncertain Hope, short Pleasures, constant Fears, Joy-grief, sweet Pains, fall to poor Lovers shares. 53. The Golden Age. When to fill Bags with Gold, men did not rage; Why did they call such Times, the Golden Age? 54. Upon Alana. Nature ordain'd you, to Lie under; yet, At Table uppermost, be sure, you'l sit. Thus Man, and Wife, finde out Pacifique waies; He rules the Rost, by Night; She rules the Daies. 55. The German Death. To Polynicus. Not to be, Death; grave Seneca did think: But Germany supposeth, Not to drink. 56. Upon Philodemus. Of scarce Commodities you hate the Price; But to take common (if cheap) are not Nice. I'le tell you what, (because a friend of Mine) A cheap costs more, then a dear Concubine. 57. Upon Long-tongue. Battus talks like a fool; and then of course Comes out; Pray pardon Sir, my long Discourse. No want of Pardon, should to you belong; If you could learn the Art to hold your Tongue. 58. The Gordian Knot. Was the strain'd Gordian Knot, rather unty'd By the Kings Wit; or did his Sword divide? Without wit you may untye this Knot: but, Were Alexander here; He could not Cut. 59. Love. War, Peace; Peace, War; such faults are found in Love: For Love, from strife; doth seldom far remove. 60. The Laws, The loss of Quiet. To the Lawyers. Strife, breeds Laws; Laws, Strife; without strife, no Man Useth to live; without the Laws none can. 61. The Covetous, and the Prodigal. The Prodigal affects high, polisht strains; Nothing but Rhetorick, coms neer his Brains. The Covetous, in Logick, takes delight: And scrapes up Syllogisms, day, and night. For Avarice, Logicks close fist, we call Suadas broad Palm, denotes the Prodigal. 62. ?????. Labour, or Trouble. Pain, was scarce Labour; to most Active Rome: To Idle Greece, Labour was Troublesome. 63. A Good man, Valiant, Wise. Good men, have seldom wealth; or stout men, wit: And to Beleeve a Wise Man, few think fit. 64. The Order, of the Golden-Fleece. From Philip Duke of Burgundie, saith Fame; The Order of the Golden-Fleece, first came: His Heir, now wears, Rich Peru's Regencie: This was no Order, but a Prophesie. 65. Tho. Earl of Dorchester's Motto. Nec Temere, nec Timide. Not Rashly, not Cowardly. Wisely Despair of all things; Boldly Hope: Beware of all things; yet scorn fear to cope. 66. Sir Tho. Nevil's Motto. Ne vile velis. Scorn Baseness. Let not vain, or Vile things thy Honour stain: Vile things are worth but little; Nothing vain. 67. To Sir Phil. Sidney, concerning his Arcadia. You did at Death, (witness your wife) command, That your Arcadia, through some bloudy hand, Should give a Treat, to the Impartial flame: And like a Phœnix Nest, perfume thy Name. But if the Crime be fatal, that hot Fires, Were by it kindled, in Lovers desires; Those queint Lines, by more Justice had been sent A present, to the watry Element. But let your Book be sentenc'd; ev'ry vote, Proclaims your wit, shall reach times highest Note. 68. To the most learned Gentlewoman; Mris. Jane Owen. I never heard of, nor did ever see, Those Sisters, a Fifth Father, gave to Thee. Therefore how many, and how Qualifi'd; By unacquaintance, could not be descry'd. Yet what they are, (Dear Jane!) I full well know; If't be their happiness, to be like you. 69. To his Friend. Though I hate none, I'll not be twice a Friend: My Friendship once begun, shal ne'r have End. 70. The Usurers Grammar. Take Bird, Beast, Fish, or any creeping thing; This, that, all these, acknowledge Love their King. Yet Mr. Gold, Dame Plate, a thing call'd Cash; Compar'd with Love; proves that proud Victor, Trash. 71. To one, like neither of his Parents. Why do you neither Parent represent; Since Both at your conception, gave consent? Not Fathers, Mothers Features, can you show: For Both, strove joyntly, when they begot you. 72. To two concealing their Names, at their Return from Venice. You went to Venice, to seek four-fold Gains, To fill your purses; and reward your pains. Since ye got good; your friends were wel content, That ye return'd; though to their detriment. 73. Adultery, and Fornication. The idle Fornicator, Pray, how far, Differs he from the loose Adulterer? I shall resolve this Question, if I can: As much as Comick, and Tragœdian. 74. Concerning Hercules. To C. D. No Monster could Alcides hurt; yet Love, Trampled upon him; and sate Queen above. A Lion could not; a Lass made him yeeld: Not Beasts with Four, but Two Legs, won the field. 75. A friendly Salute. I desire Phyllis, three kisses to have; At least as many as your Lips, I crave. She lends Me one; is paid; yet denies Two: Take thine, or give me mine; why this adoe? 76. A Problem to the Naturalist concerning a Kiss. Either a Kiss, to taste, belonging is; Or why most proper, by the Mouth, to Kiss? 77. To Labiemus. This is Promotion; Heaven, waites on Me; Quoth Labiemus, at the Gallow-Tree. 78. Upon Alexander. To Philip's Son, a world, gave not content: Though he Rul'd North, South, West, the Orient. Though we the world, vastly dilated finde; It was too narrow, to contain his Minde. To Philip's Son, the world prov'd much too vast; For his long Arms to clasp it in the wast. Though he was Great, by Actions; Great, by Birth: Yet this Great Man, was Lesser then the Earth. 79. To Firmicus, against Aulus. You Beleeve none; yet Firmicus, I see No Man such Sceptic, but will Beleeve, thee. What others tell, you Aulus, suck all in: But for your News, no Man would give a Pin. 80. Upon a certain Versifier. You drink, as if, none could a Poet be; Without from Ale, they learn the Mysterie. You swill, as if, the Muses lend an Hand To none; but those, whom Beer forbids, to stand. When drunk, you Rhythm, without all wit, or Fear: You may love drink; your self, an Hogs-head are. 81. Upon certain Lying Letters. I frequenly receive Lines you endite: But seldom, never, do you Gospel write. 82. Physician, heal your self. To Gilbert. I bid you, minde your self; yet might Neglect: You for your self, have singular Respect. 83. Upon a certain Usurer. In a good Mood, you lent an Hundred Pound, To Flava; now ask Use; but on what Ground? If you get Principal, 'tis an Abuse, To require more; her Body, paid you Use. Quod non habet in Ære, luat in Corpore. 84. Upon an Hypocrite. Quite through your life, you dissemble; or feign: Though Fiction is a Labour; th'other, Pain. 85. Erasmus his Encomium Moriæ. Erasmus was the First, writ Folly's Praise: Folly requited, and his Fame did raise. 86. The Anagrammatist. What a stir here's with Vowels? here, and there, The Letters fly; to light, I know not where. So by Augustus Favour; to their Coats, Thyrsis drove Sheep; and Corydon, the Goats. 87. To a certain silly Doctor. Beardless of late, and very weak, in Parts; You seem'd a Master, of the Seven Arts. But now you are a Doctor; no Beard want: But yet hang Him, that is more Ignorant. 88. Love is Naked. Nature cloathes Fields, with Grass; and Beasts, with Hair: Birds have their Plumes; Sheep, warm in Fleeces are. What ever Animal, is Born; or Bred; By Nature; or by Art, is covered: But why should Love, to Nakedness, be sold Alone? because it Naked, feels least cold. 89. Concerning the Exchequer. To Sir Will. Pits. Money collected, runs into the chinks, Of the Exchequer; so Sea, Rivers drinks. Money disperst, flies from't as fast; as though, A thousand Rivers, from the Sea should flow. And yet the Sea, is not full satisfy'd: Nor lavish streams of Crystall Rivers dry'd. 90. Upon one Perfidious. I was too credulous; that made me Heir, To Unbelief: False Hopes, taught me Despair. 91. The sin of the Silver Age. All Saturn's gilded Reign, Whores did defie: Till Jove was King; the world, woo'd Purity. 92. A Baud. Your Body is all sold; and you much scoul, Because you want a Chapman, for your Soul. Who buys a Soul! but none is so unwise, (Except Don Beelzebub) to give your Price. 93. Upon Self-Love. He's the third Person; Second, Thou; first, I: No Third, but loves the First's, Supremacy. 94. Wisdome. Who's Rich? a Wise Man; who is Poor? Unwise: Therefore if I have wit; my Bags will rise. Who's Wise? a Rich man; who's a Fool? one Poor: Either I must be Rich, or Fool, therefore. 95. The Etymologie of Venus. Venus, A Veniendo, De Nat. Deorum. Lib. 2. Tully sayes; Because to all she comes, without delayes. But in another sense, her Name I hold; 'Cause she comes oft to Markets; to be sold. 96. To a certain Fox-catcher. If Gold were as much Drunk, as Coveted; Thy Guts would make a Royal Mine; indeed! 97. To Polla. You deny Kisses unto None; none Kiss: But to their Mouths, your Cheek, reverted is. The Name of New, and Old, is not the same: Your new-found Kissing, should have a new Name. 98. A Friend, A Wife. Souls are most Dear; hence Friends, love not to part: But how comes thy Wife, so? she's thy deer Heart. 99. Anger. Because it Vertue spurns, I conjecture; The Stagyrite miscall'd it, Vertues Spur. 100. The Roman Flora. Taxes on the whole World, were by Rome laid; Yet this Great City to the Tribute paid. For what, for Hackney-hire, was given you; Was but as Tribute, to your Beauty due. 101. The Etymologie of Anger. One Angry, is perplext; so saith the Name: Anger, and An-gor, are almost the same. 102. Of Himself. Whilst light things, I touch soberly; I may Be rightly said; to study; as I Play: Whilest I write sober things, with a Light Pen; My Play, may be to Study compar'd, then. 103. Womens Titles of Honour. Let an Earl take to wife, a Countrey Girl; She is a Countess; because He, an Earl. But let a Countess marry meanly; She, Adds not one Atom, of Gentilitie. So Phœbus gilds, the Lady of the night; But scorns to vapour, in a Borrow'd Light. 104. Upon Zoilus. He that will others praise, and bears an heart, Brim-full with Love; shall himself, help to part The Stakes, with Men belov'd; &amp; prais'd: commend; Thou canst not want Requital; in the end. 105. The middle Age is unknown. Before the last Line of our Life shall trace The Grave; no Line, designs the Middle space, What to be cal'd the Middle Age, is grown, Through Custom; before Death, cannot be known. 106. To a Dyer waxing Gray. Your Beard was Black; but now 'tis turn'd to Gray: Not Art, but Nature, found out this fine way. 107. To the Courtier. Proud Rome, Superbus, to disgrace did bring; What wonder? Pride, did never love a King. Kings have not many friends; a Reason why? Because the Scepter, detests Parity. 108. Bed. What English call a Bed, the Welch call Grave: A Bed, and Tomb, Death, Sleep; Resemblance have. 109. Rider's Bibliotheca. Conceited Rider, merited great Blame; When he his Book, a Library did Name. One Book, can't make a Library; Grave on His heap of words, the Title, Lexicon. 110. Money. Doth Latine, from ?????, ??????? Greek; To derive Nummus, and Numisma, seek? Nummus denotes Money told out; Upon This Fancy, Number, will give Etymon. But I can derive't better; Money is, In all Mens Thoughts; the chief of Goddesses: This once premis'd, it fals into our Road; Nummus à Numine; As Gold, from God. 111. Upon Covetous I. S. Your Gates are Iron; you in Iron, hoard Your Gold; your House is Iron; Iron, its Lord. 112. Of Roman Flora. To the Grammarians. To Flora, Rome, did Flowers sacrifice; And her the goddess of Flowers, devise. But she, of a good Name, was Prodigal; And therefore never brought forth fruit, at all: But being wanton, in her youthful Flower; Flower, and Fruit, that Canker did devour. 113. Upon John Protus. As tepid Autumn, by severer Blasts; Trees verdent Beauty, on the low ground, casts: So Calvus had a trick, to shake his Crown; Till he shak'd fair; for ev'ry hair, fell down. 114. Upon Theodorus. When as King David was, Threescore, &amp; Ten; A florid Virgin warm'd his cold sides, then. You to do like him, who a Prophet was; Have clapt at your old back, a plump young Lass. 115. To a certain Gentlewoman. Were Fortune to you so Propitious, as Nature Profuse, in your endowments was: Had your Commands, Troy fastned to the Stake; It would have kiss'd the flames; 'cause for your sake. 116. The great Pestilence. 1603. So many Souls, this Sickness, sent to Styx; There is scarce room, for a new plague to fix. 117. Upon a perjured person, convicted, by his own Hand-writing. In vain by Oath, did you confirm a Lie; Since your Hand detects, which you can't denie. That Deeds, might exceed Words; God only gave Your Bodies Form, to challenge one mouth leave. Since God gave but one Tongue; and yet, Hands Two: What makes Hand, single; your Tongue double so? 118. Upon Cottula, the Grammaticastre. The Greek word Labyrinth, you well expound; By telling us, Labour-in-it is found. 119. The Anagram of Roma. To the Carthaginians. Hannibal took not Luck, when 'twas his course: Not well considering, the Roman Force. The way to Conquer, was known to this Man; But (though he were a subtle African) He was found Ignorant, to use his Lot. So, many strike not whilst the Iron's hot. Roma, by Mora; Little Delay, More Then fit; made Rome as Great, as once before. 120. To a certain Great Clerk. VVhere is Concoction, in a sick mans Feast? You know much, I confess; Nothing, digest. 121. Upon one Davis. To boast your self of Cockney, you think good; Lest som should say, you were of British Bloud. You refuse that, (which would a Wise Man grace) To procure descent, from an obscure Race. You, and your Countrey, Ill; yet well, Agree: You are asham'd of that; and that, of Thee. 122. Upon Aulus. Fools, count thee wise; Wise Men, A Fool i'th' Height: What art I prethee, in thine own Conceit? 123. Upon Doctor Linus. You wholly Act Formalities; but why, Do you slight Learning? Form gives Entity. If any dare, this Axiom's Truth invade; I prove it thus; Form, Linus, Doctor made. 124. Upon Thais. VVould Handsomeness were less; or Goodness more: Nothing is worser, then a Beauteous Whore. 125. Upon a great Scribler, ashamed to affix his Name. When cruel Hunger, did gag up thy Jawes; And untam'd thirst, to cry Fire, gave the cause; You like a Mad man, Idle Pamphlets made: What's your excuse? Ah! Hunger, did perswade. Curst Poverty, makes you like Tereus Sup; You beget Children; and then, eat them up. 126. Upon Mr. No-Hair. On this side, that side, before, and behinde; I search your Head: yet not one Hair can finde. Since Ev'ry Hair, hath its Plantation fled; What can you next lose Calvus? what? My Head. 127. To Claudius, and Linus. Nothing wants to make Claudius good; but Wil: Nothing but Power; to make Linus, Ill. 128. To George. If you will be in my Book, which you see, Guilty enough of lazy Poetrie; Nom. If the Praise of your Family, I take Gen. For Theme; of you I'll seldom mention make: Or if to give ye thanks, my verse should strive; To you (as you deserve) I cannot Give. My Love, and liking do to you belong; Dat. 'Cause you are not accus'd in any Song. Accu. Or noble George! shall I upon you call? Voc. Then you must sit, inferiour to all. And to spin out longer Discourse, with you; Abl. My Muse is willing: but she knows not how. 129. Every Lover, is a Souldier. VVenches to Souldiers, Aulus did compare: Men please Mars arm'd; Venus, when naked are. 130. The Military Oath. The Latines call that Oath, a Sacrament; Which to New Leaders, Times of war present. If that a Sacrament, be but just so; The Pope is right: for there are more then Two. 131. Upon Covetous and Cripled Alanus. Are Gifts to maim'd Alanus, gratis sent? He then, Briareus can represent. But if you think, a Recompence to see; His hundred Hands, prove Lame; immediately. 132. The Condition of Kings. One loves not to tell Truth; Another fears: This greatest Misery, fals to Kings shares. 133. Vis. Jus. The Anagram of Jus, the Law, is Vis, Force. The Law disgusteth Force; Force, Law; both bee In Name, good Friends; but Natures disagree. 134. Upon Marcus. VVith Wifes, with Widows, Chamber-maids, your Life Is lewdly spent; but a Fig for your Wife. Let who will Ask, your Back, scorns to say no: Any thing, but what's Lawful; you will do. 135. Desperate Debt. Men are bound to their wifes; but who dares say, He hath enough, the Total sum to pay? For though some to have paid, may make pretence; Yet they still owe, a due Benevolence. 136. Upon Culianus. A wise Man is a Cicero de Diu. lib. 2. Miracle; but now, They are all ceas'd; our Times no wise Man know. But Culian you have wit; I can't devise, If Miracles be ceas'd; you should be Wise. 137. Upon Beautiful Marc. Venus did Fire, your Tenement of Lust: In all Spectators eyes, you are Venust, 138. Upon Adrian the Fifth. Your silly Epigrams; your dull Verse, fears It should endure the sting, of acute Jeers. Though they are not Facetious; Readers smile, And laugh to see no Wit come, all the while. 139. I, Thou, He. Self-Love's the Quarry, at which all Birds flie From hence the first of Persons, must be, I. You can both flatter, and Back-bite; thus see, He stands next, Thou; and Thou, the nearest mee. 140. Ask, and you shall Receive. We read in Scripture; Ask, you shall Receive: But 'tis perform'd only to those, who Give. Give your Acquaintance, first; then They'l give you: No Chinke, no Drink; Nothing is Gratis now. Give, and it shall be Given you. 141. Husband, and Wife; Parents, Children. Husband, &amp; Wife, are both one Flesh; although, Before the sacred Union, They were Two. Father, and Son, were both one Body; yet, They can't their Horses, in one Stable set. 142. Upon Marc the Lawyer. You plead your own, in your poor Clients Cause: He Bags no Gold; for all's seiz'd by your Claws. To you the Law is certain; Not to him: He is as sure to Sink; as you to Swim. 143. To his Father. By how much Man, surpasseth Woman; I, By being Male, excel the Female Fry. 144. The Italian. The Latine like a Lord, commands his Wife; And forceth her, to lead a Prisoners Life. This Man, or none; acts Gods curse o'er again: O Woman! I will multiply thy Pain. 145. What kinde of Wife. Let Vertue, Beauty, be in Her conjoyn'd; Let her be courted; yet bear a chaste Minde. Rivals I like in Love: For I, alone; Should be a Fool, to Fancy any One. 146. To one complaining, that he could Beget no Children, like Himself. First get a Wife, in Visage, much like Thee: Then draw thy Picture, on Posteritie. 147. To Husbands concerning Conjugal Affection. When happy Adam, took Eve for his Bride; He lov'd her more, then the whole world Beside. He was the first, of Husbands; and the best: To serve Eve, in his room; now, Love is prest. 148. The Epitaph of Sir Francis Drake. Suppose Queen Maries Reign, once more return; You may rest certain; Malice, can't you Burn. You did complot, your Corps from Fire to save; When you elected such a watry Grave. 149. An Epitaph, upon a Youth, dying before Father, or Grand-Father. Death's no Logician; not Methodical: To make young Sons, before old Parents, fall. 150. The Epitaph of Maurus. Thy Soul, doth want a Body; Body, Soul: You nothing have, but Name: you, want the whole. 151. The Epitaph of Pyramus, and Thisbe. Grief did contrive your Death, Death like a Friend, Reveng'd the wrong; and brought Grief to its end. 152. Sir Tho. More at his Execution. VVhat though Head was, from Body severed? More would not let Body be cut from Head. 153. Three Languages were Crucified. The Grecian Tongue, Porter of Wit, and Art: The Regal Roman: That, God did impart. 154. Don Antonio, King of Portugal. A late Divorce, the Kingdom from you rent; Though to the Bill, you never gave consent. You may well say (now from the Throne you're hurl'd), With Christ; My Kingdom, is not of this World. 155. Alexander, and Aristotle. The greatest King; the man, to wonder, wise; Under their Notions, these two Names comprise. Great was Macedo; but the Stagyrite, As much outshin'd; as bright Day, Cypress Night. The Sages Learning did direct the King: But the Kings Greatness, could no honour bring. 156. Plato. Those Bees, which chose thy sweet Mouth for their Hive; To gather Honey from thy Works, survive. 157. Virgil's Georgicks. Those Verses, which you sent, to hold the Plough; The Readers fallow Wits, both Till, and Sow. 158. The Poet Persius. I read your Satyrs; but can't understand: An Oedipus fetch, Readers! out of hand. 159. Tacitus. Vertue, made you speake True; Nature, made Wise; Shortness, Obscure; and Gravity, Concise. 160. To Martial. You lov'd to speak of Things; but persons spare: Your Jests want Spleen; &amp; sweet as Hony are. 161. To Petrarch. Whilst Laura may be view'd; thy burnisht strains; Start boundless disputes, in the Gazors Brains; Whether fair Laura, is more due to Thee; Or the Prostration, of the Laurel-Tree. 162. Pliny Translated into English, by Doctor Holland. Pliny is Long, 'cause many things he writes; Pliny is short, much Matter, He endites. Holland is Longer; Shorter; because He, Hath Writ more full; hath shun'd Obscuritie. 163. Concerning Cicero. To Catullus. None could of falshood, Catullus convict; Nor that, which he of Tully, did Predict. 164. To the Historians of our Age. Because of old, Historians would not Lie; They were rewarded with an Eulogie. But now He all Competitors outvies; Whose Pen is fertil, with the Rampant Lies. What one Protests, others defie; how can Posterity confide, in this; that Man? No Sciolist to Blot his Species spares: Scarce any Modern Author, Truth reveres. 165. The King. His Subjects. A prince, Imprudent; Subjects will confound; As the Feet stumble, when the Brains are drown'd. 166. The Parliament. The King, is King, alone; unto him Sole, Why not Affairs, committed in the Whole? Because of Justice, this makes him the Fount; That though he Rules; He must give an Account. 167. To the Historian. You noting Story, without harm, commence. Expert in Things; which sad experience, The Learned taught. What would be long to Try; Is quickly known from Classick History. 168. Concerning Diet. To J. H. If you would shun old Age; be sure to Use, Moderate Physick: or not to abuse Your self, with Feastings. If you should like Meat, Take Physick; 'tis the way, not long to eat: But if, as upon Physick, you Meals make; Thin Diet's Healthful: and there's no Mistake. 169. The Peers of France. Not at all Equals! yet sometimes, we see Unequal Concord; equals disagree. 170. Publius Magnus. Cato Major. Fabius Maximus. The greatest was less, then the Great; yet still, Made the Greater, under wing keep his Bill. Now you have read the Riddle, Answer Me; Which was the very Greatest, of the Three? 171. To T. S. My Wit, and judgment, serve not to rehearse, Thy rare Endowments, in a polisht verse. Your Judgment, Wit; over all Arts prevail: Unless both Wit, and Judgment, in Me fail. But though my Wit, and Judgment, little be: Yet I have Judg'd the Truth; concerning Thee. 172. Of Himself. No wonder that my Epigrams, are Lead: I never bite my Nails, nor scratch my Head. 173. The five Senses. Do the five servant-Senses, more assist Us, in our Wils, and Pleasure; or resist? 174. Seeing. To pleasing Objects, Sight, conveys the Minde; And as her Vassal, doth it strongly binde. 175. Hearing. Sweet Sounds, make in our Ears, but little stay; They come like Air; like Air, they fly away. 176. Smelling. The Nose is plac'd betwixt the Mouth &amp; Eyes: In Bodies; Spirits; doth Sent exercise. 177. Tasting. That you may disgust nothing, you should Eat: Let Hunger, give the Hogoo, to your Meat. 178. Feeling. A touch may Tickle; or give bare Delight: The first, is young; the last, is old Mens Right. 179. The Objects of the Senses. The things I see, Hear, Smell, Taste, Touch; pretence, Make to affect; but do infect, my Sense. 180. Touch and Taste. Some are devoid of Smell; some Deaf, we finde: And 'tis no Rarity, to see men Blinde. But with want of Taste, Touch; the Fates ne'r strike: By Taste I live; by Touch, beget my Like. 181. An Epigram. A Satyr. An Epigram may aptly stiled be, The long-ledg'd Satyrs, brief Epitomie. A Satyr bears equal Respect; and is An Epigram, with a Periphrasis. Satyrs, without their Stings; are hiss'd by all: So Epigrams, if not Satyrical. 182. Upon one Dumb. He moves his Lips, yet speak I can't him hear: Fetch Apollonius, for Interpreter. 183. The Blinde, and Deaf. The one, his Sight; the other, Hearing prise: One sees with Ears; the other hears with Eyes. 184. Dentes, the Teeth; Lingua, the Tongue. Dens, quasi Edens; 'cause it helps to Eat: Lingua, quod Lingit; 'cause it licks the Meat. Thus to derive these words, Grammarians please; From special duties; distinct Offices. 185. The Phœnix, and the Viper. The Melancholy Phœnix when she dies; Brings forth a Daughter in her Obsequies. The fatal Viper, when she brings forth young, Dies gnawn, run through; with poysonous Teeth, and Tongue. 186. The Silk-worm. I perish by my Art; dig mine own Grave: I spin my Thread of Life; my Death, I weave. 187. The Right Hand. If Give, Receive, I still use my Right Hand; My Right Hand Acts; my Left, shan't understand. 188. The Left Hand. The Left Hand had its Name; because one Day, All Right Hands wrought, whilst Left, left Work, for Play. 189. Sunday. In the first day, there was no Sun at all: Then what makes people Sunday, it to call? 190. Terra di Lavoro. Of old, Campania, was a pleasant Land: Why now, doth Labour old demerits brand? 191. Cloathes. The Modes now in Request, were once thrown by: Old Fashions revive, for their Novelty. 192. Wine. Over a Glass of Wine, who can be Sad? 'Tis that unchains my Soul; makes my Heart glad. 193. A Sheep. Flesh, Skin, Lambs, Dung, Dice, Lute-strings, Milk, and Wooll: The harmless Sheep, affords us to the full. 194. The Dunging of Arable Land. Dung is not useless, though base Excrement: For it helps forward, my best nutriment. 195. Harmony. Discords make sweetest Musick: By this Fate, Husband, and Wife, do Children Procreate. 196. A Parret. If to invert the Name, you'l leave give mee; Then Parret turn'd a Prater you shall see. 197. Ink, and Paper. Ink's black Patch, to affect the Readers sight; Useth to Borrow, from the Paper, white. 198. A Comedie. What we Act secretly, comes to the Stage: Fiction, hits True, the Vices of our Age. 199. A man in a Cloke. Though I trample the Earth; my vaulting Cloke, Scorns Goodwife Tellus, durty cheeks to stroke. A Scholar in a Gown. Though my Gown kiss the ground, Thoughts come not near. They make a Foot-stool of old Saturn's Sphear. 200. A Satyr. Vice begot Satyrs; Vice begot the Law: The end of both, is to keep Men in awe. 201. An Eunuch. Though I want what some have; yet brag I can, Ther's a false-witness left, to prove Me, Man. 202. The Hour-glass. The cheating Hour-glass, at Time right may guess; Because its Hole is bigger, &amp; Sand, less. 203. The Merchant. I can't call him Rich, or Poor; whose Estate, Upon deluding Waters, fluctuate. 204. Lasciviousness. That in the Night, deform'd seem Fair; you must Not blame the Dark; but fault your stone-blind Lust. 205. Donna. None keep their Wifes more under; yet none less Forget, then He; to call them Mistresses. 206. A Souldier. Though armed Mars, is cruel without bounds; Yet naked Venus, gives Thee deeper wounds. 207. What an Army usually is. A multitude, disloyal, rude, Hair-brain'd; And perhaps Hands, with guiltless Bloudshed stain'd. 208. The Tears of Lovers. As from the wood, Sap is expell'd by fire: So Tears, are from the Head, by not Desire. 209. The Stars. Love you Imparity? Beleeve me; God, When He created Stars; created Odd. 210. Venice. As Waters make the Sea; as Stars, the Sky: So Riches, the Venetian Seignory. 211. The Lute. Can there be many strings; and yet no Jars? And are not men asham'd of dismal wars? 212. The Fowler. What must the Fire, be on your errand sent? Your will's observ'd, by Ev'ry Element. 213. The Eccho. Ask Art to paint a voice; you it confound: The Eccho can Limn voice; on hollow ground. 214. A Looking-Glass. Apelles could not depaint Motion; you Excell his colours: To give you, your Due. 215. The Eccho and the Looking-Glasse. No Sign of Life, but Sound; to Eccho grant: Mirrors would Live; did they not voices want. 216. Musick. The Muses, Name to Musick, do impart; But scorn to Grace so much another Art. 217. Albion. To the King. The Saxons had their Heptarchie. A while, Nine large Partitions did dissect this Isle. But Albion, Olbion, you have made to be; Happy in her Dear Sisters, Unitie. THE THIRD BOOK. 1. To the Lady Mary Nevill. Though I delight to praise you; greatest spight, Cannot convict Me, for a Parasite. Madam, all sorts commend; yet you express, By humble Carriage; that none wish it less. Applause you seek not, though desert soars high: Of all your Praise, this is the Summary. 2. To the same Lady. You were a Burden, to your Mothers womb: Now her great Weight of Glory, are become. 3. To the Reader. I dread the Candid, may dislike my Book. I fear that Fools, may giv't a scornful Look. 4. The Off-spring of the Virgin-Queen Elizabeth. 1602. England, and Scotland's, blessed Unity; The Issue was, of your Virginity. She is more glorious, who Unites two States, Then She, who like the Vulgar Generates. So you, great Queen! A Virgin pleas'd to die: And happy Mother, to Posteritie. 5. To the Hollander, 1602. That Minerva did help you; must be said, Whilst England's Pallas, did your Hogans aid. Thus were you happy; but now Fate throws down, Your haughty Actings, with a churlish Frown. Of late Death, Death; Ulysses did become: And stole your Pallas, and Palladium. 6. To King James. Now are the Golden Daies; long since foretold: When one Kings head, Brute's double Crown, should hold. Our Islands; thought the By-blow, of the World: By Peace, have now, their golden Tresses, Curl'd. So that who hate stern Mars; must Eccho this; That the cold Owen Tewder, the Grand-father of Henry the 7, came out of North Wales: King James, out of Scotland; the North part of Great Britain. North, is Donour of their Bliss. 7. To the Prince. O you Great Britain's Hope! Lord of a Part, Both of a King, and Queens, most Royal Heart. Nobilities Exemplar; although Few, Can write after so rare a Copy, true. But though select devoirs, you are above; Your Subjects crave a pardon, with their Love. Did great James this, ex Traduce, infuse? Or Fair Annes Milk? I can't tell which to choose. 8. Basilicon doron. To the King. No need to give the Author, or Book, Praise: For here's Reciprocation, of the Bayse. 9. To the Lady Mary Nevill. The glass, attests you fair; modest, cries Fame: Your Glass speaks true; and Report doth the same. Though Fame be a swift evil; yet it spares Your Ladiship: not to vent slanders, dares. 10. Of Cæcilia, Daughter to that Lady. No Limner can, Qualities shadow forth: And yet you have, a Picture, of your worth. 11. To the Candid Reader. What I make Good, you Praise; my worst wit, may Pass for indifferent: Thus you please to say. 12. To the Envious Reader. If I make any Bad; none can be Worse: If tolerable; them, you likewise Curse. Hercules his two waies. Most men can err in four waies; some, in three: Alcides lost his way in two; we see. 13. Concerning Vertue. Vertue, slights Praise; yet Praise, resolves to be, Constant Retainer, to her Familie. Glory, waits upon Merit; as the shade, Upon that Body; which it, perchance made. Vertue is real; Honour is not; thus, Substance are we: not the shade, waits on Us. 14. Lifes Dial. My Daies verge upon West; lost are the Best: Nor shall I see again, the vanisht East. I had my Birth last night; Live, just this Day: Finde me to Morrow, in the Grave; you may. 15. Of God. Thy Omnipresence, Euclid's Rules confutes: Plato's Scholar; knew not, thy Attributes. 16. The Atheist. That there's no God; the Psalmists Fool avers: But the most simple, to Beleeve it fears. If no, Fool denies God; what creature's He, Call'd Atheist? One that wish, no God should be. 17. Charity. No Wise is Faithful, but Love makes her so: Where Faith resideth; Charity dwels too. 18. Dives, and Lazarus. Dives is put i'th' Gospel, without Name: But Poor, were then call'd Lazers; still, the same. 19. Encrease, and multiply. Poor Man created was at first, alone: But shortly after, Woman added one. When Adam married Eve; then, as before, The World was Rul'd by One; and not one more. After Creation, Man did multiply: God conjoyn'd Eve: so came posterity. 20. Union. From Hell sprung Discord; Union, is Divine: God is but One. Hells Quotient, none assign. 21. The three Tempters. The World, and Flesh, will flatter; Devil, Lie: They Oratory use; He Sophistry. 22. The Spirit and the Flesh. What the Spirit command, the Flesh controul: Thus Grace, and Sin, divide my wretched Soul. Would Flesh, and Spirit, but conclude a Peace; Revenge, Jars, Wars; quite through the world should cease. 23. A man was a God to another: Is now a Wolf. Man, like a God his Brother did defend: Man, like a Wolf, his Brother now will rend. Christ, to he God, to Man, came from on high: But Adam practis'd, Wolfish cruelty. 24. Gods Word. Præscience belongs to God; to Man, mistakes: Vain Man talks much, God only one Word makes. 25. The Narrow way. To the broad Streets of Heaven, Scripture hath Commanded Us, to choose the narrow Path. The straight way, leads to Heavens Palaces: Or Broad way, puts ye, in Hells Little-ease. 26. St. John the Baptist. As the Suns approach, is foretold by Light: John before Christ, saluted mortals Sight. 27. Of Autumn. Autumn shakes off the Leaves, and brings Fruit too: I wish we could, like gelid Autumn doe. 28. The Miseries of Life. All wish to Live, though they be sickly, poor; Small Griefs, will not suffice; they wish for more. The forlorn Irus, desires not, to Die; That is; is loath to part with Miserie. 29. Of Nature, and Grace. Nature dispelleth Darkness, like the Moon: But Grace, is like the Sun; at exact Noon. 30. A Catechism. Twelve Articles of Faith, you must believe; That you may not, the Holy Spirit Grieve. If you desire, effectually to Pray; Christ's seven Supplications; use, you may. Duties incumbent on all sorts of Men: Have their Sum total, in the Number Ten. 31. The Rich Man. Why go few Rich to Heaven? why? because, They grieve for Breaking Sums; but not God's Laws. 32. O Treacherous Hope! Rather fallacious World; for Hope will stay, Till extream Ruine, sign our fatal Day. 33. Upon our Redeemer. As one Mans sin, did Death on all entail: So one Mans Death, our souls from Hell did Bail. The falsest Calumnies were meekly born: Adam offended; Christ was made a scorn. 34. The Holy Ghost. To white Dove-houses, Pigeons take their flights: In candid Hearts, God's Spirit, much delights. 35. Valour. The Wise Man knows, the Just will render right: He which joyns Courage, is the Man of might. 36. Of the King. Laws, without King, in a Parallel run, With duskish light, discarded by the Sun. King without Laws, is Phœbus in the Night; What though there be a Sun? we see no Light. The People chose their King; they both made Laws. Hence Laws; hence Lords; the Royal Scepter awes. 37. The Welsh. Wales is not sole Heir, to the British Name: For England, Scotland; answer to the same. 38. The English-Scot. These Nations differ in their Customs; how Came they espoused to an Union, now? The Law, Predominant, in ev'ry Land; (The Kingdom's safety) joyn'd them, hand in hand. 39. Roses were united by Henry: Kingdoms by James. To the King. The superb Red, and White Rose; might Revie Fraternal wounds; with Cadmus Progenie. Like Leda's Twins; they disdain'd to appear Consuls of the same convex Hemisphere. But as the Argent Day, routs Sable Night; Then the Earth's shadow captivates the Light: York should no longer, an Occasion have; Then till Lancastrian Prowess, could Enslave. Until the Isle of Man, (whence British bee, Ambitious to derive their Pedigree;) Until this high-priz'd Isle, (which vaunts a Name, By Tacitus, put in the Rolls of Fame;) So happy was, as to bring Thewder forth: A ???? ???; both by Name, and worth. This Gift of God, to him was neer Allied; Who in a Gordian Knot, two houses tied. Whose Red-rose Birth, (Thanks Hymen) did unite The blister'd Discord, of the Red, and White. But lest disgust should think Divorce to sue: Henry, betrothed Roses; Kingdoms, you, 40. John Napiers Revelation. Ninety, and two years hence, the World shall end: Is it at your disposal, my Good Friend? But why would you, no shorter Time devise? What, to be call'd a Liar? you are Wise. God, and Man. God could not suffer Death; and Man could not, Over the Crave, a Victory have got: But Christ could Die, and Vanquish; because, He, Had God-head; joyned to Humanity. 42. Death. Death, sought by Good; shun'd by such as offend: Ends Evils; or brings those which have no End. 43. God. God is Immense; because nothing can fly, Commensuration, by Omnisciency. Numbers Perfection, is by Him, outgone: The Dual, begins Number; God's but One. 44. A Miracle. The Vulgar admire Miracles; to Mee, Nothing is Marveilous; O God! but Thee. 45. Adam's Disobedience. Galen, Justinian, Aquinas, and all: Might have been spar'd, but that for Adam's Fall. 46. To Adam. The Devil, to deceive Thee, lent Eve skill: She gave Good Morrow; but did mean to kill. 47. To the Divine. The Countrey Horologe, first claps his wings; Before he News, of grateful Day-light brings: Thou that wouldst have, thy Preaching take effect; What thy own Life is, first of all; reflect. 48. The Tempter. As nibling Mice, use to deal with old Chests: The Devil finds, or makes waies; into Brests. 49. Mortification. Unless Sin Dies, no hope of Life; then try In time, to make it facile, for to Die. 50. To Day. This instant time, Men yesterday did call, To Morrow: what strange Name will it befal, To Morrow? the Name of Yesterday, then Shall be put on it; by all kinde of Men. Cras is neer, yet never comes: I shall say Upon these Thoughts; To Morrow, is to Day. 51. Against thee only have I sinned. A subject sins, against God; Law, and King: None, but a Prince; can such an excuse bring. 52. Prayer. As Christ came in, although the doors were shut: So into Heaven; Fervent Prayers get. 53. Upon Mary Magdalen. What faults her eyes were guilty of, in years Of wantonness; she blots out, with her tears. A faculty to weep, resides in eyes: For by their Treachery; most sins surprize. 54. Concerning Hope and Fear. Riches, and Fears, are huge Concomitants; Hope a Companion, unto him that wants: Yet Hope is thought, a comfortable thing; But fear darts through the Soul a forked sting. Hope belongs to the Poor; to wealthy, Fears: You may take Hope; I fancy, Golden Cares. 55. Methusalem is dead. Not to have Liv'd, but to Live; Life, implies! If Man lives many years; at last He Dies. 56. Of Lawes, and Justice. Men the Laws Path, more then Astræas track: Yet Justice they find quick; and the Law, slack. 57. Intemperance. The Universal wish, is to Live long: Yet Luxury, may freely, lead us wrong. We destroy, what we wish for; Life must be, A debtor to Physicians; not to Thee. 58. To Ponticus. 'Tis hard to become Rich; since you are Poor. If you were Rich, 'twere nothing, to get more. 59. The Pharisees. Their Life was foul, Speech fair; our Age likewise; To cloud Hypocrisie; are grown precise. But if you credit, what Grammarians tell; Faith comes from Fio; delights to do well. 60. Liberty. 'Tis Happiness, what I wish, to acquire; Why then do Men, destructive things desire? Goodness, is the grand Freedome; only they Live to content, whom Vertue teach the way. 61. What Countrey Christ was of. Conceiv'd A Nazaret, Born, Bethlemite: But to Two Countrys; Nature, pretends Right. 62. Christ's Crucifixion. Christ was a Life, to such sad Souls, as knew The Second Death, was wages, to them due; To sick, a Cure; a Way, to them at Loss; Death, unto Death; a Torment, to the Cross. 63. Christ's Cross. The Cross bare Christ; Christ the Cross up did take: Thus Mercy mov'd Him; for distress'd Mans sake, 64. Upon Religion. In Pious Hearts, a Tree must Grafted be; Whose Fruit, is Honour; whose Root, Industrie. That Fear made Gods, I readily assent; For godly Fear, is Graces Instrument. Although the Root of Piety, speaks Gall; Yet She is Hony, uppermost of all. Fear is the Fount; the River which thence springs, Is Love: whose ev'ry Drop, much sweetness brings. 65. Upon the Prodigal, and Covetous. The Miser, not one Farthing gives, till Death: Spend-thrift hath nothing to give; more then Breath. 66. Man, and Wife. Let Husbands Love their Wifes; Wifes, recompence Their Husbands Love; with strict Obedience. As Husband is the Head; let the wife be Heart, to her Head; in meer humanity. 67. Study. Some lose their wits, by Study; but ne'r they Grow mad; who study Vertue, Night, and Day. 68. Memento Mori. Think on Death. The Hour of Death is dubious; and yet A certain Time, by Destiny is set. No Man is far remote from West; from East: Yet when we think on them, 'tis but in Jest. 69. The Virgin Mary. God's Spouse, her Fathers Mother might be styl'd A Daughter, to her own Cœlestial Child. She was a Virgin, and yet Married: She, A Mother was; yet kept Virginitie. That which is Rare, is not alwaies Dear. A Paradox. Vice is a Disease, Epidemical; Yet 'tis held Dear: Its price will never fall. Though seldom humane Eyes, Vertue behold: Yet for all that, at easie Rates 'tis sold. 71. A Beast. On Future things, not on those which are past; Is it the fashion, Hopes Anchor to cast. Things Vanishing, Hope Dies; or, hopes appear; But where is the enjoyment? that's not near. Times Past, the Future; both do Tyrannize: The Beast takes what is present; He is wise. 72. Reason. Nature is Mother; Reason, Queen of things: Nature begets; Reason, to Order brings. 73. Nature. Reason, is Natures Childe; and therefore saies: If you'l be Happy; follow Natures waies. 74. I must take leave to talk my Minde. Alas poor Creature! all your Freedom's gone; For you no more, may rave against the Throne. But Liberty of Tongue, will never cease; If you can obtain Leave, to hold your Peace. 75. To Marcus. A Problem. What if you take a Bad, or honest Course? For Bad, by Law are punish't; Good, by Force. 76. Upon Antiquarians, and Novators. 'Tis foolish Envy, to pass all things by; But what are mouldy, with Antiquity. 'Tis Envious Folly, all things to explode; But what are adorn'd, with the newest Mode. 77. What Death is to a Christian. Through Death, at Life eternal, we arrive: 'Tis not an End, but Beginning to Live. 78. To Christ. Lord! thou Hopes Anchor art; which never fails; A Sea of Love; the Ship, where our Faith sails. Thou art Salt to the Earth; Sun, to the Sky: The Ransom, paid for Souls captivity. Destruction was destroy'd; Death by thee slain: Who thought, Death could have suffer'd Deadly Pain? 79. Self-Love. They who see others Faults; and not their own: For others, Wise; for themselves, Fools are grown. 80. The Lifes of Saints. Not to read Lifes of Saints, but such to Live; Is that which in the end will Profit give. To turn Leaves over, no Advantage brings: Strive not to Read, but Relish, Holy things. 81. A man's Countrey. A good Man alwaies is at Home; a wise, Under the fear of Banishment ne'r lies. A valiant Son of Mars, where e'r he be: Converts that Place, into his own Countrey. Where we can't Thrive; we there, as exiles dwell: My Countrey is, where ever I am well. A Good Mans Countrey, from him can't be rent. The wicked alwaies, are in Banishment. 82. Against the Atheist. Time past cannot Avail; Future, can't Ope To such a Reprobate; the door of Hope. Thy choyce desires, only on that reflect; Which for this moment; doth the Sence affect. 83. Upon Hereticks. From Ennius dunghil, Virgil scrapt up Gold: Hereticks Dung; from Truths most precious Mold. 84. The effect of Praise. Good Men, are made Better; Bad, worse by Praise: Crafty, More sly; 'twill the Fools folly, raise. 85. Not too Fast. A good Man is not quickly built; take heed, Though in plain way; you make not too much speed: Prudent Advice those slight, which are in hast: First thy self Collect; then correct at last. 86. The Envious, and the Fool. The one wants Honesty, the other wit: One cannot see; the other, thinks not fit. 87. ?????. Reason. 'Tis Reason which God speaks; and which we Pray. Thus God, and Man; both, Rationally say. 88. Opinion. None will Beleeve; as Friendship; so Men Try Their Reputations; by Utility. 89. Art. God did in Natures Bosom, place the Arts: That Man might have a Touch-stone for his Parts. 90. Adam's Apologie. For sin's first Author, Men have flings at Mee: Did not Eve pull the Apple, from the Tree? 91. The Serpents Answer. This Allegation prove you never can: To Tempt you, (but your self) there was no Man. 92. Alwaies the same. God alwaies was, is, shall be thought but One: Why came not Faith down to the world, alone? One Faith, as well as Day, gives Light a Birth: There's but one Sun, in Heaven; God, on Earth. 93. Cordial Prayer. Since your Breast, is the Church; let it be pure: The Holy Ghost, for Minister procure. And because God, for uprightness will look; Make a clean Heart, thy devout Prayer-book. 94. The five Wounds. Christ's Wounds, we soveragn Emplaisters finde: They heal the Ulcers, of a troubled Minde. 95. Friendship delineated. When Sol puts on his splendid Robes of State; Our Bodies Shadow turns Associate. When Solar Beams, yeeld to a churlish sky; Our Shadows vanish, with Celerity. Whilst Fortune smiles upon ye, never fear The want of Friends; thou shalt have some to spare. When the Stern Fates, turn to storms, serene Day; Friends will, as much as shadows, Post away. 96. Vertue. Not Talk, but Actions, Vertues Pearls comprise: Faith, Hope, and Love; are Real Entities. 97. Rachel. What weep, because Children are from you torn? Had you not Grief enough, when they were Born? 98. Solomon. So many wise Men, as the world can cull; So many things are in it wonderfull. Solomon died; before Greece, seven nurst: He was not the eighth Wise-man; but the first. 99. Hope. I can't prevent, what must fall to my share: I'l neither Hope for Good; nor Evils fear: Yet Hope will do me all the Good she can: Expectancy drawes out, my Lifes short Span. 100. Humane Ignorance. I scarcely know what Life is; how should I Tell, what 'tis to be Born; and what to Die? 101. Christ is the Way. Canst not thou the streight way to Heaven, see? Behold! the Way it self, comes down to thee. 102. Of Fame. Do well; and crouch not to Plebeian Fame: 'Tis but an empty Adjunct to thy Name. 103. Faith. Amongst Opinions, Faith had most Respect; From the Tongue-tyed, Pythagorean Sect. For whatsoever the old Samian knew; An ipse dixit, did confirm it true. 104. Indifferency. Be Death far off, be the fatal stroke nigh: 'Tis culpable to wish; or fear, to Die. 105. The freshest Date. If I mistake not, I may boldly say; That the first Age, was the Worlds New-years Day. Then studious Reader, let me crave of you; Are the Times we now live in; Old, or New? 106. The Will. Would you be Good? Vertue, you may acquire: He will inable; who made you desire. 107. To the Sun. Twice eighty times, Astronomies express, Sol bigger then the Earth; yet seems much less. If you a Pygmie, Sol! appear to Me, A little Worm; how small seem I, to Thee! 108. Probity. Good Men, are oft out-witted; and what then; Since they excel in Vertue, wiser Men? 109. A Man. The chief Ingredient to Mans heart, is Care; Foul, noysom Carkasses; our Bodies are: Birth, is but sickness; and that Life we have, Frequently found a passage to the Grave. 110. Concerning Loquacity. To the Preacher. So many Sermons your bad Life denote: For what need words, if Men your Deeds, might quote? 111. Death is both contrary, and according to Nature. If you would follow Nature, cruel Death! You should snatch Parents, before Childrens Breath. To Natures Dictates, we obsequious be: For Life, and Death; are both by her Decree. 112. Eloquence. Great Talkers are not alwaies Eloquent; A few neat Fancies, Auditors content. Nor is that field thought Fruitful; whence proceeds, A thousand Cart-loads full, of stinking weeds. 113. God. As Clouds permit not, Heaven to descrie; So none see God, 'cause Mists on their mindes lie. None have seen God; but few, did ever hear: Hence Faith comes by Hearing. Faith is scarce; but Love by Sight. Love is much more Rare. 114. To Ponticus. You would think Me unkinde, should I deny, To tell you how many years old, am I: Since my Age is, this Moment; I say None; For the years I have Liv'd, away are flown. 115. Love and Friendship. To Charles. What space betwixt Nature, and Habits, lie; So far is Love, distant from Amitie. 116. Princes. Hugely Religious, ye seem to be; And very Zelots, as to Pietie: 'Tis not Love of Religion, makes ye thus; But thirst of honour, Sanctimonious. 117. O the wickedness of our Times! Let the worst Vices happen to be nam'd; Innocent Time, is certain to be Blam'd. Yet we can't prove him guilty of such Crimes: Men are not undone by; but in the Times. 118. Philosophy. The World loves to know much; but few things, will Beleeve: hence comes great Faith, &amp; little skil. 119. Evils are innumerable. VVe Die, a thousand waies; are Born but One: Thousand Diseases push at Health, alone. 120. Upon Controversies. Will Divines everlastingly contend? Would they were pleas'd, a Judge, the strife might End. Concerning who should be the Judge, they Brawl; I wish sincerely, that dispute were all. Might I contemplate once within my Life! As great a strife of Love; as Love of Strife. 121. Christ upon the Cross. Betwixt two Thiefs, Christ fill'd the empty space: Now Vertue had, if ever, Middle Place. 122. The Daughter of Time. Truth lies along Time hid; yet comes to Light: Greece cals her ??????; 'cause she flies sight. 123. Law and Physick. If Men would Live, as Prudent Nature teach; They should climb quickly, out of Galen's reach: If Men were wise, they would not so long Jar; Till they are witnest Fools, by the whole Bar: But Bartolus, should then despair to please; And Mice might comment, on Hippocrates. 124. Husband and Wife. VVhen Angry, a whole House can't us contain; A Bed can hold; when we are friends again. 125. The shortest Day. Our Lifes last day, doth the most short, appear; Quite through that Day, the end is very near. 126. Vertues Complaint. Love hath few servants; who will Vertue own? Credit, and honour; extreme dear are grown. Riches are sold; Mony, made Merchandize: Vertue, for her Rewards; must pay Excise. 127. The Rigid Father. The Avaritious Father, is most Free: The more he scrapes, the more He leaves to thee. 128. A Prayer to God in time of Sickness. Natures great Parent! when as thou shalt please, My Soul from flesh, Her Prison, to release; Let Grace, with thy afflicting Hand comply: When I want strength to Live; give will to Die. 129. To the Pleader. Where Judges Favour not; they invent flaws: 'Tis not your Eloquence, secures a Cause. Throw Reports by; and Study Day, and Night: What to turn Lawyer? No; but Favourite. 130. Upon Brunonius. Our Ancestors ordained Fasting-daies; That Flesh might obey Spirit; that God Praise: Your Table turns Fasts, into Feasts, We see; That Spirit might serve Flesh; and Flesh, serve Thee. 131. Time. Time sweeps all things away; as well as brings: As all things have their Times; Time hath, all Things. 132. Upon Miracles. Is Gods Hand shortned, that Miracles cease? Is it not rather caus'd by Faith's decrease? 133. To Irus. You would Live ever; ever you can't Live: Yet you can wish you ever might survive. But since you are so Poor; I wonder, still: Though you may wish to Live; that Live, you will. 134. Science. In my Judgment, Happy are they alone, Who all things know: or they, who know not one. 135. Christ. Aurora expels Night: and Day, begins: Christ was Death's Ruine; a Fount to purge sins. 136. Who art Thou? My eyes fail, when they should themselves behold; My minde, in Mental Scrutinies, is cold. If noblest Parts pass unknown; I may cry, To the next Comer; Sir! Pray, who am I? 137. The Kingdome of Heaven. Though Heaven's large; Most have an Hellish Doom: Perhaps the straight way gives no Elbow-room. 138. Pain, and Pleasure. Present Grief stabs; Future holds in suspence, The fearful Soul; yet delights, when gone hence. Dolorous Pleasures, please; when Smart is past: 'Tis Sad; if Pleasure fades, whilst Sorrows last. 139. St. Peter. Caiphas was last High-Priest, in that Place, where Jehovah's Temple, Jury did Revere. Kephas was first High-Priest, whose Chair did rest; Where the Emperial Eagle, built her nest. 140. Sleep. By Metaphors of Death, we sleep express: The more Men sleep, 'tis sure, they Live the less. 141. Rome. The World was scarce of Age, when Envious Cain, His Brother Abel, in the Field had slain. Princely Rome, was no sooner Edified; But Remus Bloud, her walls in Crimson Dyed. Cain's cruel Murder, did the World pollute: Rome, the worlds Mistress; his steps prosecute. 142. Mans Perfection. 'Tis the Perfection of every thing, To return to that, whence it first did spring. Frail flesh, will my accomplishment adjourn; Till I to Earth, and Heaven shall return. 143. Lord encrease our Faith, Luk. 17. Our Age shan't need, after this form to Pray; We rather, Lord diminish, Faith, may say. As numerous as Men, Religions are: Though Faiths be many, Faithfulness is rare. Lord decrease our Faiths. 144. Upon a Covetous Person. Hercules travel'd, till the furthest West, Stopt his Career; &amp; gave his wandrings rest. The Covetous go further; their desire, Is alwaies Errant; and can never Tire. 145. Good transcends. No Genus, no bounds, Good, can comprehend: No Mundane Creatures, do to Goodness tend. 146. Omnia Vanitas. All is Vanity. VVhat showers of Tears! had Heraclitus seen, Our times: Democritus had burst his spleen. But one Democritus cannot suffice, To Laugh at such mad Tricks, as men devise. And Heraclitus eyes approach not nigh; Due Lamentations, for our Misery. 147. Upon the Voluptuous. I often hear young men complain, how short The pleasures are, of the Venereal sport. I often hear Gray-headed Sirs, thus cry; O what a curse, is vital Brevity! Lifes Pleasure, Pleasures Life, are short: who prize Them both at little, may be termed wise. 148. Works. Vertuous, and Vitious Persons, when they Die; Carry their Works with them, for company. 149. The beginning of Wisdome. None desire Heaven, but those who fear Hell: Dread of the worst, makes prudent Men, Hope well. 150. Upon one delighting in Tautologies. How you torment good Scholars, I let pass; And how your Tales, run quite beyond the Glass. When you have kil'd your Hearers, in this sort; You exclaim; But I see the Time is short. Return to Oxford, and Distinctions learn; Till you long Prating, from short Time discern. 151. Upon the same. Tully's Orations, cannot be too long: Who thy short Sermons fault, their Judgment wrong. 152. Upon those who imagine many Gods. O foolish People, have ye lost your wits? Over one World; one God, as Ruler sits. 153. Concerning Ingenuity and Study. Neglect of Study, renders wit obtuse; So Swords will rust, by reason of disuse. Study, wits Ladder; wits downfal, hath bin: As Grind-stones sharpen knives; they wear them Thin. 154. Know your Self. None understand themselves: yet a young Man, The years of Child-hood, well remember can: And an old Father, troubles much his Tongue; To relate what he did, when He was young. 155. Art is long, and Life is short. Life is too short, to make us truly wise: Death creeps behinde, and unawares surprise. 156. To old Moranus. As you have many things, for to acquire; So to Unlearn: if goodness you desire. But how should you do either, since you lie; Under old Ages Incapacity? 157. To D. T. 'Cause you have happy been, you must needs lie Under a double weight, of Misery. Happy is he who hath had heretofore, Adversity; for the Storm is blown o'r. 158. Every one as they like. The Laick seeks not Christ; but his own Gains: Not to get Christ, but Tythes; Parsons take Pains. 159. Upon Brunonius. That Plagues are Gods sharp Arrows, you confess; Whence comes then Bruno; your great Healthfulness? The Reason's ready: for a Plague like you; Your Countrey disclaims, that she ever knew. 160. Reflect upon your End. Rather fore-see thy end; reflect on Birth: Look up to Heaven; and look down on Earth. 161. Sense, Reason, Faith, Charity, God. Sense without Reason, is worth little; and Reason's unruly; unless Faith command. What is Faith, without Love? Love cannot bee, Advantage; till, my God! it fix on Thee. 162. Of Prudence. Our Actions are jejune; unless address Be made to Prudence; Vertues School-mistress: She teaches what to choose; what to eschue, In Life: as in Art, Logick tels what's true. 163. To my Parents. Dear Father, I am part of you; and part Of you, dear Mother; cast Lots for my Heart. You two, yet but one flesh; my Body make: What dangers fear I; be they for your sake? 164. Prudence, and Fortitude. Prudence foresees Evils; valour can bear: One seeks Prevention; the other slights Fear. 165. In the sweat of thy Face. He who commands Labour, for daily Bread; Will deny Manna, to the drowzie Head. 166. Of Faith, and Charity. Before there be a Tree, who Fruit expect? Above all Vertues, we must Faith respect. Love joyn'd to Faith, do Life beget: the Poor, Can't live by Hope; but they must labour more. Faith is the Chieftain; but Love is the King: As well as Faith; we must Affections bring. 167. If thy right Eye offend thee, &amp;c. If as oft as they Sin, Men were inclin'd, To pluck out eyes; the World would be stark blinde. 168. Christian Adverbs. Not Adjectives; Adverbs, please the most High: When we do good; we must do't Cordially. 169. The shortness of Life. To unborn Infants, all things equall are: For what is past, grave Seniors seldom care, If past, and future Times, I should substract: What a small number; Present hours exact! 170. Lex Talionis. To Aulus. You peruse not, the Ancient History: Expect like Justice; from Posterity. 171. Time. Time devours Things; His Sithe our Legs will hit. We have our pastimes: Time and we are Quit. 172. Abundance of Caution, hurts not. Be not afraid, yet look, before you leap: Be not rash; count no opportune Time, cheap. To fearful Nature, Prudence lends a Shield: None dangers dread, who their Ambush beheld. 173. Sir, minde the matter in hand. VVhat though Philosophers on the Face fly? One word will vanquish them; say, I deny. 174. Justification. Doth God us Justifie, by Works, or Faith? By both together; holy Scripture saith. 175. The Day of Judgment. If all, this Day; their large Accounts must clear; St Barnabie, will be too short, I fear. 176. To Marianus. Good Men for Vertues sake, do detest Vice: But now a Daies, there's few that are so Nice. Goodness is so contemned, in our Time; That to be Good, is thought an heinous Crime. 177. Mary Magdalens Sorrow. One Mountain here, two well-fed Springs can show: From whence, two Rivers of Salt water flow. 178. Upon the Soul. The Soul is not infus'd; for if it were, It would be mortal; as our Bodies are. 179. To Marcus. VVhen to Pray, you at any Time shall please; You institute your Bed, Chappel of ease. You might well think, Heaven would exclude thence, Prayers; presented with irreverence. Till wandring thoughts, rude gestures, you forbear: God Audience gives; but is not pleas'd to Hear, 180. Hell. Who can reduce Cloth dyed Black to White? What Damned Soul, enjoy'd again the Light? 181. To his poor Friend. Your bad Estate, I wish worse for your sake: On extreme evils; Fate, may pity take. 182. Europe, Asia, Africa, America. The worlds division, is into Four parts: So many distinct The Jewish, Christian, Mahometan, Pagan. Faiths possess Mens hearts. 183. The causes of Discord. When Sense, and Reason, be enslav'd to Will; They prove the Source, of segregating Ill. Will, Brethren sets at distance; for we see; When Will consents, Kindred do well agree. 184. The Liberal Man. The Just, to ev'ry Man, his own allow: Let Rich, have Justice; to poor, Mercy show. 185. The Temperate. Who know things Causes, who Times supervise: Bridle their Passions, Actions rule; are Wise. 186. A Wise Man. Fate governs Fools; a wise Man, curbs the Stars: His Wisdom shields him, from intended scars. 187. Upon an Infant dying before Baptism. Alas! I dy'd, before pure Water could, Mark me, A Lamb; belonging to Christs Fold. The Church implores, my Saviour would not look, For Name: Lord! write me Nameless, in thy Book. Though I want Name, yet am I known to Thee: For thy Names-Sake; be Merciful to Me. 188. The Flatterer, and Envious. Envy, and Flattery, are both content; To fall under, the same Predicament. Zoilus hates Good Mens Vertue: Gnatho will Labour; of Goodness, to defraud the Ill. 189. Love, and Friendship. With Prudence, Friendships Knot may be unty'd, To purchase Love; but on the other side: It were a foolish Fancy, to remove For fickle Friendship; a well-grounded Love. 190. St. Peter, and Paul. Empire, the Sword; Wealth, the Key signifies; Peter's Richer then Paul; as I surmise: That Paul was Poor, his Epistles record; But Peter's Pen let slip, not one such Word. 191. Socrates. You nothing know; and you know only this: To know, that you know nothing; something is: Yet that something, you understand; I shall According to directions, Nothing call. 192. A Man. No sooner Born, but you began to cry: Since Life's no Pleasure; why is't Grief to Die? 193. To Paulus, after Burial. Though you were at Birth naked; now you have, An Holland sheet; to sleep on in the Grave. You carry that away, you did not bring: Thank not your Mother Earth; for any thing. 194. To such Courtiers, as shall please to Read. Most touch upon the Schools; but few them court. Observe my humor, to divide my sport. 195. Prudent simplicity. Morality, endeavour to improve, To Innocence; as candid as the Dove. But lest good Nature, should to Mischiefs lead; To Dovelike Hands; annex the Serpents Head. 196. The eyes of the Common-wealth. Law, and Religion, are the Nations Eyes: One forbids Sins; the other, Injuries. 197. To John Gifford, Doctor of Physick. No wonder, Gifford knows Apollo's Art: Of his own Body, He knows ev'ry part. Though Know your self, was not Galen's command; To that Advice, Apollo set his Hand. 198. The Daw. Which Sister of the Grove, dares make pretence, To excel Me; in nimble Eloquence? The Goose. For some things, I my Self, may be turn'd loose: Though you Prate more; you write less then a Goose. 199. The Afflictions of Job. If you on Riches, Children, or Health look; The Devil, (by Gods Leave) away these took. When all was gone, his Wife was left behinde; Lest some small Comfort, should refresh Job's minde. 200. Pauls, and Westminster-Abbey. The Pleading Place, Exchequer, and White-Hall; Are Neighbours to St. Peters-Abbey, all. The Learned Preachers, make St. Pauls to sound; And furnisht Stationers encompass round. The two Apostles, very well agree: Most Gold, hath Peter; Paul, Divinity. 201. Against the Conspirators, upon Tuesday, the Fift of November, 1605. To make low Earth, challenge the lofty Sky; And sordid Dust, oppose the Deity: What is this, but for to revoke the Hour, And Architecture, of Confusions Tow'r? 'Twere to make wanton Ilium, once more Burn; And antiquated Chaos, should return. 202. Upon the same. VVould ye have thrust fair Troy into the Fire; And Millions thrown upon the Fatal Pyre? Were ye bewitcht, to pitch on such a Day? Tuesday was never made Ash-Wednesday. 203. The King, to his Kingdoms. News of my Death, swoln Fame did lately bring: I am not dead; By the Word of a King. 204. To England, concerning the Union. We shall enjoy Thrice-Happy Peace; since Three, Are Married to, a lasting Unity. Wales is your Wall; ev'ry Scot, is your Scout: You are secure, O England! without doubt. 205. To Tho. Nevill, an Ingenious young Gentleman. You are Branch'd from, the Noble Nevil's Race; Nature hath Limn'd both Parents, in your Face: But what of that? She likewise thought not fit, You should want Mothers, Vertues; Fathers Wit. 206. Upon the Death of Charles Blunt, Earl of Devonshire. 1606. Shall I to pin upon thy Herse, devise Eternal Praises; or weep Elegies? Fame hath of you, a double-tongu'd Report: Your Death was Good Mens Sorrow; Bad Mens Sport. 207. To the Reader. My Epigrams are short, and also few: From many short, Longitude would ensue. Reader, these few, are short; for were they Long; Few, would prove Many; and thy Patience wrong. 208. The Difference betwixt Words, and Writings. Voice is alive; Writing's Inanimate: Yet the Tongue, before Quill; resigns to Fate. Libellus de Spectaculis: Or, an Account of the Most memorable Monuments of the ROMANE GLORY. Non cuivis Lectori, Auditorive placebo; Lector &amp; Auditor, non mihi quisque placet. Owen l. 3. 1. Upon the Cæsarean Amphitheater. No more let Sun-burnt Cayro vaunt, that She, Bequeaths her wonders, to Eternitie. Let not Euphrates, in a superb Style, Brag her Wall, Girdle, unto sixty Mile. Who lends Diana confidence, to tell; Her Cedar-Statues, scorn a Parallel? What if Apollo's horned Altar, stands Unimitable, by Lysippus Hands? Let Carian Impudence, presume so far; As to make Mausoleum, kiss a Star. Dame Tellus! and thy Prodigies confer; They must kneel to the Amphitheater. This Miracle, Grac'd by Vespasian's Name: Hath the Monopoly, of checquer'd Fame. 2. Upon the Magnificent Structures built by Cæsar. Here stands a Regal Coloss; whose high Head, Is by the fixed Stars, embellished. By sumptuous Pageants, the Streets are become Accurate Emblems, of Elysium. Curst Nero's Court, foyl'd the most serene daies; By the emission of her golden Rayes. And with Reluctance, we did lately see; The Tyrants Palace, Romes Epitome. That which was then an incommodious Lake, Is made a Theater; for the Champions sake. Where tepid Baths, the sinews recreate; Was once a Victim, to the Monsters Hate. Claudius Porch, so celebrious for shade, Of the last Part, of the Domo was made. Rome's Resurrection, is ascrib'd to you; Great Emperour! your Sports, Plebeians owe. 3. The general Congratulation used to Cæsar. Most potent Sir! what Region is so rude; From whence, into your City, None intrude? The Rhodopeian Farmer, leaves cold Thrace; And to Banquet his Eyes, elects this Place. Tartarians, who quaffe Horses Bloud at Home; Are much Impatient, till they have view'd Rome. They who first give a Welcome to the Nile: And they, on whom, sweet Zephyrus doth smile. Both the Arabia's, are in rapid Hast: For perfum'd Water, Asia comes not last. Shall we omit Knot-hair'd Sicambrians; And Natures frisled Æthiopians? Their Languages are discrepant; yet All, The Father of your Countrey, can you call. 4. To the Emperour Titus, upon his Banishing Sycophants. Those Caterpillers of the Commonwealth, The Poor Mans Wolfe, whose livelihood was Stealth; Growing too Numerous, are ship'd away; To Feast the Lions, of Getulia: And those Informers, who have many sent Into Exile; now suffer Banishment. 5. Upon the same occasion. The Head of Italy, Cæsar acquits From Sycophants: New daies; Fresh Benefits! 6. Upon Pasiphae. That Minos lustful Wife, Trepan'd a Bull; Now we have seen it, is not wonderfull: Let not Antiquity, her Fictions boast: We fancy most, they should the Stage accost. 7. The Conflict of a Woman, with a Lion: As it was performed in the Amphitheater. Cæsar's Munificence, 'twill not suffice; That virile Hands, should grasp the crimson Price. Delicate Body, can't Fair Cypria shield: As well as Mars, She conquers, or is Kil'd. Alcides kil'd a Lion, and it is Blown through the world by Fame, with Emphasis. Be silent Authors! For Cæsar's command; Made this Atchievement, of a Female hand. 8. The punishment of Laureolus. Prometheus to cold Caucasus is chain'd; Whilst by his Entrails, Vultures are sustain'd: Wretched Laureolus, a Northern Bear; Very sincerely, did asunder tear. Every Vein, to weep Bloud was inclin'd: Strict search in's Carkass, could no Body finde. Thus one that stab'd his Master, must have dy'd; Or Actors of infernal Parricide. This Torment is his due, who dares Rome Fire; Or who deflowres, the Gods most sacred Quire. Obsolete Mischiefs, resalute the Stage: Fables prove True; in this our conscious Age. 9. Upon Dædalus. Since Bears impartial Teeth, thy Bones must Grinde; I wish poor Dædalus, his wings could finde. 10. The Rhinocerite. And will the debonair Rhinocerite; For Cæsar's pleasure rush into a fight? O how excessive, is his Angers flame! 'Twas Recreation, a mad Bull to tame! 11. Upon a Lion, that kil'd his Keeper. With deep Ingratitude, a Lion flew At's Keepers Throat; thus his Acquaintance slew. But he receiv'd his Wages; since he could Endure no Blows; the Hunting-spears, he should. Men must be cautelous in Carriage; since, Beasts are taught Morals; by our Gracious Prince. 12. Upon a Bear. A Bear rol'd Barrels on the bloudy Sand; And was Arrested, at Bird-limes command. There's no more need to throw, the lethal Spear; Or that a Lance, should forbid coming near. Hunts-men may chase the Birds, unto a Bay: If Fowlers to catch Beasts; conceive fair Play. 13. Upon a Sow, who cast her Pigs, by reason of a Wound. Amongst the Various Game, that Cæsar found; A nimble Spear, hapned a Sow to wound. One of the Wiser Pigs, did make a shift To escape through the Gash; at a dead lift. These were hard Throws; yet the Sow for her part; To save her Babies, wisht the other Dart. Who will dispute, Tun-belli'd Bacchus cut, From's Mother; since a Sow probatum put? 14. On the same Accident. A fatal Javelin, dig'd through the Sows side; But in a sort, She liv'd; as well as Dy'd. O what unerring Hand, gave such a Blow? None but Lucina, could so certain throw. Diana did here Hunt; yet was Midwife: A Pig was preserv'd; the Sow lost her Life. 15. The third part, to the same Tune. A sow, now great with Pig, dy'd of a wound; Through which her Litter, tumbled to the Ground. When the Dam Stagger'd, that staid not behinde: Distress will force a Pig; some wit to finde. 16. Upon the Hunts-Man Carpophorus. Can Meleager, Glory in his Boar; What may Carpophorus, who dares do more? His furbisht spear, did bore a deadly hole, In that Bears Heart; known to the Arctick Pole. One of his Trophyes, is a Lions skin; As large as that, Alcides vapour'd in. A vaulting Libard, was by his hand slain: And these, (though wonders) He can do again. 17. Concerning Hercules, Riding to Heaven, upon a Bull. That the Bull was snatch'd up into the sky; Seems not a Pageant, but true Piety. On a Buls back, Europa rid at ease; But not to Heaven; as did Hercules. Let Jove, and Cæsar's Buls, for credit Vie: Jove's did but swim; and Cæsar's Bull could flie. 18. Of an Elephants kneeling down. That devout Elephant, did ye adore; O Cæsar! which, worsted a Bull before. None taught him Homage; but by instinct, he Kneel'd down to you; because a Deity. 19. Of a Tyger, and a Lion. A fierce Hircanian Tyger, which is rare; Used to lick his Masters Hands; did dare, Upon the dreaded King of Beasts to fly: And to Amazement, won the Victory. In the thick woods, he never Triumph'd thus: Our Company, made him Magnanimous. 20. Upon the Fight of the Bull, and Elephant. VVhen the strong Bull, enrag'd by Fire, did Eye Puppies, like Men; He mounted them on High: But dreaming thus, an Elephant to toss; He was strook Dead, by the flinty Proboss. 21. Of two Fencing-Masters. Half the Spectators, Triumphus did crave; Half implor'd, they stout Myrinus might have. Cæsar was pleas'd to tell them with both hands; He condescended, to both their demands. Vulgar Resentments, were quench'd quickly, thus: O our great Lords, accomplish't Genius! 22. Upon Orpheus. What ever Hæmus polisht Vales comprise; The Theatre vouchsafes to Cæsar's Eyes. The Rocks creep from their place; Woods give the start: Splendid as Ægles, in the Western Part. The Wolf, and Lamb, the Hound, and Hare desist From enmity; to hear this Lutanist. Rare Philomel, and the Cock-Linnet, fly Hither to learn, Orphean Harmony: Yet he was rent, by an unthankful Bear: Let Thrace choose Fictions; at Rome, Truths these are. 23. The Rhinocerite. Trembling Keepers, prick the Rhinocerite; Desirous speedy Fury, to excite. When expectation began to tyre; The Beasts disturbed Calmness, fell on fire: And shew'd his Horns, could hoyst a Bear at Ease; As Buls toss untry'd Mastives, when they please. 24. Upon Carpophorus. VVhat Beast is so well Arm'd, as not to fear; Young Carpophorus, his approved spear? His strange Dexterity, Two Buls pull'd down; Two thick-skin'd Buffs, had no more Favor shown. He made a Lion leap into the Toyle: So much Time lost, the Vulgar can assoyl. 25. Upon a Sea-fight. Foreign Spectators, perchance present be; Whose Eyes did never, Cæsar's Bounty see: Naval Bellona, shan't Equivocate; In Neptunes Throne, Ceres did sit of late. But want ye Faith? after the Fight; you'l vow That is firm Land, which was Sea, even now. 26. Upon Leander. Leander wonder not, curl'd Waves thee spare; These inoffensive Surges, Cæsars are. When Tethys stopt, Love-sick Leander's Breath; And some few drops, would hurry him to Death. Thee poor Wretch begg'd; O waft Me safe to ground: When I have seen my Dear; let me be Drown'd. 27. Upon the excellent Swimmers. The docil Crue of Watry Nymphs did Vie To paint the Waves; with their Vivacitie. A threatning Trident, Anchor, scalding Oare; A stately Ship; we beheld from the Shore. Castor, and Pollux, the Pilots delight; And tumid Sail-cloaths, gratifi'd our Sight. To whose Invention, should we this refer; Did Thetis instruct us, or we, teach Her? 28. He Flatters Cæsar. If the old World Carpophorus had bred; The worst of Monsters must have hid its Head. With Greece, Cretæan Buls would have comply'd; Nor had Nemæas Lion, terrifi'd. Arcadia had contemn'd the tusked Bore; Had He strook Hydra; she had ne'r stir'd more. The triple-form'd Chimæra, at one Blow; Had perished; Medæa should not show Her Sorceries, the fiery Buls to charm; Hesio, and Andromede, from Harm; By him alone, had been preserv'd. Account Hercules Labours; they Twelve tantamount. But is that such a wonder? At one Play, Twenty wilde Beasts, Carpophorus did slay. 29. Upon a Sea-fight. The Palm of Glory, to Augustus yeeld; For framing Sea, into a pitched Field. How then may Cæsar Triumph? Such Beasts are, Guests to the Waves, as Sea-green Thetis scare. Swift Chariots track the Main; at whose approach, Triton cri'd out; Here coms King Neptune's Coach. Whilst Nereus for the Skirmishes provides; And a Whales Back, victoriously Bestrides. What Cæsar's pleasure, shall the Circk command; The Flouds React; as Mimicks to the Land. On Claudius; Nero's Lake; let Scorn reflect: Domitian's shows, merit entire Respect. 30. Of the Champions, Pristus, and Verus. When Pristus, Verus, did protract their Fight; Characteriz'd by Mars with equal Spight: For their Discharge, a joynt Consent apply'd, It self to Cæsar; by whom 'twas Deny'd. It wash the Fashion so long to contend, Till the vanquish'd made Signs the Fight should end. And to detain the People to the last, Gifts were provided; and a slight Repast: Even wounds the Sword-players did engrave; They Fought alike; on equal scores did leave. Cæsar acquitted both; gave both the Palm: Thus Prowess, for her Cure, acquired Balm. Before your Reign Cæsar, who thought to see; When Champions Fight, that both should Victors bee! Certain Select EPIGRAMS, Translated Out of the Works of that upright Lord Chancellor, and facetious Poet, S? THO. MORE, &amp;c. Did they Acceptance finde, which went before? To spéak of wit; these have Fourty times MORE. 1. To King Henry the Eighth. Plato asserts, that whatsoever was, Did but revive; shall come again to pass. As Spring and Winter, through the various Climes, Make their Appearance, at appointed Times: So after Six and thirty thousand Year, All things shal be the same, which once they were, After the Golden, came the Silver Age: Then came the Brass; and Iron the last Stage. The Golden Age is revolv'd, to your Reign: I now conceive, that Plato did not feign. 2. Upon the Union of the York, and Lancaster Roses. The White Rose was dy'd purple, by hot Jars: The Red grew pale, as let Bloud, by fierce wars. But now the Roses, mutually make One; The Strife was quenched, by this knack alone. Both Roses bud, and flourish, lively still: Although Subjected, to a single Will. One Species includes both; and both agree Copartnership, in Beauty; Majesty. They who were Parties unto either side; Shall need no more, well-wishes to divide. And He who Envies, in the Quag-mire Sticks: Astonish'd when he feels, the Rose hath Pricks. 3. Upon an ignorant Rhetorician. Five absurd Phrases, I let Flaccus have; To requite my Good Will, he Fifty gave. Take these in Hand, said He; Beyond the Seas, When I have been; you shall have what you please. 4. Upon Suspicion. Opinion bears great Sway; although I doe No hurt, I pay for't; if men count it so. So Philolaus, was by Grecians kill'd: Although a Tyrant, He was falsly held. 5. Upon the accurate Picture, of a pitiful Oratour. Sextus is silent; Hark! his Picture speaks: For Oratory that his credit breaks. 6. Upon a blinde, and a lame Begger. There's nothing more commodious, then a Friend; Who at a pinch, may his assistance lend. A Begger who had lost his eyes, did frame A League of Friendship, with another, Lame. The blinde Mans shoulders, Lame Giles did bestride: Whose Eyes directed, which way, He might ride. Concord to Cottages, sometimes resorts; When it cannot be found, in Princes Courts. 7. The complaint of a Ship, sunk in a Storm. Since when I grew, strong blasts could make me trip; What fool devis'd, to slice Me to a Ship? I could not promise safety, from the Land; How then could I, the raging Sea withstand? 8. Upon a Ships being Burnt. The daunting Ship, hath quit the foaming waves; The churlish Haven, it of life bereaves. Now 'tis on fire, ye might it Water grant: Before this time, it never us'd to want. 9. Upon a Rabbet, who having escap'd a Weasel, fell into the Hayes. I but just now got from a Weasel Free; And must I suffer worse Captivity? When from one danger, I did safe evade; A prey to Dogs, I dream'd not to be made. When Tumblers Teeth, force me to curse my Birth. The tearing out my Bowels, affords Mirth. O ye hard Hearts of Men! who in this Sort, Rage more then Brutes; what, make my death a Sport? 10. Innocency, is obnoxious to Injury. The fearful Mouse, dares venture for to bite, The vicious Man: Tush! Proverbs say not right. A Mouse dares bite the Innocent; a Knave, Out of a Dragons Mouth, himself can save. 11. Upon the Quality of Death. If all the Kings, were by you captive led; Of all the Lands, Alcides travelled; Yet your victorious Body, needs not have, More Elbow-room, then is in Irus Grave. Reflect on him; for you as poor shall die: And in your Heirs, not your own Ground, must lie. 12. Upon a Niggard. Sir, Sir! you're Poor; say others what they please: Use, Riches makes; saith Apollophanes. Whilst you use your Estate, so long 'tis thine: That ceasing, your Heir may cry; This is Mine. 13. The Spiders Hunting. A busie Fly, laying aside due Care; Was fast entangled, in a cobweb Snare. The Spider Thanks good Fortune, now she's sure To have a Dinner; Be not too secure. Arachne's Stomach, did her Anger whet; She leaps to seize the Fly, and breaks the Net. The Spiders fall, making her very faint; Away flies Spoyl-meat, from her loath'd restraint. Under the very Ax, Hope may remain: A thousand Guards, to wickedness; are vain. 14. Upon a Cynick, indiscreetly abstinent. A stubborn, and grave Cynick, set his best Side outwards, by this carriage at a Feast. None could perswade him, Radishes to Eat; Vertue abhors, such kinde of luscious Meat. Casting about his dull, unpleasant Eye; He chanc'd fine tender Onions to espie: He snaps up those. Though Radishes a'nt Good; It seems that Onions, are a vertuous Food. 15. Upon a Chamber-maid deceased. Her Body serv'd; Her soul was alwaies Free Kinde Death hath set, that too; at Liberty. 16. Upon a Fisher-man, who was faln in Love withall. A fisher, intent on the dropping Net; Cast it so well, He did a Sweet-heart get. It was a Rich mans Daughter; so that He, Prov'd Master of much Wealth, immediately. Said He, Our Trade is Gainfull! In retort, His wife made Answer; who may you thank for't? 17. Upon Mediocrity. Pindar tells us, envy'd Felicity, Surpasseth far, lamented Misery. The Rich are hated; the Poor scorn'd; God grant, I either may abound, nor suffer Want. Avant Extreams! the Mean is best of all: Peasants are kick'd; Lords, can't prevent their fall. 18. Fear is altogether unprofitable. And why so stupid, as to lend an Ear, To the false Alarms, of amazing Fear? If evils come not, then our Fears are vain: And if they do; Dread, will encrease the Pain. 19. A Cause, finely pleaded. A certain cause, was come to Tryal; where, Plaintiff, Defendant, and the Judge, Deaf were. The Plaintiff pleaded, that He had much wrong; His Cash was due, Five Moneths since. All night long, Said the Defendant, my Mill went. Why strive, Reply'd the Judge? your Mothers are alive. 20. Upon the uncertainty, of the Hour of Death. I weep not for those, conquered by Fate; I weep the fear of Death, should Macerate. 21. Upon the same. You would bewail, next Moneth to meet chill Death: And can you laugh? next Hour, may stop your Breath. 22. Upon a certain Ridiculous Astrologer. Cumæan Sybils, could not more descry; Although enlightned from Divinity; Then our Astrologer: whose profound Art, Could through the Stars, a thing, when past, impart. 23. Upon the same. The Prophet counsel'd by the Stars; did crye, No Man so happy in a Wife, as I! Looking again, when She was run away: He gravely foretold, that unlucky Day. 24. On the same. Saturns far distance, makes him think all hush: He can't discern a Hare, from a Brake-Bush. Thy Bashfull Moon, adventures not to see, Actions; improper, for Virginity. Great Jove, Europa lov'd. Kind Venus led, Stout Mars a Captive, to her wanton Bed. Sol courted Daphne. Lovely in the eye, Dame Hyrce was, of craftie Mercurie. Thy Wife securely, may spread forth her Sailes: For their own Honours, Planets can't tell Tales. 25. Death not to be feared. What Madness 'tis for Sickness, Poverty, To refuse Death; the end of Misery? That only once, inflicts a short-liv'd Pain; And that endur'd, it troubles not again. But some Diseases, are, so rude, that they, Revisit; where they lodg'd, but th'other day. 26. Upon a certain Covetous, and sordid Bishop. If old Methusalem I should outvie; The Bishops Bounty, claims my Memory. He's vastly Rich; doth many Cities owe: To his Commands, an Hundred Servants bow. Yet when, I of mean Rank, did him approach; He kindly spoke; and chid not for Encroach. Nay more, he search'd both Pockets, for the Key Of's Wine-Cellar: saying, You may be Dry. 27. Upon the Inconstancy of Fortune. Fortune observes no Method; for throughout Humane Affairs, her Wheel is turn'd about With great Inconstancy. Low things arise; High are confounded, by her quick surprize. Good Fortune, is transmuted into Ill; For to make Evill, Good; is at her will. Let not them grieve, who under hard Fates lie: Good Fortune's near at Hand: for shame don't die. 28. Upon Death. They who brag themselves Rich, shall quickly see; When Death casts their Accounts; how Poor they bee. 29. Upon a Rabbet, that was catch'd twice. I fled from a Mans hands, into a Net: Ah sad Escape! must I pay twice, a Debt? 30. Concerning Wifes. All Men exclaim, they never in their Lifes, Met such great Crosses, as their brawling wifes. Talke, is, but Talke; for should the sixth wife die; The seventh should succeed her, presently. 31. On the same Subject. A wife afflicts; yet She may usefull be: If shee'l die quickly; and leave all to thee. 32. Upon an Emperick, who sold a Drop of Balsam, very Deer. Sir Quack, his Patient told, nothing could cure, The stubborn Feaver; did He not endure, To pay for precious Balsam; to be found, With none but Him; One Drop, would cost ten Pound. Five I require, to have lay'd down, in Hand: The other, when you're well; I shall demand. But about this, there scarce can be a strife: What is ten pound, to secure a Mans Life? The Bargain's made; from a well-cover'd Glasse, A Grain of this Elixar, taken was. The sick crav'd all; as willing to be sound: No; the Remainder's worth, an hundred pound. Besides the present Dose, would stand instead: And so it did; for He was quickly dead. Unhappy Bargain! what won't the Fates do? Life was not onely lost; but Balsam too. 33. Upon a Picture, much resembling the Party. Your shadow, for your self, might almost passe: 'Tis not your Picture, but your Looking-Glass. 34. Upon a Picture, unlike. I going lately to a Painters Shop; Thy Pourtraicture, my wandring eyes did stop. I am perswaded, that He did compact, You should sit three Dayes; for to mak't exact. At the first view, I understood 'twas you: For I believ'd the Limner; swearing so. 35. Upon a Ridiculous Prognostication. A fam'd Astrologer, all Ears did fill; Saying, This year, the King of France, lies still. New Almanacks were scarcely come in Date; Before the Christian King resign'd to Fate. The Prophet persists in Defence, of's ill Roving; and askes, doth not France, now lie still? The vulgar made his speech, a common Jest; Often repeating, The French King's at rest. This Pill, the Starres Interpreter did choake; Therefore in Anger, He them thus bespoke. Ye simple Souls! are all your skulls of Lead? Doth not the King lie still; now he is dead? 36. Upon a Roman Nose. Proclus can't blow his Nose; but must confesse, Though his Hand's great; yet then his Nose 'tis lesse. Nor when he sneezeth, can He Himself hear: His Nostrils are so remote, from his Ear. 37. On a certain Fool. Flea-bitten Morio, put out the Light: Lest Fleas should see to finde Him, ev'ry night. 38. Aristotles Judgement, concerning Sleep. Half of our Lifes, to gratefull Sleep we spare; Thus half Their Time, Rich, and Poor, equal are. Crœsus, and Irus, Rich alike, are found: When silken slumbers, have their sences bound. 39. The difference betwixt a good Prince, and a Bad. A good Prince, like a Shepherd, doth defend His Flock; The Bad, like Wolfs their Sheep do rend. 40. Upon a good King, and vertuous Subjects. The Kingdom is a Man; the King's his Head: Subjects as Members, to it fastened; Make the Compositum. Who knows what smart, 'Tis for a King, with one of's Limbs, to part? The King's requited; for by filial dread: No single Subject, but adores his Head. [Accept this Banquet; and for it referre] Accept this Banquet; and for it referre Cordial Thanks; to the Just Lord Chancellour. Our entertainment, may please ev'ry Guest: Fourty choice Dishes; make a Noble feast. HEROICK EPIGRAMS, Upon Some choice Passages in the LIVES of the Twelve CÆSARS, And other worthy Subjects. By T. P. Gent. 1. Cæsar, quæsi celsus; because he was cut out of his Mothers Womb. Lucretia's Rape did such an Odium bring; That warlike Rome, could not digest a King. Vice undermines the Greatest; Rome no Place, (Much lesse a Throne) would grant the Tarquin Race. When the Republick had regain'd her Health; Consuls were chose, to steer the Commonwealth. Who, when the Waves did rage, guided their ship, By the sure Card, of a Dictatorship. Which was to last, till th'Empresse of the Night, Six times had glori'd, in a globous Light. Onely thy Sword, Great Julius! seal'd to Thee That Honour, and its Perpetuity. The Picture of thy Minde, was Limn'd by Strife; Thy Body before Birth, was Cut to th'Life. 2. Upon Cæsars Epilepsie, or Fallen-sicknesse. That Emperour whose Universal Awe, Prescrib'd both Tybur, and the Thames a Law. He whose Sword sent some Myriads of Souls, To that dark Den, where Cerberus grins, and Houls. In spight of Throne, was cast upon the Ground; His sence benighted, in a sudden Swound. He who was Victor, over what He pleas'd; Could not evade the Title, of Diseas'd: Such Physick was to's Tympany apply'd; The Fallen-sicknesse, is the Scourge of Pride. 3. Upon his Motto; Cæsar, ex utroque. Cæsar was pleas'd, himself for to expresse; By the Heroick, and rever'd Impresse; Of a Sword, and a Book. Can it be thus, That Tents, and Studies, are Synonimous? He needs must Triumph, over ev'ry Part: Who takes Auxiliaries, from Arms, from Art. 4. Venite huc. It is no News; that some Commanders will, Onely in Bushes, Saw-pits, shew their skill. How stands our Case? as Cæsar did command, So from the Hilt, He stirr'd not his own Hand. What Breast is so benumb'd, as to count light, The General should say; Come let us fight? 5. Veni, Vidi, Vici. Though Pompey, Mithridates over-threw; Pharnax his Son, began the Wars anew. Cæsar entreated, by a gremial Friend; To certifie him, when Stern Mars did end: Return'd this Note; I came, view'd, did confound; After Dispute, as by his Promise bound. If thy eyes send forth Deadly Rayes; sure then, The Basilisk hath left his Trade to Men. 6. The most Cowardly of Cæsars Souldiers, were Couragious, in Defence of his Honour. The trembling Bucks, dread their own shadows; but, Who such Bravado's, when they go to Rut? Love scorns, that any Remora should be: That's the true Sigil, moving Gallantrie. 7. Upon Cæsars Ambition. Cæsars aspiring Minde, could not concurre; With the Dictates, of a Superiour. It was more Delight to have sole Command, In a poor Cottage; and four Acres Land, Then to have had such a disastrous Fate, As might have dub'd him second, to the State. The World feeds many Millions; hath four Parts: Yet cannot Breakfast, two Ambitious Hearts. 8. Non Rex sum, sed Cæsar. Rome as a Camerade to Cæsars Fate; By name of King, did him Congratulate. They hit the Grain, for Prides Humour delights; In nothing more, then crouching Parasites. One time the Cry, remarkably was small; Cæsar laugh'd at, the accidental Fall: And demanded, whence might the Error spring; My Sirname's Cæsar; Gentlemen! not King. 9. Julio, &amp; Cæsare, Consulibus. Cæsar, and Bibulus, elected were; Joyntly the weight, of Consulship to bear. Cæsar's Activity, brought it to passe; That nothing, but by him, transacted was. And the swift Torrent, of a flowing Fame; Wash'd clean away, grave Bibulus his Name. Some Magistrates, void Cyphers we may call: Uselesse; but to make others, Decimal. 10. Upon Cæsars Horsmanship. If we to Histories submit our Creed; Cæsar with's Hands behinde, could Run full speed. There needs no Dispute, to confirm this true: That He Rid faster, then Romes Eagle flew. 11. Upon his weeping over Pompey's Head. What did thine eyes embalm Great Pompey's Head? Could it prove Sorrow, to see a Foe dead? O admirable Cæsar! very fine, Thy Brain should spend, unnecessary Brine. Yet the scal'd Crocodile, out-weep Thee can: Nay 'tis her Practise; But first Kils the Man. 12. Upon his Burning such Letters as were found in Pompey's Trunks. Equivocating Fortune gave the Day; To Cæsar; in the large Pharsalia. Among the Spoyls, that beautifi'd the Ground; Chests pack'd with Letters, the brave Victor found. Who lest they should stir Anger, was content, They should (unseen) feed Vulcan's Element. 'Twas hard to Conquer; But for to deny Himself; was the Egregious Victory. 13. Mori malo, quam Timere. Cæsar refus'd a Guard; nor did He care, To provide Barricado's against Fear. The Devil, and his Dam, can but cause Death: Why should Dread gallop, upon humane Breath? 14. Upon his robbing of the Treasury. Cæsar in time of War, did set light by, The Sacriledge of Saturn's Treasury. A Heathen would not do't, in times of Peace: Although some Saints, can swallow it, at Ease. 15. Difficilius est mihi, hoc dicere; quam Facere. Cæsars necessity made his Hands bold, To purge the inner Treasury, of Gold. Metellus resolutely did resist; Cæsar commanded quickly to desist, Or He should cease to Live. I can thee kill, with far more Ease, young Man! then say, I will. Cæsar is dead, Two thousand years ago: We finde it easier, for to Say, then Do. 16. Cæsar's Wife, should not only be without Fault, but without the least Suspition of Fault. Vertues Law is, Man thy self regulate; I can't prevent, being unfortunate. Let my Wife Answer for her self; shall I; Bear for her faults, the Brand of Infamy? Yes that you must; and for your Servants too: From the old Cock, the Chickens learn to crow. 17. Cæsarem vehis, &amp; Fortunam ejus. In a black Storm, when Hail-stones fell in crouds; And Hector Boreas, chas'd the ruffled clouds; Cæsar was in a Pinnace, void of Fear: Although the Water-man, conceiv'd Death near: You silly Boat-swain! If Neptune would drown, The Earth's great Master, he would spare his own. 18. Cæsar Sacrificing, One of the Beasts, wanted an Heart. For many Laurel wreaths, the Prince of Rome, The Gods presented, with an Hecatomb. The wise Haruspex, searching ev'ry Part; Found out one Beast quite destitute of Heart. The Sacrifice, was counted Ominous: No Heart? the Gods will not be served thus. 19. The Ides of March are come, but not past. Lillies Great Grand-father, would often say, Cæsar outlives not, Marches fifteenth day. Time being come, to run that Middle Race; Cæsar said, in Astrologies Disgrace; The Ides of March are come: and so they bee, Reply'd the Prophet; but you'l something see; Before the Ides be past. His words had grounds: Before Night, Cæsar, receiv'd twenty wounds. Avant Security! I am a Mark; And Providence, can hit Me, in the Dark: Though Dice be here; who can Predict my Cast? This Day is come; but this Day, is not past. 20. ??? ?? ??????. Cæsar, by taking on him too much State; And slighting Senators, gave Birth to Hate. This fatal Serpent, propagated More Conspirators, then are found, in Three-score. Cæsar was stab'd; and tooke it silently; Till Brutus, abhor'd damn'd Impiety; Wrested out these few words, And Thou my Son! What have the Traytors, mine own Bowels won? ? Megæra must Conclude: No sting but Hers, shall bore, Ingratitude. 21. Upon the Brightness of Augustus Cæsar's Countenance. Phœbus did not so many Rayes comprise; As were resplendent in Augustus Eyes. No wonder Light, in his Face made abode: Whose Father by Adoption, was a God. 22. Upon the styling of his Freckles, Stars. Venus Cheek hath her Mole; so fals it here; Innumerable Freckles did appear, Upon Augustus skin: But such as far, Excel'd the Common, Mimicks of a Star. That flattery which made his Eyes a Sun, Could make these Stars; by the same Art 'twas done. 23. Upon one of his Edicts. When the Great God, descended from on high; To take the vesture of Mortality: When the bless'd Jesus, was the Angels Theme; Whose Carols well-com'd Him, to Bethlehem: Unto Augustus, it seem'd to be known; For name of Lord, he durst no longer own. This Demy-God, the Honour did confer, On the Immortal, and true Jupiter. Jupiter, quasi juvans Pater. 24. Upon the ceasing of Oracles, at the same Time. If the Emperial Head, did chance to Ake; Forthwith to Delphos, Rome did Journeys take, To enquire who the Successor should be; To her redundant Soveraignity. Augustus did, on the same Message send; But Hell was cop'd; &amp; could not stand his Friend. 25. Festina lente. Augustus pleasing to reprove rash Hast, Us'd frequently this Proverb; Not too Fast. Seventy six years, his Lungs were seis'd of Breath: Perhaps he read that Lecture unto Death. 26. Upon his Magnificence. When Rome was in her Cradle, Remus Bloud, Wash'd her Foundation; with a crimson Floud. Not to be lull'd by Peace could she dispence; As if Bellona's, choicest Residence. This made the City, far unfit to be, A Chair of State, to Supreme Majesty. But in Augustus Reign, fierce Mars did cease: And from mean Houses he rais'd Palaces. That which was lately, Brick, now chang'd its Pitch: And Pharian Columns, did the Street enrich. Rome now, or never, had atchiev' her Prime: Augustus found Materials, and Peace, Time. 27. Upon his Impartiality. The Commendamus, which Augustus gave His Sons; was only this; Pray let them have My glorious Crown; Provided that they be, Worthy the Diadem of Majesty. The Commonwealth keeps Jubilee; is Blest: VVhen great Men chiefly minde, her Interest. 28. Upon the Temple of Janus, being shut. The Dove cal'd Concord, had Release a while; From Melancholy limits, in Exile. Swords became useless; no sad Clamour fils, The sublime Convex, of the Quirine Hils. Rome lockt up Janus Temple: what was He, The Two-fac'd God, cited in Poetry? For looking Back, perhaps he deserv'd Praise: But looking Forward, Janus was accounted the God of War, as well as Mars. He could see our daies. And let him exercise, both Eyes, and Minde; His Temple shut, He's like no more, to finde. 29. Upon his Gaming. Augustus was not spotted with much Vice, Yet He was Proud, and hugely shak'd the Dice, Antony out-threw all, but him Alone: Who by a lucky Passage, won the Throne. 30. Upon his Humanity. The Eagles Talons did so gripe the Jews, That to pay Tribute, they durst not refuse. Augustus wil'd the Publicans to stay, From grudg'd Collections, on the Saturday: Upon Morality, Men may dispence, With smaller Lapses; done in Conscience. 31. Upon Tiberius Cæsar's Speech; Thoughts, and Words, should be Free; in a free State. The smallest Dust, doth trouble much the eye; The lightest Blow, bruises a Monarchy. How came Tiberius to unbarre the Tongue? To coyn Pretences, to Hang Old, and young. Extensive Freedom! Men may Scot-free prate: Not ev'ry Man, but they who want Estate. 32. A good Shepherd onely shears his Sheep, &amp;c. None could perswade Tiberius, to play The Tyrant, for a while; nor would He lay Taxations on the Provinces. The Wool, A carefull Shepherd clips; Kings must not pull, Their Subjects skins over their Eares. 'Tis right; But, who Complements thus? An Hypocrite. 33. Upon his forbidding Kisses. Tiberias by a promulg'd Edict, Prohibited Salutes: what, what, so strict? Yes, yes, for He ador'd the Stews. Just so, Mall must not Kisse; although her Madam do. 34. Tiberias was rare Good at Ex Tempore. Premeditated Thoughts, quite lost their Edge; His Nest was Feather'd, though his Words not fledge. Gifted Tiberias! 'twas no Disgrace: Dear St. revive: thou'lt have an Elders Place. 35. Oderint, dum Probent. Rome was his Ladder, to the regal Throne: For to requite her Love, let him alone, Who likes her Hatred. How? None disapprove, But thee Biberius! their Subjects Love. 36. Upon his using the Laurel, as a Shield, to protect him against Lightning. When as a fiery exhalation ror'd; And through the Middle Region, Passage bor'd: Tiberias fortifi'd his Kingly Brow; With the prov'd Helmet, of a Laurel Bough. The due Possessor, Laurel frees from Harms: Not Envy's Thunder-Bolt, can pierce such Arms. 37. It was a Capital Crime to name a Goat, before Caius Caligula. A wanton Hee-Goat, hath not moyster Pores; Then that shag'd Monster, which proud Rome adores. Hence was it made High Treason for to say, A Goat; in Presence of Caligula. A slight reflection, Princes Glory blots: Before the Moon, forbear to talk of Spots. 38. Upon his wish, that some Eminent Mischief, might befall; during his Reign. Caius had a mishapen Body; Face, Exceeding Wan; nor did fair vertue Grace, His inward Parts: yet the Audacious Clod, Commanded Worship, to himself; as God. You needed not to wish Calamity; What Plague can exceed, such a Prodigie? 39. Upon his Cruelty. Caligula's Bloud-thirsty Soul, did rave, To send a Man, to an untimely Grave. Through the mistake of Name, a wrong was slain. Mercilesse Caius, did the Fact maintain; For He deserv'd it too. An apt Pretence! He merited the Ax; through Innocence. 40. Upon his Dissimulation. Caius a mediate Descent could frame, From him, who yellow Tyber gave a Name. This cast Foundations; but the regal Chaire, Became his Seat; by leading life so faire. But when he felt the Gratifying Crown: Deboshed Clodius, could not put him down. Whilest Vices Wings are clipt, it can't soare high: Honour's the Touchstone, of Morality. 41. ??? ?? ????? ??, ?? ?????. A Grecian Lawyer's Impudence, did quote Claudius Dotage, and as Fool him note. Princes should not let loose the Reins. A Frog, Trampled his King; when Jove threw down, a Log. 42. Upon his ridiculous Resolution. Claudius was half resolv'd, by his Edict; To concede. Leave, Wind might no more afflict, The Entrails; detain'd by Civility; At Feasts, at Banquets, the Guts might let fly. His Nostrils alwayes wept: you might suppose, Before I told you this; He wanted Nose. 43. Upon Nero's feigned Clemencie. The Bloud-Hound Nero, when desir'd to set His Hand to fatal Warrants; us'd Regret. And to prevent th'Incursions of Hate; In mercie wish'd himself, Illiterate. Whence was his Quill, in writing obstructed? The Ink was Black; and He lik'd none but Red. 44. Upon his Quinquennium. Till Sol had kiss'd the Equinoctial Line, Ten times; in Nero, Vertues Rays did shine. After five years, He did degenerate; And prov'd a Vulture, to the Roman State. Most Kings make Good beginnings; Few endure: A Murtherer, waits till He seems secure. 45. Occidar modo Imperet. When Nero's Embryo, did his Mother fill; She search'd the Bowels of Chaldean skill: Would'st know his Fortune? Thy Issue shall be, A King; thy Life shall feel his Tyrannie. Pride swell'd her Joy, that she could not refrain; Let my Son kill me; so my Son may Reign. Her wishes took Effect; Nero was kinde; To observe punctualy, his Mothers minde. 46. Upon his inhumane Wish. Nero hearing one say, that when he dy'd, He car'd not if the Earth in Fire were fry'd; Belch'd forth this wish; O might I live to see, The World grone under, that Catastrophe! 'Twere frivolous Alecto should so do: Thy Tyranny, may serve both Her and You. 47. Upon his being deluded by the Oracle. Nero consulting Delphos Oracle, How long His Soul might in her Palace dwell; Receiv'd this Answer: Very carefull be; To ten times seven, when there's added Three. This Age from Nero far remote appears: His own were counted, and not Galba's years. When on Destruction, the Gods are intent: They use Security; as Instrument. 48. Upon his inordinate Delight in Musick. Blest Agrippina! your Dear Son can tell, To Tune an Harp; and play a Lesson well. Why should his Faculty incurre dislike? As great as He, have learn'd to play Mardike. 49. Upon Sulpitius Galba's Deformity. Galba long since, did lose becoming Hair: Extreamly crooked, both Hands, and Feet, were. 'Tis strange his Honour, seven Moneths should stand: Who was defective in Head, Feet, and Hand. 50. Upon his Studies. The Study of the Laws, did Galba please; Better then other, charming Sciences. When Princes want the Knowledge of the Law: 'Tis Tyranny, not Reason, keeps in Awe. 51. Upon Salvius Otho's Perruck. Deformed Otho's Hair, was spred so thin; That to wear False, He accounted no Sin. What did our Fashions, lie in Otho's Road? Yes, if his Perruck, were cut A la Mode. 52. Upon his Curiosity. Five hundred times a Day, the Looking-Glasse, Commended Otho, for a cleanly Face. This Fool to make it Fair, Sops did apply: Had He no Wife, to learn him Mercury? 53. Upon the Justice of Aulus Vitellius. Those, who with Galba's Bloud had their Hands stain'd; To suffer death, Vitellius constrain'd. He, who was thus precise, was no whit Nice; To plunge Himself, into the Mire of Vice. One Swallow makes no Summer. Vertuous call Rulers, when Vertue, is Habitual. 54. Upon his Gluttony. Two thousand Fishes, and seven thousand Fowl, Once Feasted this, Epicurean Soul. But He was granted, but eight Moneths command: A compleat year, might have starv'd half the Land. 55. Upon Flavius Vespasians Vertue. Vespasian during his Privacie, Led such a Life, as was Exemplary. The Souldiers Love, ordained him the Chair: He grew more High; and his Demeanour Fair. In the 12 Cæsars, (O how frail are Men!) Honour made but Two better; Worser, Ten. 56. Upon his Avariciousnesse. None could Vespasians Impositions flie, But, who were troubled, with the Strangurie. His manifest Extortions, were so vile; That Rome was taxed, ev'ry Pissing while. 57. Upon Titus Vespasians sweet Disposition. Debonaire Titus, rejoyc'd to confer Benefits, on the sad Petitioner. His Love kept Sentinels; lest some by chance, Might return, with dejected Countenance. His Subjects were his Sons. They well assign'd. His Epithite; The Darling of Man-kinde. 58. Upon his Assiduity in Goodnesse. The Days bright Father, had hid profuse Light; Under the Curtains, of a Pur-blinde Night: When good Vespasian publickly did say; Alasse my Friends! I did no good this Day. Fame take a Note; Rome the like never Bred. Vespasian was a God; and yet not Dead. 59. Upon Flavius Domitians Timerousnesse. Domitian the tedious Day did passe, In Galleries; forging a Looking-Glasse; By help of the Phengites Stone. His Minde Was hugely intent, to observe behinde. His Cruelty, had run much on the Score: He look'd Behinde; He should have look'd Before. 60. Upon Domitians private Recreation. Childish Domitian, no Pastime did prise; To the Heroick Turnament, at Flies. Let Hercules Nemæan Lyons kill. Or Julius, with admiration fill, The Worlds dimensions; who, did disarray, The Two and fiftieth, hot Battalia. Fierce Meleager, vapours in a Boare. Let thy Carpophorus, kill Twenty score; Of short-Neck'd Bears. What should Domitian trie, Dangers so Evident? A Flie, a Flie. Epigrams upon Various Subjects. 1. To His Serene Highnesse, Richard, Lord Protector, &amp;c. Augustus was most lovely in the Eyes, Of Romes Grave Senate; who did Eternise His Fame; and without Arguings agree, To Honour him; with Pater Patriæ. In a Pacifick, and auspicious Hour, You made an Ingresse, to the Supream Power. Your sweet Demeanour gives, publick Content: Love, Candor, finde but few, Malevolent. Your Father Julius was; Augustus be: Your Countreys Father; Mecœna's to Me. 2. To the Right Honourable, the Lord Chief Justice Glyn. One of your Predecessors, pleas'd to tell Posterity, that the Law, is a WELL. Men are the thirsty Buckets, which receive, More, or lesse Water; as, Reason gives Leave. There's an Eternal Spring; or else no doubt, You had long since; drawn all the Water out. 3. To the Right Honourable Oliver. St. John, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas. Where ever Sol emits his innate Light, On purpose to transport the drowzie Night; The English valour will endure the Test: Nor do her Lions fear, the Eagles Nest. Had Britain many Nestors like to you: She should be as Renown'd, for Wisdom too. 4. To the Right Honourable, the Lord Chief Baron Widdrington: And his Brother, Mr. University-Orator. And did the Juncto of the Gods agree, To make you Sol; your Brother, Mercury? Nature doth seldome so exhaust her Store, Of Ingenuity; as to make more Then one wise, in an House: ye needs must be, Chronicl'd, for an happy Prodigie. You Grace the Law; your Brother's words dispence, To his Admirers; Flowrs of Eloquence. Learning about to die, these late sad Wars: Ordained yee, Her Co-executors. 5. To Sir Edmund Prideaux, Attorney-General. If Law, if Rhetorick, my Muse avow; In you Enthron'd; I sing, what all Men know. Of your great Vertue, most are Ignorant: How Charitable unto those that want! You have found out, the untrack'd path to Bliss: To sue for Heaven, in Forma Pauperis. 6. To those Excellent Conveyancers, Sir Orlando Bridgman; and the worthy Mr. Geofry Palmer. Wise Greece, &amp; Rome, did both in this combine; To make addresses, to the Delphian Shrine. And with divine Apollo to advise; Was the Preludium of an Enterprise. Few English men, dare purchase an Estate; Unless your Wisdom's unsophisticate The Title vouch. Ye can stop Hymens way; For Portions, Joyntures, both Sexes must pay, Due Thanks. Wise Fathers, Ranters keep in awe; Craving from ye (the Oracles of Law) Help to entail their Lands: Whilst your selves be, Tenants of Riches, of Renown, in Fee. 7. To Mr. Recorder, of the celebrious City of London. Your Pupil London, did a great while Long; To have a learned Head, and fluent Tongue. Now she vaunts happy Fortune, for to you, All sorts those two, rare Faculties allow: Pallas, and Suada, Triumphant are seen: May you for ever flourish; long be Green. 8. To the Learned Lawyer, and Eloquent Pleader, Henneage Finch, Esquire. The divine Samian guess'd aright, in this; That Souls affect, a Metempsycosis. The Penetration of Dimensions be; Not dissonant, from my Philosophie. For two great Finches Souls, the Sages know; (Pardon the Phrase,) concorporate in you. 9. To his Honoured Cousin Edward Peck, of the Inner Temple, Esquire. Certain set Forms, fixt in the Memory; Almost accomplish, for the Chancery. It matters not, in what your Practice lies: Your Law, your Love, are no Formalities. 10. To a certain old Barrister. Grave Monsieur Plowden, elected a time, To tell my Father, Law's not writ in Rythme. Ergo I must the two-topt Mount defie, And give my Vale unto Poetry. Were not thy skin good Buffe; my Muse should send The Long-nail'd Furies; which thy soul should rend. I have fierce Satyrs, that can assault Hell: Dash out Medæas Brains, in spight of spell. Reclaim an unback'd Impudence. Make Bleed, A Rock: And stab the fell Medusa's Head. And dares thy empty Skull, bandy at Me? Lord Paramount of gross Stupidity! 11. To his most indulgent Grandmother, Mrs. Anne Talbot. They who on Æsculapius Altars tend, To my slack Memory, this Notion lend; That Children who are sent abroad to Nurse; Delight in them; and Love their Mothers worse. If such Affection, in Cradles appears; What Love may you expect, from mature years? Your greatest Study, was my Life to save: Your self was prompt, to Bail Me from the Grave; When Tissical distempers, stopt my Breath; And my clog'd Wind-pipe seem'd to whistle death. I beleeve Nature, only gives Me Day; That in some sort, I might strive you to Pay. 12. To his Honourable Father. I must acknowledge my Life did commence, From you; (Dear Father) Thanks to Providence. Who ordain'd you Agent, for what was done: I could not choose a Father; you, a Son. Reflecting on the Will, we Actions call, Vertues, or Vices: yours was General. An Heir was wish'd; but you could not foresee, My Sex; my VVit, or my Stupidity. For Birth, my Muse shall grateful Hymns rehearse; In praise of him who made the Universe. My dutiful Devoirs to you are ty'd: For my Well-being, 'cause you thus Provide. 13. To his Honourable Mother. Mother-in-Lawes, Poets much Vilifie; You, did I never; no, not secretly. When own Mothers prove Sowre, Unnatural; Mother-in-Laws; Sons, may them aptly call. She that is not by Nature, yet may be An Own Mother, by sweet Indulgency. I shall endeavour Duty to improve; According to the Merits, of your Love. You shall not lose those Favours, you lend Me: This is the Time, for my Retaining Fee. 14. To his Highly valued Uncle, Thomas Pecke of Spixworth, Esquire. VVhen as it was my happy Chance to lie, Sucking sweet Milk, from th'University: My happy Fortune, prompted you to hold, Fast my Affection by the Threads of Gold. But now the Scene is chang'd. You'l not confer Your Cash, but on the sprightful Traveller. What though you cannot push me into France? Though you cease Piping; still my Love shall Dance. 15. To the worthy Mr. Philips, late Usher of the Free-school of Norwich. When Languishings gave leave, I went to School, To you kinde Sir! your Favours made Me whole. I cannot Chide your Passion, for a Blow: Not whipping then, makes me obsequious now. 16. To his very loving School-master, Mr. Tho. Lovering. My weak endeavours you were pleas'd to prise; As hating, over Lads, to Tyrannize. Indulgence made my School-boyes Life a Sport; You did not Lash to Study; but Me Court. This, this, perswades him, to remain your Friend; Who may perhaps prove witty, in the End. 17. To his Endeared Tutor, Mr. Will. Naylour, Senior Fellow, of Gon. and Cai. Colledge in Cambridge. To your Protection Sir! my Muse doth flie; As conscious of her Imbecilitie. It were Impiety, to question now; The Residence of Candour, on your Brow. Frequent Experiments made Manifest; She as Queen Regent, triumphs in your Breast. I that am Flint, to whatsoever Threat; And can't be Anvil'd, to a base Regret: From things displeasing to you, did refrain: Nor were your Moral Lectures read in vain. The Curb of Tutor, did not chafe my will: This made Me Obey then; and Honour still. On Pain of Death, I durst not too much Rove: Lest I should seem a Rebel, against Love. 18. To the highly deserving Dr. Love, Master of Corpus Christi Colledge in Cambridge. When first I read the Orphean History, I conceiv'd it a gem of Poetry. I must recant my error; That is True: For very Fresh-men, Beadles, adore you. 19. To the learned Doctor Brown. Rare Oculist! whose Genius did devise, To cut the Cataracts, from Vulgar Eyes. The Sun-shine of your Learning, brought the day: And chas'd the Fogs of Ignorance, away. Your Universal Judgment, search'd about: And put Gray-bearded Errors, to the rout. Yet Modesty made you mistake. Most True, A Phœnix exists. The world, Brown, doth owe. 20. To the Celebrated Doctor Scarborowe. Psyche close vail'd, from Galen made escape; Nor could he view her Entrails, in an Ape. What dissect Beasts? you are far more precize: Galen himself, you dare Anatomize. 21. To the Honourable John Lord Herbert. May my Pen venture, to approach a Name; Long since, Espous'd to an Immortal Fame? Deflowr'd Astræa, in a Sable weed; For your Grand-father, did not weep, but bleed; Till she saw you, who are intent to awe; Audacious Vice, and by your Life, vouch Law. 22. To the Honourable Lord Richardson. Our Virgin-Queen, beheld with great content; Our Sister Suffolk's, happy Government: But till her Progress; she knew not the Cause; To be the Gospels Marriage unto Lawes. When to meet her the Justices did Ride; Not one but had a Chaplain by his side. To Love the Learned, Pious Clergy; is, Vertue describ'd, without Periphrasis. You are the Obadiah, who do feed The Prophets of the Lord: Relieve their Need. Whilst you continue, in this devout way: My Muse shall sing; and let the Clergy Pray. 23. To those Eminent Members of Parliament, Sir Horatio Townshead; and Sir William Doyle. Our Mother Norfolk trusting in your Care, As to Heroick Spirits, and sincere; Elected ye as Guardians to us all: As Good Fathers, let not your Children fall. Ye who a splendid County represent; Must strive to Give, the wiser sort content. A joynt consent, made ye our Supreme Parts: Your vertues, attract to our Heads; our Hearts. 24. To the Noble Sir William Paston. Your Recreation, is to feed your Eyes, With the most select Things, the Globe comprize. I know the Medium to let you see A wonder; Englands choicest Rarity. Advance to the reflecting Looking-glass: There you may view, the Fam'd Mecœna's Face. 25. To his highly valued Cousin, Will. Bloys, Esq; Author of that celebrated Book, call'd Modern Policy. I am a Servant to Morality; And (thanks your Worth) Cousin to Policy. I must be Vertues Page; lest I fall on The Tortures, of your Colasterion. 26. To the grave and wise Gentleman, Mr. Tuthill. To select you from others of your Name; The Epithite of Lord, the Vulgar frame. Let them call Lord, I shall style you a King: Who to subjection all your passions bring. 27 To the Fair Lady, his Daughter. Acquaintance with your Father, Me commands; Humbly to Kiss your Ladiships snow-Hands. I dare not approach nigh; accept my Muse: As she's a Virgin, you cannot Refuse. I shall not muster up Hyperboles; To make you Rival, to the Deities. Pallas, your Soul; Juno, your Fortune Grace: Venus sits smiling, on your lovely Face. You need no Poetry: these great Truths are; That, Madam! you are Vertuous, Wise; Rich, Fair. 28. To that profound Grecian, Mr. Duport, President of Trinity Coll. in Cambridge. The witty Limner, ancient Poets fed; With that which admir'd Homer vomited. Your curious Palat, hated that crude Meat; Homer himself, you disjoynted; and Eat. And lest his Children, should the Fact reveal; You devour'd them too: the succeeding Meal. 29. To his worthy Friends Work, John Sherman, B. D. Author of that Pious Work, styl'd White Salt. Rather then be ungrateful, I express My high respect, in this so rude a Dress. What though my Muse is Lame, my Love shan't Halt: Nor shall she vend, a cornel of Bay-Salt. 30. To the Egregious Poet, Sir Will. Davenant. That Ben, whose Head, deserv'd the Roscian Bayes; Was the first gave the Name of Works, to Playes. You his Corrival, in this Waspish Age; Are more then Atlas, to the fainting Stage. Your Bonus Genius, you this way display: And to delight us, is your Opera. 31. To his Adopted Uncle, James Howel Esquire. VVhen first propitious Stars conceded Me, The sweet enjoyment, of your Company; I was Adopted: your Pity thought fit, I at these years should be alli'd to wit. Lest I should shame your choice, I will Improve: And fall to study, in Dodona's Grove. 32. To the lover of Ingenuity, Tho. Stanly Esq;. Nature in the unfathom'd Stagyrite, Compos'd a Body, abject to the sight. Fortune is more Close-fisted; for we finde, Few Poets Rich; but only in the Minde. Nature, Fortune, in you Cooperate: Your Parts are Great; Plentiful, your Estate. A Poet, Rich, a Mecœnas you be: Can our Age Parallel in One, these Three? 33. To his Loving Friend, Mr. Payn Fisher. How few are English Poets! but a Brain, That can reach Ela, in the Latine strain; Is no small wonder. Rare in both you be: An Ambodexter in true Poetrie. 34. To Mr. John Ogilbie. Your sparkling Genius I then did prise; When you poor Æsop, pleas'd to Manumise. I sacrifice these Lines, lest I alone, Should prove the Cock; &amp; slight a precious Stone. Were Maro now alive, He must you prise: And by you, Homer, shall regain his Eyes. 35. To his Loving Friend Edmund Wharton, M. A. and Fellow of Gon. and Cai. Coll. in Cambridge. Over three Lustrums, Time hath almost flown; Since your Acquaintance, I desir'd to own. When Age adopted, you were at Expence, Of Time, and Brains; to purchase Eloquence. Nor would you let profound Philosophy, Be exempt from a serious Scrutiny. Run on the Race; be ever Fortunate: I wish you egresse, at Honoris Gate. 36. Upon Home-Spun, One of the Ordinary sort of Preachers. Buy a Gold Chain, you must entreat true weight: And 'tis a Favour, not to meet Deceit. If sheets of Vulgar Lead, you please to Buy: Ask a Pound over, Plummers can't Deny. Chrysologus will stand, but just his Hour: Battus cries out, My Lungs will hold for four. 37. An Epigram, that should have been inserted, into a Book of the Authors, called Advice to Balaams Asse: under the Emblem of a Dog, barking at the Moon. When Phœbe's Glory, the Curre did espy; He flash'd out Lightning from a Threatning Eye. And what's the Reason? what? you may guesse soon: People kick him, while they admire the Moon. Just so our Momus, snarls at Osborns Prayse: 'Cause his own Merits cannot reach the Bayes. 38. There was also intended for that Book, the Picture of an Asse, (in reference to the Title,) with this Epigram. We burthen not the dumb Asse, which you see: Our Pen must scourge, lavish Garrulitie. No shame to teach a Prating Brute: Alasse, It was an Angels Task; to stop an Asse. 39. Upon the Parliament, that voted down the Universities. VVhen infant Vipers to the Light do come, They kill their Dams; by knawing of their Womb. A Generation, Bald-pate Time ne're Ey'd: That durst concurre, in voting Matricide. Such Vipers as could not their Stings refrain: Had not a Pia Mater, to their Brain. 40. Upon Owen. Fertilis Autumno, pinguescat Vallis opimo: Aurea saxosis, Mons habet Exta locis. Anglia Doctrinæ, lætis ditescat Aristis: Jactat Odœnum, Wallia sioca Tagum. Let crouded Wheat, the humble Valleys line: The steril Mountains Bowels, with Gold shine. Let England boast Sagacity: Since Wales, Can with her Golden Owen turn the Scales. Verses made Ex tempore, and writ in a Ladies book; occasioned by a Friends recital, of that well-known Fancy of Doctor Corbets; Little Lute, when I am gone, &amp;c. And referring to the Covers of a singing Book, Painted with Slips of Flowers, to several statues, which were there view'd; and bitter Cherries, tasted of by the Author. The Lady being absent, &amp;c. 1 When my voracious Eyes first lent a Look, Unto the Florid Covers of thy Book; I fondly thought this happy Hour, Might blesse Me with my wished Flower. 2 But since my Hopes deluded Me; I went, And some sad Musings, in the Garden spent. Where I, 'cause thou wert Absent, (Dearest Love) Became the statue of a mourning Dove. 3 My sights swift wheels rapidly roul'd about, That it some friendly moisture, might find out, To quench my flaming Brest. Alasse, Thou hid'st thy Rayes, and I dim-sighted was. 4 At last, a smiling Cherry, did invite Th'Embraces of, my gasping Appetite; My Taste expected Bitternesse did meet: In all the World, for onely thou art sweet.</field>
