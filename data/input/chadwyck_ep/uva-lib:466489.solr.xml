      <field name="fulltext">HUMAN FATE. A POEM. Saturday, 12th November, 1831. He, whose good fate has plac'd him in the lap Of competence and ease, may look with scorn And pity mingled with severe reproach On him, who struggles with the waves and winds. All seems to him a strait and lucid path. He shrugs his shoulders, and in accents smooth He gives advice: and then with voice oracular Tells us that trouble is the lot of man. He has no trouble but of dull ennui! He, who denies the facts which every day Obtrude themselves upon his eyes and ears, In blind obedience to a doctrine false, Prattles the nonsense, which revolts his heart: Mankind are not alike to happiness Or evil born! Some in the cradle lie, Ere conscience operates, in pain and sickness Surrounded by discordant tones and curses, And destin'd to temptation, and to wrong! Others upon the bed of Fortune thrown, With goodness round them, health, and smiling pleasure, Have nothing to withdraw them from the paths Of rectitude and wisdom, or benign Sympathies for the pangs of fellow beings! He, who from earliest childhood has alone Been conversant with want, oppression, artifice; Who not the lessons of the sage and virtuous Has learn'd; but cries of ravenous hunger, thirst, And pinching cold, and “comfortless despair,” Must steel his heart, unless a mighty spirit Of fortitude heroic, and sublimity, Inform, direct, enlighten human frailty! Sunday, 13th November. Happiness cannot without knowledge be; But knowledge only is not happiness! To know and not to follow is a curse Where keen regret cankers all genuine pleasure. So knowledge draws the veil from those delusions Which may the seeds of future woe conceal— But knowledge is not in the power of all. Who works for daily bread by bodily sweat Can only by some rare exertion gain it When rarest genius guides his mighty efforts. So Burns acquir'd it! And the obstacles Of poverty and humble labour conquer'd, So shines he in resplendent glory high! From ignorance, from narrow selfishness, Which is but ignorance, all wickedness, Springs;—we believe that joy is, where it is not; The robber steals to t'enjoy, or to avoid The pangs of famine, but the gain possesses No zest. If leisure, discipline, and conscience Reigning o'er native faculties of mind Alone can gain instruction—strict wisdom, How sparingly are those rich blessings given! The native feelings of the heart by long And most severe controul may turn from bad To good: but when does human frailty give Examples of such painful self-denial? An outward cover to the vicious movement Of a Satanic bosom may be worn But all within too probably impels Its course along the channels nature prompted! Then who shall say, that equal happiness Is spread within the reach of all mankind? Of some the destiny is solitude, Obscurity, neglect, and hard privation, Or leisure dull in dull scenes and dull climes. But all the various shapes of human misery Where effort cannot Fate's decree surmount Who shall describe? Virtue is not th' attainment Of a fix'd point; but length of distance gone From whence it starts. Among the first of virtues Is to learn wisdom, and detect the mingled Colours of light and shade in moral truths. Acutely and profoundly to consider Our intellectual and our moral duties And study to pursue what mental conscience After long meditation dictates to us. But ah! how few can from their own resources Conclusions draw, or into order throw The thoughts that mistily upon the mind Obtrude themselves! They come and go as quick E'en as they come, and leave no trace behind! But he, who first digests, and brings the fruit To ripe maturity, and then preserves it In language clear and durable, performs A task becoming intellectual worth! There ever is disquiet in the mind That nothing does:—it feels a painful torpor And with itself is peevish and dissatisfied. We live but lightly, on the types of memory, Which to the bosom's deep recesses come not! We prattle of them, but no active faith Have we: as toys we take them and reject! That which is drawn from inmost meditation Upon the elements of sage observance Mingles with all the veins of our existence We give our full belief, and have conviction In heart, in fancy, conscience, as in head! All but the few, whom gifts of Providence With mental powers of strength original Have favour'd, keep their course like silly sheep Following their leader with blind confidence Their theoretic lessons for sole ornament They take, and act as those around them act. Wantonly to repeat betrays a bosom Of levity;—but to repeat designedly To delude others with pretence of goodness, Is the deep hopeless crime of curs'd hypocrisy. Rightly to apprehend the mysteries Of earth, and its most polish'd human habitants Exalts the faculties of enjoyment in us; But with it comes the keen and dire perception Of wrongs and follies, which the heart embitters, Then morbidness surmounts the pure delight Of senses open to creation's charms. The spells that play upon the surface, better Perchance may frail humanity befit! Without reflection, or comparison They take what offers to th' untroubled mirror Of their slight intellects; no poignant thoughts Of past or future intervene to throw Clouds on the gentle sunshine of the moment. The sting of recollection is not theirs; Nor terror of the storm that in repose Lies hush'd; full gather'd in the distant sky. Thus then, may seem, equality is brought, And counterbalances for nature's treasures. Darkly we see, and e'en the wisest see We know not why we are so fearfully Made, and so contradictory in nature. Misfortune oft upon the heels attends Of Virtue and grand qualities of mind, And never quits them! It may be defect Of worldly cunning, and the serpent's wisdom. To semble and dissemble, is the art To be successful in this life of falsehood! And politicians play a game of trickery In private paths, as in affairs of state! Who are the rich? and how gain they their treasures? How rare is new-got wealth with honesty Acquir'd! The gambles of the Stock-Exchange; Its lies habitual and incessant; frauds Of foulness horrible, and unsuspected, Extortion from the blood of famish'd faith; Plunder of public funds, and perjury, And murder of the innocent;—too oft Whole tribes and nations! and then daily pilfer By little and by little in all dealings; And Jewish interest, and cruel loans Of mean deception to necessity! Such is too oft the scource of new-got riches! Were Riches but the power to benefit Our suffering fellow-beings,—wipe the tear From misery and want, and lift the good And highly-gifted with the ornaments And strength of native talent, or great hearts, Then by all virtuous means, at least, we might Desire it, and put forth our efforts for it: But e'en when honestly inherited, Or gain'd by virtuous means, how rarely is it Dispens'd for good, or innocently us'd! How oft it pampers indolence, that generates Ennui, and feebleness, and rank disease! And then the mind and heart deteriorate, And lose the intellectual rank of man! A sensual course of wearisome existence Riches may give; and as a cypher man May pass along to a forgotten grave, But in an honourable fame alone Is consciousness of pure and deep-felt joy. How many painful labours, perils, torments, Privations, insults, calumnies, diseases, Does it outweigh! When cold neglect, and rude Reproach hang over us to blight and paralyse Our steps, a beam wakes in us, and dispels The trembling chill, and backward drives the arrow. When we alone in the dark desert pick Our way, the distant gleam comes glowing Gradual, then blazes on our thorny path, And right before our feet a certain guide Of joy to temples mounted in the air Of splendor, and aërial notes, becomes! Read but the tale of Genius; infelicity Through the chief tenor of the outward life Attends it; such was Dante, Tasso, Milton, Otway, and Collins, Burns, and gentle Bloomfield! And magic Chatterton! We know their miseries; We know not the intensity of their raptures! But the rapt spirit, which has suffer'd here From senses too refin'd for human concourse, Assuredly will in an higher sphere Enjoy its recompence—Eternity Seems here in matter, not in mind: the river Rolls, as it roll'd thousands of years ago! And mountains lift their heads, and forests wave And shade and whisper, and to tempests echo, The same: but numberless successive races Of human beings start, live, turn to dust, Nor leave a visible atom of existence! Where are the countless millions of the spirits That once inform'd an earthy shape—departed? Have they by transmigration more than once Pass'd through the trial of this frame of clay? Whence came each Spirit? from what other world? Who shall conjecture? Some there are, who seem To bring with them the tints of other worlds, And throw them on this globe's more rude creation. Indignantly they thus, perchance, consort With beings of a less etherial rank, And to some temporary destiny Of essence more degraded are condemn'd. And then their finer texture ill can suffer The weight of atmosphere for mortals fitted: But sink by torture, or by slow decay, And gladly from a world they hate escape, Ere half the days of man's allotted space! Oh! eloquent and sensitive young Bard, Painter of Clifton's Grove, who though of birth Seemingly humble, and by occupations Parental that the heart make hard surrounded, Yet melted with all tenderness, and music, As harps before the breeze that whisper love! Thou wert some Spirit sent from seats of bliss, Where all the Muses sing symphonious airs. For what mysterious cause we dare not guess, But short thy trial was, and to congenial Climes in the skies wert thou transported soon: The turf lies light upon thine earthly relics, And tears bedew them ever; and sweet flowers Spring up; and nightly notes of harmony Aërial over them, and round about, Sound, as if magic on the spot was playing! Monday, 14th November. Many there are who think that accident Opens the fountain wheels alike to all Common—produces inward the same waters, But only to a few are these same waters Of purity and holy spirit given! We lead a life of lost and anxious care Honours to win, which some pronounce a breath, An empty bubble! and which, after all, As Falstaff says, Detraction clouds and covers! But when the swelling treasures of the soul Are full, they, like the smouldering flame, will find A vent, and out! The images that play Upon the mirror of the mind, will pierce And burst the veil, and strive to show their shapes, And tints of bright magnificence and beauty Before a wondering world! But if they were The mirrors which reflected only forms External, much of value they would lose. By some mysterious power they represent Forms of their own creation, or inspir'd By visions, as it seems, of other worlds! The spectacles this earthly scene of things Exhibits are sublime; but much they have not, In their material essence, which the mind Of Genius gives them! It is magical, The spell that wakes such wonders! As a dream Is all the beauty that the Bard brings forth! Thus speaks he better of the past than present, Because the cold and calculating eye Pretends not to detect him by the absence Of those invisible images he draws! Thus Memory mingles up the actual, Impress'd upon the brain from outward shapes, With the creations woven in the loom That works within: and thus to the poet All past life is but as a shadowy vision, That which when present was but dull and hard, Or painful, is converted in the retrospect To bright, soft, mellow tints of exquisite Grandeur or gentleness, and fond attraction! There is excess of misery in the world, But there is also rapture, and sublimity, And minglement of pleasure, both material And spiritual, which defies all words! But Heaven's surrounding air must be as bland, And soft, and glowing, as the vernal sun Breaking through gold-ting'd clouds. The habitant Of low, dank, marshy plains, in atmospheres Heavy, oppressive, colourless, unchangeable, Feels his soul frozen, and without emotion! Pent in this mould of earth, we are not free From its effects on the immortal soul! Beneath dull skies dull labour may pursue Its useful course of body, or of intellect, But weak and cloudy will the gleams of spirit, And humble be! O! for Italian skies To ripen the rich products of the mind! Providence, in its goodness, has ordain'd That humble talents should be fit to work The common business of mankind's affairs; While Genius, like a fine-edg'd instrument, Is blunted by encount'ring hard materials. The task is others' deep to penetrate To distant motives—principles extract— Take a wide range beyond the circumstances That press upon particular interests, And to devise, and resolutions form For general, not mean individual good! Here Genius only can supply the requisite Power, light, acuteness, and profundity. The mighty insight of the exploring mind Throws rays that shine for ever!—not before Touch'd, and not touch'd again,—though it were easy To follow, where the path had once been open'd! Thus Daniell, moral poet, of intense, Most subtle, and most searching, and original Thought; yet of language clear—harmonious, Bright and elastic, strikes a thousand lights By the collisions of his vigorous mind! A plaintive melancholy sentiment Of human frailties mellows all the strains, And thrills the tender bosom with a virtuous And lovely sympathy! Oh! what a lesson Of intellectual wisdom—to be studied With close abstraction of sharp faculties, Are those wrought emanations of intensity! There will be met nice truths elicited, Not elsewhere found! and evanescent tints Of moral lights and shades, no other hand Has ever trac'd, or had perception of, If they had died with him! What head so dull Among the children of the Muse, to be Insensible how much had Intellect Lost of its gems! Oh! name of worth, yet now But little noticed, and still less regarded, Yet well repaid for all neglect of others By that great living Critic, whose pure praise Is fame itself,—the virtuous, eloquent, And all-accomplish'd Laureate! Sleep, then, excellent And sagest Daniell, tranquil in thy tomb: Thy name in golden letters is inscrib'd, Which never more a cloud or stain will know! But ever must the living Bard encounter The chills and blights which stupor, envy, malice, Intrigue, and rivalry, pour on his efforts! His zeal with them is but an eagerness To blow vain bubbles: they, forsooth, would have him Rest on his oars; and sleep, or play, or whistle, Seeking amusement which no labour costs, In lieu of toilsome products, nothing worth! But what is meditated with profound Pondering of all the mind's most chosen strength, Were all committed to the fading marks Of treacherous memory, in foolish faith, That if it vanishes 'twill come again! Bursts of the mind there are which come but once, And if not noted then, are lost for ever! Deluder vain! who thinks that what he once Has known, in future he shall ever know! Sometimes by accidental processes The brain arrives at truths that ne'er again Will shine upon it! In an happier mood, The hope of novelty has led him on, And never will that impulse strong return! There is a train which, when the light is caught, By its own course proceeds: arrest its course— Cut short the blaze, and all is dark for ever! Thus in the misty twilight of the brain, As if in love with darkness, man consumes His precious days, and to the dust descend His mouldering relics, black Oblivion's prey. Is there in discipline of Intellect Aught that can save us from the woes of life? No! but full much there is that greatly heightens Life's noblest pleasures! Cruel, false philosopher, That would'st attempt to cavil, and to argue Those charms away! for what imagination By magic spell creates, is best reality! Most bright—most unalloy'd by earthly evil! —Oh! talk not of delusive tints of error; Talk not of mischievous and quagmire lights! Truth in Imagination's golden vests With most enchantment shines! The poet's pen Embodies them, that, like the rainbow's hues And shapes, dart forth, change, flit, and fade away! But when we see the great ones of the world Ride over us in cars of burnish'd ore, Then does the Muse a shield afford, or covers us With mantles, proof 'gainst their insulting strains! Odious the arts by which the coarser talents Of bold ambition scale the heights of Fortune! 'Tis confidence in self, and readiness, Perception quick—not thought original— Which works its progress thro' the thorns and barriers! He who can catch the lights which others generate, Bears all the palm away from the creator; It costs him nought but memory; all the toil Is done for him, and his fresh unspent vigour Is ready for the skilful application. In Statesmen—Legislators—Governors, How rarely has that sole great gift been found, That marks Invention's mighty faculty! For here alone the glory lies: all else A mind of mediocrity, by industry, Art, accident, and cunning disciplined, May reach, while working for the public good Plausibly,—for itself alone in heart And truth! But honours, station, riches, thus, And luxuries, and the base world's applause, Are gain'd, enjoy'd, heap'd, spent, forgot, dissolv'd. Then what is birth? Does it exalt the soul, Give generous sentiments, heroic courage, And firm resolves? or does it lull to rest The energies of body and of mind? In animals, the character of blood Is ever valued: spirit, force, formation Of limbs, and nerves, and veins. In human nature, The qualities of head and heart, which Time Has seen descending through a long succession Of centuries, and bearing still the palm Amid the conflicts of society, Must still have something of inherent power To make them hold their place, and be preeminent. The origin of true nobility Is buried in the night of Time; it takes Its fountain from the earliest restoration Of laws and civil order, when the reign Of Charlemagne the beautiful gradation Of feudal structure through his empire cast; Who cannot from this ancient stock of Princes Derive their streams of heritable blood, Have not pretension to strict ancientry Of noble stock! Thus rare the genuine brood Of noble vein in England! One or two Of Saxon Princes sprung, complexly mingled With Norman chieftains, but from Normandy The Carlovingran Peerage plac'd its feet, And spread its broad black pinions o'er the land, From Dover's heights to Wallia's mountain bounds. Tuesday, 15th November. There Chester's Earl his vast domains extended, And left by heiresses a long succession Of mighty feudal Peers. The blood is dwindled, And now diluted into puny races! But once there was a living vigour in it, That roll'd through centuries in pride and glory. Now all is change, and no one knows his station, And institutions tremble to their base; Now dignity has lost its reverence, And none obey upon authority And reason, but by force; for every one Would make the law himself to regulate! Thus whom condition, birth, and destiny, Have made to be restrain'd, must be the rulers! Thus uproar soon will come, and anarchy, Plunder, and bloodshed: knowledge and the arts Will die, and one black ruin cover all! If tyranny and hard oppression move The bosoms of the great, let bold revenge Strike, and to ashes tumble down abuse Of human power! but let not upstart insolence, From fretful and delusive self-opinion, And morbid discontent, attack the lawful And necessary bonds of Government! Laws operate more by usage than by force, And therefore novelty of enactment is An ill intrinsic of the wisest laws! But not by laws alone a people live; Those gifts of nature, and those moral habits, Too nice for laws to regulate, inspire Content and happiness, which rods of rulers Can nor bestow, controul, nor take away! Indolence, and her squalid progeny, Mean reckless Want, or daring thirst of plunder, Sprung from th' excitement of the elements, Too feeble are, or too unmalleable, By legislative wisdom to be chang'd! But individual genius knows not country, Government, climate, manners: 'tis in all Nearly the same! The Bard in every nation— In every age—of similar elements His song composes;—ever are the sympathies Of the heart's sensibilities the same! The force and processes of mind will vary— Never the heart! Beneath the savage rule Of cruel despots, and in war, and blood, Or penury, and cold, and hunger, thus Has the Muse struck the undecaying lyre! Thus Spencer's rich and prodigal invention Put forth his brilliant stores of fabulous tales, 'Mid hordes barbarian raging round with fire And sword, and yells of fierce vindictive slaughter! Thus Sackville, when the scaffold and the stake Threaten'd all ranks, gave forth his Legend bold Of picturesque sublimity! And thus Chatterton sung, the cup of poison steaming E'en at his lips! He breath'd the notes of music To the last gasp, then clos'd his earthly sighs Within the soothing Muses' arms, and died! Rays from the stars descend to light the earth, And sometimes the frail human shape inhabit; Then tir'd, revolted, burst away again, And seek their native skies! Upon this globe To be cast destitute, devoid of food, Of raiment, and of roof, seems a strange fate For the all-bounteous rule of Providence! The fruits of earth would seem sufficient for The sustenance of human population, But by the toil of hands, and sweat of brow, It must be gain'd! And ere the harvest comes, Where are the funds the labour to sustain? The progeny of man reduplicates Upon the earth, and can alone by art And force of body generate its food. But slow it comes,—inadequate to meet Instant demand; and hence heart-torn dependence, And work at will of others, and the pay Of maintenance doled out. But hence the efforts Of human ingenuity—of science— Imagination; all that touches the senses, And all the beating echoes of the bosom! Hence capitals of states, cities and towns, Live by contrivance—good and evil mix'd— Industry virtuous; fraud, and perfidy, And trick, and foul extortion,—wretches live In multitudes upon the very vitals Of fellow-beings. Half of boasted London, Dense in its numberless inhabitants, Lives, fattens, gorges on the other half! Day after day, its means precarious Of dearly-bought existence, by expedients Of crime and cunning, are with pain procur'd. Jews, jobbers, gamblers, thieves, and usurers, And hell-scap'd myrmidons of tortur'd law. Thus as society becomes complex, And laws and schemes of human cunning grow, Vice swells, and ramifies, and turns to poison, Disease, and misery, the ways of life. And thus Corruption grows and lifts her head Gigantic, and her thousand arms abroad, Till with foul blood she mortifies, and down At once she sinks into the pit of death. The havoc of her gangren'd body throws Its ruin far and wide, and pestilence Infests the skies, and fertile lands become Unpeopled deserts, where the rank remains Of former habitations breed infection, And human footsteps can no longer tread. States have their rises and their falls; the height Attain'd, they rest not long upon that giddy summit, More rapidly descending than they rose again,— And, as they go, the horrible velocity Gains strength, and to the pit with thunder bounds, And, into atoms crush'd, awakes a noise, As if the elements had come together! So clouds o'er Europe gather, that predict A dread return of centuries of darkness; When all the sweet civilities of life Must cease, and rudeness, rapine, fall of temples, And palaces, and mansions, must lie spread In fragments on the desolated soil! Riches must cease, and poverty, without The aid of what it fed on, must grow poorer; And man, ferocious, lose the light of mind, And roam and grovel in the woods like brutes. Learning and genius, like all mortal gifts, Tend, through man's frailty, ever to abuse. Knowledge wide-spread, to ill-digested brains, Becomes delusion; ill-plac'd confidence In self-opinion generates fumes and mists, Inebriates the patient, and before him Puts forth false rays which lead to snares and ruin. Wisdom the child of tranquil Leisure is, And humble Contemplation,—not of hasty Passion, and narrow prospect of surrounding Events, and pressing interests of a few! But ever will the multitude believe What flatters their own habits, and their tastes Pampers; and thus, authority set loose, Lets all things quickly dash themselves to chaos. Each his own bounded ken is taught to trust, And think that what a partial ill creates Repugnant is to heavenly dispensation. Thus pitiful conceit believes it can New-make creation in a better form; Authors must now to popular taste devote Their pliant wits for sordid lucre's sake, And higher minds, too weak to stem the tide Of democratic clamour, first surrender The guidance, then in mere despondence bend Their own elastic talents to the storm And thus an universal dissolution Of reason sound, and deep philosophy, Insinuates itself through every rank, And every nation! Wisdom rules no more, Nor Genius, nor sound learning;—plausible Pretensions of the people's rights, and clamourous Demands of universal distribution, Of equal franchises, and equal judgment, Equal respect to each's own opinion, And nothing yielded to the force and weight Of talents by experience, age, and labour, Lifted above the common lot of intellect,— These are the rulers of the times; precursers Of fearful overturns, and rude distraction! But let not tyranny, and narrow thoughts Of partial favour, and vile privilege, Triumph at doctrines and remarks like these! There are abuses in old governments Which patience can no longer suffer! Faith In principles of optimists is folly, And mean subjection to such power is criminal; Idolatry of wealth or rank is vile— Pusillanimity of head and heart! In upstart greatness, there's a ruling passion To ride upon the backs of the companions Whom once it knew in its debased state, And insult, with unjust success, combines To fix respect and awe by marks of power. The tranquil conscience of hereditary Title to seats of grave preeminence Resorts not to excitement, or the tone Of insolent authority, and threats. But waters in commotion, when the mud Is upward stirr'd, and what should float at top Is sunk by the disturbance, spread disorder Over the banks, throwing effluvia forth, Whence dangerous maladies distain the air: Oft, in the lapse of time, the chaiu that galls Is left when the necessity has ceas'd. Oh, bigotry, how hateful is thy reign! Oh, prurient love of change, how full of ills Untired, unseen, is thy presumptious passion! Rash blindness! fanciful belief in prospects, Which only in the fancy's mirror shine! To hope for better lights, and sound improvements, But hope with caution, and long meditation; And to suspect the seeming good which others Of deeper wisdom in past ages miss'd. Wednesday, 16th November. 'Tis pleaded that the course of public state, If it goes ill, regards not private men! But all the small concerns of private life Ill legislation deeply trenches on. Do wanton and unskilful taxes take Nothing of comfort from pinch'd poverty? Laws of miscall'd protection to the person, And purse, but add a weapon to the strong, And aggravate the weakness of the weak! Is justice only to be had for gold? Then he who most completely robs his victim Acts with impunity, and is most secure! Better no laws than such as these, too complex For use of those who most a shield require. Error, caprice, uncertainty is bad, From instant judgment of frail, thoughtless men, But chance of rectitude is also there; And thus the humble, as the high, may find Some hope, some possible relief and comfort. Now villainy triumphant reigns, and fraud Is furnish'd with the surest means to cover it. When Courts are arguing knotty points of meaning, Consuming days and nights in useless subtleties, It nought avails to anxious litigants,— Neither can gain the prize—the ravenous lawyer Takes all! and thus the intricate web is wove, Victims to catch, and death is in its nets. The wind blows fierce and cold, and hollow shrieks Ride on the night-storm! Down the swelling Rhone Come the careering blasts! A sable mantle Invests the skies, and loud the rage is heard, But nought is seen: rock'd in my bed I lie, And in the tumult fuller flows my Muse. The night is as the day to me,—no time Of my declining years for work I lose! The midnight hours speed quick while at my task, And in sleep's torpor little is consumed. Perchance by perseverance, self-denial, And firm reliance on the mind's omnipotence, This clog of earthly clay may be cast off, And we may to pure intellect and spirit Convert ourselves, and live on air, and drink Etherial springs! and then the film will fall, And we celestial objects shall behold! Now human cares and sorrows, and the blight Of dire adversity, suppress our fires. The glow of human charity no more Shines on misfortune; black neglect, reproach, Calumny, insult, single or in groups, Assail their victim with conflicting weapons. How often to the grave I look for peace, Finding no mercy in the human heart! The prosperous may talk of smiles and joys, And sympathies, and friendships, and applauses; Only where they are useless are they lavish'd. Oh, wretched human fate! 'tis Vice that walks The world in worship, honour, pride, and smiles. Minds dull and ignorant, yet full of faith In their own petty faculties and knowledge, Assume the reins and rule the course of kingdoms. Then narrow and distorted measures come, Concession, where resistance bold is fit, And obstinate resistance, where to yield Alone can save a kingdom from convulsion: Thus foul corruption, when to purify Is the grand boast on which they place their claims! Genius, without intrigue, ne'er wins its way Up the steep, slippery scale of public station; Secret manœuvre, bribery, mutual pledge Of wicked counter-payments, treacherous promises, Each to give up a victim-friend, or foe; Impregnable concealment of intention, Smiles where revenge is plotted, surly frowns Outwardly on the hooded tool of ill— The hidden agent of the frowner's mischief. Plain-dealing, steps direct, and open heart, Are caught at every pace by ambush'd Wrong! He who looks back upon the precipices He has escap'd, in working up his way To worldly honours, trembles at the sight, And would not pass again the same deep dangers For all that man and life's first prize can give. Care, restless watchfulness, and sting of conscience, And pining, pale, and palsy-struck regret; Suspicion, troubled sleep, and sickly thought, And dread of solitude, and daggers hung By slender threads over the beating brain. But who can find the road to happiness In this mysterious globe, where Misery Rules paramount o'er ev'ry joy and blessing? Vice is successful, but not therefore happy; Virtue is wretched, for 'tis robb'd, tormented, Malign'd, and vultures live upon its blood: Genius can find no audience, and the mountebank Engrosses public favour—profit—praise. The people hear not aught that does not echo Their own opinions, feelings, arguments: If Genius is successful, 'tis by accident, And comes not from her merit, but her fate. Is there an art by which we can escape From damps of hope, and chills of spiritual pleasure? By the hard world th' attempt is stigmatiz'd; 'Tis call'd delusion, weakness, folly, crime. Still in the battle's front—the hope forlorn— Malice and envy ever place our lot! Angels in clouds descend, and Spirits walk In vest etherial cloath'd,—but these would pierce The veil, and all the bareness of mortality Expose. But who the shadows of delusion Would use, in momentary dreams to fly From danger and oppression, when the blow That pierces through the misty covering, Will heavier come at last? Oh! not more heavy, But soften'd by the magic of the mind, Whose genuine movements emanate from Truth. Thursday, 17th November. Each hour that we by virtuous means delay The misery that human fate imposes, Is a clear gain which wisdom sanctifies. The curse of Malice often on the good Hangs like a vulture, not to be shook off! But the good persecuted man holds on His course amid the tempest, sad at heart, Yet not in courage or in vigour quail'd. Who bears a lamp along the darkling road, Which, though it keeps not perils from himself, Throws rays at distance which direct the world, Is a blest pole-star, whose benign appearance Shall live in memory when its light is set. Spirits are sent on earth for good to man Who for themselves incur incessant evil, And are by those pursued for whom they toil. They love the inward conscience of the worth By which they merit glory, when they lose it. Dark is their brow and suff'ring pale thin cheek, And Care her wrinkles deep upon it ploughs; Feebly the feet the body bears along, And every limb and nerve with sorrow trembles. But still they live, and though, without, all clouds And massy darkness, in the sanctuary Of the soul's temple burns the purest brightness. The wind, that to repose had hush'd itself, Again begins to mutter. Arno's white wave And Rhone's blue tumbling billow greet each other Across the istmus, as they near approach Into each others' arms to throw themselves! Blasts, lightly shrieking, ride again upon The ruffled summits of their surfaces; And cars with rumbling wheels seem rapidly To roll upon them. Tones of th' elements Are to the poet music rapturous: In the still midnight ever Nature's sounds Speak as oracular voices,—then the Muse Within her glowing arms embraces us, And we lie bath'd in bliss most exquisite. Then only her dear sister, Contemplation, Sits by our sides, and consecrates our slumbers. Encircled in the hooded veil, she whispers Lullabies; and the spirit from deep slumbers Hears, and is sooth'd the more, and sleeps again! Who are th' interpreters of airy visions Like these? The dreamer is too lost in rapture, And all the notes are airy and inaudible To others, and the shapes are light and flitting. But sometimes when the dream has pass'd away, The memory still retains it on the fancy;— Thus fancy renovates what rich creation Invents; for fancy merely is a mirror, And has no faculty which recombines. Let dust to dust return, and take the fate Of its materials of mortality: The soul within has died from its corruption. If man to crawl with worms is well content, And live upon the foulness of the earth, The fate of earth he must endure, and never Ascend the skies! and then his brother worm Will eat the lifeless carcase, and no Spirit Hover to call back the etherial particle! Milton has said, that man imbrutes by sensual Sin; and the joy of mere material pleasure Is full of disappointment and regret. Satan rules o'er the world, and in the shape Of the sly serpent ever tempts to ill: Disguise, and treachery, and hypocrisy, Are the chief crimes that desolate the world,— Then fraud, extortion, plunder. Purge foul London Of nineteen-twentieths of its habitants, And there will be enough to govern well! But multitudes conceal the hell-like practices Of rapine, theft, and juggle, blood, and torture. How live the crowds that round the carrion flock Of the vile Public Funds? By daily lies, For fraud and robbery alone invented! There solitude, amid innumerable And dense collections of unknown and nameless Masses of men, o'ercomes the drooping spirit, And, with a fearful dread of rude oppression, Makes the heart sink itself to mean abasement. How different is the solitude of woods, And vallies, and green meadows, and soft rills! There tranquil self-complacence may revive, And fond Imagination may conform, All which surrounds it to its own delight. There native love and purity of bosom Has leisure to be good, and to dispense Light from the rays within upon the scene, When the wind breathes the music of the skies. Here only can the Muse her heavenly fire Nurse, and the mind forget its earthly bonds, And spiritual Virtue spread her glittering wings! There is no joy but in deep solitude,— When by the world to be forgotten, little Imports us if we that base world forget! Give me but books and a smooth-running pen, And bread and water and a roof of straw Suffice for me upon the lonely mountain, Where I may see the blessed sun arise And set again, and from a trackless distance See towers and cities glitter, but not hear The sounds discordant of their clamourous strifes! I would that I had thus a life whose troubles Have darken'd every moment pass'd away; I was not fitted for the frays of man, Contending ever with his jealous neighbour. Friday, 18th November. But I must end this fitful song, or come, At least, to a pause; and how can I have strength To raise my voice, or drive the current on? Woes cluster on my hoary head anew, And I am call'd this head to prostrate low, E'en to the wildest fury of the storm: It seems a crime to listen to the Muse, And by her magic voice to lull my torments! But still I throw me in her shielding arms, And in her voice's sweet forgetfulness Am sooth'd again by night to airy dreams. The day too troublous is, and mortal noises Drown all the notes of her seraphic tongue; But midnight stillness tempts her forth again, And on the solemn murmer of the breeze Her heavenly strain comes floating,—then again Of empyrean air I draw the freshness, And cast away the load of human sorrow. Thou whom these melancholy strains displease, Avert thy world-besotted ears, and spit The hateful scorn of thy obdurate heart: If thou art fond of gorgeous imagery, Or fairy fiction, here thou wilt not find it. The texture of the web is grave and moral, Scorning all ornament; the lessons stern, But not the less by sweet emotions soften'd Of sympathy for man's afflicted fate. 20 minutes before 1, A.M.</field>
