      <field name="fulltext">VOL. I. THE ENGLISH ORATOR. BOOK THE FIRST. In Fancy's day-dream, over classic ground Oft have I wander'd, where, of old, the sons Of patriot freedom, with extatic bliss Imbib'd, fair Eloquence! thy sweetest tones, And prov'd thy voice was virtue's. From the scenes Ennobled by thy worth, as I with-drew My ardent gaze to Albion, I have mourn'd Thy slighted honors in my native Isle; And fondly judg'd it no ungenial spot For thy sublime exertions, would the race Of Britons, thine auspicious aid implore. Spirit of Athens, o'er my Albion breathe The charms of genuine oratory! Here, Here only, flourish those protecting laws, In which the freeborn triumph! Here alone The senate in that threefold power exists Once deem'd chimerical! Religion, here, Sheds her pure beams! Hence Eloquence may soar To heights, which Rome or Athens never knew. Since, then, the temporal good of man requires The skill of the forensic tribes; and claims From legislative wisdom, the rever'd, The guardian voice; since higher interests ask The preacher's warning; come, Preceptive muse, And teach, how varied language may affect The listening audience with persuasion's force; Where, eloquent in law, the bar displays Its council; where the senate boasts its chiefs, Nobles or delegates; and where, devote To heaven, the pulpit animates its sons! Proceed, my song: And thou, ingenuous youth, To whom thy native talents point the path Which TULLY trac'd, attend!—for vain the toil Unblest by Nature. What tho' he, whose voice Shook PHILIP's throne, had power to brace the nerve Of faultering speech, as to the dashing waves With harsh and painful utterance he declaim'd; Yet in his first wild efforts shone the flame Of genius, heaven-inspir'd. With kindred powers Endued, (perhaps inferior) mock not those Who hold, that classic science best improves The mental vigor. For, unless thou meet The eye of wisdom 'midst her olive shade Where PLATO rov'd; or view the trophied fields A LIVY painted; or, in fancy, feel Elysian raptures, such as MARO sung; Ah! vainly wilt thou boast that polish'd taste— That knowlege, which, effusing light and warmth, Charms and invigorates the soul intent On high pursuits, ambitious to command Applause, and eager to bid myriads hang In mute suspension, on attractive sound. Nor, vers'd in classic volumes, may'st thou scorn The geometric symbol, fittest found To rein careering fancy, and the mind, Tho' wavering, fix to its important aims. Meanwhile, my British pupil, Albion's tongue Merits thy study; whether, at its roots Saxon or Celtic, thou commence thy search, Or mark its Roman offspring, or observe Its manly force and copiousness, that seem To rival energetic Greece; tho' oft The hissing syllables and uncouth sounds Its barbarous origin to memory call. Thus with preparatory knowlege stor'd, Thy favorite object vig'rously pursue Thro' regions, where the masters of thy art Nurture the shoots of blooming genius. There, The first in critic wisdom shall repress Each scion's wild exuberance, and prune Its richly-vegetative growth: tho' harsh His frowning features, yet, awhile, restrain Within the limits of his hallow'd walks Thy footsteps; ere thy far-excursive mind Wing'd from the portico to distant scenes, Amidst the turrets of Palmyra, pant To meet her daring critic, and admire His animated form! I see—I see His fervid soul exulting, as he fires With all the blaze of coloring, at a stroke, Each image that a rhetor would express With cold deliberate pencil, less obscure. But, not impatient of restraint, still yield Thy genius to the rhetor's forming hand, Submissive: and, if fair Lyceum's shade Hath long detain'd thy steps, go, turn thy view To where the bowers of Tusculum receive Their liberal father, from a world's applause Retiring oft, to taste the placid joy Of philosophic silence. O revere That spot, where many a salutary rule Of oratorial wisdom, from his pen Flow'd in clear sense and harmony of style; Whose more diffusive elegance shall gain Thy pleas'd attention; and refresh thy mind Strengthen'd by argument, and vers'd in laws Of rigid definition. Nor in vain Shall he, of later age, whose science strove To raise the drooping art, while pallid Rome Cursd her last CÆSAR, claim thy listening ear Full oft, as studious fancy points the way, Enter his school with reverence, and attend His fluent lecture, rising from the source Of genuine sense—the fountain of thy art. For deem not these are arbitrary laws Of vanity, self-plum'd: 'twas Nature's self Bade them from truth and oratory rise! To artifical rules, by critics drawn, Long pre-existent, eloquence o'erwhelm'd With rapid force the million!—Yet the few, Whose judgment with a calm undazzled eye Could note the impetuous energies, resolv'd Its various form, and trac'd its secret springs Dispelling wide the obscurity, that veil'd Its origin, erewhile but dimly seen! Hence, then, the laws to govern all, but those Whom liberal nature bids disdain controul, Pre-eminent in genius. Now, more free, From rules to models thy attention turn— Mirrors of imitation! Now releas'd From frigid rhetors, catch the sacred fire Of the bright orator, that, rising, steals With gradual inspiration, thro' the frame! Mark, how he throws with graceful air, the veil Of modesty, o'er merits he disclaims With all the diffidence of eyes afraid To meet the favouring audience! Mark, how clear, Concise and unadorn'd the simple facts He states with seeming artlessness! And, see, In subtleties of logic how he weaves The various texture! Mark, how strong, he rolls Sudden, his awful eloquence; or winds, How smooth, the soft insinuating stream! And, lo, the passions his dominion own In many a quick emotion, while they dart Electric thro' the crowd, that rous'd, impell'd, Feel, as he feels; and practice, as he wills! Thus, while the proud democracy of Greece Foster'd the flame of liberty; her tribe Of heroes and of legislators, flush'd With glory, felt the oratorial strain Inspire their breasts! Then each emotion throbb'd Decisive of his patriot worth, who breath'd In manly phrase that energy of truth— That greatness which o'ershoots all vulgar aim! Thus thro' the forum the contagion ran Where TULLY spoke, who, as each heart disclos'd Strait at his bidding all its secret views And sentiments and passions, could address Its various feelings; soothe its cares; and seem, Tho' every thought he moulded at his will, To echo but opinions freely-form'd, And voluntary wishes!—while he past In rich diffusion, from the simple strain To figurative beauties; from the flash Of sportive wit, to bosom-thrilling tales Of pathos; master of the melting soul! Not so the Speakers of our isle command Their auditors; tho' some may justly claim, Young Orator, thine imitative toil; Whether thy ripening genius would explain, Or frame, the laws, and guard the fleeting forms Of property; or open, by the keys Of evangelic writ, the gates of heaven! Whate'er thy destin'd province, note the modes Of those who, long conspicuous there, adorn Solidity of matter, with the grace Of unaffected eloquence; who, pleas'd By no adulterate colors, would disdain The florid decoration: thither turn Attentive, and observe their beauteous dress Of thought; yet dare not imitate, ere vers'd In law's abstruser volume, or the tome Of sacred wisdom. Rather pause, awhile, Amid the rich materials that may yield Thy memory stores of knowlege, to assist Thy future action: hence the willing words In just expression never cease to flow, And luminously paint the living thought! Instructed in variety of rules And perfect models, see thy gradual art Developing her end, persuasion, points Thy ceaseless studies, to her object, man. Fix, therefore, on the ways of man, thine eye; While, at thy voice, philosophy undraws The mystic curtain, that from vulgar sight Conceals the springs of action; and explore The cause of every visible effect Which strikes the sense, in all the varying modes Of countenance or mien. The internal mind Unveil'd, pursue it thro' its outward forms; Studious to catch the Proteus, as it shifts In wild variety. But, lest thy search Obscur'd by complicated views, in vain Essay from genuine nature to detach Those adventitious qualities, produc'd By fashion or by art,—go seek the scenes Of barb'rous life: survey the uncultur'd breast How simple in its energies—how pure From artificial tincture! See yon chief Beneath his plantain-canopy of shade, (The hoary father of his Indian tribe) In attitude to speak! And hark—his voice, Rude Orator! awards in solemn tones The fearful sentence; or announces, urg'd By social spirit, the decrees of law; And now, in milder strain, of other days Recounts traditionary tales, well vers'd In oral lore; or points, while nature glows Thro' all his artless gestures, to the hills Whose horizontal azure skreens his heaven! Meantime the untutor'd hearers, with rude signs Not inexpressive of the moral sense Stamp'd on each heart—of fancy tho' enclos'd By narrow boundaries—of the affections, wild In native force; the veteran chieftain hail Their judge, their legislator, father, friend. And yet, within a space how small, comprest His various office lies! For few the wants, Desires, pursuits of life, where nature reigns Sole arbitress! External objects there Of good and evil, thinly-scatter'd, give Few images to sense; while judgment views The ideas faintly; or young fancy forms The blissful or the heart-appalling dream; Or, in alternate hues, the passions throw The light and shade of pleasure and of pain, Harsh and unblended, o'er the barb'rous breast; Whose every vehement emotion speaks The impulses of love, hope, hatred, fear, As savage nature dictates, unrestrain'd. While, thus, the rising image of thy art Cöeval with the social spirit, dawns On the rude mind, whose inward motions strike The sense, in forms unvaried, undisguis'd— Lo, where refinement spreads, in mingled hues, Her varnish o'er the character, and opes, Amidst her world of manners, the warm source Of nicer feelings! Hence unfolding, start Such objects into life, as oft defy Intractable, the whole collected powers Of eloquence. The self-complacent air As conscious of equality; the eye Of critic sapience glanc'd, superior, down; The coldness, that contemns the richer vein Of glowing thought; the speculative views Of reason, too refin'd; the sceptic's doubt Perplexing truth; and each illusive art Of specious casuistry, “whose melting tongue, While all is false and hollow,” soothes the ear; And penetration's insight that detects The Orator's design, tho' deeply plann'd; And interest's venal offspring; and the race Of prejudice; and all the lurking spawn Of dark suspicion—these full oft prevail And “dash maturest counsels.” Nor, meantime, Doth fancy, vitiated and vain, applaud Pure unobtrusive elegance, or feel Simplicity's attractions; and a taste Too delicately-sensitive, shrinks back From spots invisible to common eyes! Here, too, the affections spring from fashion's mould, How chang'd their features! the constraint, that checks The fervor of expression nature loves, And smothers feeling; the deceitful front Whose eye-brow shews emotions which the heart Disclaims; and all the variegated train Of passions in assemblage; such are seen In polish'd life, requiring the controul Of energetic genius, that alone Raises to high pre-eminence thy art. Yet, who, while such a meed awaits his toil, Would fly to shades inglorious; idly there To waste his talents in the lap of ease? Who, while so great the triumph, would forego Powers, that might crush corruption; or exalt The passions into dignity and worth! Turning from general picture, where appears The savage haunt or soften'd scene; observe, How meliorated life o'er Albion's isle Streams its peculiar colors;—fond to trace Amid these shores, the wonders of thy art, That fires the frigid genius of the north With quick enlivening spirit; can correct With lenient charm its irritable nerve; On inborn valor stamp the sterling worth Of noble sentiment; repress the hopes And fears of fond credulity; improve To charity divine the generous bent Of British tempers; and expand the love Of freedom, more than patriot, into views Of universal liberty! Tho' rare Effects so splendid, yet the impanell'd train, The conscript worthies, and the mingled race That catch the sacred oracles, have own'd Such wonders; while their Orator's keen eye Search'd, thro' each scene, the little world of man. And, now, contract thy survey, and approach The varied manners, as they mark the bar, The senate, and the fane; and see, from each Distinct, the essentials of the oration rise. If, then, within the precincts of the bar, Intelligence display the simpler lines Of reas'ning in the Jury, as, intent On points of property or life that teem With various facts, and studious to collect Unvarnish'd proof, they trace the maze of law; Here, o'er the mental powers the judgment rules, In all the sober gravity of thought. If, too, the senate's dome its gates unbar, And, opening wide its glories, bid the view Refinement o'er its elevated sons Effuse its brilliant polish, and illume The mind, that orders the domestic cares Of Albion—that deliberately weighs The fate of empires—that adjusts the scale Of universal politics; here smiles The lively taste! In friendly concord here, With judgment, glow the imaginative powers! And, if the vault of gothic gloom o'erarch, In pillar'd majesty, a mingled crowd Imprest with characters of various teint, But, chief, the features of the unletter'd mind; Who, tho' unform'd to reason, or discern Truth's star-crown'd summit, or pursue the paths Of speculative faith, or taste the charms Of elegance (howe'er their preacher shine In oratorial gracefulness) yet feel The light'ning flash—the vehemence of thought— Yet feel religion's fervors—feel their hopes— Their fears all trembling, as his voice displays Her menaces and blessings; here, 'tis here, Passion, the soul of oratory, reigns! Since, therefore, evident distinctions mark These varying provinces, thy threefold art Bids its discriminated sons inform The judgment, or delight the keener sense Of fancy and of taste, or move the springs Of passion: hence, to each appropriate, flows Perspicuous argument; fair ornament; Or pathos, energetic every tone! Yet, as unaided logic, tho' it link Its truths in strictest series, but appears Inanimate and mean; as every show Of elegance, undignified by sense, Is but the specious harlotry that shines To catch, with transitory glare, the sight; And, as impassion'd accents, that convey An indistinctive imag'ry untried By reason, perish like the cymbal's sound; Still must each orator, with just degrees Adapted to his proper sphere, unite Those grand essentials, in one perfect whole! HASTE, then, my liberal pupil, to unfold, In full display, the essentials; thro' the means Of sentiment, invented and arrang'd; Of language modulated and adorn'd; And of the voice, the looks, the gesture, wak'd To high impulsive fervors! Here appears Invention—with the shadowy tribes of mind Innumerous! Here, arrangement gives them form; And elocution, grace; and action, fire! O come, wherever thou hast fix'd thine aims, While knowlege bids thee, with an eagle eye (The master of thy subject) pierce thro' all Its just divisions, whose assemblage springs Created at a glance—in transport feel The lively vigor of invention pour, As if spontaneous, to thine aid, the stores Of sentiment, in varying weight and force Supported, as the oration's topic tends; In varying aspect model'd, as its parts Incipient, or in mediate order, flow; Or, closing, constitute a finish'd whole! And, strait, arrangement, rising at thy call, Distributes every sentiment, that sprung Rich from invention. Hence, concise and clear, Proceeds the exordium: hence narration links Perspicuous action, in unbroken chain: Hence, confirmation gives its argument To prove each proposition; and repel, By refutation's power, the casuist's pleas; Whether, as issuing from the internal fount Of independent reason, or, deduc'd From high authority's extrinsic source, It borrow plain induction's form; or gain, In shape of enthymeme, the assenting soul: And, hence, the thoughts that in diffusion flow'd, Amid the peroration re-appear In one full view. Thus oft the judgment yields Convinc'd, to oratory's artless sway. But, tho' man's judging faculty may feel Conviction's deep impression, thro' the force Of argument, in simpler dress; behold, Thy animated art here scorns to rest— Ambitious of effects beyond the reach Of cold conviction, to whose guidance bends The judgment only, that, too oft o'erborne By fancy or the passions, owns the truth, Yet sleeps inactive. No—she rests not here— Impatient to disclose the means to touch The imaginative sense, and please the taste. See, while arrangement regulates the thought Invention furnish'd; elocution hastes To decorate the language with the charm Of periods flowing into rhythm, and give The embellish'd grace that rises from the source Of figures and of tropes—the richest fund Of oratorial beauty! To the scenes Of classic fame, already, generous youth! Thy mind recurs; where harmony divine, With every sweet variety of tone, To heavenly rapture sooth'd the Grecian ear; Where DIONYSIUS or DEMETRIUS taught— And smooth ISOCRATES display'd the power Of modulated cadence! There alone Thy art was music! Nor enamour'd Rome Was idly charm'd by TULLY's tuneful strain, While, as she listen'd, from his tongue she caught A softer language, tho' inferior far To the sonorous melodies of Greece! If, then, thy art require thee to convey Its polish'd numbers thro' the finer ear To fancy's seat;—to chuse appropriate words, And place them in meet order, be thy care; Such as, of smoother, and of liquid sounds, Glide in soft lapse—that, duly cull'd to round The period, and distributed aright Thro' all its members, musically rest At every pause, proportionately-true, And fill with dignity the swelling close! Yet, vain each effort, should thine ear, too dull To feel the varying tones, disown the force Of musical construction—vain thy toil To suit the expressive cadence to the parts The oration opens. But the curious choice, And apt diffusion of melodious sound, Govern'd by thy percipient ear, create That harmony of words, “the numerous style.” And now, more ardent, elocution pours O'er the smooth language, that embellish'd grace Which glows amidst variety of tropes— Which lives in figures! Fancy paints their hues— For they are fancy's offspring! Yet are those Her more peculiar race, whose power transfers Words newly-plac'd, from their first simple sense To import, that, analogously-just Diversifies the style, and throws fresh light On each conception. Thus the trope displays The mind's abstracted images transform'd To sensible ideas, and relieves Bold as the magic of the clear-obscure Their heighten'd shapes; while, richest of the train, And suited to the subject it adorns, Drawn from a bright and obvious source, yet free From every mean allusion, unobscur'd By wild incongruous mixture, nor pursued Too far, the metaphor its lusture spreads, Itself a picture!—Passing hence, the mind Expatiates, where fair allegory robes, Amid her rich creation, every form With visionary vesture! But beware Of charms, that, ill-adapted to the strain Of graver eloquence, might best inspire The poet's day-dream! There may fancy sport On wanton wing—yet o'er thy chaster theme She scatters all her graces; and to tropes Adds the strong figures, that contrast, compare, Heighten by just degrees the rising thought, Address the dead, or animate still life With sense and motion, or that paint the past Distinct before our eyes! Hence language blends (To modulation's sweetest tone refin'd) In concert with the numerous, every charm Of figurative style. Thus taught the means Of ornament, be sedulous to fix Its due degrees, as suited to thy sphere, Thy subject, and thine audience, and the parts Congenial with its essence; bid it steal From nature all her negligence of air; Give it to please the fancy and the taste, And with persuasive music win the soul! And yet, tho' more seducing than the sounds Whose silver sweetness soothes the zephyr, flow Those strains of elegance and rhythm, thy art Hurries their melting harmony away, To where, in all its fervors, passion rolls Its torrent stream—to agitate—impel And whelm the ravish'd audience! Every grace Which softest elocution had effus'd— (The numerous and the figurative) breathes New life, as animation's kindling light Shoots thro' the bloom of beauty! And behold Action, with sudden energy, calls forth, Bursting upon the scene, its powers of voice, Of countenance and gestures, to transfuse The soul of pathos, thro' the oration, rich With amplifying swell! The emphatic stress, The awakening pauses, and pathetic tones, That mark the speaker's various voice, demand Thy unrelax'd attention. If he feel The spirit of the sentiment that springs From nature and conviction; if he speak With unaffected efforts to persuade, Fir'd by the passions, by the truth he strives To impress upon his audience; (from himself, From his own soul transmitted into theirs) Know, all his emphases precisely fall On each full word, that gives the proper strength To changeful sentiment; know, every pause Dwells at distinctive intervals, to point The lucid sense; or, riveting the mind To ought of deeper moment rests awhile Solemnly still; or in suspense retains The trembling expectation it arous'd Prelusive: and, assur'd that all his tones Echoing variety of passion, note The figures each created; go—nor blush To emulate a voice whose compass holds Music's whole melodies! Go—steal his looks, His gestures, in their every varying mode, In all their fine transitions, from the calm To vehement expression; while thy frame, Strung to spontaneous unison, accords Responsive, to his feelings! Such the force Of sympathy, transfus'd into a heart, Unconscious of the visible effect That imitation's ductile power displays, At NATURE's bidding. Yet must she avoid Those habits of peculiar cast, that, long Adhesive to her form, too oft betray Strange quaintness; and, unmeaningly-combin'd With passion's air, obtrude upon its warmth Amid its brightest fervors. Hence, correct The unseemly gesture, not misdeem'd the bane To pathos, in its eloquent career! Thus, while a spirit and a manner, caught From perfect models, into nature's ease, Assimilating, flow; be thine to suit The powers of action to the oration's parts: Whether the exordium bid thy low-key'd voice Accordant with the tremulous air and eye O'eraw'd of downcast modesty, deserve The praise a CRASSUS ev'n from TULLY gain'd Of unassuming merit; or more calm Narration lead thy steady tones to meet A gesture gradually-compos'd and free, A dignity of attitude, and looks Of manly candor, and that open brow Where beams the lov'd sincerity of truth Anticipating proof. If, here, thou give In living portraiture, the past event Full to the sense; the comment of a glance, And motions fraught with meaning, and a voice More rais'd, express the vision of the scene. Still varying, confirmation would adapt To all the stronger cadences of sound, Its nervous proofs; while, consonantly-grave, The speaker's firm demeanor, and his air Of self-collected wisdom, ev'n imprint Conviction on his audience. As he reads Decision in their quick assent, he shews, Oft by a more majestic port, assum'd Insensibly, the triumph he foresees. Then comes the impersonated form; and bold The climax, heightening the progressive force Of action, in its native strength ascends! But if the Peroration, more inspir'd, In the full energy of pathos rise— Say, can poetic pencil trace the modes Of action, spreading o'er the enthusiast's frame; While the soul rushes thro' the vivid eye; And while in every motion it appears Irradiating the gestures; and, as charm Of wizard spell, the wonders of thy voice Strike deep persuasion? Then—tis then alone, The penetrating mind enkindled sees Its object cloath'd in greatness; and conceives In all the bold felicity of thought, The high design; and raises its whole powers To a proud height of glory not their own! 'Tis then the genius of thy art descends In rapid light; and, waving o'er the crowd Its magic effluence, darts thro' ev'ry breast, Or hatred, as abhorrent of the form, The averted action loaths; or anger, caught From the fir'd eye, and agitated air; Or fear's blank wildness! 'Tis at such an hour, That quiver ev'n a CÆSAR's pallid lips In terror, and his palsied hand lets drop Its papers, vainly-grasping; while the tones Of TULLY's voice unman the intrepid soul, That, 'midst the shock of armies, cou'd command Destruction drench'd in carnage! Then alone— Then many a passion hovers o'er the fate Of patriots,—such as tremble in thy traits, Great artist, where, in all the mellow light Of glory and of years, a CHATHAM falls; Still strenuous with his dying voice to save His Albion's fame, and eloquent in death! Lo! through the senate glides the pale alarm In each gradation of distress—the muse Would feebly copy from the melting teints The pencil breathes; tho' emulous to draw Thy shade of filial anguish from the groupe, Ingenuous YOUTH, as sinks the expiring flame Of patriot spirit that, erelong, shall burn Reviv'd in thee! O destin'd soon to rise With eloquence surpassing ev'n thy sire's, The saviour of thy country; while no more The venal hydra fronts thy manly strain, Thy dignity of aspect, and dismay'd The host of democratic faction flies! Meanwhile, can heaven-taught inspire The gentler tones of gratitude; or raise The sweet, the smiling aspect of esteem, In every face; as delicately-touch'd Thy portrait, meek benevolence, appears; Or, public virtue, thine! Nor steals in vain The soft infection thro' the feeling crowd, When all the sympathizing action pleads For the poor captive, who in dreary gloom Pines life away—full many a lingering year Shut from the light of heaven! There no cool breeze Refreshes the faint air; nor evening-ray Gilds his pale cell! Yet pity crowns the strain, The lusture of her cherub eye suffus'd With tears! Yet hope o'er all thy audience breathes (As if the chain of misery were their own) Ambrosial balms; and bids the lovely scene Of liberty and life, expanding, hail! And, often, have the assembled tribes confest Effects more animating, when, in aid Of oratorial talents, is unveil'd The speaker's own peculiar fate, that falls In nature's tone, and heighten'd by the force Of corresponding objects, on the sense; In each fine attitude and air, to strike The mingling chords of passion! Such the strings Where quick vibration ran thro' every note; When, erst (her kingdom tottering) when, pursu'd By hostile powers, the fair THERESA fled Amidst the Hungarian council; and display'd (With all the eloquence of youthful charms Touch'd by distress) her infant, of her griefs Unconscious, yet more eloquent than all! 'Twas then, the affections, blending as they rose, Rush'd forth! Then pity throbb'd in every breast— And love, dissolving at the sparkling glow Of beauty's tears—and reverence for the form Of royalty—(its hallow'd purple rent Thus rudely) and fierce anger at her foes; While, drawn aloft to vengeance, in one blaze The lightning of their fabres flash'd around! And, “Let us die”—(unanimous they cried)— “For our THERESA!” Triumph open throws The sounding portals; as persuasion's voice The hostile spirit rousing, bids it seize The plumed casque; and blow the trump of war! But not restrain'd (tho' high the power) to raise The affections, either in their simple shape Or variously-combin'd; thy art aspires To quench the emotions of the soul—to calm The turbulence of passion. Many a tale Of old, will give to thee the million's rage Charm'd into peace! Thy necromantic wand Arrests the madness of the monster-crowd; And lo, as lightning-struck, sedition dies. And, still, thy art, more potent, (as allay'd The tumult sinks) can breathe into the soul Affections that contrast their hues with those It erst subdued; turn sorrow to delight, Perplexity to confidence; and soothe Ev'n vengeance into mercy, while it steals The ruthless dagger from the despot's grasp! Yet, as the christian orator unfolds The radiance of sublimer views to point Aspiring faith, and (kindling in the soul The sacred passions) banish earth-born care; See, where a RAPHAEL paints the uplifted hand And attitude, alluring to the skies— See, in the Athenian multitude, the race Of prejudices, vanity, disdain, And sceptic wisdom fly! And lo, a band With cinctures floating in heav'n's light, appears— Humility; fair hope, that gilds the scene Of paradise in prospect; holy joy; And admiration fix'd in eager gaze; While every pagan from the death of sin Wakes to new life, and hails the Christian God! Such are the effects of action, in the fields Of oratorial fame! And such the powers (Pure or from foreign or theatric air) Which nature gives her children; whilst a look, A tone, can oft transfix the conscious heart. But if the force of sentiment arrang'd In beauteous order, and of language drest In elegant attire, with those combine; 'Tis then, exalted oratory sways, Wrought to its perfect form, the willing world! Thus, then, the essentials hath the muse unveil'd Perceptive:—Studious thou, meanwhile, to trace Their union and their order, as thy sphere And genius of the just oration wills; Except where versatile occasion's turn, Or sudden impulse of thy audience points A devious course. For oft, their due degrees Abandon'd, one essential ev'n excludes The rest; or argument, perhaps, usurps The throne of pathos; or the passions, free From previous forms, as great emergence calls, Burst on a CATILINE's devoted head Impetuous. Thus, my liberal youth, thy art Uunravelled and illustrated, erelong Shall bid thee seize the moments to persuade, Soon as thy persevering practice adds To knowledge, vigor; and to nervous strength Adroit activity. And now survey The high importance of persuasion's power— The power of human conduct! Awful trust! Yet haply thine! And O! if doom'd to guide, Blest arbiter of good, the moral scale; Whether thy care to vindicate the rights Of outrag'd innocence, and crush the fiends That weave the specious artifice; or stem, In evil hour, corruption's torrent tide; Or shine the sacred delegate of heaven; O! be thy study to impress on all The features of thy honest worth, and gain The fame of virtue! Hence persuasion draws New dignity and grace! Attention hangs Enamour'd, on the music of a voice Inspir'd by genuine probity; and breath'd From unaffected goodness! Charms, like these, Are virtue's!—Yet her semblance, uninform'd By the warm heart, how vain! O feed the fires That glow in generous bosoms! Be thy care To give each exemplary deed the force Of truth, and plain sincerity of soul! For there's an energy in conscious worth— A noble daring that excites the flame Of emulative merit, spreads around A kindred feeling, and impels the mind To all that high activity, the source Of happiest execution. Such the fire Of ancient days, while Greece survey'd her sons Crown'd, awful victors, with the double wreath Of eloquence and virtue! With an eye Prophetic of its quick-rekindling beams, Thy Albion to effulgent glory weaves That wreath: And—“Be it thine, (she raptur'd cries) “Auspicious youth, to nobler deeds foredoom'd, “To merit all the renovated rays; “And, thus, reflected from thy brighter brows, “Beyond the boast of Greece be Albion's fame!” END OF THE FIRST BOOK. BOOK THE SECOND. ON THE ELOQUENCE OF THE BAR. Genius of British law, who lov'st the smile Of freedom's open aspect; tho' deduc'd From Norman ancestry—a warrior-brood Stern-featur'd—Genius, whose parental eye Kindles in triumph o'er thy studious dome Fast by the banks of Thames, where many a youth Still adds new treasure to his mental stores, Foster'd by thee!—O hear, nor slight the muse Who, erst, an humble visitant, aspir'd To ope persuasion's portals, and unveil Her living altar!—hear, and bid thy sons Attend: for them I reassume the lyre. If, then, my pupil, thou hast trac'd thy sphere Peculiar, in my various verse; and view'd The oration's first essential, as it suits Thy favourite aims; still sedulous, revolve That first essential—argument: its source Explore; pursue it to its ends; and, last, Its object with attentive care survey. Thus, shall thine emulous instructor lead Thy steps to scenes of contest; mark thy cause, Thine audience, and opponent; and inspire The quick adroitness that elicits truth. Wide is the extent of reasoning; yet observe Its legal limits. Tho' thine active mind Dive into deepest argument, and draw From its internal fount of reason, truths That carry strong conviction; 'tis in vain They flow, unless united with the stream Sprung from that other source extrinsic judg'd— Authority. Here fix thy studies; here Approach the laws of Albion, and her acts Of senatorial wisdom: Here behold Thy circumscribing circle: Hence the strength Of argument, whate'er its destin'd end, Educe; and to the litigated point Apply, not careless of forensic forms. For, vainly think not, tho' the classic school Of eloquence hath charm'd thy tranced hours, That, there, the just—the appropriate model claims Thine imitative labours. Unconstrain'd, From equity's intrinsic source, (to all Perspicuous), and the heart's decisions stamp'd By Nature's seal, and man's primæval laws, The immortal champions of the forum drew Their more persuasive numbers. Short their code, And simple; wedded to no toil austere; Nor asking many a lustrum, to devote The midnight lamp to musing. To combine The quick varieties of thought; to snatch From elocution all the heightening grace Of diction; and amuse the million's eye By each external impulse; this their boast, This was their aim. No deep immuring pile (The science of innumerous tomes) opprest The mental strength elastic; nor perplex'd By facts from mazy records, the free flow Of speech, that never hesitating ran Thro' easy vein. And while (the rare result Of letter'd art) the precious volume gave Its treasures to the few—perhaps no more Accessible, and barr'd from vulgar gaze; They bade retentive memory on their mind Impress each image, in distinctive lines That mock'd erasure. Hence the pleader, bold In vigorous thought, and trusting to those powers Which knew no ready refuge in the means Of foreign aid, unlock'd with nature's key The secret springs that agitate the soul! But, not here only the civilian, proud Of high untramel'd eloquence, gave scope To daring declamation: his career Brav'd every check, impetuous; whilst in groupes Distinct thro' varied character or age, Or feelings or opinion, the mixt tribe Of numerous judges, by the changeful mien, The assenting nod, the favouring murmur, looks Applausive, and full many a sign yet dash'd With frowns and not unanimous, betray'd The judgment's feeble rule amidst a crowd Of warring wills, and passion's lawless sway, And fond caprice that fluctuates as it feels Its own reactive impulse! Hence the fire That wing'd each word; and all the enticing arts Which Albion's philosophic taste condemns, As rant or artifice. Her temperate eye Turns from the flaming picture, where (perchance In guilt's dark cause) amid the stoled tribe Persuasion's swift-descending genius swells The oration's period; rolls the indignant orb Against the accusing witnesses; in rage Adverts to fabricated injuries; asks Forgiveness from the sympathetic soul, In gestures that seem trembling at the touch Of agony severe; and scattering round The illusion of theatric forms, convokes Haply some parent and his little race In sorrow's weeds; 'till, dup'd into belief Of all his fancy fabled, he o'erwhelms Ev'n wary wisdom; and bids vanquish'd hosts Sink in the mighty magic of the scene! Far other task, young orator, be thine; Strenuous, within the ramparts of the law, To give thy talents the resistless force Of legal science. For, here only, lies The path, where, hastening with her civic wreath, Fair oratory comes, to crown thy toil. But not as thy compeers (who oft confine Their labors to the secondary tome Compil'd by modern industry) reject The legends, whose illuminated page Unveils the painted Briton; or the bird Of Rome quick-pouncing on the scythed car; Or treacherous HENGIST, by the pale moon, drench'd In British blood, or the fire-tressed Dane. From days of simpler aspect, such as these, Deduce the ties of law, how multiplied By vice and various luxury! Yet not long Let prospects dim'd by fiction's mist, detain Thy philosophic eye; tho' haply there The cromlehs of the druid judge uprear'd Their reverential piles beneath the gloom Of cavern'd oaks, to strike Cornubia's sons With chill dismay—tho', there, an OFFA tower'd High in the lists of legislative fame! Nor, ev'n amid the relics that record An ALFRED's or an EDWARD's skill, protract Thy curious search; content with transient gaze To mark obscurer systems. No—be thine To muse on each original, where law Distinct appears. The feodal tenure trace— Its rise—its dissolution: from the wreck Still extant, many a scatter'd relic meets The observing glance. The historic truth, or scene, Or incident, with legal science link'd, Delineate: hail the charter; hail the dawn Of parliaments—tho' first thy transports see (The boast of Saxons!) from beneath the weight Of Normandy's oppressive throne arise That antient jury—not misdeem'd the mound Of freedom, stronger than the cliffs that guard Britannia's cities from the wave! Behold Thy Albion views it with the tremulous fears Of fond parental vigilance; alarm'd Ev'n at a momentary blast, that blows Where the dark cloud convolves its lurid skirts, Pavilioning the tyrant!—yet assur'd Of sheltering safety, while, thro' all the lapse Of ages, her distinguish'd sons to thwart The monarch's threat'ning efforts have arisen, With blushes kindled at the vestal flame Of honor; with the liberal love of law; Unblemish'd faith; the high-transmitted sense Of equity; and all the glowing soul That lives in truth and feeling! Such thy praise, O ERSKINE, brightest of those sons!—adorn'd With laurels that outvie the Grecian palm, Victor in British eloquence! In vain The sterner terrors of a MANSFIELD's eye Frown'd on thy firmness! Tho' the patriarch judge Sinking thro' venerable years, and sage In legal wisdom, an attentive awe Inspir'd; the rights of injur'd Britons claim'd Thy deeper reverence! Thus, ingenuous youth, Shall the clear insight penetrate the maze Of complicated law; whether thy art Elucidate the darker customs, sprung From immemorial time, or on the acts Of senates found its greatness. Yet the task Claims resolution's firmest force.—How few Can bid attention sedulously wake To the pale lamp; while, round, the vacant mirth Of dissipation roars; while pleasure's voice Echoes the lulling music through the groves, That, like some wizard's fabled garden, float Effusing radiance on the skirts of night; Or while a SIDDONS, in impassion'd tones (As her soul rushes thro' her form) transports And chills; or meretricious beauty rolls The soft voluptuous eye! How many a youth Whom all a parent's fondness nurs'd for fame— How many a youth to late repentance pours A waste of sighs!—EUGENIO's morn of life Open'd, in golden prospect, on a mind Unspotted; on the genuine sense of right; And plain sincerity; a sparkling ray From fancy; and pure taste from classic lore; Enlighten'd sentiment; and no mean thirst For praise; whilst ardent emulation points His views not unaspiring, where the dome Of science mingles with the distant heaven! And, ah! what visions to a father's eye, Hope-pencil'd, rise—when now the starting tear Of filial duty trembles; as he leaves For proud Augusta the rever'd repose Of his paternal shade. “Go, my lov'd boy, “Go to a world, where manners yet unmark'd “Shall meet thine eye—where strong temptation spreads “The dazzling charm—where many a specious lure “May draw thy young simplicity from fame “And virtue! Yet far other views my hope “Hath given; and may a bounteous power confirm “The voice that bids thee, still thyself, repel “Whate'er may lead thee from the silent path “Of thy appropriate labours, or relax “The ties of duty: so may honors croud “Around thee, riches bless thy toil, and worth “Conspicuous in a sphere that shall command “The reverence of mankind, present thy powers “The shield to guard thy country!” From a sire Thus eloquent in love—a mother's looks Where fondness beam'd ineffable, he hastes To fame's bright area. There, the approv'd pursuit Show'd, regular awhile, the studious mind. But, soon, his sprightly fancy overleap'd The proper limits, fearful as she rov'd, Nor vagrant long. 'Twas then that elegance, Which only the poetic bosom feels, Sported, with an amusive lustre gay; Rendering the darkness of the abstruser law More visible—a blank contrasted gloom. What tho', in tremulous haste, he oft recall'd Attention to its wonted task; how vain Each effort, while his fond idea strove To give imagination proper scope, And rein it as he will'd; ere use had fix'd His aims—his studies. Nor the reckless tribe Amid the festal moment spar'd such strains As slight the code voluminous, and paint To passion, all the sweetly-thrilling glow A Thais boasts. Still undebauch'd, he blames The rare excess; and hails the chambers, mark'd For his intense research. There silence lends Deep meditation aid, as with hush'd wing Brooding on the sequester'd spot she holds Her little empire; or with noiseless step Circling her dome, (whose airy windows front Thy stream, salubrious Thames, and the green hills Of open Surry)—chases wild uproar, The din of wheels, the rabble's deaf'ning shout, And the harsh confluence of promiscuous sounds; Where each pent street swarms populous, thro' the shade Of towering edifices—all involv'd In murky smoke and putrid stench obscene. From hurrying dissonance retir'd, and blasts Contagious, into calm repose, where fresh The breezes flow; full oft EUGENIO turns The abstracted page of knowlege. Yet recurs Each image of his comrade-train, their jests And pointed ridicule: while sick distaste Slackens his toil, nor emulation sees Its rival objects; and the distant views Of good sink, lessen'd, into shade; and scenes Of present pleasure with attractive hue Slide on the sight. Behold, the dream of joy Swims round; and, 'midst the fever of the bowl, Vice, subtile sorceress, lurks, to lure her prey Unweeting. See her magic touch impels His madden'd senses to the harlot bowers That bloom o'er death's dark cave. Still, still, escape— And life was near, had resolution barr'd Relapse; while linger'd the repentant blush Of shame! But repetition blunts the steel Which, erst, had stabb'd; and each sensation dies That rose from conscious honor! Heavy hangs Each hour; and wearisome the couch, where light His slumbers, at the dawn of morning, flew; Where his invigorating genius wak'd Its active fires; where, erst, reflection held Its friendly mirror, to his ardent eye Painted with fairy visions! Ah! too soon, They disappear! while, sad reverse, he sees For innocence the livid stain of guilt Impure; for health's gay spirit and warm flush, The slow-consuming canker of disease; And, for paternal blessings, as the dew Of heaven, a parent's rage, a parent's tears. For thee beneath a happier planet born, Never may frantic dissipation lead Thy judgment from the ponderous tome—the source Whence all its vigor springs—a source, that shines Discover'd in clear light; while, now, the cause Intrusted to thy care and talents, calls To action. Yet attend the previous rules That teach, how best invention shall educe Its arguments from memory's copious stores, The stores of law. Ere then, the bar invites, Frame, oft, the ideal cause; and, in deep thought Musing amid thy closet's stillness, fix The imaginary client's case, revolv'd Thro' all its parts; nor in the scales of law Pois'd with unequal balance; every plea And every probable objection weigh'd, Till freely flows invention, (yet more free To flow, as exercise unceasing swells Its stronger current), 'till arrangement gives To all thy argumentative detail Its due distinctness. But, unless thy skill Separate and class with care the varying kinds Of argument, promiscuous will they mar All useful method. Know, the proper points Of logical deduction that engage The speculative powers of man, and bring His oratorial talents into life, In three great ends converge—the common theme Of all—to literary minds, the ground Of philosophic theories—to the rude, Of practical pursuit. While PLATO's thought Soars in the high discussion of the true, The good, the fair; truth, interest, duty strike In plainer forms, the multitude. To these (The universal principles) appeal'd The orators of old, nor intermix'd Their arguments of three-fold class; intent To prove each clear position, ere they prest What duty dictates—arguing on the sense Of right, or labour'd to evince the good They painted. Yet more limited thy care To weave, in apt accordance with the laws, The proofs of justice and of truth; adhere To stated facts; nor vainly interpose, Intrusive, to persuade the veteran judge To fair decision, by the full display Of interest or utility. To truth Thy path directs thee; first as lightly moves The series of thy reasoning, but ascends In potent climax till the weightier force Conviction. Yet, if doubt hang o'er thy cause, Instant to thine antagonist oppose Thy fairest show of reason, nor betray Thy weakness by the slight attack. If facts That ask the labour of detail be thine, Tho' of a trival nature when survey'd Apart, yet close-connected such as rise To strong presumptive evidence; here best Thy subject can determine thee, to form Those apt conjunctions which may give the power Of mutual illustration, and the force Of full-concenter'd light. But, happier thou To spread in wide expansion every fact Strong in itself, and meeting the keen search Of opposition's eye—thro' every point Tho' various, singly shifted and diffus'd; Till ev'n suspicion nods assent, and truth Beams as the splendor of meridian skies. Thus then the source of argument, the laws, And thus its ends contemplated, proceed Bold in the auspicious progress, and address Its object the judicial powers. From these The essence of forensic speech arose; To these direct thine aim. To common sense Unform'd by institution; or to cool And deep-deciding wisdom be thy thoughts Convey'd, in simple unimpassion'd phrase. For, vainly to the doubting jury shines The rich allusion: vainly bursting sighs Assail the unshaken bench. Here fancy feels Its weakness—here tumultuous passion dies! Not that forensic eloquence excludes Imagination, whose peculiar sway The senate owns: not that the passions, here, (Whose sacred influence trembling fanes confess) Invariably exert their force in vain. Fancy may recommend the abstruser terms Of law; and o'er austerity diffuse A winning softness, as she gives the grace Of numerous elocution to adorn The subtlest subject. Yet but seldom ask Imagination's aid: and still more rare Let specious wit to thy assistance rise; That, often, when exhausted reason fails, Catches with momentary glance the crowd. Such rules as thy attentive care revolves, Behold, amid the imaginary cause, Conscious of still retirement action springs Uncheck'd—or by the mirror that gives back Each gesture hence constrain'd—or by the sword's Impending point—vain puerile conceit! No—to thy feelings let free action speak The process of the oration, and express Passion's quick changes, if thy cause allow. There, haply, pity may with sighs survey The suffering client, anger execrate Oppression's iron fang, or patriot zeal Rise with a noble vengeance to reclaim The public freedom, and arrest that arm Which strove to stab it thro' the bleeding rights Of trampled individuals.—Such the height Thy art shall gain, if thine own ardent mind Befriend thy studies. With no guiding clue To lead thee through the labyrinth of the laws, Thine is to seek thy solitary way. For vain the formal lecture, skimming o'er The surface of its subject—every sound By no unmerited proscription doom'd To waste its echoes in the desert hall. Not but the templar with unsanction'd wit Oft deems the lecturer leaden; and, seduc'd By vagrant fancy, scorns the servile task Of regular attendance. Be it thine To vindicate thy veteran, while his care Claims but a trivial praise. Tho' lax or dull His superficial manner, join not thou Each flippant censure. Yet the unheeded schools Of English jurisprudence, far surpass'd By ancient seminaries, scarce deserve Our transient survey. Persia's docile youth, Nurs'd in the school of justice from the days Of early childhood, and imbibing there The principles of right, shone eminent In reasoning and the faculty of speech. Thus too the Roman institution form'd (Tho' by no codes abstruse) the expanding mind To moral sensibilities; infus'd The love of beauteous order, by debates On virtue link'd with policy; and trac'd For many a little advocate, adroit In his habitual pleadings, the fair line Of civic honours. Say, can Britain boast Such discipline? Her toiling sons that dive Too late for legal treasures, but emerge With painful struggles from the depths of law. Yet, Isis! BLACKSTONE claims thy gratitude: And, oft, the British barrister hath risen Deck'd with the pearls of science. We have seen The templar's unassisted efforts seize Gems that might dazzle Rome's instructed tribes. For we have hail'd a BEARCROFT's easy flow, His clear precision—we have view'd a JONES In erudition multiform, extend The British spirit over Indian climes! Aw'd have we met a LOUGHBOROUGH's eagle eye Darting vivacious science from the seat Judicial, while his vigorous thoughts were grac'd With rich luxuriant language! Nor unmark'd A BULLER's penetrating sense—his mind, That with a fierce velocity hath spread Conviction round, the stern tribunal arms With active law! To dignities like these, Young pupil, let thy hopes aspire: nor vain The proud ambition; if to native power Of intellect thou add the unwearied toil, That ere the sun shall gild the horizon opes The studious tome, nor closes at pale eve. IF, then, thy animated genius feel, Thro' frequent composition and the force Of long habitual practice in the shade Of privacy, its vigor strung for war— For high debate—behold the thronged hall Where justice beckons to her aid thy youth Now trembling; while thy fine emotions raised In various perturbation speak thy sense Of character, thy diffidence of strength To gain the profer'd honours, and the dye Just wavering to determine at a cast The color of thy life! Yet go; nor dread A liberal audience, whose applause shall hail Thy first essay. And see, thy subject comes To take the full possession of thy soul! And, while a manlier animation stamps Thy powers, and bids thee to thyself attach Thy client's cause; each faint misgiving fear Expires, and genius unembarass'd scorns Its former aims, and towers to radiant heights Its solitary efforts never knew! If knowlege furnish the firm-ton'd reply, Thy faithful memory prompts thee to display Each unsophisticated fact advanc'd By thine antagonist: and tho' the feints Of disingenuous artifice distort The objected proof, or labour to suppress By many a subtle subterfuge the force Which braves the unmask'd attack; thy candor, bold In unconcealing openness, admits Thine adversary's fairer pleas, and spurns The wreath that circles the deceitful brow. Hence, then, thy prepossessing cause shall meet Its just redress; where unperverted law Repels the false illusion, and enchains Accurst chicane! thy fluctuating tribes. But not enough that knowlege of thy cause (The fruit of previous search) illume thy mind; That hence thy willing oratory link Each fact in flowing series; that thy zeal Arm thee with such an energy as speaks Thine undissembling spirit; or that truth (Still more attractive than thy cause) concede The opponent's fairer plea. Know, many a point Yet never gain'd amid seclusion, asks Thy care; and asks it only, where resort They, whom thy palpitating bosom notes With emulous warmth—the masters of thy art! There best shall nice discernment see, and use Transfer—what never bard essay'd to sing— The legal Process, and the legal phrase Of immemorial origin. My song With vain attempt may separate the shades Of character that mark the two-fold scene, Where justice ponders on the civil case, Or to the criminal withdraws her view: Here, fix'd in deep decision on the pleas Of property; there, balancing the scales Of liberty or durance, life or death. Yet, featur'd hence, thy oratory wears A twofold aspect. If attention trace The mazy ambiguities of right Disputed or infring'd, and by the rules Of simple or of complicated law Decide;—then stricter logic, to discuss, And depth in legal science, to apply, Shall give thy plainer eloquence a cast Of shade unchequer'd by the intrusive rays Of metaphoric light—but yet reliev'd By its more transient lustre. To the pomp Of fateful retribution if the muse Guide thy discriminating eye, behold The law less intricate; and many a case Ev'n level to the common mind, and fraught With deeper interest—while terrific “shakes The mortal urn!” And, hence, a liberal scope For more impassion'd descant—for the appeal To juries, who, tho' inexpert and rude Yet feeling their sublimer function, catch The instinctive sigh descending in a flow Of more familiar diction to the heart; The apostrophe that marks the galling chain Of the wan prisoner; and the address, that sifts The story with nice scrutiny, confronts Each fair-examin'd witness, and detects Full oft the deep imposture's winding maze. Yes! tho' the infernal brood of falshood broach The forged tale; here, unappall'd her cheek! Here, here protected stands white innocence— White in her own pure lustre! No fell rack She fears—no dire inquisitor of death. YET into other climates if the muse Excursive wander—since, forensic youths! She closes, here, the dry preceptive strain— Full many a sufferer may she note, foredoom'd To vengeance; while amid concealment's haunts Triumphs the dark informer, undisturb'd. From British bosoms oft the generous sigh, Wafted by sympathizing pity, flows To Gallia's coast; as her state minions press Like panthers, thro' the gloom of night, and seize The wretch untried, and bear him to the cells Of castled horror—never more to feel The orient's cheering light and warmth, or taste One dear domestic pleasure! All unknown His fate, perhaps the partner of his soul Pierc'd by the fancied images she paints (Yet not surpassing truth) shudders and dies! And see the judges in mock grandeur move On Tajo's banks, as persecution's blaze Enwraps the livid culprit; o'er whose frame Emaciate, each torn nerve and muscle strain'd By oft repeated torture, had appear'd Distinctly visible; and every bone In dislocating agonies shot forth Thro' all the writhing body, that lay stretch'd On the dread engine! Thus, in every land Where tyranny uprears his giant form, The cries of outrag'd nature loud proclaim— That his associate cruelty hath steep'd The dropping sceptre, unappeas'd, in blood. Just heaven! can he, who boasts the rights of man, Whether the Seine or Tajo, or the clime Of pale Byzantium character his soul— Heaven! can the beings, whose primæval lot Was freedom, yet survey the despot drench'd In human gore; and not, indignant, rend (His demons trembling) the mysterious veil Of secret machination? Where the mosques Of MAHOMET high-shoot their gilded spires, How many a janissary-sabre waves To the cold shriek of death! An AMURATH nods Vindictive!—Straight I see the yawning cave Where clanks the pallid mussulman his chain To meet the bowstring, or the venom'd draught That tinctures the dark chalice!—Turn thine eyes Where gay gondolas glance o'er Adria's gulph: There mercy sheds an agonizing tear, Pointing to young FOSCARI; whose sad fate Told in Venetian story, hath aspers'd Its page.—DONATO, a Venetian lord, Not far from his piazza'd dome, at eve, Fell by a hand unknown; when, sudden, past A menial of FOSCARI, and, ere morn, Had fled from Venice. Hence the senate deem'd The master an assassin, that had sent His slave to deal the blow. O early lost, Much injur'd youth! What tho' thy purer fame, Thy undisguis'd demeanour, and thy looks Of open candor, mingled every charm Which might have seal'd the eye, that never felt The closed lid—suspicion's restless orb; Yet to thine innocence the fiend affix'd The guilty stain!—No sigh from virtue's soul Avail'd to soothe the senatorial voice, That bade thee fly Venetia's rage, and hide 'Mid Candia's cliffs, an exile—Candia, once The glorious seat of legislative fame, The nurse of antient MINOS—the retreat Of heaven's bright race; where each ambrosial vale Embower'd a god! Ah, sunk amid the isles, A den for slavery, whilst oblivion's breath Spreads o'er its hundred cities, as the dews Of its own Lethe!—Yet its groves, still rich With fruits and foliage, wave—its yellow fields, With various grain; and its purpureal hills Still swelling with the clustering grape, announce The promis'd vintage!—But in vain they wave, In vain they blush, to the poor exile's eye Which wildly wanders o'er the restless surge; And straining from the lone beach to the mists That dim the horizon, asks if some white sail Might, haply, gain upon the sight—some bark Streaming the well-known pendant. Many a year Heavily linger'd, while “thro' hope deferr'd “Sicken'd his heart”—tho', oft, her golden light Gleam'd, fleetingly—when, near, Venetian sails Seem'd o'er his freshen'd spirit, as they came, To waft the sweetness of his native air! Alas! his friends, tho' pitying, still declin'd The mediatorial task. To Milan's duke (As if his last sole refuge) he entrusts His prayers for friendly rescue—with a slave, Who, faithless, to Venetia's lords betrays The tale of woe. Incens'd the nobles hear— And (as their law condemns the wretch who flies To foreign potentates) remand him home Doom'd to severer anguish. His wan limbs Bound to the torturing-wheel, the feeble voice Hangs tremulous upon his bloodless lips: “May heaven forgive my persecuting foes— “My heart forgives them! Yet, a moment, hear— “Yet, but a moment, pity! while I tell “That him who bore my message I believ'd “In treachery not unpractis'd; and foresaw “He would betray the trust! Thus, o'er the seas “Hurried to meet my judges, I yet hop'd “Once more to visit the delightful spot “That gave me birth—to share, thro' racking pain— “Tho' death repay'd, a friend's fond lingering looks; “And bathe my bosom in parental tears, “And die in peace!”—He spoke, and look'd around In vain, for mercy, thro' the prison-gloom— She beam'd not, there. Instead of mercy's voice, The sentence echoed: “That, to Candia's isle “Returning, he should lie, for one long year, “Chain'd to the desolated dungeon; thence, “(The term expir'd) to wander o'er its rocks “Thro' life an outcast.” Yet, one little space The despot's pity granted, for the throbs Of filial duty from its dearest joys For ever torn. His age-bent parents came— The venerable father—on whose brow Hoar time had scatter'd many a silver hair Distinctly trac'd, and who full thirty years Had worn the purple—the pale mother, wild Thro' grief—“My son (exclaim'd the sire) 'tis thine “To bear thy fate with firmness!” “'Tis a fate “(Answer'd FOSCARI) which I dread, ah more “Than the last agonies that rend in death “The struggling frame! O by this bursting heart “Which ever own'd affection's purest glow, “Warm for a parent's welfare—by the tears “Of innocence, that ask a father's love “To give it yet unsullied to the world— “O, by the mercies of a Saviour, shield “Thy son—nor let each solitary groan “Beat—the slow knell of his departing soul!” “Alas! FOSCARI! all my power were vain— “Submit thee to thy country's laws”—the doge Replies; and, hurrying from his son's embrace, 'Twas his to suffer every pang from woe, Till apathy had ic'd his bosom o'er, Yet left life's feeble spirit!—But to paint The mother's form—O ye, whose hearts have felt The fond maternal yearnings—ye, whose eye Hath caught the last fix'd glances of your child Just sinking into death's cold dew—'tis yours— Severe preheminence! to paint that form. At length, the dire disastrous story ran Thro' Venice: and the accumulated woe Touch'd the relenting senate; while remorse, That strove to borrow the benignant air Of mercy, the poor exile's pardon seal'd. Strait flew the mandate of recall: In Candia's cells immur'd, the youth had mourn'd (for long, His country lost.) But ah! too late the ray Of mercy glimmer'd. Lo the hapless youth, Amidst his dismal durance as he breath'd The solitary groan, on the drear wall Had etch'd his tale of misery, and expir'd! Albion! not thus the umpires of thy laws Usurp an arbitrary rule, or claim A latitude of judging, undefin'd: While each, superior to the servile sense Of mercenary motives, owns no guide But law; and, nobly independent, scorns The practis'd smile of flattery; while no gust Of passion with uncertain eddy blows; And while opinion, prankt in gaudy vest, Shifts no cameleon colors! Generous youth! Deem not, tho' uncurb'd tyrants round thee wield In other climes, the bolts of vengeance red With fiercer fires and lanc'd thro' wider air, Deem not thy sphere less awful. Tho' represt Despotic rage, 'tis justice checks that rage— 'Tis mercy—the sweet attribute—the balm Which drops from heaven! Nor think, tho' antient pomp Dazzle thine eye—tho' the throng'd Roman bar, Or Areopagus unfold its tribes Of purpled judges—think not Albion sees Abash'd the grandeur of the proud display; While wisdom far surpassing theirs, the glow Of freedom, an impartial power diffuse An all-commanding dignity around Her high tribunal—her firm-rooted throne. Thrice happy Britons! while 'tis yours to view The majesty of justice, undismay'd! Thrice happy Britons! while 'tis yours to feel, In every dubious case, the lenient power Of interposing mercy—happier, still, O then most happy, if ye knew the worth Of those pure laws whose energy sustains The fairest constitution time hath rear'd Thro' all the works of ages! Britons, wake To glory—wake to vengeance! In the dust Trample a felon tribe with candid fronts, Yet bearing murderous bosoms! Crush to earth Those prostituted hirelings that o'errun The land, in treacherous combination leagu'd; Like Rome's insidious advocates (while Rome Degenerate sunk to earth) a reptile race, From the fell hissings of whose viper tongues The pontic monarch turn'd his wounded ears Abhorrent! Such to infamy betray The talents nature in her bounty gave, And culture might have ripen'd as the shield Of property and life! Alas! the days Of innocence are past, that erst secure Claim'd no protection from the stranger shield Of legal genius. Vain the formal code, When liberty alone was law; when all Was halcyon quiet;—ere corruption marr'd The fair design of being, or the strife Of warring tongues arose, on Shinar's plain! Then, nor ambition ever knew to lure, Beyond the barrier of their proper sphere, The grateful progeny; nor wild desire Of gain infring'd the universal faith That, as the common right of all, ensur'd The gifts indulgent heaven supplied, and ask'd No brighter boon than liberty and love! 'Twas then, the unaspiring shepherd, free From guilty throbbings, down the palmy vale Or up the cedar-shadow'd mountain drove His fleecy charge—innocuous as the lamb That playful frisk'd before him! Then no fence Arose to bound their pastures, or protect The fearless rangers from the unheeded pard That oft, beneath the inwoven foliage, stretch'd His spotted length. 'Twas then, the friendly shade Of night unmark'd by prowling rapine, bore No pale suspicion on its darksome wing, To hover at the unbolted gate; where truth And confidence unlimited, and all The unalloy'd delight that freely springs From happiness reciprocally shar'd— Gave to society its genuine sweets; And bade (that high prerogative of man) The power of speech, express the unsullied heart, And harmonize with virtue. And tho' there No rostrum to ambition's eye display'd The palms of oratory, still the glow Benevolent of patriarchal age Distinctive in the hoary father, fix'd Thro' eloquence more amiable, the rules Of nature and of conscience; while the race Of earth, in general consonance, confest Primæval bliss! one language and one law! END OF THE SECOND BOOK. BOOK THE THIRD. ON THE ELOQUENCE OF THE SENATE. Ere yet the plains of Marathon were drench'd In Persia's blood, imperial Athens hail'd Her system of superior law; elate With visionary views of freedom's reign. “Behold (she cried) a system fram'd to suit “The genius of my democratic tribes “Whose ancestry were demigods! Behold “My freedom, hence establish'd, on a throne “Of adamantine strength!”—Thee, SOLON, thee The generous transport of Minerva's sons The universal father term'd, and kiss'd Thy sacred code. And see, the assembled crowd With zeal enthusiastic, while they drink The sounds that flow divinely from the tongue Of their hoar patriot, snatch the regal robe And bid it fold his limbs in purple pride, And in a momentary frenzy clasp The trappings they had spurn'd indignant! Mark The patriot's eye: no pleasure sparkles there, Or darts dishonest glances centering all In self-applause; but pure parental love, And pity's mild benignity, and grief Prophetic, speak him sovereign of the heart. Presaging ill, he sees the inconstant tribes The prey of some usurper, whose fair mien And smooth address and sweet-distilling words Might lure them into bondage. So disguis'd, Erelong, PISISTRATUS appear'd. Adorn'd By all the exterior graces which diffuse So bright a charm o'er genius that it seems Persuasion's self embodied, magic hung Upon his lips—and THESEUS' godlike race Fell crouching at his feet. The reverend sage Wept o'er the sudden impulse; and retir'd From each familiar scene, to distant climes; Tho' not despairing: for he long had read Nature's first laws; and trac'd, with curious search, The lineaments of proud Athenian minds Yet undefac'd by tyrants. The high sense Of honor, deaden'd into slumberous rest, Repos'd, as yet, unsmother'd. And its flame Rekindling fierce, might burst in vengeful wrath Round the pale despot; while some daring youth— Some brave HARMODIUS might arise, to dash The tottering throne in atoms to the ground, And give to SOLON's worth, to SOLON's laws, His rescued Athens. Still, the boding sigh, And many a melancholy pause, betray'd The legislator's mind perplex'd by doubts His wisdom vainly struggled to resolve. “What tho' my system hath oppos'd (he cried) “To factious millions a distinguish'd few, “Meet rulers; yet hath rein'd the oppressive rich “By universal right of suffrage, lodg'd “In convocated crowds; some demon lurks “Beneath the specious fabric! At this hour “Perhaps the suffering people rous'd to shame “Murmur revolt: but scarce Minerva's self “Can bar relapse to thraldom. Many an age “Shall see the insidious nobles hovering o'er “Devoted tribes—shall see, with open front, “The dark designing demagogue arise; “While spreads a rapid ferment through the throng “Rais'd by the force of eloquence, whose breath “E'er shakes tumultuous Athens!” True the sage Foretold. Full many a revolution shook The frail construction, whose discordant springs An ill-communicated motion spoke; As the fell pomp of one, exulting, crush'd The many; and the democratic rage Prevail'd; or aristocracy pursued With havock its broad track, o'erwhelming all! Nor Rome survey'd, amidst the changeful shapes Of civil policy, the blending parts Of one confederate whole; while senates warr'd With popular assemblies, whether kings Pass'd sullen by, or stern dictators frown'd, Or a decemvirate, in dread array, Scowl'd o'er her people. Say, when public cares Engag'd her throng'd comitia; and the voice Of blustring tribune, of plebeian chief, Harangu'd the unsteady multitude—impell'd To incidental judgment by a hint Ambiguous, by the inflammatory phrase, By stratagem tho' shallow yet unseen, By shifted place, a momentary turn, By a bird's flight—did freedom there preside, High goddess?—Meantime (to the senate's walls Upborne on ivory cars of curule pomp) Her fathers, rude and unenlighten'd, felt The bold philippic thunder in their ears; Shuddering at each strong period that display'd Their trampled rights, the crimes of ruffian crowds, Their evanescent glories but the shade Of old patrician grandeur! Thus misrule And anarchy disclos'd the embowel'd war Of struggling elements that rent the state. Yet TULLY's speculative eye perceiv'd The semblance of a threefold power, combin'd In compact such as ne'er historic pen Had trac'd amid the nations. Nor a glimpse Of empire to perfection brought, escap'd The sage whose penetrating genius ken'd The internal movements of the restless mind In politic societies; and drew Its features strong and luminous. His soul Imag'd in fair idea the mixt state, Where prince and peers in concert with the tribes Elected from the common mass, exert Their close-cooperating powers to frame Man's civil union. Such the form he deem'd Too pure for mortal eyes; or only meet For some Atlantic isle, where PLATO's thought Might fondly brood o'er visionary bliss; Whose white cliffs glitter to ideal suns, The haunt of genii! Yes! the Atlantic waves Kiss that elysian island!—and that isle Is Albion! Lo her guarded rocks are trod By spirits that have drank empyreal air, Light freedom, and philosophy, heav'n-sprung! Hail genii of the skies! A vagrant guest, Freedom! thy solitary steps awhile Pac'd Albion's hills, as opening thro' the ranks Of rude society with gradual glow, Shone nature's simple principle, the love Of independence; and (impell'd by thee, At fortune's happy crisis) rais'd the state A complex form.—Erelong, descending slow, Philosophy her lov'd companion join'd, And fix'd the work of liberty, on strong Unshaken basis.—If we mark the essays Of daring freedom, let us turn our eye Back to the period; where the Norman, fir'd With conquest, over Albion's vanquish'd race And o'er his victor-armies bared the laws In thunder—sudden, where his out-stretch'd hand Rent into fiefs unnumber'd the wide realm, And bade the baron and the slave, alike, Kneel in the dust. Yet, lo! the sever'd parts Beneath the pressure of the despot's sway Crush'd into coalition, give their powers To blend in one indissoluble mass! Struck from the monarch's ponderous sceptre, flew The co-resisting spirit, to renounce The universal vassalage; while knights High-helm'd, amid the proudly-scutcheon'd halls Throng'd round their armed barons, at whose board Nectareous mead from the full goblet glanc'd Its amber stream—while minstrels harp'd the deeds Of British heroes, and the vaulted roofs Echoed the song of glory! Nor the domes Of each inferior chieftain ceas'd to sound That echo! Strait, in one confederate band, Ev'n peasants, as (a vassal-troop) they rose, To bulwark the baronial rights, entrench'd With deepening foss, their own. And see, the chain Of feodal tyranny thro' all its links Relaxing, the low hamlet's brighten'd wall Reflects the chearful blaze, at evening-close, Nor heeds “the far-off curfew.” Village-peace Smooths, undisturb'd, her pinions, and sits still; Resting her eye upon the curling smoke That blends its volume with the sapphire heaven! But insecure and fleeting was the boon Of civil harmony, that, scarce enjoy'd, Fled the vain grasp. The people's threats, the torch Of dire commotion, fields o'erslow'd with blood, Perfidious treaties, and rekindled war, Past, in repeated series, ere the state Repos'd its quiet on the wills of all. And lo! to the first HENRY the bold arm Of popular resistance opes (tho' yet In dim disclosure) thro' the breaking clouds The fane of British liberty! Ev'n now The murky remnant of the gloom rolls off, While frowns the weak usurper; and its towers (At the firm bidding of her chosen chiefs) Flash on the sight! Behold, the portals wide Expanding, her majestic mien appears! And, as she waves (the banner of her fame) The glorious charter, her prophetic eye Quick glancing o'er her EDWARD's laws, descries Her infant senate rising into form; Surveys it struggling with the Tudor race, And many a despot; sees a STUART strive, Mad in tyrannic impotence, to curb Her parliament new-strung with vigorous nerve At each vindictive stroke; and raptur'd views Her statesmen glowing with the haughty sense Of recent victory, which had burst the bounds Of speech, giv'n eloquence free scope, and brav'd All mortal check;—'till, now, her triumphs hail That æra, when the people, peers, and prince, Thro' acts that fix the limits of their power, Announce her empire!—Here, 'tis here begun The period of philosophy, who beam'd The rising lustre on her conscript tribes; Gave them to feel their own appropriate rights; Develope, with precision's clearer ken, The constitutive principles; and solve By just analysis, what freedom's force, Aided by various circumstance, combin'd. Thus, then, in lineaments distinctly drawn Prerogative and privilege appear'd; Objects of vigilance; that claim'd, alike, The ministerial zeal, the patriot's care. Hence opposition's spirit, ever bold To meet the undue preponderance of power With poising scale: and hence the high debate, Still with the bounding lines in view that mark The people's freedom or the sovereign's right. Thus too, the illuminated mind survey'd Its own preheminence; while now the crowd No more assembled to distract the realm By factious strife, but trusted to a few (Their delegated chiefs) the common cause— A few deep-read in history's moral page, Inform'd by institution, and refin'd By fashion's winning ease, by luxury's charms. Hence elegant harangues, in finish'd phrase, Awakening chaste imagination, stole Attention; and, that essence of thy speech, Young pupil, ornament diffus'd its light. If, then, thy readiest apprehension note The genius of the state distinctly trac'd; The groundwork of the senatorial strain Here opens. Whilst full many a subject meets Discussion's strength, in prospect bid it lie; Whether the government's internal springs Require the regulating hand, or cares Extrinsic lead thy views to distant realms. Nor let the genius of the senate fly Thy search, elusive: here thy art shall build The structure of the oration, that delights With polish'd beauty the congenial mind. VERS'D in forensic knowlege and the powers Of legal oratory, patriot love— Perhaps ambition prompts thee to pursue The bright career of fame; and, tho' enroll'd With delegates, aspire where Ermine points Ennobled worth! And well thy merits claim The proud distinction, while thy mental eye Clearly the constitution's fabric sees. But if thou join the British senate, rude From thy paternal mansion—if thou vaunt Thine independent soul, thy unbrib'd sense Of ancient virtue, and the heroic blood That in thy veins devolves the untainted stream, Tho' arm'd with no preparatory skill In legal science; ah beware the laugh “Which scarce the firm philosopher can scorn!” Trust not to plain integrity alone, To plain uncultur'd talents. Many a sun Shall o'er thy unremitted toils revolve, Thy silent observation; ere applause Shall hail the beauties of thy fluent speech. Gifted with previous knowlege to discuss The multifarious subjects that require Deliberative skill; o'er Britain's isle Extend thy cares, redress her wrongs, disclose The internal sources of her wealth, and roll Thro' broader channels its diffusive tide. Oft, too, with accurate attention watch The empire's hoary fabric! See, where clings Corruption, mining deep its massy strength With slow corrosive canker; nor remit Thine efforts, to destroy the deadly bane. Such the high province of the good and great Thro' many a reign; tho' oft their fancy glow'd With idle projects, and amusive schemes Utopian; tho' their fond chimeric fears Flutter'd o'er weltering Albion, as foredoom'd To satiate many a harpy with her blood. Yet hath venality, with frequent clang, Sounded its pinions ominous, and snuff'd The promis'd feast. And Britons long had fall'n Its prey, but for St. AUBYN's honest pride, And WYNDHAM's worth, and CHATHAM's glorious zeal! For tho' full oft these patriot spirits strove, Too feeble to exterminate the foe, Still by reiterated force, they check'd The venom'd pest, and dash'd its rising rage. And see thine Albion balancing the scales Of European politics. Survey Her trident's strength uplifted o'er the deep; Where fleets innumerous her wide empire own, Couch to her passing glories, and announce Her pride of commerce, and her pomp of war: While, far as either India, Britain streams The imperious pendant on the scented breeze; To bear away the spices of the grove, The silk's luxuriant lustre, or the pearls Of Ormuz, softening with their rainbow tints The diamond's blaze! Meantime, the nations shake Ev'n to the banks of Ganges, at the shout Of Britain's martial triumphs—Calpe's rock Exulting, echoes back the distant sound! But, O! beyond the riches that attend Thy proud commercial intercourse, or all The power of cruel arms that deluge earth; Be thine, ingenuous senator, to prize The empire of thy legislative sway; Which wafts its liberal blessings like the hand Of heaven, amid rejoicing climes! Behold The angelic shapes thy mandate o'er the wave Speeds to the extremer countries—candid Truth; Unfetter'd sentiment, whose growing form Enlarges, as her steps approach; the mien Of portly liberty; benevolence, Her open arms unfolding, as to clasp Creation! Hark the dæmons of the east Hurrying to their incarcerate abodes, Howl at their fell dominion lost, and leave The enlighten'd tribes to happiness and thee! See, then, thy glorious delegacy, fraught With high momentous subjects. 'Tis a task That claims the intensest energies of mind! And when thy studies are matur'd, a vein Of quick expression may, perhaps, be thine, At every call; since knowledge will suggest, And ready words express perspicuous thought. But think not readiness enough: the talk Familiar that attends the mantling bowl May boast such merits. 'Tis not eloquence— Whilst neither arm'd with nervous strength, to whelm, Nor fraught with winning softness, to seduce The soul: old CATO's sternness would disdain So mean a language, ev'n tho' CATO mock'd Each artifice of elegant harangues. But know, thou hast not CATO to address With letter'd lore, and language unadorn'd: For to the sage's philosophic sense Thy audience add a delicacy, nurs'd In soft tho' not effeminating ease. Enter the concave senate; and behold Its sons with an imaginative warmth, And with a taste correct endued; a quick Perceptive keenness in the judging power, Averse to long and wearisome detail; And passion's glow, tho' not the intemperate heat That in declamatory diction burns. Whether, enrob'd amidst the splendid tribe Of Britain's peers, thou venerate the seats Where long hath beam'd the hereditary pomp; (Marking the throne of kings, now first adorn'd By royal elocution's graceful charm); Or whether, ranking with the inferior chiefs, Thou sit obedient to the people's voice; Still o'er the assembly shines that polish giv'n By education's gentle hand, which smoothes The roughnesses adherent oft to minds Unfashion'd, and precludes the essays so bold In rude uncultur'd genius—the career Of talents supereminent and vast. In such an age, the precepts of the schools Would vainly to its loftier summit bring Thy senatorial eloquence. Tho' there Rules in exactest symmetry, deduc'd From nature, may direct thy infant art; 'Tis not in formal lessons to mature Its growing strength. The diction critic rules Prescribe, deserves thine imitative aim: Yet, tho' in just analysis thou see The principles of language, and the means To gain that finish'd elegance of phrase Adapted to the genius of thy sphere; Still is that manner wanting which defies All definition, and is only caught Thro' actual observation. Thine harangue Perhaps displeases, by its frigid air, Precision nicely studied, by a want Of useful repetition that might seem Obtrusive matter to the bookworm sage. Haste, then, where easy conversation sports With all expression's negligence, whose stream Redundant flows, tho' fashionably free; That by a happy mixture of the strain To schools and living circles known, thy art May rounded to its full perfection rise. First, be thy efforts guided, liberal youth! To meliorate thy language, by the laws Of rhythmic numbers; and enrich its vein By figurative elegance. A flow Of clear syllabic harmony, that strikes With every fine variety of sound The curious ear, can give ev'n weakness strength; Set off the tritest subject, and attach A luring manner to each dry detail. How few the models of a style that boasts The veil of ease by simple nature thrown O'er artificial beauty! TULLY's self, Whose declamations exquisitely wrought Melt with a soft diffusion on the ear Or roll in deep sonorous tones, betrays Too evident a toil; while midst the pause Too oft repeated, pleasure's spell dissolves. Yet study those, whose writings have approach'd The beautiful in harmony. 'Tis thine With just discernment to select or shun Each imitable point, each vicious turn. And, if thy art, that snatches, thus, a charm From music, in her radiant sister hail The grace of glowing figures, 'tis in thee To spread imagination's lovely tint O'er all thy style. Transcribe the figures meet For ornament: explore, with studious care, Their every source, and mark, when best applied. Oft, in thy solitary hours, essay To warm thy fancy with ideal scenes That interest or delight: then give thy speech Expansive wing; and, far retir'd, declaim Amid thy patrimonial oaks, whose shade Embowers thy path. Thy fervent transport fled, Retrace each image that in rapid flight Pass'd o'er thy mind. Thus judgment shall perceive That all thy diction's figurative glow Arose from purest nature, unalloy'd. But should thy language too luxuriant seem— Too studied or elab'rate, trust the muse, 'Tis not in cloyster'd science to correct The blemish. 'Tis in manner'd courts alone Where observation hangs upon the lips Of oral elegance, to lend that aid No philologic theorist can supply. 'Tis in the circles, where exults the power Of pleasing, (CHESTERFIELD's much-boasted art), Where spirit joins with gracefulness—'tis there, Where female wit, in sparkling beauty gay, Heightens the lustre of exterior charms; Thy converse shall the metaphor chastize Too glaring, and relax its stiff attire. So shalt thou gain simplicity, that gives The richness of the figurative term And all the measur'd melody of sounds A genuine ease to colleges unknown; While every decoration shall appear Thine own spontaneous manner, scorning art. And so thy style, too close or too concise For elocution's elegance (tho' meet For a historic writer) shall acquire The just diffusion which expands a thought In diverse lights; impresses it on all By frequent repetition; by the length Of flowing periods lends an ampler scope For ornament, of every varied kind; And, thus expatiating at large, agrees With senatorial subjects that demand The copious stream, the plenitude of words. Fear not an unconnected style, too lax In negligent expression; since thy mind, With previous reading stor'd, hath power to prune The excrescent phrase familiar converse loves. Of this accordant mixture duly mark In many a mighty master of thine art The beautiful result; tho', first, observe Two great exemplars, (whom thy country views With justest admiration), not unstain'd By blemishes which our instructive song Hath clearly pointed. Thro' the shade of years If thou revert thy transitory gaze; Where, in the British senate, wilt thou fix Thy vagrant eye? Few are the chiefs that claim Our homage. Tho', at CHARLES's fateful day, Flash'd, as a light meteorous (that quick Thro' æther passes beyond mortal ken) The rapid blaze of eloquence; the muse Perceives no model, who, approaching near To finish'd oratory, can be trac'd In lines distinctive. Not that she disdains A SELDEN's vigor, or a HAMPDEN's rage, Or the devoted STRAFFORD's last essay Glorious thro' great emergence! But we haste To catch the features of a BRUNSWICK's reign Where, from a galaxy of speakers bright With indiscriminated beams, broke forth A CHATHAM's splendour! Fast the mingled rays Of the surrounding orators grew pale— Fainting into the skies! Ev'n WYNDHAM's star Was dim; and PULTENEY had no lustre, there. And, lo! the flaming son of genius, bold In native independence, and impell'd By strong ambition, seizes at a grasp The comprehensive subject, that appears Infinitude to vulgar views! His mind Original and vast, his nervous strain Unlabour'd and irregular, his voice Commanding, his eye cloath'd with lightnings, stern His aspect and terrific, as the frown Of heav'n—sublimity his every nod Attended, proud of her ministrant powers! 'Twas thus THEMISTOCLES the Athenian tribes Struck with amazement, as his eagle mind Intuitive disdain'd the softer arts Of rhetoric, trusting to its strength alone! But CHATHAM, tho' not versatile as great, Could ev'n effuse the insinuating tones Of sweetness, with so exquisite a grace, That his enchanted auditory hung Upon his breath reposing, as the wave In placid stillness rests upon the shore! Yet was he not accomplish'd. Nature gave With prodigality a mental boon, Which every eye astonish'd. Yet was art— Yet classic art was wanting there, to smooth The asperities of language; to restrain A copiousness o'erflowing the just bounds Of order, and give method to the whole— One dazzling emanation! Rude, verbose, With incorrectnesses of style, and words Inaccurately plac'd, no skill he own'd, To treat the dry unanimated theme; Nor, in the cooler moment, gain the assent Of critic judgment to his harsh essays. But, in his orb our verse unwilling points These little spots, that almost disappear Amidst the fadeless glory. Turn we, next, To living politicians; where stands forth Conspicuous in the variegated groupe, Of rhetoric no mean master—more observ'd, As with a CHATHAM's traits contrasted rise His strongly-shaded lineaments. Profuse Of florid declamation, he hath taste That, with a relish inexpressive, feels The finer beauties of the Grecian page— Say, who, like BURKE, can feel them? All the train Of classic imag'ry his mind evolves, And quick into a new creation moulds The race of fairy fancy!—But too fond Of erudite allusions—too propense To draw from antient poesy the tropes, The figures of his speech, to truth he gives A fabling air, and buries common sense Beneath an heap of metaphor. His thoughts Are methodiz'd by ARISTOTLE's rules; And (if no rival's irritating sneer Derange his plan) in regular array The series of the harangue proceeds—yet stiff Thro' regularity; and not enough Savouring of the colloquial—an harangue That might beseem the academy or school; Like some inaugural oration, rich In classic vein, beneath a pedant's eye. Then be not CHATHAM's oratory, thine— Nor BURKE's; but, blending their perfections, frame Such numbers as a CHATHAM's polish'd son Might not disdain to own! Tho' in the bloom Of years yet wiser than maturest age, Clear amid all the energy of speech, Ample yet not prolix, and (as he gains The yielding judgment o'er and captive leads The passions) rich in figures, which he brings With nice selection from the stores of taste To charm imagination—lo! he towers The pride of Albion!—Nor his active foe In vigorous talents and a speaker's worth Shines far inferior; as the deep debate With well invented argument he guides, But less embellish'd diction. To his search While universal politics, the maze Of European manners, and the intrigues Of foreign courts are uninvolv'd, his skill To illuminate his auditory, meets No rival mind;—unless a SHERIDAN With all his winning elocution rise— His keenly pointed satire, and his sport Of quick allusion! But the nobler flights Are SHERIDAN's—the bold majestic wing. Witness that unexampled strain sublime, Which, with an influence undiminish'd, sway'd (Long as the moon from her meridian heaven Bends downward to the wave) the senate's sons Unanimous—now melting into tears— Now frowning indignation; from their gloom While full the felonies of India rose, Nor trembling could escape a beam of day. Fir'd by those great ideas, can the muse Observe the senate's cooller aspect, pleas'd By COURTENAY's sparkling wit; or NORTH's replies— No more to re-enliven the dull hour? Or, can she note a STORMONT's solid sense; A RICHMOND's high inventive talents, led By patriot zeal, more beauteous than the blaze Of all his ducal glories? Or the strong— The rooted principles a THURLOW boasts, Unbias'd guardian of our sacred rights, Immutable—the Briton, truly free? But let the muse to her didactic path Reverting, the too rapturous heat allay. If, then, ingenuous pupil, thou hast read These rules and models, search into the bent Of thine own native talents. Here, perchance, Lies a peculiar bias, to create An independent manner of thine own; Or else in friendly unison agree With some congenial mind, whose features fair Take for thy just exemplar. Thus, distinct With every trait original that shews True genius on a perfect model form'd; Thy elegant oration shall address The imaginative faculty; and touch With great effect the quick percipient taste. And as that taste to nice precision wrought Contemns the tricks of rhetoric, O beware, Left in the fervor of thy kindled soul Thou catch the imperfect word, the flippant strain, Alas, too current with the conscript tribe; Who oft the vulgar proverb seize, or coin The uncouth expression. Hence new syllables Slide off into the language, and corrupt By vicious sounds its purity. Despise Each low attempt at wit; nor intermix, With legislative science, scripture-shreds. Nor ever be it thine, correctly-dull, To weary judgment by the meagre speech Creeping in all the penury of words; Whose humble merit scarce o'ershoots the mark Of base vulgarity. And shun details, And each prolix discussion; too remote From the main objects of thy proper sphere, To interest or instruct. Thus, heedless, oft, Of yawning somnolence diffus'd around, The speaker by political harangues Fatigues his audience; whilst of Russia's wealth He talks, perhaps his travels to display. Then heed not systems never doom'd to prove The touchstone of experience; but address The judgment's keen perception, that delights In the full force of nervous argument, Tho' solid yet not tedious; tho' arrang'd In order, from apparent art averse. Meantime, another attribute of mind Residing in the senate, claims thy care; 'Tis passion! But 'tis passion so subdued— So soften'd by the manners, that it seems All coldness to the fire of Athens' chiefs— To her alert vivacity, which glow'd Amidst her Areopagus—the soul Of sensibilities awaken'd wild To action, rapid action unconstrain'd! Yes! 'tis a passion o'er which taste hath breath'd Her cool soft tints; such as a STRAFFORD's air Of plaintive eloquence might haply move, If aided by his injur'd worth alone; Nor borrowing ought of adventitious help From what thy fashionable audience deems But artificial trick. The feeling scene, Where stood his little offspring rang'd around— Lifting their pleading eyes—had yet impell'd Our senatorial fathers to forgive, (Ere fashion chas'd pure instinct from the heart) Had not a persecuting spirit steel'd Their breasts to momentary pardon prone. Who could despise his unaffected strain So arm'd by truth and goodness? Who, the pause, The tear, the look of pity sweetly-thrown On his dear artless innocents; the sigh Light-rising, of a soul resign'd to heaven? Yet, mark the calmness of thy wiser peers Whose feelings only vibrate at the touch Of brighten'd pathos; while the lovelier traits Of virtue, drawn by delicacy, sink Into the heart. Then hope not to affect— Then fondly trust not thy pathetic powers: Unless, sweet nature's artist, thou hast skill To pencil her fine attitudes, her air Attractive, her free drapery's fluid folds; And, thro' imagination's medium, paint To passion. Pathos cools, where fashion reigns. Far other notions of pathetic speech The speakers of the Roman senate form'd; Who ne'er essay'd to steal into the heart, By painting to the feelings. 'Twas not theirs To touch by imagery, but to move By sympathetic strokes—to ope the effect Of each impression on their own warm mind; Not shew the mental portraiture itself, By gradual art, thro' fancy's calmer light. Pure passion dwells not on description's hues; But ever lives, (and trembles, as it lives), In indistinctest energies—a look, A tone, a gesture! Hence, the speaker's soul Enkindled, spreads its own contagious warmth. 'Tis thus the uncultur'd know the affection's force, Bias'd by nature to admire! to shake With agony, with rapture! circumscrib'd By narrow bounds; nor shap'd to scrutinize The ideas, whose obscure effect they feel. THO' senates scarce admit the wordy storm, Yet slight it not: occasions will arise To favour such a forcible display. Oft as septennial revolutions call The electors, gathering in a motley throng To re-elect or spurn their chiefs; 'tis then The torrent of thy eloquence may gain Thy point with sway resistless, and o'erwhelm The power of opposition, quench the rage Of party, or repress its smother'd flame. Image the assembled tribes—in order rang'd The more distinguish'd commons—the set speech Formal and faultering, that concisely tells The subject of discussion—the still pause— The whisperings indistinct, that circle round; While haply an addressing friend presents The candidate, who, wavering first, perplex'd For utterance, now relaxes and runs o'er (Scarce with the breathing pauses) his harangue; Soliciting—soliciting—unheard— The people's choice. And led by narrow zeal, Or poor self-interest, or a patriot flame, The partizans approach—one, character'd By rusticated manners roughening o'er The polish of half-educated youth; Another, gifted with the exterior mien More winning; tho' expressing each, in terms Inert and stiff, his mean embarrass'd thought. A third, of antient family, comes forth As his own grandsire's portrait, from its frame Escap'd, in rigid majesty supreme. But who yon' figure, with obtrusive air Shot forward?—Hark, how voluble, he vaunts The sudden splendor beam'd upon his brows By fraudulence, and rapine and chicane, An Indian upstart!—Many a vulgar sneer He points at plain hereditary sense; Mocks unassuming virtue's honest pride, And bids it seek a refuge in the cells Of dark retirement from oppression's fangs— Closing the moated castle's airy hall, Whose lofty-window'd pomp shall boast no more The rich reflection of the storied pane, But frown its horrors on the spectre-tribe Of ancestry dishonour'd! Such the force Of eastern opulence, of eastern state Too menacing!—And see the dazzled throng O'er-rul'd by peculation's offspring, hail His insolent pretensions with applause, Tho' but a fleeting murmur. For hehold! With mild address and dignity appears A long-known patriot, of ingenuous birth, Ingenuous virtue!—O'er his placid mien A prepossessing lustre softly spreads; And each inferior speaker shrinks abash'd: Whilst with the modesty that e'er adorns Pure unpretending merit, he unfolds The topic of discussion in a vein Of elocution's flowing ease; adverts To popular opinions, sketching clear The feature of the times; with keen address Observes the general temper of the crowd; Seizes in quick transition (yet with art Too latent to be visible) the sparks Of momentary spirit; at a stroke Lays bare the party-zealot's dark design; And, lashing the mean agents of intrigue, On ev'ry point expatiates unrestrain'd— Till now the oration rises into all Its energy; and his electric eye And every animated gesture act His ardent speech, his vehemence of thought. He ceases. An extatic pause succeeds, That bars all utterance—when a mingled shout Applausive echoes to the concave heaven! In vain the poor contentious party tries The feebleness of hesitating tones And broken periods: Indian pomp in vain Flutters the ruffled honours of its plumes! All yield—the multitude borne swift away— Asia's high chiefs, and “yahoo-squires,” alike, Sink in the impetuous whirl, ingulph'd and lost! And great, indeed, that eloquence, empower'd, Where erst dishonor triumph'd, to oppose Skill to deep skill; give probity the charms Which varnish over vice; and her own arts Against herself direct with dext'rous aim— Those colourable arts her motley spawn Vaunt to the world's broad glare. With idle arm Truth holds the unpolish'd targe against design And fell oppression. No romantic muse Would warn thee, that, beneath the senate's roof, The blustering CLEON claims thy vigilance Suspicious; the smooth orator, adept In tricks theatrical; and he, who points, Colossal plunderer, with a tyrant's air, His gorgeous spoils. Since, then, the task were vain Amid a cumbrous empire's wide display, Its fashions, luxuries, its commercial pride, Its opulence and grandeur, to restore Thy country to primæval plainness—deem'd Of old the close companion of pure worth; Since idle every effort to recall Simplicity of manners, be thy care To bid magnificence and ornament Subserve integrity; o'er subject earth To spread the greatness of the British laws; With an extensive empire co-extend The virtues, whose kind influence softens life; And nurture, with a patron's liberal warmth, Fancy and taste: hence sprung thy splendid art; And, lo, to these addrest, thy eloquence Shall from corruption gain her host of slaves! END OF THE THIRD BOOK. BOOK THE FOURTH. ON THE ELOQUENCE OF THE PULPIT. What time my young unpractis'd muse essay'd, In harsh prelusive numbers, to unfold The principles of eloquence, the smile Propitious of the few that love the lyre, Nor turn, averse from its didactic sounds, Waken'd my ardent hopes. Hence Albion heard The bolder descant on her sapient bar: Hence was her senate sung: and hence, to close My theme, the pulpit claims a loftier lay. Come, (since the view of oratory meet For earth hath long precluded from my sight A nobler prospect), come, æthereal muse, And with thy friendly rays illume the path That leads to heaven!—Come, muse of fire, allied To seraphim—O thou, whom God's own bard Sounding to epic notes his harp, invok'd Delighted, whether thy free footsteps rov'd On Sion-hill, or fast by Siloa's brook; Come, and the hallow'd oracles unveil Of inspiration—what the visitant Of Aganippe's fount or Acidale Might fly abash'd; as from Ithuriel's spear The demon started! So shall they, who guide The unlettered people, mark religion's power Persuasive, to direct the common mind. Thus too, sublime inspirer, by thine aid May I develope subjects undisclos'd To superstitious Athens, whose dark zeal “Inscrib'd her altar to the unknown God.” For say, my liberal pupil, (not in vain Nurtur'd amid the hoary domes and walks Of Cam or Isis, if thy tutor'd mind Have with the pagan treasures intermix'd The christian's purer wealth), say hath thine eye Observ'd in history or in fabling lore, Topics so greatly solemn as we draw From sacred wisdom? Say, can ought on earth Tho' it transport the affections into flame, Raise and refine their nature, like the heaven That beams upon the christian saint? Go search The historic page; and pause amidst the pomp Of swelling declamation. At the head Of armies, listen to the leader's voice— The voice, that from her tented slumber wakes Ambition to fell havock; and attend The statesman who applauds the warrior-dead, And proudly bids the living thus expire For airy fame!—Not so the gospel trains The obedient passions; stealing from the scene Of military pride the humbled soul— Turning from perishable wreaths, its aim To fadeless crowns! Not so the gospel soothes The funeral anguish! To the legends turn Of classic fiction. Say, can pagan draughts Of Tartarus or elysian skies, affect The penetrated bosom, like the word That sounds its awful sanctions, echoing back The native feelings?—Ah, thy cold assent Yet hesitates amid Virgilian bliss Or Plato's splendid vision! Unobserv'd The scripture's venerable page unfolds Its chaste simplicity of dress: For thee Vainly the too familiar lesson flows, Couch'd under beauteous parables that mock All human mimickry. Each sacred truth From immaturest infancy hath play'd Around thine heedless ears—hence deem'd inert And vapid—or, too feeble to supply The stores of eloquence, and warn mankind. The listless lectures thou hast idly heard Strengthen the false idea. Thou hast seen The sable-stoled speaker (yet rever'd For unaffected sanctity) nod o'er Each freezing word. How lagg'd the heavy phrase! But ah! misdeem not inspiration's tome, Frigid and wearisome; nor such a strain The pattern of thy preaching, tho' the work Of sages, deeply vers'd in scripture-lore. O thou, commission'd from above, to lead An undiscerning multitude to life; Know, tho' thy active genius may have div'd Thro' all the depths of science; tho' thou pierce The gloom of darker history; tho' thy skill Discuss with perspicuity the points E'en of abstruser morals; tho' the sense Of holy writ, that puzzles oft the wise, Flow, to thy luminous conception clear; Vain are thy boasted talents, if the springs Of human conduct in familiar life— If living character ne'er met thy views. Read, then, mankind. Yet o'er the checquer'd scene Of manners, rove not long with curious search; Content to study the more simple race Ungloss'd by fashion's varnish. These, thy flock, A skilful shepherd, art thou call'd to guide Safe from the ravening wolf, o'er dreary heaths Where many a cavern threatens—over lawns Where bright luxuriance catches the pleas'd eye, And each voluptuous breeze wafts poison round. Of every audience, howsoe'er refin'd, Few are the polish'd, when compar'd with those By education's hand as yet unshap'd. And know, the vulgar have a mental strength Respectable tho' rude. They own a sense Of right and wrong, and mark the plainer lines That separate good and evil; yet observe, Not with the casuist's microscopic eye. With many a superstitious notion fraught Deadening the finer feelings, (if, perchance The finer feelings could, a moment, live Amidst the untutor'd populace), they nurse Credulity and prejudice so strong As ne'er to be destroy'd, but, full oft turn'd To salutary use. Of serious cast, They brood o'er dull opinions, and reflect With casual penetration. Tho' not slow To apprehend an obvious truth, they boast No quick vivacity. Thus they perceive Intelligent, but know not to pursue, With stress of mental faculties, a train Of argument, tho' evident its source, And tho' its ends perspicuous; since their minds Unform'd for reasoning by habitual use Are yet unexercis'd. Their momories aim With many a faultering struggle, to retain The substance of a short harangue, tho' clear Its few divisions as the unclouded light Of noon. Nor can they feel the kind address That moves the placid spirit of esteem, Or in pathetic union mingles pain And pleasure. Can they see the beauteous form Of represented virtue; or descry The character which, amiable and good, Exhibits only to the kindred mind Its own attractive beauties?—Can their eye Glisten thro' pity's tear, when eloquent In silence, penury lifts its hands, to ask Our aid?—'Tis true, benevolence inspires Our universal progeny; and prompts (If unalloy'd with interest) to relieve The wretched. Yet, by delicacy rear'd, Pity in sensibility alone Exists, refin'd and pure. Did e'er the crowd Foster that mild tranquillity, so ting'd By pensive thought, which gentle bosoms deem Their dearest luxury?—that religious warmth Which, at the still calm hour of solitude, Rises, a grateful sacrifice, effus'd From the full heart; while nature lives around In sweet accordance waving her deep groves, Pouring her founts, and breathing all her balms To heaven? These are emotions never known To the unmanner'd vulgar. Nor to meet A worthless object with contempt's cold frown, Or with fastidious dignity that comes From proud intelligence and cultur'd taste, E'er character'd their minds. But such thy charge, Young orator, joint candidate with thee For God's immortal glories. Know, they feel, (Tho' soften'd fancy, tho' the mellower train Of finely-mix'd affection be not theirs), They feel, in all its energy, the storm Of ruder passion. Riveted to earth, They stare blank admiration; beam forth love, Or scowl dark hatred; for approaching good Throb with desire; or, oft as ills draw near, Shrink with antipathy's collapsive shock, Spontaneous; glow with eager hope, or shake With fear's convulsing tremour; full of joy Exult, or sink in grief; smile gratitude (Tho' faint but in the liberal mind) or rage With anger! Their's is fancy too, amus'd By strong familiar images, not charm'd By the soft drapery of aerial forms. Not that with frequent impulse passion wakes Self-kindling, from their indolent repose, The unletter'd herd; while their quiescent minds The steady love of lucre sways—intent On temporal good, that actuates oft the wise. See, then, thy task. To point this common love Where brighter interest opens, by the strength Of their arous'd affections, be thy prime Ambition. What tho', scatter'd thro' the crowd In splendid interspersion, may appear A few more penetrating minds, that boast Superior station and superior taste; If they have human instinct, they shall feel— If they have yet a conscience, they shall fear The pure address from nature and from God. To manage such a multitude, affect No florid phrase, or curious periods smooth In measur'd sweetness; nor on airy wing Of metaphysics hover; nor abstract Into proud reason's maze perspicuous truths That, of a practical concern, admit No philosophic subtleties obscure. Nor, on too wide canvass represent The virtues and the vices: nor, in shape Of formal essay, be it thine to give Too general admonition, indistinct Ev'n as a distant prospect that attracts No eye. Thy office prompts thee to display The well-known paths of virtue in broad light; And by persuasion's energies compel Reluctant crowds to enter, and be blest. Ill it beseems thee, by ought strange or new To fascinate thy people. 'Tis a false Imposing eloquence. A few plain facts— A few plain tenets of the gospel-truth Adduce; and on thy auditors impress, With manly zeal: to speculate, were vain. But, grant, thy meaner audience may prefer The curious disquisition; be assur'd Thy subtle system suits not with a race Busied in occupations that admit No leisure for research. Still, knowlege grows An interdicted tree to touch profane. Behold the uneducated herd approach, And pluck the fruits. Lo! what a sudden change Portentous—as a casual glimmering, thrown Upon their mists of ignorance, stirs desire Too curious, and their prompt ambition moves To stray beyond the limits of their lot Thro' darkest avenues. The common cares Of life, and each domestic duty, deem'd Too low for an enlighten'd spirit, sink Scorn'd and forgone; while penury disarrays The hamlet's humble garniture, where, erst Trim neatness in her decent russet rang'd The simple stores, and spread on every cheek The ruddiness of health. Alas! no more His children overjoy'd spring forth, to meet A sire, whose never-erring footsteps cross'd The smooth-worn threshold, thro' the dews of eve; Whose vigorous toil sustain'd them, and whose smile Beam'd to content. Ah! shivering in the garb Of tatter'd want, they mourn, each lagging hour, A father lost; and wring their little hands, And, pining, droop for hunger! He, meanwhile, Estrang'd to every duty his own roof Had render'd dear, pursues a light he hails Heaven's pure effulgence—tho' a faint false gleam Of superficial knowlege, gendering pride And brainsick folly and fanatic zeal. Led by a lying spirit, he no more Listens, an humble hearer, but affects To teach the “multitude with itching ears;” While his distorted gestures (that affront The eye of day) and frenzied rant inspire The puritanic fear, or idle hope Wing'd above earthly cares. His whinning strain Boasts a familiar providence, that bids Assiduous ravens hover o'er the brook Where vacant saints expect the unfailing food. 'Tis thus the enthusiastic train disturb The peace of simple villagers; and rough In every mimic clown new WESLEYS rise. Such is the effect of knowlege, misapplied In scanty measure. And its shadowy shape— Its feeble semblance oft misleads the mind Thro' PYRRHO's mazes; where chaotic gloom Involves the blank creation, and each truth Swims but in airy phantom. Nor more rare, Hath superficial science puff'd the vain With infidel opinions, which assail Heaven's mysteries. Thus, from reasoning too refin'd Amid the sacred rostrum, hath the crowd Wrested the rudiments of erring faith, Or casuist doubt, or the cold deist's dream. Alas! while difficulties such as these Obstruct the preacher, who would undertake But with full many a fear, the preacher's task? Who would attempt, but with a tremulous hope Misgiving oft, so arduous an emprize?— Alas! for him, who with rude hand awakes To solemn numbers the didactic lyre, What but sincerity, that fearless trusts To its own conscious feelings, could excuse These efforts, all too feeble? Yet he grasps, Tho' weak his powers to execute, the sense Of what is great and glorious; and, perchance, Sees, in his art, the principles that form A perfect model. Nurtur'd in the seat Of academic ease, he there imbib'd The love of sacred wisdom; tho' the muse Of Siloa, uninvok'd, inspir'd not then His song. But in those avenues that erst O'erarch'd a BAGOT (proud to embower such worth— Such virtues in their venerable shade) There, musing oft on future scenes, he form'd The prospect of ideal good—to flow From his impassion'd preaching. Nor unmark'd His decent fane, nor unreview'd his charge; That not at distance from his natal spot Beyond the woody Tamar, fancy trac'd; And, as she spread the glowing tint, it seem'd No fairy picture: for young hope reliev'd With golden rays each figure fancy drew. 'Twas then, with honest independence flush'd, Oft would he cry: “Ye visions, tho' so fair, “Perhaps ye promise vainly! For, the mask “Of dark deceit, too often worn for you, “Shall never hide one generous feeling! Far “From this untainted bosom be the lure “That leads thro' flattery's maze the cringing crew. “If my sincerer aims be frustrate all; “Whilst the corrupt, the versatile ascend “To rich preferment thro' the path whose dust “I would disdain to tread—or, treading, shake “Indignant from my feet; if every wish “Urg'd by no mean ambition, should arise “Unsanction'd; then, not sorrowing, would I hail— “Then would I hail thy bowers, paternal seat, “Where I might yet retire, and “eat my bread “In privacy and peace.” There might I rest, “My slumbering hopes of honor undisturb'd “By those who, prone to adulation, pour “With a deceitful smile the cold applause!— “Happy (the hollow sycophant unknown “To those pure shades) as there, where dawning age “First weav'd its wayward fancies, I review “Thro' the dim veil of years, each mellow trace “Of childish joy and youthful bliss serene. “There, where the veteran umbrage of the beech “O'erhangs the cressed brook, that gurgling laves “Its wreathed roots, or the long-waving limes “Have darken'd their broad shadows, may I oft “Attune the pastoral song; or, pondering o'er “The ruthless times when CROMWELL's hosts opprest “My loyal fathers, hail in many a tone “Pensive and deep, the visionary forms “Of ancestry, that with majestic air “Swim by the moonbeam, thro' the glimmering trees.” Such his fond thought: and may his heart retain Its youthful fires. But tho' the willing muse His sacred labors may relieve, and chase With a benign serenity, the gloom Which settles on the melancholy brow; Never may indolence inspire the dream That, first, in a delicious languor creeps Thro' the dissolving frame, yet gives it o'er To qualms and ceaseless heart-akes! Then return Ye hopes, fair-promising, that only wing The soul to vigorous action! Then return The preacher's energetic toils!—And, come Digressive muse, to note them as they rise. SINCE, pupil, crouding difficulties dash Full oft the preacher's efforts, waken all Thy faculties; and, ruminating deep Upon the temper and the affections mark'd In thy plain auditory, think, how best Thy skill may rule them, by the genuine style— The genuine air in pathos only seen. Then deem not (as my previous strains have taught) Religion, a cold metaphysic form, Musing o'er moral problems, and confin'd To wisdom's eyes alone—behold, she sits, While faith unveils her to the vulgar gaze, Streaming cherubic effluence o'er her heaven Of spotless azure! To the dazzling light Her everlasting robe, the asbestos floats In vivid folds. Around her emerald throne The passions tremble at her awful beck— “Her ministers as flaming fire,” to waft Into the mortal bosom the pure spark Æthereal, that refines our thought! Hence fly The words that burn; while her impulsive power Imparts an oratory only less Than what inspir'd the apostles, when of old They spake all tongues, and saw confusion's reign, The curse of jarring Shinar, disappear. And lo! she hails her Albion as the spot Auspicious to her orators, tho', long, Unfriended; whilst, in other climes, the pomp Of tyranny and superstition frowns, Ungenial inmates; and in sloth supine Snores the dark priory, or proud conclaves vaunt Their hierarchal honors! Here the mind Shall rise unshackled, if too nice a sense Fastidious intervene not, to retard Its flights!—Here pathos may exert its powers. First therefore, to produce the pathos, fix Upon the great emotions of thy soul The mental eye; and deem thy hearers mov'd By similar sensations. Thus the case Of others may be accurately drawn From thine assenting heart that feels it true. Thus intimately versant in the soul's Quick movements, thou wilt never harshly treat What should be gently turn'd to virtue's road; Removing each obstruction that may bar Persuasion, and preparing every mind By lenient measures, ere thy art unfold Doctrines, whose aspect suits not worldly pride, Or idle vanity, or sensual care. Free to receive thy lessons, shall the heart Attend them, unrevolting. Then affect, And in repeated agitation keep, By thy displays of sacred truth, the race Of passion; which, attemper'd into shapes Resembling scarce their former guise, and held In close engagement, rarely shall relapse Again imbruted, amid earthly things. Meantime thy style familiar, that alludes With pleasing retrospect to recent scenes, Shall interest every bosom. With the voice Of condescending gentleness, address Thy kindred people. Shun the distant air, The formal: shun the flippancy too smooth, The lightness too theatrical; the starts That waken for awhile the listening ear, But waken to antipathy. Be warm, Yet grave: unite an animated soul With dignified demeanor; and, untouch'd By the vainglory that on HEROD beam'd A momentary rapture, big with death, Preach not thyself; but nurse an ardent zeal As for thy offspring rang'd below! The fire Of exhortation haply may diffuse Thy piety, thy virtues; as they see The emotions of a parent. But beware Of overacted violence, that turns To ridicule the best-imagin'd strain. The pulpit-speakers that arose to fame, Ere Britain from asperities had clear'd Her language, opening to thee ample stores For eloquence, may cool the intemperate warmth Of passion: but the pulpit might in vain Adopt their manner. Idly might a SOUTH His witty turns—his quaintnesses display, Except to waken laughter. BARROW's style, Redundant and involv'd, would soon oppress Thy auditors: even TILLOTSON's were cold, Tho' thick with oratorial beauties sown; And CLARKE's exactness, rigorous and precise, Might vainly torture the protracted thought No—to thy observation—to thy heart Recur; nor ever slight them: and, now vers'd In nature and religion, fix thy choice Upon the topics that may best enforce The moral sense, instil into the soul The christian spirit meek, and mend the heart. If to the moral system we restrain Our search, select such topics as are sure To suit thy various audience. To one point That turns on age or station or the modes Of character, thy apt discussions guide Unvarying. Many a preacher wanders wild O'er human life; exhibiting his draughts Confus'd and transitory—to distract The attentive eye, that with vain gaze pursues. Is youth thy subject?—Fix'd within the pale Of youth, delineate its peculiar bent— Its failings, its affections; in full strength Shew its appropriate duties; and address The young around thee with the feeling tones That speak the guardian father and the friend. Or, on the duties of maturer years Descanting, rove not with digressive wing. But still to thy selected topic true, Trace the hoar lineaments of tremulous age Dropping into the grave. Trite is the tale Of mortal frailness; but the gloomy truth Yet interests and affects: and what affects Will influence. For, tho' oft the passions, rous'd By vivid strokes of the pathetic, glow With but a momentary flush, and faint Full fast away; still something at the heart Lingers in feeble pulses inextinct, That quick recurs to conscience, at the hour Of meditated evil: the weak sense By oratorial energies renew'd, Acquires an active vigor to repel The power of vice. The pictur'd frown of death Hath ev'n awak'd from lethargies of sin The sluggard soul; and bade it trembling fly The horrors that enwrap the yawning gulph. Nor seldom, stealing with familiar strain Into his business and his bosom, paint The poor man's lot; whilst in the house of God The virtuous peasant shall beside the peer Stand forth, embolden'd. Tell him, if the glow Of floating purple shade o'erweening pride, His is the better livery that infolds The limbs of want: and tell him, tho' his hours Of still devotional repose are few, If pious meditation shall await His steps into the field, the humble vow Breath'd from amidst his labors, may ascend The purest incense that embalms the skies. Thus it behoves thee to inspect with care Life's shifting circumstance. The social ties, The duties that reciprocally bind The human race, shall in strong light appear Link'd with peculiar stations. Tho' alike “The tender charities of father, son, “And brother,” interest all our mortal race; Lovelier shall they attract the poor, if drawn Beneath the straw-roof'd dwelling, or the rich, If shadow'd in the splendor of the dome. And human character with no vain force May arm thy eloquence. Its simple forms Shall strike the rude spectator, and excite The conscious feelings. But the draught refin'd Rarely the vulgar apprehension meets, Tho' well thy pencil's mimic powers it prove. Here may the historic instance give effect To moral portraits. From the sacred fount Bring forth the forcible example. Show The grey BARZILLAI's honourable age Placid, tho' to the minstrel's warbled voice— To the sweet meltings of luxurious lutes No more awake! Shew HEZEKIAH frail In human weakness, and still asking life! Shew saintly TIMOTHY, tho' young, detacht From sensual joys. Exhibit LAZARUS poor— Arimathean JOSEPH rich, yet proud To bear the christian banner! And describe The trembling FELIX! Such as these beseem Thy pulpit oratory, opening tracts Recent in various beauties; where the heart Throbs with the keen emotions of delight Or fear; and (as the obedient memory stores The striking incident) beats every pulse In corresponding tones to nature's sense; Till, sudden, by an unexpected stroke At once discover'd to itself, it sees Its every winding avenue; shrinks back From its detected vices, (never view'd Before, but with a transitory glance), And shudders at the brood it fosters there. If, in the christian system, we behold The radiant sun of righteousness arise With healing in its wings—to stream forth light Upon the sterner virtues, to relume By pure effulgence mild the moral world; 'Tis here pathetic eloquence shall greet Prospects at which ev'n paradise might fade, Tho' all its bowers hung blooming to the breath Of innocence!—'Twas Eden's happy pair Announc'd creation's blessings. But here burst, Ineffably benign, redemption's rays, Whilst in a mute amaze archangels hail The infinitude of mediatorial love! Here shall thy glowing oratory charm With an unwonted lustre, as it meets The meekness of the christian—his calm eye Wet with the tear of gratitude! To prove Religion's firmly-rooted truths, by long Elaborate deduction, were to freeze That feeling tear! The unfathomable strain The vulgar may admire: but not with breath More idly eloquent, the sainted sage Gather'd around him on the rocky shore The scaly race that cleave the hoary deep. Insist not, therefore, with a tedious length, On proofs external. The strong leading facts Concisely representing, quickly bring The internal evidence to light, that strikes Conviction while it sinks into the heart. Faith is, perhaps, thy topic. Ah beware Of mazy ambiguities too dark For letter'd minds. Attempt not to premise The jarring tenets of innumerous sects; But in perspicuous enarration touch The important theme. Clear argument may rise In short succession: yet the historic draught Shall occupy attention's stedfast soul. The weak apostle's unbelief; his doubts Quick into faith resolving; the despair Of tortur'd JUDAS, who in bitter shame— In the black writhing of remorse exclaim'd, “I have betray'd the blood of innocence”— These are the potent instances sublime That best become thy subject and thyself; The bold examples that command belief; The judgment and the passions at a stroke Convince and move; repel with wond'rous force The skeptic's rebel reason; and inform The meanest intellect with instant light. And should repentance be thy plainer theme, Discourse not in too general terms that fix But feebly on the memory. Show its powers As instanc'd by the roving son, who fled With sorrow, from the harlot's treacherous smile To his glad father's bosom. If thy speech The stronger passions shall address, behold The everlasting gospel brings to view, Amid the horrors of the spreading gloom Miraculous, a dying Saviour nail'd Upon the cross, while in the midst is rent The temple's veil; and the pale vaults resign Their dead! Behold, the gospel blazons forth The dissolution of a world in flames; Pictures the bloody sun; the rushing spheres, The elements that melt with fervent heat; Portrays the throne of judgment and the crowds That meet their doom eternal—some ingulph'd In fiery depths sulphureous; others high Among the saints, and crown'd with starry light. These be thy topics—thy sententious phrase With each variety of figures fraught That heighten the pathetic; while exclaim The affections in apostrophes; suspend Attention by the well-tim'd pause; contrast The bold-drawn imag'ry; or break away, In all the abruptness of transition, wild. Thus, whilst thy pulpit-oratory lives In nature, scripture echoes to its strain; Whether the cheerful or serene shall flow, Or the devout in feeling beauty breath'd, The sorrowful, the joyous, the sublime. And lo! the oration model'd by the rules Of beautiful arrangement, shall despise The studied air—the mechanism that marks A chain of subdivision. Every part Shall coalesce with ease; nor passion wait Invariably, the peroration's call. Such is the manner only, that becomes The pulpit. And it strikes with double force, While dignified demeanor, and a sense Of duty in the unerring conduct shewn, And fatherly affection never damp'd By low pursuits of lucre, o'er thee spread The sunshine of sincerity. Can they, Whose inconsistent lives not rarely seem A very contrast to the truths they preach, Reform the general morals?—When the light, The volatile, the modish churchman mounts The hallow'd rostrum with an airy step That rivals ev'n a Vestris' ease, and casts His careless glances on the pews below, What are his bosom-feelings? Sure, one pause, One little pause the vanities resign To serious thought; as to his distant home Retiring from Augusta, he yet deigns To visit, for awhile, his vagrant charge. Alas! he scarcely knows (nor strives to know) His blunt unfashion'd people; but to all Bowing with graceful condescension, pays An undistinguishing regard; then flies (Delighted that his tedious task is o'er) Back to the scenes, while, hailing his approach, Soft pleasure strews the rosy couch, and clasps, Familiar, the fond votary to her arms! And say, tho' yonder bloated priest may lead Far from the city-smoke his rustic hours; In the rude science of the chace alone A finish'd master, is it not his joy (All duty superseding) to direct The clamourous pack; or quaff the mellow draught Of brown October; or by many an oath Proclaim his manly daring to a mind Congenial with his own; e'en while he stoops In fulsome adulation to caress His patron, who with benefices, fat And flowing as the land of Israel's hope, Repays the homage of the fawning slave? Yet, not the brightest character that trusts To its own genuine worth, nor borrows aid From circumstance exterior, can o'erawe The servile multitude; obsequious they, Where adventitious consequence, conferr'd By wealth alone, corroborates the force Of fair example. Oft hath merit mourn'd The transient influence of its duteous toils, And droop'd unheeded in the sickly shade! There too, submitted to its humble sphere, The mind, that might have sprung aloft, sinks down In feeble acquiescence; never more To exert the native powers of freeborn man. 'Tis thus the caged lark, denied to soar Amidst the orient's kindling light, and dip His pinions in the morning-tinctur'd cloud, Yet pecks the verdure of his little turf, Within his narrow bound, content and tame! Haply, the pittance of a cure is thine, The seat of rough rusticity, retir'd From garish opulence. Even here, thy words Tho' stamp'd by truth and pathos, and the weight Of thy unblemisht conduct, shall impel Not always with an unresisted power The crowd to virtue's paths. But what avails Thy every effort with the vulgar crew, If, circled by the pleasures, and begirt By gorgeous pomp, a great one hath debauch'd Their groveling minds, and led them far from thee? Long by romantic Arun's stream was mark'd At little distance from a tuft of trees That half-conceal'd the steeple, a low roof, Where Villicus, a modest curate, past Full many a day—tho' unambitious, vex'd With griefs his spirit knew not to sustain; And, tho' assiduous in his office, check'd By feelings that might damp no trivial sense Of sacred duty. Ever was he seen A faithful pastor; whether the return Of Sabbaths call'd his oratory forth, (For he was eloquent as one instinct With heaven's own spirit), whether he was wont To join, on festivals, a scatter'd few In pious prayer, while each clear echo told The vacant pews; whether the wasting sick, Abandon'd by the help of man, implor'd The sweet consolatory balm that soothes The dying; or the last sad office claim'd His feeling tear that trickled at the sobs Of funeral woe, what time the evening sun Flung on the freshness of the new-turn'd grave A lingering beam. In admonition warm, Oft did he caution the too thoughtless tribes Against each sin that easily besets The heart; and oft, more anxious than their fires, Taught the surrounding innocents, who lov'd His friendly smile, the lesson to be good. Yet inauspicious were his fairest aims, While the degenerate villagers despis'd His fervid exhortation; wantoning oft Amidst the remnants of luxurious feasts, Where a contiguous mansion overbrow'd The curate's little hamlet. In that dome A lord (begotten, where the Ganges rolls, By murder on chicane) revell'd uncheck'd; Nor heeded the dull monitor within Which points to virtue. Prodigal, yet void Of any generous feelings, he pour'd forth A waste of wealth to feed the rich—the poor; Who, indistinguishably blended, caught The vices of his menial train, and spread The quick contagious profligacy round. Shameless amid lascivious ease, and lost In pleasure's fond delirium, he display'd His bosom-barlots to the wondering view Of rustics; or, enamour'd at a glance, Vow'd to the simple girl unblushing love! Nor strove he in God's hallow'd house (if there He sacrific'd to form an irksome hour) To check the look licentious, or the grin Of levity that, all irreverent, past Thro' mimic pews—ah, more infectious far Than chaste devotion's fire, effus'd by thee, Much injur'd Villicus! who, doom'd to meet The sneer of dissolute contempt, the taunts Of menial insolence, yet bending o'er Thy flock, wert wont with a presageful eye To mourn the spreading evil. And to mourn— To preach, were frivolous alike—thy breath Of eloquence as idle as thy tear! Thus, the once animated strain, too oft, Faints into feeble lecture: thus, the ties Of loosen'd duty languish on our hands, All interrupted; and we leave our charge, Care-worn. But Villicus, who brook'd not sin Tho' drest in fashion's colours gay, oppos'd Her glaring front with irretorted aim. Strong was his phrase and ardent; whilst the sight Of crouded aisles inspir'd new zeal. And still He toil'd; when, sudden the proud lordling's rage Dash'd his sincerest efforts by a power The wealthy feel—a power to crush the weak; And, wresting from his grasp the scanty dole Which unaffected duty had endear'd, Bade many a sycophantic tongue (that sounds A great man's echo) spread calumnious tales To tarnish with the aspersing taint his fame; Tho' al he preach'd was virtue, and his life Was but a comment on the truths he preach'd! Here, pupil, might we rest—the genuine vein Of pulpit-eloquence already trac'd— But let us mark occasions that may ask More argument or elegance than suits The multitude; and touching on the modes That in discriminated features shew Thy art, propose the models which may claim Thy just regard.—A learned audience loves, As Granta's, or as Rhedyeina's sons, Ev'n the polemic question. Not but there The champions of the theologic war Misplace their oratory. For, behold, Those hearers that await the preacher's nod In academic bowers, are, chief, the young, With fancy gay and vigorous. Doth the dry The strict methodic dissertation suit Their airy spirits?—Rather note the sting Of secret vice, exhort to study, point The prize of honor, and distinctly draw Virtue's fair outline. Yet, if thus alone The academic doctor err'd, the blame Were trivial to the censure that pursues His steps, as thro' Saint-Mary's ancient gate Wide-opening to the sable-vested sons Of Isis, he directs his way; to spread The dews of Morpheus. Few can Isis boast Vers'd in thy art! But many a fine discourse That, dull and clattering, from the pulpit fell, Flows from the press, a rich transmuted ore. Nor academic preaching where slow Cam Rests on its sedges the dark stream, exceeds The fame of Isis: and Augusta knows (Tho' there the affected, finical and smooth, May gain a fleeting plaudit from the slaves Of fashion) scarce an orator, to charm Discerning taste. Yet her forensic tribes Hath sacred eloquence delighted oft In elegant attire. The templar loves The truth not unadorn'd, pleas'd to relax His dry laborious studies; but suspects The appeal to passion. Stor'd with jests profane And fond to vaunt opinions that may wear A colourable speciousness, he meets With proud objection the thrice-hallow'd tome; Tho' he hath never op'd (by other cares Pre-occupied) the volume he decries! Point then his mind's acumen to the proofs Of revelation. O'er thy reasoning throw The robe of rhetorick. Not that ornament Should, here, invest thy topics with a glare Of superficial richness. Rather verge To SHERLOCK's plain compactness, that admits No decorating figures, than o'erload Thy lessons with the metaphor's crude mass. These, on a general survey, are the modes Of pulpit-oratory, which agree With no unletter'd audience. But in these (Where judgment or the lively fancy reigns Predominant o'er passion) genius bids The different mannerists attract the eye Of fame. Hence, by an easy process, slides The species into country-fanes—transcrib'd By mimic ignorance. What tho' HORNE may clothe His thoughts in beauteous metaphor, he knows To discipline his fancy—to command The heart; and by familiar accents move The christian soul! Say, what tho' PORTEUS strike By copious sentiment, condens'd and strong; Or graceful HURD may reason in a style Of elegant deduction, as a voice More musical than ATTERBURY's, holds The still attention; pathos best accords With common hearers; nor is misapplied Ev'n to the more refin'd. The statelier pomp Of high cathedral dignities may frown Upon the impassion'd period; and the pride Of science too pedantic may propose The closer method of the deep discourse, As the sole imitable mode. Yet say, Doth not the fane effuse its holy gloom O'er various minds, the polisht or unform'd In each gradation—o'er the gentle breast Whence unaffected sentiment aspires; Whence pure devotion's flame? Is there a heart Feels not the address from BLAIR; tho' strict, not dull, Impassion'd and yet temperate, tho' refin'd Yet rarely florid? Who but owns the charm As STONEHOUSE gives to sentiment new soul, From every fine inflexion of a voice Distinct and sweet? 'Tis thus thy art hath drawn Persuasion's genuine excellence and force From nature and the scriptures! These are thine These are already open to thy view In fair display! I see, auspicious youth, Thy bosom kindle, as thy sacred guides Pass in array before thee! I behold Thine ardors mark a Saviour on the mount That mocks the rigor of the stoic porch, And his pathetic look on PETER cast, And his heart-breathing accents in the path To Emmaus, at dim eve! I see thee hail The martyr's angel-features, all illum'd By inspiration's lustre, while he bids Sublimest truths inform the unhallow'd ear!— I see thee turn to Lystra's prostrate tribes That fell astonish'd at the feet of PAUL, And, as the god of eloquence, ador'd The saint! I see thee trace him, at the throne Of the half-christian king; or midst the shrines Of Athens! And thine own exalted mind I see with transport glowing, as the powers Of BLAIR and STONEHOUSE meet—combin'd in thee! Thus then, (thy glorious mission duly view'd As of eternal moment) be it thine, Whilst other speakers, less rever'd, pursue Their own appropriate task, as erst my verse Instructed; whether at the learned bar Strict reasoning gain conviction; or the dome Of senates echoe to the embellish'd phrase; (Man's temporal welfare their inferior end); Be thine the nobler office to persuade By exhortation, fix in every soul Its fervor for the immortal scene, and point The path—tho' here thou walk, yet lent to earth, Thy heart establish'd in the bliss of heaven!

      <field name="fulltext">VOL. II. SIR ALLAN; OR, THE KNIGHT OF EXPIRING CHIVALRY. CANTO THE FIRST. ARGUMENT. 1. The Country-Gentleman of former Times.—2. Description of the Mansion-house, ruinous Castle, Gateway, &amp;c. of Andarton— of the Family resident at Andarton, from the highest Antiquity. —3. Sir Humphrey de Andarton, the present Possessor— his Character—his Wishes for a Son—Miss Prue his only Child—by his first Wife, Bridget—His Estates entailed on Miss Prue, in case of no Male Heir—Character of Miss Prue —Harriet, Sir Humphrey's second Wife—Rachel, his Maiden Sister—His Domestics, grown old in his Service. In elder days, when each manerial lord Cherish'd, with decent pride, the social board, Assiduous to support his old demesne, Where clustering hamlets spoke no sullen scene; The rich, the poor, with sparkling eyes survey'd The pure recesses of the patriarch-shade. And, lo! a scatter'd few, still fond to trace The fairer deeds that mark'd their quiet race, Blush not to boast the hereditary claim, But own their father's pomp, their proudest aim. Where glides the Fale, here spreading to the sun, There veil'd by clifts, or fring'd by coppice dun, On the hill side, of unaspiring height, A hoary mansion boasts its pleasant site; And where a woodbine-porch attracts the eye, Courts to its southern front the balmy sky. Soft from the porch a path, with easy flow, Steals down the slope, to kiss the bank below, Where gentle Fale the greensod loves to lave, Or curls thro' breathing tufts its amorous wave; While the tower-pinnacles, for ages grey, Frown o'er the church thro' many an elmy spray, And from the curate's thatch and whiten'd walls Across the silent stream the shadow falls. On grounds above the mansion-site, we mark A shatter'd castle crumbling o'er the park: Its ivy-curtain to the zephyr heaves, As mountain-ashes dance their airy leaves, And, ere their vermeil berries they unfold, Festoon the roofless wall with wreaths of gold. Lo! as assail'd by Charles's murderous foes, In firm defiance still the rampires rose; Sterner amid the storm the castle stood, To drink, at all its loopholes, rebel blood; Till, entering every breach to crush a host Beneath the fragments, was its haughty boast! Rais'd from the castle-stone, the mansion owes To the fall'n fabric its columnar rows Fantastic, once in beauteous order light, Its roof plain-vaulted, once with fretwork dight, Its doorway's pointless arches, and its panes Yet dimly tinctur'd with armorial stains; Whilst her fond antiquaries Fancy wafts From wreathed windows high to clustering shafts, Midst all the tracery which adorns a dome That frowns, superbly rich, in Gothic gloom. Beyond the ruin, rock'd by every gale, A gateway seems its solitude to wail, As, in unbroken grandeur wild and lone, Its turrets to the castle fragments moan; Whence a dark avenue, by time embrown'd, With its diffusive umbrage sweeps the ground, Guides, in fair perspective, the pleasur'd eye To poppied cornfields redd'ning to the sky; To vallies blooming midst their orchard shade, Or where tall hops their pendent blossoms braid; And to the aërial azure that invests The soften'd whiteness of the clifts, and rests A deep'ning haze, on two umbrageous knolls Between whose parted gloom the billow rolls. Far branching from the loftier avenue, A woodwalk, roof'd with laurel, leads the view, As roses blush, and purpling lilacs swell, And jasmines twinkle, to a cottag'd dell; Where, to the left, a wood its foliage flings, And little spaces gleam with fairy rings, Thro' the smooth stems of limes or beeches seen, To lure the fancy to their softer green. Meantime, the mansion rears no feeble roof On moorstone from the ruin, massy-proof; While, stretcht along the western wing, its hall Wooes a dim chesnut to the pannell'd wall, Bids the broad foliage o'er the wainscot play, And weave its quiv'ring shades with purple day. Here muskets gleam in many a steely row, With bayonets and pistols rang'd below; Swords that of human blood ne'er knew the guilt, And hangers glittering from each silver hilt— How valueless, amid the veteran fame Of armour that superior pannels claim; Vizors high burnisht once, as glory play'd Around the leaders of the wild crusade; The rusted cuirass, and the dinted shield; Bows that perhaps were bent on Cressy's field; Hauberks that clasp'd, where furies urg'd their work, Lancastrian heroes, or the chiefs of York; And targets, crusted deep with sanguine scales; And sable casques, that sigh to rifted mails. And not the hall alone, array'd with arms, Of other times renew'd the heroic charms. Glimmer'd above the hall, “the golden room,” Where mantled in the dance the virgin's bloom; While a long gallery, on its eastern side, Projected picture-shadows, far and wide; And with a portrait of the castle-dome Adorn'd, still serv'd to foster thro' the gloom Which gathers o'er an ancient house decay'd, The pride of worthies wedded to the shade. So stands the dome; screen'd safely from the north By elms that pour the rook's hoarse murmur forth: And, at small distance from the social trees A broad pond gleams, and dimples to the breeze; The wholesome cresses on its border feeds, And hides it's wanton carp with shading reeds. Amid these grounds, a race of spotless name, Not trump'd by glory, or unknown to fame, Their rural lives in calm succession pass'd, And saw good days, and peaceful breath'd their last. Not that each worthy, tho' unstain'd by crimes, Escap'd the modish errors of the times: Yet, each descending to his father's vault, His sin was soften'd to a trivial fault. That, her High Chamberlain, the bearded Hugh Serv'd Queen Matilda, is as gospel true: That, once, at Henry's court, the sly Sir Watt Was Wolsey's friend, allur'd by Wolsey's hat, Yet, when the Cardinal dispurpled fell, Stole to these shades, the village stories tell; And that, in bigot Mary's reign, the shire Sir Edmund serv'd, as Knight, is passing clear. But none had scorn'd the endearing sweets of home, Or roam'd to distant shores, or wish'd to roam; Save that young Ralph, illustrious in the fight, At Salem's glittering towers, a red-cross Knight, Had the proud crescent from the rampires torn, And stern o'er hills of slain the trophy borne. Yes! happy still their home-brew'd ale to quaff, (Spite of the exotic prowess of Sir Ralph) A train of honest Knights and honest Squires Were laid in quiet slumber with their fires; When every villager aspir'd to hail Sir Humphrey, lord of all the tranquil vale, And not less meriting his fathers praise, Tho' “fall'n on evil tongues and evil days!” Tho' now, alas! arriv'd at sixty-one, Yet was the Knight ungifted with a son: Still for a son he breath'd the fervent prayer; But all his ardors were dispers'd in air. Twice in the roseate chain of Hymen linkt, Love on the gentle captive archly wink'd, As to a second charmer he resign'd, In dreams of sweet oblivion, all his mind. Yet oft his Bridget, nipt in early bloom, His grief still follow'd to the untimely tomb. “But why lament her loss; while, far aloof, “While, hovering at due distance from my roof, “At best with cold civility I treat “Her friends that once annoy'd my peaceful seat?— “That pallid sister, who now mocks the skies, “Lifting the whites of two grey-gogling eyes;— “That meagre brother, an air dancing prig, “Like Jenny Jerkairs, in heroics big “If at the sessions he hath gain'd a cause “By the smart action of his lanthorn jaws, “But, on a sudden, how submiss and mute “If his nose suffer in some sharp dispute!” Thus o'er the past Sir Humphrey lov'd to brood, Then look'd to future views in fretful mood; As, overweening still, his wish would run, “O may kind Heaven indulge me with a son!” One girl was his, just verging on eighteen— O well might he prefer that prayer, I ween! A present from his first devoted wife, The girl might soothe, indeed, the cares of life, If, haply, formal pride and sullen airs, And flippancies, of life relieve the cares. Tutor'd amidst a modish school, whose boast Was to amuse conceited heads, at most, And not one salutary truth impart, Such as informs the mind, or mends the heart; Miss, with a hatred for her home, came down, And term'd each rural squire a booby clown! Attacht to things that Misses deem outré, A shrub imported from the Southern Sea, No matter what—a Transatlantic weed, Or any creature not of British breed, She, by her sire's indulgence, prompt to grant Her wishes, purchas'd many a curious plant; While with Bologna's lapdog soft supplied, Her soul, unsated, for a monkey sigh'd; And, with the prating of a parrot blest, The paroquet her longing hopes carest! From taste in reading still she wander'd wide, Follow'd the laws of fashion, her sole guide; With thoughts that petrify, and words that freeze, Turn'd o'er a page, and talk'd of Eloise; And said, that English writers of romance Stole every touching grace from genial France. Of France, indeed, enamour'd, she resign'd To one sole favourite of the human kind, A maid from Caen imported, every care; (Unless a school-creole might claim a share) As with the choicest Gallic tropes she strung, In converse with the chattering girl, her tongue; For genuine wit receiv'd each flippant jest, While dear Annette herself or Tripsey drest; And, from the vulgar English herd withdrawn, Enjoy'd the native eloquence of Caen. Yet, if the Knight begat no issue male, His whole inheritance was hers in tail. But, fond to give his heritage some chance, Or won (as some suspect) by beauty's glance, He kneel'd to Harriet, ere nine moons were past Since his first wife, his Bridget, breath'd her last. And well, ye Muses! might a form so fair, Those easy gestures, and that modest air— The harmonies of elegance and love, The pliant bosom of Sir Humphrey move; While o'er her sweet, her prepossessing face, The shadowy eyelash cast a pensive grace; While all the worth that feeling—sense supplies, Play'd in divine succession from her eyes. There, mild complacence held it's sober seat; There, gentleness illum'd its lov'd retreat; There Prudence sat, and, e'er deciding right, Reflected on calm thought a steady light. Now quick intelligence, in many a blaze, From those bright orbs elicited its rays! Now, in a sweet transition, would appear Pity! the trembling lustre of thy tear! Yet never could the admiring gaze excite In that pure breast one flutter of delight, While with those charms humility combin'd, To crown the beauteous triumph of the mind. But, oft, such virtues, as in lovely light They rise, in contrast with demoniac spite, Tho' Fancy bid them brighten thro' the gloom, Draw Envy's venom'd breath, to blast their bloom. “Shall you (the girl once cried, with loosen'd rage) “Whose arts have won my father's doating age, “Who, ere my hapless mother had been dead “For nine short months, approach'd the widow'd bed; “Shall you assume the housewife's serious task, “And duties that a long experience ask? “Shall you, who know not what the fashions mean, “Direct, in dress, a lady of eighteen?” Yet gentle Harriet of the household-care Bore, with becoming grace, a trivial share; And seldom to Miss Prue, tho' all confess Its studied stiffness, dropp'd a hint of dress. Meanwhile, a maiden sister of the Knight, Perverse, but rarely gloom'd by spleen or spite, Who from Andarton's smoke had never stray'd, The household with a high dominion sway'd. Rachel, in truth, a notable old dame, To thriftiness preferr'd the proudest claim; Whether her menial train she lov'd to treat With barley-meal proportion'd to their wheat; Or trick'd the government, so keen and arch, By the nice conduct of potatoe-starch; Or, to œconomy a constant friend, Each night collected every candle-end. But, in her charities good Rachel, still, Discover'd to the world her wondrous skill. With her what nymph could vie, ye hamlets! say, In treacle-posset, or in cyder-whey? O tell what dame with Rachel could compare Her poppy-syrops, or her maidenhair? Of all the sins that sue to be forgiven, Imploring mercy from relenting Heaven, She rated fornication far the worst, A sin she judg'd unnat'ral and accurst: Yet would she pity, of her wrath beguil'd, The poor frail Jacobite who prov'd with child. Sir Humprhey could, himself, but ill discard To the fall'n Prince the family-regard: And, if he warmly had espous'd a cause, Her brother's notions were, to Rachel, laws. Not but she screw'd her visage up, at first, And her parch'd lips, 'tis rumour'd, somewhat purs'd, When brother own'd, again by Cupid smit, That his teeth water'd for a fresh tid bit. And often with a shrewd or mystic look, Amid her household train her head she shook; When their first mistress, hurried to the tomb They mourn'd, and shudder'd at the haunted room. “'Tis now five years, and coming six, (they cried) “Since last we saw the room where mistress died: “And, sure we are, that chamber, every night, “Is sadly troubled by some wandering sprite! “Such noises oft we hear, such hideous moans— “Our flesh seems ready to forsake our bones! “Heaven grant no mischief may befall our lord, “But untold blessings croud his bed and board!” And warm their wishes! In his house grown old, Their's was the faithful heart unbrib'd by gold! The merry butler was alert to tell (A parish-prentice, he remember'd well) “How for young master Humphrey, who was born, “Beneath some lucky star, on Twelfth-day morn, “While round the roast they all were drencht with sack, “The great gold chain hung glittering to the jack! The groom, his head besprent with silver grey, Wish'd, with arch looks, for such another day: The simple hind petition'd from the heart, That master yet might play a vigorous part; And Avice, bending now beneath fourscore, Half smiling, nodded to the wags—encore! Alas, poor Avice! tremulously weak, Who with a palsied tongue essay'd to speak Her honest feelings, as she told with glee, How she had dandled oft the knight upon her knee! Poor Avice! who once dar'd, indeed, to chide Miss Prue's increasing petulance and pride; Yet now, perhaps, presuming to beseech The girl, with all humility of speech, To check her sullens, was with scorn repaid— Nay, by the blackness of her scowl dismay'd, Not for a world, would venture Miss to meet, If aught befel the plants or paroquet! But tho' her humour seldom Avice hit, Yet Avice pardon'd every sulky fit; Each prayer with wishes for her welfare clos'd; And, as a little brother (she suppos'd) Might from the suds relieve the vapourish maid, Unceasing, for a little brother pray'd. “Alas! (she cried) on this poor feeble knee, “My master have I dandled oft with glee— “O! in a son (she utter'd with a sigh) “His image may I dandle, ere I die!” END OF THE FIRST CANTO. CANTO THE SECOND. ARGUMENT. 1. The Guardian Genius of the House of Andarton convening the inferior Spirits—apprehensive of some impending evil—assigning to the Feri their different Stations in the Protection of the Family, &amp;c. &amp;c.—2. Sir Humphrey's private Life—Rachel's Occupations—Harriet's—Miss Prue's—Twelfth-Day, on which Sir Humphrey was born—Sir Humphrey, &amp;c. in public—At Church—Herbert the Curate—Sir Humphrey, a Justice of the Peace—Ned Jerkairs, his Clerk.—3. Harriet's Pregnancy—Birth of a Son, Allan-de-Andarton. Such was the household of Andarton-Grove, A patriarchal tent, sustain'd by love, Where all (but one) delighted to impart The bliss that springs from harmony of heart; When now the spirit, who with guardian sway Had watch'd Andarton from its earliest day, Glanc'd thro' the glimmering park at fall of eve, And, as the duskier wood began to heave With universal tremor, sought the roof Of a fair oak, whose leaves were knit, star-proof— An oak whose acorn in the genial earth Sir Humphrey's father, at his infant's birth, Had duly set, and round it smooth'd the green, And trimm'd the neighbour trees, an ambient screen. There, as beneath its arborous boughs he stood, He smil'd upon the pride of all the wood. The genius mus'd; while, towering on his head, A helm appear'd, with Paynim carnage red. Sudden his potent wand he wav'd around, And fleeting shadows brush'd the chequer'd ground; When, gathering in aërial squadrons, shone The inferior spirits, that his empire own— The Feri, who had lent their magic aid, Thro' ages, to protect Andarton's shade. “Ye Fayes, (he cried) by whom that ancient wood, “By whom, firm-rooted, those stout oaks have stood, “To whom these beeches owe their circling shade, “By whom those elms, rich-tufted, are array'd; “To you, ye Fayes, the important cares belong “To guard the parent-trees, to rear the young. “Ere wakes the foliage to the morning breeze, “Be yours to number all these precious trees, “Protect each scion, nurse the shrubs below, “And hover o'er the blossoms as they blow. “And ye, who give the fattening ox to feed, “Full-udder the fair kine, and guard the breed; “Bid o'er soft slopes the bearded barley flow, “Or wheaten furrows wave with golden glow; “Ah! summon, at this hour, your utmost skill, “To fence the farm and all its stores from ill. “What tho', when night hath all the scene o'erbrow'd, “And the pale Iris glimmers from her cloud, “Ye freely range, or haunt, as Oberon wills, “Far winding vallies, and translucent rills; “Yet is it yours, and Oberon's, to obey “This wand, and tremble at superior sway. “And you, domestic Feri, full of mirth, “By whom the chirping cricket glads the hearth, “Who, at the plenteous board, good-humour shed, “And pour sweet influence o'er the genial bed;— “Still with benign assistance hover near, “And deem not I indulge an idle fear. “I mark some ill—but, ah! the Immortal shrouds “Its features in impenetrable clouds! “Then, all ye spirits! watch these sacred groves; “Cherish their generous lord, and speed his loves.” He said, and wav'd his wand; when every Fay Dissolv'd, as at the kindling blush of day. Thus foster'd by the favor of the sprite, Thy grove, Andarton! bower'd its worthy Knight. There, of his ancient park, his pastures proud, He hail'd the summer-sun, the winter-cloud; Content to run the farmer's annual round, Monotonous, amid his native ground. When vernal breezes fann'd the waving shade, Ere with the morn his starry curtains play'd, He hasten'd to salute the balmy dawn, And by the path's alluring softness drawn To the hill-summit, caught the skylark's note That from a heaven of amber seem'd to float; Or listen'd to the wood-dove's tale of woes That, gurgling, from the impervious dingle rose. Yet not to lonely pensiveness inclin'd, He lov'd the cares that wait the watchful hind. Oft, as he grasp'd his silver-mounted staff, (A palm-tree branch transmitted from Sir Ralph— A branch that, with its dates delicious crown'd, Sir Ralph himself had cut on Salem's ground) He pac'd the broom-clad upland, or the glade, To “tell his tale” of sheep, or track the stray'd; Mark the young daisies, as, with half a smile, They faintly peep'd thro' fescue, or trefoil, And, kind in promise to the dairy-lass, Catch the first gleams where kingcups gild the grass. The sympathetic spirit hath averr'd, That human kindness draws the beast, the bird: And, goodness on his countenance portray'd, Each creature seem'd to court Sir Humphrey's shade. What tho' the hoop, too conscious of her crime, Where bursting buds announc'd the joyous prime, To other orchards from his presence fled, Ere long to forfeit her felonious head; Yet would the finch, with gold-streak'd pinions gay, With short shrill jerks salute him on his way, Plunge in the thistle her white bill, and shed Its glistening down, and rear her scarlet head, Sleek, on the spray above, her brightening plume, And with arch eye that confidence resume Which erst, amid the laurel glossy-leav'd, Her beauteous nest beneath his window weav'd. But, e'er, one tenant of Andarton-Grove Claim'd from the friendly. Knight peculiar love, The associate of his young and vigorous years, Whose honors, time-confer'd, awaken'd tears— His old roan horse, that, o'er his acres free, Stray'd, or by sunny hill, or shady tree, That own'd with pride, each faithful service past, A generous master's kindness to the last. The shaggy mane, the hoof with tufts o'ergrown, The toothless jaws, each rib a staring bone, Sunk in its socket the dim'd eye of glass, And knees that scarce sustain'd the tottering mass— Say, could the skeleton breathe vital air? Yes! memory, gratitude still linger'd there! If, in the mead or park he miss'd his Roan, The Knight, with fears confest by love alone, Would pierce the skirting thicket, or of thorn Or birch, tho' cover'd by the drops of morn, Then, chiding, as affection oft hath chid, Hail his poor friend, by holly-leaves half hid; While Roany hasten'd thro' the rustling shade, And to his prattling master fondly neigh'd! From Nature's hand accepting Nature's boon, Such hours of rural peace he pass'd till noon; When, from his walk return'd, in loose plaid gown, Oft times he welcom'd, from the neighbour town, The master of the razor and the puff, Who, scattering round a store of news and snuff, Now check'd his tongue, the foaming horn to swig, Now powder'd, in much haste, the bushy wig. Meantime, old Rachel would her charge resume, And observation dart, from room to room; The motions of her breathless housemaids watch, And from the tap'stry-chamber strait dispatch Their feet impatient, to the blue, the red, From the pal'd damask, to the new chintz-bed; Nor quit their heels, till now, their labour done, In each plump hand the nimble needle shone; When, keenly searching every dusty nook, She hied to form arrangements with the cook. Nor sooner were o'erpast her kitchen cares, Than her snug closet, half-way up the stairs, With a quick jerk she duly would unclose, In triumph tossing her red rivell'd nose; Thence, thro' a light of lattice, glances throw O'er all the kitchen, opening-wide, below; And shrewdly, tho' invisible herself, Mix in the bustle of each menial elf. Her room, indeed, was passing-dark, I ween, While, fading from a ground of rusty green, A tatter'd paper just disclos'd to sight Its old rais'd figures, once vermilion-bright. There, stood in shadow a moth-eaten desk; And there, a veteran cabinet grotesque, By some great aunt with filligree adorn'd, And a bare toilette, long as lumber scorn'd, Tho', rich-enamel'd, nigh the damask bed Its posies once a golden radiance shed. On shelves above were rang'd along the wall, To stimulate the stomach, or to pall, Pickles or green or red, and potted meats, And sparkling syrups, and confection-sweets, And many a gallipot of rich conserves, And jaleps, and still-waters for the nerves, And, fit for Falstaff's self, delicious sack, But chief, a large case-bottle of coniac. Full oft would Harriet a kind wish impart, To aid the housewife in her various art. But, cautious lest another should eclipse Her fame in crust, in mangoes, or in hips, Still as her various art the housewife plied, Her boast “in crowds, her solitary pride,” Untroubled each indulg'd her different taste; And Harriet read, while Rachel rais'd her paste. And Harriet bade the pencil's magic power Fling radiance, gilding many a gloomy hour; And, if her pensive bosom own'd a grief, Sought, in her dulcet harp, the sure relief. Yet she could e'er disperse the cloud of thought With music by applauding seraphs brought; While o'er each village, with a kind concern, Prompt every tale from sorrow's lips to learn, 'Twas hers, her cares, her pity to extend, The poor man's patroness, to all a friend. Oft, when along the avenue she seem'd To saunter, where the unfolding landscape beam'd, And gaze, as if its many-glancing hues She panted to her tablets to transfuse; She slop'd her path (yet still appear'd to stray) To the dim woodwalk, ting'd by dancing day; Trip'd lightly onward thro' its laurel gloom, And, heedless of the fragrance and the bloom, Quick, thro' its waving vista, caught the dale, And the sweet groupe of cots ascending pale; And now, by every curious eye unseen, With pleasure op'd the wicket on the green. There, as her hands the ready purse unstrung, She drop'd delicious accents from her tongue; And, more than with her purse (the poor confess'd) Cheer'd with that angel-voice the burthen'd breast; While the sad widow felt a genial glow, And left, half-told, the story of her woe; While feeble age, its crutch low-bending o'er, Forgot the pain it just had mourn'd before; And lisping babes, attracted by her charms, Stretch'd out, as she approach'd, their little arms. But chief, with tutelary care to guide A little cottage-school, was Harriet's pride. Where, on a hillock-slope, beside the wood, By rude oak-props sustain'd, a structure stood, And with an air grotesque o'erbrow'd the scene, Its thatch with moss, its walls with ivy green— While spir'd its smoke, or roll'd a dusky wreath O'er the dun hamlet in the dell beneath; There Harriet visited a veteran aunt, Who taught her imps the horn-book how to chaunt, Or how to knit, with azure yarn, the hose; High-spectacled her venerable nose! And, lo! at Harriet's voice, the pigmy crowd Start from their seats, saluting her aloud; When, as their several tasks they sing or say, No more they tremble at the birchen spray, But each, ambitious of a plauding look, Thumbs with new zeal his not unsullied book; When the hose-girls their flippant fingers ply, To steal approving glances from her eye. And tho' the magic of a smile could bribe To diligence, the sweet untainted tribe; Yet, little volumes, gilt, or green, or blue, And silver pennies, pleas'd attention drew; When, at the unhoped-for holiday high-flusht, Forth at her nod—their hats in air—they rush'd; Spread o'er the green, in various pastime gay, And bask'd and wanton'd in the sunny ray. Far other were the selfish Prue's pursuits, Amid her plants, her trinkets, or her brutes. If the clear morning wore a summer smile, The greenhouse might, perhaps, an hour beguile: Yet, as she shrunk, too sensitive, from air, Her visit to her costly plants was rare. When to her dressing-room Miss Prue retir'd, With the fond love of varying fashion fir'd; Incorrigibly formal, she betray'd An aukward imitation of her maid! Heavens! o'er her chamber what a rich display Of female frippery in disorder lay! Here combs of tortoise, elephant, or lead, There powders that ambrosial essence shed; Here patches, and pomatums, and perfumes, There friendly rouge, to bring back female blooms; And cushions stuck with many a black hair-pin, And night-gloves from some former Tripsey's skin; And brushes for the teeth, so ivory white; And two reflecting mirrors, burnisht bright; And letters freshly penn'd, where all her soul The girl had vapour'd to a swart Creole Her school-companion erst, whose grinning grace Had taught her how to prize the monkey race! In truth, her monkeys, her perpetual boast, By the good Knight's connivance, had engross'd The room that ran along the western wall, (Propt by the pillars of the extensive hall) That, by Sir Roger, her great grandsire, built, Was deck'd with sculpture and superbly gilt; The “golden room,” that once knew better days, When, lighten'd by the taper's midnight blaze, And by its cedar fires perfum'd around, It sprung elastic to the dancer's bound. Alas! where wreaths of fragrance gently roll'd O'er those dim pannels, once of burnisht gold, From cells assign'd to Tripsey's sweet repose, Odours, of other sort, assail the nose! Where, from the viol and the harp high-strung, With choral notes the copper ceiling rung, Far other sounds the wondering ear engage, Amid the proud orchestra now a cage! Here with long plumes macaws the floor o'ershade, Where birth-night ladies glitter'd in brocade! Here Prue with smart Annette a parley holds, Her monkey fondles or her parrot scolds; Where brilliant youths dissolv'd in amorous sighs, And courtly damsels roll'd their charming eyes! Ah! whether music melts, or dancing fires The social passion fades, and fast expires; Tho' once it kindled up the Baron's hall, And warm'd with equal rays the mud-built wall! While now the sounds of cordial union fail, Where the lone structure darkens every dale; While floats no more the voice of castled mirth, And scarce a cricket cheers the cottage-hearth; Each little neighbourhood may, perhaps, afford Some grave historian of its ancient lord— Some hoary peasant once a pamper'd groom, Who tells, with rueful air, the mansion's doom; Some gamekeeper, who now with drooping mien, Eyes his bare plush, alas! no longer green; And, as each feature various griefs distort, Regrets the sad cessation of the sport, While boys with fearless shouts around him run, And at mid day the poacher vaunts his gun— Perhaps some vicar, who, half-craz'd with care, Recounts the ruin of a thriftless heir, Pointing with signs that grief and pity mark, To his old patron's pale-dismantled park, Fell'd trees, where whispering airs no longer play, And dismal windows that exclude the day! Yet the good Knight still triumph'd to impart His own kind feelings to the mantling heart; When, 'midst the Autumnal or the Winter's feast, He deem'd the sum of human joy increast. In the gay circle of convivial cheer, Blithe Christmas came, with chaplets never sear: And chief, around his table, Twelfth-day drew The neighbours of the Knight, a social few; Cornubian cousins, all alert to pay A heart-felt homage to his natal day. Lo, for the last few years dispos'd to wear On this peculiar day the gloom of care, (As rose the morn) half-serious, half-in-joke, Sir Humphrey hail'd his coetaneous oak. “Each year (the Knight would cry), each year I see “Thy stem that argues a more vigorous tree; “Whilst I, my brother, am grown old and shrunk, “Full soon to wither, a poor sapless trunk!” But quick his open forehead from the eclipse Emerg'd, as squeezing hands and smacking lips, (To shame the hollowness of modish art) He smil'd on every neighbour from the heart. Nor sooner, at its chill and transient close, Had evening ting'd a dreary waste of snows, Than from the great plumb-cake, whose charms entice Each melting mouth, was dealt the luscious slice; As all the painted tapers in array Flung round the jovial room a mimic day, To wake to wonted sports the fancy wild, Where, e'en the greybeard re-assum'd the child. Yes! all—the gay, the serious—prompt to share The merry pastime, cried—avaunt to care! All—while each slip a forfeit would incur, (A slip that hardly left a lasting slur!) With the same ardor as when childhood dawns, Survey'd the accumulating store of pawns; And all enjoy'd, with eyes that rapture beam'd, The frolic penance that each pawn redeem'd— Perhaps, self-doom'd to ply the gipsey's trade, Or thro' the gridiron kiss the kitchen-maid, Or, by a gentle metaphoric trick, With cleaner lips salute the candlestick, Or catch the elusive apple with a bound As with its taper it flew whizzing round, Or, into wildness as the spirits work, Display a visage blacken'd o'er with cork. Meantime, the geese-dance gains upon the sight, In all the pride of mimic splendour bright; As urchin bands display the pageant show, In tinsel glitter, and in ribbons glow; And pigmy kings with carnage stain their path, Shake their cock-plumes, and lift their swords of lath; And great St. George struts, valorous, o'er the plain, Deck'd with the trophies of the dragon slain; And, thick where shiver'd lances strew the ground, A champion falls, transfix by many a wound, And little dames their favouring smiles bestow, And “father Christmas” bows his head of snow! Amid the quiet of Andarton's bower, So pass'd unsullied each domestic hour. Much to the public still Sir Humphrey ow'd: And, as his heart benevolently flow'd To patriot zeal, he paid the willing debt; Whether, at church, as Sunday came, he set A strict example to the vulgar train; Or, legal order anxious to maintain, Settled, an honest justice-of-the-peace, Parochial forms, and bade contention cease. Soon as the sabbath-morn began to break, Sir Humphrey would a dismal air bespeak; And teach his household thro' the day to wear, However borrow'd, the same dismal air. Yet, as instructed some mishap to rue, Tho' thus they strove together to look blue, And Rachel deck'd her visage with a gloom That seem'd to indicate the day of doom; Miss Prue, her ceremonies flung aside, A tribute to her independent pride, Took up a window-novel, degagee, And winc'd, and lolling prest the soft settee; Wonder'd how folks could indolently search For poor amusement in a cold damp church; And, as her sire began to talk of sin, Flew to her monkey with a sister-grin. Behold the frowning twain with painted poles, Those stern compellers of backsliding souls, Their coming master in the porch await; Prepar'd to drag to day, or soon or late, The soaking tribe, whom only canns of gin And Nantz more potent to devotion win. Sir Humphrey, bowing, pac'd the crouded aisle, And to the curate glanc'd a gracious smile; When now his short thick form from every pew The homage of an awed attention drew— When his large eye-brows that his eyes o'erhung, Dark on his Roman nose their shadows flung; As age with furrowing lines began to break The ruddy fullness of his healthful cheek; Tho' candour cloth'd his open forehead high, And mild good nature grac'd his hazel eye. Amid the varying service, he display'd The enthusiast's ardour, if the curate pray'd: Indeed, such fervid zeal Sir Humphrey felt, He stood himself, to see that others knelt; And look'd, as if his sight, as erst, were keen, On many an aunt the pillar'd rows between; Then, on pale monuments his eye repos'd, Fix'd his calm thought on beavers half unclos'd, His glance now upwards to the banners flung, While o'er his head the heavy gauntlet hung; Now seem'd to shiver down the steps that led To all the charnel horrors of the dead, And, as along the vault reflection ran, Mourn'd, with moist eye, the transient pride of man. Meantime the curate, with a modest port, Had gain'd the rostrum, ready to exhort, Perhaps on some fresh outrage to declaim, And spread on conscious cheeks the blush of shame. Certain it is, he oft dispens'd advice Season'd with much vituperative spice, Nor seldom to the gentler feelings spoke, And touch'd the bosom by a tender stroke. Yet, whether to a high censorial pitch He rais'd his voice in declamation rich, Or drew, by all the meltingness of tone, From careless youth a sigh, from age a groan; The Knight reports, he rarely was so rude As on the hour of dinner to intrude, But in good season, with a decent grace, Resign'd the preacher's for the chaplain's place. Yet was young Herbert not of supple mind, Tho', as Sir Humphrey lik'd, he preach'd or din'd. Not so the rector; whom, e'en once a year, Sir Huhphrey grudg'd the hospitable cheer; Who, as with courtly countenance he cring'd, The Knight's assum'd civilities unhing'd. “Tho' cheerfully I consecrate a goose, “(Spite of her cackling) to the curate's use, “And (sister grunting now) devote a pig; “Yet to that priest, with ostentation big, “Who, a proud prebend, once a year, salutes “His poor parishioners, the Cornish brutes, “I pay my composition with ill grace, “And make, at every shilling, a wry face. “'Zooks! he's a pastor only fit for Prue, “Who bridling up, as Swellum struts in view, “Curtsies, and spreads her fan, and talks with ease “Of lords and ladies, and such-like grandees. “Who, who can draw his purse-strings, nothing loath “For doctors of the ton that slight the cloth? “Indeed, 'tis lucky, that, of ancient date, “I plead a modus on my own estate.” At every innovation prompt to spurn, His law of modus he deriv'd—from Burn: And Burn he studied with incessant pains Till now his failing eyesight sav'd his brains. So qualified, the Knight would sally forth, A justice of the peace of mickle worth; His knowlege of the laws, each Woden's day, To brethren of the quorum to display; Snug at the Grey-goose all disputes compose, And with his grave companions dine or doze. There, if Sir Humphrey wander'd in the dark, Ned Jerkairs was at hand, his duteous clerk; And with adroitness to the legal way Would guide his worship tho' far gone astray, And, panting with hoarse eloquence, aver: “Sir, you have push'd ('tis my idea, Sir, “But I'll consult my brethren of the bar—) “Sir, you have push'd the matter much too far. “And, Sir, if you'll excuse a friend's advice, “(In points of law we cannot be too nice) “Perhaps, at intervals to cast your eye “On volumes that within my office lie— “The statutes, not abridg'd, Sir,—but at large, “Would fit you, your high duty to discharge. “For, tho' a magistrate with decent grace “May fix the mulct in each familiar case, “(The case, suppose of riot assault,) “Yet justices, like hounds, are oft at fault.” 'Twas thus the days of good Sir Humphrey pass'd Serene; or ruffled by a transient blast; When, gathering on his brow, the cloud of care Betray'd his anxious wishes for an heir. At length his lovely wife began to deem The idea of a son no empty dream. And now the Knight alternate fears and hopes Indulg'd in silence or express'd in tropes; Assum'd amidst his friends a strict reserve; Shrunk from a smile with irritable nerve; And smother'd up his jokes of every sort, In dread of lips too ready to retort. Old Rachel, too, from other cares detacht, Each symptom with a sharper visage watch'd; Mark'd every longing with mysterious look, And puzzled with chimeric cates the cook. And, lo! pale expectation hover'd nigh; And the house witness'd one convulsive sigh. Say who, remote from marriage-scenes, could guess At such an hour the husband's wild distress; Shivering at every pin that chanc'd to drop, For quick relief beseeching Doctor Slop? Ah! who could tell, how strong the emotion rose In the Knight's bosom, at his Harriet's throes? Or, who could paint Sir Humphrey bliss-begone, When Rachel, with a scream, announc'd—a SON! Joy ran electric thro' the dancing dome; And all was transport—but the monkey-room! Sunk on her pillow as his Harriet lay, Her eye-lash veiling each effulgent ray, Her lily-hand so tremulously-weak, A lovely blush fast-mounting to her cheek— Scarce had the Knight his fingers snapt for joy, Press'd her pale lip, and kiss'd the bouncing boy, Ere to his astrologic books he slew; The horoscope with nice precision drew; And on the hereditary vellum-page (In cedar cas'd but tawny-ting'd from age) Enter'd, with all his grandsire Roger's care, The moment of the birth, the natal star— Enrich'd with mystic figures quaint and dark, And many a sage, and many a shrewd remark; While to his penetrating eye appears The colour of his Allan's future years! END OF THE SECOND CANTO. CANTO THE THIRD. ARGUMENT. 1. An Omen—the Family alarmed—Rachel's death—Jenny Jerkairs, Sister of Ned Jerkairs, invited by Prue to supply Rachel's Place at Andarton.—2. Allan, a Child—his Genius—his Sensibility—his Pastimes with little Juliet the Daughter of Geoffry Squintal, and with Henry one of his Schoolmates—Allan, at the Grammar-School at Molfra— his Master, Herbert the Curate—Herbert's Character— Allan's Genius further discoverable in his solitary Walks— his fondness for the wild or beautiful Scenery of Nature—his attachment to the old Armoury and Picture-Gallery—Sir Humphrey describing the Portraits to Allan, particularly those of Cadwallo, who had possessed a Fortiefs in the North of Cornwall; of Hoel his elder Son, who built an Abbey in the East of Cornwall; and of Andar his Younger, who founded the House of Andarton on the Banks of the Fal—Allan's Spirit of Enterprize conspicuous in the Sports of the Field—A Fox Chace described —A Stranger attended by a Train of Servants insulting Allan in the Field—Allan's manly Deportment—The Stranger discovered to be a Nabob, who had bought an Estate contiguous to Andarton.—A Twelfth-Day Feast, the Company—Herbert the Curate, Ned the Attorney, the Squire of Trevalso, Geoffry Squintal, and Alice, his Lady, a Baron's Daughter, late of Landor Abbey; Juliet, the Daughter of Geoffry, and Alice—Allan, at the Age of Fifteen—his Birth-Day celebrated —A Running-Match of Girls; of those Girls Emma the most beautiful—Emma, a Stranger from the Banks of the Tamar—Emma gaining the Prize—Juliet much attached to Emma, who resides in a Cottage near Trevalso—Allan joining Juliet and Emma in their Walks—Juliet fainting at a Shipwreck—Allan surprizing a Sailor and his Dog near Emma's Cottage—3. Sir Humphrey betraying Symptoms of Infirmity—Cautioning Allan against the Nabob Sir Henry Hawtrap, and Geoffry Squintal, and Juliet, and directing his attention to Laura (Alice Squintal's Niece), the Heiress of Landor Abbey—The old Roan Horse dying at Sir Humphrey's Feet—The Knight's decease—His Funeral. From its pure star effusing soft repose The purple morn o'er blest Andarton rose; And, as the smile of peace its radiance told, Each evening linger'd on a cloud of gold. The gentle Fayes with pride perform'd the task Which smooth-shorn parks and waving woodwalks ask; But printed, as they plum'd their guardian wings, Where Harriet bore her babe, their favourite rings. Yet, ah! the gloom-bred sprites that interpose, O'er ancient houses scattering bitter woes, Plann'd the dire scheme to chase each promis'd joy, And mark'd with scowling eyes the unconscious boy. Not long the Knight had pac'd the lawny green With brisker step and more heroic mien; Viewing his groves array'd in brighter bloom To flourish for a thousand years to come; Ere, sudden, his whole house conspir'd to wear A fearful aspect, or dejected air; While all, with one accord, as if undone, Look'd, lank in visage, to his infant son. Indeed, old Avice, with a grandame's pride, The babe had dandled on her knee, and died. Her comrades too, coeval train, were gone, Save the poor butler, whose “beard wagg'd” alone: He, o'er his staff, tho' now condemn'd to droop, Still told his stories to the kitchen groupe; And still, exciting laughter ere he spoke, With sly-set face announc'd the coming joke: But late, the panic of his soul was such, With palsied gait he totter'd o'er his crutch. And now, low whisperings and half-smother'd sighs, And secret parleys and uplifted eyes, And winks, and other strange mysterious ways, The Knight began to notice with amaze; Saw Rachel from her menials take her cue, And caught the insulting titter oft from Prue. In vain he question'd every soul to know The cause of such a gathering gloom of woe; Till butler Frank at length unseal'd his lips, And told the occasion of the sad eclipse; And, as he forc'd a laugh to hide a tear,— “Why, master, it is all a foolish fear; “But sure, betwattled is our house with grief! “Poor Peter quiver'd like an aspin-leaf; “Jane, as she heard it, had hysteric fits; “And Susan ever since hath lost her wits. “Sure, 'tis a sign”—“But what?” (Sir Humphrey cried)— “It never came, they say, but some one died. “Before your father's death I heard strange moans— “Among the pigeon-holes! What piteous tones! “'Twas the same wood-dove—each old servant said— “That hover'd at your grandsire's dying bed. “Alas! 'tis come again! I know its note— “At dusk of eve it roosts on yonder cote; “And all the tamer pigeons in affright “Fly off, or wakeful flutter thro' the night. “The brook, indeed, yet bubbles, with a rill “Clear as the water comes from madam's still. “But signs, good master, are, perhaps, a joke— “The vain surmises of us vulgar folk.” “No—no—” Sir Humphrey cried—“my honest friend— “'Tis well if my decease the dove portend,”— Then to the nursery hied, where Rachel sat Envelop'd in a dismal cloud of fate; Within his cradle rock'd the Suckling saw His breath with suffocative labor draw; And, pondering on pulsations quick and weak, Beheld, with Rachel's eye, the fever'd cheek. But soon, sweet Harriet, smiling thro' her tears, Chas'd from her anxious lord a crowd of fears; And shew'd the bursting tooth as ivory white, That vex'd poor Allan thro' the livelong night. And, as her tumid bosom she disclos'd, Where, draining the pure fount, he oft repos'd, Tho' now his little searching hand no more The mother's breast essay'd to wander o'er, Feeble and pale; tho' now his languid lip Scarce open'd, the balsamic spring to sip; Nor glisten'd to her smile the half-shut eye, Nor lull'd in slumber was the wailing cry; Yet did her soft persuasive voice avail To check the credit of each idle tale, And turn to pleasantry the thoughts that stirr'd The unquiet mind, where groan'd the boding bird; While the fond Knight, enamour'd of her charms, Clasp'd his best soothsayer in his ardent arms. But say, no bird predicts the final doom; Death, to the wise or weak, alas! must come; And she who, with anxiety so deep, Now watch'd the starting infant's troubled sleep, Now, trembling, of her superstitious care To her fond brother lent so large a share, Seem'd, by the emaciate cheek, herself, to prove The importance of the too prophetic dove. To friendly counsel deaf, from doctor's shops She turn'd averse, and said all drugs were slops; Nor heeded her own gallipot or jar, Tho' a sharp cough announc'd the cold catarrh. But as the tepid Spring drove Eurus off, She felt some respite to her bitter cough; And from her lattice-light, as whilom, sly Cast o'er the kitchen a sagacious eye; While by the jingling of her tuneful keys, Whose music for a moment chas'd disease, The little Allan to her room she drew; Tho' tempted by a sweeter lure he flew, And oft, attracted to some jars of delft, Wander'd with cunning eye from shelf to shelf. And now the terrors of the dove were pass'd, And Rachel scarce perceiv'd the wint'ry blast; With sudden influence when December frore Chill'd her weak frame, and stopp'd up every pore. Yet vainly were narcotics deem'd of use, Or diuretic balms, to reproduce The due secretion of the obstructed lymph— All—all were slighted by the pining nymph! Take, Rachel, the diluting medicine take, And clear thy secret ducts for pity's sake. Who, who, when thou art gone, will tell the tale Of good Prince Charles, or brew the October ale? Alas! with thee, thy loyal tales are lost; Nor breathes one jacobite to soothe thy ghost! Scarce in the quiet vault were Rachel's bones Deposited, amidst some decent groans, Ere Prue to Jenny Jerk dispatch'd a card Replete with sentiments of kind regard, And sighing for her presence, to disperse The shades that still were cast from Rachel's hearse. But, tho' she dealt in point and repartee, Jerkairs was not a friend to cordial glee: Hers was the wit that triumphs to defame By scurrilous abuse an honour'd name; The satire, bursting from a rancorous heart, To Prue malignant pleasure to impart; Not frolic humour, to afford relief In each light sally to Sir Humphrey's grief. Yet all too flexible to Prue's request, Sir Humphrey bade her “come, a welcome guest;” Nor, as her virgin steps drew near, demurr'd, Tho' round her whisker'd friends, or mew'd, or purr'd. Thus sorrow renders many a bosom weak, Unmans the soul, and prompts the childish freak; And smiles, till Reason interpose, too late, Alike on those we love and those we hate. Ere long Miss Jerkairs, skill'd to play the part Which owes success to adulation's art, Usurp'd the full dominion of the dome, As if Andarton were her proper home; And offer'd, at her ease, to brother Ned The old blue pallet, or the new chintz bed. And, as her eye in groves no charm perceiv'd, Nor for the fragrant field her bosom heav'd, The pleasures of quadrille the maid embrac'd, Resigning Nature's works to vulgar taste: And, careless how the summer-sunbeam set, While Prue still smil'd, and Ned engag'd Annette; She dealt her cards around, and dealt her wit, And laugh'd, exulting, at each lucky hit. Meantime, the fondest wishes form'd to meet, Play'd lively Allan at his parents feet. His cheek, with more than rosy freshness fair, Glow'd in the shade of brown luxuriant hair: And as, no vulgar spirit to avow, The rude locks started from his open brow; His keen dark eye, that seem'd to scorn control, Bespoke a genuine grandeur of the soul! And whether first, amid his cradle laid, The signs of opening genius he display'd, Or, drawing science from the lacteal duct, Discover'd wond'rous knowlege as he suck'd, And, ere the tongue articulation lends, Had all his letters at his fingers ends; Certain it is, that ere six years were fled, His lesson with emphatic tones he read. Nor was he less distinguish'd, in the string Of boys, that shot the marble thro' the ring! Just Heaven! What looks of hatred and surprize Miss Prudence scatter'd from her blinking eyes; If harsh to feeble nerves his frolic glee, Rous'd her amidst the languor of ennui! And Jerkairs, whilst to please the doating Knight The favourite she caress'd with mock delight, Impatient of her charge, would strangely winch, And vent vexation in a secret pinch. Once, when a ray from Fancy seem'd to chase The spleen-engender'd horrors of her face, Prue whisk'd young Allan into Rachel's room, Where Jerkairs and herself, to break the gloom Of many a murky death-watch, would resort; If sportive, bent on some fantastic sport. 'Twas then, turn'd loose, the kittens, one and all, Here dragg'd a towser, and there seiz'd a cawl. The monkies, rattling round, made cruel work, Here broke a gallipot, there gnaw'd a cork, And, as the pair in plausive triumph laugh'd, There grinn'd and jabber'd o'er a cordial draught: Yet by the kittens tricks nor Allan charm'd, And by the scampering monkies unalarm'd, Stood with the mien that manly spirit wears, Exclaim'd, “Poor Aunt!” and wip'd the starting tears. So beam'd in Allan, gentlest of his kind, The earliest epoch of the unfolding mind. Then too, 'twas sweet to note the blooming boy While every moment danc'd alive to joy, Eager in many a pastime to engage The pretty Juliet of an equal age; Whose sire, a neighbour of no vulgar race, Alas! but ill sustain'd his ancient place. Oft would the gallant hero, to adorn His pleas'd companion, rob the berried thorn, On silk his haws assiduous string, to deck With the red glistening necklace Juliet's neck, And violet braids, or bluebell wreaths prepare For the soft chesnut of her crisped hair. For her, he pluck'd the hazel clusters, brown As his own locks, or rustling shower'd them down; Or gather'd wildwood strawberries, where they stray'd, Sweet frolic imps! beneath the whispering shade. But with a sparkling fountain fond to sport, They hail'd its mossy cave, their prime resort, Its rock-scoop'd bason bubbling tried to reach, Or trac'd its riplings round a hoary beech. There (tho' with many a superstitious look The menials wont to eye the changeful brook) They little heeded its prophetic power, But laugh'd, unconscious of a future hour. There oft, an urchin of the green, with glee Would Henry greet the favourite cave and tree: And, as the schoolmates practis'd harmless wiles, To win, already rivals, Juliet's smiles; A jealous fear, tho' transient, would arrest The joy that flutter'd in each little breast. Time fleets o'er innocence. To Molfra's walls Hark, the school-bell the fatchel'd tyro calls, Erelong, to moralize with Phedrus terse, Or cull rich morsels from Ovidian verse. There, as, at first, he heard with mute surprize From every desk the mingled murmurs rise, With equal wonder he survey'd a show— All, all, like pendulums, wag to and fro; While these a tedious task appear'd to ply Fastening on each hard word the sober eye, And those, whom brisker fancy might engage, Flung but two glances to devour a page; And others seem'd to hunt, with anxious look, A shadowy something thro' a bulky book; As backwards now, and forwards now they turn'd The tumbled leaves, and with vain ardour burn'd. Yet here, a dunce, by heavy mists opprest, Quits his dull work, to interrupt the rest: And there with darts a wicked wit, bumproof, Hits sage Minerva figur'd in the roof, Or pins infixes in tenacious pitch, To pierce, by smart surprize, a brother's breech. Thus, as one general buzz salutes the ear, Thro' lucent glass the glowing bees appear: All seem to kindle with incessant toil From cell to cell, and rear the waxen pile: Here too, slow drones the vivid labors mar, And there, a wicked wasp provokes the war. Sudden, the master's mien spreads pale dismay; And all the busy fervour dies away. How many an imp, that dreads his keen research, Tho' ferulas repose, and sleep the birch, Yet, as no sense of worth vouchsafes a balm, Shrinks, from the imagin'd stroke, his burning palm, Or from the tingling twigs appears to start, And feels his little bum in fancy smart. Not thus the hero-boy the panic fills, His bosom pierces, or his buttock thrills: Yet some mysterious feeling overawes His heart, amidst the universal pause. Conscious, indeed, of merited disgrace As others read their fate in Herbert's face, And droop'd thro' sheepishness, or strove to wear (In vain assum'd) a hypocritic air; He, with a soul that laugh'd at fear or guile, Look'd round to meet the curate's wonted smile. And generous Herbert lov'd young dawning Truth, Still nursing, in himself, the fire of youth. To the sweet buds of mental promise kind, His was to note the first faint traits of mind; Distinguishing the sullen child, the sad, From the free spirit of the alerter lad; Fir'd by the Muse himself, to feed with praise Bosoms where Genius stream'd its living rays, And, far above mechanic plodders, class Such souls selected from the vulgar mass. For such he cull'd the bold, the brilliant thought, The graceful line so exquisitely wrought; To such depictur'd, with the enthusiast's air, Models of ancient worth supremely fair, The trophied chief, the statesman and the sage, The great, the good in Grecia's golden age; And drew, in contrast, as the portraits glow'd, The modern fashionist, the Man of Mode. Yet, midst the tinsel show, one worthy wight He hail'd, and fondly doated on the Knight; His plain simplicity with pleasure trac'd, And with an ardent grasp his views embrac'd. Tho' but a novice with his gun, he strove For the good Knight to clear the tangled grove, And oft on holidays, assur'd to win High favour, volunteer'd a whipper-in. But, from the flashing tube while thunder flew, He thought what game the Grecian arrow slew, And with the Andarton-pack, at dusky dawn, In fancy travers'd the Parthenian lawn. Meantime, the boy to Herbert's curious gaze Discover'd genius brightening to a blaze— An eye, that sparkled at the eccentric thought, Or glisten'd sudden, with a tear-drop fraught; The quick suffusion at his master's glance; A spirit darting like the lightning's lance; The soul within itself retir'd, and round Tho' mingled voices rose, unheeding sound. Attacht to lone retreats, the dingle deep, The longdrawn dale, the mountain's sky-clad steep, If, where the raven shap'd her ancient nest Amid some beech's solitary crest, He scal'd, exulting at her angry croak, Its trunk, and thro' the topmost branches broke; 'Twas not, like half the fatchel-bearing throng, To rob the parent of her callow young; But—“O forgive the intrusion (would he cry) “Whilst, raven! I admire thy glossy dye; “Observe in thy wild haunt, so dark and still, “A dwelling fram'd with more than human skill; “And note, amidst the walks of man so rare, “Unerring prudence in parental care.” Deep in the woodland, high above his head, Their lowest boughs where trees far darkening spread, And bath'd in sky their blue aërial tops; Where not a sheepwalk gleam'd along the copse; Plunging, he oft pursued the screaming pie, Or paus'd, as pierc'd the gloom the falcon's cry; Or where green areas drank the golden light, Mark'd the smooth motion of the gliding kite, And, where a sheltering foliage seem'd to flow, The terror of the birds that shrunk below. What time the tawny forest Autumn heaves, And scatters, at each gust, a shower of leaves; Oft, on some knoll, he caught the rising breeze In its first rustling from the distant trees, Heard the sound lengthen, sigh succeeding sigh, And view'd the billowy gloom with straining eye; Till now, the deepening undulation near, The extensive murmur swell'd upon his ear, And, in one mighty wave, the incumbent wood Rush'd forth, a world of shadow, where he stood. Where, with broad meshes hung, above the glade Two pines, like pillars, form'd a vista'd shade, Pleas'd would he wait that point of twilight pale When flew the woodcock up the silent dale;— Tho', as he musing stood, and lov'd to trace The suntints glowing on the cloud's deep base, And each gradation of the October-view, The burnisht woodmoss, the pale sapling's hue, And, slow-receding into shadow dim The duskier purple on each old oak-limb,— Strait would he leap, as leaps the elastic spring, From his trance waken'd by the woodcock's wing, And tremble, as it beat, escap'd the snare, With desultory plumes the gleaming air. And, as the shade of night began to brood, And now the bright still moonbeam tipp'd the wood; He lov'd to see the grey owl slowly sail From bush to bush, and chase her thro' the vale; Pursue her to her ivied haunt restor'd, Catch her wild hiss, or listen, as she snor'd. If winter, round, his grey-cold mantle threw, As the keen blast from sabler Eurus blew, Absorb'd in pensive thought, he saw the dale One slumbering mass, in torpid horror pale; The glimmering elmrow erst with ivy gay, And the dank flood that urg'd its sullen way; When, by a sudden sunbeam cloath'd in green. Rush'd the long elms, and wav'd a glittering screen; And, its whole channel kindling on the sight, The torrent roll'd its feathery foam in light. Oft too, when snows had veil'd the vale and hill, And all the frozen atmosphere was still; Young Allan to the grove his fancy led, Its ice-clad branches shivering overhead; And bade him listen to the shafted snow That fell, clear-tinkling, on the leaves below, What time the redbreast hopp'd from spray to spray, And ceas'd, too weak, the solitary lay. And, in his wintry rambles, oft he found (Where erst to summer-suns with airy bound The squirrel frisk'd) its nuts a beauteous prize, How brightly burnisht to his Juliet's eyes; Or from some lowly shrub in triumph bore, Seiz'd in its bed of moss, the drowsy dor. Yet not alone the studious Allan woo'd Coy Nature in her calm or pensive mood; But, breaking from her tranquil paths, the form Of danger hail'd amidst the hurtling storm. Tho', as it stain'd the clift's basaltic height, He lov'd the cold blue tint of early light, And oft observ'd the fleeting sunbeam shift To level uplands from that pillar'd clift; Or thence, the sun descending, view'd at eve Its last low circles on the silky wave; Or, thro' dim fissures, wound his dubious way Where never fell one faint reflected ray; Pluck'd the chill dropstone, caught the mineral gleam, Cull'd the grey moss, or trac'd the encavern'd stream. But, oftener, wild with transport, would he climb Some samphir'd ledge, some sea-washt crag sublime; Then rest, exhausted, on the pointed rock, And, at its base where broad the surges broke, Survey the hern that shrieking plung'd beneath, And strait emerg'd amidst a watery wreath; While seagulls high their snowy pinions pour'd And the dark cloud grew sabler as they soar'd, Or, wheeling round on rapid pinion, spread Air-pois'd, their deep pavilion o'er his head. And if in flame, amidst his monster-march, The growling thunder wrapp'd the ethereal arch; Oft would his dauntless spirit mount in air, Brave the red wrath, and triumph in the glare. One evening-close, in heaps by Auster driv'n, As the clouds blacken'd o'er the vault of Heaven, The Knight had miss'd his solitary child, And, by the impatience of his terrors wild, Had search'd, and round dispers'd his menial train, Each cranny of the dome, but search'd in vain; And now, almost a maniac, in the van Along the lawn, beneath the gateway ran; When, sudden, thro' the dense nocturnal shade, Loud from above, a laugh the boy betray'd; And, as the shaking turret sent a groan, Full in a flash from heaven the hero shone! Of flights, indeed, so lavish was the lad, That the poor menials set him down for mad; Ascribing, strait, with visages drawn lank, To lunar influence each adventurous prank. Vers'd in the pageantries of old romance, The heroic boy would ponder o'er Provence, Or Albion colour'd by chivalric hues, Nor quit the Cambrian bards for Maro's Muse. Amidst these fancies, in the rust of arms Each hour, the enthusiast saw some recent charms; With looks that kind assistance seem'd to ask The cuirass ey'd far off, the cobweb'd casque; And their dark brassy red, their steely blue Admir'd, still longing for a nearer view. The dinner-bell had chim'd the hour of one, No Allan near: the roving boy was gone. And now, tho' none had mark'd his devious track, All read his madness in Moore's Almanack! “We might have found the fit, exact at noon! “So stupid—not to notice the full moon!” And, lo!—Miss Prue, perhaps, enjoy'd the joke— Each untouch'd viand pour'd a feeble smoke; When, after various search, the trembling Knight Discover'd, on the ruin'd castle-scite, And in amazement view'd the eccentric boy, Grasping, as others would have grasp'd a toy, What, falling from its wainscot, might o'erwhelm E'en Allan's vigour, an enormous helm: The ponderous helmet yet the boy convey'd From its dim pannel to the castle-shade. But most young Allan, from a trowser'd child, Admir'd his “whisker'd sires and mothers mild;” And to the gallery, ere his sire he saw, Would, every holiday, in haste withdraw; When once Sir Humphrey read, with fond surprize, An amateur in Allan's sparkling eyes. “Yes, yes! my boy—such Chiefs attention claim, “Far different from the sons of modern fame. “How many an anecdote of those grave folks “My sire would season with abundant jokes. “First, view yon picture of the Castle, flank'd “By that firm buttress, with a moat embank'd; “While, far beneath, along the peopled glade, “The straw-cots darken in its stately shade. “The portraits here, whose colours cease to glow, “Whose burnisht frames now fade along the row, “Were, as the records of Andarton tell, “From the rent castle rescued ere it fell. “There, on the left, less tawny forms appear; “Their features round and full; their drapery clear: “Those bolder outlines speak more recent hands, “Posterior to the rebel Cromwell's bands. “But to these ancient figures first we bow. “Here, what a Chief! How stern his warrior-brow! “Know, midst the Cambrian glens, my son, we trace “To a proud earl our high-descended race. “From Cambria when the chieftain issued forth, “He seiz'd a Cornish fortress of the North. “There long he liv'd, with power, with plenty blest, “And half Cornubia's sylvan lands possess'd. “There, dying midst his thick assailing foes, “His sons he summon'd—so tradition goes— “And strait display'd, while ebb'd his vital blood, “Two topaz rings with wondrous power endued; “And”—‘Hoel, take this ring portentous, take— ‘And Andar this, for brave Cadwallo's sake. ‘With pious care these peaceful tokens keep, ‘Nor bid them in a dark oblivion sleep. ‘So shall ye live, in faith, in friendship staunch; ‘So bloom for ages, each fraternal branch. ‘But if, from distance, at some future day, ‘The memory of your kindred names decay; ‘These meeting rings, by strange attractive power, ‘The pristine union shall, my son! restore. ‘I die—but here, beside this shatter'd wall, ‘Inter me, with my sabre, ere it fall.’ “While cruel discord bade the brothers part, “High Hoel, vaunting a religious heart, “Fast by some eastern stream an abbey rear'd; “And Andar midst his Cornish troops appear'd “The valorous chief, and nigh the Fala's wave “Its infant name to old Andarton gave. “See, then, the sable Andar, dim-portray'd, “And note that ring fast-sinking into shade. “Together with the ill-omen'd gift, the Thane, “'Tis said, was buried in some neighbour-fane. “See next the son of Andar more grotesque; “Tho' fading from its outline, picturesque. “Curls from his upper lip, tho' smooth his chin, “A look, that not to nurse, he deem'd a sin. “Yes! e'en at court the fierce Sir Hugh appear'd, “While scoff'd the Normans at his upper beard. “His belt once gemm'd with many a precious stone, “Now mourns its rubies lost, its garnets gone: “His woolsack breeches would my sire amuse; “Nor less the structure of his wooden shoes. “A limner of a later age, 'tis said, “Drew these quaint figures from some dreaming head. “And see yon vest, that trains in many a fold, “Once richly pictur'd for a cloth of gold. “Degory! thy reputation here may rest— “Thy virtue slumbers in a golden vest. “Lo, in a robe of velvet richly clad, “Old Blanch his sister, who expir'd a maid— “Her wrists and collar deeply trimm'd with fur; “Her virgin fame unspotted with a slur. “'Twas in the reign of the fifth Harry, staunch “In vestal honours, flourish'd sister Blanch. “Our family, my son, hath cause to bless “Yon chief who wears the collar of S. S. “'Twas he, connected with a Count, renew'd “The impoverish'd current of the Andarton-blood. “But, lo! yon warrior clad in coat of mail— “His beaver up—I shudder at the tale. “Shaking his tilting-staff, he eyes askance “The fragments of the foeman's broken lance. “But bloody vengeance quick pursued the blow— “He met a dire assassin in the foe. “The piece, that now attracts thy curious eyes, “Exhibits female beauty in disguise. “Our modern dames would scarce essay to lift “The golden weight of such a cumbrous shift, “That with a gorgeous store of trimmings drest “Bids its deep lace envelope all the breast. “And, lo! with buttons stuck, with broidery rough, “Gloves for a dozen females large enough; “And other fripperies that have e'er disgrac'd “The sex, to fashion bending, not to taste. “Yet mark, my son, the venerable pair— “That ermin'd robe, that cap's judicial air “Which to the full round face gives sapience high, “And deep decision to the stedfast eye. “He, who from good Queen Bess extorted praise, “How would he frown on these degenerate days! “And dost thou note his consort's sweeping train, “Her high-wrought buttons and her massy chain? “That chain of every heir hath grac'd the birth— “The original I mean—of mickle worth— “And, if an old tradition credit claim, “(An old tradition of prophetic fame) “As long as, glittering from the jack, we boast “That relic of renown, to rule the roast, “So long (and sure it merits well thy care) “Andarton-house shall never want an heir. “But see, so black its locks, that visage bluff, “With whiskers staring wild, and stiffen'd ruff; “Each eye those masses of strong shadow strike, “Where artists hail the pencil of Vandyke. “Behold a ruff, more elevated, deck “His stately lady, Dionysia's neck. “From her left hand a bracelet's diamond light “Decays—a fan, dim-figur'd, in her right; “Thro' her, the daughter of the judge, we rais'd “Our tottering house, and with new splendour blaz'd. “Their son, the last in all this reverend row, “Sigh'd o'er his castle-walls, alas! laid low; “Saw from his gateway rebel swords distain “These sacred shades, and mourn'd the mangled slain.” Now to the gallery had calm eve withdrawn Its last faint suntint from the velvet lawn, Yet heightening with a gleam of radiance weak The dusky redness of Sir Roger's cheek. “Come, leave, (he cries) as eve's pale shadows close “Around, these grave old gentry to repose. “And, lo! that reverend row, where Damaris joins “The sleek Sir Roger, from whose lusty loins “Thy grandsire sprung, shall meet thy curious eyes, “Soon as to-morrow's morn shall gild the skies. “But see Sir Roger, e'en on canvass big, “Can coax a sunbeam to his fullbrown wig— “Still seems alert, with face so rubicund, “To drink and pun, as once he drank and punn'd: “Ah! (cried Sir Humphrey) 'twas Sir Roger built “That golden chamber, once so richly gilt. “There (would he tell), when music wak'd the dance, “Was many a stripling fir'd by Beauty's glance: “There, with young hearts, as rogueish Cupid plagu'd, “Were half the matches of the county made.” Now the soft down, as lambent o'er his chin, His vivid cheek, its shade had sprinkled thin; When still the boy was tranc'd by bardic dreams Midst mountain-glooms, or dell-secluded streams: Tho, often, would he join the social train Borne by his active spirit o'er the plain; Not where weak puss the circling hunters trace, But wild where forest-inmates fire the chace. “Yet” (cried the youth, on other times intent, When by stout arms the tough yew-bow was bent), “O could I follow the keen falcon's flight, “And view him pounce his prey like arrowy light; “The guerdon of the trophied hunter win, “Where towering antlers brush the woods of Glynn; “Or brave the British tiger's fiery rage, “Or with the tusked boar fierce battle wage— “E'en now I hear the thrilling bell-horn's blast! “I see proud steeds, the gulphy stream o'erpast, “Foam in full gallop down the rushing wood— “I see the dewlapp'd beagle gor'd with blood! “Alas! where now the field of British praise? “Adieu the deeds of old chivalric days!” 'Twas at the feast, when many a rustic squire In mild town-spirits rais'd the intense desire To bid the henroost felon meet his doom, That expectation heighten'd Allan's bloom. Red o'er its eastern slope while peep'd the dawn, The moon's faint silver touch'd the shadowy lawn: The stars had faded in the blush of day, Yet twinkled, with quick radiance, West away; When huntsman Peter blew the awakening horn, And bade the unkennel'd hounds salute the morn. The neighing steeds, with ardour all aloof, To echo wildly struck the rattling hoof; As Neville, first, beheld with eager ken Far off, the misty glimmering of the glen, Where Reynard, his nocturnal rapine clos'd, Sated, amid slain geese, perhaps, repos'd; As Ned the attorney, trembling for his neck, A restive sorrel vainly strove to check; And Allan won, thro' grassy lanes, his way, With mounting spirits, on the dappled grey; Now held the whipper-in in deep discourse, By turns admir'd the master and the horse; Express'd some wonder that in flesh so spare The creature could so bold a rider bear, Yet archly said, that spindles of such length, Such ribs, had double swiftness, double strength; And learn'd how Rosinante, from a colt, Had scrap'd acquaintance with each fox's holt. Not with the sacred love of hunting smit, But curious to behold the maniac fit When down the craggs their coursers dash'd amain, The classic curate join'd the hunter-train. Pleas'd, with Sir Humphrey, from some height to court A fleeting prospect of the motley sport, Perhaps he heeded not the vanisht hound, But calmly gallop'd o'er Ovidian ground; Invok'd fair Dian, or to prove his skill, Rehears'd sonorous lines from Somerville! Scarce had the terriers, 'neath a rocky steep, Pierc'd the close bushes of the dingle deep, Ere Reynard, sneaking round the scented spot, Swift as an arrow from the thicket shot, Trembled amidst the boisterous taliho, And shook the dewdrops from his tail of snow. Up the long brake he speeds, then gains a copse, And down the shelving slope that instant drops, And rushes thro' a valley's elmy round, And doubling backward, gains his former ground; There, in his dingle, with a transient halt, Enjoys a stilly pause, the hounds at fault. Again he hears, arous'd by every gale, The obstreperous sounds that mingle thro' the dale; When, quick detecting, with a villain's eye, A hare that in her form was shrinking nigh, He, to the murmuring dogs, poor Puss betrays, And sends them opening thro' the various maze; Slinks in the rear, observes her circling track, Marks the fair view, and slow pursues the pack. Ah! soon (whilst cover'd in a swamp of reeds The treachor lies) his feeble victim bleeds. Nor had the dogs regain'd the dying scent, Had not a saucy pie, on mischief bent, Chatter'd and scream'd across their dubious way, Then hover'd o'er the reeds where Reynard lay. Abrupt he hurries from the ill-trusted plash, As wrath and fear his glaring eyeballs flash; He flies—and o'er a thousand vallies borne Mix in one maddening chorus hounds and horn His sanguine spurs the courser's sides distain, The proud boy bending o'er the fiery mane. Now, scattering o'er a park the terriers pour'd, As if the verdure they at once devour'd; When, sudden, where a bordering mead they cross'd, And on the level sod a moment lost The fainting scent; a horseman rude appear'd, And, as his steed superbly pranc'd and rear'd, A liveried train behind their master blaz'd, And rustic admiration round him rais'd. With air imperious thro' the trembling field He rush'd; and, as the hounds wheel'd backwards, wheel'd, And broad at Allan aim'd the insulting stare; While Allan, with a cool and conscious air Of mental grandeur, met his scornful eyes, And o'er his face saw pique and choler rise. And now, while triumph spreads a general flush, Exhausted Reynard drags his scenty brush; His last faint effort, thro' a farmyard breaks, With shivering limbs along the homestall sneaks, And creeps, where erst he kenn'd, intent on blood With fascinating eyes the feathery brood. There, where he oft had seiz'd his gasping prey, Detected by a clown the felon lay. Lo, at his streaming throat the terriers hang, And, as the horn gives echo every clang, And shouts and Allan's shriller voice his death Announce, reluctant yet, he yields his breath;— When, with pale passion on his palsied lip, The stranger, fierce at Allan, smack'd his whip, The hero-boy the smack with smack repaid, And calm, the menace with a smile survey'd. Soon as the story reach'd Sir Humphrey's ear, O'er his lov'd boy he dropp'd for joy a tear. But, when the flaming stranger was describ'd, The Nabob who had erst the borough brib'd, The Nabob who had bought the adjacent lands, Sir Humphrey with new transport clasp'd his hands. Tho' Allan, where a blustering Thraso swell'd, Each insult with a lion heart repell'd, Yet, gentle as the wood's retiring dove, His bosom heav'd to every sigh from love. One Twelve-day, whilst on each still pane was rais'd Frost's palmy leaves, and broad the chimney blaz'd; Stretcht on the groaning board the sirloin smoak'd, Each appetite a capon plump provok'd, And in the centre, tempting every eye, With standing crust, appear'd the Christmas pye. Yet somehow, in Sir Humphrey's mind at least, 'Twas very different from a Twelve-day feast. The lorn sirloin, while now no tongue could tell Its little history, relisht once so well, While none essay'd its annals to record, And trace it e'en from clover to the board, In vain its old credentials wish'd to claim, To shine among sirloins of mighty name. Beneath the shade of poor Sir Humphrey's frown, Its lack of fat and frothiness and brown, Disconsolate, the capon seem'd to mourn— In former times 'twas roasted to a turn! And, in the paleness of its standing crust The pye betray'd a symptom of distrust. In truth, the dishes tho' the curate bless'd— By the blue devils they were all possest; And the keen sport of knives too sad to urge, Breath'd in pathetic union Rachel's dirge. Not, Jenny Jerkairs! thus forlorn thy case, Tho' doom'd to fill departed Rachel's place; While Prue her visage sharpen'd in a sneer, And mix'd with scowling looks thy satyr-leer! Here, the calm curate bade his cares repose: There, Ned the attorney sat with twisted nose. And, lo! from his new sociable let down, (A fine machine that dazzled all the town) Trevalso's 'Squire! Tho' polisht and urbane, He rarely talk'd with rustic wights profane; Since, in the borough-business long immerst, And late in military tactics verst, His mind to nobler objects he withdrew, And shone a townclerk and a colonel too! Erect amid his Cornish cousins set, He puffs, and eyes askance his epaulette! His wife, a Baron's daughter, knew to hide Beneath a courtly smile baronial pride; Rain'd looks of civil sort on all alike, And pleas'd the million, while she fail'd to strike. And Alice had the Squire vouchsaf'd to wed; Tho' midst the pomp of Landor-abbey bred. Her girl, sweet Juliet, thro' maternal care, Had caught, it seems, an artificial air; No longer with amusive fancies wild, Or laugh'd, or prattled as a careless child; Practis'd her pretty syllables to lisp, Despis'd of playfulness each Will-o-wisp; Yet, only half-instructed “to behave,” A transient blush, by fits, to nature gave; From observation shrunk, a little shy, And droop'd at Allan's glance her conscious eye. And from her cradle to her teens, design'd For Allan, in old Geoffry's scheming mind, She fidg'd about, each time her father spoke, In apprehension of a threatened joke. Thus, the kind Fay, that heightens rural glee, Mourn'd with dim eye the vanisht jubilee! But, as the genial bowl with vapours bland, Now bade the bosom-sentiment expand, More warm the love of Christmas converse wax'd, And its tense muscles every face relax'd. Scarce were the guests, indeed, dispos'd to pour The glass, in honour of the festal hour, Ere, from Sir Humphrey's table, Squintal ran To scenes of fetes luxurious, and began To range in rapture o'er the splendid board Of his poor brother, the departed Lord; From lords to dukes, to dignify his prose, In all the grandeur of the climax rose; And, beating round Andarton-dale again, With his new friend the Nabob clos'd the strain: When Alice bow'd at every sage remark, And flew from vulgar halls to Landor-park. Indeed, accustom'd to such lordly pride, To such magnificence (she said and sigh'd) As wealth displays in Landor's stately dome, She barely (she avow'd) had elbow-room; Then told, how with a more than mother's care, She cherish'd, erst, the beauteous Laura there— Her niece, with whom the Graces lov'd to sport, Erelong to add new brilliance to the court. At Laura's name, Sir Humphrey would have thrown A look of mystic meaning on his son, But, ere that look of mystery could be cast, Caught the poor stripling riveted full fast— Absorb'd, perhaps, by visionary charms, Some fancied Juliet clasping in his arms, And, with a frown to check the unfolding joy, Restor'd to reason the romantic boy. The curate, in a reverie far gone, Sang thro' his teeth, or utter'd half a groan; And, beckoning to the laurel walk, tho' spread With sheets of ice, reluctant Allan led. “Ah! ne'er, my boy (he cried), be thine to court “Such neighbours as with veteran customs sport, “Who scorn the good old paths their fathers trod, “And, but to Fashion bead, their only god. “To affectation whilst the Squire resign'd, “His mansion opens to the surly wind, “Plans his new schemes, and Taste and Reason shocks “With taudry rails around “the Summer-box;” “To fresh-sprung fools the willing ear he lends, “And scorns the virtues of his ancient friends; “Exchanges old plain-dealing for finesse, “And smothers kindness under politesse. “His treacherous art, my boy, be thine to slight, “Tho' to “the Summer-box” his smile invite; “Nor dare the girl's insidious poison sip, “Tho' dimpled Juliet pout her pretty lip.” He said: each syllable, perhaps, was true; But, silent as the leaves, the boy look'd blue; And, wondering how dim alleys, stiff with ice, Could to their bower the pedagogue entice, In tremulous accents a proposal made To quit, for seenes less drear, the shivering shade. The drooping spirits of the hall to raise, The Knight had pleaded for old Christmas plays. Strait at the word the impatient Allan flew, And round the scatter'd chairs in order drew. Mirth beam'd a moment; from Sir Humphrey's mien Its radiance scattering the cold damp of spleen. Tho' wrapt in all the still reserve of Whist, Squintal his pompous gravity dismiss'd; Prue banish'd from her visage every cloud; And Jenny Jerkairs scream'd, and laugh'd aloud. But Allan, into blunders oft betray'd By fits of absence, many a forfeit paid; And doom'd, as now at length the lots were drawn, By a strange penance to redeem a pawn, Certes, he judg'd the sentence passing hard To ape the mercer with his flippant yard, And measure ells on ells behind the screen— But ells of love with Juliet, all unseen. Its ribbon slipp'd aside, without a check A truant lock had wander'd down her neck; While o'er her cheek its sister gently stray'd, And veil'd her blushes in its chesnut shade. And, as thy lip effus'd a brighter glow, And moist, its liquid ruby seem'd to flow, Could Allan dare, delicious Juliet, sip The insidious poison from that pretty lip? Such was the moment, when o'er Fancy's fire Pass'd a fleet shade from fear and fond desire: Full soon, my Allan! on thy careless hour A deeper gloom shall grinning demons pour. To mark his Allan's birth, the genial sprite Each year had duly bless'd the festal rite. Behold, that spirit welcom'd in fifteen An eye fire-darting, a commanding mien; The rich carnation of the vivid cheek Thro' whose clear brown a sunbeam seem'd to break, Happy, that such a stripling bloom'd to grace The hoary woodlands of the Andarton-race; When now, to usher in the natal morn, (A mild October saw the hero born) Sir Humphrey, with a parent's cordial smile, Drew up his pleas'd domestics, rank and file; And plac'd his heir exulting at their head, And to the down the due procession sped; There mark'd his tin bounds with exact regard, As delving spades renew'd the mouldering sward; Thence, while pale Eurus o'er the dusky surf Roll'd his rent foliage like the billowy surf, Thence led them from the young plantation grove That skirts the bottom, to the slope above, And bade, along the hill, the scattering train Here set a sycamore, there plant a plane; Here beds of ashkeys and of acorns sow, There range the little elms in many a row. “Yes! (cried Sir Humphrey, with a flush of joy,) “To grace the birth-day of my generous boy, “I sow my acorns that, in future time, “May rise old England's wooden walls sublime.” Yet oft he shudder'd at the woodman's stroke; Tho' many a mighty patriarchal oak Across the glens the extensive shadow flung, Or down his shelving hills romantic hung. Beneath his avenue's majestic shades The Knight next hail'd the village-boys and maids, As lambkins gamesome, the broad trunks between, Or peeping shy as fawns from alleys green. Strait at his beck as all drew near the Knight, He bade, his bosom bounding at the sight, The buxom troop their wonted sports renew, Or hunt the slipper, or the ball pursue, At “blindman's-buff” along the verdure play, Or thread the needle, rang'd in quaint array; Till now, to crown the whole with festal grace, Sir Humphrey to the girls propos'd a race; And, for the damsel who outran the rest, Nam'd the fair prize, and ey'd each eager breast— A prize that Allan's self would soon bestow, Enough to set their bosoms in a glow— A chaplet sweet (he cried) no maid would miss; And mark, ye dainty girls, a sweeter kiss! The garland, tho' it told October sear, In each dim floret of the waning year, Yet beaming thro' the cornflower's modest blue, And the pale pansy of a fainter hue, The marigold's intenser flame display'd— “So (cried the Knight) shall burn the victor maid.” Gay from the porch, to meet the rustic troop, Advanc'd the ladies in a motley groupe. There Madam Squintal ponder'd o'er the show; And tripp'd her daughter on fantastic toe, In fond idea join'd the rival throng, And with the zephyr's lightness skimm'd along; And, lo! her eyeballs stern on Juliet nail'd, Prue stood, as in her mother-earth dovetail'd. Now, all on tiptoe, singled out by lot, Appear'd four lasses on the appointed spot— One, for the match, perhaps, too tightly lac'd, As taper'd, like the inverted cone, her waist, Who struggling to be crown'd, it seems, the first, Had, ere she started, all her braces burst— More politic and wise, another maid In azure bedgown airily array'd, Its flowings by a sash of pink represt, Her bashful cheek low bent upon her breast— Her cheek, by which the bard might deem outdone The melting peach, its side against the sun— Another, neat at every pretty point, And supple at each lubricated joint, With features larger from a cap round-ear'd, And shining elbows that so plump appear'd, With lovely feet so famous at the fair, That drew, where'er she stepp'd, the rustic stare; And ankles that, so delicate and smooth, Won vast applause from every buzzing booth— The last, attracting to her easy mien, Her native elegance, each eye, I ween, Adorning, by her simple grace, a gown, Tho' nicely needled, plain and russet-brown, With kerchief snowy-white, without a flaw, And light upon her head a hat of straw Tied with a purple ribbon, whose bright hue O'er her young bloom a kindling lustre threw, Where gleam'd some sunny freckles, sprinkled thin, To give new richness to her lucid skin. Thus o'er the thorn, amidst the vernal beam, Thin-sprent at first, its earlier blossoms gleam. And quaintly lurk'd on that sweet face, a mole Whence her blue eyes an arch effulgence stole; Whilst, heaving as sweet Emma's bosom heav'd, A ringlet's golden glow her kerchief's white reliev'd. “Heigh, Emma (cried the Knight in waggish strain), “What you, you saucy baggage, here again! “Oft, to your proper parish, have I said, “I'd send you packing, you young alien jade: “But, mind you, beat your rivals in the row; “Or off to Tamar-banks full speed you go.” The ladies titter'd at the harmless joke— But Madam Squintall trembled as he spoke. Now from Sir Humphrey's o'er the level ground To Allan's oak (whose stem was fenc'd around By rails to every poet's eye, I ween, Invisible, as spread with olive green) The space was measur'd for each dainty lass, In fancy passing quick as shadows pass. Strait, at the signal, started “Bedgown-blue,” And, as on airy pinion, Emma flew; And “Boddice-burst” appear'd to mock the wind In speed, and “Shining elbows” puff'd behind. Hot was the race. Now, “Boddice-burst,” beside, With strong exertion e'en with Emma vied: Now “Bedgown-blue” had Emma far outstripp'd, And now “Blue-bedgown,” on a sudden, slipp'd, And half-recovering, slided off, as shod With ice, and tumbled on the shaven sod— When Emma pass'd; and distancing the rest, Sprang to the goal, the victor-girl confest. The flowery garland Allan wav'd in air; With eager transport seiz'd the panting fair; Deep as she blush'd, her hat of straw unbound, And with the wreath her starting tresses crown'd; And, hastening to confer a brighter palm, Breath'd o'er her lips, and stole ambrosial balm. The exulting Allan, as he look'd askance, From Juliet met a cold repulsive glance; Whilst Prue, who, half consum'd by passion pale, Had view'd the buxom triumph thro' her veil, Soon as on Juliet's eye a gathering cloud She saw, with joy convulsive laugh'd aloud. Yet, whether with its cloud caprice's blast, Or jealousy had Juliet's eye o'ercast, Yet Emma who, beneath a neighbouring shed, By her neat needle earn'd her daily bread, Assur'd to meet her Juliet's gentle smile, Cross'd the fern-lane, and climb'd the shadowy stile, Oft at Trevalso bade the morning hour Sun with bright ray the favourite filbert bower, Or met the nunnery's ivy to the beam Of noonday, sparkling o'er the dimply stream, Or with her friend, amidst familiar talk, Imbib'd the freshness of a twilight walk. Then Allan, with a boy's impatience rude, Would on the rustling bower, perhaps, intrude, Or sudden, in some glimmering woodpath, greet The vagrant couple; tho' as kidlings fleet They glanc'd, elusive, down the purple glade, Or plung'd into the gloom of deeper shade. But oft, 'twas his their wanderings to arrest, And seize the woodnymphs to his service prest; Clear their wild pathway thro' entangling dells, Or lead them upwards where the hillside swells; Thro' plashy roads o'erhung by many a spray, Or thro' long meadows point their frolic way; Conduct the virgins o'er the expanding downs, To where the seabeat promontory frowns; And guide their fancies to the yellow ship, Or the faint sail that speck'd the distant deep. The museful maids there stood, or wander'd slow, Till darkness brooded on the dells below; Heard the last murmur of the dying breeze As twilight linger'd on the placid seas; Or view'd with terror, to the rocky verge Fast rivetted, the foam of every surge. One evening to their custom'd rock, tho' red The thunder lower'd, the fair-ones Allan led; When to the margin, at a seaman's shriek, Pale Juliet ran, and saw the billows break O'er a rent ship, and shiver'd all aghast, As groan'd beneath her feet the struggling mast! And her faint frame their strength could scarce sustain, To reach the cottage in the willowy lane. Once, nigh that cottage, Allan rambling there, To hail, as erst, the sweet, the eccentric pair, Perceiv'd the semblance of a sailor's mien Glide by, and rush the veiling boughs between; Whilst a white dog across the threshold sprung, And o'er his master's track low whining hung. Suffus'd with blushes Emma droop'd her head, And, “she was all alone”—with tremour said. “Aye—aye—I'm sorry” ('twas but half in jest He cried) “to interrupt an hour so blest. “Where then is Juliet?” Muttering an adieu, With sighs unbidden from the cot he flew. Sweet is the springtide promise! But the Muse Must quick revert her eye to cheerless views— From vernal blossoms to the yellow leaf, From young-ey'd Pleasure to lack-lustre Grief. Whilst the good Knight still woo'd at morning break The balmy spirit to his aged cheek; Breath'd o'er that cheek, as erst, the roseate air, But left, alas! too faint its tincture there. Still would he down his winding pathway pass, As the dews glimmer'd on the quivering grass; And, ere the morn had shed a fervid beam, View the mist parting from the pale blue stream: But from the quivering grass, the streamlet blue, A damp to chill his creeping blood he drew. One melancholy morn, with quick surprize The motes of faintness dimm'd his dancing eyes; But, as he totter'd in his wonted track, The South's soft influence brought his senses back; When now his son's, his Harriet's hand he press'd, And, lifting each with ardour to his breast, To Allan cried: “My boy, all flesh is grass! “See but the shade of what thy father was! “But for the solemn hour I calmly wait— “We all must kick the bucket, soon or late: “I too must seek, as all my fathers did, “A long, long sleep beneath my coffin-lid: “Then hear, my child, and heed Sir Humphrey's words, “When low he lies, enclos'd by narrow boards. “Hard is, perhaps, thy duty to sustain “Uninjur'd, thy transmitted old demesne; “Hard in an age, where wanton Pleasure fires “Her sons, with virtue to pursue thy sires. “Behold, from high Sir Andar seated here, “These quiet fields they lov'd, beyond the gear “Of courts or camps; yet, nerv'd by courage, rose “To guard their country from assailing foes. “And long Andarton-grove to laughing day “Might wave its boughs, unweeting of decay, “But for those blasts from many a foreign land— “Those pois'nous plants from India's fiery sand “That scatter all the blooms of English birth, “And wrap in pestilence intrinsic worth. “With rapine's bloody spoils ignobly crown'd, “See Nabobs purchase half the county round; “Reducing many a little farm to one, “Bidding each cot, heigh presto, heigh begone! “And, as the luxury of the merchant spreads “Its bane from halls to farms, from farms to sheds; “The yeoman, overgrown and proud of purse, “Damns each day-labourer with a hearty curse, “Assigns to all their work with priggish air, “Nor aught of labour condescends to share; “But, percht upon his pamper'd steed, looks down “With grin contemptuous on the toiling clown; “To view his far-extending acres, rears “His crest, and in a canter disappears! “Tho' Hawtrap, as with fond impatient eyes “He marks thy wasted manors for a prize, “Erelong may strive, by each insidious art, “To wind into thy young unguarded heart; “Yet never mayst thou heed his specious smile, “But rise superior to a Nabob's wile. “See thy weak neighbour—see Trevalso's lord “Lur'd by the splendour of Sir Hawtrap's board; “Foredoom'd, my son, to mourn, perchance too late, “The exhausted acres of his old estate. “What tho', with sly device, his Indian friend “Each venal hope to yonder borough bend; “Tho' Hawtrap's wit may sharpen Geoffry's ???? “In league against Halvenna's sacred house; “Tho', wading thro' chicanery to a seat, “The townclerk bow submiss amongst the great, “Or reel, by many a borough favour drunk; “Yet shall he rue his race ignobly sunk. “And, ah! my son, let no low lurking flame “Awake in blushes at his daughter's name. “Oft have I seen designing Geoffry ply “The well-aim'd joke, and guide thy boyish eye “To Juliet's beauties; but from no caprice “I point thy nobler prospect to the niece. “Where Landor-woods, in all their hoary pride, “Wave high above the Tamar's pleasant tide, “An heiress lives—Those woods may, haply, claim “Some slight attention to their ancient fame. “'Twas there, the townclerk, in his gilded coach, “To Laura's aunt maneuvr'd his approach; “And tho' his love, 'tis said, hung somewhat loose, “Cajol'd his Alice into Hymen's noose. “Of Hoel, tho' we scarce discern a trace, “Hoel, perhaps, may live in Landor's race: “And Laura may the union-ring possess, “Thine heritage, thro' future times, to bless.” He paus'd; when, sudden, from behind the trees, A clattering noise came wafted on the breeze. And now distinct the sound of hoofs was heard, Tho' neither horseman's form, nor horse appear'd; Till, wheeling round the forest-skirts, was seen The poor old Roany on the level green; Who galloping towards his master sped, And oft with feeble efforts rais'd his head, Expanding his wide nostrils as for air, While each dim eyeball cast a transient glare; Then, as his master he essay'd to greet, Stagger'd, and falling at Sir Humphhey's feet, Neigh'd, with the triumph of a moment fir'd, And faintly neigh'd again, and strait expir'd. “Alas! (Sir Humphrey cried) my generous Roan! “Faithful for thrice ten years! for ever gone! “How often has thy back, from jocund morn “To closing eve, thy grateful master born! “How proud wert thou, with purple housings deckt, “And prancing, too impatient to be checkt, “When, sheriff, to the county-town I rode! “Yes! with thy master's pomp thy spirit glow'd! “And old, my Roany, we together grew, “To the first vows of youthful friendship true. “Yes! thou wert true, tho' struggling in the grasp “Of death—yet faithful to thy latest gasp! “Blest, if from every taint of vice so free, “Full soon, poor Roany, shall I follow thee!” Thus spoke the Knight: and, weeping like the child, Thro' many a tear with conscious pleasure smil'd; As memory, viewing Time's unruffled course, Trac'd back'd his fondness for his aged horse. And the sad presage o'er the beast he lov'd Too true, alas! his failing stomach prov'd. To tempt his appetite, vain every cate; And smok'd the rich sirloin, alas! too late. Oft, fancying a variety of food, Pickles, he thought, might do his stomach good. But, ah! while Indian baubles mock'd his sight, In green, or yellow, or vermilion bright, Ah! then, poor Rachel! then we mourn'd thee most— Thy pickles were, alas! thy proudest boast. E'en tho' his lovely wife, with fearful eyes Would strive to dress a capon Rachel-wise, And froth the juicy breast, so plump and brown, He pick'd, but not a morsel could put down. Idle was every effort to bring out The viscid humours of a floating gout; And, as the stomach felt inflaming pain, The potent balms of Usquebaugh were vain. Behold, as Allan o'er his pillow hung, The fire renew'd his tale with faultering tongue: And, as he seem'd to feel the fainting close Of life, Sir Humphrey on his pillow rose: “Court not, my boy, Ambition's dizzy seat— “Prize the rare blessing of a safe retreat. “But if thy genius urge thee to explore “The domes that dazzled in the days of yore, “O chief to Landor-abbey turn thy heart, “Tho' Juliet may, perhaps, deserve a part.” Arch look'd the Knight—the Knight must still be arch, With every heartpulse beating the dead march— Then said, on Harriet fixing his fond eye, “Beside my fire Sir Richard let me lie”— And calling his domestics, with the tone Of dying goodness, bless'd them; one by one; Then rais'd, in token of the expiring breath His feeble hand, and clos'd his eyes in death. Tho' Death! thy every feature chill the soul, Yet, lo! thy herses more terrific roll! How lengthen'd to the view the Andarton-glooms, When thy pale steeds high shook their sable plumes; And at the waving of the lurid torch, Where, hung above the little woodbin'd porch Thy hatchment seem'd to tremble in the glare, How darken'd round the deep nocturnal air! But, whilst thy herse in long procession drawn, Display'd its dreadful trappings down the lawn, Whilst good Sir Humphrey's venerable coach Made to the churchyard stile its slow approach, How teem'd, as Fancy all her visions brought, With grief and terror every pause of thought. Yet Allan, as the whole impassion'd crowd Or wept in silent woe, or sobb'd aloud, Drew from the funeral sob, the funeral tear, The joy of grief that scatter'd every fear. The vault now left, amidst the charnel air, One solitary mourner linger'd there— One poor domestic breath'd the unnotic'd moan, And, with cold nose, still press'd the dripping stone. Yes! poor old Cato there his head reclin'd, And to his master all his soul resign'd: And had not butler Frank, at break of day, From the chill pavement dragg'd the dog away, There Cato had erelong expir'd, to prove The attachment of a more than human love. “Oft, while my lord was ill (the butler said), “Cato howl'd sore, and sadly droop'd his head! “Then, weeks ago, while shudder'd every limb, “I saw the fount o'erflow its rocky brim; “And, where so late it cast the limpid gleam, “Swell round its mossy beech, a puddled stream. “Yet master's end so near I never thought; “No frightful dove came fluttering to the cote: “But, oh! the moment when the Knight was dead “The tenants knew, for all the rooks were fled: “And not a rook, to mend the nests, I ween, “Amid the dismal elms hath since been seen.” Alas! while grief and fear survey the tomb, All Nature wears a sympathetic gloom. Hence, ere the valued friend hath clos'd his eyes, From every breeze we steal presaging sighs; See, cold and sallow, the forsaken grove, And hear lorn fountains wail o'er those we love! END OF THE THIRD CANTO. CANTO THE FOURTH. ARGUMENT. 1. Description of Andarton after the Death of Sir Humphrey —Neville and Ned Jerkairs joint Trustees of Allan— Miss Prue and Jenny Jerkairs superintending the Economy of Andarton-house.—2. Allan preparing for Oxford, and waiting on Squire Squintal, who sends him to the Filbert Bower—Meeting there Juliet, Squire Squintal's Daughter, and Emma her Companion—Seizing the promised Purse—Allan at Oxford.—3. Death of Neville—Exultation of Ned Jerkairs on the Occasion—Character of Squintal —of his Wife Alice—of Juliet her Daughter—of Sir Harry Hawtrap. Yes! to the eye of grief Andarton wove A sickly foliage thro' the sighing grove; And each faint blossom seem'd to close in death Its silver whiteness and its fragrant breath. The enkindled lawn in sudden gloom grew cold, And shivering arbours dropp'd their buds of gold; As the Knight's oak, where vernal radiance play'd, Wrapt its fair honours in a duskier shade. Yet, as with gradual stealth the silent hours Sunn'd the weak leaf, or dew'd the drooping flowers, Thro' breaking shadow bade the grove resume All its young verdure, all its recent bloom, And e'en that oak, amidst the sylvan ring, Wave its green branches to the laughing Spring; Andarton clasp'd with joy its rising care; The good Sir Humphrey's image in his heir. O'er Allan, pleas'd his virtues to descry, Delighted Neville beam'd the guardian eye; Tho' little prompt to bend a pliant knee To Ned the attorney nam'd a joint trustee. Indeed, as well might chaos mix with light, As Neville's soul with sniveling Ned's unite. And, as Sir Humphrey's inconsistent plan O'er all the country, raising wonder, ran, Andarton-house two female inmates view'd Adepts in art, and saw new mischiefs brood. Lo, while indignant Neville purs'd his brow And bit his lips, and scarce vouchsaf'd a bow To those bright inmates; the complacent pair With lowlier curtsies, and a gentler air Hail'd his lov'd presence; bidding pleasure dart To their sweet eyes from each exulting heart! Yet there, tho' Neville with a hasty stride Oft shook the room, yet lapp'd in silken pride Tripsey with cool indifference stretch'd her jaws, And Malkin arch'd his back, and smooth'd his paws. Now Allan, as impatience wing'd the hours, With a young ardour look'd to Isis' towers; When, blending with his love the sage's lore, Of wisdom Neville pour'd the precious store. “With joy, my kinsman! I behold (he cried) “In thee paternal worth, paternal pride— “That sense of ancient honour, glowing-bright, “Those generous passions that impel thee right, “Those firm opinions cherisht not in vain, “That soul which looks on dastards with disdain. “Thy father never to the ignoble stoop'd, “Tho' by mean characters too sadly dup'd. “Detecting specious vice, in lofty strain “He talk'd, and sharply satiriz'd chicane: “But, the short effervescence o'er, he griev'd, “And deem'd himself by passion's mist deceiv'd; “Dismiss'd his censures as replete with gall, “And lent, from the full heart, his hand to all. “Hence hath he nam'd, with Neville joint trustee, “That whimpering knave, that fawner for a fee! “Yet, by the insidious Jerkairs undismay'd, “Confide in Neville's firm protecting aid. “Go then, my boy, thy steps where Isis calls, “And heed with due regard her cloyster'd walls: “Be, still, thyself: Truth's open path pursue; “And all thy virtue dictates, dare to do.” Kind as the drop that pearls the roseleaf, stood In Allan's eye the tear of gratitude. But, as he mus'd on all the parting scene, A softer passion seem'd to creep between, And breathing an adieu to fancy dear Dried in its silver sluice the generous tear. And, tho' full soon Sir Humphrey's dying bed A chill of terror o'er his spirit shed; Yet a fond plea from Beauty's glance he stole, And in the dear deception wrapt his soul! Now Squintal, who a visit had vouchsaf'd To his lone mansion, sweated, swore, and chaf'd, As, a pale sufferer from rheumatic pain, He press'd his couch of down, and press'd in vain; When, with the grin that marks a miser's joy, And with a hasty squeeze, he hail'd the boy; Ask'd, with his wonted enigmatic look, ‘If, in the lane, he met no nutting-crook?— ‘Held common hazels hardly worth a rush; ‘And (beating all so quaint about the bush) ‘For filberts bade him seek the garden-ground; ‘And, with a laugh averr'd, were never found ‘Nuts half so glossy, not in all the dells, ‘So ready at a touch to slip their shells.’ Obedient to the hint, the boy was there, And in the filbert-bower surpriz'd the fair. With roseate fingers there had Juliet wrought A purse endued with fond impassion'd thought. And lo, its glittering folds as full in view She held, and oft its strings of silver drew, From Allan's presence with the feign'd alarm Of a fond maid she shrunk on Emma's arm, And with a threatening glance the boy repell'd, While all her bosom indignation swell'd; Tho' Emma, pleading in persuasive strain, And pleading for the lover not in vain, Bade Juliet with a smile his pardon seal; A smile more fickle than the veering gale. “Well, Juliet! if the sinner thou receive, “Some little token of thy pardon give— “Confer, to keep for better or for worse, “On parting Allan, the long-promis'd purse”— When pausing, as in jest the purse he seiz'd, While Juliet shriek'd, and Emma star'd amaz'd; And, “Ah, capricious girl!” with quick adieu Exclaim'd, and from the bower of beauty flew. Yes! 'twas a promis'd purse with passion linkt, A purse instinct with fire, with soul instinct: For there had Juliet's bosom learn'd to glow, To breathe in purple or in silver flow. There, with a gradual heat had young desire O'er the soft silk effus'd a lambent fire; There, ardent sighs imbued the fluid gold, And gentle wishes heav'd in every fold; And Hope o'er all its fairy lustre shed, Swell'd at each stitch, and danc'd from thread to thread There jealousies had o'er the tissue skimm'd, And each bright spangle for a moment dimm'd, And fluttering fears had imp'd their feeble wings, And died entangled in the trembling strings; While, bath'd in kisses the delicious snare, Young Love, not Plutus, lurk'd in ambush there. Tho' nurst by Cam poor Herbert's fancy runs On Johnian problems and on Johnian puns; Yet Neville, partial to “the mighty Tom,” Bids him conduct his pupil to the dome Which Wolsey rear'd—yet plann'd with ampler sweep With walls to frown magnificently deep, And all the pomp that gothic grandeur pours From fretted minarets and massy towers. There, Allan's lively genius, ill confin'd To rules that suit the dull mechanic mind, Scarce brook'd the task, to meet the peep of dawn, Along the far-extending terrace drawn, As chiming bells the hour of matins told, And in the dim aisle deprecate the cold; Again, his terrace-walk, returning, take, And with his cap in hand, obeisance make To graduate student, if, far off, he see Some student of a cap-a-ble degree; Mount to his spider-loft, where George so brown May haply, midst the crazy china, crown His dusty table, and his quivering fire Quench'd by the o'erboiling kettle erst, expire; For scout in vain with lungs exhausted whoop, Then seize his slate and join the Euclid-troop, O'er squares and circles and triangles doze, Or tremble to the lecturer's twanging nose; Thence with slow step his classic tutor seek, And sweat and fume and stutter o'er the Greek; Once more retir'd, against intruding folk Shut with decided hand his door of oak, Mend his silk hose, from shirt the damps expel, Tho' barberless, yet catch the dinner-bell; At length, with countenance reliev'd from care, Welcome the spruce adjuster of his hair; Amidst the hall where savory viands rise Perhaps with mouths of hunger sympathize; Tho' on economy young pleasure trench, His troubles in the purple nectar drench, Or, as his hours in sober sadness pass, Now nod, now sip a solitary glass; Assist, at Tom's, with capillaire, or toast, The shrewd conjectures of the Morning Post; “Conscious of clean band stiffly starch'd,” defy The keenness of the pert proproctor's eye; Thro' High-street flaunt his sleeveless gown, and stroll Till, beating on his ears, the Tocsin toll; To vespers damp with tardy pace repair, But soon from chapel into genial air Descending, hail, without a moment's halt, The soothing influence of the kitchen vault; On the long table stor'd with dainties, gaze, And, lost amidst the culinary maze Of roast or boil'd, or bak'd or potted meat, Cull the nice morsel for his nightly treat; To his short commons oft invite a friend; Perhaps an hour of social comfort spend; And, parting, in his little cabin close Each college care, and sink to sound repose. Yet hodiernal custom reconcil'd To “dull mechanic rules” his genius wild; As powers surpassing his, dispers'd the beam That gilded the fine form of self-esteem. But still a something which his looks betray'd, Too plain, involv'd him in its gathering shade— A something daily deepen'd on his brow, Dark as the cloud that speaks a broken vow. Perhaps, 'twas self-reproach his sorrows bred; The conscience of affection rashly fed: Perhaps, 'twas doubt that waver'd in suspence Between low passion and the sacred sense Of filial love, while rose his sire to view, And o'er the unhallow'd flame chill shadows threw. Thus, as the prophet's tomb that seems to slight The earth, yet gains not an ethereal height, Whilst Allan hung; he met a sable seal, A black-rimm'd sheet, to tell some direful tale; And, as his palsied hand unclos'd the sheet, Totter'd, afraid to look, on feeble feet— Then caught the fatal words, “departing breath”— And snatch'd a short relief at Neville's death. Alas! how soon that glimmer of relief From sickly fancy, was immerst in grief. Where, Allan! now the guardian's fostering wing Shall comfort to thy careworn bosom bring? A Neville's rare integrity impart Its manly vigour to thy wavering heart? Alas! to plunge thee still in deeper woe, Shall Scorn or harsh Unkindness aim the blow? Shall squinting Treachery, studious to supplant The fairest hopes of youth, thy dwelling haunt? O say, shall Persecution, at thy gate, Menace a dread variety of fate, To daunt thy spirit and thy soul oppress, Or make thee firmer by each new distress? Soon as the sad event Ned Jerkairs heard, He smooth'd his neckcloth and he stroak'd his beard; And hemm'd; and musing, for a moment, sat, And with malignant triumph seiz'd his hat; Quick to the townclerk (now his neighbour) sped, And glad announc'd the news of Neville dead. “Hah! (cries old Squintal) what a five-barr'd gate? “Ned, you remember, I foretold his fate. “The gout”—“Well, well, whatever was the cause, “We know, my friend, (then stretch'd his yawning jaws) “The Andarton-messuage, and its nonsuch heir, “Devolve at once to thy protecting care. “I warrant it, by dint of kind advice, “We'll teach the little swaggerer, in a trice, “Tho' a rare nursling of the heroic brood, “No more to bluster o'er plebeian blood.” Not that from root plebeian Squintal sprung, But, to his hearers prompt to tune his tongue, To low born Jerkairs would obeisance pay, Echoing Ned's notions in a servile way; And, if Sir Harry's pomp illum'd the street, Cry down poor pedigrees as obsolete. Tho' blending in his bile-discolour'd face The German dullness with the French grimace. Of the fine arts an amateur profest, He shone the virtuoso of the West; As round the circuit of a spacious room He rang'd, from Bulmer's press, each gorgeous tome, And purchas'd for his rich port folio, prints Or etch'd, or grav'd in stroke, or aquatints; So that his levy (all the town can tell) Was grac'd by many a beau, and lisping belle. While townclerk of the borough, scot and lot, In Molfra, to secure each dubious vote, 'Twas his to bribe, and bustling, to a blaze The election-spirit by a breakfast raise. Late too, the colonel of a troop, he shone, To military tactics vastly prone; And fond his warriour-genius to display As mock fights glitter'd to the beams of day, Oft from his high-plum'd steed the field harangu'd, Or fiercely rush'd where bloodless armour clang'd! See, at his beck, young Pug the pestle quit, While maladies or cease or intermit; And, at the word, heigh-presto! heigh-begone, Old Jack the grocer, start up Captain John; And Ensign Bob, dismissing all the clerk, His parchments pale abandon with a jerk! Nor more the slippery brethren of the quill O'er shrivell'd deeds, in sunless holes, sit still; But to their recent coats attention win As each, a sleek young serpent, casts his skin, Kindling in burnisht glory, glides along, And brandishes abroad his double tongue. Big with the intelligence of Neville's fate Old Squintal bounc'd into the room, where sat His wife with face no terrors could unhinge, His placid Alice much amus'd with fringe. “Bless me, poor man!” in gentle tone she cried, And with glib fingers still her shuttle plied. Meek woman! so inur'd to self-controul, What ills by others felt can move thy soul? Thy smiles to all alike so prompt to lend, Say, does thy kindred bosom boast a friend? Say, while thy charity so kind, affects (As inuendos touch thy tittering sex) To disapprove each hint of blame, so nice, Lest censure Virtue's form mistake for vice; Say, tho' so tender of a sister's fame, So fond to vindicate an injur'd name; Wilt thou devote one atom of dear self- To save the life of any mortal elf? Not clad in smiles insipidly serene Did Juliet move thro' being's dull routine. Her sparkling animation oft entranc'd The social circle, if a look she glanc'd: And, as her airy spirits mounted light, If woe drew near, she flutter'd at the sight. If Alice pass'd a piteous object by, Whispering—“Poor creature!” with just half a sigh; Struck by her mother's apathy, o'erflow'd Her eyes with tears, her cheek with blushes glow'd. And all the vicious ready to condemn, And, e'en of censure to protract the theme, The little quick enthusiast wont to stare, Oft as her mother with so mild an air, With such a modish negligence of tone Gloss'd o'er a crime, resolv'd to slander none. Now, while a livelier ray from Fancy stole, Amidst the fine emotions of her soul, As from some recent source surcharg'd with sighs Her bosom heav'd, and teardrops fill'd her eyes, To her lone chamber would she oft retire; There, at her window fix the Eolian lyre, Wait the low warblings of the dulcet breeze That first seem'd wasted from the wavy trees, And with poetic transport all her own Catch the wild note, and drink the dying tone; Or melt with feelings only lovers know On Otway's tender traits of female woe, Or the poor solitary plaint assuage, The heartsick pang by Burney's magic page; And with light hand her elegant guitar Attune to every soft impassion'd air, As from her bower, for love and fancy's sake, She hail'd the shadowy turret, the clear lake, Or, on the floor of moss beneath her feet, (What time cool evening bath'd in many a sweet The sleepy bells of sinking florets clos'd) Her eye, oblivious of the past, repos'd; Tho' soon that purse surcharg'd with hopes and fears Chas'd from her lids the dream, and summon'd tears. Nor seldom the sly Alice would intrude With stealthy footstep on her lovesick mood, While Juliet, heedless of the observer nigh, Still mus'd, then, starting, met her mother's eye, Or, dropping with incautious haste her book, Shrunk from a rigid frown, or icy look. “Poh! poh! romantic maid!” would Alice say, “You know, full well, I disapprove a play, “A novel, or a tune to touch the heart. “What! with imaginary sorrow smart? “Amidst a world where ills too sore are rise, “Shall griefs from fancy spring to poison life?” In truth, as Juliet with increasing years Still more dislik'd the face that coldness wears, She flew from every petrifying glance, And barter'd genuine feeling for romance. Meantime, Sir Hawtrap to his highbred air, And of his equipage the dazzling glare, Had drawn old Squintal lost in idle gaze— A moth, perhaps to perish in the blaze! Ah! while the attraction was in wealth alone, Around his rising walls, the piteous moan From many a ruin'd cottage pierc'd the skies, The wail of shivering eld, and infant cries. Scarce had Treglastan its new master view'd, Ere, strait unpillar'd at his nod, was strew'd Its hoary mansion o'er the extensive ground, And little cheerful cabins, scatter'd round, (Their thatch grey mosses creeping to encrust) Were, at his lordly mandate, laid in dust;— Ere, with dire crash resounded in the breeze Its venerable rows of rushing trees, And, whether dale or hill their gloom o'erbrow'd, All—all its scarlet oaks in terror bow'd. Yet, as the new-rear'd fabric proudly stood, Bare to the winds where whilom tower'd a wood, Tho' fine pictorial art, perchance, repaid By varied beauties the diminisht shade; Vain was each rural charm, to chase Ennui From the void bosom, or from conscience free The petty tyrant who, engirt with slaves, Still long'd, on British ground, to trample graves. What tho' the verdure of the velvet lawn O'er fencelorn fields with gradual softness drawn, Shone tinctur'd to the morn, and each cascade With all the colours of the rainbow play'd; Yet, to his pillow nail'd at least till noon, 'Twas his to slight “dame Nature's ready boon,” Nor rise till the sun left his southern throne, The Andarton dinner-bell announcing—one; When, breaking in full glory on the day, To venal Molfra would he whisk away, And, from his flaming phaeton superb, Each poor pot-boiler dazzle or disturb, O'erwhelm a curate, heedless whom he crush'd, Or sweep, whole off, a penthouse as he rush'd; His steeds of lightning in a second stop, And pay due homage at each paltry shop; With adulation raise a vacant stare On the sleek forehead of the butcher mayor, In gentle accents to the cobler cringe, The joiner's frame with fine new words unhinge, And creep into the grocer's heart with ease As mites in secret undermine a cheese, On tanners practise many a slippery wile, And melt the man of tallow with a smile, (Protesting, as he plied his fresh attacks, Each lustrous candle sham'd the whitest wax) And lo, to close his compliments, invite His friends to dinner, at the approach of night. Nor, on the townclerk, e'er an errant tool, Pour'd he by niggard drops his oil of fool; Oft as on Juliet with too fond desire He look'd, resolv'd to circumvent her fire, And, ere his infant myrtles form'd a shade, To Cyprian pleasure lure the unpractis'd maid. END OF THE FOURTH CANTO. CANTO THE FIFTH. ARGUMENT. 1. Meeting of the Demons adverse to the House of Andarton—their Machinations against the Heir.—2. Jenny Jerkairs employed as their Agent—her Plot communicated to her Brother, Ned Jerkairs—3. Allan's unexpected return—Changes in the House and Family of Andarton. ‘'Twas on that spectred eve when Cornwall fills With sacred light and joy her echoing hills, As sudden thro' dim ether they upraise Their hundred heads and tremble thro' the blaze— 'Twas on that eve the demons, in a file Of hostile front, to Karnbre's druid pile Rush'd forth—fell spirits of the rocks who share The dreadful charge of pestilential air, Who, dipt in magic fire, fierce arrows waft With keener vengeance than the lightning's shaft, Dismantle, at their will, the sylvan scene, Lay bare the metals that a mountain vein, And prison the rude winds in caves, or urge Their rapid eddies thro' the roaring surge, The fiends who cower on Brendon's misty brow, And mark with wicked eyes the woods below, Their fluttering wings on Menadorva spread, And shrink with dances proud Penmennor's head, Or, as around them boils the foamy spray, Invest Penolva with a crimson ray, Who for the merchant-sail from Aldren's height Cast o'er the green expanse their straining sight! There, too, the valley-fiends their pennons furl'd, And phosphor-tipp'd, the watery besom whirl'd, They, who the meadows intersect, and stain Pure founts with tin, where lurks the ruddy grain, Who Ardevora sweep with troublous flight, Or rich Barallan's reddening harvest's blight, Or with dire breath pernicious mildew spread Where sweet Rosvallan pour'd its purple shade, With heavy clouds Lambessoe's birch o'erwhelm, Or wild thro' Hellan fire the towering elm! And, lo! the sprites of subterraneous glooms Ascending from their mines, the sullen Gnomes Who far within thro' earth's recesses walk Where granite glitters from its silvery talc, And midst cobaltic walls, or gleaming grey Or dusked azure, wind their dreary way, In antimonial cells who shun the light, And in the paths of bismuth hoary-white, With iron bands the solid mountain brace, And store the glossy tin beneath its base, Murmuring amidst the copper's dun abodes Guide the swart miners to its deeper lodes, In rocks of alabaster scoope their caves While, far above, the hideous cataract raves, And, as its lustrous bloom elusive flies, Catch the fleet silver with lyncean eyes. Such was the throng; when, midst the mystic gloom, Mounts into ether a tremendous dome; Dense walls of sulphur in a moment glare; Basaltic pillars shoot aloft in air, And, mingled with columnar crystals, rise To prop a lava roof that mocks the skies. Lo, whilst the tufa-stone, the pumice light In various fretwork trembles from the height, The pavement floods of molten bloodstone lave, And round each column wreathe a crimson wave. High thron'd in granite a carne-spirit rear'd His agate sceptre proudly; whilst appear'd Circling his head, a stone ring azure deep, In which a yellow serpent seem'd to sleep; And thus: “Ye fiends of carnes, of vales, draw near— “And ye who fill the subterraneous sphere. “'Tis your's, for aye, against the fields of light, “O'er Cornwall hovering, to exert your might, “To thwart the enfeebled Genii, who preside “With flagging pinions o'er transmitted pride, “Stout oaks to destine for the briny flood, “And sport in triumph o'er a crashing wood; “To speed the venom that a streamwork wafts, “Delve the deep clay, and pierce thro' hills in shafts. “'Tis your's, where Avarice eyes his mouldering hoard, “To stain the escutcheon of the rustic lord. “Know then, a fit occasion waits your spleen, “Where Feri guard yon old umbrageous green. “Know, late, a Knight who priz'd his generous blood “Hath, dying, left that venerable wood, “That castellated mansion to the care “Of minds but ill affected to the Heir. “Go, then, and fire them with abundant schemes “To dissipate the boy's romantic dreams: “Bid them, assailing the too sacred place, “Each friendly spirit from the chieftain chase, “Whether it haunt the hoary-whispering grove, “Or whether it regard his future love.” Then, rising more distinguisht than the rest, Another demon of the carnes address'd The throne, and wav'd on high his feathery crest. “Ye mountain-fiends, your Prince's nod attend, “Yet to my sovereign skill your favour bend. “'Tis mine to prosper all the sons of trade, “And o'er vast seas expand the pendant's shade. “Behold ye fiends! my power for ages great— “'Twas I, who guided to this lone retreat, “'Twas I who guided to Cornubia's isles “Phenician fleets, and bless'd their dangerous toils. “'Tis I, who in the spiced Indian air “Sit on the yellow sands, the first to rear “The British flag, and speed with homeward breeze “The embarked traders o'er the silky seas! “'Tis I the merchant's embryo schemes o'erlook, “The nurse of commerce in its Cornish nook. “'Twas I, who bade a Nabob cross the deep, “To where Cornubian castles idly sleep, “Old Geoffry with the flatterer's arts invade, “And teach him the prerogative of trade; “But chief from slumber wake Andarton's wood “Where stagnates in dull veins Patrician blood. “And be it your's, ye Demons, to suggest “Such projects as may break that torpid rest.” “Agreed!” a scowling Gnome replied—“agreed! “And how to execute the glorious deed “Be mine to tell: To every word give ear, “Ye Demon-tribes, and shudder as ye hear. “Long since 'twas known that woman best could sow, “Brought from the infernal world the seeds of woe. “Attend!—Of late, a foe to many a dome “Of high Cornubian fame, the tyrant Gnome “With Cornish families fell war to wage, “A dreadful plague created in his rage. “A cauldron, bubbling blood that warm'd a wolf “He seiz'd, and slung it o'er a flaming gulf; “And blew a blast that fiends can only blow, “Till all the red volcano roar'd below; “Then in the vase an adder's venom'd tongue, “The brains and bowels of a traitor slung; “The spawn and entrails of two dozen snakes, “Of sulphur, hot from Erebus, five slakes; “The stings of hornets and the forked claws “Of owls; from female corpses the shrunk jaws “(Jaws that in life were shrivel'd and worn sharp “By pale detraction ever prone to carp “On worth) of rankest envy the black lips; “The poison that from toads the nightmare sips; “Then stirr'd the mixture red with sin and strife:— “And Jenny Jerkairs, chattering, sprung to life! “Such be the incarnate spirit we employ— “A form, to palsy every earthly joy.” He ceas'd; and breath'd such fine metallic fire As mortals taste, and tremble and expire: The grateful fragrance cheer'd the infernal rings; And each glad genius clapp'd his ebon wings; When, twinkling from the sombrous adder-stone That circled the rock-spirit on the throne, A yellow gleam was, three times, seen to glance, The well known signal for the demon-dance. Sudden, the palace vanish'd from the gaze, And, at a hundred carnes, round every blaze The whirling fiends appear'd, in many a fearful maze. Her tongue, now weary with its flippant play, Pale on her pillow Jenny Jerkairs lay; Effusing from her mouth the fumes of shrub— The infernal nectar quaff'd by Beelzebub; When, issuing from a sable mist, she saw A lurid hand her shivering curtain draw, And, as she felt a quick spasmodic twitch, View'd, slow-emerging from his cloud of pitch, A form, more dreadful than the Theban sphynx, With bat-like wings, with eyes that mock'd the lynx: And, as his tawny lips of shrivel'd skin, Swell'd, like a bladder, from the breath within, In short shrill shrieks she heard, or seem'd to hear, Accents unmeet for other mortal ear.— Struck with a thousand schemes the maid awoke, Whilst thro' deep clouds the struggling moonbeam broke: And, on her restless pillow as she toss'd, By all the mischiefs of the Gnome engross'd; On her pock'd cheek her transport cast a gleam, And flush'd with cruel fervours every seam. Strait as the dawn had stain'd its eastern gloom, She flew, impatient, to her brother's room; And said, ‘How glorious o'er the subject sea, ‘She mark'd, in vision, many a lofty tree; ‘And mutter'd that Andarton's oaks would move ‘Along the billows a distinguisht grove; ‘Told, how in morning slumbers she survey'd, ‘Where long had wav'd the unprofitable shade, ‘The hills, the vales with mineral treasure dight, ‘As Genii drew the lurking wealth to light; ‘Averr'd she view'd those hills, that dormant ore ‘Laid bare, to swell their friend the merchant's store— ‘Laid bare, to fill their friend the Nabob's purse, ‘Loading the hapless Heir with many a curse; ‘And whisper'd various motives, to detach ‘The whimpering Allan from his lovesick match.’ Whilst not a hint was lost on brother Ned, He flings the nightcap from his drowsied head, With ready stomach to digest her dreams, And ruminates unutterable schemes. Now hastening to the merchant, to submit Each lordly tree that seem'd for felling fit, His ears from every hill-top caught the crash, How pleasant—to produce young Allan cash! Now speeding to Treglastan-dale, that gleam'd With granules in its ruddy torrent stream'd, He bade the Nabob prosecute the plan Where the same rivulet thro' Andarton ran, And e'en the rich metallic vein pursue Thro' fields above where fruitless timber grew: So, while each tinwork crown'd the Nabob's wish, His ward should welcome gold in every dish. Stung with new projects as he told his route, Wildly the sister-furies bounc'd about. “Lord!” (Jenny Jerkairs cries, with triumph mad) “I long to mortify the hectoring lad “Who doats on his old groves of trees, his lawns, “And talks, forsooth, of parks and frisking fawns “Such as, in ancient times, Andarton grac'd— “Soon shall he see his lands a mining waste. “And soon another noble scheme, I trust, “Will bring his soaring spirit to the dust. “Squire Squintal, to be sure, a little sly, “Casts on Andarton-grounds a cunning eye, “And, therefore, Juliet for the boy designs, “To these hoar woods to link Trevalso's mines. “Yet with Squire Squintal and the boy, you know, “No love is lost: 'tis easy, then, to blow “The dormant sparks of hatred to a flame— “Such, such, my brother, is the task I claim: “And every thought of Juliet must your ward “Amid the strife of houses quick discard. “Nor shall my pains be spar'd, to disconcert “His soft amours with every romping flirt; “For if he die without an heir, Miss Prue, “My friend shall hold the manor—You know who!” With gentle inclination of the head Prue thank'd her friend, and smirk'd on uncle Ned; And each, well met, their malice as they nurs'd, Gloried in all the feelings of the curst! Such were the mischiefs in each bosom ripe, When, prompt to seize Andarton at a gripe, As the pale wretch that flies the lightning storm, The poor intriguers shrunk—from Allan's form! How chang'd that form! By warring passions checkt, No more he trod with manly port erect. Fled was that bloom, where erst so sweetly play'd O'er his warm cheek the light pubescent shade. Nor less disfeatur'd was the seat serene Of harmony, Andarton's quiet scene. Scarce in his absence had the varying year Thrice bloom'd and faded to the solar sphere: Yet Allan notic'd with emotions strange Thro' all the household a portentous change. Where now the butler grey could Allan hail, Bent on his crutch, and stor'd with many a tale; Where meet, in solitary wisdom sage, That last left relic of Sir Humphrey's age? Alas! he hail'd, with tresses silver-hoar, That quaint historian and his staff no more. Alas! where'er he turn'd, with sickening sighs He met the stare of cold or curious eyes— Met the bluff groom, and dizen'd out with lace Pert lacqueys, strangers to their master's face, And sluts that brush'd along, and look'd askance, Sly gipseys tutor'd by the girl from France; And, where the glimmering wainscot mourn'd the blaze That o'er its pannels flung no friendly rays, Where beam'd no look benignant, to impart A social spirit to the mantling heart, Met the dark frown, and caught the insulting tone, The cold sarcastic sneer, from all but one! Nor did his eye with rapture's glance survey The level walks that sparkled to the day, Where the green moulder on the gravel spread, As gathering insects shap'd their earthy bed; The lawn, that whilom lull'd the ruffled soul In soft repose, upheav'd by many a mole Where now thro' thistles sprung the seeded blade, And trembling fescue with the burdock play'd; The mead, whose fount no more to radiance fleet Down the young verdure pours a glittering sheet, Or parts its waters into silver threads, Where dank and sullen vegetation spreads; The grove, whose dark luxuriance from the beam Now shut the mossy sward, the struggling stream; Where to the blooms along its margin born The clear rill blush'd with every tint of morn! And once, how pleasant at the close of eve Its tinklings sweet, the cool romantic cave, Where now rank nettles chill'd the untrodden ground, And spotted foxgloves hung their venom round. Yet, unsuspicious of the menac'd stroke, He hail'd, still vigorous every veteran oak; Tho' oft alarm'd, he listen'd to the breeze That bore hoarse murmurs from the heaving trees; Invisible as hostile demons flew, And Fayes their cohorts into crescents drew. Yet, water'd by its old meandering rill, He hail'd each dale beneath the umbrageous hill; And, heedless there how far their foliage stray'd, View'd the same aspins shiver down the glade; Tho' oft, when evening still'd the glimmering air, He saw strange phantoms rise, and tremble there, Now dart o'er all the marsh an azure ray, Now sulph'rous glide, now purplish faint away; As many a valley-fiend with treacherous aim Laugh'd, where the vision rose, and ting'd the flame. END OF THE FIFTH CANTO. CANTO THE SIXTH. ARGUMENT. 1. Death of Harriet, Mother of Allan.—Ned Jerkairs reprobating Allan's unexpected return from Oxford—Allan's projected Tour, chiefly with the View of visiting Landor-abbey on the Banks of the Tamar.—2. Allan setting out on his Expedition —Passing by Trevalso, and observing in the Garden Juliet and a strange Lady of uncommon Attractions—Pursuing into a Glen the flight of a Falcon, and discovering, near a ruinous Chapel, a Coffin, and in the Coffin a human Skeleton—Drawing from the Finger of the Skeleton a topaz Ring, and struck by its posey—Recognizing Emma's Cottage hard by—following Emma into the Cottage—acquainted by Emma with the Name of Juliet's Visitor, viz. Laura from Landor-abbey —dropping the Purse that he had received from Juliet in the Cottage, and departing with Precipitation.—3. Near the Cottage, Allan meeting with Ned Jerkairs—Ned complimenting the Hero on his Knight-errantry. Still was there one, assiduous to impart The tenderest balm—a kind maternal heart! Still was there one, whose timid meekness, scorn'd By the proud twain, had long in silence mourn'd; Who, with a gentle spirit too deprest, Had stor'd her sorrows in her angel breast, And now, with every look affection wears, O'er Allan melted in unwonted tears. Sweet thro' those tears as smiles of pleasure ray'd, The hollow of her hectic cheek betray'd The cankerworm, there fasten'd to consume The last faint relics of her lovely bloom: And Harriet, who had thus in secret sigh'd, Bow'd her submitted head, and calmly died. Meantime Ned Jerkairs, from whose visage dark Of smother'd anger broke the frequent spark, And disappointment struggling thro' its mask; And pride imperious that appear'd to ask A base and servile homage, to excuse The boy's desertion of his college-muse, Address'd, with eyes that flash'd indignant fire, The curate, yet unweeting of his ire. “Gods! when, by all thy wishes value most, “I bade thee teach him (almost every post) “To check the bias that to Cornwall tends, “And fly the meanness of provincial friends, “And strait the wayward boy, too soon of age, “With projects of a foreign tour engage; “Is it thy sapience dares obstruct my schemes, “And lure him down to cherish lovesick dreams?” But by his bosom-feelings urg'd alone From academic-gloom the youth had flown, Resolv'd to stifle in his glowing breast A boyish passion that had banish'd rest; While, shunning as in scorn the silbert shade, His duteous love a dying fire obey'd. 'Twas at this moment, with the adroitest aim, Good Herbert strove to stir the adventurous flame That long had languish'd, faint in beauty's rays, As embers sicken in the solar blaze. “What (Herbert cried) if round Cornubia's coast “We ponder on chivalric virtue lost; “Tracing the hoar remains of castle-walls, “Monastic structures or romantic halls; “And, as we cross old Tamar's wizard tide, “View, still untarnisht, Landor's lordly pride?” With exultation the caballers heard The scheme of Cornish castles, and averr'd All love for Juliet was, besure, extinct; Yet, in the bonds of dark suspicion linkt, Agreed, the step was dangerous, to relax Their vigilance, or spare their sly attacks. Scarce had the youth resum'd his highborn pride (Herbert, his honest Sancho by his side) Ere, passing the nun's wall, that stoop'd to lave Its browner ivy in the shadowy wave; He notic'd, thro' the sprays of tremulous larch That floated at the window's fractur'd arch, The pensive Juliet and a stranger fair— Her mien how graceful, how divine her air! And, spurring his fleet courser down the dale, Rush'd, in the conflict of his passion pale; Nor mark'd the morn's grey mist in soft relief, But slighted all the scene, absorb'd in grief; Till full display'd a falcon urg'd its flight, And thro' mid ether bath'd its plumes in light, Then cleft a cloud beyond the hero's ken, And, earthwards glancing, pierc'd a gloomy glen. Wak'd to the heroic sense, with eager eyes He saw a pinnacle dispart the skies, And, o'er the glenwood, to its garment grey Of moss quick-kindling, catch the solar ray. There Allan hied, and nodding to its fall Found the last fragment of a chapel-wall, And, fast-beside, with matted briars o'ergrown, A coffin of enormous size in stone; Where, as its lid was open'd to the day, A skeleton in grimly slumber lay, And on his finger to the explorer's sight A ring by fits betray'd a golden light. Elate with hope, impatient at the view, The ring from off the finger Allan drew, Nor shudder'd, tho' the hand asunder snapp'd, And unseen pinions all the coffin flapp'd, And the corse rose, as lifted from beneath, With bones that crackled and with chattering teeth! Strait on the rim, with still untrembling frame, He read these lines in characters of flame: “Take this, my valorous youth! If this thou wear, “Thy bosom shall despise the vulgar fair; “Each dark design evolve, and render vain, “And the high lady of the cloyster gain! “Yet must thy hand, ere yet the virgin bless “Thy peerless worth, the patriarch sabre press.” Then rush'd into his mind the topaz pale That from Sir Humphrey drew the eventful tale; What time the dusky portraits they survey'd, And gaz'd on great Sir Andar's sombre shade. Now Allan, half-recover'd from surprize As down the dale he cast his curious eyes, And, conscious of his course turn'd back again By the fierce falcon and the ruin'd fane, Began to recollect the willows hoar, The brawling torrent, and its rocky floor; At little distance a light figure saw, A graceful gait, a rustic hat of straw; Cheeks crimsoning, like the orient day, perceiv'd, And scarce 'twas Emma's maiden blush believ'd. With all the sweet simplicity of truth, The virgin welcom'd home the embarrass'd youth, And pointed to her roof, where grey the smoke Aspir'd, a pillar thro' the branching oak; And, gliding strait away to lift the latch, The hero beckon'd to her humble thatch. Enquiring, whether Juliet breath'd a sigh To love, he read reproof in Emma's eye: But, asking with a more collected air, ‘Who, who with Juliet was the stranger-fair?’— He learn'd, 'twas ‘Laura from the cloyster-hall, ‘For whom, Sir Harry to a fancy-ball ‘Was now inviting all the gentry round’— Whilst Emma's modest glances met the ground. And, pensive as he ponder'd o'er the cot Whispering—‘Still sacred is a certain spot ‘Where once so quaint was crown'd a rural queen; ‘But Emma, sure, forgets Andarton-green— ‘Long since hath died a wreath that pleasure wove— ‘So perish, my sweet girl, young joy and love’— A look, as if by stealth, the virgin flung Where from a smoky beam the garland hung; And, as her eye she rais'd to florets sear, Stole from its shaded lid a silent tear. Whilst thus his restless spirit sought repose, A fine sensation in his bosom rose; And, with a fluttering hope that seem'd to spring In wild illusion from the mystic ring, Again the posey kindling round he read, And dropp'd his purse at Emma's feet, and fled. The flying youth had just re-cross'd the brook, When Ned the attorney, from a shadowy nook Sprung with his spaniels, stepp'd in wonder back, Then with a loud horselaugh resum'd his track. “Aye! this is fine knight-errantry, my lad, “Damme, my boy! I thought thee castle-mad, “Resolv'd to brave the necromantic shade, “Storm the dark tower, and free the captive maid! “Besure, the sport's as great, the danger less, “To comfort cottage-damsels in distress!” END OF THE SIXTH CANTO. CANTO THE SEVENTH. ARGUMENT. 1. Allan, in consequence of the Lady of Landor-abbey's Visit to Juliet, abandoning his Project, and returning to Andarton— There meeting the Rector Swellum, Prue, and Jenny Jerkairs—The Conversation of the Rector, and the two Females repulsive to the Feelings of Allan and Herbert.— 2. Preparations for the Nabob's Ball in compliment to Julia— Allan at the Ball—Various Characters there—Portrait of Laura—Juliet's growing Affectation—Juliet refusing her Hand to Allan in the Dance—Miss Prue's Party to Church in honour of the Rector—A Sunday-evening Concert—A Tinmine visited by Allan, Laura, Emma—A Pilchard-Seine —Emma dropping the Purse by accident, in presence of Juliet, &amp;c. &amp;c.—3. The Incident of the Purse confirming every Suspicion of Allan's Infidelity and Emma's Guilt. Confus'd and silent, as the hero fled The gibes and glances of sarcastic Ned, ‘Rather,’ thought Allan, ‘had a threelane ghost ‘The road, his hands imbrued in carnage, crost! ‘Alas! the gathering fiends my projects mar, ‘Darting malignant beams from every star ‘Yet now, perhaps, the destin'd lady waits ‘My homage, nigh my own paternal gates.’ There, as he re-appear'd, exclaim'd Miss Prue, “What, back again? And simple Sancho, too?” While, mounting to her cheeks thro' many a sluice, In livid rancour spread the bilious juice:— When Swellum (who had made his annual trip In quest of tithes) a little purs'd his lip, Yet bow'd, and somewhat quicken'd, with an air Of ease, the light momentum of his chair.— “Goils! what a fine adventure! I'm amaz'd!” The females bridled, and the rector gaz'd. The rector, who was measuring out his stuff Of modish sort, (a pleasant lounge enough) And, as he bade the gentle pair believe His fulsome lies, was laughing in his sleeve; “Why, (as I said just now) 'tis mother's wit,” Exclaim'd, “and not a fierce romantic sit “That qualifies the stripling for a tour: “This, this alone, is the true native ore “That e'er invites, amidst a foreign land, “And gains a polish from an artist's hand. “And, if his Quixotte follies he discard, “And render himself worthy my regard, “To Allan I would recommend my plan “To look at France awhile, nor slight Lausanne; “And, where no vulgar English hiss or hoax, “Give him a soft access to tonish folks. “Then with an air of fashion will he move, “Nor longer herd with rustics, hand and glove; “And, if he seek, at length, his Cornish home, “Doubtless, pull down this antiquated dome, “And, well instructed in the modern stile “Of fabrics, rear at once an airy pile. “E'en now, should those old bays, that chesnut fall, “Whose long-leav'd branches overshade the hall; “And light should enter these unsocial rooms, “Nor comfort be devoted to the glooms “Of moss-grown arches dank and diamond panes, “And the dull pondering upon dusky stains.”— “Ah, (whisper'd in soft tones the admiring niece) “Too much is old Andarton of a piece. “But such the strange delirium of the youth, “He calls ‘an ancient tree—a friend,’ forsooth; “And, rather than his chesnuts slight, or bays, “Would live, immur'd in darkness, all his days.”— “My fine old mansion-house at Gruntley-dale, “Like this, was only on a larger scale: “But soon the gothic shadows I discuss'd, “(Its massy turrets crumbling into dust) “And rear'd a dome magnificent, yet light, “That overlooks from Nature's proudest height “Each hamlet glittering thro' the morning-mist “Where in smooth verdure winds the vale of Clyst. “Indeed, my drawings, exquisitely fine, “Of Gruntley-dale display the grand design: “And of my lawns and wildwoods, ever new, “How sweetly pencil'd is each varying view. “There, to this day, where-e'er I turn mine eyes, “A thousand points of beauty still surprize “My mind, and bid me with the enthusiast's glow “The pencil seize—and, ladies, a-propos! “Your smiles would give a finish to my groves, “And win to every bower the laughing loves!” Prue bow'd her head, with odd affections smit, And Jenny Jerkairs, in a kindred sit Unable to contain herself, sweet nymph, Betray'd her crisis in a trickling lymph. The rector, who had guess'd, with looks demure, The fine effect of gratitude so pure, As still, the gentle maidens to amuse, He seem'd to fumble for his pocket-views, Resum'd, full soon, his wonderous tale of self; A tale he told to every mortal elf. At length, exhausted from his self-applause, He ceas'd, and, after an emphatic pause, Stretch'd out his legs, and yawning with an air Egotic, to the curate cried: “Prepare “Your pupil, Herbert, for my travelling scheme, “And wake him from his wild heroic dream. “Teach him the urbanities that now embrace “New men, alike, with those of ancient race: “Tell him, indeed, in this enlighten'd age, “The manners of the merchant oft engage “Our liberal homage, tho' we meet with scorn “The narrow notions of the nobly born. “Bid him no more survey with scowling eyes “The opinions or the fashions as they rise; “Nor deem the luxuries of the polisht, crimes, “But bend with due submission to the times.” Quick on his heel the reddening curate turn'd, And with an honest indignation burn'd. “What! shall I sacrifice to Fashion's rage, “To the false tenets of a vicious age, “Each good old maxim that our fathers lov'd, “Each usage long by Wisdom's self approv'd? “What! shall I hold each homebred virtue vain, “And Dissipation court with all her train? “O, while I deem my cassock no disgrace, “From Allan may I bar an upstart race, “Who, wont o'er every varying clime to roam, “Have lost the sacred sense that cleaves to home, “Licentious notions with their wares import, “The sons alone of gay profusion court, “With philosophic minds enlarg'd, despise “As Superstition's chain, the Christian ties, “On holy rites opprobrious terms bestow, “And fly a churchman as their deadliest foe. “Tho' never may Sir Humphrey's heir contemn “The merchant merely of ignoble stem, “Yet may, in him, his father's feelings rate “Worth with patrician blood as truly great; “And point his aim, where Virtue best aspires, “To a long lineage of ingenuous fires.” “Fool! (cried the rector) din my ears no more “With nonsense! How incredible a bore! “Say, had no wandering upstarts left their homes, “What magic could support your hoary domes? “And, but by them, what ancient house enjoys “The varied luxuries of earth and skies? “Could high Andarton's lords, without their aid, “Have strutted, deep in ermine and brocade, “Or e'en their liveried menials shine in lace, “Or their proud steeds expire amidst the chace “When little vanity beholds and brags, “The tails of foxes or the horns of stags? “Say, tho' your gallery boast an aweful name, “Frowning on light saloons of modern fame; “O say, what mimic pencil could unfold “Its drapery, or of silk or woven gold, “But for those arts that give the woof to glow, “Or with rich colouring mock the braided bow? “Perhaps, tho' dozing thro' the year supine “By rule exact you rise, by rule you dine, “You triumph in the generous soul that rays “Its favours o'er a few on festal days! “Yet, lo! from each contracted usage free, “The sons of trade but emulate the sea, “As riches still unceasing they diffuse, “Or shed their blessings like the silent dews! “Those antique notions to disperse in air, “Break Custom's yoke that only minions bear, “On freeborn man expand an equal ray, “And give the social passions room to play, “While such the power thy tribes, O Commerce, claim, “Shall old Andarton bow its head with shame!” Meantime, had busy murmurs fill'd the dome, And the light maiden skipp'd from room to room— Here whisperings in a consultation grave, While feathers at each breath were taught to wave; There sighs that heav'd the gossamery gauze, And the short laugh as prescient of applause; And gentle rustlings, as the bandbox pours Its crapes and paduasoys and silver flowers. And what, in truth, could such attention call, Debate so serious, as the fancy-ball? Miss Jerkairs felt as erst, the tragic sire, And Prudence walk'd at least six inches higher. Miss Prue, indeed, poor damsel! had been sick, As amorous cunning plied each pretty trick. What tho' her little winking eyes, so weak, Gleam'd on the moles that etch'd her sallow cheek; Yet striving the poor rector to entrap With glances soften'd by her waving cap, The girl had languish'd for a sweet love-tale Amid the secret bowers of Gruntley-dale! But, by the rector for the ball engag'd, Her bosom with triumphant ardour rag'd. Yet scarce had the good females to themselves Devoted a few hours, ere, generous elves, To Allan they propos'd, with kind regard, The acceptance of the Nabob's friendly card— Subjoining, with a soft submitted air, Trevalso's people are expected there— ‘And Lady Laura's form, by Fashion grac'd, ‘May win some notice from a man of Taste.’ Tho' Allan saw in each unwonted smile But ill conceal'd the subterfuge of guile, Yet curious, Lady Laura to survey, And fond, perhaps, to catch one parting ray From Juliet's eye, he lent the according ear, And met from both the involuntary sneer. Not that the Nabob he was prompt to court, Too mindful of the proud insulting port: But, crossing strait his own too wayward will, He wish'd his sire's injunction to fulfil, As all the homage due to rank, he paid To the high lady, to the abbey-maid. The thrilling night arriv'd: 'twas Saturn's night; What time the rural fashionists delight To imp their plumes, and mock with empty scorn The sacred opening of a Sabbath morn. Innumerous lustres flung a dazzling light O'er stairs, that wound in waxen polish bright, To where vast Indian monsters, taught to sprawl In red and azure, deck'd the glaring wall. As pass'd young Allan with a decent pride Along rich sophas rang'd on either side, Strait beelike buzzings thro' the ballroom ran, And a soft whisper breath'd from many a fan. In one wide brilliance burst upon the sight Forms of all sorts by various Fashion dight: Here, kindling its thin gauze the bosom bare, And floating o'er its bloom, luxuriant hair; And, from behind, desiring eyes to check, The truss'd-up tresses, and the cranelike neck; Or insect shapes, by prudish Folly brac'd; Or bedgown figures loose without a waist; Or maids who, sick'ning thro' their rouge, betray'd The hollow cheek where green chlorosis prey'd; Or those who, plaistering o'er their furrow'd skin, Would to the doll-like daub the Cupids win; Or waists awry but ill-conceal'd from sight, Or elbows that the modest eye affright; Or mimic breasts of pasteboard round and plump, Or wriggling for the dance the corken rump. There too, amidst the splendour, men or apes Look'd grave or gay, exhibiting their shapes. A few, above the rest, attention won To outrè character, caprice, or ton;— This, tho' a priest, who stoutly damns the church, And leaves his charge, a letcher, in the lurch, Who oft by gout condemn'd to painful nights, Yet, spouseless, rails against the nuptial rites, And, with the first fruits of good living stuft, Ogles a well-bred whore, and hunts a tuft— That, who, a squire amus'd by various whims, Thro' all the round of dissipation swims; Yet, tho' he glitter at each public place, Dance at each ball, or bet at every race, Yet, in a dissipated age how rare, At Church he never slights the hour of prayer, And, as his pencil's heavenly groupes attest, Shines, to all eyes, the Raffael of the West. His foes indeed (and he has many a foe) Attribute all to fashion, form or show. ‘Whether (they cry) the Proteus pray or paint, ‘The flatter'd amateur, the sniveling saint, ‘Observe him, in his changes, where yon will, ‘'Tis ostentation, form, or fashion still.’— And next another, whose vociferous strain Betray'd a dreary vacuum of the brain, Whose laugh, tho' meant to mark a lucky hit, Yet only shew'd his wond'rous lack of wit, Whom blustering, other fools have often check'd, But blundering, fools alone would dare correct— Another, foremost of the sons of guile Who met each welcome with a specious smile, And, as the well-concerted tale he told, Suspicion lull'd, and e'en the wise cajol'd! Not thus in promising exterior smooth, But like the ruddy yeoman of the booth, And rough to fashionists, perhaps, at first, As in the haunts of some lone mansion nurst, A gentleman appear'd, of ancient birth, Who in the genuine heart conceal'd his worth. But, by the hands of love and fashion drest, A female tower'd, distinguisht o'er the rest. Tossing her ostrich-shadow'd head, she flung Now smiles, now frowns on youths that round her hung; Whilst the fierce brilliants of her wide bandeau With flashings dazzled each attracted beau. Nor wonder that the fluttering youths survey'd With love, the beauties of the splendid maid— The large tall form, whose majesty controul'd The gaze, full eyes that darted as they roll'd Pernicious lightnings, or voluptuous play'd As her dark eyebrows arch'd their meeting shade; Fair temples azure-vein'd, the Grecian nose, And heaving breasts that too luxurious rose; A rich-zon'd waist where trembled young delight, And graceful arms that beam'd with rosy white; And all the gestures that the soul ensnare, The step of elegance, the modish air. Frolic and arch, around her fond to waft Her favours, or capricious as she laugh'd, Perchance her favours fonder to withdraw And strike the sneakers of the crowd with awe, She triumph'd in the credit or the guilt That marks the sly deceptions of the jilt. Nor while the plumage of her head she toss'd, And of each youth the love and fear engross'd, Did envy slumber in the female groupe, Nor vanity that gave them, cock-a-hoop, To ape her negligence of dress, of air— A model they might copy to a hair! Alas! that charming dress, nor loose nor trim, That set, as if created for each limb, O'er all her polisht form that waving line Which language idly labours to define— That Proteus of inimitable ease— Alas! the fleeting vision who could seize? Fill'd with soft witcheries, arm'd with aweful scorn, 'Twas love and grandeur hail'd their Laura born. Tho' less a fashionist, a lovely girl, Her hair inwreath'd with flowers, and deck'd with pearl, To Laura talk'd, scarce heeding what she said, And with a childish folly winc'd her head, Laugh'd at mere nothings, hand and glove with rank, And stole from affectation many a prank: At every sentence, now her tongue let slip, Low as the whispering breeze, ‘your ladyship!’ And now pronounc'd, as more familiar grown, ‘Laura, dear cousin!’ in distincter tone— When Allan, all amid her feverish trance Met from her eye a cold contemptuous glance, And from her lips in censure seem'd to hear, As Laura's laugh half-smother'd struck his ear— ‘Yes! yes! it was a less adventurous lot! ‘We dubb'd him the knight-errant of the cot!’ And, doubting whether yet he heard aright, Caught, still more audible, ‘the cottage-knight.’ With all the flush that crimsons guilt confus'd, A moment wretched, tho' not self-accus'd, He stagger'd and retir'd; then strove again To brave each glance, but felt his effort vain; Till onwards, by a sense of duty borne, And pride resolv'd to punish Juliet's scorn, With one bold struggle he retrac'd his way, To Lady Laura his devoirs to pay; Yet, as he saw Sir Hawtrap quick advance And lead out Lady Laura to the dance, To Juliet bow'd, and losing self-command, Ask'd with faint voice the honour of her hand, But strait, as passion trembled, to convulse Her frame, was answer'd by a stern repulse. The sun now rising, and the dancing clos'd, To some selected friends Miss Prue propos'd A scheme to Pleasure's votaries new and strange— ‘To church to make a party’—said, ‘The change, ‘From a gay ball to prayers was dull enough,’ But whisper'd, that ‘the doctor would shew off,’ And ‘to Andarton to conclude the day ‘With music, begg'd they all would bend their way.’ The hour arriv'd: the bells began to chime, And the tower-clock announc'd the lapse of time; And Herbert in the spirit 'gan to groan, Viewing the pews all crouded—all but one, Where its snug chimney cast unwonted rays To kindle up the solitary baize. And long, midst many a yawn, the chimney drew Cold damps that chill'd the green-invested pew; When Herbert, all impatient to begin, And from his head avert the doctor's sin, Rose with an air that indignation spoke, And in slow tones the sacred silence broke. Now the first service o'er, the gallery rang From rustic noses to the harmonious twang, To viols mingled with the female shriek, And hautboys taught like sucking-pigs to squeak; When sudden a long rushing sound was heard, And the quick glitter of the train appear'd— Fellows, whose boast—the staring city-face— Was crown'd with all the consequence of lace, And next the fair with steps that rank assumes, With light veils floating and aërial plumes, And bustling far behind, as if to bilk His eager flock, the rector rich in silk. His part, for tittering and each rattling fan Scarce Herbert could perform, when, lo, began The farce.—Behold his pew the doctor leaves, And strutting in the pomp of pudding sleeves, With gait important tho' well-nigh a dwarf, Exhibits to the crowd his staring scarf; The pulpit with an air devout ascends, Propp'd on a stool with adoration bends; Recites the collect with low voice, and next In energetic tones repeats the text, As if he acted an apostle's part Twice uttering—“I am lowly, meek in heart.” Yes! thou art meek, poor self-dejected thing, Witness the sparkling of thy diamond ring, That to thy fine white hand attention draws, And to thy graceful gestures steals applause; Witness those solemn emphases that roll With deep persuasion round, and trance the soul; Those artificial falls that o'er the throng Slide in soft music from thy silver tongue; That oratorial pause which oft affords Some little respite to thy swelling words! And what thy topics? Lo, the moral sense, The glorious light that Nature's works dispense; And reason, that rejects with proud disdain The atoning Saviour—topics after Payne. Clear'd for the concert was the golden room, Whilst brightening lustres broke the cobweb gloom Where paroquets had scream'd and lapdogs slept, And monkeys had so long their sabbath kept. Say, Jenny Jerkairs, whence the wild caprice That stirs the placid bosom of thy niece? Wrapp'd in a cloak of satin lin'd with fur As on the concert-room to cast a slur, Deckt with a warm Elizabethan ruff, And up to elbows in a sable muff, See Lady Laura from her carriage swim, The child of spirit, ease, and frolic whim; And hear her cough apologize for dress, That seem'd to cause a delicate distress. “Lord! what a shivering church! How dear we pay “To hear a prebend preach, a curate pray! “But, Juliet! let us haste to join the throng, “Smit with the love, it seems, of sacred song.” Yet soon was Handel to the shades dismisst; And, such as modish taste could ne'er resist, Light airs and glees, and soft enticing trills Promis'd to pierce the soul with pleasant thrills. “The ladies, who alone can banish care, “Will each oblige us with a gentle air,” The rector, of his post a little proud, Exclaim'd, and first to Lady Laura bow'd. Amus'd by all the levities of chat Close to her ladyship whilst Allan sat, My lady with a sportive smile obey'd; And such a witching meltingness display'd, Such wantonness, as if lascivious fire Her soul had ravish'd from Anacreon's lyre. The hero blush'd, and bow'd, and blush'd again; Thank'd Laura for her fascinating strain, But begg'd to deem her, with the doctor's leave, Too sweet a syren for a Sunday's eve. Behind the benches as he seem'd to sneak, In vain the little doctor strove to speak: But Laura, with a gay good-humour'd tone, An unembarrast manner all her own, Said, that ‘a favour she had meant to ask, ‘Still flatter'd he would not decline the task— ‘To shew the process of the Cornish tin; ‘If, peradventure, 'twas no heinous sin ‘Touching his tender conscience with alarms, ‘On Monday morn to meet a syren's charms.’ Next morning, Allan, at the appointed hour, Hands Laura to her phaeton and four, And to his vast surprize, the timid grace Of rustic Emma meets in Juliet's place; Beside them, as the silver axle rings, With Emma's lightness to the seat upsprings, And (on his courser catching Hawtrap's eye) Bids the fleet steeds across the common fly. Soon as they reach'd the region, where pale dearth Appears to mourn the disembowel'd earth, Where Cornish zephyrs are content to waft The sounds of whirling whims from shaft to shaft, And turbid streams thro' dull morasses flow, Where vegetation never learn'd to glow, He stopp'd; and with his charge o'er fractur'd ground Sought a deep shaft that yawn'd terrific round. The Nabob, who in breathless haste advanc'd, On her odd freak a gentle censure glanc'd; Said, ‘She complain'd of cold the night before, ‘Tho' now she dreaded not a dismal moor ‘Where such fine eyes had never shed a ray, ‘And urg'd her to retrace the dreary way.’ “No—no,” (she cried, with mystic meaning arch) “Be mine this morning an infernal march. “Come, then, my Indian chief, without a joke— “Conduct me to the subterranean folk.” His terror to disguise, the Nabob laugh'd, Confess'd, he seldom had disturb'd a shaft, But hop'd, ‘'twas badinage—Her self regard ‘Would quick such whimsies from her mind discard.’ “Then, Allan!” (cried my lady) “let us go”— (And slily wink'd) “the brave, the brave, you know.” Whilst off flew Hawtrap with a thrilling oath, She hasten'd down the ladder nothing loath; At the first landing view'd the impending height, Now distant from the beams of balmy light, Pac'd with a steady step the platform round, And from the bottom as she caught the sound Of labouring pickaxes, still ventur'd down Three lengthsome ladders, ere, her wish to crown, She saw rich masses by the glimmering lamp Whose sickly rays scarce pierc'd the somb'rous damp. Half-cover'd by her huddling cloak, her face Look'd like the sweet Madona's pictur'd grace: The miners, strait respiring from their toil, Grin on her beauteous form a ghastly smile, And soften'd by the music of her voice That gives each high-roof'd echo to rejoice, The various mazes of the mine explain, Huge rocks burst open by the nitrous grain— Dire glooms, where ochrous waters slumber'd dank, Now hissing to the chain's enormous clank While the vast prowess of explosive steam Whirls to the ethereal arch the foamy stream, And where amidst the perilous abode Gleams, in its long dun path, the lumpish lode. Thus, whilst gay Laura trac'd the mineral shade, A white-hair'd spaniel sudden joy betray'd; Lick'd Emma's friendly feet, and jump'd around, And with loud barking bade the vault resound, Ran to a peasant half conceal'd from view, Then back to shrinking Emma wildly flew. “Heigh, Emma!” (as he mark'd her downcast eyes, Cried Allan) “what, a lover in disguise? “Tho' woman may her bosom-feelings masque, “A dog not seldom answers all we ask.” Safe with her squire escap'd to genial air, Hied to the smelting-house the valorous fair; Where, as in wide extent the furnace glow'd, Metallic masses, bright in fusion, flow'd; And in the dye huge blocks lay cooling round, Or to each stroke return'd a ringing sound, Glitter'd, along the pavement, to the sun, Or on the backs of mules far blazing shone. Now as the steaks that kiss'd the steaming blocks, Sputter'd and whizz'd, like Abyssinia's ox, Old Geoffrey's savoury treat upon the tin Her ladyship partook without a sin. The gentry seem'd, all union, to agree That such a scheme was only markt for glee, But, striving to disperse their grief or spleen, Discover'd the vain effort in chagrin; And most, Sir Hawtrap; who, extremely grave, Could scarcely Laura's penetration brave, And e'en into a mousehole could have crept, When, ‘for her sake, she begg'd he would accept ‘A specimen of Cornish metals, fine ‘And fresh, he might depend on't, from the mine.’ “As Laura seems to relish, well enough,” (Cries Allan with a smile) “our Cornish stuff, “Suppose, if morrow evening set serene, “We show her ladyship the pilchard-seine?” Mild was the morrow's eve; yet dense the shade Of broken clouds, where pale the moonbeam play'd. The party, all assembled at the beach, Look'd down the bay, as far eye could reach, To where the seiners, winding round the shore, Whistled blithe songs, or plied the dashing oar. Now, as more near their nets the sein-men drew, Where redness speck'd the sea's extensive blue, And shoals on shoals, along the watery way, One vivid crimson, colour'd all the bay, And silvery streams, where erst the surge was fir'd, Flash'd o'er the boats and quiver'd and expir'd; A thing that seem'd but trivial, discompos'd The curious gazers, and their pleasure clos'd— A trivial thing that slipp'd from Emma's hand (Too careless maid) and glister'd on the sand; Whilst conscious Allan started at the gleam, And Juliet utter'd a distressful scream, And trembled the whole groupe, they knew not why— The purse of love—betray'd to every eye! Yet Emma, flutter'd by a moment's fear, Dismiss'd the fleeting tremour in a tear, And on the ground her eye serenely cast, Its lustre sparkling—for its cloud was past. Allan! what apprehensions to thy heart Could from the purse one casual glitter start! How many a dormant thought, the wizard snare That talisman of love, awaken'd there!— Alas! so strange his first emotions rose That scarce he deem'd (till reason, to compose His spirit came) how stain'd with deepest dyes From perfidy, he stood in Juliet's eyes; Tho' Emma, to censorious tongues betray'd, He mourn'd, and melted o'er the faultless maid! END OF THE SEVENTH CANTO. CANTO THE EIGHTH. ARGUMENT. 1. Disappearance of Emma and Herbert—Report that the former was pregnant, and that they had absconded together.— 2. Allan, canvassing the Scot and Lot Borough of Molfra—unsuccessful —Sir H. Hawtrap and Squintal elected Members for the Place.—3. Allan musing on the Cliffs near Andarton —and observing Sir H. Hawtrap and Juliet seemingly on the most familiar footing. While now distrustful glances Allan cast On those soft days in dissipation past, Ponder'd o'er Herbert's spirit, Swellum's pomp, And Laura, the light child of ease and romp, And Juliet darken'd by a cloud of spleen, And Emma's eye dejected tho' serene; And yet, reflecting on each fleeted day, Labour'd to steal a reconciling ray From all his forc'd devoirs, to Laura paid To please a dying parent's honour'd shade; Sudden, ‘the curate, tho' a saint,’ he heard, ‘Had e'en with pregnant Emma disappear'd;’ And, catching now the slander as it flew New edited, and much enlarg'd from Prue, Was told, ‘that Herbert, better skill'd to lure ‘A girl into the toils than serve a cure, ‘Had play'd the pander to his pupil's lusts, ‘Tho' urg'd, perhaps, himself by carnal gusts;’ And found, at length, no two reports agree To fix, whose right the byblow yet might be. But in the neighbour town a rumour rose To draw attention from his private woes— A rumour strange, ‘that almost every vote ‘Pent up in populous Molfra, scot and lot, ‘Was brib'd, Halvenna's lineage to supplant’— A race that, from its charter's ancient grant Thro' ev'ry age hoar Molfra could attach As by some magic, to its mud and thatch. Meantime, a message from Halvenna came That to the borough pointed Allan's aim; Entreating, from Andarton's house, support, And offering him a seat in civil sort. And, lo, Halvenna's lord, to guardian Ned, To feel the borough-pulse, young Allan led, His views unfolded with becoming grace, And caught confusion in the conscious face. “My interest (cries recover'd Ned) is yours— “That interest which, behold! at once restores “Andarton to its pristine rank and rights, “And closely with a kindred house unites. “Nor need you canvass—Zounds! I've strength enough “From ev'ry vote to ward pretenders off; “Assur'd, whate'er their riches, power, or rank “Against them all to carry it, point-blank.” By Ned attended, to the townclerk next As Allan bow'd, he mark'd an air perplext That struggled between interest, spleen, and guile; Tho' to Halvenna's lord was lent the smile Which servile adulation, midst the rays Of courtly favour, to a patron pays. But waiting on the mayor, a supple clerk They met, it seems, a most obsequious smirk, Such flattering looks as scarcely credit ask, Professions smooth and soft, that deem'd no task Halvenna's favours to requite too hard, And all the current gibberish of regard. Yet, call'd to honours from a cobler's last, What priest could ponder long on favours past? The pair, now hailing whiffs from Cheshire cheese, Their homage made, with more than wonted ease, To an old townsman, who indeed deserv'd Obeisance, from plain truth who never swerv'd, Nor, tho' he spent his days amid the strife Of venal votes, was brib'd thro' all his life— Poor simple Wagstaff; who from punch still drew O'er all his honest face the poppy's hue; Who, tho' immerst in liquor every night, Yet rose, recruited with the morning light; Who, stout and vigorous at threescore, flung out At every spring and fall, a healthful gout; Still at his door, as erst, in flannel stood, And leaning on his cane in merry mood, There puff'd his pipe, nor flinch'd tho' sore attack'd, But many a joke with wonted humour crack'd; Laid hold of every gentleman he knew, And squeez'd each hand to homebred friendship true; Unskill'd to close the tale he quick began, O'er the long history of the borough ran, And, at his finger's ends each pedigree, Trac'd from its sturdy root the branching tree; And drew, as he devour'd the daily news, The glance of envy to his gouty shoes. “What!” (cry'd old Wagstaff, and his fingers snapp'd, And jump'd about, his legs in flannel wrapt,) “Zounds! zounderkins! I'm gladder than a bird!” (When now the boy's pretensions Wagstaff heard) “Why, half thy family for Molfra sat— “Sir Roger, and Sir Oliver the Fat, “And many a worthy of the Andarton-line— “But, damme, do beware of dark design. “Each day, my lad, I like the townclerk less: “Damme, I see, in every look, finesse. “The mayor too, Rehoboam's priest, by G?d! “A greater rogue his vather never shod.” Now for the election-poll the hall unclos'd, And the high business of the day propos'd, Paus'd the sly mayor; look'd round with face of brass, And cried in tones that mock'd the braying ass: “Tho' e'er my private feelings own'd, I trust, “The kindness of the Halvennas, from the dust “Who rais'd me; yet my sense of public good “Against the Halvennas turns my mantling blood. “In truth, their favours tho' we highly rate, “Their favours but a crowd of slaves create.” He spoke: and Squintal, with a stammering voice, Sir Hawtrap introduc'd to Molfra's choice; When Ned arose, that minion of intrigue, And blushless nam'd old Squintal his colleague: Strait grocers, butchers, tinmen, one and all, With acclamations shook the vaulted hall. Poor Wagstaff, in a litter thither borne, With ruddier cheeks than autumn's mildest morn, Soon of his fond delusion unbeguil'd, Now swore, now wept, now blubber'd like a child. Whilst pensive from the rocks his eyes he lifts, In melancholy mood along the clifts Where once his wild heroic rage he fed, Young Allan rov'd, by other feelings led, Thro' all the puzzled maze of treachery ran, And, pausing, trembled at the guilt of man. Calm o'er Andarton shone the closing day, And the beach-pebbles glanc'd a sparkling ray; And gentle zephyrs, midst the glow of eve, Dipp'd their smooth pinions in the purpled wave, Where the green woods, in vivid tints array'd O'er the clear waters wreath'd their silent shade; When, sudden, starting at the mellow sound Of many a mingled note, he look'd around, And saw, distended with her aweful charge, Swell into pomp the corporation-barge, And, her gay colours as she stream'd in air, Announce the mighty presence of the—mayor! Thus Argo, freighted with the golden sleece, Wav'd her bright ensigns o'er the sons of Greece. Slow mov'd the barge—to notes so loud, yet clear, That all the stream-tin imps peep'd up to hear, Whilst on each head green oysters op'd their jaws, And to the crazy fiddlers gap'd applause. Slow mov'd the barge; while some, opprest with sleep, Nodded, the Palinuri of the ship; While some, triumphant, of their freedom talk'd, Or starting from the board in anger stalk'd, Where flying glasses bitter strife bespoke, And ere the joke was crack'd, the bottles broke; Tho', as each challenge in oblivion sunk, Soft were the tears that sooth'd the crying-drunk. Fixt like a statue on the clift's pale brow, As Allan view'd the gaudy barge below, He saw a groupe of females pace the deck, And mark'd Sir Hawtrap's arm round Juliet's neck; And, as the pair in dalliance seem'd to sport, Half credited, at length, a strange report, ‘That Hawtrap, by the borough-projects led, ‘The townclerk's daughter had engag'd to wed; ‘And honest Squintal, on these terms alone, ‘For the good Nabob had the borough won.’ “Alas!” (cried Allan) “such are Hawtrap's sighs— “Such his fond languishing at Laura's eyes!” Nor had he ceas'd, when soft on air portray'd, In transient vision smil'd a heavenly maid; And, ere she vanish'd into ether cold, Beam'd azure light, and wav'd her locks of gold! END OF THE EIGHTH CANTO. CANTO THE NINTH. ARGUMENT. 1. The Genius of Trevalso presiding over Juliet's Garden— Description of it.—2. Since Juliet's disingenuous Behaviour, the Seat of the Feri usurped by Gnomes—The Beauties of her Garden faded and gone.—3. The evil Influence of the Gnome on the Mind of Juliet, in favour of the Nabob. Long had the Genius of Trevalso-dale, O'er its green meadows bade his Feri sail, Fling from its birchen shadows purple gleams, And from tall poplars sigh o'er silver streams— Long had he call'd, to please the mournful maid, To Juliet's garden-bloom, their favourite aid. Soft sloping from the hill above, (where stood The stuccoed mansion, erst embower'd in wood) The garden, still to soothe its Juliet's soul, Down a scoop'd dale its gradual beauty stole, And round an oval lake, to many a view Fair-opening, a romantic wildness threw; As a dark nunnery stretch'd its ivy deep Beside the wave with reverential sweep, And, lock'd in hoary slumber, seem'd to rest Its croslet on the water's crystal breast. O'er the smooth slope an easy pathway stray'd, Where arching myrtles wove their fragant shade; While prattled, from its pebbles, as in talk, A social streamlet with the shadowy walk; Till, at the nunnery-window's arbour-seat, The pathway melted in the dim retreat; And, as a plaintive leave it seem'd to take, The stream, in pearly lapses, kiss'd the lake. There oft the Feri, fond their limbs to lave, Would catch a sparkle from the quivering wave; And, if no imp annoy'd the spotless scene, Glance its pure lustre thro' the myrtle screen. There would they oft, along the moss-cool banks, Thro' dripping alders glide in silvery ranks; Or shoot across the expanse each little car That glow'd or glitter'd like a falling star, Or skim the violet beds with printless feet, Hang o'er each cup, and drink the floral sweet; Sleek their moist tresses, or with lilies braid, And dance amid the virgin's arbour-shade. 'Twas o'er that arbour oft their airy march They led, and, lighting on a slender larch Which wav'd the window's broken shafts between, Drew from its opening buds a clearer green; Bade o'er the rootwove seat the filbert glow, And the rich muskrose dart its blush below. There, for their Juliet, would the Feri shower Brown nuts in clusters, at the matin-hour; Heighten, for her, the mulberry's purple hue, And with nectareous sweets the grape imbue. Ah now, for gentle Fayes, the sullen Gnomes Scowl o'er Trevalso, thro' pestiferous glooms Where beechen shades emit a lucid gleam, And panting herds approach the poison'd stream. Lo, “swarthy Fairies of the mine,” they chase From the sweet garden all its charming grace, Down the slope kindle their phosphoric wheels, Or plough the foaming lake with rapid keels; And give the path to cast a sickly glare From hot pyritic fragments scatter'd there, While roses all their sickly sweets effuse, And lilies drink no more refreshing dews. And whence this wonderous change? Alas! we find Each source of evil in the subtle mind; Alas! if Juliet were ingenuous still, Her guileless soul would bar each cause of ill. Tho' mildew might the meadowy verdure check, Her garden were secure from every speck. Whilst Juliet, by contending passions tost, Her triumphs o'er the Nabob lov'd to boast, Or mourn'd her first affection sorely crost, A dark Gnome, weaving his insidious plan, The fickle maid determin'd to trepan. Amid Treglastan-vale, a pansey grew No longer boasting its purpureal hue, Tho' kindred to the little western flower Hit by love's archery in a magic hour, That o'er the streamlet rear'd its snowy head, Ere fainting from the wound it droop'd and bled. The pansey, nurs'd by many a tingrain sluice, The demon pluck'd, and mix'd its yellow juice With mineral banes, and sought the unquiet maid Who to her bosom woo'd the vesper-shade. Ah! trembling while amidst the dusky sprays Enchanted Cynthia pour'd malignant rays, Where were ye, Feri? Where, the sweet emprize To fan the livid beams from Juliet's eyes? Where, gentle ministers, your wonted skill To veil your Juliet from the impending ill? Ah! thro' the lunar beams the demon flew, And to his drug a direr venom drew; Hung, viewless, o'er her; plied his wanton freaks, And stain'd her lids with deleterious streaks. END OF THE NINTH CANTO. CANTO THE TENTH. ARGUMENT. 1. Visits of Sir Hawtrap to Juliet—Her Affectation and Caprice.—2. From the Operation of the Charm, Juliet receiving the Nabob with all the Transports of Love—Assenting to his Proposal of Marriage on a certain Day.—3. The Day arrived—The Celebration of the Nuptials interrupted by a female Stranger—who asserts that Sir Hawtrap had married her in India, and claims him for her Husband. Tho' often, from on high, the sun had seen Sir Hawtrap usher'd at Trevalso-green, To breathe his noonday sighs (not love, it seems, Could from the pillow chase his morning dreams), Yet, with no rapture such as wildly whirls Thro' regions of romance enamour'd girls, Nor with those smiles, by fashion half represt, Her suitor's fruitless vows had Juliet bless'd. For him, 'tis true, that vanity which moves The female bosom, spite of all the loves, Its cold torpedo touches would impart To numb the ingenuous feelings of her heart. Oft as his steed, curvetting at each check, Beat its quick hoof, and bent its fine-arch'd neck, And, proudly prancing, up the pavement dash'd, Or his high car the gilded glory flash'd; For him would affectation half unclose Her pretty mouth, to shew the pearly rows; Her dimples deepen; turn her head awry, And with an amorous ogle roll her eye. But from that eye would tears unbidden break, And tremble on the blush that dy'd her cheek. Now at the window with disorder'd look Was Juliet bending o'er a prurient book; Whence, with a wild impatience oft she hung, And on the road a glance of anger flung, Started at every step, at every gale, Flusht with desire, with expectation pale, And from her eyes bade fitful drops deplore Sir Hawtrap's absence never felt before; When (borne beyond herself in passion's storm) She hail'd the graces of his polisht form, Return'd each thrilling ardour as he press'd, And sent lascivious poison to his breast. But 'twas a sting of transport pierc'd the fair, The fruit of vanity, caprice, despair. Nor his fond suit, to fix the bridal hour, (Urg'd from his lips before, with feeble power) She scorn'd, but fear'd, alas! some luckless star Might rise with hymeneal bliss at war. Yet at the shrine, while fast the fever'd blood Now ebb'd, now flow'd, in terror Juliet stood. The priest began: and, eyeing oft the bride, The wedding noose the priest had well-nigh tied, And Hawtrap, ‘With this ring I Juliet wed,’ And, ‘with my body I thee worship,’ said— When, as wheels rattling at the church-stile stopp'd, A stranger lady from the carriage dropp'd, And, rushing up the aisle, her sable veil Flung off—Sir Hawtrap's lips were deadly pale— And, “Take, (with a deep voice the female cried) “Take, take, my Lord, your true, your only bride! “What tho' my cheeks imbib'd an olive's stain, “Heaven heard our mutual vows on India's plain. “But if, my Lord, you spurn me from your arms, “Regard (she op'd her cloak) these infant charms— “This pledge of love”—Her tale still prompt to tell, She faulter'd; on the floor as Juliet fell, With loud convulsive laughter fill'd the fane, And from love's altar scar'd the festal train. END OF THE TENTH CANTO. CANTO THE ELEVENTH. ARGUMENT. 1. The Flight of the Nabob.—2. Allan revisiting the Beech and the Fountain sacred to the Sports of his Childhood with Juliet and Henry, and his other School-companions—His Wish that Juliet, now deceiving and deceived, could regain her early Simplicity—A Spirit directing him to the Gardens of Trevalso; there to witness, if he please, the Recovery of her first fine Feelings.—3. The Disenchantment of Juliet. Forsaken, to the solitary gale While now Treglastan bade its portals wail, His tenants triumph'd in Sir Hawtrap's flight, And publish'd his disgrace with new delight; Where superstition shed its ghastly glare Saw demons scourge him thro' the fields of air; Or, midst the gloom of yawning mines, survey'd His body sinking in sulphureous shade. And Juliet, like a troubled stream, review'd The scene, bewilder'd from a hideous brood Of phantoms shrunk, and sore opprest by shame, Dropp'd from her tongue her truelove's treasur'd name! Now from an evening-picture Allan sought The balm that soothes to rest disorder'd thought; Greeting, as still its beech it murmur'd by, The small clear brook, that pleas'd his infant eye. “Sweet fount (he cried) to superstitious fear “Tho' sacred, more to boyish fancy dear; “Thou, who so many a merry prank hast seen, “Still sparkling from thy moss of vivid green; “Where oft, at eve, as frolic imps we play'd, “The glowworm twinkled thro' the quivering shade; “Where, to thy tinklings (then without a sigh) “Listening we paus'd, or laugh'd we knew not why. “Juliet! unconscious of disaster near “Our first fond friendship was enkindled here; “When, as we tripp'd around in thoughtless play, “Some little Edward hail'd his holiday— “Some Henry, to unite, perhaps, with ours, “His brisker fancies, his alerter powers; “Perchance, to bid my weetless bosom smart, “If jealousy can touch so young a heart. “Yes! I remember well, one vernal day, “Blithe Juliet had enclos'd, in balls of clay, “Harry my favourite comrade's name, and mine, “('Twas on the gamesome eve of Valentine) “And dropp'd the balls in this perennial fount; “When to the surface as they 'gan to mount, “To torture my poor breast with jealous throes, “Alas! 'twas Henry's name that first arose. “'Twas then impatient Juliet seiz'd her prize, “And laugh'd in freakish mood at Allan's sighs! “O could she taste (the prayer, alas! how vain) “The feelings of that precious hour again!” He spoke: and, sudden, thro' the charmed air Soft whisperings came, responsive to his prayer, And, in light slumber as entranc'd he lay, Breath'd clearer yet, and dulcet died away; And thro' the leaves above, of elfin mould, A wavy wing, half-viewless, gleam'd with gold. “Go,” said the Spirit (or it seem'd to say), “Go, seek Trevalso, on that dawn of day “When yonder planet shall, a morning-star, “Meet a slant sunbeam from the radiant car. “There hide thee in the nunnery-towers, that shake “Their ivy curtain o'er the stilly lake: “And, if thou wish, amidst her filbert shade, “To trace, unseen, the disenchanted maid, “Once more shall Allan witness, unreprest, “The first fine feelings of her artless breast.” The Sprite yet hover'd, till, across the cave The beechen foliage darkening, wave on wave, Shut every twilight glimmer from the brook; When the pure water from its bowl he took, In a moss-rose leaf stor'd the healing drops, And pass'd in triumph from the dusky copse. Soft at her window where young Zephyr's wings Fann'd into lulling sound the Æolian strings, And now to Juliet's ear with vain essay Bade the note swell, or trembling sink away, Light Ariel paus'd; and ey'd the lovely maid Low on her couch by flushing fever laid; Then near her, with a balmy pinion flew, And sprinkled on her burning lids the dew. Nor sooner disappear'd the guardian Sprite Than Juliet, waken'd to new life and light, On her pale eyelids own'd the ambrosial sweet Cool as the dream when night and morning meet; Felt o'er her firmer breast a genial glow, And down her limbs a rosy freshness flow; Nor, to herself recover'd, sunk again Amid delirious trances of the brain, But hail'd the calm reflection only giv'n To erring spirits reconcil'd to Heaven. END OF THE ELEVENTH CANTO. CANTO THE TWELFTH. ARGUMENT. 1. Allan repairing to Trevalso Gardens, according to the Direction of the Spirit—There concealed in the Nunnery-tower.— 2. The approach of Juliet.—3. Juliet meets Henry, and drops into his Arms. Long, ere the breaking morn, the hero sped By unseen Feri to the nunnery led, And climb'd the winding solitary tower; Intent, as Juliet hail'd her favourite bower, The virgin's early pathway to descry, And meet the favour of her love-fraught eye. Now the deep cloud, scarce touch'd by dawning day, Drew o'er its dusky shade a gradual grey. So still the landskape, that, in lapses clear, The sylvan brooks yet seem'd to murmur near; Tho' less and less was heard, amid the gleam Of the dun woods, each slow-receding stream; Whilst the young hare, that cropp'd the blade, with fear Listening to other sounds, prick'd up her ear; And the light stoat the paly terrace cross'd, And pierc'd the quickset, in a moment lost. Yet, cherishing no mental joy serene, Poor Allan heeded not the tranquil scene. Now here, now there by various feelings borne, By doubts distrest, by apprehension torn, Lest he should slight what seem'd his earliest love, He follow'd the strange impulse from above. Meantime, the Power who skims the kindling height, Tho' his troops fly the silvery paths of light, Ariel, in expectation hovering near, As now he saw the dawn with pencil clear The skirtings of the dense night-shadow streak, But lingering reach not the reposing lake; Yet, playful there, the star of eve survey'd With pearly lustre softening all the glade; And now, scarce glimmering on the scene below, O'er the flusht ether view'd a crimson glow;— Ariel, to meet the first red solar ray, Impatient, flutter'd up the empyreal way, And strove to freshen in the dews of air The faded brightness of the morning star; Till now he hail'd the virgin full in view, Stole a quick beam from either orb, and threw The mingled radiance from his rosy plume, Soft on her lovely lids, her chasten'd bloom! O'er all the unfolding prospect, from on high, Had anxious Allan strain'd his aching eye; And, when at length he view'd the approaching maid, To quit the turret's sullen gloom essay'd; But hung, from tremour or some magic power, In mute suspence, amidst the murky tower; Till, lovelier in a brightening blush of charms, He saw her, sudden, meet a stranger's arms, Sink on his bosom in a burst of sighs, And new delirium catch from—Henry's eyes! END OF THE TWELFTH CANTO. CANTO THE THIRTEENTH. ARGUMENT. 1. Juliet's Conduct, the Subject of Allan's Reflections—His Determination to recommence his Journey to Landor-abbey. —2. The Conspiracy of the Fiends against Allan—Misled by their Machinations, he wanders away towards the North-coast —Finds himself near an old Castle—Explores its Ruins— Seizing a Sabre, dissolves the Spell—Recovers the right Road to the Tamar—Arrives at Landor-abbey—Is welcomed there by Laura, its Possessor, and almost overpowered by her Fascinations.—3. Retiring to his Chamber in great Perturbation, he is relieved by an “airy Portraiture” that seems to float spontaneously before his Eyes—the Picture of some lovely Maid—but, he is sure, neither Laura, nor Juliet. True: 'twas the hapless Henry, whose disguise His spaniel had betray'd to Allan's eyes; Who, tho' a world of waters roll'd between, Still, where his early love endear'd the scene, Had breath'd a sigh across the stormy sea, And whisper'd to the cave, the beechen tree! ‘Yet (Allan cried) tho' long, in Fancy's wild, ‘Romantic passion hath her soul beguil'd, ‘Could Juliet cherish a clandestine flame, ‘And, with the hypocrite's illuding aim, ‘Profess her heart to other friendship true, ‘And so deceive her sire and Allan too?’ Thus while he spoke, he saw with fresh surprize, Around the ring the magic posey rise, And strait, resolv'd his journey to renew, To Landor-abbey in idea flew. But, as he strove before his mental eye To picture Laura, and her charms descry, In her the lady of the cloyster trace, And from his memory other forms erase; The obtrusive vision, still portray'd on air, Glanc'd the blue eyes and wav'd the golden hair! Scarce could he pass his gateway's whistling pile, Ere the dark fiend, instinct with many a wile, Had o'er the sunbeam hot as Sirius, drawn A lurid veil to sicken grove and lawn; Stream'd the blue sulphur; roll'd, at every flash, A rock from overhead, with horrid crash; Across the suicide's new-buried corse, Where three roads met, assail'd his staggering horse; Pointed o'er lonely wastes his devious way, And bidding mimic domes ascend to day As if his quick enquiries to assist, Chas'd from a glowing sky the murky mist. Erelong the hero, by each envious elf Misled, and now abandon'd to himself, Pursued his dubious path where Nature frowns From shaggy fens of sedge or heathy downs, Or, where sharp craggs the wrathful flood repel, Or midst the silence of the sunless dell, Or round blue quarries wide with coppice hung, Where to each hoof the slaty region rung; Till the hoarse murmur of the northern wave Bade Allan's heart with strange presages heave, And from the hoary deep arose to view Huge fragments, far outstretcht, of sable hue, That soon appear'd, where restless murmurs broke, Linkt to the mainland by a chain of rock. “O let me cross (he cried) this narrow neck, “And trace on yon peninsula the wreck “Of princely glory!” Scarce the hero said, Ere down the clift on wings of wind he sped, And clambering o'er a crag, on either side While roll'd in shadow the cerulean tide, Hail'd the vast ruin with an eager glow, And, from the dizzy height, the waves below! And (to its kindling posey as anew His monitory ring attention drew) Fill'd with a mystic fear, a mystic hope, He wander'd round the necromantic slope; Pierc'd in fond vision thro' the depth of time, And on the sanguine rampires tower'd sublime. Yet, vainly pacing, o'er the dangerous steep He mark'd with prying eye the mighty keep; Search'd the drear dungeon, view'd each hollow pass, And gaz'd on every mutilated mass; And turn'd his hopeless eye to measure back On the long ridge of rock his slippery track; When, as in sudden darkness foam'd the flood, The westering sun went down, a ball of blood. Now, as he shudder'd on the rocky verge, And shrunk aghast from every sounding surge, Where, whirl'd on high, the wave its volume spread, The broken curve descending on his head; Down dropp'd a star, and blaz'd its orb away, Where glimmer'd the stone-stairs in dark decay. He saw; tore up a step, and, full display'd, With wild emotion grasp'd a ponderous blade— A giant sabre!—Strait, the tempest died; And peaceful zephyr smooth'd the ripling tide! Shone o'er the rocks the moon, reposing mild, And all the ethereal vault serenely smil'd. No more pursued by demons, to impede His route, the hero press'd his generous steed; Till, pleas'd, he view'd a richer foliage flow O'er clefts imbrowning Tamar's wave below, And far above as starting thro' the gloom Umbrageous, the white turrets of a dome. Passing a bridge grotesque, whose arches gleam For ages moss'd, athwart the wildwood stream, He met the glitter of a gilded vane, And caught it sparkling thro' the leafy plane; Now hail'd the abbey-towers in broad display, Now up the lawn approach'd the portals grey. Soon as her ladyship the hero's mien Survey'd, where chanc'd her eye to cross the green; She threw her veil aside with breathless haste; Loos'd her jet tresses wantoning down her waist; Flung from her bosom half the gauzy shade, To amorous airs its rosy light display'd; There bade a picture set with brilliants rest, To lure the lovesick languish to her breast; As on her cheek she gave the blush to rise, Arm'd with new lustre her voluptuous eyes; Down on a sofa sunk, and lolling there With half-clos'd lids and soft lascivious air, Her pearly fingers twinkled o'er tambour; Listen'd, and every moment deem'd an hour; Tho' now, his name announc'd, with formal pride She strove to ice her look, but vainly tried, And spite of art, betray'd some strange alarms, Amidst the tumult of disorder'd charms. Nor, o'er his courteous air, his manly bloom As her eye wander'd, could she re-assume Those lively turns, that playful humour sly, Without the sweet intrusion of a sigh. While, round her dressing-room, each prurient print Convey'd to fancy the too luscious hint From the soft sportings of the Ovidian nymph— Her fine skin sparkling thro' the lucid lymph, From breathless Daphne scorning Phoebus' love, From Danae yielding to insidious Jove; She bade, with mouth half-open'd as she lay, Along the prints her careless glances stray; Then rose and seiz'd her harp, and touch'd the strings; And music trembled in aërial rings; Beam'd every limb, each graceful gesture glow'd; And o'er her form ambrosial beauty flow'd. Quick shifting from one pleasure to a new, Young Allan to a different scene she drew, Where Flora, midst the vegetable blaze, To quaint caprice had rear'd the various maze; And bidding him, beneath the inwoven shade That on the path's obscure meander play'd, O'ertake her if he could, strait glanc'd from sight, But gave the dancing sprays to mark her flight. Yet, tho', where'er she flew, the quivering leaves Rustled as when the branches Auster heaves; He threaded every sinuous path in vain, To the same alley oft return'd again, Her robes of snow detected as they gleam'd, And seem'd to clasp her form but only seem'd; Till, gliding thro' a gloomier oaken shade, On a moss-seat he caught the panting maid. When now the hero to his room retir'd, With many a loose imagination fir'd; Desire's impatient throbbings to restrain, “The vision” fleeted o'er his mind again. “Mysterious Fate! If Laura claim my sighs, “If Laura be the cloyster'd fair” (he cries)— “Say, what this form of bright ethereal mould, “That comes uncall'd, and waves her locks of gold;— “The angelic shape, air-painted, yet so clear, “Tho' unsolicited, to fancy dear? “No Laura blushes in the timid maid; “Nor Laura's eyelash boasts so sweet a shade! “Alas! so lovely whilst she swims on air, “Nor Juliet's image hath attractions there!” END OF THE THIRTEENTH CANTO.

A Figure very similar to the Picture on Allan's Fancy, gliding through the distant Aisle.—3. Lady Laura, in pursuit of Allan, finds him in the Chapel. Pensive amidst the grove had Allan stray'd, Where, frowning thro' a mass of ashen shade, Rose, with long cloysters lin'd, a dusky pile; When strait he cross'd a wall-flower-mantled stile, Approach'd the unclosing door that mix'd a moan With every gale, and hail'd a bending crone Who now with sudden agitation swept The pews, now pausing from her labour wept. Struck by the marble monuments sublime, Here green, there tawny from the touch of time. Struck by the rich illuminations wide And pillars by their dim reflection dyed; Struck by the pond'rous armour that aloof Thro' cobwebs glimmer'd from the rafter'd roof, He question'd much the dame, who rais'd her eyes In mystic silence broken oft by sighs; Who, yielding to the youth's entreaties, told Romantic stories of the days of old; The history of the house of Landor trac'd From recent stones to tablets half-effac'd; And, in the trophies from the roof-work, read Memorials of the venerable dead. “There,” (says the crone) “so runs the historic tale— “To the first earl belong'd that rifted mail; “The mail which, furious in the fight, he wore “When in his fortress, red with vital gore, “To his two sons he gave”—with instant scream She shudder'd as amidst a frightful dream, And cried—“that ring”—with wild emotion clasp'd Her hands, and tottering as in terror grasp'd The pew.—“Full often have I seen,” (she cries) “Where in yon oratory yet it lies, “A kindred ring. There many a lagging year “I liv'd, and dropp'd the solitary tear; “Till a dark deed, to blot the fairest fame, “I witness'd, and alas! partook the shame. “Long, long—compell'd to fly this cloyster'd gloom— “I pin'd, and languish'd for my native home; “But more, far more I panted to disclose “The dreadful mystery of unutter'd woes.— “O! if I read aright, to thee belong “The qualities that claim a trusting tongue. “A stranger to the hospitable board, “My late poor master was a travel'd lord. “Oft, with my lady, ere the marriage-rite “Confirm'd their loves, he revel'd thro' the night; “Nor, till the fruit of lawless love was born, “A bouncing lass, was fix'd the bridal morn. “Scarce had nine moons the nuptial day o'erpass'd, “Ere from debauch his lordship breath'd his last; “When quickly in the straw my lady died; “And her poor babe” (the dame exclaim'd and sigh'd) “With doubtful symptoms of the vital breath “Thro' me was order'd to the house of death: “Tho' the base aunt (who what she fear'd believ'd) “A sign of life with anxious eye perceiv'd, “And led me to my cot, some deep resolve “In agony long seeming to revolve; “Yet, not for murder ripe, if vital air “It breath'd, consign'd the infant to my care; “And seal'd, the secret never to unfold, “These lips, alas! these guilty lips with gold; “Dispatch'd me to a place obscure and lone, “And bade me nurse the orphan as my own. “Still, troubled by her sense of guilt, she paid “The frequent visit to our quiet shade, “And seem'd to catch, amidst the gloom of guile, “Some comfort from the babe's unconscious smile. “Thus fleeted a few years; when (dark the day!) “My little prattler, sudden snatcht away, “Left me, once more, alas! to silence brib'd, “To mourn the assassin's stain afresh imbib'd. “But, if repentance can erase the dyes, “Hither, at length, I ventur'd in disguise, “The whole important secret to reveal, “Should kind occasion but my lips unseal. “And Heaven, indulgent Heaven my prayers hath heard— “For not a moon had vanish'd, ere appear'd”— Faint on her tongue the faultering accents died; As sudden thro' the dim aisle seem'd to glide A female, vestur'd in the purest white; Her fleeting figure gossamery-light; And Allan in surprize her angel-air Survey'd, and trembled at her golden hair! In wonder mute as Allan gaz'd (the maid Retiring to the chapel's inmost shade) To Lady Laura, breathless in pursuit, Exclaim'd—“Say, whither ran the graceless brute?” And, resting on a tombstone, flapp'd her fan, And winc'd about and cried: “Thou slippery man!”— When a pale statue seem'd to roll its eye, And breathe along the aisle a deepening sigh; And, from the corslet, clanking overhead, A radiance, like a passing spectre, fled. END OF THE FOURTEENTH CANTO. CANTO THE FIFTEENTH. ARGUMENT. 1. Miss Prue, Jenny Jerkairs, and Alice, assembled at Andarton—Surprized by the sudden Appearance of Allan and his Bride, and Herbert and the old Nurse of the Abbey. —2. Allan, introducing Emma to the astonished and disconcerted Females as his Wife, and the Heiress of Landor.— 3. The Genius of Andarton addressing Allan, foretelling the Prosperity of his House. Loud thro' Andarton's hall re-echoed mirth, Such as to hollow pleasure owes its birth; While now the conscious couple strove to kill The creeper Time, anticipating ill. There Alice, who had join'd the plotting pair, Their feverish dissipation prompt to share, At Allan's boyish whims appear'd to flout, In wonder at his odd Quixotic route; And bore in each surmize an active part— Whilst inbred terror quiver'd at her heart. Tho', as obstreperous laughter follow'd wit, Conjecture triumph'd in the lucky hit; Yet apprehension seem'd to wrap the room, At many a silent pause, in murky gloom; Till Jerkairs thro' the cloud, like lightning broke, And thus address'd her tabbies half-in joke: “Ah! my poor pets! ah! whither shall we go— “Where shun the vengeance of the menac'd blow;— “Ye dear companions of my earliest age “Who my sick mind from sorrow disengage; “Whether you purr, applausive of my wit, “Or strike your feet in ire, or hiss and spit, “Wash your prim cheeks, as brooding tempests move, “Or, vagrants of the night, make cruel love; “Or flash your glaring eyeballs in the dark, “Or from your back emit the electric spark! “But, thee my bosom-sighs, Grimalkin! hail— “(Why wag, my Tabby, that indignant tail?) “Thee, with thy springset claws in velvet sheath'd, “And coat so sleek and whiskers finely wreath'd! “Whom oft with silver whitings have I fed, “Then bore thee to thy sweet Valerian bed.”— Thus o'er their wanton tricks and dark amours Glib as she ran; at once the unfolding doors Disclos'd, in wondrous picture, to the view A groupe, divine as Raffael ever drew— The heroic Allan and his Abbey-bride!— (Sunk into silence every murmur died—) And Herbert and the Nurse!—without a sound Each tongue, suspense terrific trembled round. Yet, as with searching looks the demon pair Stray'd o'er the beauties of the blushing fair, View'd her bright form that mock'd the roseate hours, And ey'd her golden tresses twin'd with flowers; Lo, by a sudden gust of joy o'erborne, They recogniz'd the peasant bride with scorn, And by a beam of bastard pity, mix'd With malice (as it were) the youth transfix'd. But, struck by a keen shaft from conscience pale, Old Geoffrey's wife her sins essay'd to veil In a broad stare; then, starting from the crone, And starting from the bride, look'd woe-begone. “Hear” (as they shook with sympathetic fears) He cried—“a tale to tingle in your ears! “Well, Alice! may thy nerves with horror start “To front this witness to thy treacherous heart!— “Thou, who, the blackest schemes inur'd to brood “The base goatsucker of thy brother's blood, “Couldst a poor babe yet breathing vital breath “Eject, and in thy breast consign to death— “Couldst spurn, with beggar-girls condemn'd to roam, “This rightful owner of the abbey-dome— “Couldst Laura foster with perfidious smiles, “ To snare her virtue ply thy secret wiles, “And with malignant hope the moment wait “To cast the spurious offspring from thy gate, “Then at the abbey grasp, thy guilty claim, “To elevate with heiress—Juliet's name— “In Emma see thy niece! In Emma own “That heiress!—tho' thy crime can aught atone? “Lo every scheme recoiling on thy head— “'Twas by thy artifice that Emma fled! “Nor, fell detractors! had the wandering-fair “By slander pierc'd, abandon'd to despair— “Nor had she, reaching her paternal home, “Her nurse discover'd in the cloyster-gloom; “Had not the banisht Herbert, to reclaim “His broken fortune and his injur'd fame, “Her route by chance pursued, and where she stray'd, “With friendly succour cheer'd the drooping maid.” Torn by the fangs of rancour, shame, remorse, Now poppy-flusht, now pallid as the corse, The females from his aweful presence fled; Not as the roebuck seeks the sheltering glade, But, as the tigress from the hunter flies, Still flashing vengeance from her sanguine eyes. 'Twas at the vernal prime, when zephyrs meet With feeble wing the winter's arrowy sleet, Light o'er the unclosing leaf, the purpled spray A moment tremble, and a moment play, And, raindrops tinkling thro' the sylvan calm, Dart the quick blush, and breathe the fleeting balm. To Allan's eye yet full the foliage flow'd; Along the lawn a green luxuriance glow'd; While airs favonian over carmine blooms Shook the rich nectar from their streaming plumes. With transitory murmurs tho' the blast Thro' the hush'd air a chilling shadow cast, Where the cold lilacs shew'd the uncertain scene, And the first spring-flowers shivering peep'd between; To Allan smil'd the ethereal arch more blue, And each soft shrub was cloath'd in amber dew; The primrose glow'd in golden radiance bright, And snowdrops dipp'd their bells in ruby light. With cool and fragrant fingers, Twilight pale Drew o'er the extensive lawn her gradual veil, While Allan, in the long still gallery stole A calm delicious to the flutter'd soul; A sweet repose elysian to allay The intenser feelings of too blest a day— And, as he caught from pictur'd eyes the glance, Met the rais'd truncheon, or the kindling lance, And saw the glistening of a golden ray Soft o'er the portrait of the castle stray; From a kind power he heard, or seem'd to hear These grateful accents whisper'd in his ear: “Ere yet thy soul dissolve in amorous fires, “Attend, fair offspring of time-honour'd sires! “Long with fond care thy conflicts have I view'd, “Where rude plebeians scoff'd at generous blood. “Oft have I bade thee, like a cuirass, brace “Thy virtue, to contend with Pleasure's race, “And to the luxuries that around thee clos'd, “The sterner manners of thy house oppos'd! “'Twas I that urg'd, to wake thy slumbering flame “Chivalric, down the glen the falcon's aim! “'Twas I, that, as thy dubious steps advanc'd, “O'er the grey fane a sudden sunbeam lanc'd. “'Twas I, while demons urg'd their circling flight, “That brought the fleeting posey to thy sight. “'Twas I that suffer'd necromantic forms “To try thy powers in fogs, and fires, and storms; “When the dark fiends, still aiding all I schem'd, “Misled thy footsteps as they vainly deem'd, “Hurl'd o'er thy head the surge with fearful shock, “And barr'd thine egress from the haunted rock. “And, lo! thy virtues, nerv'd amidst the fight “With double strength, and drest in lovelier light, “Tho' oft the lurking demon dealt the blow, “Have triumph'd over each insidious foe “Thus thine own oak, to earth by tempests bow'd, “Elastic springs, nor heeds the threatening cloud— “Thus, tho' awhile by rushing rains deprest, “Lifts to the expanding skies a greener crest. “Lo, while thy neighbours, lur'd by Fashion's glare, “Scatter their patrimonial wealth in air, “Then curse the suppleness that pleas'd the great, “And hollow friendships mourn, unmask'd too late; “Be thine to rear again, auspicious youth, “And lighten with the smiles of cordial truth “Andarton's stately fabric, as portray'd “On yonder tablet, ere the model fade; “Borne from the monkish walls that Tamar crown, “There fix each holy relic of renown; “Nor scorn the sabre's venerable grace “That in thine armoury claims the central place. “So, while the patriarch arms again shall meet “Thine helmet erst to boyish pastime sweet, “That abbey crumbling by the Tamar's side, “And old Tintadgel's monumental pride “Shall, each, the deep regard of ages claim, “In ruin sacred to the Andarton-name. “Go then, by wealth, but more by Emma blest, “Go hail thy bride, caressing and carest! “I mark'd the hour, when Pity's touch betray'd “Thy heart unconscious to the cottage-maid! “I mark'd, tho' long thy bosom was deceiv'd, “The first warm sighs thy infant passion heav'd! “I mark'd thee first suspicious of her power, “Asham'd and cursing that inglorious hour! “I saw thee from thy vulgar fetters break, “And visit Juliet, still for Emma's sake! “I saw thee, lull'd in love's delicious dream, “On Emma doat, tho' Juliet was the theme; “And long I welcom'd Emma, thine alone, “Thy sole possessor to thyself unknown! “And, as thy fancy would, unask'd, compare “The form, the virtues of the rival fair; “'Twas I display'd, before thy partial eyes, “Thy Emma, drest in more attractive dyes. “To fan thy love for Emma to a blaze, “I shew'd thee Juliet's light capricious ways. “But, as thy candour saw her freakish youth “Erring, yet still reclaim'd to love and truth, “And tho' it waver'd oft, the needle view'd “With all its inbred qualities endued; “I shew'd the secret that possess'd her soul, “The unvarying needle, and its proper pole. “Hail happy Pair! May wealth, by merit won, “Grace your calm bowers, and glide from Sire to Son! “And, whilst thy conduct meets applause, “May Allan! stedfast in the glorious cause “Of ancient faith, and eager to oppose “The modish arts of innovating foes;— “O may thy pattern of distinguish'd worth “Restore to kind regard the claims of birth; “Till Public Virtue from oblivion raise “The hereditary fane of former days!” END OF SECOND VOLUME.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">VOL. III. LYRIC PIECES. ODE; SUNG BY THE GREEK GIRL IN THEOCRITUS; IDYLL. XV. Sweet smiling Arbitress of Love, Queen of the soft Idalian grove; Whom Golgos and the Erycian height, And thy fair fanes of gold delight— How lov'd the down-shod Hours have led Thy own Adonis from the dead, To all thy ardent wishes dear; Restor'd—to bless the closing year! Still, tho' they move on lagging wing, The Hours some balmy blessing bring! Hail, daughter of Dione, hail, Whose power from dark Avernus' vale Caught Berenice to the blest, And with ambrosia fill'd her breast! For thee, bright Goddess of the skies, To whom a thousand temples rise, The child of Berenice comes, Arsinoe; (Helen-like she blooms) With nature's luxuries to adorn Thy lov'd Adonis' festal morn! Lo! fruits, whate'er creation yields, Lo! the ripe produce of the fields And gardens, mingling many a dye, In silver baskets round him lie! See, richly cas'd in glowing gold, Yon' box of alabaster hold The sweets of Syrian groves; and stor'd With honey'd cakes, the luscious board! Observe, whatever skims the air, Or lives on earth, assembled there! And green shades, arch'd with anise, rise, Where many a little Cupid flies, Like the young nightingales that love, New-fledg'd, to flutter thro' the grove— Now perching, now with short essay Borne on weak wing from spray to spray! Of gold—of ebon what a store! And see two ivory eagles soar Severing the dark cloud where, above, They bear young Ganymede to Jove! Behold that tapestry diffuse The richness of the Tyrian hues! Ev'n they who tend Milesian sheep Would own, 'tis softer far than sleep! Amid this bed's relieving shade, Mark rosy-arm'd Adonis laid! And from that couch survey the bride Bend o'er his cheek with blushes dy'd, His chin's soft down; as fond to sip New rapture from the ruby lip! Now let her joy—But ere the morn Shall dry the dews that gem the thorn, His image to the shore we'll bear, With robes unzon'd, and flowing hair— With bosoms open'd to the day; And warble thus the choral lay: ‘Thou—thou alone, dear youth, 'tis said, ‘Canst leave the mansions of the dead; ‘And, passing oft the dreary bourne, ‘Duly to earth's green seats return! ‘Such favour not the Atridæ knew, ‘Nor who the fleecy flocks o'erthrew! ‘Nor Hector, his fond mother's joy; ‘Nor Pyrrhus, proud of plunder'd Troy! ‘Nor ev'n Patroclus great and good; ‘Nor they who boast Deucalion's blood; ‘Nor Pelops' sons; nor, first in fame, ‘The high Pelasgians blazon'd name.’ Propitious, O Adonis, hear; Thus bring delight each future year! Kind to our vows Adonis prove, And greet us with returning love! ODE TO THE CICADA. I. Cicada lov'd, whose little limbs are spread On yonder soft luxuriant bed; Who hopp'st the lawns along, Chaunting an idle song: Whether, amid full-blown flowers, Blythe thou sipp'st refreshing showers— Drunk with heaven's fragrant tears; Or where green waters glide, Thou lovest to reside In the moist grass of shady plains; Or modulating dulcet strains Thy emulative throat Outvies the shepherd's note, Whilst all the village round thy accents hears. II. Or when the sun darts down its scorching ray To vex the rustic's weary way; By a sweet murmuring rill, Thou gratest, shrieking shrill: Or if the deities of heaven Nectarian sweets to thee have giv'n With ministerial rains; And bounteously bestrew Thy bed with pearly dew— Assist my song; while skill'd in rhymes Thy poet thro' all future times To last, a temple rears; And thro' the listening spheres Still more and more thy fame immortal honour gains. MONA. I. “Shroud, in the billowy mist's deep bosom shroud “My ravag'd isle!”—the voice was vain— Mona! mark yon kindling cloud That seems to fire the main; As, flashing to the distant skies, Broad the hostile flames arise From the reverential wood; Red its central gloom with blood! Many a white-rob'd Druid hoar Totters in the stream of gore; Meets the faulchion's furious blow; Sinking, execrates the foe; Or, across the Cromlech's stone, Pours his dark mysterious moan; Or grasps his shrine, and hails the stroke, Stabb'd beneath the holy oak; Yelling, whilst the maniac-maid Hurries down the dimwood glade; And uproots her bristling hair, Paler amid the ghastly glare! II. But lo! the scenes of other days are fled! Yet mysterious horror fills The long-scoop'd dales, where Druids bled, And deepens the dark hills! Thro' the tufted rock that wide Opens its encavern'd side, Ivied ruins gleaming gray, Break the torrent's foamy way. There the Enthusiast loves to dwell, Low in the romantic dell; Tracing temples, abbey walls, Shiver'd arches, castle halls: Whether the sun dart his light Mid the branches, mossy white; Or the star of eve, aslant, Glimmer on the spectre-haunt; Oft as the moon-light echoes round Add their store of mellow sound, To the crash of tumbling heaps That o'erbrow'd the craggy steeps; To the murmurs of the cave, Fretted by many a restless wave! THE FAITHLESS COMALA. Where wanders the breeze from the mist-cover'd vale, With the reeds of blue Lora to play; To Comala young Connal would breathe the love-tale, And with sighs her soft glances repay. Her eyes with a beautiful azure were bright; Like the plume of the raven, her hair: And, loveliness beaming around her as light, Like the snow her full bosom was fair. His forehead with open sincerity glow'd: His eye, as an eagle's, was keen: His long yellow tresses with gracefulness flow'd; And majesty shone in his mien. But his clan was now rous'd by the tumult of arms, And he tremblingly bade her adieu; Tho' she swore that to him were devoted her charms, That her heart should be never untrue. “If a moment from truth I depart (she would cry) “If the love of my Connal I slight; “May I ride on the wings of the tempest, and fly “Till I plunge into fathomless night.” Yet scarce had he rush'd to the battle of spears, Ere Morlo the virgin address'd: Her brow was o'erclouded awhile; and her tears, Like the dew, trickled over her breast. Alas! the career of his wonderful deeds Each tongue was too prompt to proclaim: Of his chariot of war, and his thunder-clad steeds Too often re-echoed the fame. Perfidious, the maiden was pleas'd with his vows, And smil'd on his wishes to wed: And Morlo appointed the day when a spouse He should bear her in bliss to his bed. That day was at hand. The pale shadows were still: The moment of midnight was nigh; When in terror she listen'd to wheels on the hill, And the trampling of horses hard by— And a voice, as in fear: “Haste, my charmer, away! “Comala! my chariot ascend! “'Tis Morlo invites—and thy Morlo obey: “O'er the heath let us speedily bend. “Lo! Connal with vengeance approaches—e'en now “The clashing of armour I hear! “He comes with his warriors; and, death on his brow, “He brandishes wildly the spear.” She sprung to the seat; while aloft on the pole, And straight as an arrow he stood: And the chariot roll'd hoarse, as the waterfalls roll, When Winter descends in a flood. Like a frost o'er the heath the cold moon-beams were spread: The shaggy rocks glitter'd on high: And the three mossy stones that gleam over the dead, Caught, often, Comala! thine eye. And now at the foot of a mountain they came: The coursers paw wildly the ground, Then wind up the steep, like two volumes of flame, To their hoofs as the caverns resound. Save the din of their course, not a murmur was heard: And, as echoed the dingles below, Each oak in a pause of still horror appear'd, And motionless, gaz'd the fleet roe. On the top of the mountain scarce rattled the car, When off like a meteor it flew: And he said, as his steeds lightly gallop'd on air— “Now, Connal, 'tis vain to pursue!” “Ah whither, my Morlo! ah where are we borne?” (With a cold shriek of horror she cry'd) “Never fear! never fear! ere the glimpse of the morn “I shall hail thee my high-bosom'd bride.” Where they rush'd, the pale tower and the lake and the wood Swam in dizzy confusion beneath; Till the moon no more glimmer'd, descending in blood, To the blast that sang shrill on the heath. Wide over the foam of the ocean they flew, As a gleam from the north would disclose The waters that deep in a hollow withdrew, Or, roaring in surges, arose. Dark-red in the west now a fabric appear'd, Like cromlechs on cromlechs up-pil'd: At the sight, the steeds neigh'd, and then dreadfully rear'd, And snorted, with extasy wild. “Lo yonder (he shouted) my turrets arise; “The castle stupendously swells: “See lights thro' the windows illumine the skies— “Far within is the feast of the shells. “The bridemaids look out from the chambers: behold! “They beckon, as swift we advance! “And hark! the magnificent portals unfold: “Full soon shall we waken the dance.” “'Tis the House of the Thunder (she utter'd) O save— “See—see—thro' the breaches they dart! “O Morlo! look back!—and the lightnings I brave, “If Comala yet live in thy heart.” He look'd—It was Connal! “I fell, yester-morn, “In the sight! But thy bed I prepare!” Cried the Spectre, his eyes flashing vengeance and scorn; Then vanish'd, at once, with his car! Down—down, as to cling to the Thunder she tried, She dropp'd like an arrow of light: And, whirl'd thro' the tempest, the treacherous bride Was plung'd into fathomless night. HIGHLAND ODE. I Ere Arven vanish'd from my eyes, And left my widow'd soul to sighs, How sweet, where summer breezes blow, To trace the heath-flower's gradual glow, Hail the grey linnet's song, or mark Veil'd in a cloud, the mounting lark, Or wander, where the lucid rill Prattles beside the pine-crown'd hill, Or, deep within the forest, start Mid intertwisted boughs the hart, Or wake, with my old hunting-horn, The echoes of the merry morn, Then seek the hall, where plenty dwells, And share, at eve, the feast of shells! II But Arven's feet, with gentle print, Gave to the tender flower its tint: Soon as its matin song was heard My Arven plum'd the soaring bird: She bade the clear stream tinkling flow, Or with pleas'd eye pursu'd the doe: Her image only render'd dear The wildwood chace, the festal cheer! Alas! when, mild as morning-break, I view'd the blush steal o'er her cheek, When heav'd her snowy breast, more fair In contrast with her raven hair, She seem'd all nature to absorb In the pure brightness of her orb. III And once, when o'er the thistly waste Murmur'd the melancholy blast, When from the dark-red thunder broke The flame that rent the towering oak, When spectres clad in sable shrouds, Gleam'd from the chambers of the clouds; When slow, along the midnight heath, Mov'd the prophetic pomp of death; When helmets, hung in darksome rows, Shook, to the moon, their steely brows; 'Twas then I deem'd some danger near, And own'd my bosom chill'd with fear; For, as I saw her pallid hue, Her shuddering frame, I trembled too! IV Yet now the lightning's shaft may fly: And ghosts may beckon from on high. Tho' others quiver as the leaf; I fear not—I am full of grief! Tho' pale processions threaten fate, I dread not the funereal state! Others may shrink, in lonely halls, From casques that sigh along the walls; Unterrified I sit alone, Nor heed the lifted vizor's groan! 'Tis only at my Arven's tomb I see, how dark! the gather'd gloom: Yet, as I drink the charnel air, I weep, but cannot tremble there! EGYPTIAN ODE. Where pleasures too intensely glow, We oft observe the intruder Woe!— See tufted Faioum breathe delight From rose-trees kindling on the sight, From orange-blooms, pomegranate flowers Of scarlet, or soft tamarind bowers, And loftier palms, that wave, between, Their foliage of a deeper green, Relieving the bright azure skies Where scarce a rainy vapour flies; While thro' the fragrance as it blows A stream of liquid amber flows, While nestles many a gurgling dove In the deep bosom of the grove, And the plum'd ostrich on the sands, Or pelican majestic stands. To cool the sun's meridian beams, There fruits refreshing kiss the streams, Or blushing to eve's purple ray Amid the breezy verdure play— As its leaves shade each silver sluice The pulpy water-melon's juice, To eager thirst delicious balm; And sugary dates that crown the palm. Yet from the rocks that skirt the wood, Fell tigers bound, to thirst on blood; Yet the wide-water'd landscapes smile, Where lurks the treacherous crocodile; And, ere the melting fruit we grasp, Death-doom'd, we feel the envenom'd asp. Then hail my Albion's hoary coast, Where, tho' no scenes Elysium boast, We court not temperate joys in vain, Nor thrill'd by bliss, nor stung by pain. ODE WRITTEN AFTER A THUNDER-STORM. 1785. Red thro' a labouring cloud, that bore Against the winds its lurid store, Arose the lunar beam: The foliage lash'd the forest-steep, Then shrunk into a gloom more deep, And with a sullen murmur foam'd the troubled stream. O'er the dun skirtings of the dale, The brooding spirit of the gale In pitchy darkness hung; When on a lofty-crested oak, Sudden, the forked lightning broke, And down the rocky dell its shiver'd branches flung. Appall'd I saw the sulphur'd front Of heaven! Above my sylvan haunt I saw the tempest roll; Till Fancy lent her magic aid, Dispell'd the terrours of the shade, And wing'd to distant climes my desultory soul. “Fear not,” she cried, “the thunder's wreck, “Since Albion's guardian genii check “The demons of the storm: “Far other is the fever'd air, “That kindles with eternal war, “Where nature starts aghast at many a fiendlike form. “Lo! where, amidst Messene's towers, “That angel of perdition lours, “Pavilion'd in the gloom! “Mark—mark the dead portentous pause— “See, earth distends her flaming jaws; “And myriads sink ingulph'd in one disastrous tomb. “Fell as the grisly lion prowls, “Yon desolating whirlwind howls “O'er Afric's savage waste: “Save where the billowy horrors sail, “In sultry stillness sleeps the gale; “And, if the black air breathe, it breathes a poison'd blast. “And, as the fierce Arabian bands “Guide o'er immeasurable sands “The camel's fiery way; “Behold the raging Samiel rise, “Pass in pale pomp athwart the skies, “Shake his pestiferous wing, and rush to seize his prey. “His giant strides survey—his head “Half viewless in a cloud of red; “Ah! death was in that grasp!— “To earth they fall: in thunders hoarse “He riots o'er each shrivel'd corse, “Catches the expiring groan, and stores the envenom'd gasp. “Or turn thee, where the purest day “Unsoften'd in its torrid ray “Is all one glaring sky; “Where no cool evening spreads its shade; “No mellow tints of purple fade; “But, as the sun retires, the blazing meteors fly. “See in the livid heavens appear “Yon speck, that swells its dusky sphere, “And dims the boiling deep: “Still broader it expands its orb; “And bursting, as it would absorb “All earth, destruction speeds the dread tornado's sweep. “Ah! ruin wide as this extends “Full oft, where panting India bends “To drink the sacred stream, “And roaring to the host of heaven, “Views from their dens her panthers driv'n, “Whilst all her citron groves are wrapt in one wide flame. “And ruin, dire as this, hath spread “Where Montezuma's offspring bled “Beneath the ruffian blade; “Where, blackening over Andes' height, “The Condor wheels its monster flight, “And bids the enormous plume its iceclad mountain shade. “Yet here, tho' loud the tempest's roar, “From Piercefield's castle, to the shore “Where rough Tintadgel frowns, “Thy Albion's temperate skies shall smile, “And summer bless the genial isle, “While her green clustering hills the unblasted fruitage crowns. “Here, tho' the keener lightnings play, “'Tis but to give the unfolding day “A more salubrious breeze; “And, whirling sulphur to the skies, “Tho' Thules sink, and Thules rise, “Her firm-bas'd rocks shall stand, begirt with friendly seas!” ODE WRITTEN IN A PICTURE GALLERY. 1786. On the dun portrait, duskier in decay, Slept the silver orb of night; When in a fleecy cloud the broken light, Fainting fled. His tresses gray To the brightening moon he shook, And, with awaken'd wildness in his look That on deeds of battle mus'd, From his majestic brow a sabler shade effus'd. “Ah! where the worthies of old time, (he sigh'd) “Where the richly-pictur'd race “That fronted the long gallery's scutcheon'd grace? “Where the chief, whose mailed pride “Near yon pillar erst repos'd; “Whilst through the lifted beaver he disclos'd “The Crusader's ardent soul, “That bade the unhallow'd blood in one wide torrent roll. “What though in ermin'd dignity I view “Glanville's venerable mien? “Alas, with life's expression dimly seen, “Clay-cold is the pictur'd hue! “Pale his consort's gorgeous train: “Scarce glimmer the faint honours of her chain; “Tho' but erst the ponderous gold “Flung its resplendent light across each fluid fold. “What tho' where proud Godolphin crowns the plain “Turreted in antique gloom, “These hoary forms beneath the fretted dome “Rise, in sweeping robes, again? “There, unheeded too, they fade, “Ah! never by the gazing eye survey'd; “While their pensive shadows fall “In solitary state along the banner'd hall. “There once, when Chivalry's romantic flame “Fiercely burnt in warrior breasts, “The hospitable Baron hail'd his guests, “Steel-clad by his tissued dame! “Rich the goblet's golden gleam, “Their plum'd casques nodding o'er its spiced stream: “And, as many a deed was sung “Of valorous enterprize, the roofs high-raft'd rung. “There echoed to the minstrel-harp divine “Tales of battling swords that clash'd, “As all the tournament its glory flash'd “On the chiefs of Cornish line— “Tales of Kaliburn, that mow'd “A million down, where slaughtering Arthur strode; “Who, tho' strong by magic steel'd, “Fell a gigantic corse, and shook all Camlan's field! “There, in heroic song, the adventurous blade, “Storming the dim castle, broke “The wizard spell, and, at the massy stroke, “Rescued the long-prison'd maid! “There, impetuous, from the van “The red-cross knight along the ramparts ran; “And, distain'd with paynim gore, “From Salem's battlements the sacred trophies tore. “Such themes, familiar to Godolphin's walls, “Midst the Baron's festal cheer, “Fill'd, when the deeds of warlike worth were dear, “All Cornubia's castle-halls! “Buried with the mighty dead, “From human eye the bardic fires are fled: “Hers'd I saw Lanhydroc's lord! “There Chivalry last hail'd the high baronial board. “To prop yon desolated arch were vain, “Mouldering by the moated streams! “The unvaulted gate-way thro' its ivy gleams; “As athwart the Gothic fane “Yonder wildly-rifted yew, “That o'er the cloyster its broad branches threw, “Darksome in the days of yore, “The wreck of each rude storm still echoes in the roar. “Perish'd are all the triumphs of romance! “Yet, along the drear walls dank, “The dinted target's and riv'n corslet's clank “Tell of many a bloody lance; “Where, Restormal's rampires round, “To the rough fragment's mass the hills resound; “Where Dunheved, frowning deep, “Slopes its embattled towers with necromantic sweep.” He ceas'd: and kindling fearful to the view— Rapid as the lightning's ray, A spectre on the moon-beam glanc'd away! Sudden his blank visage grew Paler than the stiffen'd dead! (Each column shivering as the spectre fled) And, the shade of mortal mould, Dim was his feeble form, his sombre eye was cold. TO THE RIVER COLY. 1789. Ah! soothing stream, whose murmurs clear Meet, once again, my pensive ear, That wand'rest down thine osier'd vale, Where passion told her melting tale; Thy evening banks to memory sweet, I fondly trace, with pilgrim feet! Here, stealing thro' the willow shade That quiver'd o'er my charming maid, Full oft hath youthful ardour prest Trembling, the bloom on Laura's breast, While to the languish of her eyes That bosom heav'd and blush'd in sighs! Then every twinkling leaf above Seem'd conscious to the breath of love. Sudden, the pathway's easy flow Wav'd in a gentler curve below; Each flower assum'd a soften'd hue, And clos'd its cup in brighter dew! Tho' not the same these views appear, As when I rov'd a lover here; Tho' far from Laura's smile I stray, And slope my solitary way; Yet—yet, with no cold glance I see This winding path, that willow tree; Yet, musing o'er thy channel bend, And in each pebble find a friend; And eager catch, at every pace, Of former joys some fading trace— Some features of the past, that seem The faery painting of a dream! But ah! the twilight shadows fall; Dun evening hastes to darken all: A duskier verdure clothes the dale; The mossy branches glimmer pale: And, Coly! the fair scene is o'er, Thy lovelorn waters mark'd no more! ODE TO THE SPIRIT OF FRESHNESS; SKET CHEDON THE FIRST OF MAY 1790, AT MAMHEAD, NEAR AN EVERGREEN OAK. ? nigrum Ilicibus crebris sacra nemus accubet umbra. Virgil. O thou, the daughter of the vernal dew That, glistering to the morn with pearly light The gentle Aura woo'd Beside a dripping cave; There, midst the blush of roses, won the nymph To dalliance, as in sighs she whisper'd love; There saw thee born, as May Unclos'd her laughing eye; Spirit of Freshness, hail! At this dim hour While, streakt with recent grey, the dawn appears, Where sport thy humid steps, Ambrosial essence, say? Haply, thy slippers glance along my path Where frosty lilies veil their silver bells Beneath the lively green Of their full-shading leaves. Or dost thou wander in the hoary field Where, overhead, I view the cautious hare Nibbling, while stillness reigns, The barley's tender blade? Or dost thou hover o'er the hawthorn bloom, Where, in his nest of clay, the blackbird opes His golden lids, and tunes A soft, preluding strain? Or, art thou soaring thro' the fleeced air To meet the day-spring, where the plume-wet lark Pours, sudden, his shrill note Beneath a dusky cloud? I see thee not—But lo! a vapoury shape That oft belies thy form, emerging slow From that deep central gloom, Rests on the moontipt wood; Now, by a halo circled, sails along, As gleams with icicles his azure vest, Now shivers on the trees, And feebly sinks from sight. 'Tis cold! And lo, upon the whitening folds Of the dank mist that fills the hollow dell, Chill damp with drizzly locks Glides in his lurid car; Where a lone fane o'er those broad rushes nods In torpid slumber; save when flitting bats Stir the rank ivy brown That clasps its oozing walls! Yet, yet, descending from yon eastern tent, Whose amber seems to kiss the wavy plain, A form, half-viewless, spreads A flush purpureal round. I know thee, Freshness! Lo, delicious green Sprinkles thy path. The bursting buds above With vivid moisture glow, To mark thy gradual way. The florets, opening, from their young cups dart The carmine blush, the yellow lustre clear: And now entranc'd, I drink Thy breath in living balms! And not a ryegrass trembles, but it gives A scent salubrious: not a flower exhales Its odours, but it breathes O'er all, a cool repose. Mild shadowy power! whilst now thy tresses bath'd In primrose tints, the snowdrop's coldness shed On sky-blue hyacinths, Thy chaste and simple wreath; While flows to zephyr thy transparent robe Stealing the colours of the lunar bow, How short thy vestal reign Amid the rosy lawn! Yes! if thou mix the saffron hues that stream From the bright orient with the roscid rays Of yonder orb that hangs A silvery drop, on high; Or, if thou love, along the lucent sod, To catch the sparkles of thy modest star; With all the mingled beams Heightening some virgin's bloom; Fleet as the shadow from the breded heaven Brushing the gossamer, thy steps retire Within the gelid gloom Of thy green-vested oak. There, as its ambient arch with airy sweep Chequers the ground, thine “eyes of dewy light” Pursue the turf that floats In many a tremulous wave. And now, retreating to the breezy marge Of the pure stream, thy ruby fingers rear The new-blown flowers that wake To tinge its crystal tide: Or gently on thine alabaster urn Thy head reclines, beneath some aged beech That mid the crisped brook Steeps its long-wreathed roots; While from the cave where first thine essence sprung, Where the chaste naiads rang'd their glittering spars, Rills, trickling thro' the moss, Purl o'er the pebbled floor. There sleep till eve; as now the tyrant Heat Kindles, with rapid strides, the extensive lawn, And e'en thy favourite haunt, The verdurous oak, invades. And may no vapours from that osier'd bank Annoy thee—thou, whose delicacy dreads, Tho' shrinking from the sun, The sallow's stagnant shade. There sleep till eve; unless the spring-lov'd showers Pattering among the foliage, bid thee rise To taste those transient blooms That with the rainbow live. There sleep till eve; when, as thy parent Air With feathery softness flutters o'er thine urn, And midst the vermeil bower, The dew thy feet impearls; Joy'd shalt thou hail the watery-tinted cloud, Whose radiant skirts half-hide the westering orb, Whilst a fine emerald hue The whole horizon stains; Till thro' the fragrance of his sweet-briar leaves Thy glow-worm flings a solitary ray, As Peace descends, to hush The twilight-bosom'd scene! ODE ON THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF THE POETICAL MIND. 1791. 'Tis not for vulgar souls to feel Those sacred sympathies refin'd, That o'er the Poet's bosom steal, When nature, to his glowing mind, Each varied form, each colour gives, Where rich the bloom of beauty lives. For him yon smooth and shadowy green In contrast with the craggy steep, Hath charms, by common eyes unseen; As o'er the lawn with airy sweep That oak's extensive foliage flows, And to the summer-sunbeam glows. By fancy fir'd, his eye perceives New pleasure in the unsullied stream, That to the rose's vivid leaves Reflects a crimson-tinctur'd gleam; And wanders down the daisied vale, To the tall aspin twinkling pale. For him yon fawns in many a maze The splendour of the morning court; Or group'd, enjoy the genial blaze, As satiate of their frolic sport; And, with a charm confest by few, The setting glory still pursue. He sees some faery power illume The orient hills with richer light, Chasing the mist's disparted gloom: He sees, upon the mountain-height, Some faery power the pencil hold To paint the evening-cloud with gold. There, as the deep and stilly shade On night's pale bosom seems to rest, And, from the glimmering azure, fade The last cool tints that streak the west; He heaves—tho' others wonder why— He cherishes the pensive sigh. If, then, a livelier passion move The Poet's breast, to nature true; If in such scenes, with looks of love, He trace a more attractive hue; His heart what exstacy inspires, The female form when beauty fires! Light, as on air, her steps advance: Others may gaze with pleasur'd eye— He casts a more enamour'd glance; He breathes a more delicious sigh! Others may hail the enchanting sight— He faints with tremulous delight! That graceful negligence of mien; And, mantling as emotions rise, The blush of languishing sixteen To win the soul by sweet surprize; Those tresses, which luxuriant rove To kiss the heaving bloom of love— And melting o'er the accordant keys Touch'd by her rosy fingers fleet, Those tones, which, as the dying breeze, Mix with a voice divinely sweet— Others unwonted ardours boast; But, O Letitia, he is lost! Nor less his Taste and Genius prize The gay Honoria's artless youth; Oft as her more effulgent eyes, Beaming intelligence and truth, And, kindling quick with fancy, dart The expression of the untroubled heart— Ere with a spirit unreprest Her easy converse steal the hours, Where shines, in blessing others blest, A soul unconscious of its powers; Ere warbled yet a woodnote wild Proclaim her, Nature's favourite child. And, if a Mary's glance so meek, So gentle—so retir'd an air, Her native loveliness bespeak; While, as the radiance of the star That softly gilds the evening-dew, Her's is a trembling lustre too; O, if her heart such feelings breathe, So tender as her blushes tell, His hand shall weave a modest wreath To suit her timid sweetness well; And ever to her worth awake, Shall guard it for his Mary's sake. Such are the forms he values most: Waves the rich foliage o'er the lawn; The dales their roseate treasures boast; In sunny mazes sports the fawn; The rills their liquid amber pour— Still, still he fondly fancies more. “Come, Mary! grace the Poet's shade; “O come, to harmonize the whole!” Yet, if he meet the melting maid, Her beauty fills his ravish'd soul! The lawn, the vale, new charms may own— The charms he sees in her alone! THE GENIUS OF DANMONIUM. 1794. Where restless Teign, with many a surge Foams to his sacred Logan's height, The rockstone, at the wood's dark verge, Shook to the moon, array'd in light; When, as a cloud far off, disparting, flew, A shadowy form appear'd, majestic to my view. “Child of the dust”—the Genius cried— “To thee (no trivial boast) 'tis giv'n “To hear with emulative pride, “How Concord links the inspir'd of Heaven “Not with the Muse's silken ties alone, “But in that harmony which Friendship deems her own. “'Twas Concord bade the Bards of old “To Inspiration's numbers string “Their sweet-ton'd harps of burnisht gold “By sunny mount, or mossy spring— “Bade them, where Echo loves the sylvan dell, “The Druid's mystic pomp, the Hero's prowess tell. “The soul-subduing strain was high! “Still, still it vibrates in mine ear! “I catch the holy minstrelsy “To Devon's faery vallies dear— “Tho' central oaks no more, in forest deep, “Around the grey-stone cirque their twilight umbrage sweep. “Snatcht from the altars of the East “I see the fires of Danmon rise! “To mark the new-moon's solemn feast, “Behold, they lighten to the skies; “And, as assembled clans in silence gaze, “The distant Karnes draw near, and kindle to the blaze! “Fast by yon chasmed hill that frowns “Cleft by an elemental shock, “As ashen foliage light embrowns “Its rude side ribb'd with massy rock; “Lo, on the pillar'd way the white-robe'd bands “In long procession move, where proud the Cromlech stands. “But see, where breaking thro' the gloom, “Danmonium's warriour-genius speeds “That scythed car, the dread of Rome! “See, fiercer than the lightning, steeds “Trampling the dead, their hoofs with carnage stain, “Rush thro' the spear-strown field, and snort o'er heaps of slain. “Such was the heart-inspiring theme “Of Bards who sung each recent deed; “Whether amid the mailed gleam “Of war, they saw the hero bleed; “Or whether, in the Druid's circling fane, “They hymn'd to dreadful rites, the deep mysterious strain. “No more to boast a spotless green, “Erelong their garlands deck'd the dead; “As, fading from the sight, the scene “Of oriental glory fled! “Then written verse for oral numbers came, “And lays of little worth were consecrate to fame. “Then Saxon Poets swept their lyres, “But harsh was their untutor'd song: “Then Norman minstrels vaunted fires “That ill to Phœbus' train belong; “Not that the Bard of Isca's elder'd vale “Told to the sparkling stream an inharmonious tale. “And still, along the waste of years “Devonia mark'd some scatter'd rhymes; “But oft, her eyes suffus'd with tears, “Wistful, she look'd to ancient times— “Ah! few, monastic Tavy's banks beside, “Few were the Brownes that trac'd the silver-winding tide. “And tho' of fancy and of taste “A Rowe, the first-begotten child, “By dark romantic woods embrac'd, “Warbled his native carols wild; “'Twas from the lonely copse that high o'erhung “The Tamar's haunted wave, his ditty sweet he sung! “Tho' Gay attun'd his Dorian oat, “Such as beseems a simple swain; “He only pip'd a rustic note “To cheer the solitary plain— “Where, since the Bards of old, hath social love “Assenting Genius woo'd, to grace the Muse's grove? “Where, as in Danmon's myrtle bowers “The race of Iran caught the flame, “Exerting their congenial powers, “Not envious of a rival's name; “Where now, in close fraternal union meet “Spirits that court the Muse by friendship doubly sweet? “E'n now they live! E'en here they hail “Their reddening cliffs, in strains sublime; “Embosom'd in the vermeil dale, “Nurst by the rosy-breathing clime! “Here many a letter'd minstrel, more refin'd “Than Bards of other times, displays the ingenuous mind. “Behold, where lingering Isca laves “The turrets on her sloping banks, “While, far reflected by the waves “Rise her rich elms in tufted ranks, “The wreaths of Genius and of Taste adorn “Those whom with partial smile I greet in Devon born. “What tho' the Bards shall harp no more “To wondering ears their magic lays; “Yet shall my chosen tribe restore “The long-lost fame of other days— “Rapt with diviner energies, aspire “E'en to empyreal worlds, and catch the seraph's fire!” He ceas'd: and to the faultering sound The Spirit of the rock replied: The old oaks bending kiss'd the ground Then wav'd their boughs with conscious pride; While, borne on his translucent shell, hoar Teign Joy'd that two sons were his, to rival Isca's reign. TO A GENTLEMAN AND HIS FAMILY ON THEIR DEPARTURE FROM THEIR COUNTRY-HOUSE IN SEPTEMBER 1800. While, joyous 'mid the vernal blooms, My warblers sleek their golden plumes And chaunt their woodnotes clear; I bid them, thro' my laurel sprays, Still glance their hues, and pour their lays, Nor heed the passing year. But, transient as the blush of Spring, Far, far away, each vagrant wing Betrays the unpitying breast: And, as its gleam my heart deceives, I mark, among the shivering leaves, A solitary nest. Ye too, while summer-suns are gay, My every ardent with repay With social converse kind: But, when the winds blow cold and drear, Leave, as ye sudden disappear, A lonely roof behind. Yet shall my warblers, blithe again, Burnish the plume, and trill the strain, As wintry tempests cease: And, shall your smiles new lustre grant To those chill walls? Again, the Aunt Restore ? her charming Niece? HEROIC PIECES. HIERO. FROM THEOCRITUS: IDYLL. XVI. The Sons of Virtue mark with high regard The Muse's laurel'd priest—the holy bard; Left in the grave their unsung glory fade, And their cold moan pierce Acheron's dreary shade. What tho' Aleua's and the Syrian's domes Saw crouding menials fill their festal rooms; What tho' o'er Scopas' fields rich plenty flow'd, And herds innumerous thro' his vallies low'd; What tho' the bountiful Creondæ drove Full many a beauteous flock, thro' many a grove; Yet when expiring life could charm no more, And their sad spirits sought the Stygian shore; Their grandeur vanish'd with their vital breath, And riches could not follow them, in death! Lo these, for many a rolling age, had lain In blank oblivion, with the vulgar train, Had not their Bard, the mighty Ceian, strung His many-chorded harp, and sweetly sung In various tones, each high-resounded name, And giv'n to long posterity their fame! Verse can alone the steed with glory grace, Whose wreaths announce the triumph of the race! Could Lycia's chiefs, or Cycnus' changing hues, Or Ilion live, with no recording Muse? Not ev'n Ulysses, who thro' dangers ran For ten long years, in all the haunts of man; Who ev'n descended to the depths of hell, And fled, unmangled, from the Cyclops' cell— Not he had liv'd, but sunk, Oblivion's prey, Had no kind Poet stream'd the unfading ray! Thus too Philoetius had in silence past, And nameless old Laertes breath'd his last; And good Eumæus fed his herds in vain, But for Ionia's life-inspiring strain. For me, who now pursue the paths of fame, Rough are these paths, and dim the Muse's flame; Unless a patron's kind regard inspire, And Jove's auspicious omens fan the fire. The unwearied sun still rolls from year to year: Still shall proud victors in the race appear! Great as the stern Pelides' self, erelong A man shall shine, the subject of my song; Or in the might of towering Ajax rise, Who fought on Simois' plain, where Ilus lies. Ev'n now where Libya views the westering day, Phœnician armies shrink in pale dismay! Ev'n now, the Syracusians take the field, Couch the strong spear, and bend the sallow shield; While, as the chiefs by hymning poets blest, Great Hiero comes, and nods the horse-hair crest! Hear, O Minerva, and paternal Jove, And ye, who honour with your guardian love The walls of wealthy Syracuse, that throw Their awful shadows on the lake below— Hear! and may destiny o'erwhelming sweep Our foes away, far distant thro' the deep!— Far from this isle, a scatter'd few, to tell Widows and orphan sons, what myriads fell! CASTOR AND POLLUX. FROM THEOCRITUS: IDYLL. XXII. Leda's and Jove's great sons my verse inspire— The sons of Jove, their ægis-bearing sire! Castor;—and Pollux dreadful in the lists, The cestus brac'd with thongs around his wrists! My frequent song shall hymn your manly grace, Ye twins, the glory of the Spartan race! Powers, who protect us from the foe, and shield Our scar'd steeds trampling on the carnag'd field! Powers that o'erlook the struggling ship, and save, When stars arise malignant o'er the wave! Behold the loosen'd tempests swell the tide, Lash the high helm, and bulge each bursting side, And pour into the poop the mountain-surge; While the rent vessel reels upon the verge Of fate—its torn sails hanging in the blast, And wildly dasht around each shatter'd mast! Clouds big with hail the midnight heavens deform, And the broad ocean thunders to the storm! But ye, tho' now the closing waves pursue, From the chasm rescue the despairing crew! Lo! the clouds break! their scatter'd fragments fly, Whilst the drear winds in whispering murmurs die; And each mild star that marks the tranquil night Gilds the reposing wave with friendly light. Midst shores, that threaten'd, as in act to close Their adverse rocks, and Pontus drear with snows, When Argo pass'd, (her freight the sons of gods) And safely reach'd Bebrycia's wild abodes; Strait down the vessel's sides the chiefs descend, And o'er the shelter'd beach their footsteps bend; Place on the kindling fires the vase; and spread Soft on a shaded spot, their leafy bed. The Royal Brothers, eager to explore The sylvan scenes, far wander'd from the shore; O'er a fair mountain's woodland summits stray'd, The varied beauties of its brow survey'd; And, tracing the recesses of the mount, Found, deep-retir'd, a cool perennial fount. Brimful beneath a craggy rock it gleam'd; Whilst, at the bottom of the woodland beam'd Full many a scatter'd pebble to the light, As crystal or as polisht silver bright. Beside this spot, the plane-tree quivering play'd, And pensive poplars wav'd a paler shade; While many a fir in living verdure grew, And the deep cypress darken'd on the view: And there each flower that marks the balmy close Of Spring, the little bee's ambrosia, blows! Hard by (his couch the rock) a chieftain frown'd, His ears fresh reeking from the gauntlet's wound. Dire was his giant form; and amply spher'd The broad projection of his breasts appear'd: Like some Colossus wrought too firm to feel, His back all sinewy seem'd of solid steel. On his strong brawny arms his muscles stood, Like rocks, that, rounded by the torrent flood, Thro' the clear wave their shelving ridges show, One smooth and polisht prominence below. Rough round his loins a lion's spoils were flung: Suspended by the paws the trophy hung. HERCULES. FROM THEOCRITUS: IDYLL. XXV. And now, as broad enough for two The social path, inviting converse, grew, He walk'd attentive by the hero's side, Who thus, to gratify his wish, replied: ‘The Argive's story you recount, is true; ‘And hence, great Prince, the just surmise you drew: ‘Since then you ask, enamour'd of my fame, ‘How bled the furious beast, and whence he came; ‘My tongue shall tell you, in authentic strain, ‘What other Argives might attempt in vain. ‘Sent by some god, 'tis said, the monster flew ‘In vengeance, 'mid the base Phoronean crew, ‘For sacrifice unpaid; and rush'd amain, ‘One flood of carnage, thro' Pisæum's plain; ‘And o'er the Bembinœan glades, more fell, ‘Bade all the deluge of his fury swell! ‘Euristheus first enjoin'd me to engage ‘This beast, but wish'd me slain beneath his rage. ‘Arm'd with my bow, my quiver'd shafts, I went, ‘And grasp'd my club, on bold defiance bent— ‘My knotted club, of strong wild olive made, ‘That, rugged, its unpolisht rind display'd; ‘That with a wrench from Helicon I tore, ‘Its roots and all, and thence the trophy bore. ‘Soon as I reach'd the wood, I bent my bow, ‘Firm-strung its painted curve, and couching low, ‘Notch'd on the nerve, its arrow—look'd around, ‘And from my covert trac'd the forest-ground. ‘'Twas now high noon. No roar I heard, nor saw ‘One print that might betray the prowler's paw; ‘Nor rustic found, amidst his pastoral care, ‘Nor herdsman, who might shew the lion's lair. ‘Nor herds nor herdsmen venture to the plain; ‘All, fix'd by terror, in their stalls remain. ‘At length, as up the mountain-groves I go, ‘Amidst a thicket, I espy my foe: ‘Ere evening, gorg'd with carnage and with blood, ‘He sought his den deep-buried in the wood. ‘Slaughter's black dyes—his face—his chest distain, ‘And hang, still blacker, from his clotted mane; ‘While shooting out his tongue with foam besmear'd, ‘He licks the grisly gore that steep'd his beard. ‘Midst bowering shrubs I hid me from his view, ‘Then aim'd an arrow, as he nearer drew, ‘But from his flank the shaft rebounding flew. ‘His fiery eyes he lifted from the ground, ‘High rais'd his tawny head, and gaz'd around, ‘And gnash'd his teeth tremendous—when again, ‘(Vex'd that the first had spent its force in vain) ‘I launch'd an arrow at the monster's heart; ‘It flew—but left unpierc'd the vital part: ‘His shaggy hide repulsive of the blow, ‘The feather'd vengeance hiss'd, and fell below. ‘My bow, once more with vehemence I tried— ‘Then first he saw—and rising in the pride ‘Of lordly anger, to the fight impell'd, ‘Scour'd with his lashing tail his sides, and swell'd ‘His brindled neck, and bent into a bow ‘His back, in act to bound upon his foe! ‘As when a wheeler his tough fig-tree bends, ‘And flexile to a wheel each felly tends, ‘Thro' gradual heat—awhile the timber stands ‘In curves, then springs elastic from his hands; ‘Thus the fell beast, high bounding from afar, Sprung, with a sudden impulse, to the war. My left hand held my darts, and round my breast ‘Spread, thickly-wrought, my strong protecting vest. ‘My olive club I wielded in my right; ‘And his shagg'd temples struck, with all my might: ‘The olive snapp'd asunder on his head— ‘Trembling he reel'd—the savage fierceness fled ‘From his dimm'd eyes; and all contus'd his brain ‘Seem'd swimming in an agony of pain. ‘This—this I mark'd; and ere the beast respir'd, ‘Flung down my painted bow; with triumph fir'd, ‘Seiz'd instant his broad neck; behind him prest, ‘From his fell claws unsheath'd to guard my breast; ‘And twin'd, quick-mounting on his horrid back, ‘My legs in his, to guard from an attack ‘My griping thighs—then heav'd him (as the breath ‘Lost its last struggles in the gasp of death) ‘Aloft in air; and hail'd the savage dead! ‘Hell yawn'd—to hell his monster-spirit fled! ‘The conquest o'er, awhile I vainly tried ‘To strip with stone and steel the shaggy hide: ‘Some god inspir'd me, in the serious pause ‘Of thought, and pointed to the lion's claws. ‘With these full soon the prostrate beast I slay'd, ‘And in the shielding spoils my limbs array'd. ‘Thus drench'd with flocks and herds and shepherds' blood ‘Expir'd the monster of the Nemean wood.’ COMIC AND MOCK-HEROIC PIECES.

Scene, Praxinoe's House, in the Suburbs of Alexandria. GORGO, PRAXINOE, EUNOE. GORGO. My dear little girl, is Praxinoe at home? EUNOE. She is—but how late, Mrs. Gorgo, you come! PRAXINOE. Indeed! I thought, madam her head would ne'er push in— But, Eunoe, see for a chair and a cushion. EUNOE. I have— PRAXINOE. Pray sit down— GORGO. What a terrible din! What a pother! 'tis well I escap'd in whole skin! What a brave heart have I! to pass so many folks That clatter'd in sandals, and jostled in cloaks! And coaches—you cannot imagine the throng! I'm quite out of breath—and the way is so long! PRAXINOE. Too true: 'tis the fault of my plaguy old soul! And here must we live, and put up with a hole. What a desart! To vex me he tries all he can; He was ever a strange unaccountable man! He knew I could almost have died for the loss Of your chat—but my schemes 'tis his pleasure to cross. GORGO. [Pointing to the child.] Hush, madam—observe him—how earnest his eye— Don't talk of your husband, when Zopy is by. PRAXINOE. I don't mean your papa, my sweet little jewel! GORGO. But he understands—no—papa's not so cruel. PRAXINOE. This fellow then (we may disguise it, you know, And talk of the thing as if some time ago) This block of a fellow once happen'd to stop, To buy me some nitre and paint at a shop; When, for nitre, he purchas'd bay-salt; and, for rouge, The long-lubber gawky bought yellow gambouge. GORGO. Lord! mine is as bad! you could hardly have thought, For five fleeces like dogs-hair, and dear in a groat, That he squander'd away seven drachms! the sweet honey! Well might it be said, he was fleec'd of his money! But come, take your cloak—to Adonis we haste— And fasten your robe with its clasps to your waist; Our queen is preparing a sight so divine— PRAXINOE. Aye—all things, besure, with fine people are fine! But describe to me these preparations, so novel To me, who am coop'd in this lone little hovel. GORGO. 'Tis high time to go; and we'll talk at our leisure. PRAXINOE. Bring water: come quickly, you slut! What a pleasure These cats must enjoy on the down of a bed! Go, drive them away: but, you statue of lead, First bring me the water: See—see how you fill! Enough!—And how dare you so carelessly spill Such a flood on my gown? Well, I'm wash'd—God be blest! Here, hussey—and give me the key of my chest. GORGO. Your robe—let me see—I protest, 'tis not clumsy: Pray what did it cost? Nay, it vastly becomes ye. PRAXINOE. Don't ask me—it cost two good pounds and a crown; And my life I'd near into the bargain laid down. GORGO. No waste of your time or your money, however. PRAXINOE. True, Gorgo: Come bring me my scarf, and be clever In putting it on—and see there my umbrella. But as for my Zopy, the dear little fellow— You cannot go with us; the horses will bite; You may cry—but the goblin will come in the night: Cry on, if you please, sir; you shall not get hurt— Yet, girl, pray endeavour the child to divert! Bolt the door; but first call in the house-dog to watch; And see you don't lift, while I'm absent, the latch. [Exeunt. ACT THE SECOND. Scene, the Street at Alexandria. PRAXINOE, GORGO, OLD WOMAN, MAN, &amp;c. PRAXINOE. Good Heav'ns! what a tide! how or when shall we stem it? The street is as full as the bank of an emmet! O Ptolemy, great are the deeds thou hast done, Since thy father hath left, for Olympus, the throne! A thief or a robber how seldom we meet; Tho' pickpockets formerly crouded the street! —Heavens! what shall we do? The war-horses advance. Friend! do not ride over me! See how they prance! That terrible bay how he rears! let's be gone— Come, Eunoe—the rider, I'm sure, will be thrown. Thank Heaven that my boy is at home—let us haste— GORGO. Cheer up, dear Praxinoe—the danger is past. PRAXINOE. Well—now I begin to recover my fright— From a child I've been ready to faint at the sight Of an horse or an adder—But let's keep our ground— The mob from all quarters is thronging around. Enter old woman. GORGO. From the hall, mother? OLD WOMAN. Yes. GORGO. Can we press, thro' the swarm, in? OLD WOMAN. That's a point which the trial can only determine. He only, my daughter, who tries, can enjoy— By trying, the Greeks became masters of Troy. [Exit. GORGO. The crone! what a learned, oracular exit! Sure women have knowlege—but love to perplex it! So high is their soaring sagacity carried— They can tell you, how Jove to his Juno was married. Praxinoe! see what a croud at the gate! PRAXINOE. Immense! but 'tis troublesome, Gorgo, to wait! Come, give me your hand! and thou, Eunoe, stick (Take care not to lose her) to Madam Eutyck! Let us enter together! Good God! what a gap! My spring-silk has met with a horrid mishap! And my scarf in a moment—Oh! oh! Sir—forbear— And may Jupiter bless you— MAN. Dear madam, my care Be assur'd— PRAXINOE. How they thrust! I am sure I am hurt! MAN. Good madam! cheer up, we are riding in port! PRAXINOE. And there may you ride, sir, this year and the next— Still Eunoe's terribly jostled and vext! Struggle stoutly, my girl!—Very well! as he cried— “We're all in!”—when he lock'd himself up with his bride. [Scene closes. ACT THE THIRD. Scene, the Hall of the Palace. GORGO, PRAXINOE, STRANGER, GREEK SINGING-GIRL. GORGO. Praxinoe! see the rich-tapestried room! How exquisite! sure it was wrought in the loom Of the gods! PRAXINOE. And how striking! how bold the designs! No pencil could draw such elaborate lines! Minerva! they rise above critical strictures! For what animation enlightens the pictures! Man's indeed a wise animal! See how they move— Nay, start from the hangings: they cannot be wove! But look on yon' figure: how charming he lies! All silver the couch, and so vivid the dyes Of his young downy beard—'tis not hard to discover The features of Venus's beautiful lover. STRANGER. Cease—cease—idle dames, your impertinent tattle! As hoarse and as broad as the pigeons ye prattle. GORGO. Indeed! who are you? Tho' we talk, shall you curb us? Seek those who will listen, nor dare to disturb us! Dost think Syracusians will tamely knock under, That can trace to the city of Corinth their founder? No, Master Officious! 'Tis seldom you hear of one A slave, that's descended from mighty Bellerophon. And as to our tongue, you've no reason to teaze us: 'Tis our own mother language of Peloponnesus. PRAXINOE. We have husbands, beside, that will bluster and cuff! One tyrant, besure, is in conscience enough. GORGO. Hush—hush—my dear life! She's preparing the song: The sweet little Grecian! How still is the throng! She'll excel pensive Sperchis! See—see her prepare With a languish so soft—so delicious an air! So meltingly plaintive her musical tone is— But hark!—She's beginning the death of Adonis. How sweetly she sings! Lord! how much she must know! Happy minstrel! But bless me, 'tis high time to go. Should my husband return before dinner is ready, With his blustering vagaries my head would be giddy. Adieu, then, at present, my sweetest Adonis! And again may you meet such a crowd of your cronies! THE VISION OF SIR AARON. His coming was with lying wonders. St. Paul. His vision, a diabolical delusion. Lavington. Festa infesta Deo, Divumque sacerrima sacra. The full moon rising, shed a sanguine ray; Whilst Aaron hurried to the cobler's cell: And sudden, by the spirit borne away, Both, with alacrity no tongue can tell, Setting their honest faces towards Hell, Began to give their families the slip: Nathless, as if recovering from a spell, “What! no provision, sir, for such a trip,” Said Drywit, “not a drop, to wet the parched lip?” He, deaf and mute, to where at distance seen, A glimmering rock reliev'd the sullen waste, Swallow'd the ground, till roll'd a mist between, And every feature of the crag effac'd. “Homeward, (cried Drywit) master, let us haste, “Nor wander here, while glooms around us close!” When Aaron, full of joy, his clerk embrac'd— “No! they are devils, my friend, that interpose, “And victors shall we rise o'er all our ghostly foes.” Certes, no sooner had Sir Aaron said, Than, far off, a dim radiance met the view, That now appear'd an orb of vivid red, Now trembled, dying to a paly blue. And, “See,” said Aaron, “to the saints so true, “Already hath the spirit vouchsaf'd its light. “What tho' still rage the dire obstructing crew; “That splendour on the trees shall guide aright “Our steps, and strait for Heaven provoke the glorious fight.” The whistling of rude boughs assails his ear; And, kindling from above the ruddy copse, The heavenly lustre seems to shine more clear: Away, with a triumphant air he hops, Nor by the spirit urg'd, a moment stops, Till to a quagmire giving way, so civil, He bows, and makes obeisance with his chops! “Zounds! (says the cobler) evil follows evil: “We have, indeed, commenc'd a journey to the devil!” Arising from the embraces of the fen, “Come, Drywit, never fear!” the hero cries: “Drywit rejoice! I see the hollow glen— “'Tis there the treasure of the spirit lies!” When, as at once his fancy seiz'd the prize, Down went the antagonist of death and sin; Tho' swore the varlet, with uplifted eyes, His service never more should Aaron win, If he could once get home, escaping in whole skin. Deep in the glenwood, nigh a sombrous cave, He saw, and told his transports in a bound, Its snowy leaves the Leucophyllon wave, And wrench'd it, by the roots, from out the ground; When, as it quiver'd, with a mighty sound The cavern to his sense expanded wide; And many a dog-star flam'd the vault around: And at his feet there foam'd a sulph'rous tide; And far within, in troops, dun shadows seem'd to glide. Strait where he stalk'd, arose the unceasing cries Of infants, who, by too severe a doom, Ere yet they could enjoy these upper skies, Were hurried, all untimely, to the tomb. Lorn innocents! no sooner from the womb Ye struggled into life, than, unappriz'd Of sin, ye sunk into the oblivious gloom! Ah, why, when sinners grey are canoniz'd, Why weep so sore?—ye died, poor wretches, unbaptiz'd! There, too, innumerous shapes, in sable clad, Curates and parish priests, would flit along; There silken deans would rustle thro' the shade, And lawn-sleeves gleam, the cassock'd tribe among! Ah! what avail'd the vicar's sober tongue That to a blameless life the meed assign'd? What, the pure precepts that o'eraw'd the throng, Where prelates, destin'd to adorn mankind, To courtly splendour join'd an apostolic mind? At Aaron's nod the yellow waves flew back, Whilst on the fronting bank, two shapes appear'd Dire-menacing: the one as midnight black, A form, half-billow, and half-flame, up-rear'd, And shook a dreadful dart with blood besmear'd! The other roll'd, tho' woman to the waist, As horrid yelpings from her womb were heard, A scaly tail voluminous! Aghast, Yet both in silence stood, as, calm, Heaven's champion pass'd. First, to his sight, a choir of boys and girls Were whirl'd about in one perpetual dance, Swift as her restless wheel the spinster whirls; While from their hollow eyes they look'd askance With loose desires, and pin'd at every glance: Nor could the votaries of religious whim One step beyond the circling line advance; As still St. Vitus, round a caldron's brim, Urg'd his fantastic imps convuls'd in every limb. Next, in a chair of pearl, beneath a roof Of gold, a female methodist embrac'd A puny petit-maitre, whilst aloof The fashions of the world each other chac'd. Charm'd with the visions of caprice or taste, The fair one from her eye new rapture glanc'd; And, tho' in life a devotee strait-lac'd, Yet “in her heart a rake,” now gaily danc'd To pleasure, now more calm, appear'd as one entranc'd. He, in himself absorb'd, his brilliant rings Runs over, or his pink-rosettes that glow On each sharp shoe; while, tied with silken strings, His muslin trowsers, and the plumes that flow From his light cap, proclaim the child of show. And, as his fan of feathers trembles oft, A nosegay of the faintest flowers that blow, Rests on a ribbon; since a heart so soft, Might rue the load, if chance the petit-maitre cough'd. Soon rattling in rude dissonance, their chains, Vertigo and pale Spleen the gaudy glare Would interrupt; and to a windmill's vanes Fasten, unheeding their shrill screams, the pair, And drive them dizzily around in air, Till, in a livid swoon each died away; When now, recovering, from the rich pearl chair They witness'd as before, in bright array, The fleeting fashions rise, and o'er the cieling play. On a rush bed, amidst a cavern damp, A damsel lay, to dreadful penance doom'd, The victim of fell Incubus and Cramp, Who had, in life, to pleasure idly bloom'd, As in the prurient love-feast she consum'd, Mid sister saints, the hypocritic night; Till pale from watchings, and at length entomb'd, She sunk into the shades, a beauteous sprite, Tho' form'd for sensual bliss, debarr'd each keen delight. Beside her, Cramp, as, shrivell'd up he clung To clustring swallows, caught the damsel's sighs, When on a sudden, up the pigmy sprung, To a dire monster of enormous size, Then shrunk into himself in agonies. Now, as all muscle, he appear'd to strain His limbs, and look'd as if his bursting eyes Within their sockets he could scarce contain, Now hiccup'd thrice, and laugh'd, and hiccup'd thrice again. Scarce could the weary maid a moment doze, (Ah, never her's was balmy slumber sweet) Ere a cold touch benumb'd her legs, and froze The extremer parts, like winter's arrowy sleet. “One little pause of rest no more to greet “Is mine!” (she cried) “no earthly cataplasm “Alas! could ease the torment of my feet!” While grinn'd invisible the fiend of spasm, Then sought his swallow-nook, within the noisome chasm. Meantime had Night-mare, midst a meteor's glare, Stretch'd her huge limbs, when out flew many a bat, That slept within her leathern breasts, and there Oft drew her paps, like any human brat; Or fann'd her, on her hairy buttock squat, Spreading their skinny pinions of tann'd hue: Then ruminating as the monster sat, She gather'd from the cypress and dark yew, Mixt with the froth of toads, a deleterious dew. Eftsoons in office, that infernal imp, Whose power can youth's gay visions intercept, Not emulous, it seems, of Vulcan's limp, But apeing Mercury, on the rush-couch leap'd, As one short moment, tho' with sighs, she slept, And shook the cavern with a gamesome jerk; With stealthy cunning on her belly crept, Ey'd the lorn fair one with a hideous smirk, And, half-relenting, cried—“Alas! 'tis rueful work!” Deep-fever'd blushes ting'd her lovely face, Her mouth half-open'd to the murky night: Her bosom panting with disorder'd grace, Heav'd its blue veins, and glow'd with rosy light. Loose were her shadowy tresses: snowy-white Her right hand, backward thrown, sustain'd her head That seem'd to throb with anguish; when the sprite Shook o'er her breast the mane of dingy red, And rais'd the poison'd hoof, and all its venom shed. While quiver'd in paralysis her limbs, With suffocative sighs opprest she lay: And lo, as in the dews of death she swims, She strives to scream with many a vain essay; And starts from ghostly forms in chill dismay! At length she moans, and utters a low shriek; When, as she seems to feel a lump of clay From her breast tumbling, tremulously weak, Scarce can she lift her hand to touch her hectic cheek. Insulting sore a methodistic crone, With pallid hand as Hypochondria stroak'd Her aching stomach to a bladder blown; The sufferer, with throat-globules well nigh choakt, Now crawl'd a bloated toad, and crawling croak'd; Now, seiz'd with dizziness, o'er many a rood Lay floating a huge whale, and oft provok'd By fell harpooners, dash'd the fervent flood; And in delirium seem'd to fill all space with blood. Here Catalepsy, lost in thought intense, Her heavy temples with the poppy crown'd, Her victim would benumb in every sense, And fix his leaden eye-balls to the ground, And his stone tongue chain up, “without a sound.” There too, her sister bade a wan wretch smite His breast, and high to catch the vapours bound, Dash in the dust his writhing limbs, and bite His livid lips in foam, and dart pernicious light. There, whilst the Dog-star pour'd upon his head Siriasis! thy pestilential blaze, Struck by the beams, thy victim, as he fled, Stopp'd in mid-course, and star'd with ghastly gaze; And, as the mist of darkness seem'd to glaze His eye-balls, strove to seize, with ardour vain, A cooling rill that curl'd thro' many a maze; Then, smitten by the fiery beams again, Pursued the elusive lymph, and beat his burning brain. There Terror, mounting an infuriate horse, Towards a precipice of bare rock flew, And its mane grasping, in a bloody corse Oft bath'd its hoofs, and oft a saint o'erthrew, While from the steed's broad nostrils vapours blue Stream'd forth, and from its eyes the Siroc's glare; When laughing midst his methodistic crew, Madness danc'd round, and started grim Despair; And Terror's self shrunk back, and rais'd his bristling hair. So dire the fiends, amidst hell's concave rag'd, Who, the earth vexing, by a kindred train, War, ever and anon, with mortals wag'd, But, chiefly with the votaries of the fane; Who, as descending to the dark domain A saintly ghost demure attention drew, Would, each, the mental and corporeal pain That from the body rent the soul, renew, And with appropriate pangs the suffering wretch pursue. The doughty chief, while thus, to daze the sight, The vision floating round and round him, rose, Spied the devil seated on a mountain's height, That flaming labour'd with volcanic throes; And beckoning to the throne his fearstruck foes, Bade them ‘no more their tyrant's nod obey, ‘On Methodists inflicting bitter woes, ‘But pour their vengeance on their proper prey— ‘On infants unbaptiz'd, and priests more damn'd than they.’ He spoke. And Satan, a fierce lightning fork That hiss'd within the hollow crater, seiz'd, And seem'd in act to speed its deathful work, When Aaron high his Leucophyllon rais'd; And, as in air the sulphur idly blaz'd, Fix'd Satan trembling to the mountain's crest! The vassal monsters, as in triumph, gaz'd; St. Vitus paus'd, his rapid rounds represt, Vertigo firmly stood, and e'en Despair had rest. “Subdued” (says Aaron, as he swell'd in size Gigantic) “see, subdued the dire domain! And, (waving strait his rod) “Behold,” he cries, “Hell vanishes! we tread on earth again!” “Indeed” (quoth Drywit, in a doleful strain,) “Whether on earth or not, I scarce can tell! “Something, methinks, disturbs your Honour's brain! “But, d?me! by to-morrow, if you dwell “In this accursed hole, you'll find yourself in hell!” PASTORAL PIECES. THYRSIS. FROM THEOCRITUS: IDYLL. I. THYRSIS. Yon breezy pine, that shades the limpid springs, In many a vocal whisper sweetly sings: Sweet too the warblings of thy breathing reed: Thine, Goatherd, next to Pan, is music's meed! For, if the god receive a horn'd he-goat, The female shall attend thy Dorian oat: But if the rights of Sylvan Pan forbid, And he the female claim, be thine a kid. GOATHERD. Sweeter thy music, than the streams that roll In liquid murmur down yon rocky knoll! If one white ewe reward the Muse's strain, A stall-fed lamb awaits the shepherd-swain: But if the gentler lambkin please the Nine, Melodious Thyrsis, then the ewe be thine. THYRSIS. Come, where these tamarisks cool the fervid air, Rest on this bank—the vocal reed thy care! Come, wilt thou tune, to charm the nymphs, thy lay? I'll feed thy goats, if thou consent to play. GOATHERD. We dare not, shepherd, at the hour of noon, Our pipes to rustic melodies attune: 'Tis Pan we fear: from hunting he returns, As all in silence hush'd, the noon-day burns; And, tir'd, reposes 'mid the woodland scene, Whilst on his nostrils sits a bitter spleen. But come, (since Daphnis' woes to thee are known; And well we deem the rural Muse thine own,) Let us, at ease, beneath that elm recline, Where sculptur'd Naïds o'er their fountains shine; While gay Priapus guards the sweet retreat, And oaks, wide-branching, shade yon pastoral seat. And, Thyrsis, if thou sing so soft a strain As erst contending with the Libyan Swain; Thrice shalt thou milk that goat for such a lay; Two kids she rears, yet fills two pails a day. With this, I'll stake (o'erlaid with wax it stands, And smells just recent from the graver's hands) My large two-handled cup, rich-wrought and deep; Around whose brim pale ivy seems to creep, With helichryse entwin'd: small tendrils hold Its saffron fruit in many a clasping fold. Within, high-touch'd, a female figure shines;— Her cawl—her vest—how soft the waving lines! And near, two youths (bright ringlets grace their brows) Breathe in alternate strife their amorous vows! On each, by turns, the faithless fair-one smiles, And views the rival pair with wanton wiles. Brimful, thro' passion, swell their twinkling eyes; And their full bosoms heave with fruitless sighs! Amidst the scene, a fisher, grey with years, On the rough summit of a rock appears; And labouring, with one effort, as he stands, To throw his large net, drags it with both hands! So muscular his limbs attract the sight— You'd swear the fisher stretch'd with all his might. Round his hoar neck, each swelling vein displays A vigour worthy youth's robuster days! Next, red ripe grapes in bending clusters glow: A boy, to watch the vineyard, sits below! Two foxes round him skulk: this slily gapes, To catch a luscious morsel of the grapes; But that, in ambush, aiming at the scrip, Thinks 'tis too sweet a moment to let slip— And cries: “It suits my tooth—the little dunce— “I'll send him dinnerless away, for once!” He, idly-busy, with his rush-bound reeds Weaves locust-traps; nor scrip nor vineyard heeds. Flexile around its sides the acanthus twin'd, Strikes as a miracle of art the mind. This cup (from Calydon it cross'd the seas) I bought for a she-goat, and new-made cheese! As yet unsoil'd, nor touch'd by lip of mine, My friend, this masterpiece of wood be thine, For thy lov'd hymn so sweet, a willing meed! Sure sweeter flows not from the pastoral reed! And yet I envy not thy proudest boast— Thy music cannot reach oblivion's coast. THYRSIS. Begin, sweet Muses, your bucolic woe, Lo, Etna's swain! 'tis Thyrsis' notes that flow! Where stray'd ye, nymphs, when Daphnis pin'd with love? Thro' Peneus' vale, or Pindus' steepy grove? For not Anapus' flood your steps delay'd— Or Acis' sacred wave, or Etna's shade! Begin, sweet Muses, your bucolic woe, In melting cadence may the numbers flow. Gaunt wolves and pards deplor'd his parting breath; And e'en the forest-lion mourn'd his death. Begin, &amp;c. Bulls, cows, and steers, stood drooping at his side, And wail'd, in sorrow, as the shepherd died. Begin, &amp;c. First, the wing'd Hermes from the mountain came: “Whence, Daphnis, whence, he cried, this fatal flame?” Begin, &amp;c. The Goatherds, Hinds, and Shepherds, all enquir'd— “What ail'd the Herdsman? and what fever fir'd?” Priapus came—and cried—‘Ah, Daphnis, say, ‘Does Love, poor Daphnis, steal thy soul away? ‘She with bare feet, thro' woods and fountains roves— ‘Exclaiming, “Hah, too thoughtless in thy loves! “Hah! what tho' Herdsman be thy purer name, “Sure, all the Goatherd marks thy lawless flame. “He views with leering eyes his goats askance, “Notes their keen sport, and pines in every glance! “Thus, while the virgin-train, fleet bounding by, “Weave the gay dance, and titter at thy sigh; “Perfidious man! each laugh lights up desire, “That wastes thy gloting eyes with wanton fire!” Silent he sat—and burning every vein Throbb'd thro' dire love, 'till Death extinguish'd pain. Begin, &amp;c. Next Venus' self the hapless youth addrest, (With faint, forc'd smiles, yet anger at her breast) ‘Well, Daphnis, art thou still a match for Love? ‘Say, does not Cupid now the victor prove?’ Begin, &amp;c. But he: ‘Too true, thou say'st, that Love hath won! ‘Too sure thy triumphs mark my setting sun!’ Begin, &amp;c. ‘Fly, where Anchises—to his arms away— ‘And screen your pleasures from the garish day, ‘On Ida's hill: there spread o'er-arching groves; ‘There many an oak will hide your covert loves; ‘There the broad rush, in matted verdure, thrives; ‘There bees, in busy swarms, hum round their hives. Begin, &amp;c. ‘Adonis too—tho' delicately fair— ‘He feeds his flocks, and hunts the flying hare. Begin, &amp;c. ‘Say,—if arm'd Diomed should meet thy sight— ‘I've conquer'd Daphnis—come, renew the fight! Begin, &amp;c. ‘Ye wolves and bears and panthers of the woods; ‘Ye glens and copses and ye foaming floods; ‘Ye waters, who your waves of silver roll ‘Near Thymbris' towers, that once cou'd soothe my soul— ‘And thou, dear—dear auspicious Arethuse! ‘O once the sweet inspirer of my Muse, ‘Farewell:—no more, alas! shall Daphnis rove ‘Amidst your haunts; for Daphnis dies of love! Begin, &amp;c. ‘I—I am he, who lowing oxen fed; ‘Who to their well-known brook my heifers led. Begin, &amp;c. ‘Pan—Pan—of all our woodlands the delight, ‘Whether thou rovest on Lycæum's height, ‘Or o'er the mighty Mænalus, O deign ‘To visit sweet Sicilia's pastoral plain. ‘Leave Lycaonian Helicas' high tomb, ‘Tho' gods revere the monumental gloom! Close, heavenly Muse, the tale of pastoral woe! Ah! let the melting cadence cease to flow! ‘O Pan, my reeds so close-compacted take, ‘And call forth all their tones for Daphnis' sake! ‘Bent for thy lip this pipe be thine to play— ‘To the drear grave love hurries me away! Close, &amp;c. ‘Ye thorns and brambles the pale vi'let bear— ‘Ye junipers, produce narcissus fair! ‘Ye pines, with fruitage from the pear-tree crown'd, ‘Mark Daphnis' death, while all things change around— ‘Let stags pursue the beagles o'er the plain, ‘And screech-owls rival Philomela's strain.’ Close, &amp;c. He ceas'd—and Venus would have rais'd his head— But Fate had spun his last-remaining thread; And Daphnis past the lake! The o'erwhelming tide Buried the nymphs' delight—the Muse's pride! Close, &amp;c. Now, fairly, friend, I claim the cup and goat— Her milk, a sweet libation, I devote To you, ye Niue, inspirers of my lay! Be mine a loftier song, some future day. GOATHERD. Thyrsis! thy mouth may figs Ægilean fill; And luscious honey on thy lips distil! For sweeter, shepherd, is thy charming song, Than ev'n Cicadas sing the boughs among. Behold thy cup, so scented, that it seems Imbued with fragrance at the fountain streams, Where sport the Hours!—Come, Ciss! May Thyrsis' pail Bespeak the richness of thy pasture-vale! THE HARVEST-FEAST; OR, THE VERNAL VOYAGE. FROM THEOCRITUS: IDYLL. VII. Twas at the time when reigns the rural joke, That Eucritus and I, from city-smoke, (Join'd by our friend Amyntas) pac'd our way To the fresh fields that green round Halys lay There Lycops' sons their harvest-offerings paid, And the rich honours of the feast display'd— Great Lycops' generous sons—if any good Flow down, transmitted with illustrious blood! From Clytia's and from Chalcon's line they came, Ev'n Chalcon shining in the rolls of fame; From whose strong knee imprest upon the rock, In sudden springs the Burine fountain broke! Elms, rising round, in various verdure glow'd; And the dim poplar's quivering foliage flow'd! Scarce half the journey measur'd, (ere our eyes Could see the tomb of Brasylas arise,) Glad we o'ertook young Lycidas of Crete, Whose Muse could warble many a ditty sweet! His rustic trade might easily be seen, For all could read the goatherd in his mien. A goat's white skin that smelt as newly flay'd, His shoulders loosely with its shag array'd: His wide-wove girdle brac'd around his breast A cloak, whose tatter'd shreds its age confest! His right hand held a rough wild olive-crook, And as we join'd, he cast a leering look From his arch hazle-eye—while laughter hung Upon his lips, and pleasure mov'd his tongue: ‘Where—where my friend Simichidas so fast, ‘Ere now the heats of sultry noon are past, ‘While sleeping in each hedge the lizard lies, ‘And not a crested lark swims o'er the skies? ‘Hah! thou art trudging for some dainty bit; ‘Or tread'st, besure, the wine-press for a cit! ‘Struck by thy hurrying clogs, the pebbles leap! ‘And, I'll be sworn, they ring at every step!’ ‘Well met, dear Lycidas, (I strait replied) ‘No shepherd-swain, or reaper, e'er outvied ‘The music of thy pipe, as stories tell;— ‘I'm glad on't—Yet, I hope, I pipe as well! ‘Invited by our liberal friends, we go ‘Where the rich first-fruits of the harvest flow ‘To bless the fair-veil'd goddess, who with stores ‘Of ripen'd corn high-heap'd their groaning floors. ‘But let us carol the bucolic lay, ‘Since ours one common sun, one common way: ‘Alternate transport may our songs infuse— ‘The “honey'd mouth”—all name me—of the Muse! ‘All praise, in rapture, my poetic worth: ‘But I'm incredulous, I swear by earth! ‘I rival (conscious of my humbler strain) ‘Philetas or Sicelidas, in vain! ‘And tho' my melodies may soothe a friend, ‘A croaking frog with locusts, I contend!’ Thus, artful, I.—But with arch smiles the youth Exclaim'd, ‘Thou art a sprig of Jove, in truth! ‘And need'st not, sure, from just applauses shrink— ‘This crook be thine, to witness what I think. ‘I scorn the builder, as of mean account, ‘Whose lofty fabric would o'ertop the mount ‘Of proud Oromedon! Thus idly vie ‘The muse-cocks, who the Chian bird defy. ‘But let's begin, since time is on the wing; ‘And each, in turn, some sweet bucolic sing! ‘I'll chaunt (your ear with pleasure may they fill) ‘The strains I lately labour'd, on the hill. “O may the ship that wafts my Daphne, glide “To Mitylene, o'er a favouring tide! “Tho' southern winds their watery pinions spread, “And stern Orion broods o'er Ocean's bed. “So may her smile a lenient med'cine prove, “To cool the fever of consuming love! “And may the bleak south-east no longer rave, “But gentle Halcyons smooth the ripling wave— “Sweet Halcyons, lov'd by all the Nereid train “Above each bird that skims, for food, the main. “O may my fair-one reach the quiet bay; “And every blessing speed her destin'd way! “Then with white vi'lets shall my brows be crown'd “With anise-wreaths, or rosy garlands bound! “Then, at my hearth, the Ptelean bowl be quaff'd— “And the parch'd bean add flavour to the draught! “Then, as my elbows high my couch shall swell, “Of parsley form'd, and golden asphodel; “Then to my Daphne's health I'll drink, at ease, “The sparkling juice, and drain it to the lees! “Whilst with their pipes two swains delight my ear; “And Tityrus sweetly sings, reclining near, “How herdsman Daphnis lov'd the frowning maid; “And, with vain sighs, o'er many a mountain stray'd:— “How the rough oaks, where Himera's waters flow, “Told to the passing stream, his tale of woe. “For as on Caucasus, or Athos brow, “Or Rhodope's, he breath'd the fruitless vow— “Or Hœmus' hill; he sunk, thro' love, away, “Like snows dissolving in the solar ray. “Next shall he sing—how tyranny opprest “The goatherd, prison'd in his ample chest! “And how the bees from flowery meadows bore “Their balms, and fed him with the luscious store! “For on his lips the favour of the Muse “Distill'd the nectar of her sweetest dews! “To thee, Comates, tho' confin'd so fast, “Sure, with quick pace, the vernal season past; “Happy, amid thy prison, all day long, “While honey dropp'd delicious on thy tongue! “O hadst thou liv'd with us, a brother swain, “How oft my charmed ears had caught thy strain! “Thy goats upon the mountains had I fed, “Or o'er the tufted vales, with pleasure led! “Then had thy voice its sweetest powers display'd, “Beneath the embowering oak, or pine-tree shade.” He ceas'd—and thus alternate I replied: ‘Sweet Lycidas, of goatherd-youths the pride! ‘What time I drove my herds, the hills along, ‘The charming Wood-Nymphs taught me many a song: ‘Then hear (since thou hast gain'd the Muse's love) ‘Strains, whose high fame hath reach'd the throne of Jove! ‘Then hear the choicest of the lays I know— ‘In honour of thy name the numbers flow. “On me the Cupids sneez'd, who Myrta love “As kids the verdure of the vernal grove! “With the same fires my dear Aratus glows; “And this full well the soft Aristis knows— “Aristis, who can Phœbus' self inspire, “In sweet accordance, ev'n with Phœbus' lyre! “O Pan, for whom fair Omole displays “Its green abodes, attend Aratus' lays! “O bid her fly uncall'd into his arms, “Whether dear Myrta, or Philina charms! “So shall no more Arcadian youths deface “With scaly squills thy form, tho' vain the chace! “But if thou smile not on the lover's cause, “Be stung by nettles—torn by harpy-claws; “Freeze, in mid winter, near the torpid pole, “On Edon, where the streams of Hebrus roll; “And as an Æthiop burn, while summer glows, “Where the hot Blemyan rocks o'er Nilus close. “Ye Loves, whose cheeks the apple's bloom outvie— “Come—from your Byblis' favourite murmurs fly! “Leave—leave the waves of Hyetis; and bless “The yellow-hair'd Dione's sweet recess! “Shoot, with unerring aim, the tinctur'd dart; “And pierce Philina's yet unwounded heart! “But—‘as the melting pear’—(the rival maids “Exclaim)—‘Philina's mellow beauty fades!” “Then, dear Aratus! let us watch no more, “Nor wear, with nightly toil, the bolted door! “Some other, as the morn begins to peep, “May the cock's clarion give to broken sleep! “His limbs in listless languor may he stretch, “And so we rest, a halter end the wretch! “Ours be repose—and some enchantress wait, “To ward, far off, each evil from our gate.” I sung, and (as presenting me his crook He smil'd) the hospitable token took! Then, parting, to the left, for Pyxa's towers He turn'd; while we to Phrasidamus' bowers Slop'd o'er the right-hand path our speedy way, And hail'd the pleasures of the festal day. There, in kind courtesy, our host had spread Of vine and lentisk the refreshing bed! Their breezy coolness elms and poplars gave, And rills their murmur, from the Naïds cave! Cicadas now retiring from the sun, Amid the shady shrubs, their song begun. From the thick copse we heard, far off, and lone, The mellow'd shrillness of the woodlark's tone! Warbled the linnet and the finch more near, And the soft-sighing turtle sooth'd the ear! The yellow bees humm'd pleasant in the shade, And round the fountain's flowery margin play'd. All breath'd of every summer-smell, that greets The sense—all breath'd of ripe autumnal sweets— Here pears, and thick-strown apples, there the glow Of bending plums, that kiss'd the turf below! Our wines four years had mellow'd in the cask— And could Alcides boast so rich a flask, (Say nymphs of Castaly) when Chiron gave The generous juice, in Pholus' stony cave! Or did such nectar, at Anapus' stream, Rouse to the dance the Cyclops Polypheme (Who hurls the mountain-rocks across the brine) As, nymphs, ye mix'd at Ceres' glowing shrine? O! may I fix the purging fan, again, Delightful task! amid her heaps of grain; And, in each hand, the laughing goddess hold The poppy's vivid red—the ears of gold! EUNICA; OR, THE NEATHERD. FROM THEOCRITUS: IDYLL. XX. Lord! when to kiss the city-maid I tried, How proud she look'd; and flouted me, and cried, ‘Away, thou rustic! nor my lips profane— ‘Dost think I ever learnt to kiss a swain? ‘No—I delight in city-lips alone— ‘Thou should'st not kiss me in a dream—begone. ‘No—Caitiff—hands so tawny—lips so thick— ‘And such a smell! Begone! for I am sick!’ She spoke—and spitting thrice, the saucy slut Titter'd, and ey'd me o'er from head to foot; And frown'd, and winc'd about to shew her shape, And laugh'd aloud, and mutter'd—‘What an ape!’ Wild as she flung away, I speechless stood: In anger boil'd the current of my blood! Quick to my face the flushing crimson flew, And like a rose I look'd o'ercharg'd with dew! Still—still resentment in my breast I bear— That she should scorn a youth so passing fair! But say, my comrade-swains, and tell me truth— Am not I bright in all the bloom of youth? Or else what god hath fashion'd me anew? Erst my fair form shone lovely to the view! My beard, soft spread, like clasping ivy, clung; My locks, like parsley, down my temples hung! White o'er my sable eye-brows—snowy-white— My open forehead seem'd one lustrous light! My eyes, a living azure as they stream'd, Than bright Minerva's more divinely beam'd. My lips, like cream, with dulcet sounds replete, Dropp'd music than the honey-comb more sweet; And all enchanting flow'd the liquid note, Or from my pipe, or flute, or Dorian oat! The girls upon the hills confess my charms, And, sighing, long to clasp me in their arms! But for this flirt—so tinctur'd with the town— Who scorns, forsooth, the proffers of a clown; She never knew that Bacchus, tho' divine, Pastur'd, amidst the vales, his lowing kine; That Venus ev'n to cits a swain preferr'd, And help'd him, on the hill, to feed his herd; Or, fir'd by fair Adonis, that in groves The Paphian Queen enjoy'd and mourn'd her loves. And was not sweet Endymion's self a swain— Whom Luna lov'd, descending to the plain, Whilst for the Latmian lawn she left her sphere? And did not Rhea hold a herdsman dear? Nay—'twas thy will thro' woodland haunts to rove Ev'n for a little herdsboy, Father Jove! And yet a neatherd's love Eunica thinks Beneath her notice—the conceited minx! And vaunts her graceful air—unmatch'd, I ween, By Rhea, Cynthia, or the Cyprian Queen! Bewitching beauty! Tho', besure, we see A second Cytherea bloom in thee, O may'st thou sigh, for aye—and sigh in vain— To kiss thy lover of the town again! Despis'd by every cit, be thine to prove The hill's rude breezes for a herdsman's love; But may the rustic's scorn thy crime atone, And slighted, may'st thou sleep all night—alone! DAPHNIS AND SHEPHERDESS. FROM THEOCRITUS: IDYLL. XXVII. DAPHNIS. Young Paris the Trojan, who tended his herd, To the fair-ones of Troy a Greek beauty preferr'd. He stole the gay charmer, an amorous felon; I boast a free kiss from a sweeter than Helen! SHEPHERDESS. A kiss is so empty: You satyr!—Poh! poh! DAPHNIS. And yet there's some pleasure in kissing, I trow! [Kisses her. SHEPHERDESS. I wipe then my mouth, and your kisses disdain! DAPHNIS. Do you wipe? Come, I'm ready for bussing again— SHEPHERDESS. Kiss your heifers; nor worry a virgin, you lout! DAPHNIS. Indeed! but remember, tho' now you may flout, That your beauty, however 'tis held in esteem, Will fade, haughty girl, and be gone, like a dream. SHEPHERDESS. The grape, when it's dried, is delicious in taste, And the rose is still sweet when its blushes are past. DAPHNIS. Come hither; I've something to whisper, my maid— These wild olives form an agreeable shade. SHEPHERDESS. No—no—Mr. Wag! 'tis a little too soon To be dup'd so again! DAPHNIS. Then I'll play you a tune Beneath yonder elms! SHEPHERDESS. Go, and play to yourself! I cannot attend to so wretched an elf! DAPHNIS. Ah, maiden, of Venus's anger beware! SHEPHERDESS. Her anger! Diana alone is my care! DAPHNIS. Take heed, lest the goddess, whom thus you defy, Should rivet a knot you may never untie! SHEPHERDESS. No fear, while Diana continues to watch; Be quiet—hands off—or, I swear, I will scratch. DAPHNIS. You may vaunt, as you like, your slim delicate shape— But the fate of your sex you can never escape! SHEPHERDESS. Believe me, by Pan, I'll be never a wife; But may you bear the yoke all the days of your life! DAPHNIS. In the end, I much fear you will marry some brute. SHEPHERDESS. Many wooers I've had, but no wooer would suit! DAPHNIS. What think you of me? SHEPHERDESS. Why, my friend, without jest, I think Hymen's yoke is a burthen at best. DAPHNIS. No: marriage is nothing but pleasure— SHEPHERDESS. When wives By their husbands are terrified out of their lives! DAPHNIS. No, maiden! the fact is, that wives domineer: Whom was ever a woman discover'd to fear? SHEPHERDESS. I'm most of the perils of child-birth afraid— DAPHNIS. Your guardian Diana's a midwife by trade. SHEPHERDESS. Yet I tremble! it ruins, at last, the complexion! DAPHNIS. Your children will make up the loss in affection! SHEPHERDESS. But where is my jointure, if I should consent? DAPHNIS. My fields and my woodlands, in all their extent, With my flocks and my herds— SHEPHERDESS. Then an oath you shall take That you love me with truth, and will never forsake. DAPHNIS. Yes, tho' you endeavour to force me away, By Pan, whom we worship, I swear I will stay. SHEPHERDESS. Will you build me a lodging, and sheep-cote, and bed? DAPHNIS. Yes all—and my pastures with flocks are o'erspread. SHEPHERDESS. But how shall I tell my old father my love? DAPHNIS. No fear: If you mention my name, he'll approve. SHEPHERDESS. Pray what are you call'd? There are charms in a name— DAPHNIS. I'm Daphnis: my father of musical fame, Old Lycid: my mother, Nomea. SHEPHERDESS. The blood Runs rich in your veins; and yet mine is as good. DAPHNIS. Not better, besure; for your father I know— Menalcas, who lives in the valley below. SHEPHERDESS. Then shew me your groves; and the cote where it lies. DAPHNIS. Come hither; and mark how my cypresses rise! SHEPHERDESS. Browse yonder, my goats, while I haste to the grove! DAPHNIS. And feed, my brave bulls—while I wanton in love! THE COTTAGE GIRL. WRITTEN ON MIDSUMMER-EVE, 1786. “Thrice hail with magic song this hallow'd hour!” Theocritus, Idyl. ii. Sweet to the fond poetic eye The evening-cloud that wanders by; Its transitory shadow pale Brushing, so still, the purpled vale! And sweet, beyond the misty stream, The wild wood's scatter'd tuftings gleam, (Where the horizon steals from sight) Cool-tinctur'd in the fainting light! Yet, sweeter than the silent scene, The manners of yon cottag'd green; Where nature breathes the genuine heart, Unvarnish'd by the gloss of art! Now glimmer scarce the hill-tops near, As village murmurs catch mine ear: And now yon cot, beside the lea, (Whence oft I hear the peasant's glee) Fades to the glimpse of twilight grey, And, in the gloom, slow sinks away! There, as her light of frugal rush Twinkles thro' the white-thorn bush, Reflected from the scanty pane, The rustic maid invokes her swain; And hails, to pensive damsels dear, This eve, tho' direst of the year! Oft on the shrub she casts her eye, That spoke her true-love's secret sigh; Or else, alas! too plainly told, Her true-love's faithless heart was cold. The moss-rose that, at fall of dew, (Ere eve its duskier curtain drew) Was freshly gather'd from its stem, She values as the ruby gem; And, guarded from the piercing air, With all an anxious lover's care, She bids it, for her shepherd's sake, Await the new-year's frolic wake— When, faded, in its alter'd hue She reads—the rustic is untrue! But, if its leaves the crimson paint, Her sickening hopes no longer faint. The rose upon her bosom worn, She meets him at the peep of morn: And lo! her lips with kisses prest, He plucks it from her panting breast. Dearer than seas of glowing pearl, The illusion soothes the cottage girl, Whilst, on this thrice-hallow'd eve, Her wishes and her fears believe All that the credulous have taught To stir the quivering pulse of thought. Now, to relieve her growing fear, That feels the haunted moment near When ghosts in chains the church-yard walk, She tries to steal the time by talk. But hark! the church-clock swings around With a dead pause each sullen sound, And tells, the midnight hour is come That wraps the groves in spectred gloom! To issue from beneath the thatch, With trembling hand she lifts the latch, And steps, as creaks the feeble door, With cautious feet her threshold o'er; Lest, stumbling on the horse-shoe dim, Dire spells unsinew every limb. Lo, shuddering at the solemn deed, She scatters round the magic seed, And thrice repeats, “The seed I sow; “My true-love's scythe the crop shall mow.” Strait, as her frame fresh horrors freeze, Her true-love with his scythe she sees! And next, she seeks the yew-tree shade, Where he who died for love is laid; There binds upon the verdant sod (By many a moon-light faery trod) The cowslip and the lily wreath She wove, her hawthorn-hedge beneath: And, whispering, “Ah, may Colin prove “As constant, as thou wast, to love—” Kisses with pale lip, full of dread, The turf that hides his clay-cold head! Then homeward, as thro' rustling trees She hears a shriek in every breeze, In forms her flutter'd spirits give Each shivering leaf appears to live. At length, her love-sick projects tried, She gains her cot the lea beside; And on her pillow sinks to rest, With dreams of constant Colin blest; While, east-along, the ruddy streak Colours the shadows at day-break! Such are the phantoms love can raise; As first his gradual ardour strays O'er the young virgin's thrilling frame; A sweet delirium in the flame! Her bosom's gently rising swell, And purple light, the tumult tell— The melting blush upon her cheek, The sigh, the glance, her passion speak! And now, some favourite object near, She feels the throbs of hope and fear; And, all unknowing to conceal The ingenuous soul by fashion's veil, Tries every art to feed her fires That fond credulity inspires. Nor love alone, in vernal youth, Bids airy fancy mimic truth. The cottager, or maid, or wife, Each dear deception owns thro' life: Whether, as superstitions sway, O'er upland dews she slopes her way, Hailing, on Easter's holy morn, The spotless lamb thro' ether borne, Which her adoring eyes behold, Mid orient skies of molten gold; Or whether, if disease assail In shape of shivering tertian pale, For Tray, what time the fit began, She breaks the salted cake of bran, Transferring with the charmed bit To fawning Tray her ague fit; Or, as the recent grave she delves, (Ere dawn dissolve the circling elves) Where the last youth was lock'd in sleep, The sacred salt she buries deep— Thus nine times (no companion nigh To cheer the night-envelop'd sky) Revisiting the charnel ground, “Her tongue chain'd up without a sound.” 'Tis thus fantastic visions rise, To cheat the unweeting damsel's eyes. Nor bending age, nor pining want, The faery prospect disenchant: But, stor'd with many a trancing charm, A thousand phantoms round her swarm; 'Till now the villagers, o'eraw'd, Her various feats in wonder laud; And, arm'd with her associate switch, She dwindles to—a wither'd witch! ELEGIAC PIECES. THE ELEGIES OF TYRTÆUS. ELEGY THE FIRST. I would not value, or transmit the fame Of him, whose brightest worth in swiftness lies; Nor would I chaunt his poor unwarlike name Who wins no chaplet but the wrestler's prize. In vain, for me, the Cyclops' giant might Blends with the beauties of Tithonus' form; In vain the racer's agile powers unite, Fleet as the whirlwind of the Thracian storm. In vain, for me, the riches round him glow A Midas or a Cinyras possess'd; Sweet as Adrastus' tongue his accents flow, Or Pelops' sceptre seems to stamp him blest. Vain all the dastard honours he may boast, If his soul thirst not for the martial field; Meet not the fury of the rushing host, Nor bear o'er hills of slain the untrembling shield. This—this is virtue: This—the noblest meed That can adorn our youth with fadeless rays; While all the perils of the adventurous deed, The new-strung vigour of the state repays. Amid the foremost of the embattled train, Lo the young hero hails the glowing fight; And, tho' fall'n troops around him press the plain, Still fronts the foe, nor brooks inglorious flight. His life—his fervid soul oppos'd to death, He dares the terrours of the field defy; Kindles each spirit with his panting breath, And bids his comrade-warriours nobly die! See, see, dismay'd, the phalanx of the foe Turns round, and hurries o'er the plain afar; While doubling, as afresh, the deadly blow, He rules, intrepid chief, the waves of war. Now fall'n, the noblest of the van, he dies, His city by the beauteous death renown'd; His low-bent father marking, where he lies, The shield, the breast-plate hackt by many a wound. The young, the aged, alike mingling tears— His country's heavy grief bedews the grave; And all his race in verdant lustre wears Fame's richest wreath, transmitted from the brave. Tho' mixt with earth the perishable clay, His name shall live, while glory loves to tell, ‘True to his country how he won the day, ‘How firm the hero stood, how calm he fell!’ But if he 'scape the doom of death (the doom To long—long dreary slumbers) he returns, While trophies flash, and victor-laurels bloom, And all the splendour of the triumph burns. The old—the young—caress him, and adore; And with the city's love, thro' life, repay'd, He sees each comfort, that endears, in store, Till, the last hour, he sinks to Pluto's shade. Old as he droops, the citizens, o'eraw'd, (Ev'n veterans) to his mellow glories yield; Nor would in thought dishonour or defraud The hoary soldier of the well-fought field. Be your's to reach such eminence of fame; To gain such heights of virtue nobly dare, My youths! and, 'mid the fervour of acclaim, Press, press to glory; nor remit the war! ELEGY THE SECOND. Rouse, rouse, my youths! the chain of torpour break; Spurn idle rest, and couch the glittering lance! What! Does not shame with blushes stain your cheek Quick-mantling, as ye catch the warriour's glance? Ignoble youths! Say, when shall valour's flame Burn in each breast? Here, here, while hosts invade, And war's wild clangours all your courage claim, Ye sit, as if still peace embower'd the shade. But, sure, fair honour crowns the auspicious deed, When patriot love impels us to the field; When, to defend a trembling wife, we bleed, And when our shelter'd offspring bless the shield. What time the fates ordain, pale death appears: Then, with firm step and sword high drawn, depart; And, marching thro' the first thick shower of spears, Beneath thy buckler guard the intrepid heart. Each mortal, tho' he boast celestial sires, Slave to the sovereign destiny of death, Or mid the carnage of the plain expires, Or yields unwept at home his coward breath. Yet sympathy attends the brave man's bier; Sees on each wound the balmy grief bestow'd; And, as in death the universal tear, Thro' life inspires the homage of a god. For like a turret his proud glories rise, And stand, above the rival's reach, alone; While millions hail, with fond adoring eyes, The deeds of many a hero meet in one! ELEGY THE THIRD. Yet are ye Hercules' unconquer'd race— Remand, heroic tribe, your spirit lost! Not yet all-seeing Jove averts his face; Then meet without a fear the thronging host. Each to the foe his steady shield oppose, Accoutred to resign his hateful breath: The friendly sun a mild effulgence throws On valour's grave, tho' dark the frown of death. Yes! ye have known the ruthless work of war! Yes! ye have known its tears—its heavy woe; When, scattering in pale flight, ye rush'd afar, Or chas'd the routed squadrons of the foe. Of those who dare, a strong compacted band, Firm for the fight their warriour-spirits link, And grapple with the foeman, hand to hand, How few, thro' deadly wounds expiring, sink. They, foremost in the ranks of battle, guard The inglorious multitude that march behind; While shrinking fears the coward's step retard, And dies each virtue in the feeble mind. But 'tis not in the force of words to paint What varied ills attend the ignoble troop, Who trembling on the scene of glory faint, Or wound the fugitives that breathless droop. Basely the soldier stabs, with hurried thrust, The unresisting wretch, that shieldless flies! At his last gasp dishonour'd in the dust (His back transfix'd with spears) the dastard lies! Thus then, bold youth, the rules of valour learn: Stand firm, and fix on earth thy rooted feet; Bite with thy teeth thy eager lips; and stern In conscious strength, the rushing onset meet: And shelter with thy broad and bossy shield Thy thighs and shins, thy shoulders and thy breast; The long spear ponderous in thy right-hand wield, And on thy head high nod the dreadful crest. Mark well the lessons of the warlike art, That teach thee, if the shield with ample round Protect thy bosom, to approach the dart, Nor chuse with timid care the distant ground. But, for close combat with the fronting foe, Elate in valorous attitude draw near; And aiming, hand to hand, the fateful blow, Brandish thy temper'd blade or massy spear. Yes! for the rage of stubborn grapple steel'd, Grasp the sword's hilt, and couch the long-beat lance; Foot to the foeman's foot, and shield to shield, Crest ev'n to crest, and helm to helm, advance. But ye light-arm'd, who, trembling in the rear, Bear smaller targets, at a distance, throw The hissing stone, or hurl the polisht spear, (Plac'd nigh your panoply) to mar the foe. ELEGY THE FOURTH. If, fighting for his dear paternal soil, The soldier in the front of battle fall; 'Tis not in fickle fortune to despoil His store of fame, that shines the charge of all. But if, opprest by penury, he rove Far from his native town and fertile plain; And lead the sharer of his fondest love Is youth too tender, with her infant train; And if his aged mother—his shrunk sire Join the sad groupe; see many a bitter ill Against the houseless family conspire, And all the measure of the wretched fill. Pale shivering want, companion of his way, He meets the lustre of no pitying eye, To hunger and dire infamy a prey: Dark hatred scowls, and scorn quick passes by. Alas! no traits of beauty or of birth— No blush now lingers in his sunken face! Dies every feeling (as he roams o'er earth) Of shame transmitted to a wandering race. But be it ours to guard this hallow'd spot, To shield the tender offspring and the wife; Here steadily await our destin'd lot, And, for their sakes, resign the gift of life. The valorous youths, in squadrons close combin'd, Rush, with a noble impulse, to the fight! Let not a thought of life glance o'er your mind, And not a momentary dream of flight. [illeg.] your hoar seniors bent by feeble age, Whose weak knees fail, tho' strong their ardour glows; [illeg.] leave such warriours to the battle's rage, But round their awful spirits firmly close. Base—base the sight, if, foremost on the plain, In dust and carnage the fall'n veteran roll; And ah! while youths shrink back, unshielded, stain His silver temples, and breathe out his soul! THE EPITAPH ON ADONIS. FROM BION. ‘Perisht Adonis!’ my full sorrows sigh! Perisht!’ the Loves—the weeping Loves reply! [illeg.] hapless Queen, thy purple robes forego— Leave thy gay couch, and snatch the weeds of woe! Beat—beat thy breast, and tell: ‘Tho’ fair he shone, ‘Alas, Adonis, tho' so fair, is gone! ‘Perisht Adonis!’ my full sorrows sigh! ‘Perisht!’ the Loves—the weeping Loves reply! I see his thigh in weltering horror bare, The wound all open to the mountain-air. He breathes! Yet, yet his eyes a pale mist dims, As the black crimson stains his snowy limbs: Lo! from his lips the rosy colour flies, And ev'n thy soothing kiss, O Venus, dies! That kiss (I view thy anguisht image near) That last fond kiss, to thee so doubly-dear! But the vain ardours of thy love give o'er— Cold—cold he lies, and feels thy breath no more. ‘Perisht Adonis!’ my full sorrows sigh! ‘Perisht!’ the Loves—the weeping Loves reply! [illeg.] in the chace his dogs stand howling round, And the pale Oreads mourn the fatal wound. The Cyprian Queen abandon'd to despair (A deeper wound her heart was doom'd to bear) Wanders amidst the thickets of the wood, Her torn unsandal'd feet distain'd with blood; And her wild tresses floating in the gale, Wails her Assyrian lord, thro' many a long, long vale! But on the mountain-brow Adonis lies, Nor hears one echo of her ceaseless cries; While, spouting from his thigh, the streams of gore His bosom erst so white empurple o'er. ‘Perisht Adonis!’ my full sorrows sigh! ‘Perisht!’ the Loves—the weeping Loves reply! Lo! Venus blooms no more in beauty's pride; With him her graces liv'd! with him they died! Those vivid blushes—those entrancing charms— That form glow'd only for Adonis' arms! The mountain-springs—the rivers, as they flow— And the hill-oaks re-murmur to her woe! The florets blush, in sorrow, at her feet; While sad in every grove, thro' every street Cythera chaunts: ‘Thy favourite youth is fled!’ Ah, Venus, mourn the fair Adonis dead! Responsive echo sighs!—Who, who can hear The lovelorn goddess moan, without a tear? Soon as she saw her lover press the ground, Wither'd his crimson thigh, and wide the wound, She stretch'd her trembling arms, and deeply sigh'd; [illeg.], ‘Stay, dear youth, a moment stay,’ (she cried) That I may clasp thee, on thy breast recline, Suck thy faint breath, and glue my lips to thine! One tender token, dear Adonis, give— Yet a short moment, while thy kisses live! Then, as in death thy sinking eyes shall roll, I'll catch the quivering spirit of thy soul, ‘Draw its quick flame, rekindled as we part; ‘Drink thy fond love, and store it in the heart! ‘Thus the last relic of affection take, ‘And here inclose it, for thy charming sake! ‘Far—far from me, to Pluto's spectred coast, ‘Belov'd Adonis! flies thy gentle ghost! ‘Wretch that I am, to breathe immortal breath, ‘That cannot join thee in the realms of death! ‘Queen of the shades, whom Fate hath giv'n to share ‘Whatever blooms on earth, or good or fair; ‘Far happier thou, take all my soul adores! ‘He comes, blest Queen, he hastens to thy shores! ‘Alas! while here my fruitless sorrows stream, ‘Love, golden love, is vanisht as a dream: ‘Their wanton charms no more my Cupids own; ‘They droop, and perisht is my virgin zone. ‘Why, form'd so fair, with every softer grace, ‘Why, sweet Adonis, urge the savage chace?’ ‘Thus Venus griev'd: and—‘Ah! thy joys are o'er’— ‘Her Cupids sobb'd—‘Adonis is no more.’ Wide as her lover's torrent-blood appears, As copious flow'd the fountain of her tears! The rose starts blushing from the sanguine dyes, And from her tears anemonies arise. ‘Perisht Adonis!’ my full sorrows sigh! ‘Perisht!’ the Loves—the weeping Loves reply! But cease to sigh unpitied to the groves The hapless story of thy vanisht loves! His velvet couch survey—nor longer weep— See his fair limbs, and mark his beauteous sleep! Come, let the bridal vest those limbs infold, And pillow his reposing head in gold! Tho' fix'd in death its pallid features frown, That visage with the flowery chaplet crown! Alas! no florets boast their glowing pride: With him their fragrance, and their colour, died! Shade him with myrtles—pour the rich perfumes— No—perish ev'ry sweet—No more Adonis blooms! His pale corse cover'd with a purple vest, Behold he lies! And lo! the Loves distrest Shear their bright locks, in agony of woe, And spurn the useless dart, and break the bow! Some quick unbind his buskin'd leg, and bring In golden urns pure water from the spring; While others gently bathe the bleeding wound, Or with light pinions fan him, fluttering round. See Hymen quench his torch, in wild despair, And scatter the connubial wreath in air! For nuptial songs, the dirge funereal sighs, While Hymen sorrows, and Adonis dies! The Graces mourn their sweet Adonis slain; And louder ev'n than thou, Dione, plain! Hark, from the Nine elegiac accents fall, (Each plaintive cadence murmuring to recall Their favourite bard) solicitous to save— Ah! can he hear? or cross the irremeable wave? Yet, Venus, cease: thy tears awhile forego— Reserve thy sorrows for the year of woe! THE EPITAPH ON BION FROM MOSCHUS. Mourn, Dorian stream, departed Bion mourn! Pour the hoarse murmur from thy pallid urn! Sigh, groves and lawns! Ye plants, in sorrow wave; Ye flowers, breathe sickly sweets o'er Bion's grave! Anemonies and roses, blush your grief; Expand, pale hyacinth, thy letter'd leaf! Thy marks of anguish more distinctly show— Ah! well the tuneful herdsman claims your woe! Begin, and in the tenderest notes complain! Sicilian Muse, begin the mournful strain! Ye nightingales that soothe the shadowy vale, Warble to Arethusa's streams the tale Of Bion dead: lamenting nature's pride, He sunk! Ah then the Dorian music died! Begin, &amp;c. Ye swans of Strymon, bid so sweet a note As Bion breath'd along your green banks, float O'er the still wave! and tell Bistonia's maids, That Doric Orpheus charms no more the glades. Begin, &amp;c. Dear to the Muse, alas! no more he sings, By yon' lone oak that shades the plashy springs. He roams a spectre thro' the glooms of fear, And chaunts the oblivious verse to Pluto's ear. O'er the hush'd hills his pensive heifers rove, Refuse their pasture, and forget their love! Begin, &amp;c. Thee—thee, O Bion, snatch'd from earth away, The satyrs wail'd, and ev'n the God of day! Pan for thy numbers heav'd his sighing breast, And sad Priapus mourn'd in sable vest. The Naïds in despairing anguish stood, And swell'd with briny tears their fountain-flood. Mute Echo, as her mimic music dies, Amidst her dreary rocks lamenting lies. The trees resign'd their fruitage, at thy death, And all the faded flowers, their scented breath. The ewes no milk—the hives no honey gave: But what avail'd it, the rich stores to save? What, that the bee no balmy floret sips, Extinct the sweeter honey of thy lips? Begin, &amp;c. Not with such grief the dolphin fill'd the seas, Or Philomela's plaint, the woodland breeze, Or Progne's bitter woe, the mountains hoar, Or wild Alcyone, the fatal shore; Or faithful Cerylus, the cave where lies His mate still breathing fondness as she dies; Or Memnon's screaming birds, his orient tomb, As now they utter at their Bion's doom! Begin, &amp;c. The love-lorn nightingales that learnt his song, The swallows twittering shrill, the boughs among, Join their sad notes; the vocal groves reply— Sigh too, ye turtles, for your Bion sigh! Begin, &amp;c. Who now, regretted swain, thy pipe shall play; Touch the fair stops, or trill the melting lay? Faint from thy lips still breathe the mellow reeds; Still on their dying sweetness Echo feeds: To bear those melodies to Pan be mine; Tho' he may fear to risk his fame with thine! Begin, &amp;c. And Galatea too bewails thy fate— Fair nymph, who oft upon the sea-shore sat Sooth'd by thy songs, and fled the Cyclops' arms— Far other strains were thine! far other charms! Now on the sand she sits—forgets the sea— Yet feeds thy herds, and still remembers thee! Begin, &amp;c. With thee, O swain, expir'd the Muse's bliss— The roseate bloom of youth, the roseate kiss! The fluttering Cupids round thy ashes cry, And fond—fond Venus mixes many a sigh! She loves thee, as Adonis' parting breath— As his last kisses so endear'd by death! Here—here, O Meles, musical in woe, And for another son thy tide shall flow! For thy first poet mourn'd thy plaintive wave; Each murmur deepen'd at thy Homer's grave: Another grief (melodious stream) appears! Alas! another poet claims thy tears! Dear to the fountains which inspire the Muse, That drank of Helicon—this, Arethuse! That bard his harp to beauteous Helen strung; And the dire anger of Pelides sung: [illeg.]—in his softer lay no wars display'd, But chanted Pan all peaceful in the shade! And fram'd his reeds, or milk'd his kine, or led His herds to pasture, singing as they fed! And oft, so dear to Venus, he carest The little Cupid in his panting breast. Begin, &amp;c. The cities and the towns thy death deplore— Than her own Hesiod Ascra mourns thee more! Not thus her Pindar Hylæ's grief bemoans— Not Lesbos thus Alcæus' manly tones! Not Ceos, Paros, thus regret their bards— And Mitylene yet thy reed regards Beyond her Sappho's lyre; and every swain Pipes thee, O Bion, on his native plain. The Samian's gentle notes thy memory greet— Philetas too—and Lycidas of Crete! Now, breathing heavy sighs, each heart despairs, Tho' erst full many a jocund revel theirs. Thee too, dear Bard, Theocritus bewails, The sweetest warbler of Sicilia's dales! And I, who suit to sorrow's melting tone The Ausonian verse, but mimic music own. If e'er the charms of melody I knew, 'Tis to thy forming skill the praise is due. Others may claim thy gold—the gold be theirs! Our be the Doric Muse, thy wealthier heirs. Begin, &amp;c. Tho' fade crisp anise, and the parsley's green, And vivid mallows from the garden-scene, The balmy breath of spring their life renews, And bids them flourish in their former hues! But we, the great, the valiant, and the wise, When once the seal of death hath clos'd our eyes, Lost in the hollow tomb obscure and deep, Slumber, to wake no more, one long unbroken sleep! Thou too, while many a scrannel reed I hear Grating eternal harshness on my ear— Thou too, thy charm of melting music o'er, But in the silent earth, shalt rise no more! Begin, &amp;c. 'Twas poison gave thee to the grasp of death— Ah! could not poison sweeten at thy breath? Who for those lips of melody could dare The venom'd chalice (murderous wretch) prepare? Such wretches rove with vengeance at their heels; While now at this drear hour my bosom feels The bursting sigh! Like Orpheus could I go, Or wise Ulysses, to the shades below; To Pluto's dome my steps should strait repair, To hear what numbers thou art chaunting there. But sing, as in the genial realms of light, Some sweet bucolic to the Queen of Night. She once amid those golden meadows play'd, And sung the Dorian song in Ætna's shade. Thy music shall ascend with all the fire— With all the strong effect of Orpheus' lyre! Fair Proserpine shall listen to thy strain, And, pitying, send thee to thy hills again. O that, as Orpheus' lyre reclaim'd his wife, My pipe had power to bring thy shade to life! THE LOCK TRANSFORMED. TO LAURA. Dear was the moment, when the gentle Fair Gave to my wishes with consenting eyes, A Lock that sever'd from her lovely hair Could soften all my bosom into sighs! And dear those moments that so sweetly stole A pang from absence, and impell'd my lyre To wake the fond emotions of the soul, In melting ardours and a poet's fire! Then Fancy stream'd her visions on the Muse, And many a transitory form portray'd, [illeg.] aërial sylphs in vivid hues, And bade their little wings the Lock o'ershade. But quick their fluid shapes dissolve in air, And other beings rise, as Fancy wills— Lo drawn by turtles in her ivory car, Appears the goddess of the Paphian hills! And thus: “That ringlet to my power resign— “For, from its kindred tresses tho' in part, “To give it brighter beauties shall be mine, “With all the skill of imitative art. “What tho' the fam'd Belinda's ravisht hair “May add new glory to the distant skies; “Yet shall thy Laura's Lock eclipse the star “That vainly shoots, and kindles as it flies!” She said—and from my hand the ringlet caught, And sudden to my wondering sight display'd Thy gift, my Laura, to a portrait wrought, With all the varied charms of light and shade! And “Here,” she cried, (while round the fluttering Loves “Breath'd on the roseate cheeks their softest blooms) Behold a nymph, more gentle than my doves, “Or zephyr, sighing 'midst my Cyprian glooms! See the pure spirit of a native grace “To all her mien a lovelier air impart! And see that meek expression of a face “Where in each genuine look we read the heart! These speaking eyes a charm from nature steal “Which vainly would the rhetor's powers supply; For ah, more sweetly-eloquent we feel “The language of the never-silent eye! Nor let her Attic robe escape thy view “That no vain-tinsell'd pageantry betrays— Such as the pencil of Apelles drew, “And Grecian virgins wore, in ancient days! “'Twas then the spirit of this nymph divine “Shone, to Electra's Bard, in golden dreams; “As oft he woo'd the favours of the Nine “Amidst the murmur of Ilyssus' streams. “But ah—how long—how heavily opprest “While Athens moulder'd into dust, she lay— “With Gothic darkness brooding o'er her breast, “That gloom'd the sweetness of her soul away! “If e'er the Bards of Arno's oliv'd vale “A wild note warbled to the pensive maid, “Full soon, unheeding the degenerate tale, “She fled, with many a sigh, from Pisa's shade. “Next, in her favourite isle, the harp she strung— “The British minstrels triumph'd, as she came— “Hail'd her—divine Simplicity; and sung “With all Aonia's harmony, her name. “Mark then her lovely form as pictur'd here “She gives to zephyr her Æolian shell; “And see that root-inwoven shrine, that near “Yon sycamore's broad shadow, crowns the dell. “Glares round its pedestal no quaint design; “Nor aught that meretricious art can boast: “To Nature rear'd, the unaspiring shrine “Appears, ‘while unadorn'd, adorn'd the most.’ “Lo there she bids, arrang'd with happiest taste, “The primrose and the violet sweet diffuse “Their mingled breath, and blend in union chaste “Their colours sprinkled by the twilight dews: “While my soft star, that loves, each evening hour, “To hover o'er the stillness of the dale, “Thro' the green sycamore, itself a bower, “On the rude altar, sheds a lustre pale. “No spicy clouds thence mingle with the skies; “Her humbler offering are yon' vernal wreaths: “And all the incense of her sacrifice, “Is but the incense that a field-flower breathes!” She spoke, and gave the picture to my care; And in the rich possession call'd me blest! And place it next thy heart (she cried) for there— “That heaving sigh already tells the rest! “Go then—where imitation's utmost art “Has faintly copied (tho' employ'd by me) “The bright original that fires thy heart, “Go—and the living form in Laura see!” OSSIAN DEPARTING TO HIS FATHERS. IMITATED FROM MACPHERSON'S OSSIAN, 1780. Where the dark torrent rolls o'er Lutha's vale, And from the rock the thistle's beard is driv'n, The floret trembles to the northern gale, Weary and cover'd with the drops of heaven. And “why, O gale, awake me?” (as it heaves Its sleepy head) it says, or seems to say; “The blast shall scatter all my fading leaves, “Ere Lutha's woody skirts are ting'd with day. “To-morrow shall the pensive traveller come, “Who in my bright attire remembers me; “O'er all the field his wishful eyes may roam, “But never more those eyes my place shall see.” So for the harp of Ossian shall, in vain, The hunter, at the dawn of morning, seek: “Where is the son of high Fingal? the strain “Sweet to my soul!” a tear shall wet his cheek. Here, as I cast my vagrant eyes around, On melancholy Lutha left alone, My voice is like the wind's last dying sound, When it forsakes the woods with feeble moan. The venerable oak its branches bends Over the gloomy stream; and, as it sighs Thro' all its hoary moss, the murmur blends With the rude whistling fern where Ossian lies. Yet not at distance I behold the day When I exclaim'd, “The joy of youth returns: “Son of the Rock, come listen to my lay, “With thoughts of other times my bosom burns. “So when the howling spirit of the north “Hath ceas'd the dark-red mountain to deform, “Amid the western sky the sun looks forth “In brightness from behind the broken storm. “Its dewy head each upland forest rears; “Fresh in the vale rejoices the blue stream; “The aged warriour on his staff appears, “And lo, his grey locks glitter in the beam.” Thus, with the glow of former years, I said; And, as the many-colour'd days of old Were mark'd with deeds of heroes, I survey'd The traces of the tales I once had told. I saw Cuthullin's car, the flame of death, As Swaran darken'd, like a roaring flood: I saw his high-maned coursers spurn the heath, Snort o'er the slain, and bathe their hoofs in blood. I saw, as midnight the wild wood o'ercast, Sudden the ghost of Crugal:—Hah! he stands Dim and in tears! “My spirit in the blast, (He faintly cries) “my corse on Erin's sands.” As reedy Lego's gale, his voice was shrill; Dark was his wound: his eyes, decaying flame: He stood, as the dun mist that robes the hill, And the stars twinkled thro' his shadowy frame. And Agandecca shone upon my sight, Fair as the moon slow-rising o'er the grove; Around her—beauty beaming as the light, Her steps were music, and her sigh was love. Alas! ev'n now I mourn the crimson tide, Her blue eyes fill'd with tears, her hair's soft flow; I see the red-brow'd Starno pierce her side; I see her falling like a wreath of snow. And I beheld the raven-tressed maid Who scorn'd, for Ossian's love, full many a chief; And, as I gaz'd upon her beauteous shade, Cherish'd, yet once again, the joy of grief. I saw the blooming youth of Fillan fall Amidst the strife of Erin's carnag'd field; While, in the stillness of his distant hall, The cold blood wander'd o'er his rifted shield. Then too I saw the warriour's helmet-plume Scatter'd and torn:—I heard him, as he spoke, “Ossian! with pity mark thy Fillan's doom, “I faint—O lay me in that hollow rock!” I saw Sulmalla trembling as the roe, When for her native lands she heav'd a sigh; And Cathmar musing on the virgin's woe, Her vagrant footsteps and her fearful eye. Where infant Carthon leapt with thoughtless joy, As the bright flame involv'd his father's halls, I saw in desolated silence lie The dreary ruin of Balclutha's walls. Once sweetly-soothing to my pensive soul, Such airy visions could my sighs awake: The soft-reflected forms on memory stole, Like moon-beams fading from a distant lake. And they were pleasant as the morning dew, That hangs, bright-clustering, on the hill of roes; Where the sun faintly spreads its orient hue, And the grey waters in the vale repose. Ev'n now the ghosts of passing Bards I hear, And catch their harpings as they glide along But cold, alas! is Ossian's closing ear; No more I listen to the sons of Song. Then, O Fingal, who dauntless in the fight Didst whirl thy falchion, like the lightning's sheet; And, as the tempest, raging in thy might, Bid the rocks burst in fragments at thy feet; Thou, who, at Loda, couldst proclaim aloud, (Eager the dismal spirit to withstand) His sword a meteor, and his shield a cloud, Tho' blasts were in the hollow of his hand; Tho' thunder was his voice, and flame his breath, His dreadful form bent forward from on high; His nostrils pouring pestilential death, As the pale nations vanish'd from his eye; Thou, who couldst bid thy Luno's massy blade Thro' the dark ghost its gleaming path disclose; While, as he shriek'd, the deep's still'd wave was stay'd, And, roll'd into himself, upon the winds he rose: Hear, glorious Chief, and ope thy vaulted hall; I come—yet harping shall I mix with air: Bear, O ye winds, my accents to Fingal, The voice of him, who prais'd the mighty, bear. The northern blasts, O king, thy gates unfold: Dimly in all thy arms I see thee gleam; Yet not as erst, the terror of the bold, Tho' by thy power the stormy meteors stream. There is a murmur on the heath—I hear The voice of high Fingal—that seems to say, (Long, long hath it been absent from mine ear) “Come to my halls, come Ossian, come away!” Tho' silent are the plains where battle rung, Yet in the four grey stones we rest our fame: In woody Selma hath our harp been strung, Tho' its tones vanish'd as the vapoury flame. “Come, Ossian, from thy Cona's desart vales! “Sail with thy sires, in clouds embosom'd deep, “O'er heaven!” I come; the life of Ossian fails: By Mora's dim stone I shall sink to sleep. The winds shall whistle to my earthy bed; And they may lift my wither'd tresses hoar: But Ossian cannot wake—his clay-cold head Is doom'd to feel the rustling blast no more. Yet shall my fame survive this feeble form, And, like the towering oak of Morven grow, Which proudly lifts its head to meet the storm, And waves in triumph o'er the wreck below! TO MRS. POLWHELE WRITTEN AT MANACCAN, 1794. The music of light-wafted sighs, The charm of accents ever kind, And, beaming from thy placid eyes, The radiance of a heaven-fraught mind; To glad this cot, from tumult far, Such are the harmonies of love— How sweet beneath yon gentle star Whose evening-lustre gilds the grove! Then, once again, I hail repose— Once more my happy home caress; If love, that unaffected flows, Can promise aught of happiness. Here, Mary! as the waving shade Shall whisper peace, each rural day; We own no joy by guilt allay'd, Nor care what others think or say. Yet, if we heed applause or blame, 'Tis but to make us doubly blest; While, as the praise thy merits claim, To envy we resign the rest. ON AN APPLE-TREE FULL OF BLOSSOM, SEPT. 11, 1798. TO OLIVIA MELIORA. Where, shivering thro' the leafy shade, September breathes a gloom; Lo yonder apple-tree array'd In all its vernal bloom. 'Twas gay Pomona bade it blow At Meliora's suit: Yet blooms that in September glow, Are like forbidden fruit. Then, Meliora! with thine hair These blossoms if thou weave; Alas, unweeting girl! beware The fate of mother Eve. TO OLIVIA MELIORA GATHERING HOP BLOSSOMS FOR HER HAIR, SEPT. 11, 1798. Lo, at the ball, with martial mien The sparks of every shop— To gaze upon the paly green That trembles in thy Hop! Yet, Meliora! in one pause Of calm reflection, stop; And, if thou can'st, my girl, shew cause Why life is not a Hop! The gay, at length, grow sick of soul, Or jilt, or flirt, or fop: So, oft, around the aspiring pole, We see the exhausted Hop. Amid the feast of life, we rue Full many a bitter sop: So those who love and those who brew Draw bitter from a Hop. And, whilst we flutter to and fro, 'Till fainting down we drop; Alas! we live and die, to shew That life is but a Hop! THE POOR SPARROW OF THE INFIRMARY, 1800. His fluttering prey, amid this dome Impetuous to pursue, Thro' the long airy-window'd room The bird of rapine flew. While scarce descried, on pinions fleet The tyrant glanc'd away; Affrighted, crouching at my feet, A feeble sparrow lay. Far off, the aërial murderer sail'd To scatter deadly fear But lo, the little trembler hail'd A sure asylum here. Thus, the dread minister of fate Intent his rage to wreak On human kind, to each retreat Pursues the faint and weak. Yet, if amidst these walls, perchance, He catch the patient's eyes; Scarce is he seen, with sudden glance, When off disarm'd he flies. What tho' he stretch the bloody fang? Here, here his threats are vain; The sick forgetting every pang— The wounded, every pain! THE SCARLET FEVER. SEPT. 1801. Whilst fever from the sultry east Effus'd her venom pale; Her raven “snuff'd the promis'd feast,” And croak'd in every gale. In yon low dell, where nigh the thatch The hops in clusters spread, I saw the unconscious victim stretch His little hands for aid; Or, vainly pant for zephyrs cool Within that steamy creek; Or there, beside the rush-green pool, Betray the burning cheek. I saw the maid, who sweetly bloom'd, Draw quick her poison'd breath; And those fine eyes, that love illum'd, For ever clos'd in death. Yet, “Here (I cried) this sloping hill “Hygeia! be thy care! “As freshness from the shade and rill “Shall fan the tainted air. “Here, as their tales my children lisp, “Or frolic down the green, “Shall fruits in acid ripeness crisp, “Inspirit every vein. “Here, Mary! never shall a sigh “Thy placid bosom move; “Nor e'er a languish dim thine eye, “Unless it be from—love!” Such was my strain. In soften'd shade The evening sunk away; As health with roses seem'd to braid The glimmering car of day. Alas! in fairy hopes like these, How impious to repose! Soon, dropping from his wing disease, The lurid morning rose. Blushing no longer as they blush'd A few short hours ago, I view my offspring fever-flusht, And shivering as they glow. Say, Mary! can I tell the rest? Alas! thy sickening charms! And clinging to thy scarlet breast Thy poor babe's feeble arms. Parent of all! Thou good Supreme! O mark my bended knee; The liveliest hope is all a dream, If uninspir'd by Thee. Father of Light! 'tis thine alone To pour the healing balm! Oh, as we fall before thy throne Our throbbing pulses calm. These innocents, great Sire of Life! Their mother—Oh, sustain! Yes! to my sighs restore my wife, Or all my prayers are vain! JANUARY 1, 1805. The years that are past, and can never return, In idea I fain would call back; But how faithless is Memory! In anger I spurn At her false, her dim-shadowy track. At length less obscure, my life's morning again Seems to open, with rays of relief— Yet oppos'd to the present, it gives me new pain; And my anger is chang'd into grief! ON LAWRENCE POLWHELE, WHO DIED AN INFANT, AUG. 10, 1805. Thro' the long night, my cradled child Drew quick his feeble breath; And vainly stretch'd his quivering arms Amidst the shade of death. The daystar rose: the redbreast pour'd A note to dawning day; His spirit, ere the note expir'd, Had pass'd, serene, away. And oh! it left in pale repose A smile upon his cheek: Thus, thro' the still cold gloom, I view'd The placid morning break. Dear Babe! that warbled strain I hear, Thy pensive requiem sweet; As, lifting up the coffin-lid, Those features mild I meet, And, plac'd in either lifeless palm, And, on thy breast, the flowers That fade so fast, and seem to say How short thine infant hours. But thou art spar'd full many a pang, Escap'd from sin and care: And ever shall a Saviour's love Such sainted children share. “Hail, with affection hail,” (he cries) “These spotless babes of Grace: “For lo! their angels e'er behold “In Heaven, my Father's face.” Thither I see the seraphs wings Earth's little strangers bear— Thee, Lawrence! child of innocence! Thine angel greets thee, there. EPISTLES. THE DISTAFF: AN EPISTLE. FROM THEOCRITUS. Friend to the woof, each thrifty matron's care, O thou, the azure-ey'd Minerva's meed, Thy poet's charge, to Nileus' towers repair, Where Cytherea's fane is bower'd in reed! Thither we ask fair winds to waft us o'er, That Nicias, by the sweet-ton'd Graces blest, (Their hallow'd offspring) may with letter'd lore And friendly converse charm his welcome guest. Thee, Distaff, thee, of polisht ivory fram'd I bear, meet present to his lovely wife: So shall her frugal industry be fam'd, The genuine model of domestic life; Whilst her fine vests shall manly limbs adorn, The flowing garment, or the robe succinct; While o'er her water'd webs by females worn Floats the rich lustre of the shadowy tinct. The fleece's treasure, each revolving year, Twice the shorn mother of the lamb supplies; For her who holds each toil—each science dear, That gains the stamp of merit from the wise. Nor would I bear thee, Distaff, to the dome, Where dissipation reigns, and idle mirth; Thee, who, amidst Sicilia's pasture-bloom, Tracest to Archias' city-walls thy birth. A happier mansion be thy lot to gain, Where lives my friend, whose health-restoring aid Lulls with salubrious balms the throbs of pain, And guards Miletus' sons from Pluto's shade. Thus shall thy fair possessor rise in fame, By thee recall to mind her tuneful guest; And many a-one, that marks thee, shall exclaim, ‘Tho' but a trivial favour be possest, ‘'Tis for the giver's sake the gift we boast, ‘And what a friend bestows we value most!’ EPISTLE TO DR. DOWNMAN OF EXETER. WRITTEN DURING A VIOLENT ILLNESS, AUGUST 17, 1791. Hail to my generous guide, my honour'd friend! May every blessing on his steps attend— How feebly the warm wish these lines impart! Yet, O accept them from a grateful heart! Here, Downman, as in still suspense I lie, And from my pillow lift the languid eye; 'Tis in thy friendship only, to effuse Some little spirit o'er my faultering Muse! Long have I own'd with pride, amidst the shade Of sacred poesy, thy critic aid; And, whilst thy lessons to perfection fir'd, The beauteous model in thy verse admir'd, Where melody unites with diction chaste, And all that fancy charms, or polisht taste. But merits, far superior, mark thy lays— Praise, such as this, were “mockery of praise.” The manly virtues in thy numbers shine, And sentiment, that nerves each vigorous line; And learning, not in pompous garb display'd, But in simplicity's pure vest array'd; And strong unbiast reason, and the light Of philanthropic feelings beaming bright: Nor less the humbler charities, that pour Their lustre on the dear domestic hour! Yet, tho' thy writings to the world hold forth A spotless mirror of thy active worth, Yet is thy life (just Heaven's peculiar care) But with a feeble ray reflected there. Strenuous to chase from man each brooding ill, Thy social kindness, or thy healing skill, Thro' all the tenour of that life appears, And brightens up a gloomy vale of tears; Whether, from opulence retir'd, thy feet Trace out the chill and comfortless retreat Of the poor orphan, or thou love to close The mental wounds that speak no common woes. Where, starting from a short and troubled sleep, The weary languish, or the wretched weep; 'Tis thine refreshing slumbers to restore, Bid strength revive, or sorrow weep no more. And, whilst the sounds of gratulation bless Thy healing art, thy merited success; Whilst, from the bed of sickness, round thee rise The rich, the poor, to meet thy glistening eyes, Fresh-blooming—with the nerve of health new-strung, And Downman echoes from each grateful tongue; Me, too, thy cordial balms already cheer, Thy friendly voice, thy sympathy sincere! Yes! where the last dim star of eve survey'd This fainting frame in pale disorder laid, When well nigh ceas'd the vital stream to flow, And every pulse beat tremulously low; And, as my breath seem'd ready to depart, Exhausted nature flutter'd at my heart; Thy medicine's renovating power could save My sunken spirit from the yawning grave! And O! if an indulgent Being give His servant, yet a few short years to live; To please that God who bless'd thy art in me, O Downman, may I live to copy thee! EPISTLE TO DR. DOWNMAN OF EXETER. WRITTEN AT MANACCAN, 1794. When the chaise, on a sudden, roll'd off from your door, And I thought in my heart I should see you no more, Since expression, dear doctor, was smother'd in silence; These lines I address to you, many a mile hence! A sabbath-day's journey, at least, had we rumbled, Ere a word to my wife or my children I grumbled: Nor could I my spirits a long while recover, Too fond beside Athelstan's palace to hover! The carriage indeed, as we reach'd Crockernwell, Had begun with its jostling my spleen to dispel, When we enter'd the inn by a porch of rude granite, Strong-pillar'd, whoe'er had the honour to plan it; Where a damsel, sunburnt as a haycock adust is, Said, ‘Business that morning was done by the justice:’ And the justice, I found, was our classic friend Hayter, At once a proficient in law and in metre; Tho' rarely, perhaps, the heroics of Greece Disturb the still brains of a justice-of-peace. Again fasten'd up, one and all, in the chaise, To remembrance I call'd our friend's elegant lays, And in fancy convers'd with my muse-loving comrade, While my features for joy, as I sat on my bum, ray'd: Nor had we far travell'd the rocky-rough road, Ere his verses suggested the thought of an ode; In which, as I painted druidical stones, And urns but half-bak'd, full of ashes and bones, I rais'd up my Britons, to fill with affright Pale Rome, amid all the scyth'd fury of fight. Thus wildly I bade the poetical war rage, High-cleaving the clouds, tho' coop'd up in a carriage! Yet oft from my real companions a squawl Brought me down in mid flight, as if shot by a ball! But before we arriv'd at the town on the Ock, I felt, my good Sir, a more terrible shock Than from squawling or squeaking, my Muse to unhinge, I felt from Podagra's hot pincers, a twinge; And begg'd my fond wife, with a visage of woe, To bind up in flannel my goutified toe! In the morning, however, I flung off the flannel, Limp'd forth, and awhile observ'd Ock's foamy channel; And then was cramm'd into a carriage afresh, Complaining of stiffness and heat in the flesh. From Ockinton, fam'd for its sweet little mutton, At length, with a pair of lame horses, we put on; Till, greatly exhausted, we view'd thy hoar ruin, Dunheved! as round thee a tempest was brewing; And, afterwards, saw the folks lounging at Bodmin, So sluggish, we christen'd them all, hodmandod-men; And, eastward of Truro, drove in, to survey The home where I frolick'd, when childhood was gay. But why, as no striking adventure befel, Of my route should I every particular tell? In short, then, my friend, like a timber-tree shaken, On the third day at eve I saluted Manaccan. And “Here, (I exclaim'd, as I enter'd my parlour) “Far off from the flatterer, far off from the snarler, “Secure from the blame or applause of the world, “Am I deep in the shade of obscurity hurl'd. “And this do I owe (so the bishop determines) “To my two most delectable volumes of sermons! “'Tis for these (but their merits are, sure, over-rated) “To my snug little vicarage I am collated: “And for a collation so pretty, from his shop, “I certainly am much oblig'd to the bishop!” Of my church I next day got the freehold, you see, By tolling the bell and by turning the key; And on Sunday I read myself in, to fatigue The largest assembly then met in Menege. Here, then, I'm set down in a building grotesque: But the scenery around is not unpicturesque. Of Helford you often have heard—in my parish— I assure you the niceness of Helford is rarish. All along on the harbour, the cottages rise To pleasure the poet's contemplative eyes! The fronts cherry-clad, and the roofs are so trim, That, when the full tide hath flow'd up to the brim Of the circular bason, we see quite a picture, Which holds at defiance all critical stricture. And, within, every board is so white, and each shelf So glitters with pewter, or glimmers with delf, The floors so well-sanded, the chimneys so neat, That I envy the villager such a retreat! On the steep-curving hill that hangs over the houses, An orchard here waves, and a heifer there browzes! Here a plough, as across the crag-furrows it bends, Perpendicular over a chimney impends! When, scaling the height, in the road to the church, We at once leave the low-buried cots in the lurch; Glance o'er an oak-wood, where the shrill-piercing cry Of the hawk often blends with the scream of the pie; And the labour of climbing the mountain-path, close, Out of breath, with the neat-looking farm of Halvoze, Whose owners are quickly expected (folks tell us) To spend here a part of the summer, from Hellas. Hence appear little fields of hay, fallow, or corn, That pollards of beech and bald oaklings adorn; And yellow furze gilding the extensive horizon, Fine food for an ass as you ever cast eyes on! If the country round you (as a writer avows) So full of rich meads, be fit only for cows; Since we beat you in furze, as you beat us in grasses, Our country, I'm sure, is fit only for asses! And yet, looking back, we observe from this height, The harbour, like silver, invested with light; And, darting our eyes from the boat-shadow'd tide To the coppice that crouds, on the opposite side, O'er the edge of the water, are pleas'd with each creek That varies the shore with a beautiful break. Nor should we the walk to the Dinas despise, Whence clustering hop-gardens solicit our eyes; And the smoke that ascends from the hamlet beneath, To curl thro' the clift in a light-azure wreath; And the hills far away, spotted over with sheep, And now, in full prospect, the surge of the deep! Meantime, from the glebe (which produces some pence— Full thirty good acres within a ring-fence) From the glebe, I would say, if we gaze all around, We, doubtless, may view much diversified ground: But chief are we charm'd, if the valley we mark That stretches away from beneath Coney-park; Here waving, so rich, a broad sycamore shade; There, opening at once in a golden-cup'd glade; Here catching attention, beside a dun hill, By a flash from the stream of an upper-shot mill; There leading the sight to a covert so privy, Thro' a long lane of elms hung with tremulous ivy; Here deepening, at distance, a thicket of holly Into gloom, to attract thy lone steps, Melancholy! And there, far retir'd, to a slanting sunbeam Disclosing, by sits, the dim source of its stream. And yet, my dear doctor, enclos'd by a wall, From the vicarage-house we see nothing at all: A part of the valley, indeed, so bewitching, We barely discern from the vicarage-kitchen. Here, here was I dropt—tho' but ill at my ease When I felt 'twas amid a cotillion of fleas! Such a hop tho' I never had witness'd before, Yet I voted the dance “an incredible bore.” But how a flea-ball could be held in my parlour, I could not divine, till I question'd a carle, here, Who said 'twas by pigeon-appointment, he heard— For the pigeons so mightily lov'd Mr. Peard, That, in bed or at board, to amuse the good man, sirs, They brought him a flock of these sweet little dancers. So, after ten years on a curacy past, It is this, my dear friend, to be vicar at last. Yet, tho' buried here in the fogs of the south, My heart, as I write, be quite up in my mouth, I trace, with fond pleasure, the years I have spent on The curacy, (lovely retirement!) of Kenton; Where I tun'd to my Laura sweet sonnets of love, And a wreath for the pupil of eloquence wove; Bade the lawns and the woodlands re-echo my strains Transferr'd to Devonia from Sicily's plains; And, uniting the poets of Cornwall and Devon, Prais'd them all with applauses untainted by leaven; And where, to involve the fair landscape in gloom, I consign'd my poor Laura's remains to the tomb. Still, doctor, I've reason to pluck up my spirits, When I think on my Mary's affection and merits: And, whilst I may look to the prospect of greeting, Now and then, the good friends from whose smiles I'm retreating, I should deem myself blest in so lovely a wife, E'en here at Manaccan—tho' hardly for life! SONNETS. FRIENDSHIP. FROM BION. IDYLL, IX. O blest are they who love, and are belov'd! Thus Theseus his Perithous' friendship knew; And, tho' amidst the infernal regions, drew Pure bliss from converse that exhaustless prov'd! Thus too Orestes, happy tho' he rov'd O'er Scythian desarts drear, had power to strew All on the barren waste where'er he mov'd Flowers of delight!—for Pylades was true, Ever the sweet companion of his way! And thus divine Æacides was blest, While his associate in the realms of day Remain'd; and tranquil to Elysian rest Patroclus flew—for his pale breathless clay Not unaveng'd the plain of carnage prest! TO THE EVENING STAR. FROM MOSCHUS. IDYLL. VII. Sweet Hesper, thou whose golden light (The sacred glory of the night) Illumes the deep-cerulean skies; Whose beams so dear to Venus rise; To whom the starry fires are pale As thou to silver Cynthia—hail! O guide me to my fair-one's feast: For lo, the lunar orb, decreas'd, Will quickly set: vouchsafe thy ray, To gild my solitary way. I go not, shelter'd by the shade, The nightly traveller to invade: 'Tis love impels! O Hesper, prove Sweet star, propitious to my love! THE REDBREASTS. Lorn Birds! whose simple minstrelsy, the last That nature pouring on the pensive ear, Bids echo back her vernal music past, And breathe a requiem o'er the closing year; Who, while the softest pity loves to steal From every cadence of your melting strain; Ah, who suspects such little breasts can feel Ungentle strife, or work each other pain? And yet, tho' seeming harmony of heart Flow in the sweetness of each charming note; Oft from the bitter fray ye bleeding part, Torn the stain'd plume, and pierc'd the vocal throat! Beneath the fairest aspect of disguise, Alas, too oft the cruel bosom lies! THE WOODCOCK. While not a wing of insect-being floats, And not a murmur moves the frozen air; Yon' ice-clad sedge, with tremulous wave, denotes, Amid the leafless copse, that life is there. And lo, half-seen, the bird of russet breast And duskier pinion, that had cleft the skies Of wild inhospitable climes, in quest Of the warm spring, his plamy labour plies. Feed on, poor bird, beneath the sheltering copse; And near thee may no wanton spaniel stray! Or rising, when dim eve her curtain drops, Ah! may no net arrest thy darkling way! But long unpent by frost, o'erflow the rill; And many an insect meet thy delving bill! TO A YOUNG LADY OF FOURTEEN. ON HER PRESENTING THE AUTHOR WITH A LOCK OF HER HAIR. 1790. Take, as I treasure, with a sigh, thy hair The tenderest wishes of affection take; Nor shall I blush to guard with partial care This auburn ringlet, for thy charming sake. Too soon its kindred tresses, where it grew, Tortur'd by all the tricks of varying dress, Must lose the brightness of their beauteous hue; Too soon must art their easy flow repress. Yet never may capricious fashion stain, My lovely girl! thy pure angelic mind; Never the young simplicity restrain, That sports, with sweet attraction, unconfin'd! So shall my Mary's gift, unchang'd by art, Be the dear emblem of her genuine heart! TO EMILIA. Forbear, my charming girl, forbear to grieve, Nor give the softness of thy soul to tears! No—rather triumph that his wrongs relieve Thy breast from wavering doubts and anxious fears. Tho' he whose vows deceiv'd thy gentle heart Bade thee from perjur'd lips the last adieu; Ere long, a kindred bosom shall impart Its soothing sighs to sweet Emilia true! For, trust the Muse, tho' the cold world may frown On those who cherish love's delicious sires; Yet are there some, who still unblushing own The nameless joys that sentiment inspires. And, where pure native sense and feeling join, That heart must beat in unison with thine. ADDREST TO TWO INGENIOUS YOUNG LADIES. Soften'd by shading verdure to display The rose's tints, in every tender fold; The mellow richness of the peach pourtray, Or paint the little warbler's plume of gold; To touch the bosom with each melting tone That music, in divine expression, pours; Such energies pure taste and feeling own, And such, my lovely Harmonists, are yours. 'Tis, then, in you, to grace the calm retreat, And bid perennial pleasures round you spring; Nor sigh the giddy multitude to meet, Where dissipation flits on airy wing: And they to whom domestic joys are dear, They only shine in woman's proper sphere. TO MISS S. WRITTEN IN MARCH 1792. While o'er thee Elegance, enamour'd, spreads Her airy vest with heaven's own tincture bright, Soft on thy cheeks the vernal blushes sheds, And radiates from thine eyes in lovely light; While in the sweetness of thy voice she owns Accents that from the trancing spheres she stole, And from thy harp elicits melting tones That speak the music of the pensive soul; While by thy glowing pencil she portrays Angelic shapes, that beam the types of thee— Regard the Muse who sighs in soften'd lays, Attracted by thy moral harmony, To each fine tone the trembling spirit gives, Breathes but to catch thy glance, and in thy essence lives! TO HIS INFANT MARIA. 1792. Ah! my dear Babe! thou smilest on the tear That hangs upon thy mother's fading cheek; Eager, as thou wert wont, her voice to hear— But her heart swells with grief, too full to speak. 'Tis for thy brothers, in the same cold bed, She weeps. O'er one the wintry storm hath past: And there, another rests his little head Fresh-pillow'd. But they feel not the keen blast! O'er their pale turf the whistling winds may sweep— Unconscious of the tempest, they repose: There, undisturb'd, sweet innocents! they sleep From human passions free, from human woes. Yes, dear Maria! they, my babe, are free From ills that wait, perhaps, in store for thee! TO A YOUNG LADY. When Death, with cruel stroke, dissolves the tye Which holds in friendship a congenial heart; We bid the long adieu with streaming eye, And pour the impassion'd sorrows ere we part. Yet, tho' we grieve, the inevitable ill, Ere long, with soften'd anguish we endure: For time the throbbing pulse hath power to still, And close the wound which reason could not cure. But if the averted look too plainly tell Constrain'd civilities from those we love; If all our warmth the frigid air repel, 'Tis ours (the wish sincere tho' heaven approve) A slow-consuming heart-ake to sustain, Whilst each cold look renews the sense of pain! ON A VISIT TO POLWHELE NEAR TRURO, WITH HIS CHILDREN, A SHORT TIME AFTER HIS FIRST WIFE'S DEATH. 1793. Ah! when so late I press'd this mossy sward In strains of hope I breath'd the melting lay!— For still the flatterer Hope vouchsaf'd a ray.— “If but a few short years kind Heaven award, “Here, here, my offspring may I duteous guard, “And guide them in the dark and doubtful way; “As Laura's heartfelt smile shall bid me brave “Each threat'ning ill, and every woe repay. “Then, as these arching shades around me wave, “May I sink down, in quiet, to the grave!”— Such was my strain.—But ah! my children, say, Where, where is fled—where vanisht Laura's smile? Alas! devoid of sorrow, as of guile, Ye little heed my tears, along the greensod, gay.” TO THE VICAR OF MANACCAN'S NUMEROUS PIGEONS, JUST AS THE AUTHOR WAS PREPARING TO SHOOT THEM. Poor Pigeons! by your quondam vicar priz'd, Tho' now condemn'd to fall, an easy mark To piece that's cock'd at random in the dark; Ye, to whose bursting crops is sacrific'd The glebe's fat produce; whether coney-park Or way-field, o'er whose waving grain the lark Chaunts his shrill orisons, the corn supply— Sweets birds! how ye salute the passer by, Dropping your oily burthens on his head! Alas! I cannot court you at my ease— Tho' softly billing, ye are full of fleas! Ah! ye may mourn, indeed, your patron dead— For lo! among you a most barbarous vicar Who cannot breathe till he has pull'd the trigger! A WINTER EVENING SCENE. MANACCAN, JANUARY 3, 1795. While, in the cold blue sky, the whitening moon Hangs like a fleece, and scarce across the deep, Whence it hath far emerg'd, a pale ray flings; Amid yon westering cloud the solar beam Descending, streaks the hamlet-trees that clothe The hill-top, with a line of liquid gold. Yet, ere the poet's eye can mark the scene, To the chaste lunar orb the waves reflect A placid lustre; and the cottage-clump Fades into darkness.—It is thus, in life: Joy, for a moment, lights one little spot, While sober melancholy, more diffus'd, Gleams with faint influence; till, the glory past, She comes confest, and the bright spot is gloom. TO THE AUTHOR'S MOTHER, DURING HER ILLNESS, 1797. “To rock the cradle of declining age,” Pope, was thy fervent wish! Nor, Hayley, less Thy glowing heart the filial prayer effus'd. Tho' at an humble distance I admire Your genius, may I rival, matchless pair! Your sacred piety; while now, from years Enfeebled, a much-valued parent claims My duteous care; while a kind sister calls To her assiduous “charity” that aid Fraternal, which can only soothe her grief, As she surveys the pallid eye that smil'd On us once playful innocents—the hand Tremulous, that led us up the steepy paths Of life—the fainting breast yet fraught with love! WRITTEN, DECEMBER 19, 1804; THE DAY OF HIS MOTHER'S BURIAL IN THE FAMILY VAULT AT ST. CLEMENT'S NEAR TRURO. Pale o'er my aged mother as I hung, Borne to her “narrow house,” a hurried look (As all my limbs with sudden tremour shook) Into the hollow vault of death I flung. But, as soft raindrops, dimpling the still brook Whose sands were troubled by a transient storm, So fell, in kind relief, tear after tear! For I descried the coffin that contains The dust of him to filial love so dear! And strait, me thought, I saw my father's form Beckoning my soul to yon celestial sphere, To hush this throbbing heart. Yet O, that near That coffin may be laid my cold remains, Tho' a poor earthly hope, is the hope trembling here! SONGS. CAPRICIOUS LOVE. FROM MOSCHUS. IDYLL. VI. Pan for his neighbour Echo sighs; She loves the dancing-Satyr: The Satyr, caught by Lyda's eyes, Is dying to be at her. As Echo fires the breast of Pan, Behold the dancer burn The nymph's soft heart—tho' Lyda's man: Thus each is scorch'd in turn. While all who slight are slighted too, They feel alternate pain: Then hear—‘Love those that fancy you, ‘And you'll be lov'd again.’ SONGS FOR THE HELSTON-FURRY FO 1796. JANUARY. Tho' oft we shiver'd to the gale That howl'd along the gloomy waste; Or mark'd, in billows wrapt, the sail That vainly struggled with the blast; Tho', as the dark wave flash'd on high, We view'd the form of danger near; While, as we caught the seaman's cry, Cold terror check'd the starting tear; Yet have we seen, where zephyrs breathe Their sweets o'er mead or pasture-down, Young laughing Spring with purple wreath The hoary head of Winter crown. But, ere we hail'd the budding tree Or all its opening bloom survey'd, Whilst in gay rounds the vernal bee Humm'd o'er the fragrance of the glade; Fled was the faery smile, and clos'd The little triumph of an hour: And Melancholy's eye repos'd On the pale bud, the fainting flower. APRIL. No longer the goddess of florets shall seem To rekindle the blooms of the year; Then scatter around us the wreck of a dream, And resign us to winter austere. To it promise yon delicate child of the shade— The primrose—is never untrue: Nor the lilac unfolds, the next moment to fade, Its clusters of beautiful blue. Tho' weak be its verdure, ere long shall the thorn The pride of its blossom display, Where Flora, amid the mild splendour of morn, Unbosoms the fragrance of May. THE EIGHTH OF MAY. Soft as the sigh of zephyr heaves The verdure of its lucid leaves, Yon opening lily's vestal white, Moist from the dew-drop, drinks the light. No more in feeble colours cold, The tulip, for each glowing fold So richly wav'd with vermeil dyes, Steals the pure blush of orient skies. The hyacinth, whose pallid hue Shrunk from the blast that Eurus blew, Now trusts to May's delicious calm Its tender tint, its musky balm. And hark! the plumed warblers pour Their notes, to greet the genial hour, As, whispering love, this arborous shade Sports with the sunbeam down the glade. Then say, ye nymphs! and truly tell, If ever with the lily's bell, Or with the tulip's radiant dye Young poets give your cheeks to vie; Or to the hyacinth compare The clustering softness of your hair; If e'er they bid your vocal strain In silence hush the feather'd train; Beat not your hearts with more delight At every “rural sound and sight,” Than at such flattery, to the ear Tho' syren-sweet, yet insincere? THE FADE White-vestur'd, ye maidens of Ellas, draw near, And honour the rites of the day: 'Tis the fairest that shines in the round of the year; Then hail the bright Goddess of May. O come, let us rifle the hedges, and crown Our heads with gay garlands of sweets: And, when we return to the shouts of the town, Let us weave the light dance thro' the streets. Flinging open each door, let us enter and frisk, Tho' the master be all in a pother— For, away from one house as we merrily whisk, We will fadè it, quick thro' another. The nymph who despises the furry day-dance, Is a fine, or a finical lady— Then let us with hearts full of pleasure, advance, And mix, one and all, in the Fadè! THE SOLITARY FAIR. Perhaps, fair maid! thy musing mind, Little to festive scenes inclin'd, Scorns not the dancer's merry mood, But only longs for solitude. Thy heart, alive to nature's power, Flutters within the roseate bower, Thrills with new warmth, it knows not why, And steals delirium from a sigh. Alas! tho' so averse from glee, This genial hour is felt by thee: The tumults of thy bosom prove, That May is but the nurse of—love! BEWARE OF THE MONTH OF MAY. Then, gentle maid, whoe'er thou art, Who bid'st the shades embowering, veil The sorrows of a lovesick heart, And listen to thy pensive tale; Sweet girl! insidious May beware; And heed thy poet's warning song: Lo! May and Venus spread the snare For those who fly the festal throng! SIGHING SUSAN. Poor Susan cries: “About my breast “There's something, oh! so tight— “I sigh all day, as one distrest, “And often sigh at night. “A sigh (my neighbours say) to glee “Was always thought a foe: “But there is something sweet, good me! “At least in sighing so! “They ask me, for what cause so oft “I labour with a sigh? ‘Is it, because your heart is soft?’ “I'm sure, I can't tell, why. “Yet father says—he knows full well— ‘But go, you'll like the task; ‘Ask William—he, perhaps, may tell’— “I think, I'll go, and ask.” END OF THIRD VOLUME.</field>
