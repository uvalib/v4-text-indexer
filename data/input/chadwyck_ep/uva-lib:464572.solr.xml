[A FRAGMENT.] I ceste liuere est escrit la estorie del Euangelie en engleis solum ceo ke ele est escrit en latin, et continue de la Anunciacion nostre seignour Ihesu crist. De la Natiuite benette. De sa Passi?n. De sa Resurexion. De sa Ascension e de sa Glorificacion. Et de soun Auenement a Jugement et de nostre presentement en cors en alme. Sum-while ich was wiþ sunne i-bounde, And sunne me hath icast to grounde; Bote, swete Ihesu, þi swete woundus Leesed me haþ of harde stoundus. Whon I to þe tornde my þouht, Pynes to þole ne greueþ me nouht; Þy Deþ me haueþ of serwe i-brouht And loue to þe in me haþ wrouht. Þe to loue is al my blisse, Me longeþ sore þi woundus to kisse. Swete Ihesu, my þouht þou wisse, On þe to þenche þat I ne misse. ffole þouhtes me were woned to tille, ffeole tymes to don ille, In word, In dede, In wikked wille, Niht and Day, al me to spille: Bote whon I me vndurstod Þat þou for me scheddest þi blod, ffolye to leue me þhouhte good And to þe, Ihesu, I tornde my mood. Bote ?it I me bi-gon to drede Þat he þat eggeþ mon to quede Wiþ sunfol þouht me wolde lede To wikked wille or fool dede. Þerfore my þouht on þe i feste; ffor þer i wot to fynden reste— Of vche loue þou art þe beste, Þou art þe loue þat euere wol leste. Nis no mon, Ihesu, bote in þe In whom bi-houeþ us I-borwed be. Þi loue to winne, i wolde fonde, ?if I me mihte wel vndurstonde, Sum þing of þe to write and rede, Þer-þorwh of þe to winnen mede. And heo þat scholden hit iheren, Of þe Gospel mowe sumwhat leren Þat writen is þer-Inne of þe, On Englisch tonge þorwh swynk of me. Wyse men bi Olde dawes Bokes made of goode lawes, Hou me scholde hem wiþ rihte leden And wys to ben in alle heor deden; And þei no-þing ne wusten of þe, But goddus heo maden of ston and tre, And þing þat ne mihte seo ne here ffor God heo honourede and heolde dere: Sonne and Mone, Day and Niht, Sterre and al þat ?iueþ lyht, Þat Goddus weren alle þei wenden, And God of heuene no-þing ne kenden. Of grete Clerkes also we fynde Þat Bokes made of Beestes kynde, Of ffoul, of Ston, of Gras, of Treo, And al for Mon þeron to seo, Solace to haue and techinge, And hem to holde from fool lykynge— ffor whose hereþ of Beestes kynde Mony wondrus he may þer fynde, ffeole þinges seon and here Wher-þorwh he may him-self lere Hys lyf to lede wiþ more wynne, Good to do and haty?e synne. A wys mon seiþ þat bestes weren, Hert and Eddre, þeos þreo, and Ern, Þat heore lyf chaungede þorwh here kynde— ffor þus of hem I-write we fynde: Þat kuynde ?ifþ vche mon eggynge, Of vche good þing haue ?eornyng. Bote beter þyng ne mai no mon fynde Þan þe, lord of alle þynge, Þat Beest and ffoul and alle wiht At wille beoþ vndur Monnes miht.— Ihesu louerd, þi loue to wynne ?if me grace to bi-gynne, Loue me sende to fordo synne, Þat al monkynde was bounden Inne. Ar Godus sone in þe Maiden alyhte, A?eyn þe deuel we nedde no mihte; ffor we weren vndur his mihte, Of good to don we loren þe sihte. Þat tyme was sunne so ryf, In Old, In ?ong, In Mon, In Wyf: As sone as heo laften þe lyf, To helle heo wenden wiþ-outen stryf. Habraham, Ysaak, and seint Ion, Dauid þe kyng, and Salamon, Þidere heo wenden, euerichon,— Heo nedden þo no beter won. fforte Godus sone was don on Rode, Þidere wente wikkede and goode, Þe wikkede to pyne, wiþ dreri mode, Þere to beo þe deueles foode; Bote þulke soules swete Þat here on lyue heore synnes leete, In freo prisun þenne was heore sete, To abyde þe biheste of þe prophete. Prophetes weren I-woned to grede: “Ow schal comen wiþ-oute drede Þat flesch schal taken in Maydenhede And us to Ioye of pyne lede.” Whon God of heuene herde þis cry, Of Monkynde he hedde mercy: And ches a Mayde of gret ferly, Clene in soule and in body. To hire he sende a swete fere, Þat him was swiþe leof and dere: Gabriel, wiþ swete chere, And hire gon grete on þis manere: Heil, ful of grace, God is wiþ þe, A-Mong wymmen I-blessed þou be!” Þe Maide was dred on him to seo, And þouhte what þis mihte beo. Þenne him spac þe Aungel fre: “Marie, nouht ne dreed þou þe! A child schal beo boren of þe, Iesus schal his nome be. He schal þe ffader of heuene qweme, In Dauid sete sitte and deeme, Þe folk of Israel he schal ?eme And heore fon from hem fleme.” Þenne onswerde þat swete Mayde To þe Aungel Gabriel and sayde: “Hou schal þis be? nou?wher I ne leide Mi þouht to luste of mon vpbreide.” Þen þe Aungel hire herte dihte, And of þis gretynge hedde in-sihte: “Þe holy gost (he seide) schal in þe alihte And in þe worche wiþ his mihte. Þe chyld þat of þe schal beo bore, Godus sone he schal beon i-core; He schal þe folk, þat herbi-fore, To blisse bringe, þat heo hedden forlore. And þat þou þe soþe lere, Þi nece Eli?abeþ, lo here, Þit is in elde feole ?ere, Heo haþ chyld take of hire feere. Þe sixte Moneþ now is anon Þat heo haþ wiþ chylde igon— ffor to God of heuene, þat is on, Nis word of vnmihte non.” Nolde Marie no lengore plede, Þis wordes in hire herte heo sede: “Lo me her Godus Mayde, Wiþ me do God as þou hast sayde!” As sone as þis was in hire þouht, In hire was Monnes kuynde i-wrouht And soþfast God was þerto i-brouht— Mon, þer-of ne dred þe nouht! Þe Aungel Marie God bi-kende And to him eode þat him sende. And sone aftur þat mayde wende To Eli?abeþ, hire kuynde frende. Sone so þe Mayde Marie Entrede þe hous of ?akarie, Eli?abeth In prophecie Þe Maide custe and þus gon crie: “A,” heo seide, “how may þis be Þat my lordus modur comeþ to me? As sone as ich herde þe steuene of þe, Þe Child in my wombe makede gle. A-Mong wymmen I-blessed þou be, And blessed beo þe fruyt of þe!” Þer bilafte þat swete may Wiþ Eli?abeth wel moni a day— Ne louede heo no foles play, Bote louede God and þonked ay. Þenne þer was a swete metynge, Swete cluppinge and swete cussynge! A Mayde þat bar þe lord of alle þinge, A wyf þat bar seint Ion in holy weddinge! Þis was seynt Ion for whom bi-fore His ffader hedde his speche for-lore, And to þe tyme þat he was bore, As þe Aungel seide bi-fore. ?akarie was his ffadre name; Gret mon he was and of good fame. Tyme com of þe seruyse, Þat he don scholde in heore wyse: In þe temple he saih vp rise Bifore him a mon, and him gon agrise. Hit was an Aungel, Godes sonde, Þat gon at þe Auter stonde, And ?akarie he com to fonde, Don his seruyse bad him not wonde. “?akarie,” he seide, “ne dred þou nouht! Bifore God þi bone is wrouht; Þat þou hast him bi-souht, Schal in Eli?abeth ben i-wrouht: A child þou schalt on hire winne, Þat schal ben Ioye to al his kinne, I-blessed he beo hire wiþ-Inne; Ion he schal hote, clansere of sinne. At his Burth-tyme me schal gamen &amp; pleye: He schal greiþen godus weye, To þe folk he schal soþ seye And mis-bileue he schal doun leye.” ?akarie onswerde wiþ dreri chere: “Hou may þis ben on eny manere? Boþe we beþ olde, ich and my fere, And forþ igon in feole ?ere.” Þe Aungel seide: “Þis schalt þou se. And for þat þou leuest not me, Þou schalt beo Doumbe, ich sigge þe, fforte þat child ibore be.” Þe Aungel bi-lafte no lengore þore, Ne ?akarie ne spac no more, Bote out he eode, sikynge sore— Þe folk hedde wondur wherfore hit wore. Bote heo seiden alle by-dene Þat he haþ sum wondur i-sene Þat he so longe haþ i-bene In þe temple, as we wene. ?akarie þenne dude his dede, Nout for his fleschliche nede, But child to wynnen, ?if he miht spede, And so of God to wynne meede. Þat swete couple at þat metynge Of ffleschliche lust hedde no lykynge, Bote holy wille and swete egginge To Godus seruyse chyld forþ bringe. A child he won þorwh godus mihte, Þorwh Godus heste, and hedde insihte: In Eli?abeth þe holigost lihte And þat child in hire dihte. Eli?abeth ful glad was þo Þat heo gon wiþ chylde go! A-wey heo let al hire wo Þat heo hedde fourti ?er and mo.— Whon þat child scholde iboren be, His frendes aboute of þe cuntre Wiþ blisful chere, gamen and gle Alle he comen þe child to se. Þenne seiden his frendes alle ?akarie heo wolden him calle. Þat herde þe Modur, þer heo lay, And onswerde and seide: “nay, “Mi leue frendes, doþ a-way! Ion he schal hote, ?if I may.” Alle heo seiden þat þer nas non In al heore kynde þat hihte Ion. To ?akarie þe word heo brouhte And bad him sigge what he þouhte. And he a table sone souhte And þeron þe nome wrouhte. On þe tablet he wrot anon Þe childes nome, he wrot Ion— “God bi-fore he schal gon And to him torne mony on.” Wondur hedde þo al his kynde Hou he mihte þis nome fynde. Bote God his tonge let vnbynde; And he him louede wiþ al his Mynde. “God,” he seide, “i-blessed þou be, Þat of his folk wolde haue pite, And his Merci haþ i-sent to me, Þat þis child schulde i-bore be! And þou, child, schalt ben clept prophete, Þou schalt greiþe godus strete, Godus folk þou schalt . . gete And hem teche heor sunnes bete. Þis speche to godus folk Þou schalt preche, Þou hem schalt þe soþe teche Hou heo schulle to heuene reche.” Also as ich er seyde, þe Maide Marie Hire lyf ladde wiþ-oute folye Wiþ Eli?abeth and hire cumpaygnye. Wiþ hem þenne was heo þore Þreo Moneþes, oþur more, Wiþ-outen sunne, wiþ-outen sore— Heo louede god, þat was hire lore. As seiþ þe holy mon seint Bede: ffrom hire nece nout heo ne eode Ar heo say fulliche in dede Eli?abeth seint Ion fede.— Þenne heo þonked god, ful of blisse, Þat he wolde seo hire mekenesse And hire a sone sende in swetnesse, To taken in hire monnes liknesse. “Þerfore me schal al Monkynde Blisful telle in heore mynde, Þat he wolde in me Mekenesse fynde, Þat mihtful in to lame and blynde. Of Merci he was leche ffrom kynde þat dredde his speche. Of þe proude of herte he dude wreche, And dude þe Meke an hei? to reche; Þe hungri in god he made stronge, And þe riche he lette al swonge. Þe folk of Israel haþ vndurfonge Þe child þat heo abide longe; Also him spac þe heuene kyng To Abraham and his ofspring.” Whon Marie hedde i-se?e þe dede Of þe child and al þe neode, Þe Mayden hire bi-gon to spede And leue tok and hom heo eode. Whon heo com hom, Iosep to queme Þat als his spouse hire hedde to ?eme, In his herte he gon hire deme, Hou heo mihte wiþ childe seme. Whar-of hit were, noþing he nuste, So as he neuere hire Mouþ custe Mid wille of sunne, ne neuer luste Hire Maidenhod fulliche vpbreste. And for in him nas no falshede, In word ne in þouht ne in dede, In his herte nas no drede Þauh heo hedde ilore hire Maydenhede. And for he neuere ne sai? wiþ ei?e Þat heo to fool dede gon hire bey?e, Loth him was on hire to ly?e, Of fleschliche dede hire be-wrye. ffor wel he wuste, nas þer no speche, Þorwh þe lawe of spousbruche, Bote hire þe domesmon bi-teche, Sone of hire to take wreche. A?e þe lawe him lyked ille Þat me scholde a Mayde spille. ffor-þi bi-fel hit in his wille Þat Mayde lete and leuen hire stille.

[hou þe cite off croteye was delyuered of þeir enemys by vre lady coote.] Lordus, ?if ?e wol lusten to me, Of Croteye, þe noble Cite, ffurst hou hit bi-seget was And seþþen dilyueret þorw godus gras And þorw þe help of vre ladi, So witnesseþ Miracle of Mari. Out of peihtes lond þer came A kniht þat Rollo was his name; He gederet wiþ him out of þe north Cost Of diuerse nacions a wel gret host, Out of Denemarch and North-wey, Of feolore folk þen I con sey. Mony Cuntres he can destruye, Wel muchel pepule he gan anuye, In mony a Coost, bi Est and West, He won him londes bi Conquest. ffurst he bi-gon in þe North Cuntre, And aftur he schipet ouer þe Séé. Sire Rollo wiþ al his host Ariuede in ffraunce vp in a cost. Þat Cuntre gon he furst destrui?e, Þerfore he called hit Northmondye, ffor þei dude men to deþe i-lome Þat out of þe North cost come; Þerfore he called hit Northmondye, As writen I fynde in his storye: Of Bruit þe Cronicle witnesset wel Þis Conquest of Rollo eueridel. Hit was þe furste Duik in þat lond, ffor he furst won hit wiþ his hond. Whon Rollo þat kniht was þider I-comen And mony a toun þei hedde I-nomen, Mony a Mon þei dude to deþe, fful fewe þei saueden, and ?it vnneþe. And as he trauayled on his Iorney, He com to a Citéé, was called Crotey. Þus sone Sire Rollo wiþ his Route Bi-sette þat Citéé wiþ sege a-boute. Wiþ-Inne þe Citéé men hedde gret drede: Heore Enemys weren so douhti of dede; Of socour þei se?en non oþur won But ?elden þe Cite, or elles ben slon. An holi Bisschop þer was þer-Inne, Þat was called sire Waltelinne, He was Bisschop of þat Citéé, A swuyþe noble mon was he. He tauhte heom ?erne knele and crie To crist and to his Modur Marie; Þorw help of hire þat bar vr lord He hopede þei schulden han sone cumfort. Seþen him-self goþ to þe Sextri?e, Þat was þe Munstres treserye; Vr ladi Curtel þer-Inne he found. Wiþ gret Reuerence he kneled to ground, Þer to Marie he beed his bone To sende þat Cite socour sone. Wiþ peple and gret processioun He bar þat Relyk þorw al þe toun, fful deyntely diht vppon a spere, As lordus Baner displayet in werre. Þe Bisschop heet cast vp þe ?ate And bad his folk folewe hym algate, Him-self bi-foren and þei be-hynde; He hoped in Marie help to fynde. A-non as þei were þus out went, Heore enemys letten hem not but schent: ffor so a-stoneyd and ferede men Nere neuer worse þen þei were þen! Whon on þat relyk þei caste heore siht, Þei woxe start-blynde anon-riht; Þei mihten no more defenden heom þen Þen so mony blynde or drounkene Men.

And do we on þe same wyse Boþe glade and bliþe wiþ bisy seruise, Þe same ladi forte qweme, Þat so in Mischeef to vs takeþ ?eme To hire sone crist vre erende to bede, And socoureþ vs so at eueri nede. Nou, ladi, preye þi sone on hih To alle cristene he graunte Merci! Amen. II. [hou þe Iewes, in despit of vre lady, þrewe a chyld in a gonge.] Wose loueþ wel vre ladi, Heo wol quiten his wille wel whi, Oþur in his lyf or at his ende: Þe ladi is so freo and hende. Hit fel [so] sum-tyme in Parys, As witnesseþ in holy writ Storys. In þe Cite bi-fel þis cas: A pore child was of porchas, Þat wiþ þe Beggeri þat he con wynne He fond sumdel what of his kinne, His ffader, his Moder, and eke him-self; He begged in Cite bi eueri half. Þe child non oþur Craftus couþe But winne his lyflode wiþ his Mouþe. Þe Childes vois was swete and cler, Men lusted his song wiþ riht good cher; Wiþ his song þat was ful swete He gat Mete from strete to strete. Men herked his song ful likyngly: Hit was an Antimne of vre lady, He song þat Antimne eueri-wher, I-Called Alma Redemptoris Mater, Þat is forþrihtly to mene: “Godus Moder, Mylde and Clene, Heuene ?ate and Sterre of se, Saue þi peple from synne and we.” Þat song was holden deynteous, Þe child song hit from hous to hous. ffor he song hit so lykynglye, Þe Iewes hedde alle to hym Envye. Til hit fel on a seters-day Þe Childes wey þorw þe Iewerie lay: Þe Iewes hedden þat song in hayn, Þerfore þei schope þe child be slayn. So lykingly þe Child song þer, So lustily song he neuer er. On of þe Iewes Malicious Tilled þe child in to his hous; His Malice þere he gan to kuyþe: He Cutte þe childes þrote alswiþe. Þe child ne spared nout for þat wrong, But neuer-þe-latere song forþ his song; Whon he hedde endet, he eft bi-gon, His syngyng couþe stoppe no mon. Þer-of þe Ieuh was sore anuyet. Leste his Malice mihte ben aspyet, Þe Ieuh bi-þouhte him of a gynne: In to a gonge-put fer wiþ-Inne Þe child adoun þer-Inne he þrong. Þe child song euere þe same song; So lustily þe child con crie, Þat song he neuer er so hy?e: Men mihte him here fer and neer, Þe Childes vois was so hei? and cleer. Þe Childes moder was wont to a-byde Euery day til þe Non-tyde, Þen was he wont to bringe heom mete, Such as he mihte wiþ his song gete. Bote þat day was þe tyme a-past. Þerfore his Moder was sore a-gast; Wiþ syk and serwe in eueri strete Heo souhte wher heo mihte wiþ him mete. Bote whon heo com in to þe Iewery, Heo herde his vois so cler of cry. Aftur þat vois his Modur dreuh: Wher he was Inne, þerbi heo kneuh. Þen of hire child heo asked a siht. Þe Iew wiþ-nayted him anon-riht, And seide þer nas non such child þrinne. Þe childes Moder ?it nolde not blinne, But euer þe Moder criede in on. Þe Ieuh seide euere þer nas such non. Þen seide þe wommon: “þou seist wrong, He is her-Inne, I knowe his song.” Þe Ieuh bi-gon to stare and swere And seide þer com non such child þere. But neuer-þe-latere men mihte here Þe child song euere so loude and clere, And euer þe lengor, herre and herre, Men mihte him here boþe fer and nerre. Þe Modur coude non oþur won: To Meir and Baylyfs heo is gon, Heo pleyneþ þe Ieuh haþ don hire wrong To stelen hire sone so for his song; Heo preyeþ to don hire lawe and riht, Hire sone don come bi-fore heore siht, Heo preyeþ þe Meir par Charite Of him to haue freo lyuere. Þenne heo telleþ þe Meir a-Mong Hou heo lyueþ bi hire sone song. Þe Meir þen haþ of hire pite, And sumneþ þe folk of þat Cite. He telleþ hem of þat wommons sawe, And seiþ he mot don hire þe lawe, And hoteþ hem wiþ hym to wende, To Bringe þis wommons cause to ende. Whon þei cum þider, for al heore noyse Anon þei herde þe childes voyse, Riht as an Angeles vois hit were, Þei herde him neuer synge so clere. Þer þe Meir makeþ entre, And of þe child he askeþ lyuere. Þe Ieuh may nou?t þe Meir refuse, Ne of þe child hym wel excuse, But nede he moste knouleche his wrong, A-teynt bi þe childes song. Þe Meir let serchen hym, so longe, Til he was founden in þe gonge, fful depe I-drouned in fulþe of fen.

Sum-tyme fel in on Cite— Herkneþ wel, and ?e may here— As Iewes weren I-wont to be Among þe cristen and wone I-fere: Þe Cristene woneden in On halue Of þat Cite, as I þe hete, And alle þe Iewes bi hem-selue Were stihlet to wone in a strete. Þe Cristene children in a Crofte I-mad hem hedden a wel feir plas. Þer-Inne a Iewes child ful ofte Wiþ hem to pleyen I-wont he was. Þe childes ffader nom non hede, Ne to his child he sette non ei?e, Þerfore þe child boþe com and eode As ofte as euere hem luste to pleye. So ofte to pleyen hem fel i-fere Þe Iewes sone on heore pleyes coude, Þat riht as on of hem he were; Wiþ loue þerfore þei him alouwede. At an Aster tyme bi-tidde, Whon cristen made solempnite— A Menskful Munstre was mad amidde, As semed best, in þat Citéé: Þerto þe cristene peple can drawe, To here boþe Mateyns and eke Masse, As falleþ bi þe Cristene lawe Boþe to more and eke to lasse; Eueri mon in his array, Boþe housbonde and wyf also, As falleþ wel for asterday And al as cristene men schul do. Þe children foleweden heore fadres in-fere, As þei weore euere I-wont to do. Þe Iewes child wiþ wel good chere Wiþ hem wel fayn was for to go. Wiþ-Inne þe chirche whon he was Riht, Him þouhte he nas neuer er so glad As he was of þat semeli siht, Such on bi-fore neuer se?e he had: Boþe laumpes &amp; tapers, brenninde briht, And Auters curiousliche de-peynt, IMages ful deinteousliche i-diht, And guld of moni a good corseynt. A comeli qween in O Chayer fful semeli sat, al greiþed in golde, A blisful Babe on Arm heo beer, fful kyngly Corouned, as he scholde. Of þat ladi þe child tok hede, And of þat blisful Babe also, Hou folk bi-foren heore bedes bede, As cristen Men beþ wont to do. Þe Iewes child euere tok such ?eme To alle sihtes þat he þer sei?, Him þhou?te hem alle so swete to seme ffor Ioye him þou?te I-Rauessched neih. Whon hei?-Masse of þat day was do, Þe Prest bad alle men knelen a-doun: Wiþ Confiteor, as falleþ þer-to, He ?iueþ hem Absolucioun; He biddeþ hem More and lasse also, To vengen heor sauiour busken hem boun. Þe Iewes child tok tente þer-to, Among þe cristene he dude him doun. AMong þe pres þauh he were poselet, He spared no-þing for no drede AMong þe cristene til he were hoselet; Of such a child me tok non hede. To ende whon alle þing was brouht And eueri cristene drouh him hom, Þe Ieuh þorw toune his child haþ souht, And saih wher he from chirche com. He asked his sone wher he hedde ben, Whil he hedde souht him al þat day. Al riht as he hedde i-don and seon, Þe child him rikenet al þe a-Ray. His ffader þerfore wox wood-wroþ, And seide anon: “þou getest þi mede!” And to his houene al hot he goþ, Þat glemede as glowyng as a glede. In to þe houene þe child he caste: To askes he þou?te þe child to brenne; And wiþ þe Mouþ-ston he stekeþ him faste, And þouhte þat neuer couþ scholde him kenne. Þerof whon his moder herde, In a stude þer as heo stood, As ffrayed in ffrenesye heo ferde, ffor wo heo wente as waxen wood, Euer hotyng out, heo tar hire her, In eueri stret of þat Citee, Nou In, Nou out, so eueriwher; Men wondret on hire and hedde pite.

Þe child sat þere boþe hol and sound, Ne nouht I-harmet, hond ny her, A-Midde þe gledes of þe ground, As he seete in Cool Erber. Þe childes Moder, whon heo þat seih, Hire þouhte heo nas neuer er so glad; In to þe houene heo sturte him neih, Þus sone wiþ hire him out heo had. And al þe peple þere present Wondred on þat selly siht, And heried god wiþ good entent, ffor Miracle is more þen Monnes miht.

Þe Meir sat on þe Ieuh him-selue, fforte beo Iuge of his trespas; To siggen þe soþe i-sworen were twelue, To ?iuen heore verdyt in þat caas. Þei counseiled i-vere vppon þat caas, And comen a?eyn bi on assent; Þe wordes of þat verdyt was: “In þat same houene he schulde be brent.” Þus is endet þis stori Of þe Miracle I-writen a-boue.

[Of a prest þat lay by a nonne.] In Bok we fynde, as we Rede, Of a preest, was wylde of dede, Þat was I-wounde in mony a vice, But at þe laste he was not nyce And to synne so wel dude wone Þat wiþ a Nonne he hedde to done. Þerof wolde he him not schryue Til þat he schulde lete þe lyue. ?it he serued vre Ladi Day bi day ful specialy, Matyns and vres day Bi day Of hire he seide wiþ-oute delay. At þe laste he fel seek, And schulde be ded as we schulen ek. Vr ladi þat he hedde in Reuerence Wolde he schulde clanse his Concience, And þat hym fel riht wel in Mynde, A trusti frend ?if he mihte fynde. A prest þer was he louede wel, He tolde his lyf to Eueridel; He sykede sore and criede Merci Þat god schulde on him haue pite forþi, And for his synnes was sori. He preyed þe prest ful feiþfuli Þat, as þei hedden be felawes long, He schulde þenken on him a-mong His Masse and his Almes-dede, Þat God mihte quite hym his Mede And þat his soule þat was vngeyne Þe sannore mihte passe out of peyne. Þat oþer, þat he wolde, he seide. After he dy?ede, In eorþe was leyde. Þe prest forsoþe for-?at hym nouht, But euere hedde hym in his þouht, Al þat ?eer, day Bi day, He song his Masse, as I ow say, Þat O day he song of vre Ladi, Þat oþer of Requiem, sikerli. Al þe ?er þis Charge he nom. Atte laste his Mynde-day com. As he stod at his Masse þo, After þe sacryng In Memento, He sauh stonden him bi-fore Þe ffeireste ladi þat euere was bore, Vppon þe Auter þer he stod. Heo seide to him wiþ Mylde Mod: “Þou hast me trauaylet wiþ þi preyere, Now at þis tyme to ben here. As þou hast preyed in þi Messe, I haue geten for?iuenesse To þi felawe of my sone dere Of al þat euere he mis-dude here; Of his peyne he is releset, And his Ioye schal ben encreset; Lo wher he kneleþ þe bi-hynde: To ben I-hoselet he haþ in Mynde.” Þe prest torned hym softely And sauh him knele faste by; Anon wiþ godes Bodi Hoselde him deuoutli. Þen sauh þe prest vr ladi þer Come a-doun of þat Auter And take his felawe bi þe honde, Out of þe Chirche forte fonde. Of þis siht he was ful fayn, And tornede to his Masse a-?ayn; Þerof þenne he made an ende, Preyed god grace him to sende Þorw preyere of his Moder dere, So to lyuen and to don here, After þis world þat is al wast To haue þe blisse þat euer schal last.— Wel are we holden day and niht Worschipen hire wiþ al vr miht Þat euer is so redi diht To bringen vs alle to heuene-liht. And þat hit mote so be, Seyeþ to hire an Aue! VIII. [hou vre lady ?af mylk off heore pappes to a man þat hadde þe squynacye.] A mon of gret deuociun Was sum-tyme in Religiun, Þe Bok seiþ he was a Monk, And in godes seruise swonk; To vr ladi he was deuout, Hire to serue euer was a-bout. Whon he herde of hire eny speche, Of al his dissese þat was his leche, Þat hedde he leuere þen drinke or ete, ffor Ioye þe teres wolde he lete. Of oþer þinges rouht he nouht, So swete on hire was his þouht. Þat tyme riht as men doþ floures Men gederede furst Matines and vres Þat men vsen now of vre ladi, And seiden hem deuoutly; Whose mihte hem þenne gete, His (!) was holde for Miracle grete. Þis Monk hem hedde, I ow say, And seide hem riht wel eueri day, And mony a special preyere Þat men han mad of hire here. Atte laste, as hit schulde falle, Þe Monkes þrote grete swalle, Men called þat vuel Comuynli, Þat he hedde, þe Qwinaci. His vuel bi-gon so to encrese, Wiþ-outen eny relece, Þat al þat þer abouten stood Seide he was ded, bi þe Rood! But neuer-þeles hit was not so. Vre ladi com to hym þo, As he tolde aftur mony a Mon, His leche to ben, as heo wel con; Wiþ hire pappe in to his Mouþ Milk heo spreynt, þat is selcouþ! And seide to him: “Mi seruaunt swete, I am comen þi bale to bete; Wiþ my seruauns haue I be, lo: Þat Made me beo so longe þe fro. Beo not a-ferd, þou schalt not dye, I schal þe hele of Maladye, Þi feire þrote þat me haþ serued I schal not soffre beo ouer-torned, Þy vois þat þou dest wiþ me grete At þis tyme schaltou not forlete, And, for ichaue ben longe from þe, Þe sannore schaltou heled be.” Vnder his nekke heo putte hire Arm, Wiþ hire swete fyngres stroked his harm. Þe swellyng slaked, he feld no sore. He set him vp anon-riht þore. Hym þou?te verreliche i-nouh Þat heo aweiward from hym drouh: And after hire faste he rauhte, But he hire take mihte nauhte. Þen he cried an heih al oute To hem þat weren hym aboute: “Vn-Corteis folk ?e ben, I-wis, Whi worschiped ?e not þe queen of Blis, AMong ou alle a space i-lete Þat þe ladi mihte haue sete? Ne seih ?e nouht hou louh heo went, Wiþ þe dost wel neih be-schent, ffor to salue me of my sore Whon my lyf was wel neih lore? Wiþ ?or noise, ?e folk vn-þriue, Out of þis hous ?e han hire driue.” Þerwiþ he wepte for Ioye wel glad; And euer was hire seruaunt sad, Worschuped hire Corteis and hende Euer to his lyues ende.— Oþur help or oþur leche Vs nedeþ not no forþere seche But Mari, Modur and Maiden clene, In heuene þat is so briht and schene. Preye we, heo preye hire sone Ihesus Þat euere he haue Merci on vs, Þat to his blisse he take vs to Þat is and schal ben euer-mo. Amen. IX. [Of an incontinent monk, þat was drouned, and rered a?eyn by vre lady to lyf.] A sexteyn was in an Abbey Of þe Ordre of Monkes grey, Þat louede to worschipe vr ladi; But fallen he was In lecheri. Whon his Breþren were to bedde i-gon, He wolde gon as stille as ston Out of Cloystre on his wilde-hede, fforte parfourne his misdede. Þauh he hi?ed faste for his Corage, Euere he wolde grete þe ymage Þat in þe chirche was mad of vre ladi, As ofte as he passed hit by. Hit bi-fel vppon a niht, To his walk he hedde hym diht, Bi þat ymage passed he And grette hit wiþ an Aue. Vnder þe Abbeye a water Ron, Þer-ouer was a Brugge of ston: Ouer þat Brugge lay his pas. But him bi-fel a wondur cas: As a mon þat hedde ben a-teynt He fel a-doun and was I-dreynt. Þer comen ffendes fers and felle To fecche his soule in to helle. A Cumpaygnye of Angeles swete Þorw Godus pite dude wiþ him mete, ?if þei mihte þorw godus gras Helpe þe soule of sum solas. Þe ffendes cri?eden sone anon: “?e wiþ þis soule haue nou?t to don, He is Iugget wiþ vs to gon ffor þe Misdedes þat he haþ don.” Þe Angeles al astoneyet were, ffor þei mihte schewe no good werk þere Wherfore þei mihte him calange And wiþ hem lede forþ in heore range. But as þei stonden alle a-gast, Þer com vre ladi swiþe fast. Heo seide: “þis soule whi haue ?e take, ?e foule ffendes blo and Blake?” Þei onswerde sone schortly: “ffor he diede sodeynly Wiþ-outen eny gode dede; Þerfore we schulen him quite his mede.” Vr ladi seide: “?e sey falsly; Whon-euer he went and passed me bi, He grette me wiþ an Aue, And þus he tok leue of me, Als euere he, whon he com a-?eyn, To sey an Aue he was fayn. ?e schul not sei we take hym ow fro Wiþ strengþe ne Manas ner-þe-Mo: Put we hit In þe Iuggement Of þe hei?e kyng, verreyment.” As þei þus striuen I-fere, Þorw Maries Mylde prey[er]e Hit lyked God, of alle souereyn, Þe soule to þe bodi wende a-?eyn, Þat he mihte here him-self aMende, Til god wolde aftur hym sende. His breþeren þat slepten in here wyse Weren awaked and wolden aryse, Gret wonder þei hedden hem among Whi þe sexsteyn was so long. . . XXX.

Ac noþeles hit is ful olde Þat Dauid in þe psauter tolde: ffor þis is þe latyn þat Dauid sede Þat “Mon ete Angeles Brede;” And þat is soþ, for so hit wes Þe tyme of þe prophete Moyses. [He] was in Egipte in gret truage, And godus folk in foul seruage, Vnder þe kyng Pharaon Þer was mony a þousund mon. Longe hit were al to telle; But atte laste hit þus bifelle Þat god nolde soffre hit no more His owne folk in þraldam wore, And god bad Moyses he scholde fle Wiþ his folk þorwh þe Rede séé. Þo Moyses to þe séé com, Al druye his folk wiþ hym he nom: Þe séé stod vp-riht as a wal, Til þei weore I-passed al. Kyng Pharao him suwed faste Wiþ his Chares and his hoste; And whon þei weore alle in þe séé, God torned heore strengþe a-?e, So þat þei were ouer-seynt, And he and alle hise weren i-dreynt. In þis place hit mai beo sede Þat mon ete Angeles brede: Þat tyme þat Moyses ladde þus His grete host In wildernus God dude lete reyne a-doun As hit were flour gret foysun, Manna, so hit is I-write, And is I-clept Angeles Mete. Heo hit gedrede and liueden þerbi, And sunged sore I wol telle ou whi: Þei gederde more, for drede of brede, Þen vche day þei hedde to nede; And hit nolde not ben on Morwe fforte kepe ne for to Borwe. Ich holde þis a badde store To vche Mokerere þat biddeþ more Of Catel þen he haþ to nede His owne Meyne forte fede; He buggeþ Corn a?eyn þe ?ere And kepeþ hit til hit beo dere. “Þer-of he doþ wysliche, ?if he departe hit skilfulliche.” Nay, forsoþe, þenkeþ he nouht To pore men parten ouht; Bou?te he neuere so good chepe, He reweþ nout þe pore wepe; He ne rouhte how al þe world ?ode, So þat his owne bi-?ete were goode. ffor þis is þe Mokereres onswere: “Goþ or wey, Corn is dere!” And forsoþe, wiþ-oute gabbe, Þe same onswere he schal habbe Whon alle þe Angeles in heuene beoþ And alle on eorþe þat þoleþ deþ Schul ben at a parlement: Þen þe Mokerere schal be schent; Þer he schal vbbreyded beo Of God him-self, þat is al freo, In what manere he haþ spent Þe godus þat God on eorþe him lent. Þere god him-self schal ?iue þe dome— He may beo adred er he þer come; ffor þis is þe word þat God wol say To þe Mokerere at Domes-day, And Certeynliche to non oþur mon But to þe wrecche Mokerere þon: “I hungred whon þou wernedest me mete; I was a-ffurst, I coude not gete; Herborweles, þou me forsoke; Seek, in prisun, þou ne come me to loke; A-Cold, Cloþeles also, Naked þou me lette go: Þerfore, Mokerere, þou wende to helle, Wiþ alle þe deuelen þer euere to dwelle.” Þe wrecche Mokerere onswere schal þan “Lord, whon sauh we þe neodi Man?” “?us, whon ?e warned þe leste of myne, ?e warned hit me wel a-fyne;” And þere hem tit heore onswere: “Goþ to helle, for heuene is dere.” At Domes-day þe meste schennes Hit falleþ vppon þe nyþinges; ffor þei neuermore wole hem schryue Þat þei weore niþinges in heore lyue, But euere heore onswere hit is þus “We ?iuen more þen men ?iuen vs.”— Torne we to vre gospelle, Of þe folk of Ysraelle, Hou þei gedrede Angeles brede More þen þei hedde to nede. Þerfore god wroþ was Þat þei trist not to his gras, And let hem dye; and were I-slay ffourti þousund on a day, ffor þat gult and oþur eke, And godus heste þat þei breke; Þat of sixe [hundred] and twenti þousende— Þus muche was þe noumbre to toknynge— Þat þer come non to londe freo Saue tweyne, Calef and Iosue— And of þulke tweyne com al þe strene Of vre ladi, heuene-Qweene.— Now is wel sene to-day Þat he loueþ vs more þen þay. ffor he ne sende hem but Angel brede, Þat lasteþ but a day to nede, He haþ send us a Ricchor sonde: His owne bodi, ich vndurstonde, Þat wol laste euere þe soule wiþ-Inne Whil þou art out of dedly synne. Þat was I-pyned for vre nede To-day þou seost In ffourme of brede. And þauh I wol ?ow schewe and telle Beo þis ensaumple hou hit bi-felle, Þat is writen In þe Legent Of þi[s] holy sacrament. Uidemus in altari formam panis, non carnis, &amp; quare. A Iew sum tyme and a Cristene mon Were felawes in þe wey vppon. And bi þe wey, as riht was, Þe Cristene Mon herde Rynge to Mas. Þe Cristene Mon seide: “a-byd me here, Whil I go to my preyere!” Þe cristene mon wente in to þe churche. And þe Iew bi-gon to grucche, ffor hym þhou?te his felawe was To longe biddinge atte Mas. Þe Iew ros vp and forþ ede In to þe Churche, to take hede. Þen sauh he atte weuede Þe Prest holde ouer his heuede A ffeir child, I-woundet sore In ffot, in hond; ?it sauh he more Þat þer nas nouþur wyf nor mon Of alle þat in þe Chirche were on Þat ne helde vp here hondes and sat on kne; And from þat child sauh come fle Anoþur such as he sauh stonde, A[nd] lihte bi-twene vche monnes honde. Þe Ieuh a-Bod, til þe Prest Vsede þe Eukarist, Þen sauh he him ete þe child Þat he bi-twenen his hondes held; And al þat weore in þe churche þermide Þe Ieuh þhou?te þat so heo dude. Þe Ieuh was agrise and wente him hyde Þer his felawe him bad abyde, And bi him-self he seide þan: “A grisly lyf haþ Cristen Man!” Þe Cristene Mon aftur þe mas Com to þe stude þer þe Iew was. Þe Ieuh asked: “hou farestou?” Þe Cristene mon seide: “better þen þou; ffor siþen ichaue my god seye, Þe lihtore ich holde al my weye.” Þe Iew seide: “beo my scolle, Wel ouhte þi wombe be fulle! Hedde I so muchel I-?ete, Þis þreo dayes nolde I no mete.” “fforsoþe,” quaþ þe cristene mon, “To-day say? I siht of non, Non eorþliche kunnes mete Þat my Mouþ mihte ete.” “Let beo! I sauh wiþ myn e?en two Where þou and oþur mo, Vche of ow heold a child blodie, And siþen ?e eten hit, I nul not lye; Wherfore i seye þat oure lawe Is not good.” bi þat sawe Þe Cristen mon bi-gon to beo wroþ; “Þou lyest, Iew, þou art me loþ; ?oure lawe is fals, and so ?e ben, ?e wol not leeue but þat ?e sen. Þerfore al-one I go þe bi, I kepe no more þi cumpaygni.” Þe Iew seide: “ffelawe, greef þe nouht Þeih I telle þe what I sayh and þouht, Ac tel me bi sum oþur preue Wher-bi I may þe soþe leue!” “Þis is þe skile,” quaþ þe Cristene man, “Þat god nout soffreþ þe þan Þat þou se?e wiþ þin e?e Þe sacremens þat ben so sle?e, Þat his fflesch mihte so ben hud To vs cristene wiþ-inne þe bred. And þy kun made hym dye, Þerfore al blodi þou hym se?e.” “ffelawe,” quaþ þe Iew þon, “Help þat I were a Cristene mon; ffor leuere ichaue cristned ben Þen euere seo such a siht a?en.” Þo was þe Iew cristned, and oþur mo, ffor þe Miracle þat fel þo.— Þis Bred þat is godus flesch, What feiror preue wolde men esch Þat vche part is godus entere? Þeih hit weore parted in þreo quartere, And þeih hit weore an hundred dole, Vche part is his bodi al hole. And þat loke bi skile, lo here: Bi-hold þi-self in a schewere: Þou ne sest but onliche þi faas, Þe while al hol is þe glaas; And brek þe glas in two or þre, And so moni formes þou miht se.— Beo þe makyng of þe oblee Wel and skilfoliche me may se Of w?uche we make Godus fflesch, Þis is þe saumple whose wol esch. Hit is maad beo seuen skiles A?eyn þe seuene dedly synnes: A?eyn Lecherie hit is whit, Þat was Blak and stynkynge euere ?it. Hit is þunne a-?eyn Glotenye, Þat al to muche wole swolewye.

And hou hit furst com and ede Þat mon ete Angeles Brede, Hit is liht soþ to telle, ffor vche cristene mon wot hit welle. Þe laste soper wiþ-outen wene Was I-mad atte Ceene, And God bad þe Apostles do so Whon he weore to heuene I-go; “Do þis in þe muynde of me; I go and come to ow a-?e.” Of þe Apostles þat God sent [tok] holichurche þe sacrament.— Þat is to siggen, eukarist As goode grace com from crist. Wel may we seyen hit is good grace Whon hit is wardeyn in godus place! And grace is betere þen nature, Whose þerto wol take cure.— I rede þe mon be in good entent Whose takeþ þis grace in sacrement: Seint poul seiþ, and siggen I may, In þe pistel of to-day: “Whose vnworþiliche ?ode To fonge Godus fflesch and blode, Þere he fongeþ his owne dome”— Allas, hit falleþ so to lome! Þerfore poul seiþ bi þat halue: “he demeþ not God, he demeþ him-selue.” In þulke whose i-take be, Schal he neuere beo dampned a-?e; ?if we vre owne dom take, What oþur dom schal God vs make? Þerfore make ow alle Redi To take hit not as fool-hardi.— Þeih seint Poul vs þrete þus, Vr lord hym-self, swete Ihesus, Þis day in Markes gospelle To his disciples he gon telle, And to þe Iewes þat were ryue: “I am my-self Bred of lyue. “Mi fflesch soþfast mete is, And my Blod verrey drinke, iwis. Whos eteþ mi flesch and drinkeþ my blode, I wone wiþ hym and he wiþ me. Mi ffader me sent and so I ?ode, To lyue for hym and he for me: So whose me eteþ, for me schal libbe. Þis is þe Bred þat from heuene come, Not lyk Manna, þat flour be sibbe, Þei þat hit ete, weore dede bi dome, And hose eteþ of þis brede, He schal liue wiþ-outen ende.” Ihesu, graunt vs so to spede Wiþ þulke bred to heuene wende. Amen. Off þulke Bred in þe gospelle Seint Ion we here þus telle: Þat ?if we ne ete of þulke brede Ne drynke his blood, vr lyf were dede.— And þeih we ete hit al þus here, Hit is in heuene al entere.

Sum tyme such lawe þer was Þat vche sonday after mas Eueri trewe wyf and Mon Schulde be hoseled or þei eode þon. . . . And þat for þis enchesun, I wol ow telle for what resun: On was, for þat folk mis-bere Hem-selue, whon þei hoseled were. Þe toþer was, for þe grete trauayle Þat holy churche hedde be þat entayle, In nome of þat for Godus drede Me ?iueþ nou þe holy Brede. Þerfore þe pope ordeyned, þries in þe ?ere Vche mon I-hoseled were; And bote he were ones atte leste, Þe pope Comaundet be his heste Þulke bodi þat so ne dede Schuld neuer be buried in holy stude. Þerfore beo redi, I ow Rede, fforte fonge Angeles Brede. And beo þis Bred I wol ?ou telle A luytel ensaumple hou hit bi-felle. De manu sacerdotis per hostiam penetrata. Be-fel sum tyme In Engelonde, Þer was a prest, ich vndurstonde, Þat ladde not his lyf, as was tolde, Also clanliche as he scholde. God wolde he scholde hym amende, And he hym a strong vuel gon sende, So, he wende almost to dye. And on a day þis siht he se?e: A child boþe he seih and herde, And asked hym hou he ferde; In his hond bret-ful he beere Of bernynge Obeleis a paniere. Þe prest asked: “what is þat, And þou þat askest of my stat?” He seide: “Ich am Godes Messagere, And þeos Obeleis þat ben here, Þus monye vnworþily þou fong, Whon þat þou þi Masse song; And ?if þat þou nult I-leue me, Scheuh forþ þyn hond, and þou schalt se.” Þe prest heold forþ his hond anon, And þe child tok vp on Of þe obeleys þat were so rede, And pult hit in þe prestes hond amidde. Hit fel þorwh þe prestes hond on, And þe child a-wey gan gon. Þe prest let men come hym to And tolde hem whi he ferde so: “Lo,” quaþ he, “hou I am diht! Who sauh euere such a siht?” Þat þorw his hond me mihte se As brod as was þat obele. And he not I-maymed nas, And afturward song mony a Mas, And an hole þorwh his hond— Þus þat soþe men hit fond. After for a þousend pound of golde Þe prest no more synne wolde, But serued god wiþ gret drede, And afturward to heuene ?ede.— I holde þe Mon more þen mad Þat takeþ þis bred and nis not drad Of þe wreche þat mihte bi-falle. So worþi bred hit is wiþ-alle Þat for þe miht of þulke word Þat god seide at his owne bord, Þe same miht þat word haþ here, To torne þe bred in oþur manere, And to torne þe wyn in blode, Þe same þat was sched on Rode. Þe wordus perauenture I coude telle, Ac I am not worþi and þerfore I nelle. Ac oþur makyng of þe Mas I dar wel telle hou hit was. Þe Apostles seide no more But what þei herde of cristes lore— No more to þe masse nolde þei do, And þe paternoster to, vppe þe bred and vppe þe wyn— And so hem þhou?t hit good and fyn. Non oþur vestimens vsud þay But as þei wereden vche day; And in vessels of treo— Non oþur chalys hedden heo. Þenne þe pope vrban, Þat was a ful holy man, Ordeynde þat þe Chalys scholde Ben of seluer or of golde, Wiþ a patin, to hule ouer al, Maked of þe same Metal.

Þenne þe pope Tollophornus, And þat oþur pope Cynacus, Bi-twene hem boþe ordeyned was To synge þe Gloria to þe Mas . . . . He hit Confermede, pope Gregori, And made þerto þe Offertori. Þenne þe pope Anastasius Comaundet in lawe riht þus: Þat no mon schulde sitte, he beede, Whil þe gospel were to Rede. Constantinus þe pope made þe crede, fforte siggen hit he bede. Pope Steuene and pope Clemens Ordeyned þe holy vestimens. Pope Ciluester ordeyned þe Corporas, In tokne þat godus bodi was In clene lynnen cloþ I-wounde Þat tyme þat Iosep hit founde In his owne toumbe of ston And leyde a-noþur gret vppon. Þenne þe Pope Leouns Made alle þe Prefaciuns.

Sixtus þe Pope ordeynde vs Þry?es to synge Sanctus. Þe Pope made þe Canoun þer, And God made þe Pater noster. [A]nd hou and what-maner bi-felle Þat God made þe paternoster, I wol telle. His Apostles seide hym on a day: “Teche vs, lord, how we schul pray.” And seint Ion haþ tauht vs þis— Þat is on of his disciples— Þat Ihesus tauhte hem þis preyer And bad hem seyen þe Pater noster. And þus muchel to seyen hit is: “Vr ffadur þat in heuene is, Halewed mot þy nome beo. And to þi kyngdam þat we teo. Þi wille in heuene and eorþe beo do. Vre vche-dayes bred send vs to. And vre dettes for-?iue vs, As we for-?iue vre dettours. And lede vs in no fondynge, But saue us from vche vuel þinge.

Þe laste word of þis hei?e fest Is I-seid Ite Missa est, Þis is to seye “hit is i-sent To heuene for vs, þis sacrament”; Bi-fore þe holy Trinite Þe furste part of þe þre, Þat oþur for hem þat þoleþ deþ, Þe þridde for hem þat alyue beþ.— Hit is ri?t þat furst inempned be Vr ladi in þe Canone: ffor God of hire þat flesch toke Þat neuer cristen mon forsoke; Þat flesch he haþ take þe to fede, Þat is i-cleped Aungel Brede. Þe twelue Apostles I-nempned beþ, ffor heore prechynge þei þolede deþ— As þing i-sent ben þe Apostles, And Martires ben þe Apostles witnes; And alle þe Martires þat weore dede ffor þei weore witnesse of þis Brede, Þat God di?ede for loue of vs, And þei for loue of Ihesus. Petur and Andrew, Philip, þeos þreo weore don vppon þe Rode-treo. Poul, Iames, and Mathew Were be-heuedet, and Bartholomew Was huld al naked quike ffor his witnesse of þis onlike. And þat oþur Iamus, Symon, and Taddeus, Heore senewes for cristen lawe Out of heore bodi were i-drawe.

Þerfore is riht heore nomes to be Nempned in þe Canone: ffor alle þeos di?ede In good entent ffor to Meyntyme þe sacrament.— Þe sacrament mot þe soule fede Þat is i-hote Angeles Brede. ?if þou worþiliche hit fonge, Hit schal kepe þe þus longe, ffrom þulke day þat þou ded be Til þi bodi rise a-?e; And þenne boþe bodi and soule i-fere Schal wende to þe graunt Mangere Where neuer-more tit no nede To non eorþliche Brede, But þe siht of þe Trinite Schal euermore þi fode be.

Septem miracula de corpore cristi. God Almihti þat alle þing weldes, Wyndes, watres, wodes and ffeldes, And soþly, as þou madest of nouht Alle creatures þat euer were wrouht, ffor-?if vs, lord, þis day vr synne, Þis digne sacrament to bi-ginne, And also worschupe þer-of to speke, Þat we neuere þe trouþe breke, Ne forte telle in þis Prolonge (!) Þing þat falleþ to eny wronge, But þat hit mihte beo þe to queme And vs in studefast trouþe to ?eme.— Godus sone in heuene a-boue, He schewed vs also muche loue: ffor whon his passion neih?ed him neih, To his disciples þat weren him by He ?af his bodi, hem to fede— More loue miht he not schewe in dede— Þat þei schulde muynde haue Of hym þat miht hem þenne saue. ?it a-forward he let hym slo Wiþ so gret deþ-pyne and wo. ffor vs and hem dude he þis, To bringe vs alle to his blis. More loue miht he not do, Ne neuer mon mihte do so; ffor vs he dude hit, in certeyn, Þat we schulde loue hym wel a?ein. Þouh we vr-self [?af] an hundred siþe, O poynt of such loue miht we not kyþe Lyk to þat loue he haþ vs done, ffor hit is vre saluacioune. And of vs ?it askeþ he nouht But þat may wel I-nouh be wrouht: Noþing bote loue wiþ good louyng, To loue him ouer al oþur þing And for his loue to leue synne— Wiþ loue his blisse þen may we wynne. And þou may neuere haue hym to þe But þou wolt furst synne fle: Alle þing he loueþ, but synne he hates; ?if þou loue hym, wiþ synne þou bates. ?if þou loue on, þou most nedes fforsake þat þyng þat he forbedes, Elles hit is told for no loue, And nomeliche to vr lord aboue. Þou mai?t not loue him, þe boc seiþ, But þou haue wiþ þe good feiþ, Þat is to sey, leeue þou hit wel Al þat is writen of hym vchedel. Studefast treuþe of loue hit semes, And of trewþe loue men nemes: So is þat on wiþ þat oþur, Wiþ studefast treuþe loue, his Broþur. To whom ou?te vr loue be went? To trouþe of þis sacrament. Þis schulde leeue vche cristen mon And lerne þe treuþe of on þat con: Þat þe bred þat sacrefyed is On þe Auter, is godus flesch, fflesch and blod, þer hit is leid, Þorwh þe wordus þe prest haþ seid; Þat lihte wiþ-Inne þe virgine Marie And on þe Rode for vs wolde dye And from deþ to lyue a-Ros, God and Mon, in Miht and loos. ffor hose troweþ not þis cler In þe sacrament of þe Auter, He schal neuere þe blisse a-byde, ffor no þing þat him may be-tyde. In þe Olde lawe þus is writen— Iewes and Cristene wel hit witen: “God seide þat hit was wrouht, He Comaundede alle þing of nouht”— Þis wordus aren verrey and cler, Dauid hem seide in þe psauter. Seþþhe he made al of nou?t þat was, Lasse Maystrie were in þis caas fforte chaunge on liknes In to a-noþur þyng þen hit is, Þat ilke liknesse in Bred and Wyn In fflesch and blod to torne hit in. His fflesch and blood in Bred is wrouht; Siþþe he made [al] be-fore of nouht, ?if þou seo hit not bodiliche in siht, Þi soule wiþ-Inne schal trouwe hit riht; And þau? þow fele no sauour But verrey wyn and bred of fflour, Þis is wisdam of godus ordinaunce, To saue vs alle from þis Chaunce: ffor ?if hit weore as flesch to take, Wiþ-stonde we scholde and hit forsake; And for he nolde we hit forsoke, Bot alle men hit vndurtoke, Þerfore his wisdam his owne rede Sauereþ hit in wyn and Brede. Hit semeþ bred as to þe siht And as Bred hit sauereþ riht; Nouþur in siht ne in felyng Knowest þou of no certeyn þing. What schal þenne þe most saue But studefast þouht þat þou schalt haue, Studefast trouþe of vch a del, Þat wol vs saue wondur wel. And summe han hit seyen Bodily, To whom he schewed his Mercy. Lo her a tale al and sum Þat is In Vitas Patrum: 1. Narracio cuiusdam religiosi. Hit was a Mon of Religioun, Of alle Men he hedde gret renoun; And, for þe fend wolde him haue schent, He leeuede not in þe sacrament, And seide, hit was not Ihesu Þat Conceyued was þorwh gret vertu, Ne Ihesu was not þat Oble Þat was reised atte sacre And þat þe folk honourede to; To leeue hit was not to do. Bi-fore two Abbotes þus he tolde— Þis Abbotes write þis tale to holde, Hit scholde be told to eueriche mon Þat is a?eyn þe Cristendom Til hit beo preued bi Clergye Wher hit beo treuþe or heresye. Þis Abbotes schewed him þe rihte wey, Wiþ alle þe ensaumples þat þei couþe sey; And al he seide hit was lye, But ?if he se?e hit wiþ his e?e “Don þen so þat I hit seo, Þen wol I leue þat hit so be.” Þis Abbotes preide a ful seue-niht Þat he wolde schewe him, to trouwe his miht, In fflesch, in Blod on þe Auteer, To Conferme his trouþe cler. And him-self preide specialy Þat god wolde schewe hym in Body, “Lord, for no mis-bileeue, Þat þow scholdest wiþ me greue, But forte schewe þe riht soþnes Þat þow art sacrament of þe Mes, Þat I may make oþer certeyne Whon I wiþ e?en haue þe sey?ene.” Þis Abbotes ly?e in orisoun Til þat þe seueniht were don. Þe Sonenday to Churche þei come, Þat oþur Mon wiþ hem þei nome. A sege was ordeynt for hem þre, To bi-holde al þat priuite Of þat holy Sacrament Þat scholde be schewed in here present. Bi-twene hem sat þis ilke mon Of whom þe Miracle furst bi-gon. Whon þe oble was on þe Auter leid And þe prest þe wordes hed seid, Alle þre þou?te hem verreylike By-fore þe prest a Child lay quik, In feir forme, of fflesch and blod; Þis say þei þre þer þey stod. Whon þe prest scholde parte þe sacrament, An Angel [doun] from heuene was sent And sacrefyed þe child riht þore: As þe prest hit brac, þe Angel hit schore, Þe Blod in to þe Chalis Ron Of þat child, boþe God and Mon. Þe prest ?ede to þe hi?este degre, To hosel him as hit fel to be; Hem þhou?te þe prest brou?te on þe patin Mosseles of þat child newe slayn And beed him a Mossel of þat fflesch, Wiþ al þe blod þer-on al fresch. Þen gan he crie wiþ loude steuene: “Merci, Godus sone of heuene, Þe Bred I sauh on þe Auter ly?e Hit is þi bodi, I seo wiþ e?e; Of þe Bred þorwh sacrament To fflesch and Blod hit is went; Þis I beo-leeue, and euere I schalle, ffor verreyliche we seon hit alle.” Whon he and þei weore alle certeyne, In forme of Bred hit tornde a?eyne. He dude him hosel as oþur wore, And was a good mon for euer-more. And al oþure beo þe bettre Þat hereþ þis tale or redeþ þis lettre.— Þe Prest þat sacreþ Godus bodi, He moste beo ful clene nedeli; A lewed mon þat schal hit receyue, Alle-Maner fulþe moot he weyue. But beo þou neuere so good a prest Ne neuer so gret wiþ-Inne þi Brest, I rede þou here hou þei are schewed, Al-þauh þei ben of langage lewed. Þou wost wel, in þe Oble Is a luytel þyng to se: So schaltou beo luytel in wille, Luytel and Muchel wiþ-outen ille, Nout in pride ne in heihþe, ffor no wisdam ne no sleihþe; Þe soþe hit is wiþ Lucifer, Proude men schal wone þer. Þe Oble is mad of whete, Þe Beste corn þat men of ete: So schulde we beo meke and louely To alle þo þat ben vs by; Þis Mekenes is a-?eyn þat Ire Þat is wiþ Lucifer in þat fyre. Þe paast of þe oble nouht ne owe Beo maad of no-maner sourdowe, ffor þe sourdowe makeþ al soure Þe swettest þat comeþ of þe floure. Bi þis sourdowe is tokenynge Þat Envye is a wikked þinge, ffor hit for-doþ alle swetnesse of dede, Þat god scholde ?iue vr soules meede; Þerfore makeþ he non herburgrye Þer he fyndeþ biforen envye. O vertue In þe whete is Þat is muche a-?ein Slouhnes: Þer whete comeþ he wol not prike, As Otes don and Barlike: Ne we ne scholde not be prikel In Idelnesse ouer-Mukel; Idelnesse gruccheþ and is heui of þouht And is soone wroþ for nouht, And þat wraþþhe comeþ of sorwe, And of wonhope wol muche Borwe. Þis sacrament of þe Messe Loueþ not such Idelnesse, Not wiþ non nul he dwelle Bute þer men of þe Ioye spelle. Þe paast of þe oble seid beo-forn Schal not beo of medlet corn, Bote al onliche of whete: ffoule desires schal men lete, Þat bi-meneþ, In no wyse We schal vs ?iue to Couetyse, Þat is also called Aueryce, Þe whuche is a foul wikked vice. Also þou seost þe oble is þinne And muche honeste wiþ-Inne: And þat wol wel signefye A?eyn þe sinne of glotenye; Þer wol not þe sacrament reste, Ac glotenye wol him out keste. And as þou sest, þe oble is whit: So schul we haue no-maner delyt Of no-maner fflesches take, ffor lecherie makeþ þe soule blake. Þeos seuene partyes beþ In þe Oble, as we seoþ, And eueri propurte þer-Inne Is a?ein an hed-synne. A-?eyn þis sacrament do þo Þat aren in synne and þerto go, Or aren in wille a?eyn to wende To synne and hem-self schende; As prest þat goþ to synge Mes Þat in dedly synne is; An hondred-fold he sungeþ more Þe[n] he a lewed mon wore. Alle þat receyue þe sacrament In dedly sunne or wikked entent Or in eny of þeose seuene Þat þou hast here herd nempne, Riht to heore Dampnaciun, And þerfore vengaunce schal be don. And here I schal telle a tale Hou hit is to þat mon Bale: 2. Narracio presbiteri parochialis. A Parisch-prest was in a Toun, Of ful gret discrecioun, fful good and rihtful he was, And god sende hym of his gras: Of his parischens he vndurstode Whuche wer vuel and w?uche wer gode. Two he hedde forte gete Þat nolde neuere synne lete. And hit felde on an Asterne, Þat þe prest scholde non hosul werne But hit were for þe gretur synne, Inobedience or Corsyng Inne: Þis prest was in ful gret þouht Wher he schulde hosele hem or nouht. He preyede to God, heuene-kyng, Þat he wolde sende him tokenyng Wheþer he scholde hem hosul forbede; To ?iue hit hem he hedde gret drede. ffrom god he hedde þis onswere: Þat vch on scholde heor oune charge bere, And þat he scholde werne hit none But ?iue hit forþ to euerichone; “Do as Ihesu dude in dede, And þou schalt no mon hit forbede, No more þen he dude Iudas Þat hedde I-don a gret trespas; Ihesu ?af alle wiþ mylde mood, Whon Bred was turned to flesch and blod. ffor summe þat hit take hit schal hem saue, And summe þerfore peyne schal haue; Aftur þey aren of synne clene, Also schal hit on hem beo sene.” ?it preyed he god of More grace: Þat he mihte knowe be þe face Whuche resceyued hit worþily, And w?uche to haue hit not worþi. And [god] graunted him his wille, To knowe þe goode from þe ille. Þe folk þat to þe prest went fforte receyue þe sacrament, Of somme þe face was also briht As þe sonne In somer-liht; And summe þe visage was also blak Þat noþing miht hit Blakore mak; Of somme hit was as red as blod, Starynge as þei weore wood; Of somme þe visage was bolled stoute, As boþe heore e?en welleden oute; And summe nymped wiþ feet and hondes, As dogges don þat gnawen heore bondes; And somme hedde visages of Meselri; And somme were lyk foul Maumetri. Moni wondres weore on hem seene, Mo þen he couþe þenne deme. Þe prest, whon he sauh alle þise, Of þat siht he gan to grise, ffor þat siht he was hidouse And dredful and Meruilouse. ?it pre?ede he god wiþ good entent Þat he mihte wite what al þis ment. And god almihti louede him wel And wolde schewe him eueridel: “Þo Men þat weore so briht As þe sonne on day-liht, Þo Men aren ?it in Charite And clene of synne, and worschupeþ me. Þo Men þat were so blake Þat no þing mihte hem blakore make, Þo weore lechours foul wiþ-Inne And haue no wille to leue heor synne. Þo Men þat weore so red as blood, Þei are tirauns wikked of mood, Heore Euencristen for to slo Wiþ dede and wiþ word also. Þo þat þow sauh wiþ Bollen visage, Þo aren Envyous and ouer-outrage. And þo þat nymped her fingres and hendes, Are Bacbyteres bi-twene frendes. Þo þat þou sauh Meseles bi siht, Þey loue more good þen god almiht. Þo þat þou sauh lik Maumetrie, On worldly þinges þei most affye, More loue þei catel þat he haþ sent Þen þei don hym þat al haþ lent. Þeose-maner men are riht in wille In heore synne to leue stille, And þerfore schal þe sacrament Of hem aske heor Iugement, Þat þei haue resceyued him vnworþily And serued þe fend wiþ ful Envy.”— Þis tale is told for loue of þo Þat in synne to hosul go, Or ben in wille to torne a?eyn; Al heore trauayle þei don in veyn. ?if þou wole þyn hosel saue take, Beo in wille þi synne to forsake Euermore in studefast herte; And ?if þou synne in bodi smerte, God takeþ hit nou?t to so gret grim As þou in tresun Receyuede hym. In no þing wot I more tresun Þen bringe þi lord on his felun, And ?it men seiþ þe synne is to greue Þat bringeþ a trewe mon on a þeue. ?if þou do þus þi witande, Þen chargen hit me moste on hande. Þerfore loke þou wite nouht No synne I-hud In herte ne þouht! ffor no Clerk þat is in synne, Til he leue and þer-of blynne He schulde not serue atte Auteer Ne hondle þing þat comeþ þer neer. I touched er of þis outrage Whon I spac of þe sacrilage, Þat þe holigost schewed him nouht ffor þe Dekene syngede in þouht; In þe tale of Ion Grisostomus Þis tale is told, for ow and vs. Als is he worþi to ben i-schent Þat sone aftur þe sacrament To folye and to synne drawes— Luitel of Godus vengaunce hym awes! ?if þou for?ete or ouer-sittes Þe tyme of hosul þat þou wel wittes, Luitel fors of him þou ?eues, Nouþur þou louest hym ne leues. And ouer al he loueþ þe best; And þou ne wolt a nihtes gest Leten hym herborwe in þin hous! Þou art vnkynde and Meruylous, Þat al þe ?er þou letest him weyue, Wiþ worschipe woltou not him resceyue. God Manaseþ for þis chesun, ffor riht hit wole and eke resun: ffor suche men aren holden vntrewe In þe Olde lawe and in þe newe. Comaunded In þe Olde lawe was Ones in þe ?eer to schewe þi trespas. Þe newe lawe is of þe more honour, Ones in þe ?eer resceyue þi creatour, Ones a ?er him to knoweleche, Þi lord to plese for doute of wreche. Þat prest i blame ouer alle þinge, Wiþ-outen gret skil þat letteþ to synge; ffor mony a soule mihte I-saued be Wiþ þat Masse þat þenne leueþ he. ffor alle þat in þe peyne Is, Abydeþ socour of þe Mes, ffor eueri Masse makeþ Memorie Of soules þat aren In purgatorie. Muche þonk schal he haue Þat helpeþ soules for to saue; No þing may so muchel avayle Of heore peynes and heore trauayle As þe sacrament of þe Auteer, Hit makeþ hem of peynes cleer. And þat may I schewe apertely Bi a tale of seynt Gregori: (3.) Narracio felicis presbiteri. Seint Gregori seiþ for þe same: Hit was a prest, ffelix his name; Bi-syde he wonede in a paþe, Was a wassching In an hote baþe. Þis prest ofte þider ?ede, To wassche him whon he hedde nede. Þis prest þer euer [redi] he fonde A Mon to wassche him, to foot and honde; He drou? his hosen of and his schon And redi was hem on to don; At eueri tyme he þider com His herneis feire of he nom, And seruede him at eueri tyde In þat watur and ofte beo-syde. Þis prest þat com þider so ofte, Þat þis mon þer seruede so softe, He ne askede hym neuer-more Wheþen he was ne hou he com þore; But eueri tyme he was redi And seruede him ful apertely. Þis prest þou?te, “he serueþ me wel, His trauayle wol I quite sum-del.” On a day he þider þouhte And twey loues wiþ hym he brouhte. In to þat baþ ?eode þat prest And wusch him as he dude nest; Þis mon was þere him a?eyn, To serue him wel he dude his Mayn. Þis prest, whon he scholde go, He ?af þis mon þis loues two, And þonked him muchel his seruyse, And more he scholde haue oþurwyse. Þis Mon onswerde þis prest a-?eyn: “Þis bred ?e bringeþ to me in veyn, ffor neuer-more schal I ?ete Bred ne non oþur mete: I am a Mon þat is ded, Þat neuer-more schal ete bred.” Þe prest asked: “on what manere Is hit þat þou wonest here?” Þis Mon onswerde in þat tyde: “I was lord here ar I dyede, And þis seruise þat I am Inne Is þe peyne for my synne. Bote I þe preye par charite, Offre on þe Auter þes loues for me; And I beseche þe ouer alle þynge Þat sixe Masses for me þou synge; And heo weore songen, I hope to wende In to þe Ioye wiþ-outen ende. And whon þe sixte masse is left, ?if þou ne fynde me her eft, Trouwe [þou] þenne forsoþe i-wis Þat for þi preyere I am in Blis.” Þis prest al þat wike longe ffor þis mon preyede and songe. And whon þe wike was al gon, Þe prest com þidere, and fond non; He hopede wel þat he was brouht To blisse, for he ne fond him nouht.— Beo þis tale ?e may se Þat hit is gret Charite Masses for þe dede to synge, Þe soules [out] of pyne forte bringe. Ouer alle þing hit haþ pouwer, Þe sacrament of þe Auter, And nomeliche whon hit is don Wiþ good monnes deuocion; Him wol god sannore here Þen on þat is him nouht so dere. In þe seueþe Comaundement Toucheþ to þis sacrament In a tale of þat kniht, Hou þe prest þat liueþ not riht, Of his preyere is luytel prou, And þere hit telleþ wel hou. And I schal telle anoþur here Of a Masse of a good frere: (4.) hou a man of Souþfolk was saued þorou a masse. A mon in Souþfolk ones dyed, Bi-sydes Sudburi, as men seid. ffor þat mon such grace was diht Þat him was graunted to come a niht fforte speke wiþ his wyf, To mende þe fautes of his lyf. “?ef a Masse,” he seide, “were for me don Wiþ a good monnes deuocion, I hope to Ioye for to go And beo dilyueret of al my wo. I preye þe, dame, par charite To trauayle so muche for me.” Heo graunted hym þat ilke bone, And ros vppon þe morwen sone And to þe ffreres sone heo eode, Þer heo hopede best to spede. Heo com and spac wiþ a ffrere And preyed heo moste his masse here, And for hire hosebondes soule to synge, And heo wolde ?iue hym offringe. Þe ffrere dude hire a Mes In Comuyn, as þe seruise is. Whon þis Masse I-songen was, Heo wente hom a good pas. Þe niht aftur þenne com he. “Slepestou?” he seide. “nay,” seide heo; “Are ?e ?it,” heo seyde, “in blis? Þe Masse for ow I-songen is.” “Þe Masse,” he seide, “þou dudest do, A parti hit helpeþ me þerto; Mi part ich hedde of þat Mes As of þing þat Comuyn is. ?if on weore specialy for me seid, Of my peyne I were ful leyd, ?if þe prest were of lyf so good Þat God his preyere vndurstood; I hope þenne grace to haue Þat his Masse mihte me saue;” Ofte he seide to his wyf: “A prest, A prest of clene lyf!” On þe Morwen forþ heo eode To þe ffreres eft to spede, And schewed hit to þe priour, And preyed him of socour; ?if he hedde eny broþur Þat he kneuh beter þen oþur, “Þat wol synge me a Mes ffor a Mon þat ded is, At myn ese he schal haue To a pitaunce what he wol craue.” Þe prior spac to a ffrere And preyed him on alle manere Þat he wolde a Masse synge ffor þat soule heo made preyinge. Þe ffrere was an holy mon; And ar [þat] he his Masse bi-gon, He preyed to god his orison, Wiþ a gret deuocion, Þat hit mihte ben him to pay, Þe Masse þat he scholde synge to-day. Whon þe Masse was don to þe ende, He bad þe wommon hom [to] wende, “And whon þou more eft heres, Cum and sey to vre ffreres!” Þe niht aftur—lustneþ now!— He com and seide: “slepestou?” “Nay,” heo sayde, “hou fare ?e?” “Wel,” he seide, “and so worþ þe!” “Sire, weore ?e a-payed of þat Mas Þat for ow to-day songen was?” “?e,” he seide, “graunt Merci! Þat Masse to me is more worþi Þen al þe world an hundred siþe, Ne miht haue mad me neuer so bliþe. His preyere was to god so dere, ffor al þat he preyede he wolde here; Þeih he hedde prei?ed for a þousund mo, ffrom peyne to blisse þei hedde i-go; ffor what þing he hedde asked bone, God wolde ha graunted him ful sone. Haue good day! for now I wende To þat Ioye wiþ-outen ende. God lete þe neuere þer-of mis, Þou ne he, to haue þat blis.” Þe wyf com sone on þe Morn And fel on knes þat ffrere bi-forn And tolde him þer eueridel Hou he for his preyere was wel. And þat ffrere ful wel he lette, And þonked God, for Ioye he grette. Wel weore hym at his endynge Hedde such a prest for him to synge!— In þis tale schewed is: Of alle þing good is þe mes, Þe sacrament on þe Auter Ouer alle passeþ his pouwer. In þe Masse þei hem a-fye Þe soules þat are in purgatorie. Þe sone is offred to þe ffadur of heuene ffor þe soules þe prest wol nempne; Þat is þus for to mene: ?if þe prest beo good and clene, Þenne wol Ihesu crist hym heere, ffor what þyng he makeþ preyere; Preye he for soule or for bodi, Þat aren in pyne or in nuy, Boþe wol god almihti saue What þe gode prest wolde haue. Not only for soulus is he herd, Bote eke for vs here in þis world. Beo a Mon in seknesse or in prisun, Weyferynge, or in temptaciun, Or in eny oþur trauayle, Þe sacrament wol vs a-vayle; Hit wol delyuere vs out of peyn, ?if vr trouþe beo certeyn. And þat was wel schewed in dede In Engelonde, so seiþ seint Bede: In his Bokes writen hit is, A feir Miracle of þe Mes: (5.) Narracio Bede. Þat tyme seint Bede was liuonde, Weore Mony kynges in þis londe. Bi-twene two was gret Batayle— Þerfore i telle þis Meruayle; Þat on hiht Edfride, of North Cuntre, Þat oþur of lindeseye was he. Edfride hedde gret seygneri, Seynt Andreu hosbonde of hely. Þis Batayle was bi boþe heore a-sent Bi-sydes a watur men calleþ Trent. Sire Elfride broþur hette Eleswynne, He was slayn þat Batayle Inne; On boþe partys ne was non So feir a kniht of fflesch and bon, Ne non so douhti was of Armes— Þerfore seint Bede pleynede his harmes. A-noþur kniht was feld doun Nerhonde ded, and fel in swoun; Þe nome of þis ?onge kniht Ruyna, seiþ seint Bede, he hiht. Whon þis Ruyna hedde long leyn, He keuerde, and seet vp a?eyn, And stopped his woundes þei schulde not blede, And, as he mihte, þennes he ?ede, To seche him help sumwher to haue, Of frendes fynde him to saue. As he wente wiþ muchel drede, He was taken wiþ kyng Coldrede; And brouht him to a lordyng, An Erl, þat heold of þe kyng. Þe Erl asked him what he was, And wher he hedde ben in hard cas. ffor doute of deþ he was a-friht And dorste not seye he was a kniht; He seide: “sire, ?if þi wille be, I am an hosebonde-mon of þe cuntre, I was wont to lede vitayle To knihtes þat weoren in Batayle; And nou I am a pore mon, Þus fro þis Batayle I com, And wolde fonde to haue my lyf, Til I may come to my wyf.” Þis Erl dude a leche bi stoundes To tente to hym, to hele his woundes. Þat tyme was here mony þeodes, Mony vsages, and mony leodes, ffor vche a kyng in þat dawes Vsede his diuerse lawes: Summe were cristene in vre fay, And summe leeuede in paynymes lay; Þerfore þat tyme was muchel þro, And ofte was boþe werre and wo. ?if a kniht miht oþer men take, He scholde hem sulle or in seruage make. Wherfore i telle so of þis kniht: Þe Erl let him bynde eueriche niht, Þat he ne scholde from hym fle Ne stele a-wey to his cuntre. ffor al þat þei mihte him bynde, Ofte loos þei dude hym fynde; Neuer so faste þeih heo him bounde, Loos a-noþur tyme þei him founde. Þis bounden kniht, Ruyna, Hedde a Broþur, þat hihte Tymma; Þis Tymma was prest Religious, ffor he was Abbot of an hous, So longe he liuede in þat estre Þat his nome heet Tymmestre; Þat tyme, as ich vndurstonde, Hit was in Northhumberlonde. Þis Abbot hedde tiþinges certeyne Þat Ruyna was in Batayle slayne. He com to Trent, þis Abbot Tymma, And fond a bodi lyk to Ruyna; Honorabliche he dude hit graue In his chirche þer he wolde hit haue, And song þerfore day and oþur: He wende hit hedde ben his broþur. Þauh Tymma hedde chosun wrong, His broþur hedde þe goodus of þe song— ffor God al wot, and wust hit þere ffor whom he made his preyere:— Þeih men a-niht þis kniht bounde, A-Morwe þei hym loos founde, Men mihte hym neuere bynde so fest Þat þei þat tyme nolde al to-berst. Þe men þat hedde þis kniht in holde, Þis wondur to þe Erl þei tolde. Þe Erl hedde þer-of gret wondur Þat þis bondes weore so in-sondur; He seide, him-self wolde wiþ him speke And wite whi his bondes dude breke. Bi-fore þe Erl was he set, And þe Erl feire he gret. “Sey me,” he seide, “þou belamy, Const þou wel on sorcery? Sum wicche-craft I trouwe þou bere Þat þi bondes þe not dere; fforsoþe,” he seyde, “sumwhat þou dos Þat euer-more þei fynde þe loos.” He seide: “wicche-craft con I nouht, Ne for me schal non beo wrouht, Ne I nul be by fendes craft vn-bounde beo, bi no wicche-craft. Sire Erl,” he seide, “hit is a-noþur: In my cuntre I haue a Broþur, Þat leeueþ wel þat I beo slayn, ffor I com not hom a?eyn; ffor me he syngeþ vche day a Mes— prest, abbot forsoþe he is. I wot wel, þat is þe enchesun Þat my Bondus here vndon; ffor no þing ne haues pouwer A?eyn þe sacrament of þe auter. ffor, ?if I weore ded, in oþur werld, His preyere for me weore I-herd, To bringe me out of peyne and wo, And siþen to blisse forte go.” Al þat Meyne and þat Erl Leeuede wel he was no cherl, as he to-fore hem hedde i-seid Whon þei on hym furst hond leyd; Bi his semblaunt and feir beryng Hym semed wel a gret lordyng, Bi his speche þei vndurstood Þat he was mon of gentil blod. Þe Erl tok him in priuite, Wheþen he was telle scholde he; “Sey me soþ, and, as I am trewe kniht, Þou schalt no skaþe haue, be my miht.” “Seþþhe þou me bi-hotest pes and griþ, I am þe kynges mon Eldriþ; Armes I bar in þat Batayle, Wiþ my pouwer him to auayle.” “So me þhou?te,” seide þe Erl, “Þou semed not to ben a cherl. Bote for þi knowlechyng her me bye Þou weore worþi for to dye, ffor þou halp þer to slo, Þat al my kynde is ded me fro; Bote, for I er sikerde þe, Scha[l]t þou haue no skaþe for me.” He eode and sold him for Raunsoun At Londone to a ffrisoun. A ffrisoun, ?e schul vndurstonde, Is a Mon of ffrys-londe. Þis ffrisoun scholde þis Mon forþ lede, And dude on him bondes for drede, ffor a-skapyng bi þe weye He dude bondes on him leye. Bot þat vaylede him no-þyng Neuer a day, þat byndyng: ffor in þat tyme þe masse was songen, Þe bondes to-barst and al to-sprongen. Þis ffrison þhou?te: “hou may þis beo? He may riht wel from me fleo; Happyliche hit a-vayleþ nouht Þe Catel þat I wiþ him bouht.” Þe ffrison seide: “wolt þou wel Restore a-?eyn al my Catel, And I schal ?iue þe leue to go To þi Cuntre þat þou com fro. But furst þou schalt me trouþe pliht, And trewely hold hit wiþ al þi miht, To bringe þe Catel I ?af for þe, And elles I graunte þe not fre.” He graunted him al þat he seide, And trouþe in hond wiþ hym he leide. Þis Ruyna wente to kyng loer, Þat was kyng of Caunturber— He was seint Andreus suster sone, And Ruyna was wont wiþ hym to wone; Of al his stat, boþe wo and wele, Ruyna told him eueridele. Þe kyng ?af him his Raunsun; And [he] bar hit to londun to þat ffrisun. Seþþe eode he hom, þis kniht Ruyna, To his broþur, Abbot Timma, And tolde him of al his wo-fare And of his cumfort in al his care. Þis Abbot wel vndurstood Þat his Masse dude him gret good And þe sacrament gon hym borwe Out of seruage and out of sorwe. Þis tale telleþ vs seynt Bede In his gestes þat we Rede.— Bi þis tale may men lere Þat Masses helpeþ vs wel here: ffor vs liuynge hit makeþ Memorie, Also for þe soules in purgatorie. Vche mon schal leeue þat riht Þat helpen hit wolle as [hit] dude þe kniht. Þis sacrament helpeþ not ?it alone, Bote þe offrynges euerichone, Al þat we offre atte Mes, Al to vre saluacion hit is. Not only forte saue þe dede, Þe quike hit saueþ also and rede; As wel haue þe quike þe prou As þe dede þerof þe vertu nou; Quike and dede, More and lesse Ben I-saued þorwh þe Messe. Þe Offringe is as a present, Þat helpeþ vs wiþ þe sacrament, To þe ffadur of heuene tentefuly, ffor whom þou offerest to haue Merci. A tale I fond ones I-writen, And as I sauh hit, I wol ?e witen, And wel a-cordeþ in alle þinge Þat God is payed of good offringe. (6.) Of a man þat was closed in a myne. Hit was a Mon bi-?onde þe séé, A Mynour, wonede In a Citee. Mynours, þei makeþ in hulles holes, As men don þat secheþ coles. Þe Mynour souht stones vndur molde Þat Men of maken seluer and golde. He wrouhte and holede in þe hille. A perilous chaunce fel hym tille: A gret parti of þe Myne ffel doun þer and closed hym Inne. His felawes alle þat weren hym hende, Þat he weore ded wel þei wende; Þei eode and tok hem alle to Rede, And tolde his wyf þat he was dede. Þis wommon bi-menede hir hosebonde sore— God leeue þat mony such wymmen wore!— Heo helped his soule in alle þynge, In almes-dede and in offringe; Heo Offred for him atte Auter fful of wyn a picher, And [a] feir lof wiþ-al, Eueri day as principal, And al þat twelf-moneþ stabely, Bote o day þat passed forby. ffewe suche wymmen [now] we fynde Þat to heore hosebondes are so kynde! Bote þis wyf wiþ al hire miht Dude for him [boþe] day and niht. Hit fel at þe twelfmoneþ ende, His felawes to þe hul gon wende, And come to þat same stude eft Þer þei heore felawe in werk left. Riht þere þei furst bi-gon Þei percede þorwh in to þe Mon: Þe Mon In good stat þei founde, Liuinge, wiþ-outen wem or wounde. Euerichone þei hedde ferly, And þat was gret Resun why! Alle þo men weore in gret weer How he hedde lyued al þat ?er. Bote þenne he tolde hem euerichon How he hedde lyued þer al-on: “I haue I-liued gracious lyf Þorwh cortesye of my wyf: Eueri day heo haþ me sent Bred and wyn to present; But o day, þenne eet I nouht, ffor my mete me nas not brouht.” Þei ladde þe mon in to þe toun, And tolde þis Miracle vp and doun, ffurst þorwh þe Citéé, And seþþe þorwh al þe contre. Hit com in spekyng atte laste Þat day þat he dude faste. He tolde hem þe dayes name, And his wyf seide þe same: Þat day heo offrede neuer a del, Þe goode ffriday hit mihte be wel. Now may ?e here þat almes-dede Gostlyche wole a mon fede, And so may ?e wel vnderstande Þat God is payed of good offrande.— ffor al þis tale in ?or lyues Trustneþ not in ?or wyues, Ne in ?our children no-þing; Makeþ or-self ?our offring! So kynde a wommon as I of tolde Liueþ not now, beo ?e bolde! Ne no clerk þat þis redes Schal fynde non nou of so kynde dedes.— ?e men þat are nou In present, Þat hereþ rede þis sacrament, Ouer alle þing hit haþ power, Þe sacrament on þe Auter, As I haue here to ow i-schewed, Not to lered bote to lewed. ?e lewede men, I telle hit ow— Þis clerkes con hit wel I-nouh. Prei?e we þenne vr creatour, Þat þe sacrament, vr saueour, Þat Bodi and soule he wol vs saue, And we him to loue and he us to haue. Amen. XXXII. Hou a man schal lyue parfytly. In nome of him Alweldyng Þat is vr hei?e heuene-kyng, Takeþ hede here in alle wyse To fleo þe sunne of Couetyse And alle þe dedly Synnes samed Þat her-aftur schul beo named. ?e mouwe also here hardily Hou mon schal lyue parfytly; Þenne schul ?e here also What is þe wille of god euermo; Also schul ?e here now rede What þing makeþ mon holy in dede; Þen schul ?e here, ?if ?e wol trouwe, Hou mon schal him-self knowe, In bodi and in soule also, Wher he liue treweli or ne do; Also mowe ?e here in hi?

Herkneþ alle feire and stille: Heere schul ?e so of godus wille, As witnesseþ folliche hit Þe Bok þat is cald holi writ: Þe seuen dedlich synnus, þe braunches also, I wol ?ow telle, ar ?e go; Þe seuen vertuwes of Ion þe Ewangelist, Þat was ful wel wiþ Ihesu Crist; Þe seuen ?iftus of þe holigost, Þe whuche ben of mihtes most, And of heore strengþe also I-feere Sumwhat þenne mowe ?e lere; Þen schul ?e heere in presens Whuch ben þe ten Comaundemens; Þe[n] schul ?e heere feir and briht Of þreo vertuwes and of heore miht, Þat is ffeiþ, good hope, and loue, Þat wol vs bringe to blisse aboue; Of þe twelf Articles of þe ffey Schul we also sumwhat sey; Of þe seuen Sacramens, Þat euer ben in godus presens; So schul ?e heere sum or al Þe ffoure vertuwes Principal: Prouwesse, Rihtwisnesse, and Meth, Strengþe also wiþ hem he geth; Of þe seuen werkes [of merci] also— Lord, ?if vs grace hem wel to do.— Videte vocacionem vestrum. (Paul, 1 Cor. 1, 26.) Þis wordus here þat I ow say, To Religious men longen þay; Þus muche ben þei forte mene, As ?e schul heere al bydeene: “Seo,” he seiþ, “bi-holde ?e To what þing ?e cleped be.” Þat he seiþ, hem to redresse And to sturen hem to Parfytnesse. ffor eueri Mon þat lyueþ here Ouhte ha Ioye and Serwe I-fere: Ioye for þe worþily wonynge Þat is ordeynt to wel lyuynge, Serwe also to haue þerbi ffor vre liuynge vnrihtfuli. ffor her seiþ seint Eusebi Wordus þat ben ful dredfuly: “A Mon to Religiun him dresse Is aller-hext sikernesse; Not parfyt liue þer-inne son Is aller-hext Dampnacion.” In Religiun we to beo don Is aller-hext Saluacion: ?if þow wolt þat saluacion proue, Al þat is good þou most loue, Þou most loue eke also Al þat Religius longeþ to; Þou most al þi wille ?iue Parfytly and sikerly to liue. And seint Bernard vs techeþ in hi? To liue Mekeli, loueli, and worschipfuli. Þat “worschipfuli” is to mene, To Godus worschipe feir and clene, Þat þou do al þyn entent To don al his Comaundement; To don his biddyng þou not asterte In al þat þou may þenke wiþ herte, And loke þou no þing þer-of breke Wiþ al þat þou wiþ mouþ mai speke, Or worche in dede wiþ-oute striue Wiþ eny of þi wittes fyue, Wiþ si?t of E?e, wiþ Tonge tastyng, Smellyng of Neose, of Ere heryng; What þou dost bi wei or strete Wiþ bodi worching, going wiþ feete, Liggyng, stondyng, þenkyng also, Loke ?if hit beo godus wille or no. ?if hit beo his wille, do hit son; ?if hit ne beo, hit not don, Do hit not þenne for no maystrie, Þou? þou scholdest þerfore dye.— Þenne mony mon loud and stille Wol aske, what is godus wille. Hit is to vs boþe more and les To haue vs euere in holynes.— Þenne is to wite what, and whi, Þat makeþ a mon þenne holi. Two þinges þer ben In worchyng: Þat on is loue, þat oþur knowyng; Þat is knowyng of alle soþnes, And loue of alle grete goodnes. To knowyng of god þat is soþnes Maist þou not come in blod and flesch, Bote to knowe þin owne flesch, And also godus grete goodnes, Maistou not come, as I þe mene, Wiþ-outen loue of þin Euencristene. To knowyng of þi-sel[f] maistou Come þorwh good þenkyng nou; Þou may?t come to godus knowynge Þorwh þin owne feire plesynge. To knowe þi-self old or ?inge Maistou come bi þis bithinkynge: Þenk bisiliche, I preye þe, What þou weore, art, and schalt be, ffurst as to þi bodi here, Seþþhe to þi soule þat is so dere. As to þi bodi: foulore hit is Þen euer was eny donge, I-wis— Was neuer ?it dounge so foule Þat wolde so stinke, rote and moule; Þou weore in so gret fulþe igete, Abhominable hit is þerof to speke; Þou schalt beo dilyueret to frete To Todus and oþur wormes mete. What þou hast ben &amp; art, haue in mynde, Þat þi soule beo not beo-hynde;— What þi soule schal beo in tyme comyng, May no mon knowe but heuene-kyng. Þenk þou hast In chele and hete I-do mony wikkednesse and grete, Þenk also, hem to redresse Þow hast laft mony gret goodnesse. Þenk also, þat þis beo not weyued, Þat longe hast lyued, and muche reseiued, And hou þou hast spendet þat reseit; To þe þenne wol þis beo ful streit: ffor vch a tyme, drede þe nou?t, Þat þou hast not on god I-þou?t, Þou hast so loren of þi dispens And don a?eyn þi lordus defens— ffor hit is vr lordus biddyng To loue him ouer al oþur þyng. ffor þou schalt ?elde also a-counte What vch an Idel word wol amounte, Also to Acountes þou schalt beo brou?t ffor euerich Idel werk and þouht; And as vch an her on þin hed is wried Þat is saued schal beo glorifyed, Also schal no þing ascape Wiþ-outen a-counte erly or late. . . . ffor þe soule þer hit is holde, Is more þen al þis worldus molde— Here is muche of godus grace! ?it schal hit ocupye no place. Þe Bodi and þe soule ben al a-stray, Diuerse þou?tes, willes, disires al day: Ho mihte þenne seche his herte so ni? To ?iue acountes al trewely Of al þat euere he hedde mys-wrouht Or eny mis-dede hedde in þouht? Seoþ now, breþeren bi ten or twelue, How ?e ha neode to knowe or-selue!— Tac good ?eme what þou [now] art To soule, and let hit not astart, Whon þou hast in þe luytel of goode, Luitel of wit and pouwer and moode, Þis is þus muche forte say Þat þou coueytest vche a day Þing þat nouht is worþ in dede Ne þat þe helpe mai at gret nede. Help vs god þat sitteþ on lofte, ffor elles beo we bigyled ofte, Oþurwhile þorwh Ragynge as vnwitti, And oþurwhile beo veyn glori; Now are we trauaylet in to drede I-lope, Now beo þe wey of fals hope. Þow art so chaungable be-hynde &amp; bi-forn, Þat we wol to-day we wol not to-morn; Ofte vr-seluen for to plese Are we aboute worldly ese, But we haue hem at vr wille We beo turmented, us þinkeþ wiþ ille: Whon þou hem at þi wille most hast, Þen art þou wiþ hem agreued mast. Þenk wel ?it, I rede þe, Hou liht þou art to tempted be, ffebel and Brutel to stonde a-?eyn, Redi to asente wiþ al oure mayn. Of alle þeos Merueylous chaunces Vr lord haþ sent vs diliueraunces, And vche oþur day þerfore He vs dilyuereþ more and more. Whon þou weore nou?t, he formede þe, Þi soule to his liknesse to be, And þy stinkynde bodi also ffoormed he wiþ lymes two, So feir and noble and of gret prise Þat no Mon may no such deuise. Þenk bisiliche, ?e Þat loueþ or ffadres and modres fre, Whi ?e louen hem so tenderly— I wolde wite þe resun whi. ?if þou seist þus, as soþ hit is, ffor þou wer born and geten of her flesch: So don þe beestes, soþ to say, Þat breden of Mon and wommon al day. Þe soþe ?if þou wol lerne þen, Bodi ne soule nastou of hem, But bi him ful witterli Þat is vr lord, god Almihti. What heddestou ben, I preye þe, ?if þou heddest stille such i-be In fulþe of synne as þou i-gete were? fful Abhomynable hit is to here. ?if þou loue broþur or suster þan ffor þei ben of þat fflesch i-tan Þat þou weore þi-self also— Þerfore þat loue hast þou hem to: Þou scholdust þen loue hard and nesch A pece of ffadur or Modur fflesch In þis Maner, þat I sei here, Al on Schornes þei? hit were. ?if þou sigge in þis degre Þou louest hem, for flesch figured þei be To þi liknes, and for þei han Soule of god as þou hast tan: Bi þis is he no more þi broþur But on as muche as is a-noþur, But in as muche neuer-þe-latur As ?e hedde boþe on flesch-fadur, And þenne þe biginnyng of vre flesch Is stynkynde fulþe neuerþeles. Of O flesch-ffadur alle we came, Adam was he cald bi name; And for he dude so gret folye, Scholde we neuer loue her fleschlye, Bute vche Mon þus scholde loue oþur Gostlich here as sustur and broþur.— Ihesu, þat is vr aller kyng, As I seide atte bygynnyng, Whon þou weor nou?t, þen formed he þe. Whon þou weore lore, þen fond þe he, Whon þou weore sold in sorwe and sinne, Þen bou?t he þe wiþ muchel wynne; Whon þou were diht, i-dampned also, Þen mihtfulliche he saued þe þo; Whon þou weore boren in synne eke, He Baptised þe wiþ wordus swete. And whon þou sungest, al day to se, Þen Mekeliche he soffreþ þe, And longe he wol ?it þe abyde, Resseyue þe aftur, so may be-tyde, And putte þe in to his swete couent, Euer to beo to him present. Whon þou mis-dost, he wol þe þrete, Longe he bydeþ ar he wol bete; Whon þou syngest wiþ wille fre, fful sone wol he for-?iue hit þe. Whon þou mis-gost eke also, He þe Amendeþ wiþ wille ful þro, Whon þat þou in doute art ouht, In to þe techyng he haþ þe brouht; Whon þou art hungri in eny neode, ffeire he ordeyneþ þe to ffeede; Whon þou hast colde, he warmeþ þe, Mon, Whon þou hast hete, he keleþ þe þon; Whon þou wakest, he saueþ þe so, Whon þou slepest, he kepeþ þe to; Whon þou rist vp, he þe sosteyneþ, Whon þou fallest, he þe reiseþ, Whon þou sittest, he halt þe ek, Whon þou stondest, he strengþeþ þi feet, And also, soþ for to say, He vndursitteþ þe euere and ay; Whon þou gost, he wol þe lede, Whon þou a?eyn turnest, resseyueþ þe eke, Whon þou gost mis, a-?eyn calleþ he, Whon þou art seek, þi cumfort to be. Such goodnesses in mony degre Haþ vr lord god I-do for þe. And goodnesse in þyn herte wore, Þou weore holden euer-more Alle dayes to þenke [on him] I-wis, And alle tymes to þonke for þis, Alle dayes to speke to [him] Aboue And alle dayes him hertly loue, And also wel, ?it i þe say, On niht as vppon þe day. Þerfore þou þat art þus wrou?t, At euen and morwe haue þus þi þou?t Hou mony þousund men to say Han perisched in þat niht or þat day, Summe in bodi, soþ hit is, Summe in soule leosen her blis; Summe in fuire and oþur maneere, Summe in water þat is so clere; Summe Robbed and woundet also; Summe sodeynly to deþ han go Wiþ-outen schrif and hosul þen Þat hem þe rihte wei scholde ken, And for defaute of Confessiun Parauntur go to dampnaciun.

And of alle þeose wikkede chaunses Haþ crist mad þe diliueraunces, He haþ þe saued as mihti kyng Wiþ-outen þyn owne deseruyng! And what hastou don him and whare Þat haþ þe kept from al þis care? ?if þou toke þus goode kepe Whon þou awakest of þi slepe, Hou mony goodnesses he haþ þe do, And euer is to þe aboute mo, Þow schuldest him loue souereynli Ouer al þis world, witterli; Þou schalt him fynde so bisy now Euermore a-boute þi prow As non oþur þyng he aboute were But þe to kepe whil þou art here.

Loke þenne þat þis beo þe rif, Her-wiþ to lede holy lyf.— Þreo Maners þer beo þen Of Contemplaciun vs to ken: Þe furste of hem þat þer is, In Creatures hit is, i-wis; Þat oþur in holy writ, we fynde; Þe þridde in god and in his kynde. Contemplaciun is, siker ?e beo, Þe goodnesse of god for to seo. Bi his Creatures may þou seo þan Þreo þinges ben In god and Man; Þis þreo ben, vs to redresse: Miht, wit, and gret goodnesse. . . Wit to god þat is sone, Goodnes to god holigost in wone. Þorwh his miht, þat wel was torned, Alle þinges þei ben formed; Þorwh his wit, so wel demeyned, Alle þinges wysliche he ordeyned; Þorwh his goodnesse, not denyed, Alle þeose þinges he multiplyed. His pouwer maistou seo þe laft Þorwh her gretnesse and here schaft; His wit also wiþ-outen distaunce Þorwh heore bounte and ordynaunce; His godnesse may we seo ful newe Bi heore Multiplicaciun and vertuwe. Heore gretnesse may we seo Wiþ foure propurtes þat þer beo, Þat is folliche for to say Þorwh heore hei?nesse and depnesse ay, Þe oþur two ben of strengþe Þat is þorwh heore brede and lenge. His wit maistou seo ful breme, ?if þou þerof take good ?eme, Þer as he haþ ?iue sum creature þore Beoyng wiþ-outen eny more, Þat is as muche forte say As stones þat ben in world al day. . . . He haþ ?iue to oþur þynge Lyf, beoynge, and fleoynge, And al þise ben bi his hestes To þat þing þat men callen bestes. To oþur haþ he ?iuen also Lyf, beoynge, and fleoinge bo, And also more þing of Renoun: He haþ to hem I-?iue resoun; Þis þing is I-?iuen þen Boþe to Aungel and to men. Stones noþing may þei feele, Ne grases, and ?it lyue þei wele; Bestes lyuen and feleþ þe; Mon lyueþ and waxeþ as doþ þe tre, And as a Best feeleþ, he doþ, And resun as Angel haþ he soþ. Þenk þou on þat dignite To creature of Mon is ?iue so fre, Hou þat his ?ift wiþ honoures Sormounteþ alle oþur Creatoures. Þerfore seiþ Austyn þus fol riht: “I nolde ben Aungel, þei?

Þe goode bestes þat meke beo þon, Beoþ maad for þreo þinges for mon: ffor to helpen vs wiþ-outen fayle, As schep, hors, kuyn, in vre trauayle; And vs to feede, and vs to cloþe, As leþer, fflesch and wolle boþe, As Corn on eorþe and foules to be And also ffissches in þe Séé. Þe nuy?ing gra?es and bestes venimous Ben ordeynd for þreo þinges to vs: ffor chastisyng, and amendement, And for techyng wiþ good entent. Chatised and punissched we ben in route Whon we ben hurt, and in such doute; And þat is ful derworþli Of Godus owne grete merci— Þerfore bodili he com To Chastise vs, boþe god and Mon, Þat we nere dampned wiþ-outen ende ffor to dwelle wiþ þe ffende. We ben amendet whil we wol mynne Þat al vr wo comeþ fro vr synne; Whon we seo þe soþe þus So smale creatures may greuen vs, Þen may we þinke þat we be fful of ffebelnesse and of ffrelete, We ouhten alle to beo ful Meke. Whon we godus werkes wol se and seke . . . Whon þou hast þus monyfolde Þe werkes of god folliche beo-holde, Lift vp þyn herte wiþ wille liht And þenk þe Muchelnes of Godus miht, Þat alle þing ordeyneþ in delyt, And al hit is for vre profyt. A, Lord, Merci! what schul we say Bot we þe serue to þi pay? Al þat he vs ?af to Multiplie, Alle þo Bestes we distruye; ?if God ordeyne and forme hem, We beo bisi to strui?e hem þen. Loue God for his goodnesse; Honoure him for his feirnesse; Glorifye him at þi redres And also for his grete prouwes.— Þen is þer a-noþur degre Of Contemplaciun, I telle þe, Þe w?uche trewe and soþ is hit: Þat is cald holy writ; Þat wol teche þe wiþ-Inne, To drawe þe from peril of synne, Þe peyne forte douten ay, To loue þe Ioye þat come may. And euer loke, aboute þou be To holde wiþ þe Charite, Þis world also in alle wyse Þou beo aboute to dispise; Loke þou what is to done, And also loke what is to schone. Of þis two þinges seruen hit Al þat is writen in holy writ: Þis ben þo two, to trowe, Þat þou schalt boþe leeue and knowe W?uche ben þe seuen synnes dedly, And þe seuen vertuwes þerby, Þe ten Comaundemens al-wey, And þe twelf Articles of þe fey, And þe seuen ?iftus of þe holigost, And þe seuen sacremens most, And þe seuen werkes of Merci, And þe vertuwes of þe Ewangeli, And þe Ioyes also of heuen And þe peynes of helle to nemen. Off þe seuen dedly synnes. Seuen Sinnes þer ben dedly: Pruide, Wraþþe, Sleuþe, and Envy, Glotonye, and gredines also, Couetyse and lecheri, wiþ hem to go. Pruide no-þing elles ne is Bote loue to muche monnes hihnes. And of him comeþ oþur seuene: Vnbuxumnes, þat draweþ from heuene, A?eynes god, be þou serteyn, Or elles a?eyn his souereyn; Þat is to sei, I telle þe son, To leue þat is hym beden don— Þus is he peired and not mendet, He doþ þing þat him is defendet. Þat oþur þing is Auauntyng, Whon mon of oþur monnes þing And to him-self bi wikkednes He hateþ and bringeþ him in distres. Þe þridde spice is Ypocrisye, Whon mon feineþ him to haue in hi?e Holines þat he haþ nouht, And doþ his wikkednes in dede and þou?t. Þe ffeorþe spice, hit is þen Dispit þat he haþ to oþur men, Whon mon reherceþ oþur mennes good dede, He wolde beo holde þe beter in leode. Þe ffyfþe spice is Arrogaunce boun, Whon a Mon Makeþ comparisoun Bi-twenen his vuel doynges And oþur mennes for eny þinges, ffor his wikkednes and trespas Scholde seme muche þe las. Þe sixte spice is boldnes in nome, Whon a Mon haþ no schome Of his grete wikkednes forþi Þat he haþ don so openly. Þe seuenþe Elaciun is to rede, Whon mon is proud of his vuel dede. Þou schalt wite boþe in and out Þat þis þreo þinges makeþ Mon prout: Þat is to wite and haue in muynde Þe goodes þat he haþ of kuynde, Þat is of feirnes, or strengþe to say, Or souereyn wit, or Noblay— Þat noblei calle I in þis stage He þat is prout of hei lynage. Þat oþur þing is and euer was Þe godus þat men han of purchas, As wittes, vertuwes euerichane, Graces, Dignite, and eke good fame. Þe þridde is worldly godus þus, As Cloþinge, housynge, Rentes, possessions, Meyne, and also gret honour Of þe worldly þinges in eueri stour. Off Envye comeþ, haue we no care, Ioye of oþur mennes vuel-fare, And also to make sweryng gret ffor oþur mennes wel-farynge and get. And þat may ben in herte stinkynge, Or in Mouþ þorwh Bakbytynge, Or in werkes of vuel entent Þorwh defaute of good entisement. Chidyng waxeþ of Wraþþe þen, Swellyng of herte amonges men, Schomeful wordus þenke to seyn, Sclaundre, and also gret dedeyn. Of slou?þe comeþ drerines, wikkednus, and swelling Of foul wille, wiþ gret þretyng, Aboute godus comaundemens not to do, Wonhope, Rechelesnesse also, Outrage wille of herte to sen Aboute þinges þat defendet ben. Off gredines comeþ tresun prest, fforswerynges, and wikked rest, Violence, and hardnes of herte A?eynes Merci wiþ muchel vnquerte. Þenne þer comeþ of Glotonye Veyne gladnesse, and Lecherye, ffulþi, Muche speche in hi?ing, And ful feble vndurstondyng. Of Lecherie comeþ blyndnes of herte, In Orisun wiþ muchel vnqwerte— In al þe preyers he scholde in be Nis þer wiþ him no stabulte; Of him comeþ fool-hastines also, Loue of him-self wol wiþ hym go, Hate of god þat vs bouht, Loue of þis world þat is nouht, Drede of dispeir Is al his wone Of þe world þat is to come. Þeose ben þe seuen dedly synnes forþi. Wel may þei ben cald dedli: Þe furste þreo dispoyleþ þe mon, Þe ffeorþe abateþ hym as he con, Þe ffyfþe byndeþ him in bonde, Þe Sixte deseyueþ him in londe, Þe seuenþe him put in þraldome, Him to muche harm and schome. ffor Pruide, beo þou þerof bolde, Bi-nymeþ a Mon his god to holde; And Envye bi-nymeþ also him fro His euencristen, from god to go; Wraþþhe, þat is a schrewed delf, Bi-nymeþ a Mon his owne self; Of Slouþe þat ilke foule synne Euere hit tormenteþ hymme; Gredines in eueri toun Casteþ þe vnsely mon adoun; Glotenye deseyueþ hym in luytel stage; Lecherie put him in foul seruage. Seuen blessynges of god. A ?ein þis seuene vices þus Ordeynt remedie sone Ihesus, And send us seuen vertuwes in hihe In þe holy Ewangelye, And seiþ þus in þis Manere As ?e schul her aftur here: “Blesset be þe meke of spirit euene, ffor heoren is þe kynedom of heuene”— Þis is a?ein pruide and mood, Þat bi-nymeþ a Mon his god so good. “I-blesset beo þe deboner þen A?eynes heore euen-cristen men, ffor þei schul haue in to heore honde Þe lond þat is euer lastonde”— Þis is a?eyn þe foule Envye, Þat bi-reueþ mon his euencristen trie. “Blesset beo þo þat wepen ofte, ffor þei schul beo cumfortet on lofte”— Þis is a?eynes wraþþe to delue, Þat bi-nymeþ a Mon him-selue. “Blesset be þe Merciable men, ffor god schal haue Merci of hem”— A?eynes gredynes þis mot be, Þat of no mon he haþ pite. “Blesset beo þo þat hungri be þen Aftur Rihtful, disyr forte ken, ffor þei schul be fed in blisse”— Þis is a?ein Slouþe and rechelesnesse. “Blesset mote þe clene of herte be, Þe face of god schul þei se”— Þis is a-?eyn glotenye doyng, Þat euer þenkeþ on flesch lykyng. “Blesset be þe pesybles i-tald, Godus children schul þei be cald”— A?eynes lecherie þis ordeynt wes, ffor þe lechour naþ neuer pes; He naþ no pes for his beste, He may in herte neuer ha reste. Þeose ben þe vertuwes seuene A?eyn þe vices forte nempne. Seuen medicines for þe seuen dedly synnes. Afftur þis he wol vs teche, God þat is vr goode leche, Þis seuen medicines, trie to vs, To helen vs of seuen Maledius, And þus he confermeþ hem In to seuen vertuwes þen Bi vertue of þe holy gost, Þat is lord of mihtes most. Þeose þei ben to nempne þat þing: Þe holigost of wisdam and of vndurstondyng, And also, wiþ-outen fayle, Þe gost of strengþe and of counsayle, Þe gost of wit and of pite, Þe gost of doute of god mot be. Þorwh þis seuen ?iftes god ?af mon Al þat he haþ neode of þon To his Bodiliche lyf And to his soule wiþ-outen strif. Seo hou mon may in his mode Leue þe vuel and take þe gode: To leue þe vuel þat is forbod Techeþ þe gost of þe doute of god; Þe gode to do, I telle þe, Þat techeþ þe gost of pite. Two þinges þer beo þan Þat letteþ good doinge of man: Þat on is worldly riches, And also gret frouwar[d]nes; Riches, hit mon deseyueþ, ffrouwardnes from god him weyueþ. Þerfore a mon schal dispise Worldly richesse in alle wyse, Þat he beo not deseyuet beo hit: Þat vs techeþ þe gost of wit. And þou schalt suffre stalworþli Tribulacions and anguyses worldli, Þat þou neuere ouercomen be: Þus techeþ þe gost of strengþe to þe. Þeose foure ben souereynly To bodiliche lyf forþy. Þat oþur longen wiþ-outen strif Alle to þe gostly lyf. ffor þreo maners bi resun Ben of Contemplaciun: On is [in] Creatures bi vre entent: Þat techeþ þe gost of entendement. A-noþur in holi writ also, Þat þou seost what þou schalt do And what þing þou schalt lete: Þat techeþ þe gost of counseil swete. Þe þridde is of him-self, god and Mon: Þat techeþ þe gost of wisdom. Now seo we now hou Ihesu þe lele Is euer aboute vr help and hele. Þe ten comaundemens of god. Afftur þis schaltou witen þen W?uche ben þe comaundemens ten. Þe furste, hit is be þin a-cord: Worschipe to O god, vr lord. Þen þe fend þe may not derue, ?if þou him only worschipe and serue. Worschupe him þorw feiþ and mode, And serue him wiþ werkes gode. Þenk ?if þou haue alle tym Trewely honoured hym, And ouer alle oþur þinges Serue[d] hym and his biddynges; Þenk ?if þou haue ?olden him þi beo-hest Þat þou be-hi?test hym mest or lest: Þou him be-hi?test feiþful trist Whon þou toke þi Baptist; Or ?if þou haue lasse penaunce don Þen þe was leyd penaunce vppon. Þorwh þis comaundement al-to-gader Mon is ordeynt to god þe ffader. Þat oþur bi-heste is forto seyn: Nempne not godus nome in veyn. Þorw þat is defendet lesynge, ffalshede, and forswerynge. Þorw þat is eueri good mon in wone Ordeynt touward god þe Sone, ffor he him-self bereþ witnesse And seiþ “I am soþnesse” expresse. Þe þridde heste is forte say Þat þou kepe wel þin haly-day. Þat is to sei, vch an heih fest Þat comeþ þe to, mest or lest, Haue þin herte in pes and reste most. Þat ordeyneþ mon to þe holygost.— Þeose þreo hestes techeþ ow and me To beren vs to god þe Trinite, To whos liknesse Mon is mad In soule, þat scholde be trewe and sad. Seuene oþure techeþ men Hou þei schul bere hem to her euen-cristen. Þe furste is: worschupe þou folly fflesch-fadur and modur and þi gostly. And þat in two Maner of þinges: In boxumnesse and for-berynges, And help hem bi þi pouwer in dede Of alle þinges þat þei haue nede. Þen schalt þou beo of long lyf In eorþe here wiþ-outen stryf. ?if þou wolt haue þe lyf longe, Worschupe þi god wiþ wille stronge, ffor he þe brou?t, wite hit wel, Al þi lyf euerich a del. Þat oþur heste, hit is þon: In no wey þat þou sle no mon. Þenne schaltou wite here, Mon-slau?t is in þreo manere, In þreo manere hit is ful smerte: Of hond, of tonge, and of herte. Of hond hit is wiþ-outen meþ Whon a Mon wiþ wepene sleþ, Or whon he putteþ him in dede In prisun or in oþur stede— Þat ilke doing cause may be Of his deþ, as I sei þe. . . . Monslau?t of herte is also here In oþur two vuel manere: Whon Mon coueyteþ oþures deþ in hi?e, Or for de-faute leteþ him dye And nil not helpen him in þat mester Ne him deliuere, ?if he ha pouwer. Þen is hit þe þridde heste: To do no lecherie, mest ne leste. He þat wol lyue wiþ-outen dy?ing In þe blisse of heuene-kyng, Him weore neod to kepe ful boun His dedlyche lyf from corupcioun, ffrom þat corupciun, sei I, Þat wol come of his bodi. Þe ffeorþe heste is, witerli: To do no þefþe ne Robberi. He þat wol spare oþurmennes lyf, Bi-nyme him nouht wiþ no strif, Þorwh w?uche bi-nymynge Þou mai?t bi-reue his lyuynge. Þe ffyfþe heste þen is þis: Þow schalt bere no fals witnes A?eynes þin euen-cristen þen, Ne also þou schalt not cumforten hem Þat wolden liue in reste and ro (!) Heore neih?ebors harm to do. ffor bi a fals witnesse i-bore A Mon may worldli beo forlore. ?if þou no counseil in no res To him þat wolde liuen in pes Wiþ hys euen-cristen to debate; ffor ?if þou dost, hit torneþ to wrake. Þe sixte heste wiþ-outen strif: Coueite þou nou?t þi nei?ebors wyf, Ne non of his seruauns also, Ne nou?t þat him longeþ to. Þe seueþe heste is þus, I-wis: Coueyte þou not þi nei?ebors godis. Þis two hestes acordyng ben To þo bifore as ?e may sen, Þer he seiþ to þe in hi?e “Do no þefþe, ne lecherie,” ffor he þat haþ wikked wille and smert, Wikked entent is in his hert, He may not longe for no þing Holden him from mis-doing. Þerfore I warne þe nou so, Þat þou lecherie ne do; ?if þou wolt not stele nou, Oþur mennes good coueite not þou. Þeos ben þe ten hestes to say Þat god ?af Moyses in þe Mount of Synay. Þe furste þreo, witeþ hit wel, Ben to godus honour eueridel; And to þi-self longen þe seuene, To louen alle cristene euene. Þe seuen vertues of god.

Seuen werkes of mercy. Afftur schaltou wite redili W?uche ben seuen werkes of Merci. Þe furste is, ?iue þe hungri mete; Þat oþur, drinke þe þrusti to gete; Þe þridde, cloþe þe naked bi tymes; Þe ffeorþe, to herborwe pilgrymes; Þe ffyfþe, prisons to visyte swete; Þe Sixte is, cumforte þe seke; Þe seueþe, in certeyn place we rede, Þat is to helpe burie þe dede.— Þen maistou sey in tour and toun: “I þat am in Religioun, I naue no pouwer to ?iue no mete, Ne drinke ne herborwe to hem gete, Ne cloþing to hem haue I non, To visite prisones may I not gon: I am in oþur monnes pouwer; Þerfore me were beter seculer, Þat I mihte do trewely Alle þeose dedes of Mercy.” Þenk not þus, I rede þe, Leste þou her-Inne deseyued be. Betere hit is to þe in eueri toun To haue pite and compassioun In þyn herte in alle weyse Of hem þat þou seost in Meseyse, Þen þou heddest al þe world wiþ þe Hit forth to dele for charite. ?if þi-self, as I sei nou, And more þen al þe world ?iuestou ffor þei þat suffre in alle wyse Chele, hungur, defaute and Miseise, Ihesu seiþ wher-so he go And him-self he clepeþ þo; Þus he seiþ in his gospel— Hose wol hit seche, may fynde hit wel: “What to þe leste of myne don be, ?e hit don al to me.” Wheþer weor beter or more sen To Iuge or elles Iugged to ben? Þerfore to pore make þe liche, ffor þe pore schul Iugge þe riche; As vr lord seiþ feire and wel In his owne goode gospel: “?e þat alle þynges haue to proue, Leueþ hem for me and for my loue, And at þe grete day of dome, Whon I schal sitten in my trone— ffor þere þo men schul me se In þe Seete of my Maieste— Þei schul sitte on twelf seges wel And Iugge þe twelf kuyndes of Israel.” Wheþer weore hit better at þe leste Haue heuene in possession or in bi-heste? ffor þus seiþ God, witeþ wel, In his holy Godspel: “Blesset mote þe pore of spirit be, ffor heoren is heuene,” as I sei þe. He seiþ not þus in his steuen Heoren “schal beo” þe kyngdam of heuen, But he hem doþ to vndurstonde Þei ben in possessiun and in honde. Seint Bernard in a sarmoun seiþ euen: “Þe pore naþ not in erþe, ne riche in heuen.” And ?if þe riche wol heuene haue, At þe pore he mot hit buye and craue.— Nou is hit good for to sen W?uche þat verreylich pore ben, And also þulke oþere iliche W?uche þei ben, þat ben cleped riche. Summe ben þat han riches þikke And hem louen wiþ al heor witte: Þo ben þis riche gredi men, And euer coueyten þe world þen. Oþur þer ben in dede and þou?t Wolde be riche, but þei may nou?t; ffor and þei hadden worldus good, Þei wolden hit loue as þei were wod: Þulke ben þeose, soþ to telle, Þe caytyf beggers þat nou?wher wol dwelle, But euer þei reyken aboute to craue, Al þat þei seon þei wolde hit haue; Also wiþ hem sette we moun Þis fals folk of Religioun. Þeos ben as riche in vnquerte As þeos oþure and as proude of herte; Crist spekeþ of hem in þe gospelle And þus þe wordus doþ he telle: “A Chamayle mihte beter pase Þorwh anelde y?e þenne in case, Þen miht such a riche mon In heuene come to þat kyndom.” Summen þat richesse is to brouht, Han hit, but þei louen hit nouht, But neuerþeles, þe soþ to saue, ffayn þei ben riches to haue: Þos ben þese, to seye ow here, Þe goode men of þe world so dere, Þat al heore richesse wol dispende ffor loue of god þat hit sende. Bote þe more harm is forþi, Suche ben fewe, witerli! Oþur þer ben, soþ hit is, Þat haue not of þis worldus blis Ne no þing þerof doþ craue Ne nolde not, þauh þei? mihte, hit haue: Þis ben holy religious þerfore And oþure, þat mai wel beo cald pore; Heoren is þe Ioye euerlastonde Wiþ god and wiþ godus sonde. Þen may we here-of nou say: “Blesset beo þe pore in spirit ay, ffor heoren is þe kyndom Þer as dwelleþ God and Mon.” Þenne drede we on þat oþur syde Leste þe wariing hem bi-tyde, To þis ilke riche men, Leste þei schulle in helle bren. Pore þei ben in heor herte Þat ben pore and louen pouerte, And þei ben pore in querte Þat han riches and louen pouerte. [XXXIII.] þe visions of seynt poul wan he was rapt in to paradys. Lustneþ, lordynges, leof and dere, ?e þat wolen of þe sonday here! Þe sonday a day hit is Þat angeles and archaungeles Ioyen, I-wis, More in þat ilke day Þen eny oþur, as I þe say. Þen wol we her ate dwelle Ho preyed furst rest for soules in helle. Þat is to witen, I sei þe so, Poul and Michel Archaungel bo. ffor god of his grete miht Þe peynes of helle put in heore siht. Poul sayh bi-foren helle ?ates Brennynge tres þat neuer slakes; Mony on for heore synne þonne Weore I-pyned and honged þer-onne: Summe bi hondes and bi feet þere, Summe bi þe her, summe bi þe ere, Summe bi þe Armes þat weore longe, And summe þer hengen bi þe tonge. He sau? a caudren brennynge at enes Of diuerse colours wiþ seue lemes, And þer weore þei for heore synne Diuersliche I-pynet þer-Inne; And seuen peynes weoren þer also Þat duden þe soules muche wo: Þe furste of snou?, þe secunde of ys, Þe þridde fuir in alle wys, Þe ffeorþe blod, as I þe say, Þe ffyfþe Eddres of foul aray, Þe sixte leyt, as mon may þink, Þe seueþe peyne hit was of stynk. At þat penaunces were þei in cast, Synful soules, and al for-þrast, Þe w?uche þat nolden in no chaunce ffor heore synnes do no penaunce; Þer weore þei turmented in þo ledes, And vche reseyued aftur his deedes. Summe wepten and ?elled þenne, Summe gouleden, and summe dude brenne; Þei disireden euere to dye— Hit miht not beo, wiþ-outen ly?e, ffor þe soule, wher-so hit go, Schal neuer dyen, for weole nor wo. Þerfore sore hit is to drede Þe places of helle for wikkedhede! In þe w?uche þer is a whel brennynge, Wiþ muche serwe euer-lastynge; Vndur þat wheol is þer þore A þousund grisly peynes sore, ffyue tyme vche day, to telle, Beo turmented wiþ þe Angel of helle, In vche of þo fyue tymes Ben a þousund soules turmented in pynes. Aftur þat sayh he, þer he stod, A wondur orible grisly flod, And in þat flod say he þere Mony deueles bestes were: As ffissches þei were in þat flod þo, Todus, Neddres, Snakes, mony mo, And þe synful soules in hi? Eten and gnowen wiþ-outen merci— Of hem tok I no more kep But as a Lyun doþ of a schep. Ouer þat watur he say? ligge A wondur long and an hei? brugge, And ouer þat brugge saf goon þen Þe soules of good rihtful men Wiþ-outen harm of word or dede, And also wiþ-outen eny drede. Þe soules of synne[r]s, as I þe telle, ffallen doun þer, in pyne to dwelle, Þer to take and resseyue so As þei on eorþe deserueden to. Be war of þis, I sei, beo-fore, As God seide in þe gospel þore: Ligate per fasciculos ad comburendum:Byndeþ hem in knucchenus forþi, To brenne, lyk to licchi, Spous-brekers wiþ lechours, Rauisschers wiþ rauisschours, Wikked wiþ wikked also, ffor so schul þei to-gedere go. ffor eueri creature go schal Bi þat brugge sum or al, And lasse or more schal he be deruet, Er aftur he haþ heer deseruet. Þer sauh þe goode mon poule In þat pyne moni diuerse soule: Summe to þe kne, and summe to þe hipes, Summe to þe nauel, summe to þe lippes, And summe he sau? bi-suyled as souwes In þat pyne vp to þe brouwes; And þei weore turmented euerlastyngly, Þei wept and gouled and weore sory. And Poules herte was so sor Þat for serwe he wepte þor. And of þat Angel asked he Whi summe were þer in to þe kne. Þe Angel seide to him þen: “Heo ben Bacbyters of men, Þat in word and dede, as I þe say, Hyndren heor euencristen þat þei may. And þo þat to þe nauel þou se, Spousbrekers and lechours þei be, Þat aftur heore dedes, to vndurstonde, Nolde no penaunce take on honde. And þo þat weren up to þe lippes blake, Stryf and Iangelyng in chirche dude make, Vche to oþur Iangled wiþ scorn— To heere godus wordus þei han forborn. And þo þat weren vp to þe bri?es In þat flod aboue þe ei?es, Þulke weore glade of þe mischeef Of heore neih?ebors and of heore greef.” And Poul wepte and seide þo: “Muche wo is hem I-come to Þat so mony peynes grymme Ben ordeynt to for heore synne!” Seynt Poul þo bi-tornd his face And say? anoþur derk place, Moni Men and wymmen þer amongus Þat for-freten heore owne tonges. And Poul asked of him þere What-maner men þat þei were. Þe Aungel seide to him ful sleih: “Þei vsuden Ocur and vsuri; Merciable weore þei nouht, Þerfore hit schal be dere abouht.” And Poul sau? þenne a-noþur plas, Þat moni peynes þer-in was; Þer he sauh dispitous þing: As Blake Maydens in Blac cloþing, And þei sodun euerichon In wellyng pich and Brumston; Brennyng dragouns and serpentes ifere Hongynge aboute heor nekkes were, Gnawyng hem, to don hem schom, To-tere þe fflesch from þe bon. And þer weore foure Angeles to telle Þat weoren of þe hous of helle, Brennynge hornes hedde þei on hed; Þei hem turmented and dude hem qued, ffaste þei wente þis pepul a-boute Wiþ moni turmentes grete and stoute, Seying to hem, as was heore wone: “Knoweþ ?e,” þei seide, “godus sone, Þe w?uche þat muche on ?ou þou?t, Al þe world whon he bou?t? ffor ?e nolde neuer knowen him ?e schullen han here þeos pynes grym.” Poul þis asked feire and wel. And þenne onswered þe Aungel: “Þeos serued not chastite Til tyme of heor weddynge schulde be, But lyuede in heore lecherie, And heled heore children and dude hem dye And ?af hem to swyn or to houndes Or drouned hem In flodes groundes, And schewed hem to þe worldus degre As þei maydens hedden i-be; And in þis lyf þei lyueden ?ore And duden no penaunce þerfore.” Aftur þis he say? at ene Men and wymmen moni and lene, Lene þei weore, wiþ-outen flesche; Þei soffred harde and noþing nessche: Muche lay bi-foren hem of Mete Þat hem deynet not of to ete. Þo weore þeose þat weore not trewe And nolde not faste þat hem was duwe, And hedden of mony metes dedeyn, But hit weore likerous, be certeyn. Þen sau? poul a serw?ful siht— And he loked þer forþ riht: An Old mon sat þer wepynge Bi-twene four deueles foul ?ellynge. Poul asked what he was. And þe Angel seide in plas: “He was Neclygent a?eynes forbod And kepte not þe lawes of God, He nas not chast of bodi i-sou?t Ne of herte ne of his þou?t, But euer he was Couetous, Proud of herte and contrarius; Þerof nolde he him not schriue Ne do no penaunce bi his lyue, Þerfore he schal beo pyned ay Wiþ-outen Noumbre til domus-day.” Poul wepte and bigon to goule. Þe Angel seide: “whi wepustou, poule? ?it say? þou not, as I þe telle, Þe strengest peyne þat is in helle.” Þe Angel him schewed wiþ-outen weoles A put a-seled wiþ seuen seles. He bad him stonde bac, for þat þing, Þat he mihte sustene þat stynk. He opened þe Mouþ of þat put: Hit stonk foule w?on hit was vnschut; Þe stynk þat com out of þat plas Passed al þe peynes and stinkes þer was. Þen seide þat Angel, to biginne: “Hose comeþ þis put wiþ-Inne, Bi-fore God and vre ladi Schal neuer of him beo no merci.” Poul askede: “w?uche ben þo Þat schulen to þis peyne go?” He seide: “hose leeueþ not in wone Þat Iesu crist, Godus sone, Tok fflesch and blod of þe virgine Marie And seþþe was boren of hire bodye; And also þulke, I telle hit þe, Þat neuer wollen Bapti?ed be, Þulke þat resseyue not worþily Þe flesch and blod of godus bodi.” Poul loked forþur þen And sau? ful mony men and wymmen; Wormes and serpentes on hem seeten, Euer as houndes þei on hem freeten. So mony soules þer weore in hold, Vehon on oþur, as schep in fold. Hit was also dep to nemene As from þe eorþe vp to heuene. Of heore serwyng was muche wondur, Þei made a noyse as hit weore þundur. And þenne poul loked touward heuene, And out of eorþe he herde a steuene; A synful soule he sau? comynge Among seue deueles waymentynge; Þe w?uche þat same day forþi Was itaken from þe bodi. Þe Angeles of God, þat ben vr frendes, Cri?eden faste to þe ffendes, Sey?inge allas, makynge heore mon: “What haþ þat wrecched soule i-don?” Þe ffendes seiden: “verreyment, He haþ se?en his Iuggement; He haþ ben muche mys-auyset, Godus Comaundemens he haþ dispyset, In eorþe he lyued in foly And þer dude he no remedi. His owne cha[r]tre haþ he rad Þat his synnes were Inne I-sprad, And so forþ, we telle þe, His owne self þen Iugged he.” Þen tok þe deueles and him bounde, And caste hym in to þe derkeste grounde, Þer as was wepyng wiþ muche vnseeþe, Goulyng and grisbatyng of teþe. Þen seide to poul þat Aungel: “Leeue þou hit and knowe hit wel: So as Mon doþ in his lyuing So schal he haue aftur his endyng.” Aftur þat þis was forþ so sent, In-wiþ þe space of a moment, Aungeles of heuene sai? he come þon, Brouhten þe soule of a Rihtful mon. Þer was Ioye wiþ loud steuene, ffor so þei beeren hit in to heuene; Of a þousund Angeles he herde þe vois, Ioynge wiþ a semely noys, And seiden: “murie soule, blesset þou be, ffor euer murþe schal beo wiþ þe! Þou art i-blesset of God in trone: Þe wille of Ihesu hastou done.” Þen seide þe Angeles in heore sei?ing: “Ledeþ hym vp to-foren vr kyng! Glad may he ben of alle clerkes Þat schal him-self rede his goode werkes.” Aftur þat Mihel lede him in hi? To paradys to oþur holi. A Ioyful noyse was hem among Of Angeles and Archangeles wiþ song. Þei þat in peyne bi-neþen ly?e, Herden þis and al hit sei?e; Þei ?elleden wiþ lodly cry: “Poul, Michael, on vs ha merci! Prei for vs wiþ good a-cord To vre god and to vre lord!” Þen seide þe Angel to hem þo: “Weputh! poul and I wolen also, Þat Almihti God, þat may best, Send ?ow sum refuit and sum rest.” And þeose þat in peyne weore Cried on God wiþ delful beere; Michael and poul also, And a Legioun of Aungelus mo. Þe soun of hem was herd ful euene Vp in to þe ffeorþe heuene, Sei?inge “haue merci on hem, Þe Sone of God and eke of mon.” And þenne þei þe heuene seih Open a-non ful sodeynly, Þe Sone of god com doun þo And herde hem preye, mony on mo, Þei preieden alle ful tenderli “Haue merci on vs, sone of Daui!” Þe vois þenne of vre heuene kyng Ouer al þe peynes was herd seying: “What good ha ?e don herbifore Þat ?e aske reste so sore? I was don on cros for ?ou wiþ dere And smiten wiþ a ful scharp spere, I-nayled also wiþ nayles þree, Eysel and Galle to drynke bode me; I ?af my-self for ?ou to be, ffor ?e schulde ouer come wiþ me.

Þo weore þeos, as I ow telle Þat weoren in þe pynen of helle. Þen seide vr lord to hem in spelle: “ffor Poul and also Michaelle And myn oþure Angeles on hi?e, Þat ben in heuene so goode and tri?e, And also of my grete goodnesse, Hem to ese of heore distresse, Þis rest I ?iue ?ow ful soon ffrom þe seter-day at Non Til þe secunde hour beo cum On þe Monenday, al and sum.” A non þe soules hedden þer rest— He ?af hit hem þat mihte best. Þe soules cri?ed euerichon: “Blesset beo þou, lord, sone of mon, Lord and God of Dauid kuynde! Þis rest bi þe haue we in Muynde.”— Þerfore, whos halweþ wel þe sonenday, He schal ha part of þe reste ay Þat þe Angeles in heuene Han þere wiþ mylde steuene. Beo war of þe serwe and drede And of þe peynes þat we her rede, And torne we in alle wyse Vr lord to serue, þat hi?e Iustise; Bi w?uche seruyse we may come To vre lord god and wiþ him wone. XXXIV. þe Pope trental. I-writen I fynde a good stori, Þe Pope hit wrot seint Gregori, Of his Modur and of hire lyf, Þat alle men heolden an holi hosewyf, So sad of Maner, so mylde of Mood, Þat alle men heolden hire holi and good; De-boner, deuout, so milde of steuene, Þat alle men gesset hire worþi to heuene. As holi I-holden as heo was, Þe fend ?it falled hire in a foul cas, He truyled hire wiþ his tricherye And ladde hire in to lecherye, Þat lust wiþ loue hire so be-gylede, So foule, til heo was wiþ childe. So priueliche noþeles heo hire bar Þat þer-of nas no wiht I-war. And for no wiht schulde wite hire cas, Anon as hire child I-boren was, Þe Nekke heo nom, þe child heo woriede, And a-non þe child heo buriede. Þus was heo cumbred in careful cas, Ne schewed neuer schrift þerof, allas! ffor heo wolde holy I-holde be, Heo tolde neuer prest hire priuite; Al folk fayn was of hire fame, So holy as heo was holden of name. Eft-sones hir fel þe same cas Riht as bi-foren bi-tyd hire was. ffor heo was comen of prys parage, Of riche kun, of gentil lynage, Hire sone was seynt Gregori þe pope, Men heolden hire holy wiþ al heore hope, Þerfore heo schonede hir schrift to schowe, Leste by schrift hire cas weor knowe. So schome makeþ men schone heor schrift And leose þe grace of godus ?ift, And siþen to liuen so sunfulli And sorily dyen and sodeynli. Þis wommones dedes ner not aspyet, And softly sone þer-aftur heo dyed. Whon heo was seyen so softly dye, Men hopede heo weore in heuene ful hi?e, Men heolden hir holy and so deuoute Þat of hire deþ men hedden no doute, But wenden witerly alle to-wisse Þat heo weore set in souereyn blisse. Þer-aftur wiþ-Inne a luytel tyme Vp-on a day sone aftur prime Hire sone þe pope at Masse stood, And of his Modur trouwed bote good. Al sodeynliche a-Midde his messe Þer drouh touward him such a derknesse Þat lakkede al þe dayes lyht And was derk as hit weore midniht; And in þat derknesse a myst among, Al stoneyd he was, such stunch þer stong; Þer-of so grislich he was a-gast Þat al swounyng he was al-mast. Beo-syde he loked vndur his leor: A-Midde þe derknesse þer drou? on ner A wonder grisli creature, Riht aftur a fend ferde hire feture; So Ragget, so Rent, so elyng, so vuel, As hidous to bi-holden as helle-deuel; Mouþ and Neose, Eres and E?es fflaumed al ful of furi li?es. He asked hit hei?lich: “þorwh his miht Þat alle deueles schal dreden and diht, And eke bi vertu of his blood Þat for Monkynde di?ed on Rod, Sey me a-non þe soþe soone: What hastou in þis place to done? What is þi cause, þou cursede wrecche, Þus me at Masse to derue and drecche?” Þe gost onswerde wiþ dreri cher: “I am þi Moodur þat þe beer, Þat for vn-schriuene dedes derne In bitter peynes þus i berne.” Þen onswerd þe pope: “allas, Allas, my Modur, þis wondur cas! Allas, my Modur, hou may þis be, In such aray I þe to seo? Men wenden witerli to-wisse Þou weore wel worþi to habbe blisse And þat ful wel wiþ God þou were, To preyen for us þat liuen ?it here. Sey me, modur, wiþ-outen feyne, Whi art þou put to al þis peyne?” Heo seide: “my sone, soþfastly I schal þe telle þe cause why: ffor I nas not such as I seemed, But wikked and worse þen men me demed, I sungede wikkedliche in my lyue, Of w?uch I ne dorste for schome me schriue;” Heo tolde him trewely al hire cas ffrom ende to oþur riht as hit was. “Sei me, Modur, for Marie flour, ?if ou?t may beo þi socour, Wher penaunce of fasting mai ou?t alegge, Beodes or Masses þi peynes abregge, Or eny-maner oþur þyng Þat þe mai helpe of eny lissyng?” “Mi deore Blessede sone,” seide heo, “fful wel I-holpen I mihte beo, Holpen and saued I mihte beo wel Hose vndurtoke a trewe trentel Of ten cheef festes of al þe ?er To synge for me in þis Maneer: Þreo Masses of Cristes Natiuite, And of þe Ephiphan oþur þre, Þreo of þe Purificaciun, And þreo of þe Annunciaciun, Þreo of þe Resurrexiun, And þreo of þe Ascenciun, Of þe Pentecost oþur þre, And þreo of þe holy Trinite, Þreo of Maries Natiuite, And of hire Concepcioun oþur þre”— Þeose weoren þe cheef festes ten Þat souereynliche socourde synful men. “What godmon syngeþ þeos masses, saunfayle, To synful soule þei schullen auayle, Wiþ þe ?eer wiþ-outen treyne Diliueren a soule ful out of peyne. Let sei þeos Masses bi ?oure hestes Wiþ-Inne þe vtaues of þe ffestes! And he þat schal þeos Masses do, Let sei þer-wiþ þe Orisun þer-to, Treoweliche wiþ-outen were Eueri day þorwh-out þe ?ere, Heet him sei hit eueri day, Oþur he þat doþ þe Masses to say.” Hose wol knowe þis orisun clene, Hit is on Englisch þus muche to mene: “God, vr verrey Redempciun, Oracio Vr soþfast soules sauaciun, Þat chose al oþur londes bi-forn Þe lond of bi-heste In to beo born, And þi deþ suffredest in þat same, Diliuere þis soule from gult and blame, Tak hit out of þe fendes bond, And þat lond from þe heþene hond, And peple þat leueþ not in þe Þorwh þi vertu amendet mote be; And alle þat trusteþ In þi Merci, Lord, saue hem sone and soþfastli!” “A Modur,” he seide, “þat wol I do, ffor I am mon most I-holde þer-to— Þou weore my Modur, I was þi sone— To synge þe Masses I schal not schone; God graunte me, Modur, þe stonde in stede A?eynes þe synnes þat euer þou dude. I halse þe hei?liche, Modur deere, Þis tyme twelf-Moneþ to me a-peere, Hol þin a-stat to me þou schowe, Þat, hou þou fare, I mouwe wel knowe!” “Mi sone,” heo seide, “I wole, in ffey,” And wiþ þat word heo wente hir wey. So day from day þe ?er con passe, Þe pope for-lette neuer his Masse Þe same dayes þat weoren asignet, To helpen his Modur þat was so pynet, And tok þe Orisun al-gate þer-to Als, as his Modur prei?ede him do. Þat tyde twelf-Moneþ at Masse he stod Holyliche wiþ deuociun good: And in þat same tyde apliht He say? a swiþe selli siht, A comeli ladi, so dresset and diht Þat al þe world of hire schon briht, Comeli Corouned as a Qweene, Tweyn Angeles ladden hire hem bi-twene. He was so Rauischt of þat siht, Al-most for Ioye he swounede riht. He fel doun flat bi-foren hire feet, Þe teres of his e?en he doun leet, He grette hire wiþ wel mylde steuene And seyde: “ladi, Qween of heuene, Moodur of Ihesu, Mylde Marie, ffor my moodur Merci I crie.” “[D]o wey,” heo seide, “I nam not heo Ne whom þou wenest þat I beo, Bote, soþlyche, as þou seost me her, I am þe Moodur þat þe beer. Bi-foren i ferde, þou wustest wel, ffarynge as a fend of hel, I am nou such as þou sest her, Þorwh help and vertu of þi preyer, ffrom derknesse i-dresset to blisse cleer. Þe tyme beo blesset þat I þe beer! And for þe kuyndenesse of þi deede Souereyn Ioye schal beo þy Meede. And alle þat leteþ þeos Masses þus do, Schul saue hem-self and soules also. Þerfore, Sone, þis storie þou preche! Mi dere sone, god I þe be-teche.” Whon heo hedde endet þis wordes euene, Angeles token hire hom to heuene. Þe same hom to god vs sende, To wone wiþ him wiþ-outen ende. Amen. Trentale sancti gregorij. The following, reprinted from ms. Cotton Caligula A II, is an alternative version of the Pope Trental. A nobull story wryte y fynde, A pope hit wrote to haue yn mynde, Of his modur &amp; of her lyf That holden was an holy wyfe, Of myrthes sadde &amp; mylde of mode, Þat all men held her holy &amp; gode; Bothe deuowte &amp; mylde of steuen, Þat all men helde her wordy heuen. So holy as she was holde of name, All men were gladde of her fame. But as holy as she holden was, Þe deuell brow?th her yn a foule cas, He trifeled her so with his trecherye And ledde her yn lust of lecherye, ffor with lust of lecherye he her begylde Tyll she hadde conceyued a chylde. And also priuely she hit bare That þer-of was no man ware. And for no mon shuld wyte of þat case, Anone as þe chylde born was, The chylde she slow? &amp; wyryede And pryuely she hit byryede. Þer was she combred yn a carefull case, And vnshryuen þer-of she was; She ne tolde no preste her priuyte ffor she wolde holy holden be. Efte-sones she fell in þe same case Ry?th as beforn her be-tydde was. ffor she was comen of hy? parage, Of gentyll kynne &amp; worþy lynage, Þerfor she wolde not her synne shewe Nor yn schryfte hit be-knowe, And so her dedes wer not a-spyed. But afturwarde sodenly she dyed. When she was seyn so sodenly dye, Men hoped she was yn heuen hye; They helde her so holy &amp; deuowte Þat of her deth þey made no dowte, But sykurly men wende y-wys Þat she was worþy heuen blys. Then aftur with-Inne a shorte tyme, Vpon a day soone aftyr pryme, The pope as he at his masse stode, Vpon his modur he hadde þow?t goode, Prayng to god with conciens clere The soþe to knowe as hit were. And sodenly yn myddes his masse Þer þrow? to hym such a derkenesse Þat he lakkede ner þe dayes ly?t, ffor hit was derke as mydny?t; In þat derkenes was myste among, All a-stonyed he stode so hit stongke. Be-syde he loked vnþur hys lere: In þat derknes a þyng þrew hym nere, A wonþurfull grysely creature, Aftur a fend fyred with all her feture, All ragged &amp; rente, boþe elenge &amp; euell, As orrybull to be-holde as any deuell; Mowthe, face, eres &amp; yes Brennede all full of brennyng lyes. He was so agast of þat grysyly goste That yn a swonyng he was almoste. He halsed hit: “þorow goddes my?te That þe fende he putte to fly?te, And be þe vertu of hys blode That for mankynde dyed on Rode, Sey me sykerly þe soþe soone What þou hast yn þis place to done; What ys þy cause, þou cursed wreche, Thus at masse me for to drecche?” Þe gost answered with drury chere: “I am þy modur þat þe beere, Þat for vnschryuen dedes so derne In byttyr paynes þus y brenne.” Then sayde þe pope: “alas, alas! Modur, þis ys to me a wondur case. A, leef modur, how may þis be In suche paynes þe for to se? ffor all men wende y-wys That þou hadde ben wordy heuen blys, And full good þat þou were, To praye for vs þat ben here. Sey me, modyr, with-outen fayne, Why art þou put to all þis payne?” She sayde: “sone, sykerly, I shall þe telle þe cause why: ffor y was not such as y semed, But myche worse þen men wened; I lyuede in lustes wykkydly in my lyfe, Of þe whyche y wolde me not shryfe;” And tolde hym trewly all þe case ffro þe bygynnyng how þat hit wase. The pope lette teres a-down Renne, And to his modyr he sayde þen: “Tell me now, modur, for loue of mary flour, If any þyng may þe help or sokour, Bedes or masse, þy penaunce to bye, Or ony fastyng, þy sorowe to aleye; What crafte or caste or any oþur þyng The may help or be þy Releuyng?” “My blessed sone,” sayde she, “ffull well y hope þat hit may be; Syker &amp; saf my?th y be well Who-so trewly wolde take a trentell Of ten chef festes of þe ?ere, To syng for me yn þis manere: Thre masses of crystys natyuyte, And of þe xij day oþur þre, Thre of our ladyes puryfycacion, And oþur þre of her Annunciacion, Thre of crystes gloryous Resurreccion, And oþur þre of his hy?

Who-so sayth þese masses, with-out fayle, ffor sy?full sowles þey shall a-vayle; All a ?ere, with-outen trayne, They delyuere a sowle out of payne. Lette say þese masses be ?our hestes With-Inne þe vtas of þe festes! And he þat shall þese masses do, Sey he þer-with þis oryson also: Deus qui es nostra Redempcio, With all þe oþur þat longen þer-to.” The pope was gladde her-of in fay, And to his modur þen gon he say: “Modyr,” he sayde, “þis shall be do, ffor y am moste bounde þerto— Thou were my modur, I was þy sone— Thys same ?ere hit shall be done; God graunte me grace to stonde in stede A?eyns all þe synnus þat euur þou dede. I commaunde hooly, my moder dere, Þat þis tyme twelfmoneþ þou to me apere, And hooly to me þy state þou telle, That how þou fare y may wyte well.” “My sone,” she sayde, “y woll yn fay,” And with þat worde she wente her way. Day by day þe ?er gon passe, The pope for-?ate neuur his masse The same dayes þat were a-syned, To helpe his modur þat was pyned, And toke þe orysons all-way þer-to Ry?th as she bad hym for to do. xij moneþ aftur as he at masse stode With gret deuocion &amp; holynesse gode, At þat same tyme full Ryght He sawe a full swete syght: A comely lady dressed &amp; dyght, That all þe worlde was not so bry?t, Comely crowned as a qwene, Twenty Angellys her ladde be-twene. He was so Raueshed of þat syght That ny? for Ioye he swoned Ryght. He fell down flatte by-fore her fete, Þat deuowtly teres wepynge he lete, And grette her with a mylde steuen And sayde þere: “lady, qwene of heuen, Modyr of Ihesu, mayde marye, ffor my modyr mercy I crye.” At þat worde with mylde chere She hym answered on þis manere: “Blessed sone, I am not she Who wenest þou þat I be, But certes as þou seest me here I am þy modyr þat þe bere, That her-by-fore, þou wyste well, I was wordy payne yn hell, And now y am such as þou seest her, Þorow help of þe vertu of þy prayer, ffro derknesse I dresse to blysse clere; Þe tyme be blessed þat y þe bere! And for þe kyndenesse of þy good dede Heuen-blysse shall be þy mede. And all þo þat leten þese masses be do, Shall saue hem-self &amp; oþur mo; Þus may þey helpe her frendes all That Reche-lesly yn synne falle. Therfore, sone, þis story þou preche!

Thys ys þe vertu, y þe telle, Of seynt gregory trentelle. But who so wyll do hit trewely, He moste do more, sykurly: Þe preste þat þe masse shall synge, At eche feste þat he doþ hit mynge He moste say with good deuocion) Ouer Euen) þe commendacyon), Placebo &amp; dyryge also, The sowle to brynge out of woo; And also þe salmus seuene, ffor to brynge þe sowle to heuen— Among oþur prayeres þey ben good To brynge sowles fro helle f[l]ode, ffor euery psalme qwencheth a synne, As ofte as a man þoth hem) mynne.

[XXXV. þe Spore of Loue.] Her beginneþ þe Prikke of loue, Þat profitable is to soule be-houe. God þat art of mi?tes most, ffader and Sone and holigost, Þow graunte hem alle þi blessyng Þat herken wel to þis talkyng. ffor, lewed and lered, more and lesse, Hit wol ow teche holynesse; To loue God wiþ fyn chere Hit wol ou teche, my leoue and dere. ffor mony a tyme ?e cone me preye Þer-of a lesson ow to seye; ?oure dulnesse sum what to scharpe ?e han me preyed for to carpe. ffor bisynes of wordli þing To monye hit is a gret lettyng, And eke ?or owne frelete, Þat makeþ ow ?eore heui to be Of or-self and ?oure liuinge, Þorw þe ffendes entysynge. Þerfore þis bok to ow I make ?oure discumfort for to slake, Þat is cald “þe spore of loue,” Þat stureþ or loue to god aboue. Riht as þe spore makeþ hors to renne, So schal þis bok sone god ou kenne, Þat is souereyn holynesse. ?e schul fynde heer-in swetnesse: Loke ?e take herto good hede! ffor I schal telle ?ou, as I rede. Þis may be ?or halyday werk, Hit wol a-vayle boþe lewed and clerk. Of Meditacion of þi-self knowyng. Takeþ good hede, of alle þinge Þis tweyne to loue, good þei wil þe bringe: Þe ffurste Is Meditacion, Þe toþer is Contemplacion; Þenk of þi-self þat is to say, And on God, eueriche day. Þou mai?t not loue God ri?t wel But ?if þou knowe him furst sumdel, Ne þi-self neuer þe more. Þat God is best wite wel þerfore; And wene not þi-self be best, Al þi while þen hast þou lost. Þi-self loke þat þou knowe, ffor þat schal make þe Meke &amp; lowe And able to knowe þe grete bounte Of God þat sitteþ in Maieste. Bi-þenk þe þenne, whil þou hast quart, In Bodi and Soule what þou art. Þi bodi was gendred of foul matere, Þat is wlatsum for to here. Bi al þin Issuwes hit is wel sene Þat þou art not wiþ-Inne ful clene. Nyne Issuwes þou hast, I wene, ?if þou loke hem al bi-deene: Tweyne Eren þou hast, ben ful of wore, Þyn E?en ben goundi whon þei ben sore, Þi Neose-þurles ben ful of snit, And þi Mouþ of glet and spit, Þyn Issuwes þat aren in priuete ffor schome þou letest no mon hem se. Þerfore, seint Bernard as he vs telles: Þou proude mon, þou art nou?t elles But of Muk bretful a sekke; Mon, schuldest þou not so muche rekke Of þi-self þen of anoþer, ffor Rot is þi ffader, worm þi broþer, ffor gendred he is riht of þe same As þou. Proud mon, þou art to blame, Þat þow berest þe so stoutli And hast þow non enchesun whi! Heddest þow be maad of stones riche, Sonne or Mone or bodi heuenliche, How nobliche þow heddest be wrou?t! As Lucifer þow mi?test haue þou?t. Of his beute proud he was: Þerfore him tidde a wel foul cas, In heuene he durede but a while. Riht so pruide wol þe be-gyle And caste þe doun riht to grounde, Þi soule in peyne hit schal be bounde. Þi bodi, þat now is hol and sounde, So foul rot hit schal be founde, Hit schal not turne to gras nor flour, But in to wlatsum and foul odour. Þus mai?t þou knowe þi bodily staate, Þi fleschli lust forto abate. Meditacion of þe Soule. Of þi soule ?it þenke þow What staat hit is Inne now, And what þou hast don her-bi-foren— Or elles þou mai?t sone be loren. Þenk hou muche wikkednesse Þou hast don, and [left] goodnesse, How luitel good þow hast wrou?t, Þi tyme hast spendet aboute nou?t; Of werk and word þat is gon And of þi tyme schal leue riht non Þat þou ne schalt ?elde ful streit acounte, Þou nost hou muche hit wol amounte. ?if þou weore bounde for to telle exemplum In þe séé þe smale grauelle, Or sterres in þe ffirmament, Þow heddest gret neode, verrement, fforto a-vise þe wonder wel! So most þou rikene eueridel Werk, and word, and þou?tes alle, Þat ben wel mo þen grauel smalle; And of þi tyme þat is past. Þerof þou mai?t ben sore agast To þenke þus what þi soule haþ ben! What hit is now, is good to sen. So chaungeable is þi soule, my frende, Þat nou?t þe pleset adai to þe ende; Now art þow sori, now art þow glad, Now art in hope, now art adrad; ?it wilnest þow þing þat neuer ne was. Þou art more frele þen is þe glas: Wiþ-oute touche hit lasteþ ay, Þi soule is frelore atte assay: Þorw siht wiþ-oute &amp; þou?t wiþ-Inne Hit may be broken, wiþ dedly synne. Þerto assentest þou lihtly, And for to be fondet þou art redi, And forte wiþ-stonde hastou no mi?t, But þorw þe grace of god almiht, Þat kepeþ þe vp whon þou schuldest falle. ffrom mony mischeues he con þe calle: Whon þou art loren he þe fyndes, Of Bondus of synne he þe vnbyndes; To þe deuel whon we were sold, He Raunsound vs, boþe ?onge &amp; old; Dedly synne whon þou hast don, He vengeþ him not þer-on anon, But Corteisliche he þe abydes; Þi schome &amp; synne ?it he hydes. He blames þe whon þou dost mys, And euere he techeþ þe, I-wys, In hungur &amp; þurst he þe fedes, Among þin enymys he þe ledes, In hete and chele he þe refresches, Slepyng, wakyng he þe redresses. Heron þou þenke boþe Euen &amp; morn! And eke, hou mony men han be lorn, Boþe be water and londe also, Þat God ne haþ not tendet to As to þe so bisyli. And þerfore sei, “sire, graunt Merci,” Whon þow be-þenkest þe day or niht Hou god þe kepeþ wiþ-oute dispit In Bodi or soule, erli or late.— Þus mai?t þou knowe þin owne astate. To loue god bi alle resoun ffor þis fordede þou hast enchesoun. Þis þou?t is Meditacion. Now forþ to Contemplacion. Of Contemplacion in creature. Contemplacion is to seye: Siht of god and his nobleye. Þat mai?t þou se be þin Inwit In creature, and in holy writ, And siþen in his owne kynde. Of þeose ?if we wol haue good mynde, Þe nobleye of god [we se] in his werkes, As men mowe seo, Lewed &amp; Clerkes. Þou þat neuere se?e Duyk Henri, Þat þe newe werk of Leycetre reised on hi?: Þer-bi mai?t þou wel wyte and se Þat he was lord of gret pouste Þat hit made of his owne cost— I hope he naue þeron not lost. Þe makyng of vche a creature Such is godes mi?t wiþ-oute Mesure. And bi þe ordre of vch a kynde His wit we sen but we be blynde; And bi þe creatures meyntenyng Of his godnes we han witeryng. So long and Brod as is þis world, Hei? and dep, scheweþ him a lord Of Miht and pouwer gret saun?faile, Al made of nou?t wiþ-oute trauayle. Eyr &amp; ffuir on hei? ben founde, Water and Erþe heuy at grounde: Of his wisdam hit scheweþ a part, And so to Ioyne hem a ful gret art. Hedde fuir and water to-geder ben set, Not wysli don men wolden han let, Þat On þat oþer wolde distruye; Hedde Eir be Ioyned to eorþe so druye, Hit wolde for chyne, for to seye soþ, No fruit wolde bere as hit now doþ. Water and Erþe are meynt to-gidere, ffor grene þing schulde not al to-whidere. Gret wit and wisdam, as I ow tolde In God ?it ?e may be-holde: How summe creaturs al-on Han beoynge of him, as stok and ston; And summe, as treo and gras and flour, Han lyf, but Ioye non ne no dolour; Summe ben &amp; liuen &amp; fleon lykyng, As Beest and ffoul and ffisch fletyng; Ouer alle þeose Mon bereþ þe pris, ffor he haþ reson to make him wys— Þat makeþ hym peringal lo here To Angeles of heuene, to ben heor feere. So muche may ?it be monnes grace Þat he mai passen an Angeles place. Seynt Austyn, þe grete clerk, seiþ ri?t so: An Angeles place he wolde for-go ffor to haue þe worþi stede Þat God haþ ordeynd for Monhede. Herof I rede þou take good keepe! Elles þou art worþi gret schendschip, But þou lyue aftur þi degre, Seþþe þou hast such a dignite Alle þing to beo þin vnderloute, A-boue, bi-neþe, and al aboute. ffor al þing in eorþe, mon, in sum wyse Was maad of god for þi seruyse: Hors &amp; Neet and eke Chamayle, Þe to ese in þi trauayle; Lyn, fforre, fflax, Selk and Wolle, Þat diuersliche God ?eueþ at folle, Þe to kepe from chele and hete; Beest, fisch &amp; foul, &amp; fruit, to þi mete. Þe þinkeþ par aunter hit is not so, ffor venymous bestes þei don vs wo. Þe harmful creatures, verrement, Weore maad til vre amendement, Þei ben to vs a Chastisyng, And eke a wel feir techyng. Whil þou hast in þin hond a ?erd, exemplum Þe Child þer-of is sore aferd, Of his vnti?t ful sone slakes And to his lore good keep he takes; Hit makeþ þe child boþe meke &amp; lowe, A-Mendeþ him wel him-self to knowe. Þe venymous beestes wel muche we dreden: Þe beter þerfore vre lyf we leden. ffor summe to vs þei beo nuyouse, Godes werk we knowe ful meruilouse— Of Godes wisdam a wonder cast! But of his goodnes be-hold atte last, How Creatures þat ben Iure, Þe Sky, Heuen, Sterres and heore nature God haþ maad forte mowe endure Euermore wiþ-outen eny gendrure; But þulke on eorþe eueri day þei rote, As on is ded, anoþur is gote— Such vertu in kuynde God con faste, Þat longe I-nowh so mihte þei laste, ?if his wille were for euere and ay; So multiplye þei euer vche a day, Þat summe ben olde &amp; summe be newe, Þorw þe godnesse of his vertue.— Þus mowe ?e knowe boþe more &amp; lesse Godes Mi?t, his wit, and his goodnesse In creatures, as I haue told, How gret, how good, how monifold. Seþþe he haþ maad for vs al þis, But we him loue we don amis. ?if þow loue ?iftes in þin entent, Loue him wel raþer þat hit þe sent, Þat is god al þing aboue. Þerfore me þinkeþ we schulde him loue; And for him-self ?it wel more, Whon we be-þenken vs of þis lore. Þis þe furste Contemplacioun In Creatures of gret Renoun.— Þe secunde contemplacion In holy writ. Þe secunde contemplacion is hit Þat I seide, in holi writ. Þei þow be lewed and con not rede, Noþeles ful wel ?it may þou spede To herkene þe ffrere Sarmounyng And oþer priue Carpyng, And loke ?if þou mowe ou?t þer lere Þin vnderstondyng to make more clere. Þer mai?t þow lerne, as I trowe, Good from vuel for to knowe, Sinne to hate, vertu to loue, And to ?erne þe Ioye aboue, Þe pyne of helle for to drede, Nou?t loue þis world but for þi nede; Alle þinges þat we of prechen, Summe of þeos poyntes forsoþe þei techen. Þerfore I prey ?ou, takeþ good hede After holi writ ?oure lyf to lede, Godes wille so to knowe þer-Inne Þat ?e mowe hate dedly sinne. And þat ?e mowe knowe w?uch hit bene, I schal hem riken alle bedene, And þe spices þat of hem launches. Pride þe furste, haþ six Braunches: Þe furste is cald vnbuxomnes: Of herte hit is a gret hi?nes, Makeþ mon to leeten þat him is boden And to don þat is forboden Of God or Mon, his ouerlyng. Þe secounde spice is Bostyng, Þat makeþ mon forto him auaunte Of good þat he wolde neuere haunte. Þe þridde spice is Ypocrisye— Schewest þe beter to Monnes ei?e Þen þou art þi-self wiþ-Inne, And leetest as þou heddest neuer do synne. Þe feorþe is clept Arrogaunce, Þat schewes oþur mennes mischaunce And openeþ al out heore wikkednes, So þat þyn may seme þe les; Of oþer mennes schendschipe To þe þow takest worschipe. Þe ffyfþe spice, hit is dispyt, Oþer menne goodnes setteþ luit, Þow seist hit is not worþ a Bore, So þat þin may seme þe more. Þe Sixte is cald Elacion, Boldnesse of vuel þat þou hast don; Þat makeþ mon for to fonde Correxion hou he may wiþ-stonde. Þeos ben þe spices most comuyn of pride, Þat spreden in þis world ful wyde. Pruide in heuene furst bi-gon, And seþþen in eorþe to mony a Mon. Of þeos þreo þinges as I schal telle, Of Pruide moni on haþ þe smelle: Of godes of kuynde, or of grace, Or elles of worldes purchace. Strengþe, feirnesse, good wit, or kynne Bi kynde þis mon haþ him wiþ-Inne; ffeiþ, Hope, Loue and Charite Goodes of grace þei ben, parde; ffeir Cloþes, Lond, Hous and Rent Worldes purchase ben, verrement. Of þeos þreo þinges pruide is born, Þat makeþ mony a mon to be forlorn. Þe secunde synne, hit is Envy: Of oþur mennes wele hit is sori, And of heor harm hit is fayn. Þreo spices hit haþ, as men sayn: In herte hit is furst, þorw vuel wille; In word: þi nei?ebor Bakbyte and spille; In werk, hit makeþ lered and lewed To his nei?ebor forte beo schrewed. Wraþþe to þi soule Is mischaunce— Of þi nei?ebor hit wilneþ veniaunce; ?if þou in herte bere hit longe, Hattreden hit engendreþ swiþe stronge. Herof comeþ cheste and Manasyng, Vileynous wordes, and eke grucching, Discord, Repref, deynous lokyng— Þeos ben alle a foul ofspring. Þe ffeorþe is slouþe in godes seruise. Þe Braunches þerof I wol deuyse: Þe furste is feyntise wiþ-oute likyng, Þat makeþ þe heui wiþ alle þing; Þat toþer is a tendernesse, Þat suffreþ no disese nor duresse; Recheleschipe is þe þridde— Þou takest no kep what men þe bidde; Þe feorþe is called Idelnesse, Whon þou ne wolt worche, more ne lesse. Þe ffyfþe is cald Auarice, Þat haþ mony a sori spice: Þerof comeþ treson, and Robberie, fforsweryng, Oker, and Symonye, Þefþe, Beryng of fals witnesse, Ly?ing, and of herte hardnesse, Þat makeþ þe no reuþe to haue Of hem þat þe good craue. Glotonye is þe Sixte synne, Þat fouleþ mon wiþ-oute and wiþ-Inne. Þe furste spice is of glotenye To ete more þen þou may?t defye, Whon þou art in hele nomeli; Anoþer is to ete to lustili. Glotonye makeþ mon in hast To breke holychirche fast. Þe þridde makeþ bisili to þenche What maner of mete his lust may quenche. Þe feorþe, þat makeþ mon as ded, Þat is foul drounkenhed— Þat is dedly, bi enchesoun Þat hit bi-reueþ mon his resoun; But ?if hit come wiþ-oute fayle Of feble brayn or gret trauayle, Or þe drinke be strengor þen men wenen, ffor venial synne we hit demen. Lecherie is on of þe seuene, Þat greueþ muche vr lord of heuene. In to þis synne whon tweyne falle Þat ben sengle, is lest of alle; But ?if þe wommon a Mayde be, Worse is þat, þe secounde degre; Þe þridde is clept Holorie, Þat wedlak brekeþ, is synne ful hye; Incest þe ferþe, whon þou lyst bi Þi gostly kyn or bodili; Þe worste of alle is Sodomye, Vn-kyndely synne, foul Ribaudye— Þerfore haþ God taken gret wreche. Of dedly synne her endeþ my speche. Of þe Seuene blessynges of þe gospel, Seuene dedli Synnes remedie. But of heore remedies nou wol I telle Þat crist seiþ in þe holi gospelle. Þo ben þe benisouns seuene; A?eyn þeose synnes þei ben ful euene. “Þe Meke of spirit þei ben blest, ffor heoren is þe Ioye þat euer schal last:” Þis Blessyng a?eyn pride is riht, Þat be-reueþ mon God almi?t. “Þe Mylde beþ blessed þat loueþ no strif, ffor þei schul haue þe lond of lyf”: A?eynes Envye þat was sayd, Of oþur mennes hauyng þat neuer was payd, But of Mischef of his nei?ebore He is glad, and of his lore. “Blessed ben þo þat Mournen I-wis ffor heore frendes þat þei mys; Þei schul ben cumforted wonder wel”: A?eynes wraþþe hit is sumdel, Þat discumforteþ mon him-selue And þo abouten him, ten or twelue. “Þe Merciful ben blessed, for-þi God of hem schal haue merci”: Þat is a?eyn Couetyse, Þat to þe nedful wol not diuyse. “Þat hungren and þursten ri?twysnesse, Þei [schul] ben fulled more and lesse”: A?eyn þe Slowe þat nou?t wol wirke; Of alle gode dedes him þinkes irke. “I-blessed ben alle of herte clene, ffor godes owne face þei schul sene”: Herof þe gloten may aske ri?t nou?t, ffor of his foule wombe is al his þou?t. “Þat louen pes þei blessed ben alle, ffor Godes children men schul hem calle”: Þe Lechour in herte he haþ no rest; Of þis þerfore his part is lest. A?eyn þi woundes now hastou salue, Þe blessynges ?iuen of godes bi-halue. ?it ben þei spedful to lest [&amp;] most, Seuen ?iftes of þe holigost. Of þe Seuen ?iftes of þe holigost. Whon þou art hol sound, þe to lede Tak heer furst þe spirit of drede, Þat makeþ mon furst from vuel to wynne; Þe spirit of pite, wel forto bigynne Gode werkes; þat han a wel gret fo Of worldes wele and eke of wo: Þe spirit [of] cunnyng techeþ vs dispise Þe worldes wele [?if we ben wyse]; Þe spirit of strengþe, to suffre þe wo. Þeose foure to bisy lyf longen into, Þat we callen Actyf lyf. Þe oþer þreo rulen Contemplatyf. In Creatures to knowen God verrement, Þe spirit vs techeþ of entendement; Þe spirit of counseil, what is to do In writ, what is to leue also; To knowe god In his owne kynde, Þe spirit of wysdam vs bringeþ to mynde.

Of alle þe twelue þis is þe most: Þat ffader &amp; Sone and Holi gost On God Almihti in Trinite Euer was, and is, and euer schal be; Heuene and eorþe he haþ wrou?t, And al þis world he maade of nou?t. Þe ffader sende his sone Ihesu Þorw þe holygost vertu, God and Mon of Mayde Marie To be boren, and for vs to dye, And buried was, þorw his good wille, To sauen vs alle þat we ne schulde spille. To helle he wente whon he was ded, Þe soule Ioyned to his godhed; ffrom helle he hem fette swiþe blyue Þat him hedde serued in heore lyue. Vp he ros þe þridde day, As he was God and Mon verray; Riht so schul we, as seiþ seint poule, Rysen vp in bodi and in soule At þe grete day of doom— Þerof I rede we take good goom! Þen schal he demen al apert Vche mon after his decert. God and Mon to heuene he went; Þe holigost to þe Apostles sent. Þorw him so mowe we heuene wynne, ?if we dyen out of dedly synne.

But þorw gret temptacion Þat grace mi?te be struied soon: Þerfore is Confirmacion— Þat non may but Bisschop don; Þe holigost hit stableþ ri?t In þe, a?eyn þe fend to fiht. But after þeose we sungen al day: Þerfore penaunce hit doþ a-way Dedly synne and venial, Þat is to seye gret synne and smal; Þreo parties hit haþ verrey penaunce, Þerof þe synful mai ha fyaunce: ffor-þinke þe synne wilfulliche, And schriue þe þenne verreiliche, And make a-mendes to þi miht— Of al þi synnes þen art þow quiht. But leste in penaunce mon schulde fayle, Him neodeþ cumfort in þat trauayle: Hosul þerfore, in Bredes heu?

Of þe seuene dedes of Merci. Bute at þe dredful domes-day Mon schal haue an hard a-say, ffor he schal þenne a-posed be Of þe dedes of Charite.

Tac hede nou &amp; þou schalt se Of Contemplacion þe þridde degre, Of God hym-self wiþ-outen doute, Of Godhed wiþ-Inne, monhed wiþ-oute. Þre þinges þou þenke, as I þe rede, Of crist vr lord in his monhede: Of þe Incarnacion þe grete Mekenes, And of his liuyng þe holynes, And of his passion þe charite. At ones þou mai?t not þenke þise þre; I schal departe hem, as I may, Be þe houres of niht and day; Wiþ double Contemplacione In vche an houre of god þou mone: Ones of his passioun, And eft of oþer sesoun. Contemplacion at Matines tyme. At Mateynes þenk, aftur or bi-foren, W?at time &amp; vre, place crist was boren. Þe tyme was wynter, ?if þou be-holde, Þe vre was midni?t, wonder colde, Þe place, as doctours seyen and trowes, Was a toren hous wiþ-outen wowes. In Riche cloþus was he not wrapped, In Cracche wiþ ragges he was happed, Bi-twene an Oxe and an As— Gret Meknes þer I-schewed was! Be-þenk þe of þat cumpaignye Of Iosep and of swete Marie, Hou bisy þei weren to kepe þat fode Þat for us schulde dyen on Roode; Of þe herdes deuocion, And of þe Angeles þat songen abouen “Ioye be to god þat is on hi?”— In herte so syng þou priuely. Þenk how Iudas also outrayde At midni?t, whon he crist be-trayde; Hou þe Iewes þei him be-caste, And as a þeef þei bounden him faste, And as a feloun þei forþ him lad. Whon þe traitour a Cos him bad, In speche he was so Meke &amp; hende: His traytur he calde his dere frende. In dede also he schewed non awe, fforbed al hise wepne to drawe, And Malcus ere, þat Peter of smot, Heled hit a?eyn, not chid nor flot. Biforen Anna i-lad and Cayphas Vileynesliche þer I-boffeted was, And petur þryes wiþ-Inne a þrowe ffor-sok him, ar cok hedde þries crowe. And alle þe Apostles euerichon A-wey þei fledde, wiþ him lafte non. Of contemplacion at prime: of þe passion, and of þe Resureccion. Off þe passion þenk at prime, Of cristes vprist þe same tyme. Crist in to a ?ard at prime him ladde And fals witnesse a?eyn him hadde, Þat seiden hou he hedde god dispised, Þe cuntre al tornd and dyuised ffrom Ierusalem to Galyléé. And in his face þen spitten heo, Þei hudden his face &amp; bobed his hede And scorned him and bad hym rede Ho him smot þo wiþ his fuste. Nout he ne seide, þou? he wel wuste. Of þe Resurexion. Þenk also at prime, whon crist vp ros— Þerof wydewhere sprong þe loos— Vyue siþes apeered he þat day To his derlynges, soþ to say: ffurst to Maudeleyn, þat was him dere, Whon heo þhoute him a gardynere. To hire and oþure, verrement, As þei comen from his Monument; And seide “al heil! God saue ?ow.” And siþen to Peter—but we nute how. Þe ffeorþe tyme as a straunge pilgrim To twey disciples, þat knew not him, Toward Emaus, þe goode Castel; In bred brekyng þen kneu? þei him wel. Þe ffyfþe tyme to þe apostles ten, But Thomas was not wiþ hem þen; But þat hit was he þei nou?t bileeued, ffor a gost to hem he furst bi-semed, Til he schewede boþe foot and honde Amiddes hem þer he con stonde, “Pees to ?ow” he seide þon— Þei kneu? him wel whon he was gon. Biforen vndurne: Of þe passion, and of Witsuntyd. Þenk how crist at vndurne-tyde Was dispoyled, boþe bak and syde, And to a piler þenne was he bounde And skourged so sore wiþ mony a wonde Þat from þe foot to þe heued Hol skin was on [him] luitel be-leued. Wiþ Mantel of Red þei him cladde, Bi-foren þe folk þei forþ him ladde, ffor Septre a reod token him in honde, Crouned him wiþ þorn, I vndurstonde, And þenne þei kneled him be-forn And called him kyng al in scorn. Vp-on Pilate þen gunne þei crye Ihesu on Rode to Crucifye. He bar his Cros wiþ gret anuye To þe place þer he schulde dye. Bifore vndurne of þe holigost. Þenk also at þis same vre Þe holigost wiþ gret honoure Crist his apostles sende amonge, So wonderliche to speke wiþ tonge Þat folk þat weoren of oþur langage Heo[m] vnderstoden, &amp; seiden outrage Þat of wyn dronken þey were. Þe holygost also schewed him ful clere In fuir, to make hem hard and bolde, ffor þei schulde not in mischef folde. At Midday: of þe anunciacion, And of þe passion. At Middai be-þenk þe witerli Hou Gabriel grette vr swete ladi, Þenne conceiued heo crist Ihesu Þorw þe holigost vertu. But whi wolde he take flesch &amp; blode And siþen dye for vs on Rode, Siþen he mi?te ha saued Monkynde Bi an Angel, as I fynde? But þen schulde we ha loued be ri?t Þe Angel more þen god Almi?t; He wolde we loued him be-foren al oþur: Þerfore him-self bi-com vr broþur. Also of þe passion. Þenk hou crist was don on Rode— His bodi þen ron al on blode; Bi-twene twey þeues he hynged; Galle &amp; Eysel to him þei menged To drinke, for þurst whon he him pleined. ffor vre gult so was he peyned. In al þis world þow peynes alle Vpon o Mon mi?te falle And he mi?te suffre as muche more As alle men þat nou ben bore, Þe same deþ twye or þrie Þat crist suffrede þou? he mi?t dye, Þat peyne ?it were not so liche Nouþur nei? so as his so miche. Hit semeþ wel þenne bi þat i telle His peyne passeþ þe pyne of helle Þat pure creature mi?te þole, i-wis, ffor euere so may neuer on his. At Noon: of þe passion, and of þe Assencion. Be-þenk þe at þe vre of noon: Whon crist hed seid þat al was don, Mildeliche wiþ-outen bost To his ffader he ?eld his gost, And to him he made a cri Hely lama?abatani, Þat is to seye aftur þe Book “ffader, whiere þou me forsok?” As hos seiþ, þus here for to spille; A, lord, for hit was þi wille. A blynd kniht þen atte laste A Spere þorw [his] herte þraste, Þat Blod and water þen out ?ede. Þerof we schulde take good hede: Þe blynde kni?t þerof cau?te his siht, And vre Bapteme þere hedde mi?t. Lord, ?if me grace day and niht To þenke how deolfulliche þou were diht! Þe sonne for deol þen lees his liht, ffor to be wreken of his dispiht; Hulles and dales þei al to-schoken, And þe stones al to-broken. At Non of þe Assencion. Þenk also at þe vre of non Of Ihesu Assencion On þe Mount of Olyuete, Whon al þe Apostles þer gunne mete, And his deore Moder Marie, In al heore siht vp gon he sty?e, And sitteþ on his ffader riht hond, Þat weldeþ boþe Séé and Lond. Þe Apostles bi þe wey þat was geyn To Ierusalem þei torned a-?eyn, In preyer &amp; fastynge þer for to abyde, As he hem bad, til witsontyde. At euensong-tyme: of þe passion, and of þe Maunde. At Euensong-tyme þenk verreyli: ffor ded was founden his swete bodi, Ioseph þenne of Aramathi Tok him doun deuoutli, Of Pilat, þat þenne was hei? Iustise, He asked no more for his seruyse. Þi pouwer, lord, whon þow were ded, Hit was hud in þy godhed; As gras is stomped for medicyne, So were þou fruscht wiþ muche pyne; Allas for deol, boþe euen and Morn, Þe Croune of blisse lai vnder a þorn! Now of þe Maunde of Ihesu crist. At euensong-tyme of his Maunde Þenk; wiþ hou gret Charite He wu?sch his owne apostles feete, And of his Bodi alle þei ete As he heom ?af in bredes heu?, And to Iudas, þat waried Ieu?, Þau? he him wuste in synne derne, His flesch &amp; blood ?it nolde he him werne. Ensaumple herof þe prest may haue Non hosul to werne hose wol hit craue, In priue synne þou? he him knowe— To warne hym stilly is best, I trowe. At cumplin-tyme: of his passion, and of his buriinge. At Cumplin þenk wiþ good entent Hou crist in to a gardyn went After þe Maunde, forto prey His ffader þat passion to don a-wey; Þe Monhede of hym so sore dredde þat Þat blod &amp; water þer so he swat Þat hit dropped doun in þat place In to þe eorþe from his face. Of þe buryinge of Ihesu crist. Þenk at Cumplyn: þe bodi of crist Was leid in graue til his vpryst, Þat Ioseph di?te for him-self hadde; And in Sendel he him cladde, Wiþ Mirre and Aloyne, good oynement, He Baumede him, wiþ good entent.— Lord, ?if me grace swetnes to fynde Þeos Vres þus to haue in mynde, Þat suffredest for me þis harde paas! At myn ende hit be my solas.— Of Contemplacion of god in his owne kynde. Þus schaltou þenke on his Monhed. Now schal I teche of his godhed, Þat from vr knowyng sumdel is hud, And in foure wise to vs is kud: In Creature, and in holy writ— Þerof Ichaue my tale quit; Þe þridde be Reuelacion, Þe ffeorþe be monnes reson. Bi Reuelacion God scheweþ him-selue As he dude to þe prophetes twelue And to oþere Mony on, Or be Miracle open I-don. Bi reson þus God mai?t þou kenne, ?if þou wolt þe be-þenke whenne Þou were nou?t or þou boren were; Of oþer Creatures þe same manere, Þat comen &amp; gon eueriche day; Þe soþe þer-bi wel wite þou may And bi reson vndertake Þat þei mi?t not hem-seluen make; Heore biginnynge seþþen þou mai?t se, And of hem-self þei mowe not be, Þenne mostou nede grante sum þing Þat neuer hedde no bi-gynnyng, Oþur þynges of whom comen alle, God Almihti þat men calle. But twei goddes ?if þat þer were, Þer moste nede be sum manere Of diuersete hem bi-twene— Al on elles moste þei bene; Þen moste þat on, as wel I wot, Sumwhat haue þat þe toþer hedde not; Þen hedde þat on, sikerliche, Ouþer to luyte or to muche; ?if þat he hedde to luitel, He were not god almihtful; And to muche ?if þat he hadde, A sori god were and a badde Þat to muche mi?te not do him fro— To alle þing for þat is so. Siþen two goddes þenne mowe not be, On-lepi god þen graunte we. But Ioye is non here in no two afye (!) Wiþ-outen riht good cumpaynye. Siþen God is ful of Ioye and blis, In Godhed Cumpaynye þer is. Be-twene lasse þen two mai hit not be: Two persones in God þen mai we se. But cumpaignie were nou?t, I wene, But þer were loue hem bi-twene: Þe þridde persone, I wol warante, In Trinite þen moste we graunte, To make loue and Charite In þe holy Trinite. And þus mowe we knowe anon Þreo persones and God but on. In þi-self þou mai?t a-tame Open ensaumple of þis same: In þi soule þou seost ful wel Miht and Connynge þou hast sumdel; Þi mi?t Connynge þe wiþ-Inne To loue hem boþe þou const not blynne; Þi miht is furst, and þenne cunnynge, And of hem boþe comeþ louynge. Þe same manere in god aboue: Miht and Connynge and eke loue. Þe ffader we callen þe furst Miht, Connynge þe Sone, of him comeþ riht; Þe holigost loue we calle, Þat comeþ of boþe, knowleche we alle. Al Monkynde [knoweþ] in toun and felde Þe ffader waxeþ feble in his elde, Þe Sone in his ?ouþe is not wys, Of Monnes gost comeþ Malys. In god lest men wolde wene þe same, Þe ffader haþ mi?t, þe Sone wisdame; His miht is euer gret inlike, Þe sones wisdam may nou?t be swike. Þe Holigost he haþ goodnesse, Wiþ-outen Malys More and lesse. To knowe god þus furst men come Bi resun—so mai?t þou, ?if þou take gome Þin herte to god vp so to lifte, In þeose þreo wyse as I skifte: By his werk, and holy writ, And bi resun of monnes wit And of him-self in double kynde. Wel ou?te we þenne haue him in mynde, Þat al þis world wiþ þat þer-Inne ?af, and him-self, vr loue to wynne. Nou þou him knowest &amp; his bounte, Loue him wel for Charite Euer-more to þi lyues ende! To Ioye &amp; blisse þen schaltou wende, Þat he haþ ordeyned for vre solace. Lord, bring vs þider for þi grace. Amen. Þus endeþ þe spore of loue— God grant vs þe blisse of heuene aboue. [XXXVI. Þe Lamentacioun þat was bytwene vre lady and seynt Bernard.] Her is a gret lamentacion betwene vr ladi &amp; seint Bernard, Of cristes passion, hire dere sone, þat was so pyneful &amp; so hard. Lewed men be not lered in lore, As Clerkes ben in holi writ; Þau? men prechen hem bi-fore, Hit wol not wonen in heore wit: Þerfore is þat I syke sore, ffor broþurhede, as God hit bit, And, ?if cristes wille wore, Wel fayn I wolde amenden hit. ?if Crist haue send mon wit at wille, Craft of Clergye, for to preche, Alle hise hestes scholde we fulfille As ferforþ as we mihten areche. ?onge and olde, holdeþ ow stille: ffor broþerhed I wol ow teche— Þe Mon þat con, and teche nille, He mai haue drede of godes wreche.

Þe gospel nul I forsake nou?t, Þau? hit be writen in parchemyn; Seynt Iones word, and hit be sou?t, Þer-of hit wole be witnes myn. While Ihesu crist on eorþe eode, Mony of his Miracles writen þei were: Þer nis no mon þat mihte rede Þe goodnesse þat he dude here.

And þat we mowen alle I-witen As hit is in þe Bok I-writen, I wol ow telle, as I con, How þe fend tempteþ a Mon.— Hit was vppon an haly-day: In an hei? feste of þe ?ere; Muche folk was to churche gon: Godes word for to here; Þe Preost of þe chirche vndude þe gospel And lerede his parischens, as he couþe wel, And bad hem openly nyme good ?eme Hou þei scholden god wel queme And schenden þe foule fend of helle, Þat fondeþ euere iliche monnus soule to qwelle. Whon þe prest hedde I-spoken &amp; don what he wolde, Þe folk wente hamward, as ri?t was þei scholde. A good mon þer was, þat hamward gon rake, And þou?te ful ?eorne of þat þe prest spake; He eode be him one wiþ-oute fere ?erne, ffor no-mon of his þenkyng schulde hym werne. Þe wikked fend of helle þerof hedde onde And hastiliche sende to him his sonde. His Messager redi was forte don his wille, Him to bi-swyke, queynteliche &amp; stille. In þe wei he hym mette And feire þenne he hym grette— Was he no fend i-lyche, But as a mon feir and riche; Þe gode Mon was not war Of þe deuel, þat com þar. Quaþ þe wikked Counseyler: “ffelawe, wel I-met her! Sei me, as nou mote þou þe, Wher hast þow now I-be?” “I com from þe chirche, what woldestou þer-bi? What þou art &amp; whi þou askest, tel me nou, belamy!” “I am a ferren mon and a wey-feryng, Spek wiþ me feire, wiþ-outen grucchyng! Hastou atte churche I-herd eny sarmoun, Vndoynge of þe gospel or of lessoun? I prey?e þe, gode felawe, ?if þi wille be, Al þat þou herdest, tel hit nou to me! ffor I con my-self, beo my lewete, Of alle-maner lore gret plente.

Þauh þow to me haue no trist, I con more þen þe prest, And better I wot, forsoþe I-wys, How men schulen come to blis, And also more I con telle Wherfore Men schule go to helle.” Þe goode mon bigon his tale: þat oþur ?erne con luste; Al couþe he not telle: But dude þat he wuste. “Ouer alle þing he vs tauhte: To loue god, ful of miht, And siþen vre euencristene: As we ou?ten wiþ riht.

Þauh I oþur-while haue I-had wo, Þorw god þat hit sende hit haþ ouer-go; Hit was for my gode—þonked be he— He wolde þat I scholde bi þat I-war be.

He þat loueþ catel wel : And bounden is in Couetyse, He schal ben I-bounden : In þreo-kynne wyse: Þou?t and drede are þe two : Þat schul bynden hym faste, Þe þridde is muche serwe : Þat euermore schal laste. Ofte for his catel : Mon moot wake of slepe, Trauaylen in reyn and in snowh : Beo þe weyes neuer so depe, ffrom toune to toune : Boþe fer and neer, As Chapmen mote don : To heore mesteer; Ouer þe salte séé ofte þei fare ffor heor Marchaundise, in gret peril and care, And ofte and mony a tyme : [leseþ] Catel and heore lyf And makeþ vuel to fare : Boþe Chyld and Wyf. Oþer Men dyke and delue : And gon to þe plouh, To Cart and to þreschynge : And oþur swynk I-nouh. Whon he wiþ his swynk : Haþ wonne gret be-?ete, Euere he is afert : Þat he schal hit forleete; And ?if he hit leten schal : Hym is wo þerfore, And is so sori þenne : þat euer was he bore. Þou?t and drede &amp; sorinesse : Aren Monnes fo— He ou?te neuere loue : Þing þat doþ hym so wo. ?if he leose eny þing : And he gret good con, Beo-þenk hym of Iob : Þat was a good mon: He hedde of alle richesses : Swiþe muche won And in a luytel while : He nedde riht non; Þo he hedde riht nou?t : But al was a-go, Ne seide he for his harm : Enes ‘me is wo,’ But louede God wel : And þonkede hym þon— He dude as þe wyse : So schulde eueri mon;— Nolde he not for his los : Noþing sori be, ‘God,’ he seide, ‘hit me ?af : And bi-raft hit me;’ Ne grucched he nou?t, but þonked godes sonde And seide ‘blesset be his nome, in water &amp; in londe.’” Þe wikked gost onswerde þon And seide þat he was a folted mon. “Þou spekest of Lecherie And of fewe wordes makest monye; ffalse wordes wolt þou leeue &amp; here hem gladli— Þou nost what þou menest, i sigge þe sikerli! Of luytel wit hastou Mynde: Ne mot a Mon don his kynde? Hit was ordeynd þorw Godes biddyng At þe worldes be-gynnyng. Beo þi tale þow woldest hit bringe Al to-gedere in to spousynge Or elles leue þat game, Þat me nedde of God blame. Whose aftur þi counseil doþ, Repente him schal, I sei for soþ: He þat takeþ hym to spousyng, Mai not lyuen for no þing, Bote holden he mot to his wyf And ben in Cuntek and in stryf— Betere him were dihte and go— ffor weddyng is þe longe wo. Whon he haþ a wyf I-take, He mai hire nou?t forsake; He þat haþ a schrewe to wyue, Of vche a day him þinkeþ fyue; Of muche Murþe he schal misse And euere ha serwe and neuer blisse, Þer anoþer mai leue and take Wher he wole, and eke forsake; Lihtliche and glad may he go, Whon he þat is bounden schal be ful wo, And be liht and Iolyf More þen on þat haþ a wyf. ffor-þi I rede þat men do so And lete weddynge a-wey go.” Þe goode Mon wel vnderstod Þat his counseil was not good. “He is a fol and noþing wys : Þat foleweþ þi Red: Þe Mon þat foleweþ his flesches lust : His soule schal be ded; But ?if he do kuyndely : And wiþ spoused fere, In helle he schal a-buggen : His flessches lyking here.

Et faste and drink wel : And sleep euere a-mong: And þenne mayht þow lyue : ?eres monye and long.” Þe gode Mon, þat in god was stable, Vnderstod, þat he seide, was fable. “Wel I wot þat men mote liue : Be Mete and be drynk, As skile is and resun : And Mesure in alle þyng. Þei þat liuen as beestes : Aren wiþ-outen lay, Þat erliche eteþ and drynkeþ : And holdeþ on al day. Þe beest doþ his kynde : And þe glotun synne Doþ a?eyn his kynde : Þat wol neuer blynne.

Þe gode Mon þenne was a-bascht And lokede on þe wikkede gast And seide: “now wot I, þow art non Mon mad of flesch and bon; I vnderstonde wel be þi spelle Þat þou art þe deuel of helle.

Þe gode mon blessed him wiþ þe Crois And cri?ed on God wiþ loud vois, Bi-fore, be-hynde he blessed him fast, And Comaundede þat sori gast ffor to wenden : and so he dude þo, To þat stude þat he com fro. Pouwer hedde he no lengore dwelle, But wente doun riht in to helle. Þe gode Mon wente hom his way, And serued god wel to pay, And þonked him—so ouhte he wel— Þat him sauede from þe deuel. Ihesu Crist such grace vs sende Hym to serue to vre lyues ende, And kep vs from þe synnes seuene, And graunt vs alle þe blisse of heuene! PART II [XXXIX. Of þre messagers of deeth.] Her biginneþ a tretis Of þreo Messagers of deþ, I-wis. Þe Mon þat is of wommon I-bore, His lyf nis heere but a þrowe— So seiþ Iob vs heer-bi-fore Al in a Bok þat I wel knowe. He hedde is Muynde al of his deþ, Wel sore he con grone and grunte, And seide his lyf nas bote a Breþ, Heer mou we none stounde stunte. ffrom deþ may no mon be fre, ffor his ri?te wol he not lete. Now beoþ þer Messagers þre A-Mong Monkuynde for to meete: Auentures, Seeknesse, and Elde— Þeos beoþ Messagers of deþ; To hem we moten vs alle ?elde And louten þer vr Maystres geþ. Whon Deth comeþ þat is so derk, Þer May no Mon him wiþ-stonde; I take witnesse on a noble Clerk Þat wrot þeos vers wiþ his honde: Mors necat athletas, Ego mortis nescio metas, I[n]ter Res letas, Caueat sibi quelibet etas— “Deþ, he sleth þis kempes kene, And kynges in heore worþly won, Riche &amp; pore alle bi-dene, ?ong ne Old spareþ he non.” Þer is on of þis Messagers Þat of no mon wol take mede; He is so hardi and so fers Þat alle Men of him haue drede: Þe Messager hette Auentours; A?eynes him may beo no strif; Whon he comeþ to a Monnes hous, He takeþ boþe hosebonde &amp; þe wyf. He takeþ þe child In his Cradel, Þeih he beo bot o niht old; Þe kniht and horse in his sadel I-a[r]med, beo he neuer so bold. Of him beo vche Mon I-war And mak him clene, ar he beo hent; ffor þer nis no ?eyn-char, Whon Auentures comeþ to turnement. Mony mon lihþ in dedly synne And weneþ þat he beo not vey?e, And Auentures comeþ wiþ his ginne And hontuþ til he haue his preye. In dedly sunne ho is I-founde Wiþ-outen schrift and repentaunce, He geþ in to helle-grounde, Þer to suffre his penaunce. Seint Poul bit we schulden awake— Þis Clerkes witen as wel as I— Þat we schulden vs clene make And of vr sinnes ben sori; And bote we ben, we schulen abugge; Þer schal no pledur plede þat; Þer God vs fynt, he wol vs Iugge— Nou vche Mon be war bi þat. ffor Auentures wol come as a þef Be nihte, whon men ben aslepe, And taken awey þat him is leef— Nou awakeþ, þat ?e mowe him kepe. Anoþer Messager þer is Of Deþ, whon crist wol him sende: Seknesse, Ichaue I-herd ar þis, Þe Messager is swiþe hende. Whon seeknesse comeþ to a mon, He may be war ?if he is sleih, And greiþen his In, ?if þat he con, And þenken þat deþ is swiþe neih. ffor seknesse comeþ apertely, He ne dareþ not in his den; Hit is vre lordes Cortesy Wiþ seknesse for to warne men. Mony Men, whon þat heo beoþ seke, To Ihesu Crist a clepen and cri?e And to his Mylde Mooder eke And sigge: “now þou help, Marie! ?if þat we mowe be sound and saue And keuere, þat we mowen habben vr hele, Al þe good þat we haue ffor Godes loue we wolen hit dele.” We loue wel God in al vr þou?t While we beo seeke &amp; sore smerte; Whon we beoþ hol, we louen him nou?t, He nis no lengor in vre herte— Cum fero langorem, ffero Religionis amorem; Expers langoris Non sum memor huius amoris. Of crist ne takeþ he non hede, He naþ no more wiþ him to donne; To þonken him for his goode dede, He þenkeþ no more þer-vpponne. Suche men ben ofte al-one I-let To pleye as þe foul in þe lift, Til Auentures haue wiþ hem met, Be-Reueþ hem boþe hosel and schrift. Men ou?ten holden vp boþe heore honden To God, while heo ben hol and feere, To sende, whon he wol hem fonden, Seeknesse to ben heore Messagere. Seynt poul seiþ, vre lordes kniht, In a pistel þat he wrot, Þat he was strengest &amp; most of miht Whon god him wiþ seknesse smot. Now ichulle siggen ou of Elde, Of Messagers he is þe þridde. Whon Monnes hed biginneþ to elde, He may not do but beodes bidde. And he leoneþ vppon his Crucche, Whon deþ him bekneþ, comen he mot; Hit helpeþ nou?t þauh he grucche, He schal wiþ-stonde neuer a fot. Also fareþ Elde as doþ a sweyn Þat stondeþ at his lordes ?ate And mot not wenden in a?eyn, ffor þe po[r]ter þat is þer-ate; ffor no ?iftes þat he may ?iuen, Ne feire wordes þat he mai speken; He worþ out atte ?ate I-driuen, Anon þe ?ate for him is steken. ?if a Mon may libben heer And ben of pouwer for to go Þe Elde of ffoure-score ?er, Þat oþer del is serwe and wo. ffor hose wole his lyf be-holde ffrom biginnynge to þe ende, Wel ofte may his herte colde Þat not what wey he schal wende; Wel we witen we schule be ded, Vr dwellyng her nis bote a while— Ihesu crist vs wisse and rede, Þat neuer þe ffend ne do vs gyle.— Nou is deþ a wonder þing And grislich for to þenken on; He ne spareþ Emperour ne kyng, Ne Pope for al þe good þat he con. Wher ben heo þat biforen vs weoren, Þat weore so mihti in heore deden, Houndes ladden and haukes beeren An hontyng hei?e vppon heore steeden? Deþ hit haþ hem al by-raft, Wiþ hem þer nis no more pley.

Two Songs of Love-longing.] [I.] [Swete Ihesu, now wol I synge] Swete Ihesu, now wol I synge To þe a song of loue longinge: Do in myn herte a welle springe Þe to louen ouer alle þinge. Swete Ihesu, kyng of blisse, Min herte loue, Min herte lisse: In loue, lord, þou me wisse, And let me neuere þi loue misse. Swete Ihesu, myn herte liht, Þow art day wiþ-oute niht: ?iue me boþe Grace and miht ffor to loue þe ariht.

Swete Ihesu, Mi soule foode, Alle werkes of þe ben goode; Þou bou?test me vppon þe Rode And scheddest þeron þi swete blode. Swete Ihesu, Barn Best, Þi loue þou in myn herte fest; Whon I go North, Souþ, Est or West, In þe al-one fynde I rest. Swete Ihesu, wel may him be Þat þe schal in þi blisse se! Wiþ loue-cordes drau? þou me, Þat I may comen and wone wiþ þe. Swete Ihesu, heuene-kyng, ffeir and best ouer alle þing: Bring me in to þat loue-longyng To come to þe at myn endyng. [II.] [Marie Moder, Mylde Qween] Marie Moder, Mylde Qween, Send vs grace synne to flen, Þat we mowe þi sone i-sen And euere wiþ hym in Blisse ben. Ihesu, swete is þe loue of þe; Ne may no þing so swete be, Nou?t þat mon may þenke or se, Ne haue swetnesse a?eynes þe. Ihesu, no song mai be swettore, Ne þou?t in herte Blisfollere, Nou?t may be feeled lihtsomere Þen þou, so swete a louyere! Ihesu, þi loue was vs so fre Þat hit from heuene brou?te þe, ffor loue ful deore bou?test þou me, ffor loue þow henge on Roode-tre. Ihesu, to þi disciples dere Þou seydest wiþ ful dreri chere As þei seeten alle I-feere A luytel ar þou taken were— Ihesu, þou seydest þat þou wore fful of serwe and herte-sore, And beed hem dwellen a while þore While þou beo-sou?test þi ffader ore; Ihesu, þou eodest on þi feete To þe Mount of Olyuete, And to þi ffader, er þou leete, Þow madest a boone wiþ herte swete: To him þou seidest: “?if hit may be, Deore ffader, I preye þe, Þis peyne passe a-wey from me; As þow wolt so moot hit be!” Ihesu, þou tornedest to hem þan: And founde hem slepen vch a man; Þow beede hem waken, &amp;, er þou blan, A-non a?eyn þe wey þou nam.

Marie Mylde, freo and gent, Preye for me—þou art present— Whon my soule is from me went, Þat hit haue good Iuggement. Ihesu, for loue þou soffredest wrong, Woundes sore and peynes strong; Þi peynes reuþful weore and long, Ne may me hit telle in spel ne song. Ihesu, for loue þou suffredest so wo Þat bloodi stremes Ronne þe fro; Þi white bodi was bleyk and blo— Vre sunnes hit made, weylawo! Ihesu, þi Coroune sat þe sore, Þe scourgyng whon þow scourget wore; Hit was for me—Ihesu, þin ore!— Þe peynes þat þow þoledest þore. Ihesu swete, þow heng on tre Not for þi gult, but al for me, ffor sunnes and gult a?eynes þe— Swete Ihesu, for-?if hem me. Ihesu, whon þow streyned wore, Þi peynes woxen more and more. Þi Mooder euer wiþ þe was þore, Wiþ serweful sikynges and wiþ sore. Ihesu, whi weore þou pyned so Þat neuer wrou?test wrong ne wo? Hit was for me, and moni mo, Þat þou so harde were bi-go.

Ihesu my lemmon, þou art so fre, Þat al þou dedest for loue of me: What schal I for þat ?eelde þe? Þow kepest not but þe loue of me. Ihesu my god, my lord, my kyng, Þou askest me non oþer þyng But trewe loue and herte longyng And loue-teres and stille mournyng. Ihesu my deore, my loue, my liht, I wol þe louen, and þat is riht. Do me þe louen wiþ al my miht, And after þe Mourne dai &amp; niht! Ihesu, do me so loue þe Þat my þouht ay on þe be; Wiþ þin e?en lok on me, And Myldeliche my nede se! Marie ladi, Mooder briht,— Þou darst, þou wolt, þou art of miht,— Myn herte loue, my lyf, my liht, Þou prey for me boþe day &amp; niht. Ihesu, þi loue is al my þouht, Of oþer þing ne recche I nouht, But þat I haue a-?eyn þe wrouht And þou hast me so deore a-bouht. Ihesu, al-þau?

Ihesu, forsoþe now nis no þing In al þis world of such lykyng, Þat con so muche of loue-longyng, As þou Ihesu, my deore swetyng. Ihesu, wel ou?t I loue þe, ffor þou me schewest þi Rode-tre, Þi Coroune of þornes, and nayles þre, Þe scharpe spere þat þorw-stong þe. Ihesu, of loue I seo tokenyng: Þin Armes spradde to loue-cluppyng, Þin hed bouwede to swete cussyng, Þi syde al opene to loue-schewyng. Ihesu, whon I þenke on þe And loke vppon þe Roode-tre, Þi swete bodi bi-bled I se: Lord, do þat siht to wounde me! Ihesu, þi Moder þat bi þe stood, Of loue-teres heo wepte a flood; Þy woundes and þyn holy blood Heo maden hire haue a dreri mood. Ihesu, loue þe dude to wepen, Loue þe dude þi blod to sweten, ffor loue þou were sore beten, Loue þe dude þi lyf to leten. Marie, I prei þe, as þou art fre, Of þi serwe parte wiþ me, Þat I mowe serwe here wiþ þe And partiner of þi blisse be. Ihesu, þi loue þou tauhtest me Wiþ swete wordes of herte fre Þat þou speek on Roode-tre— So ful of loue ne mihte non be. Ihesu, þe furste word was, as I rede, Þat þou þi deore ffader beede Þat he for?af hem heore misdede, Alle þat duden þe to dede. Ihesu, þat oþer was I-wis Þat þou seidest, as writen is: Þat þe þeef schulde haue blis Wiþ þe þat day in paradis. Ihesu, þe þridde was of Mon: Whon þi Mooder þe schulde forgon, A Sone þou hire be-tauhtest on, And seidest: “wommon, tak heer Ion!” Ihesu, as þou weore pyned more, Þe ffeorþe word þou seydest þore: “A,” seydest þow, “me þursteþ sore”— Hit was for hem þat dampned wore. Ihesu, þe ffyfþe word Reweþ me Þat þow seidest on Roode-tre: “Mi God, Mi God, hou may þis be Þat þou hast al forsake me?” Ihesu, þe Sixte word hit was Whon þou seidest “In manus tuas,” Be-tauhtest þi ffader in þat plas Þi soule, as his wille was. Ihesu, In al þi peyne mest Neuere was so meke best— Þou seydest “Consummatum est,” Þyn hed fel doun, þou ?elde þe gost. Ihesu, þou seidest; “alle ?e Þat passen be þe wey bi me, A while a-bydeþ, comeþ and se ?if eny serwe is lyk to me.” Ihesu, þou seidest: “tel þow me, Mi deore folk, what hit may be, What haue I gult a?eynes þe Þat þou so bitter art to me?” Ihesu, þou seydest þenne more: “Mi deore folk, ?e tel me ?ore, Haue I wiþ myn holi lore And gode dedes I-hurt so sore?” Ihesu, þou seidest after ?et: “Mi deore wyn?ard, ne haue I þe set, Mi ffader blisse þe bi-het, Wiþ al my-self—what woldest þou bet?” Ihesu, þou seidest: “hou is þis, Mi Swete, what haue I do mis Þat þou wiþ-outen eny lis Me ?eldest schome a?eyn Mi blis?” Marie, þat slakest alle wo, Helle-peynes schild me fro, And ?if me grace her do so Þat I from henne to heuene go. Ihesu, ffyue welles I fynde in þe, Þat loue spring to drawe me; Of Rede blod þe stremes be, Mi soule of synnes wasschen heo. Ihesu, my soule drau? þe to, And mak myn herte wyde vndo; ?if hit þi loue to drynke so, Þat flessches lustes ben fordo! Ihesu, Muchel Ich owe þe: Who schal hit al ?elde þe? Me bi-houeþ þi-self hit be, As þou pyne suffredest for me. Ihesu, þi loue ?ef me follyke, In myn herte þat hit stike, Mi soule hit þurle Inwardliche, Þat hit be þyn enteerliche. Ihesu, do me loue þe so Þat, wher I beo or what I do, Þat I for weole ne for wo Ne let myn herte torne þe fro. Ihesu lord, Mi swetyng, Hold me euere in þy kepyng, Mak of me þi derlyng, Þat I þe loue ouer alle þing. Ihesu, my weole and al my wynne, Al my Ioye is þe wiþ-Inne: Now and euere kep me from synne, To do þi wille let me not blynne!

Ihesu, ?if me for þi name Pacience In peyne and schame, Þat to my soule is note and frame; And mak myn herte Mylde &amp; tame. Ihesu, Al þat is feir to se, Þat to þe fflessches lykyng may be, Al worldes blisse do me fle And al my tent ?iue to þe. Marie, Swete Mayden fre, ffor Ihesu [crist] be-seche I þe: Þi swete sone do loue me, And mak me worþi þat hit so be. Ihesu, in þe beo al my þou?t— Of oþer þyng ne recche I nou?t; Whon I of þe may felen ou?t, Þen is my soule wel of þou?t. Ihesu, ?if þou for-lete me, What may me lyken of þat I se?

A Mournyng Song of the loue of God. 1 To loue I-chulle beginne Ihesu boþe day and niht; Of ffleschlich loue to blynne I-chul don al my miht. Ihesu wiþ-outen synne In a Mayden he liht; Mi loue al for to wynne, Ihesu bi-com my kniht. 2 He fau?t a-?eyn my fo, A-wey he haþ me led Þat me wrou?te ful wo In care þer I was sted; Þorw ferly fiht and þro Þe ffeloun is from me fled, Mi lemmon let him slo, In loue to make my bed. 3 Mi lemmon is ful trewe Of loue, and ful studefast, Alle dayes I-liche newe He loueþ al on a þrast. I wolde þat alle him knewe And on him loue cast— Scholde non of hem alle rewe, Nouþer furst no last. 4 Mi lemmon is so meke, So hende, so swete, so stille; fful Mylde he is in speche, Wiþ-outen wordes grille; Þe gode he wole al eche, ffor?eten he wole al ille. ?if I fleo, he wol me seche, And wiþ loue he wole me tille. 5 Þeroute al-þauh he stonde Callynge at my ?ate Til him frese fot and honde, ffaste vn-to a stake, He ne takeþ staf ne wonde Wiþ wraþþe me for to wake; Mi loue him byndeþ as bonde, ?if I him murþes make. 6 He wol me loueliche a-byde Al-þauh I dwelle ful longe, He wol me no-þing be-chide Al-þau? I-chaue þe wronge; He seiþ: “bi-hold my syde, And whi on Rode Ich honge. ffor my loue lef þi pride, And I þe wole vnderfonge.” 7 Ihesu, þat art so hende, So swete and so þolemood ffrom þe whon so we weende: Allas, þat we hit vnder-stod, And to þe couþe leende And loue wiþ miht and mood, To haue wiþ-outen ende Heuene, þat is so good! 8 Ihesu for me is herte Let þurle þorw-out his syde, And duntes þolede smerte And woundes deope and wyde; Wo and al vnquerte He þolede, to fordo pride, Þe foule synne þat me gerte In helle from him me hyde. 9 Ihesu, my lemmon swete: Of loue þat þou art trewe, Þat is seene in hondes and fete, In heued, in huyde and hewe, Þi bodi of blod al wete, Whon þou gon on me rewe And me brou?test from grete And from my foule loue vntrewe. 10 So deore hastou me bouht To bringe me out of pyne, Þer I was Inne I-brouht, I and mo of myne. Ihesu, so fer þou me sou?t, Me and mo of þyne, Þat of þi lyf was þe nouht— So loþ þe was vs tyne. 11 Mi lemmon let him take, Putte &amp; Bete and Bynde, So sore as him mihte ake, His hondes him behynde: And al was for my sake, Mi loue so he heold In mynde. Ich ou?te euere serwe make, Vn-trewe ?if he me fynde. 12 Wiþ pyne vppon þe Rode Me bou?te my deore lemmon, Swete Ihesu þe goode, So muchel of loue he con! Þe teres he lette of blode ffor me whon he bi-gon. Madde þei aren and woode To leuen him for Sathan! 13 On Roode he wolde abyde,— He wolde nou?wher fer fle, Nouþer go ne Ryde, ffor nayled he is to þe tre. He spredeþ his Armes wyde, ffor loue as we mowe se; His herte þoru?-out his syde He ?iueþ vs, he is so fre! 14 Mi lemmon haþ so sprad His Armes þat beþ so longe: ffor-þi am I nou?t dred, He wol me vnderfonge. Whon I was from hym fled, On hym he tok þe wronge; To deþe til he was bled, ffor my loue wolde he honge. 15 He bekeneþ vs to blisse Wiþ louynde chere so swete, His Mouþ he beodeþ to cusse; ffor vs his lyf he leete To lere vs and to wisse, And nayled þorw-out his feete, Of Mede þat we ne misse His hondes beoþ þorw weete. 16 Swete Ihesu, þi ore! Þat al hast in þi miht, What mihtest þow do more ffor me, þi wrecched wiht? Of loue þou art my lore, To come to heuene briht. Þat herte may be ful sore To loue þe þat is not diht! 17 Now wol I crie and grete— ffor serwe hit is nei? þat I berste, Min herte-blod to blede ffor my lef þat is þus feste. Ihesu, ?if þat I schal spede, Þi-self þenne is bote beste. ffor grymly grete I drede, Wiþ þi bodi ?if I reste. 18 How mihti but I grete Til I eode out of my wit? I seo my lemmon blede To deþe, to liggen in put; His syde is schoren as schrede, His herte a spere haþ hut— And al for my misde[de] Was he so felli smit! 19 Now wot I me no won, Lemmon, what I do miht. I seo Marie and Ion, Þi Mooder and þy kniht, fful druri is hire mon ffor þe þat weore so briht— Nou is þer deolfolore non Ne vnlikkore in siht. 20 Þyn e?en briht as Sonne, Mone and Sterres alle, Þei woxe deske and dimme, Þi feire Rode dude falle; Þi blod was al out Runne. To drinke whon þou gonne calle, Þe wikked men beoden þe Eysel &amp; atter, Bitterore þen þe galle. 21 Wiþ spittyng and wiþ fen And blod out-beten sore Þow weore al out of ken, A La?er as þow wore. Þei beote þe, þi foo-men, Of loue to lere vs lore— Þou be blessed, amen, Now and euer-more! 22 Sore I seo þe buye Al my loue-plawe— Al is for my folye Þat þou dri?est heer a þrawe. Allas þen may I crie, And her and huyde to-drawe, I seo my lemmon dy?e On Roode wiþ-outen lawe! 23 Allas, Allas, out ay, Þat euer was I boren! His deþ is Iewes play, His Coroune is of þorn. Mi lemmon, weylaway! ffor me is lyf haþ lorn, His bodi is al blodi Be-hynden and bi-foren. 24 I seo in eorþe synke, Lemmon, þin herte-blode, Þat þow wiþ pyne and swynke ffor me scheddest on þe Roode. Þerof whi ne moste I drynke, Þat is so swete and goode, On þe þat I mihte þinke ffor loue ay til I eode wode? 25 Allas, þat I ne couþe, Lemmon, don al þi wille Wiþ werk, and word of mouþe, Boþe loude and stille! Almihti god hit ouþe I mihte þe to me tille, So briht so sonne in Souþe, Of þe þat I mihte haue my wille. 26 Marie Mooder Milde, Mi lemmon is þi sone— Wiþ him þou eodest wiþ childe, ffor me wiþ him to wone. I haue ben wood and wylde: Þou preye him þat I cone Loue him, &amp; þat he me schilde, Or eny oþer to mone. 27 Alle oþere I-chulle forsake And don out of my þou?t, To þe, Ihesu, I me take— So deore þou hast me bouht! Al oþer loue wol make Endynge and waxe to nou?t: Þi loue nul I forsake, ffor þat bringeþ vs alle o-loft. 28 To wone wiþ þe, bi-leue Lemon, vnder þi tre— May no pyne me greue Ne do me fro þe fle. I wol in at þi sleue, Al in þin herte to be, Myn herte schal berste and cleue, Vn-trewe ar þou me se. 29 fful hard hit is, þi bed: A treo þat stondeþ stille, In wo and weder sted; Þeroute he hongeþ on hille, ffor-beten and for-bled Wiþ Men þat wolden hem spille. Al þus haþ loue þe led, Þi lemmon for to tille. 30 Þi-self þou mai?t not schelde, Ne torne, so art þou fest; Þou hast nout on to helde Þin hed, on for to rest, Almihti kyng to welde Al þat is worst and best. Hou miht I euer þe ?elde Þe loue þat þus wol lest? 31 Cloþing hast þou non— ffor scorn men makeþ þe bare; Þi ffrendes aren from þe gon, And flowen þat wiþ þe ware, Alle bote Marie and Ion, fful of serwe and care— fful dreri is here mon, Þi pyne is al þe mare! 32 Ihesu Crist, my lemmon swete, Þat dy?edest on þe Rode-tre, Wiþ al my miht I þe bi-seche ffor þyne woundes two and þre, Þat as depe in to myn herte Mot þi loue I-stiked be As was þe spere in to þyn herte, Whon þou suffredest deþ for me. XLIV. Her is a luytel Sarmoun, þat is of good edificacioun. At a Sarmoun þer I seet A comely clerk Ich herde crauen, Wyse wordes he þer speek Þe Mon þat wolde in herte hauen; Ich herde ffrere Henri spellen: “Lete no sunnes in ow dwellen; Þe Mon þat is taken in dedly synne, He may wel witen In wo to wellen. “A þing hit is þat we schul do, Þe Mon þat þenkeþ to liuen in le: Schrift to taken, and þat be tyme— We haue no Borwes heer to be; Whon we hauen, to holde faste, We ne mowe raples þorw þo þre To Bere þe croune to-fore þe kyng Þat for vs þolede deþ on tre. “He þat for vs þolede deþ on tre, Þou Rihtwys lord, þou deme so: Wis vs to þat ilke stude Þat euere is wele and neuer wo.

Wiþ ?or leue, I wol be-gynne Of a Mater for to mynne, A good þing for to make, On þe hexte þing hit is Þat euer was mad: þat is þe Mes, Monnes sunnes to slake. Eueri day þou mai?t se Þe same bodi þat di?ed for þe, Tent ?if þou wolt take, In figure and in fourme of Bred, Þat Ihesu dalte, er he weore ded, ffor his disciples sake.

I do ow wel to witen wiþ-outen drede, Þe Masse was mad for monnes nede, ffor al folk lasse and mare. As þe prest seiþ his preyere, So schulde vche mon þat him gon here, And þei wuste what hit ware. ?if I seide þis word wiþ my wit, Wiþ-outen witnesse of holi writ Wisdam weore hit non; Þerfore I wole þat ?e hit witen, Hou þat we fynde hit writen Wiþ Auctours mony on. Of Austin, Ambrose, Bernard, and Bede, ?it heore Resons wol I rede A-Mong ?ow euerichon. Þei make muynde of mony a mede Þat we schul haue for vre good dede, To churche whon þat we gon.

Baldely mai?t þou swete and swynke ffor to wynne þe Mete and drinke Wiþ-outen tray or tene; And ?if þou be in eny drede, Al þe better schalt þou spede To keuere of cares kene. ?if þou haue eny wey to wende, I rede þou here a masse to ende In þe Morennynge ?if þow may; And ?if þou may not do so, I rede, beo vnderne ar þou go, Or elles be hei? midday. Serteynliche wiþ-outen fayle Þou schalt not leose of þi trauayle Not half a foote of way; O þi bodi þou schalt be lihtore, And þi weyes wende þe Rihtore, Þorwh him þat mihtes may.

Seynt Ierom seiþ: for soules sere, Þauh a Mon wolde a þousent ?ere Do a Masse for to synge, Hit is nouþer more ne las But vch a soule schal haue a mas— Hit is so hei? a þinge. ?it I Rede ow go to chirche, Godes werkes for to worche, In-to vr laste endynge: Haue we no doute of vr dole, Vch soule schal haue a masse al hole, Þorw help of heuene-kynge. fful hard hit were to vre bi-houe Vch a prouerbe for to proue Of þeos Auctours alle; Serteynliche wiþ-outen lees Of sum of hem þen wol I sees ffor þing þat may be-falle; ?if I drou? hem on lengþe, I trou no mon schulde haue þe strengþe To stonde and heere hem alle.

Serteynly, wiþ-oute delay And ?e for þe prest pray, And he atte Masse ?ou mynne, Sikerli I dar wel say, Þer nis no tonge þat telle may What Mede þat ?e may wynne. But ?it I telle ?ou, sikerly: And ?e preye but only ffor ?or owne hele, I do ?ow to witen wiþ-outen drede ?e beo not worþ so muche meede, Not be þe haluendele, As þi kuynde puttes þe to To don vuele he biddes þe do. ?if þou wol wone in weole, Prey for þe prest, and he for þe: Þat Is a preyere of charite, Þen mai?t þou synge of loue lele. Loue is trewe in vche a leede; ?if þou do ille, vuel schalt þou spede ffor al þe craftes þat þou con. Whon þat þou comest þe chirche with-Inne And þou sest þe prest bi-gynne, Take his vestimens on: Loke þou do as I sey þe, Knele a-doun vppon þi kne, Noyse þat þow make non; Seþþe stond vp at þi seruise, And serue god on þis wyse, Al folk euerichon: Þou schalt say: “þi drihten And deore god almihten, And In Marie I me a-seure, Þat heo saue vs alle, Boþe grete and smalle, Of sunnes we beþ vn-pure; And þat I may me schriue Of al my wikked lyue To Prest þat bereþ þe cure, Þat I haue I-wrou?t And in herte I-þou?t As vnkuynde creature. “I was vn-kuynde, And was þenne blynde, To worche a-?eynes his wille Þat fust me wrou?t, And seþþe me bou?t ffro peynes he was put to ille.

Certes, sires, ful good hit is To stonde stille at þe Mes, Sum good word for to say; Whuche þat ?e wole preye fore, Þauh ?e do for mony a score, At a Masse ?e may; Alle þo þat ?e nempne nou?t, But only þenke in ?or þou?t Þat ?e wolde fore pray, I do ow to wite wiþ-outen doute, Þer nis no soule a Masse wiþ-oute, But he haue helle for ay. Wust I my ffader in flesch and felle Weore holliche I-holden in helle, Þer weore non hope of hele, To preye for him I couþe no Red, No more þen for a Dogge were ded, But let hem wiþ him dele. ?it I rede we go to chirche, Godes werkes for to worche, ?if we wole wone in wele; Seþþe hit is vnknowe to vs, We schul preye for alle ffidelibus To Rewe soules þat beþ lele. ?it I bidde ?ou takeþ good tent Þat ?e holde no parlyment Wiþ no cristen mon, Whon ?e come þe Churche with-Inne, And ?e seo þe prest bi-ginne Take þe vestimens on: Þe foule fend so fel is, He writ ?or wordes I-wis On a Rolle euerichon. Also witnesseþ seynt Austine, Þat furst wit in Engelond gan lene, And preche þe treuþe bi-gon. Ar seynt Austin In Engelond come, Wiþ pope Gregori of Rome fful long tyme gon he dwelle. Vppon a day for worschupefulnesse Þe Pope wolde synge a Messe As him ful fayre bi-felle: He made a signe to seynt Austyne, ffor he schulde ben his dekne digne To Rede þe gospelle. And as he radde, þen sauh he þen Two wyues, as ?e may witen, Tales þen gonne þei telle. Seynt Austin herde þis wordes alle; In A wyndow on þe walle Þer bi-fore his face A foul fend he sau? þer-In, Wiþ penne &amp; enke &amp; parchemin, As God ?af him þe grace; He wrot so faste til þat he want, ffor his parchemyn-skin was so scant, To speken þei hedde such space; Wiþ his teeþ he gon hit togge, And so radli he gon hit Rogge Þat al þe Rolle gon race. So harde raced he þat Rolle, Þat he chopped his Cholle A?eyn þe Marbel-ston. Al þe folk I þe chirche About Was a-stoneid of þat clout And herden hit euerichone. Seynt Austin sei? hou faste he drouh: He barst on lauhtre, and loude louh. Þe Pope ful sore gon grone, ffor serwe nei? þe Pope wept. After masse, Austyn he met, And Mekely made his mone. He made his mone wiþ mylde mod: “Whi weore þou so wikked and wod ffor to do þat dede? A worse dede miht þou neuer done.” Austin onswerde him ful sone— Þerof he hedde gret drede: “Lord, greue ?e nou?t til þat ?e wite. A foul fend I say site— Serwe mot ben his mede!— Two wyues sat ?onder langare, Alle heore wordes wrot he þare Vppon a Rolle to rede. “Þei tok no tent til heore Mas: Al heore wordes more and las, He wrot hem euerichon; ffor to speke þei hedde such space, Þe fend wrot wiþ a foul face Til his Parchemyn was al gon. Whon his parchemyn was al spende, He rauhte þe Rolle bi þe ende, Wiþ his teth a-non He logged, þat al in-synder gon lasch, And wiþ his hed he ?af a dasch A?eyn þe Marbel-ston. “Lord, greue ?e not for þat dunt! He stoneyd me, and made me stunt Stille out of my steuene. I wol sigge as I se?e, ffor a word wol I not ly?e, Be Mihtful kyng of heuene.” He ladde him forþ, as I trowe, Til he com to þe wynt-douwe Þat I be-fore gon nemene: ffoul þei fond þer I-sched, As blac as pich was I-spred Vppon þe Aschelers euene. Þis is wonder þing wiþ-outen drede; Þer was neuer fend blod mihte blede, He haþ nouþer flesch ne bon; But god wolde þat hit were so, To chastise hem and oþer mo Þat to churche gun gon. Til a Masse was seid to ende, A Mon schulde talke with fo nor frende, But holde him stille as ston; Þat hous was mad for preyere To Ihesu and to his Moder dere, To þonke hem al heore lon. At þe wyues gon þei witen What þei seiden whon þei siten Seynt Austyn hem bi-syde, Bi heore onswere þei wuste ful wel Þat þei hedde spoken muchel vncel, And in heore hertes gun hyde. Þerfore, sires, I rede ?e loke, God tent I wolde ?e toke, ffor þing þat may bi-tyde, Þat ?e mesure ?ou þe mare, Of speche þat ?e ow spare, At Masse whon þat ?e byde. Þe Pope greued him wel þe lasse; He let comaunden at þe Masse Of þat Miracle to mynne, And also bad wiþ ful good wille Þat eueri Mon schulde stonde stille Whon he comeþ þe churche with-Inne; And þenke hou wel þat god may wreke Euerich a word þat we speke; We do ful muche synne: A Prest mi?t be let of his mes, Al þis world mi?t fare þe wers, Vs alle to wo to wynne.— “Vr ffader vre al-weldyng is, God let vs neuere his murþes mis. Lord, halwed be þi name. In heuene and eorþe þi wille Be don, and þat is skille, Or elles we ben to blame. Vr vche-dayes bred ?if vs to-day. Þat we may trustily whon we schul away To come to þi kyndame. God kepe vs to vre laste endynge, Let neuer þe fend wiþ fals fondynge Cumbre vs in no schame.” Þis pater noster schulde ben vsed And for non orison beo refused, I schal ?ow telle for whi: Of his Mouþ hit was maad, Þat al þis world long and braad Out of Bale gan buy?e. Leeue hit wel, and not wene hit, Þe pater noster contened Alle þing hollye Þat vs neodeþ, and non oþer, Boþe for þis world and þat oþer, Quik whon we schal dye.

A Resun I schal reden ow riht Whi þe day bi-fore þe niht Was ordeynt for to be. ffor Adam of þe Appel eete, Ihesu Crist vr bales con beete, Þat dyed vppon þe Tre; Out of liht þat he was Inne, In-to helle for his sinne, Holliche þer was he; He was banischt out of blis In-to helle, boþe he and his, Bi-foren þat was so fre. ?it a Resun I schal ?ou say: Whi þe niht bi-fore þe day Was ordeynt, I schal ?ou telle: ffor Ihesus suffred woundes fyue, And siþþe a-Ros fro deþ to lyue, And after herwede helle; Out of þesternes þorw his miht A?eyn he put him to þe liht Whuch þat he fro felle, And dude him a?eyn in paradis Þat he hedde lost boþe he &amp; his, Wiþ speche as I ow spelle. A luytel bi-fore þe prest wasch Let him not his offryng asch ?if þou þenke for to offre; Whon he torneþ a-non þe tille, Go vp to him with ful good wille And þi peny him profre.

But fayn I wolde þat þou þus seide Whon þou in his hond hit leide, Or þenk hit in þi þouht: “God, þat was In Bethleem bore, Þreo kynges kneled þe beo-fore, And heore offryng brou?t; Þou tok heore offryng of alle þre: So receyue þis of me, And for?ete me nou?t, Þat I may euere wiþ þe wone, And kuyndelich clepe þe godes sone, On þe Roode as þou me bou?t.” Whon he haþ waschen, þen he walkes, Priueliche and stille he stalkes To his Auter a?eyn.

He þat is lest worþ most wole desyre Of prelacye, to ben a syre; No þing he þenkeþ to good profyt, But honour of þe world is his delyt. Amalek. Be þe ledyng a mon may knowe, i-wis, Of what tecches his leder is; Þe wyse mon draweþ to him þe wyse, And þe wilful mon to mon of his gyse. Seneca. He þat pleyeþ best at þe des, Preyseþ faste þe hondes of hasarderes; Þe more sotil he is of þat art, Þe more he stont on euel part. Seneca. He þat saueþ a schrewe from schame, To gode men he scheweþ blame; Whon þe þef passeþ quyt a-way, Þe trewe mon haþ schome, what-euer men sai. Seneca. He may saue moneye and gete Þat wol be curteys of his mete; After gret spendyng he may wayt Þat of mete &amp; drink is to strayt. Ionas. Hose ledeþ his lyf in sinne And of euel dedes wol not blinne, Godes merci he askeþ in veyn, But he forsake his synne, certeyn. Syrak. Loke to visyte þat þou be smert Þe seke folk wiþ gode hert; Þerfore þou mai?t be þe more parfyt In þe loue of Ihesu crist. Salomon. Wiþ-outen counseil do no gret þing; Aftur þat dede þou schal haue good knowing Þat gode counseyl dude þe profyte, Wiþ-outen whuche þou scholdest had lyte. Ecclesiastes. ?if þou herest speke a bacbitour, Contenaunce to him mak of irrour; Whon he seoþ hit likeþ not þe, Cece of his speche anon wol he. Seneca. To þi frendes tak þou credence, Do vche mon riht be concience, Be meke to hym þat aboue þe is set, And haue mesure to þi soget. Seneca. Or þou bi-hote enydel, Wher þou wolt do so, bi-þenk þe wel; ffor muche to bi-hote &amp; ?iue but softe, Makeþ mon to be chalanged ofte. Seneca. Mon holdeþ a luite ?ift more dere Wiþ-outen be-heste wiþ gode chere, Þen he wolde of a gret þinge Of bi-heste wiþ long tariinge. Salomon. Muche speche nis not wiþ-outen strif; Hose kepeþ his tonge kepeþ his lyf; He þat his tonge con not holde, In cumpaygnye a schrewe is tolde. Gregorius. Large table and plentyuouse Makeþ men of Ianglyng surfetouse; Whon þe bodi I-fuld is, Þe tonge is redi to speke amis. Salomon. A fol ?if he speke no þing, Men wene he beo wys in doyng; Whon he bi-gynneþ to Iangle fast, Þen men knowen wel his cast. Seneca. An old wommon þat takeþ hosebonde, Heo worcheþ hir-self schome and schonde To hire a-stat, &amp; hire bodi bounde is wiþ-Inne A present for to bere to synne. Syrak. Þe herre of stat þat þou be Þe more meke haue þou þe; Þe more þou hast of mekenesse Þe fastore þou encresest of goodnesse. Seneca. A Caytif forsoþe he i-called may be Þat neuer soffred caytyfte; Good los neuer þou gest But ?if þou leose oftesyþe þi rest. Saulus. Gret los &amp; reste, me þinkeþ wel, A-corden to-gedere neuer a del; Oþur þou most þi loos lese Or ofte-tymen for-go þyn ese. Ioseph. Entre þou neuere wiþ-outen conpaygnie Þer wommon al-one is of vilenye; ffor ?if þow parfourne not lecherye, On þe heo wol þenne sette a crie. Seneca. Envye good lyf wol distruye, And loos is lost þorw lecherye; Lecherye and good loos Ne mowe not euere to-geder be clos. Seneca. Harde chaunce is hym be-fal Þat haþ non enemy at al; ffor ?if grace of good lyf hedde he, He nere not dilyuered of enemyte. Seneca. Þe cause of acord is, god hit wot, Whon vche mon is payed of his lot; But of discord þe cause nou is Whon mon wol make comun þing his. Salomon. He is more worþ þat con distresse Him-self, and refreyne in hastinesse, Þen he þat may fulli conquerre Al a cuntre bi strengþe of werre. Constantinus. He þat bi werre takeþ lond or cite, Be strengþe of his peple þat doþ he; But he þat haþ maystred his owne herte clos, He haþ onliche a souereyn los. He þat con euel is holde wys and worþ, Symplesse &amp; wit ne mowe not forþ; Þe lufthalf is put vppon þe riht, And wrong for wynnyng ouur ri?t haþ miht. Syrac. Better is folye þat falleþ of symplesse, Þer as cautel in soule nis more ne lesse, Þen of þis world al þe wit, ffor ofte-tyme þe lawe of god distruieþ hit. Salomon. Hose doþ to pore duresse or peyne, To encrese his richesse, certeyne, An herre mon schal parte wiþ his riches, And of alle godes he schal haue þe les. Salomon. Trouwe þou neuere þat þing be þin Þat oþur mon seiþ ‘þis is myn;’ Þyn is þyn euel oþur good doyng Þat þou hast wrou?t, wiþ-outen oþur monnus þing. Seneca. ?if þou haue lond, hous or yle, Þelke nul dure but a while; Wiþ þe schal go þi gode dede, Þin hous abit, wiþ-oute drede. Ecclesiastes. Muche to write &amp; no þing rede, Luitel is worth, wiþ-outen drede; Orisouns helpen soules of men Þat wiþ delyt conseyued hem. Cato. Lettres þou schalt rede on such manere Þat þou vnderstonde þe sentence clere; Muche to rede wiþ-outen vnderstonding, Caton seiþ hit is a dispysyng. Þerfore I wole after þis resoun Of þes prouerbes cesse of þe translacioun; ffor he þat wol rede þis wrytyng, In schorte wordes may haue lykyng. Augustinus. Nou preyeþ alle wiþ deuocion ffor hym þat made þis lesson, Þat he þorw ?oure orisoun Mouwe come to sauacion. And god, þat made alle þing, ?if vs alle good endyng. A. M. E. N. Amen. 22.

A Morning Thanksgiving and Prayer to God. 1 I þonke þe, lord god, ful of miht, Wiþ al þat euer I con &amp; may, Þat hast me sauet þis ilke niht And suffret me forto abyde þis day. I-blesset be þou euer &amp; ay, And halewed be þin hy?e name; And worschypet be þou, lord, al-way, Wiþ hy?e &amp; lowe, wylde &amp; tame. 2 In þe name of god þat al þing wrou?th, Heuen &amp; erþe and vche creature; In þe name of ihesu þat me dere bou?th, Þat is god, godus sone so pure; Þe holygost, god in o figure, To þe, o god in persones þre, I be-take þis day of me cure, And wiþ þi tokene I marke me: 3 Lord god, þat þis day woldust make, And schope me to lyue þer-ynne, My body &amp; soule I þe be-take. Þis day, lord, kep me out of synne, Wiþ trouþe þis day my lyflode to wynne, So þat I do þe non offens, ffrom þi lawe þat I ne twynne, Ne breke þi ten commaundementes. 4 Lord god Ihesu, as þou were boren in a dawynge, Of a virgyne pure &amp; clene, Kepe me, lord, þis morewenynge, Þis day in dedly synne þat I not byn lene, ffor wyninge of erþelyche godus: ffrom flessch[ly] lustus &amp; lykynge, Kepe me, lord, wiþ þi pressyos blod, ffrom temptacions of þe fende. 5 And as þou were turmentud sore In þat selue tyde of niht, Wiþ bobbyng, scorny[n]ge &amp; wel more, ffort hit were dayes light [ight] Sende me þis day do sum good dede In lettyng wrong &amp; doyng riht, Þat þou, lord, mouwe quyte me my mede. 6 As þou were lord, when hit was day, Ofte examnet wiþ wordus grete, Wiþ bysschopes of ful gret aray, Wiþ proude prynces þat þe con þrete, Sende me þis day drynk &amp; mete, And susteyne me in þi seruise; ?if I be mys-hap, lord, þe fo[r]?ete, Þorw þe, lord, let me aryse! 7 Lord I be-take þe my fiue wyttes; Myn y?en, þat I synge not in sy?th. Lord, my mouth open hit in þi werkes, Þer-wiþ þat I may speke truþe &amp; ri?th. Myn heryng, lord god, dele &amp; dy?h To here noþing a?eyn þi wille; My nese, lord ihesu ful of my?th, Kepe hit þat I non vuel smel. 8 Lord, kep &amp; lede my feet also Þat heo don þi seruyse, Þat with hem I not mys go. Myn honden, lord, kep on alle wyse, And set hem, lord, in such asyse Þat I, [o] lord, with hem not synne. And ?if I do, lord, let me aryse, And let me not longe lygge þerynne. 9 Þey? I haue syngut her-be-fore, Let me not for-garte þi grace. I crye þe mercy, lord, euer more; Of amendement, lord, sende sum space, And sende my soule for my trespace. Þenke, lord, I am þi creature, And sende me, lord, help now in þis cas Þi mercy out ouer al mesure. 10 Lord, wharto woldust vengaunce take On me þat ?elde me þus gulty? I may not amendus make, But put me holly in þi mercy, And for my synne I am sorye: Þenk, of my self no my?th I haue; But þou me help, in synne I dye: Þi grace, mercy, lord, may me saue. 11 My soule, my body, lord god ihesu, I now by-take in þi kepynge; Kepe me, lord, in þi vertu, In al my werk &amp; al my worchynge. In þi nome be al my doynge! In þe nome of Ihesu I be gynne: Lord god ihesu al weldynge, Þis day kepe me out of synne! Amen!</field>
