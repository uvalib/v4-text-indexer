      <field name="fulltext">TO THE PARENTS WHO ARE NO MORE SEEN ON EARTH This Poem is Dedicated IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF DEBT WHICH CAN NEVER BE REPAID, IN TOKEN OF LOVE WHICH CAN NEVER DIE, BY THE AUTHOR.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GLAN-ALARCH HIS SILENCE AND SONG BOOK I. I am the bard GlÃ¢n-Alarch, he who sings Beneath the morning cloud which wraps Crag-Eyrie, Who basks upon his sun-kiss'd side at noon, And sleeps with him in silence when his crownâ A beacon fire whose message hath been spedâ Fades on the east where he prolonged the day. I am GlÃ¢n-Alarch, he whose day of life Is likewise hasting to its close, who holds His course, a waning, lonely light, ere long To drop as drops the sun,âbut in a sea, If not more silent, one whose murmurous music, Hath never found a voice in tongue of man,â And leave his fame to live a twilight hour Glowing upon the heights he loved to range. An ancient bard! an eagle who no more May front the eye of day on outspread wing, And see the earth's rim rise, while his lone eyrie Fades in the deepening blue beneath his feet. An ancient bard! A garden all deflowered, A wintry tree, whose summer crown of leaves Is laid in golden fragments at his root; An ancient bard!âa singerâif a seer, One whom the vision overtakes like sleep,â Whose harp a passing sigh can wake to music, Or but the idle fingers of the wind. An ancient bard,âmy children, have you thought What that may mean? A poet with the snows Of time upon his beard and burning lips; A nightingale whose song is for the rose, Belated where his rose has ceased to bloom; A child who in a cave which darkens daylight And deadens music, wears away his heart, And struggles to repress the life that throbs Too rudely for his mouldering house of clay. But not in sadness will I quench my song; For joy still lives, if not for old GlÃ¢n-Alarch, And pride of strength; what though its fountains rise From other springs than his,âits droppings reach Him in his drouth; and there is light in heaven For him and every poorest thing that breathes; And bardic fire for me, which, when it burns, Mine ancient house still glows with deathless youth! I would it burned more fully; that its flame Were high, and worthy of its source divine; Then would I sing of Eurien, then would make His gracious strength, his valour, and his skill, His royal rage in combat,âseen alas! Too often on our fields of civil strife,â His daily victories with hawk and hound, His daily largess at the castle gate, His princely gifts of bracelet and of torque, The smile which doubles all he gives, and makes The proud his cheerful debtors;âthese, and all The graces of his mien,âhis blue-veined brow, His wealth of sun-bright hair and amber beard, His lordly glance, curled lip, and many more The proud adornings of his golden youthâ These would I make to cling about the name I love, till Time, himself grown old, should look Back on young Eurien, and long for light Like that which glowed upon our ripening world. The valleys in a circle which an eagle Upon the quest might gather in his glance, Are Eurien's; all their short sweet herbage cropped By Eurien's flocks; the mountain's wooded flanks And savage moorlands are his hunting grounds; The hamlets, and the scattered townships, sown On lake and stream, are peopled with his lieges, Or those who look for judgment at his hand. Crag-Eyrie, and the peaks which stand at guard Around, are Eurien's citadels, and help His strong right hand to hold his subject realm, And keep at bay the lawless ones without. Young Chief of all the region heaving round Crag-Eyrie, lord of lands and lives of men, Lord of his wild rock castle, and himself, He gave me shelter when the fierce red wave Of war had wasted all that once I owned, A home, and four brave sons who bore it up. A youth, he held me out a filial hand And raised me from the dust where I had died; He smiled upon me, and I thought at whiles My youngest born looked comfort through his eyes. He brought me here; he set his roof above My faint, bleached head, and bound my falling hairs With golden wreaths of honours; by his hearth My place was warm, and when he called a council, My chair was set at Eurien's right hand. What could I do for Eurien but liveâ Cede him the worthless life that he had saved? Stand for him yet awhile on the bleak rise,â The 'vantage-ground of sorrowful old age,â And shout him warnings from the troublous past; Or turn when he is sad, and with a hope More young than hisâthe Child's, the poet's hope,â Lift up his heart again, and lead him on To greatly win,âperchance more greatly lose. When I should else bewail me that I know No longer that high strain of fierce endeavour Which swells the heart of manhood in its prime: The hand to hand encounter with the foe, The strong-armed contest with the briny wave, The duel with some monster of the chaseâ Danger and glory in all forms which give The throb of scores of days of life in oneâ Making a cycle of a span of time,â Then with a sigh I shake my spirit free And stand at guard, or charge with Eurien, Or plunge and spurn with him the caverned wave, Or face with him the fierce, death-breathing bear, And know a joy of triumph in his 'vantage Which overflows my lips while his are silent. But when mine ancient harp of life is swept To subtler issues, when there comes a breath Blowing I know not whence, that even now, Slow-footed, dim of sight, I sigh again To drink sweet poison, and to die from out The world of shock and contest, and arise To taste the double life of angels, then I let my fancy free to soar with Mona; And from her eyes, and hovering wild bird motions, Whose centre is in Eurien, I still catch The self-less ecstacy she knows as love. She came to us across the Irish sea, Beyond the rampart mountains, where we trace them, Faint films upon the mellow evening sky. The daughter of an Eric chief, whose blood It was a point of honour with the Celtic peoples to meet an enemy approaching by sea in the water where the ninth wave broke. Reddened the ruin of the ninth sea wave As it slid over to its fall, and washed The coming feet of Cadwan, who had gone With his bold bands to aid a desperate cause Against marauding Vikings. She, a child, Houseless and friendless by this chance of war, Was snatched by Cadwan as we snatch a dog Forsaken, or a lamb left motherless Upon the hills, and carried o'er the seas To Mona. There she dweltâa cumbrous toy To rough but not unkindly nurses; thence She brought the name she bears among us still. A day had dawned on Eurien's mother Modwyth When earth and sky were dark; slow death had torn A daughter from her widowed hold,âa maiden As fair as Eurien's younger self, when seenâ As once upon a summer noon we saw himâ Doubled in Quellen Lake. For this bright vision The tear-dimmed eyes of Modwyth were a-weary When first they lit on Mona, sent by Cadwan, Her kinsman, in the hope to ease her pain. A scared, white, bloodless elf had Mona seemed In these first days; alack, the child had seen, Heard, felt, and all but tasted gory death; What marvel if the beatings manifold Of the young heart, had robbed the starveling veins? Our lady Modwyth took the maid, and sought, To tame and teach her household works and ways; Took her to home and heart; nay, scarce to heart, She did not love at first those pleading eyes Startled and strange, that lit the wan, peaked face Beneath the pent-house brow, and dusky shade Of wilful hair, and gazed at her where late Her buried darling, Eurien's sister, lay A fading glory all of gold and pearl. Still she was pitiful, and gave the child The best of all she had that was not love,â Shelter, and cheer, and council; that ere long Those seeking eyes grew deep and still with trust. But when they turned on Eurien as he came, A royal stripling, from some mountain course, Fresh from the day-light and the salt sea breath, Tossing aside his golden-threaded hair, Stretching his limbs in calm, luxurious rest, Reaching one patron hand to stroke her head, The other to the hound which from her side Uprose to lay her litter at his feet,â Then Mona's eyes grew deeper yet, and blue, Bluer than blue Glas-lynn when bluest air Veils it from him who gazes from Crib-Coch, And still and patient as some watchful star Which lights us from the furthest depths of space. There fell a day which stands a day apart, Unlike the common throng of those which make, Not mark, the life of age; a day of doom To one, of grief to all of Eurien's house; A day of days, which, spite its rueful end, Hath left its blazon fair no less than foul. Swift messengers from Eurien had gone forth On foot and horse, at earliest dawn, to call A council which should meet in hall at noon, To give award of judgment, and of aid, For Eurien's vengeance on an ancient foe. Some men, the elders, or the graver spirits Of those who owed him service, Eurien thought To summon in his radiant person, charge With his free tongue; so bid me to his side To bear him company upon the way. Our chief was wroth; his forehead cleft with lines Which made his sombre brows to meet as one, And caused his visage, else so frank and fair, To bear the threatening semblance of a cross. We walked in silence, drawing deeper breath Of purer air, and shaking from our feet The dust of lower earth at every step. We clomb in silence; over land and sea O'er mountain peak and jagged side, there hung A luminous mist, and from the valleys seethed A meeting stream of vapour, boiling up And breaking into flakes about our feet. We rose in silence; so we gained the ridge Swept by the icy breath of Moel-Wythfa, Whereon those vapoury billows, lashed and torn,â Precipitated by the driving windsâ We seemed to hold our course amidst dumb breakers, In silence, on a silent, hungry sea. I think that Eurien's eyes of welkin blue Saw little of that wild, phantasmal scene, The dread abysses which perplexed the sense, When suddenly the wind-pierced mist was rent, And mountain streams that bubbled in the coombs Far down below, laughed brightly in our beards; Or rocks surged up, and chasms yawned, where late That sea had foamed at us in voiceless rage. He seemed to feel that tight-clenched hand of his,â Tenacious in its grip as some fair shell,â Close on his foeman's throat, and his firm foot Fall heavy as the huge black Arthu's stone, Crushing the stubborn neck of Cynorac's pride. The ridge that had been was a ridge no more; The misty ocean, open to the right, Was closed upon the left by shelving rocks Which cast their purple shadows on its face. We trod the wild rock path in silence still, The sun above us, we above the steam Which filled the gaping cauldrons of the coombs; He listening to his wrath, I to the lark That tried to sing the fog from out his throat. And as I listened thus, I heard a song Which mocked me with an echo, here, and there, Sounding now near, now far, but growing still, Larger upon the lightening mountain air: A hymn in which the lark's clear-gushing joy Was married to a mood which had been born Of shadow-haunted mountain tarns, and rocks Which glacier drifts had furrowed, and of peaks Which point from age to age their cones to heaven, And topple down from age to age to earth. And hearing of the song, I saw a shade That glided towards us on the rolling mist; A vast and regal shade as of a queen Sceptered and crowned,âand thought that clarion hymn Whose joyance all too keen, broke like a wail, Became this gliding phantom of our hills. But lo! the rocky wall broke off and ceased, And swinging round the path, firm on the blue, Vague, shifting dream-land of the far-off fields, There met us face to face, no mountain queen Of mould majestic, but a lithe, spare sprite, Our maiden Mona, singing as she came, And looking up above our heads, with eyes Whose gaze appeared as though it came from far, And pierced yet farther through the widening blue. The crown upon her head was of the white And purple mountain heather, and her wand An ashen branch, with berries at its point; Her blood-hound, Myneth, joyful at the touch Of Mona's hand, pressed closely to her side, Betwixt the yawning gulf and those light feet Whose heedless steps he guarded; at our view, A starling from her shoulder taking flight Brought down the maiden's eyes to where we stood. She ceased her song; that too had dropped to earth Swifter than swiftest downfall of the lark; Pressed back her hair, and with a furtive hand Stole from her head its blossomy crown, and seemed With drooping eyes, bent brow, and lowered wand, To lay it with her song at Eurien's feet. Her cheek which when we met her, had beenâno, Not pale, but shining white as was the mist,â Was glowing when she lifted up the veil, Dropped on the first shy gladness of her eyes, And fixed themâtwin blue stars with sombre raysâ On Eurien's, which had gathered in one glance Her lowered wand and flowery crown, now buried Deep in the drapings of her skirt, and marked The hound which owning him as lord, returned To crouch and fawn at Mona's unshod feet. Was it some glamour of the misty morn, Or was the maid, who at unwelcome tasks Harried and chidden at the ingle side, Seemed faint and dull of hue, a goddess here,â Worshipped and known to be the soul, the voice, Of that deep-breathing Nature which she loved? Mine ancient eyes in sooth proclaimed her such; But Eurien viewed her in his lusty prime, And saw but little Mona, broken loose, Made fresh and sweet with morning air and dew, And rosy haply with becoming shame, At morning hours so heedlessly enjoyed. And still his eyes that met her mute appeal,â Bold eyes that were not daunted by the sun That smote upon his brow and golden curls,â Grew liquid in the ripple of a smile. He said: âOur mother Modwyth wakes and works Already, and if she had hands as many As bristle round the idols of the Ind, She'd find some service for each hand this day.â Then Mona answered rather with her fleet And forward motion, than her eager words: âI go to help her, Eurien; God speed To thee and me!â So vanished down the slope. We paused upon the shoulder which uplifts The crown of Moel-Wythfa, and drew in The unobstructed air with open lips, And through our eyes the magic draught of beauty. The breeze had swept the way which we had come Clean of the mist, and down beneath our feet The morning faces of the lakes were trembling As new chain-mail that glisters in the sun, And proudly overlooking Llyn-y-Gader, Uprose our ancient towers of Garth-y-Gwin; And, set there as a door betwixt the mountains That opened on the far-off, shining sea, The halls of Carreg-Havod crowned a bryn Where cloven rocks that pierced the fine green sward, Rose bristling like a dragon's deadly spines. My eyes were lingering over vales and summits, My thoughts were wandering wildly through the world, And then they set to Eurien; when I turned, His gaze was fixed, and in his eyes there came A lightânot such as when the sun breaks through To kiss a shadowed pool, but such as brightens Its surface when it curdles in the breeze. I followed Eurien's glances to their mark, And winding slowly down the treacherous sides Of Carreg-Havod, like some insect train,â The blight upon the green sheath of a budâ Beheld a Company,âa mounted dame, Set in the midst of her attendant thralls, Her face towards Garth; and with the dame, a boy, Who, tricksy as an elf, pushed in and out Amongst the mountain ponies, cautious brutes, That felt their way adown the rugged steep. We took no note, but turned upon our course Over the mountain's shoulder, with its crownâ White Moel-Wythfaâat our backs, still rising, Rising and shutting out that face of life. Grave Moel-Hebog,âwherefore lift to-day The brow that hath so long been swathed in clouds, Unveiled above the beech woods? Mona's gaze Is not for thee, although she knows full well How thou and Moel-Wythfa, like two mourners Duly related as to some dead joy Drop mourning weeds together; still she turns not Nor thinks upon that nearest step to heaven Where callow eagles whom the sun makes glad And bold, are learning even now to mount In dizzy spirals towards the light. In vain The magic curtain of the mist unveils The golden shore and silver kissing waves; Or the grey buzzard circles round her head, So nigh it shakes the air which fans her cheek; She knows the cradle of its downy young Beneath the moorland grasses, and the reeds, Where trembling windlets that have lost their way, Trouble the air with their complaining minor. In vain bright eyes illume the shadowy fern, Or glance before her feet in playful challenge; Or laden bees rise up from gorse and heather To tempt her to their distant arsenals; In vain they all, her freakish playmates, strive To win her steps aside; no life that stirs Can reach her dazzled sense through that bright image She bears away this day from Moel-Wythfa: The image of her Eurien, her lord That should be, and her ruler now, nay more, Her sun-god since he lights for her the world. Then Mona tossing to the boy, who blew The horn which told of coming guests, her crown And sceptre, with a smile which made him glad, Entered the dark portcullis, and with feet Whose buoyant tread had left them all unharmed By jagged rocks upon the mountain side, Pressed down the new-strewn rushes of the hall. Modwyth was there, one tall still shape among The moving many who obeyed her word; Who clomb the walls to rid the arch or cusp Of faded relics of the harvest feast; Who bore away the full-topped oaken branch To clear a place for fire upon the hearth; Who fanned the dust, now from the fine chain mail, Now from huge horns and antlers,âsavage arms Of savage beasts; who furbished up a helm, A lance or shield; or thrust a helot hand Within a knightly gauntlet, which the rust Had bitten in too deeply; who shook out A plume, or draped a banner's folds afresh, And made all seemly for the coming day. And Mona, bending for her blessing, felt One hand of Modwyth light upon her head, The while its fellow reached to where a star Of arrows shone above the door, and showed How one of them had swerved; then felt again Two bird-like taps upon her wind-blown hair, And heard the broken formula re-spoken;â Which done, twice bless'd, she rose not blest at all. But waiting with her eyes on Modwyth's glance, Eager to speed its bidding, Mona stood Or hovered with uncertain step or touch About a doubtful task, which half-way done She left at call of Modwyth;âbaffled, âliftedâ From place to place, as 'twere a hound at fault. Ere long the horn was wound upon the turret, Steeds ground the courtyard stones, and stranger voices, One high with eagerness, one shrill with youth, Contended at the door, which opening wide Let in upon them Bronwen and her boy, To flood the hall with chatter, and arrest Its silent service. Bronwen had a store Of griefs and wrongs which loosely in a sheaf Unwinnowed, she in Eurien's absence, laid Before his mother. Of her many griefs Most were loud-tongued, one dumb. The dumb one bore The venomed sting which cankered Bronwen's peace. A weary woman was the fair BronwÃ©n: Widowed well-nigh a year beset with fears; A lordly castle at her back, a mark And prize for ravin; with one little son, Too young to do her service, and one foeâ The common foe of all the country round, Whomâtell it not aloud, this is the grief That stings and has no voiceâwhom Bronwen once Had sought to make her friend, her freer, her championâ The master of her fate,âand he would not. And ravage had been busy nights agone On Bronwen's folds, whereof she asked no question, But set it to the unpaid debt of Cynorac, And came with it to Garth and golden Eurien, To stir him with her tale and with her tears, And beauty softened in the light of his. Then Mona under cover of this cloud, Ventures short flights alone,âa furtive bird Flitting from twig to twig;âretires behind The settle, squares the cushions in the place Where Modwyth sits; ranges her spinning wheel Right to her hand; and ready to her feet The stool about whose carven base is turned The flower-de-luce; then draws the curtain round To shield her from the keen-edged winds that blow Through loop and lancet; when the whole is done In Modwyth's nook beside the hearth, she turns To Eurien's chair that heads the council board, Unveils its broidered glories, and before it Places the footstool with the dragon wrought In threads of gold and grain: âLike this.â she said, Be all base counsel ground beneath his foot!â And near at hand while, silent as the light, Mona had worked, two mocking eyes had marked Her motions; one young lip had curled with scorn Old as the dark old world, at what it held The maiden's simple folly; and a laughâ Born before gladness, or surviving it,â Came chuckling from between the pale puffed cheeks Of Poplet, as he pointed to the stools: âSee Mona, mother,âin her dreams she sets The broidered stool for him, the carved for her!â And Mona feeling ill at ease before Those eyes like plums that had foregone their bloom, Slipt from the hall, to steal within again, Unnoted haply at a distant door, Bearing a posy of such loitering blooms As stay behind the summer: flaming disks Of sunflowers, and dim daisies, scantly prized For all the pride that lifts their heads on high, With golden-rod, and meadow-sweet, and ranged All fairly in a jar, which then she set To catch the sunbeam on the window-sill. And little Poplet, laughing all the while, Clutching his mother's skirts, brought down her eyes To where the maiden, sad-faced Mona, stood, Winning the blossoms gently to her will. But while he laughed, and pointed his small wit, Fair Bronwen smiled, and inly ripened hers. And Mona all unwitting now of eyes Brightening or darkling on her, moved to seek The dried sweet herbs, the marjoram, the rue, The thyme and lavender, that hung on high Hidden within a cranny of the hearth, And threw a handful on the crackling logs Which filled with grateful incense all the hall. At which the imp laughed louder than before, Mopping at her, and capering in the smoke As he had been a witch's changeling, crying: âShe burns the herbs wherewith we savour broth!â Then seeing Modwyth and his mother near, With all the servile throng,âtheir labours done,â Waiting a word to free them, Poplet ceased His dance, and came with side-long twinkling glance To Mona, when he wagged his head, and criedâ Thinking to match their wits to Mona's shame: âI pray you tell us what were now the worth Of a stout ploughman, with a maimed right hand.â And Mona turned on him her eyes, whose light And size were doubled by her gathering tears, And answered: âAs I think, there be no scales Wherewith to weigh the merit of a man; But there are lords would let a heavier heart Count for the churl against a missing limb.â Then straightway to her own there swept a wave, A viewless, silent wave,âas from the souls Uprisen from the trammelled flesh of those Who waited Modwyth's nod, and Mona turning As drawn towards it, caught upon her face The gaze of twenty wistful eyes, and lost The shout which Poplet sent to claim his triumph. And then upon the floor there fell a tread In which each ear confessed, in love or awe, Its lord's approach; and Eurien, the golden, His royal beauty overlayed with signs Of regal office, showed himself, and silence Fell over all as of a summer noon. And pale behind him followed one who showed, With ragged silver locks, and silver beard Spread out upon his robe of bardic blue, Like an old moon all worn with wandering, Beside the dazzling effluence of the sun. And Modwyth drank in light from him, which filled The hollow of her heart; and Bronwen reared Her grandly-pillared head at him, and swelled Her stately form, as might have reared and swelled Some proudly-crested snake which yet could bend Its pride before him till it ate the dust. Which while her son had followed from the hall The servitors, and Mona by the hearth Sunk trembling with an all-subduing joy Which smote through life and limb keen as a pang, I, old GlÃ¢n-Alarch, watched her, crouched aloof, Seeming to pierce the embers' fiery heart, And, as I am GlÃ¢n-Alarch, knew that none Who looked our master in the face, beheld him With such full breadth of knowledge, as the maid Who saw him crowned with glory in the flame. There fell a waiting moment, vague and still, Whose twilight lines, the after-glow of feeling Deepened for some of us: fair Bronwen's babble Wafted to Eurien's sense on fragrant breath, And Mona's eyes that burned like purple gems Between two fires, and Mona's shell-like ear That soothed her as I think with stored-up music,â Breathings of Eurien's lips on tuneful days, Garnered to stay her need in barren seasons. The hour felt heavy-weighted,âloth to pass; It was the boy winding his horn without Who summoned us to meet our coming fate, And welcome to our halls the gathering guests. Weroc strode in; his sunken, wolfish eyes Eager for fight; for he had hungry wrongs A score or twain, ready to take the field In any cause that served him for the nonce As cover for the glutting of his ire: And Peredur and Ruval, maiden knights, Who clanked their armÃ«d heels upon the floor, Pounding the lowly rushes that denied To good war steel its ring; and Cyndelu, Whose mind, as supple as the reeds, still bent Before the breath of other men: and Gryffyth, Fast bound to Eurien by a chain of debt Which gladly he had broken, but forbore, Counting to forge new links with newer need. He stood with cap in hand; while at his side Was one whose tie to Eurien had grown Into his flesh; who sometimes faced his frown, But opened like a blossom to his smile: Wytham of Borth, whom Eurien's arrow wrested Once from the poisonous onslaught of a stag, And whoâthe willing bondman of his loveâ Stood frankly forth, the freest of the free. And still without the door the iron clank Of hoofs, and heels alighting, roused the ear; While creamy draughts of mead and of metheglin Bubbled and foamed within the tankards, crowned By Modwyth's hand, and served to each new guest By Bronwen or by Mona: queenly Bronwen, Her face composed to sadness as beseemed Th' occasion and her wrongs; her fair head curbed A little from her stately throat, most like A flower too long unwatered, that might seem To crave the grace of all that hardy manhood For that it dared to bloom so high. Pale Mona, A maid of mist and moonshine, as they deemed Who saw not in the spirit-light which pierced The fine, too-subtilised flesh, the passionate heat Of the white soul. As these twain thrid their way Amongst the shaggy men with keen wild eyes, And ears grown sharp at lonely bivouac fires, There went with them a honey-laden breath Which weighted with its richness all the air. Our chieftain stood and quaffed his mead in haste, Or turned and spoke a passing word to any Who chanced to be his neighbour; or with instance Pressed flagons of the wine and mead on all; Yet every act and word of him was shaped But to command of knightly courtesy, When, counting heads, he found that all were come. So then he struck upon the hearts of one Or two among his guests, a subtle chord,â For Eurien had lips the Muse had touchedâ And moving with the men his voice had swayed, And Wythan, who was pervious to his thought, And him whose silver beard was ever set Beside his golden one, we four assumed Our stations at the board, and led the rest Then, ere the Councilmen were fully set, Modwyth stood forth: a woman whom the years If they had found more fair, had left more noble. The mettle of her race so oft had leapt Unshrinking at the sacrificial call Of honour, that the brow she now uplifted Was grandly dinted, as a hero's shield. Her voice was pitched that all might hear, her eyes Addressed her son: âThy mother claimeth not,â Albeit she brought a thanedom to her dowerâ A place beside thee at the Council board, Content to hold her right beside the hearth, Not heedless of your wisdom as it flows.â Some bent them to the lady as she stood, Some turned and faced her son in churlish doubt; But one young voice,â'twas Wythan'sârang out clear: âGod save our lady Modwyth!â Eurien paused A moment ere he said as overborne: âYour place in Garth is where you choose to take it.â Then Modwyth, faltering somewhat as she caught The trouble of his eye, looked round the board: âMy sire and spouse were heroes, and my sonâ Mine only sonâcould be no less; God wot My pride would have him more, if more might be. My widowed presence, damping not his fire, Will haply temper what might burn to waste.â âGod save our Lady Modwyth!â cried again The bold young voice which shamed our silent Council; And Modwyth turned, and making sign to Bronwen And Mona to attend her, drew her wheel, And, throned in humble duty, set her pale, Proud, stedfast face against the flickering blaze. So to the high-pitched voices at the board The wheel made dull companionment, like life With its half-conscious motions, that confuse The sense of tragic issues of the will. Still keenly on her ear, where Eurien sent them, Not heedless of his aim, his words had struck, When he recounted how the jealous thanes Her forbears, guarded as a sacred trust Each appanage pertaining to the fiefâ Bought by the blood of those whose bodies now Were mingled with the soil they held in fee For generations of their unborn seed. And then he showed how Cynorac had reaped The grain, scarce ripened, from outlying fields, How felled the trees his father's hands had planted, How come at night to vex him with unmaking The work his thralls had toiled at through the day; And lastly, when reprisals had been taken By some who had the honour of their lord More than the safety of their bones at heart, How he had caught and sent them home, sewn up In skins of beasts filched living from the flocks. All this forsooth because a widow held The lands and kine so plundered, and 'twas thought A son would tamely take a mother's wrongs! So would not he, by Heaven, if they, his friends, Would help him to chastise his foe and theirs; For Cynorac was like a fox, who spared No roost, albeit it liked him best to prey On the defenceless. Widows were his spoil; Not every widow had a man-grown son; Some had their hands o'erweighted with the care Of helpless orphans. One he knew of these: She sate beside his mother at the hearth Of which she claimed the shelter. They were men, And British men, whom long adversity Had rendered pitiful; there was not one But felt that he was summoned as by name,â Father, or brother, husband, as might be,â To right a woman who, if she should speak Those words, could speak them only of the dead! Then none so rude or stern of all that band, But turned when Eurien ceased, with softened mien To look upon the gracious woman there, Bending to dry the cheeks that seemed to freshen Beneath the mild o'erflowings of her eyes. Then Weroc blundered in to mar the picture So lightly touched by Eurien, who, with cunning Of speech-craft, had of choice prolonged the moments Whose beats were cyphers added to a sum. The words of Weroc,âhe whom no man loved,â Were heavy with a hoard of well-worn wrongs, Which, touching only Weroc, none else cared To make his own. And so from time to time The hatchet strokes of Weroc's speech were broken By shafts from some keen-witted hearer, turning His weapon on himself; while glistening eyes Looked on well pleased, or a low laugh broke out From lips too lightly guarded; till the fire In Weroc's heart leapt up in evil flame, And the grave council met to quell disorder Seemed hurrying on its course to make it more. And ever as the voices of the men Grew louder, fiercer, still the wheel of Modwyth Spun fast and faster, as unwittingly The heart well learned in sorrow set the damper Of outward act to dull the chord of pain. But Mona left the carding of her wool And listened as with every sense at once, While Bronwen, tending with a smooth observance On Modwyth's need, plenished anew the distaff, And swiftly set it to her trembling hand, Yet with a glance oblique still filched the news Which might concern her at the council board. In vain the voice which Eurien could tune To any key of music, now was raised In bland persuasion, now in sharp command; The angry answers crossed like chopping waves, And wild misrule appeared the only lord. So through the tumult none had caught the note, Though sharp as sea-bird's scream above the storm, Which sounded from the bugle on the turret, And knew not till the iron-guarded gate Groaned on its hinges and let in a gust Of Autumn wind that carried a red shower Of withered leaves, which sadly it let fall, That warning had been sent them from without. There, dark against the cold and watery light Silvering the edges of his panoply, Driven as 'twere before that bodeful shower, Announced as by the moaning of the wind, A knight on horseback, pale and sad as death, And misty as a spectre in the smoke Wreathing his charger, rode into the hall And struck his spear with force upon the flags, As one who fain had propped his ebbing strength Against the stedfast earth, and rooted there. And then a cry which was not of the wind, Long-drawn and freakish, but the sharp outburst Of a pent human soul, that rushes forth Incontinent, unwitting, at the touch Of human brotherhood, came from the man; And suddenly the petty gusts of passion, Which eke had blown from every point at once, Were quelled before that masterful, sole breath; And hands of fellowship were laid about His knees, and lowering eyes looked up to catch An answer to dumb fear, while every heart Recoiled before the yet unworded sorrow, Which each man felt instinctively his own. So words flung forth, and torn with now a sob, And now a curse, but pieced and held together With shreds of knowledge common to us all, Made up at length the story of a wrong More brutish, nay more devilish, than any Of that long train by which the Sassenach Had marred for Cymric hearts the peace of Christ. Twelve hundred monks of Bangor, men of God, His ministers that were, His martyrs now,â Slain at His altar,âslain before His eyes, Kneeling to ask for judgment of their cause There where their butchers were as free to kneel, But that they dared not tempt high God in face. Twelve hundred martyrs! Men whose holy hands When not uplift in prayer, were set to feed The hungry, and to smoothe the brow of pain,â Slain by the sword, who never took the sword, Slaughtered like lambs at pasture on the hills! The brutal Saxon, Ethelfrith, the leader Of the vile scum which makes our wholesome borders A foul morass, from out his swinish sleep Awakened by the voices of these saints Rising on morning breath with fragrant thyme And all sweet savours of the dawning day, Cried out: âThese monks, they fight us with their prayers, Which we make bold to answer with our swords!â IâBard of Glynethâcharge thee,âGod of heaven, That in Thy sovereign prescience, not alone Thou shalt fulfil the prayers of saints stopped short Upon their road to Thee, but that for once Those eyes which are too pure to look on evil, Shall gaze unflinching,âso thou shalt not fail To answer with Thy sword these fiends of hell! Our ancient Bangor levelled and despoiled, The records of our learning and our pride,â The story of the years that are no more,â Lapsed into sullen silence for all time! The God-won flame of thought, inherited And fed by us to light the world to come, Blown out, with nought but ashes left to darken The storm, or trodden dust for us to heapâ Heap on the mountain of our huge despair! We stood and heard the tale, then slowly turned All white and dumb to face each other's anguish; And in dead silence of our rigid lips We sounded the black depths of our revenge. But winds were blowing, wild and contrary, In Eurien's soul, which made his bold young glance To flicker from mine own, grown dull with time, But all as steadfast as the evening sun, The red bleared orb which looks from out the mist. Our chieftain's face was like a dubious morning, When lion-like he shook his tawny locks, And stroking with a hand which trembled still The waves from out his beard, he seemed to fight As if against the storm which had o'ertaken The purpose of our souls, and struggle back To find it in the wreck, and once more draw us With that abiding power which he owned Within th' unswerving current of his life. He spoke, while all aroundâe'en to the logs, Which broke into a sudden flame, and ceasedâ Was still, as if the hollow hall had grown, The empty waiting chamber of an ear. He reached his handâhis wrath still struggling in it, And took from off the board whereon it lay Guarding some runic scrolls, a thing which but The use it owned made other than a toy;â A fancy wrought in silver,âa white hand An object similar to that which is here described is now among the British antiquities in the British Museum. Mocking the one which held it, while in turn It pressed within its dainty clasp, a ball Which was not of its metal, but of lead. âI take within mine own,â quoth he, âthis hand, And place it, deadly weighted as ye see it, Beneath my vesture, pressing on my heart; So by the God who watches over men,â Though fiends have done what might bespeak them blind, I swear to nurse my vengeance till the hour Is ripe to hurl it on the Sassenach; Meanwhile it will go hard but I shall add Some scruple to its measure day by day.â A groan almost, what might have been a cheer In happier moment, broke from us; then Eurien: âGood friends we have a rede to rede, albeit It comesâGod save the mark!âfrom vain Brocmail, Who never, as I think, could furnish wisdom To any, an 'twere not the backward way. He, fool and victim of his jealous heart, Athirst to crown himself with unshared honour, Has dared to face this devil, Ethelfrith, Unbacked, and with his sorry men of Powis To brave the high spring tide of Saxon wrath Bursting at last upon the rampart hills Whose base it long has howled about in vain. âLearn we from his defeat to bide our time! And when each canker of the heart is purged, Then fare we forth to quell the rampant foe,â A healthy body, working to one end, And knit together in each breathing part With the strong purpose of a due revenge. But from this end, which, witness heaven, shall ever Be counted as the harvest of all hope, Weânever turningâstill will swerve awhile Like crafty fowlers; so good friends at dawn, To-morrow, we will still fare forth, and try The temper of our swords on Cynorac.â A crash as of a fall beside the hearth,â A spindle haply, or a wheel which rang Against the flags whereon in blinding impulse Unheeded, known or seen, it had been cast, We heard, we saw no more, till at the board, At Eurien's side, there stood a white-robed shape, Which silently as drifts the feathery snow, Had floated to that place,âa nymph-like form We knew, and did not know. It was not Mona Who turned the eyes which had become as wells Of awful depthâof sorrow too profound, And rage too patient, for a mortal maidâ Full on our faces; no, not she, our merle, But dread Cyridwen, genius of our race, Descended there to front us with our shame. She stood and spoke no word, though the wan lips We deemed had overflowed with living thought, Heaved from a heart we knew was big with it, Moved as for speech; the heart was all too thronged, Too full for utterance; so, dumb at the lips, She lifted from her side her Irish harp, When from beneath her fingers there broke forth A wail which matched the message of her eyes. Alas! it was our merle, our singing-bird! For though she held us by a sovereign spell,â A passion so supreme, it overwrought The rudest spirit in the grossest clay Of any there who drew the breath of man, Even to down-faced Weroc,âit was still Our Mona, charging all the air around With fine electric thrills, but no immortal; We learnt that from the beating of her heart. White as Crag-Eyrie in the breathless night When the late harvesters are at their work, And the dusk dome of heaven, whence all the stars Have fled before the magic of the moon, Sweeps darkly down as sweeps the smooth-tressed hair Framing the lurid forehead of a corpse: Even so white and darkly framed she waited With patient purpose till her tongue was loosed. Then Weroc, shamed throughout his churlish nature That he, for but a moment, had been awed By the dumb presence of a brainsick girl, Rose with an oath, and muttered taunt at those Who struggled still to free themselves, and failed. But ere he went she turned, and putting forth Her slender arm,âsuch potence of command Had grown in herâshe stopped him on his way; And now the flood-gates of swift speech broke down, And words welled forth that sounded strangely first, As shot in sudden jets beside the mark,â But words which as they flowed, and gathered force, Caught from her burning heart a bardic fire. âThey have hunted you to your hills, ye men of Glyneth! Your rivers and plains are the spoil of the Sassenach; And they laugh like slaves in the face of him that winneth.â She paused, like a young bird that tries its wing For longer flight; then struck her harp and sung. âYou have fattened for them your fields, ye men of Glyneth, Your dead have covered the soil as a fruitful flood, And the rivers that dance in the sun and look not back, Are fuller for tears, and richer for running blood. âThey have sent ye to herd with the bear, ye men of Glyneth, With the wolf and the mountain fox in their rocky holds; The bog, with the lean wild cat, for your share, men of Glyneth, For them, your cities, your kine, and your ravished folds! âYe have housed with the beast in his lair, ye Cambrian braves, Or have hunted him down on the hills in his own wild track; Inherit his mountains bare and his empty caves; But his brotherless spiritâlet that to the earth go back! âIf the rush and the lily now flower on tarn and burn Where he slaked his thirst, and the fight ye have all but won, It is that his savage heart had not depth to learn To look for the brother who lives in each mother's son.â Once more the burthen failed; once more the hand Took up the strain, and shook from out the harp Sounds that compelled our spirits more than words. She struck another key, and then again Broke forth in language proper to the earth: âDull is the Sassenach, be it as lover or foe, And ye, my brothers, are quick unto love and ire; Would ye come to the Sassenach's aid because he is slow? Would ye lend to his sullen wrath your own wild fire? âYe are weary of laggard love, and of long-drawn strife, So crown his work and have done,âye are heroes and free! But what of the bondman's hope in his trodden life? And oh, for the eyes of our kindred over the sea! âLet the hopes they have garnered be blown to the winds like chaff, Perish, self-slain, and so fade from the longing eyes! Die! with the sound in your ears of the Sassenach laugh, And the requiem, tuneful for ever, of Cymric sighs; âTurn the sword each man on his fellow, and make an end; It is fitting that hero should perish by hero's hand; So leave ye to Sassenach mercy the lover or friend, And to slow heart-sickness your brothers on alien strand; âUnheeding the lesson of war, and the legend of peace, And the sacred torch of your lore which from age to age Has been handed on, let the light of your spirit cease, As the saint and the soldier have perished, so perish the sage! âForget your olden glory, ye men of Glyneth, Cast the torch from the armed right hand ere it flickers or fails, Stamp it out and end the story, O men of Glyneth, Let Cambria fall like a stronghold that treason assails, And in tears of your shame shall your land be rechristened wild Wales!â Wales, Wales, wild Wales! she ended with that cry, A cry to haunt the memory, and to bring Tears to the eyes in lieu of sleep at night. Wales, Wales, wild Wales! Her hearers knew full well The land she sung of was the bleeding heart Of Britain, Britain mangled by the foe, Torn limb from limb, the parts still quick with life, Throbbing in all sad corners of the earth. And ending thus she swept from out the hall, Proud and uplifted as a wave that rears Its foam-capped crest, and glides before the storm; But glides before the storm to break at last, To sink, and to subside in helpless ruin. As yet she was unbroken, and sped on With head erect, enlarging as she went, Till sudden at the door she turned, thrown back Even as a breaker wrecked upon a bar, And reaching forth her arms, her eyes abashedâ Their fire all quenched in tears whose light was loveâ She lifted trembling hands towards our chief, And all her woman's soul flowed out before him, Craving his grace that it could soar so high. Our chieftain rose, and, breathing a deep breath, Like a strong swimmer who has stemmed the tide, Struck himself free from her subsiding passion, And gave her back her gaze with one that set The brand of some displeasure on her brow; As he in taking back a wandering slave Had marked her that she might not stray again. Then yielding to the urgence of her eyes, He signed her pardon with his hand, and said: âBeseech you, friends, give quittance for her youth And scanty knowledge of the ways of men, Which, with her early baptism of blood, Hath wrought her fervid soul to such high pitch As borders on distemper, that at whiles She oversteps those bounds which God has set, And men approve becoming in a maid.â Then Mona, all the forces that had moved her Lapsed into utter weakness, wavered still A moment, holding Eurien with her eyes, Then turning, fled from his averted face, And heard the clamped and iron-grated door Swing on its hinges with a groan that stirred Her heart with pity of herself; and tears Came thick, as falling prone upon the ground, Now abject as a wave that licks the shore, She thought upon the bar which shut her off From all that love had made her paradise, And lying on the stony earth she wept: âWhat if his smile should sun me never more?â She lay awhile and made her moan, then started, Feeling the grip of little hands, ungentle, Hot on the fingers which embayed her tears, And shut from her the darkened world without. Then Poplet, holding in his rude boy's grasp The conquered guardians of her eyes, cried mocking: âMerle as you are, before I let you fly You shall confess what folly they have chidden.â But Mona struggled from his hold, and fled As she in truth had been that wingÃ«d thing, And on a path unknown to Poplet, placed A woody screen betwixt them, and ascended The mountain high, and higher. As she went, Her pulses stirred by valorous defiance Of frowning dangers of the mountain brow,â Her heart grew lighter; when she looked below, Poplet was grown a midge, no more, then vanished Wholly from sight awhile, to reappear Upon the turret, snatching from the boy The horn, whereon he blew a lying signal. The maiden laughed and said within herself: âPraised be the shelter of thy crown, Crag Eyrie! Thy breath is keen and difficult, but sweet,â And sweeter that it is not loved of flies!â Then making straight the course that had been devious, She clomb to where the sun in his decline Shone on the rising sea, whose surface crisped With waves innumerous was as a mirror Shattered, as if to multiply his beams. So mounting still she gained the frowning Clogwyn, And saw the world outspread, with, near at hand, The cliffs and coombs, far off the rolling surge Of mountains, fixed as fossil waves, all glowing In pomp of purple, or of burning gold, Or melting into vapour on a sky Swept by the besom of the autumn wind. And all about her steps the cloven rocks, And far beneath the lakes, the shining sea; While as she went the mountains seemed to sway, To heave and fall as with a solemn rhythm, And change their places in her upward course. And Mona, rocked as by the moving world Of mountains, and the scud of sea and cloud, Felt as she rose and rose above the vale, The air weigh lightlier on her brow, the rock, Springy as air beneath her wingÃ«d feet; So the strong heart of Nature entered in The maiden's breast, and set her life in order. She paused upon the Clogwyn, where the breeze Lifted the hair from off her brows, dark wings As of a bird impetuous in its flight; And then she said,ânot wholly to herself, Nor yet aloud, but as we speak to one Standing too near our heart to need set forms,â âO hills and sea, and shore! familiar features, Nature, of that dear face which is the all I know of thee; which would be still thy face, Thy very faceâno meaner part of theeâ Though I should learn to know thee glorious 'Neath torrid skies, or bound in glittering ice. Some sun-kiss'd lands are fairer it may be; I know with them the seasons hold a course More equal, as the actions of the body Are timelier than the motions of the lips. Thou art not calm and image-like as they, Thou ownest not their rule of smiles and tears,â Broken, where most it binds, with fierce convulsions; But thou, loved face, art fickle as the wind, And frownest as thou smilest, changefully, Weeping, and laughing through thy tears by fits, With turns of passion, or of sullen woe, When, with a veil thou blottest out thy beauty E'en from the eyes whose sight it blesses most. So art thou richer, fuller in response, To mortals blown upon by change, like thee. O tender face and shy, I love thee more That thou, as I, art sad at whiles, and seekest To hide thy sorrow; both of us would sing, Would sing and wake an echo from the stars If for us both the sun were ever free!â And then a-weary with her rapid course, And heavy that her sun was in eclipse, She sunk upon the ground, and laid her head As she might lay it on a mother's breast, Soft on a bank all springy and a-bloom With ling, and sweet with fragrance of the peat; And there not listening, looking, hardly living But as a part of Universal Being, She felt the sun that glinted on the sea, The distant waves that dallied with the shore, The vapoury drift, like cobwebs on the blue, The silent shadows wandering o'er the hills, And tenderer, homelier than the sighs tumultuous Of winds which won through rifts of autumn leafage, She heard the wandering breeze that swept her brow Ring tuneful through the bells of mountain heather, And thought the only mother she had known,â Wild Natureâas she nestled to her heart, Sung her to rest with that soft lullaby. But sounds more earthly came to vex her peace; And Mona from her balmy pillow rose To look and listen like a startled hind; And heard the panting of a labouring heart At battle with the mountain's rugged side, Then saw the sleek, preened head of Bronwen, rising Slowly above the rock, and the two eyes That caught a stonier glitter meeting hers, Closing upon her while the face recoiled,â Shrunk back,âas might have shrunk the small barbed head Of some fair-painted beast before it struck. And Mona, gazing, trembled as a bird That fronts the foe foredoomed of all its kind, But trembling, still advanced a helpful hand To steady Bronwen's unaccustomed steps, As one who does the honours of her home. The woman past her by, and set her back Firm to the rock; Mona gave way, and left The breadth of all the level space betwixt them; Then kneeling, rested on the giddy verge, But wound her arm about a sapling ash Deep-rooted in a fissure of the rock; And thus she faced her foe, and gave her back A gaze more firm, more potent than her own, Flashed from a heart that owned more living fire, And steadied by a soul that would not swerve For danger, though her strength were overmatched. The maiden was a merle but in her song, And in the prescience of her tuneful spirit; Woman to woman was the duel now. So Mona waited watchfully, while Bronwen, Who first had sought her as we chase a child, Felt driven by the question of her eyes To answer straightly wherefore she was come To trespass on the peace of her retreat. She spoke; a little fading of the rose Whose wont it was to keep unaltered state On Bronwen's cheek; some catching of the breath Spent by the way, betrayed that now she owned The need of each reserve of craft and cunning. âI've tracked you, panting, up this irksome path, Fit but for bare-boned beasts who hunt for life; I am too much your friend to let you wander In desperation, knowing of no shelter Where one outcast from Garth would be let in.â And Mona answered her: âOutcast from Garth?â But as an echo answering from the hills Which seems to mock the sound that gave it birth. Then Bronwen: âYea, I said outcast from Garth; Not wholly of their will who are its lords; For that same pity which of old time opened The arms of Modwyth, leaving cold her heart, Would open to you still, and take you back. But by my heart I gauge the height of yours; The blood of Connaught kings would surely scorn Not less than mine, the burthen of a debt Your nature hath denied you to repay.â Here Bronwen paused; she saw how Mona's eyes Were set a-far, as if her gaze could pierce The mountains' heart, and thought âShe reads her fate By the new light wherein my wit hath set it.â But Mona caught no light from Bronwen's words; She only bent more near, and said, with voice That fluttered and was tender with appeal: âWhat of the council,âthey will hold their lives, And blood of their brave hearts, in fee for Britain?â Then Bronwen eyed her doubtfully, scarce knowing If she were matched with an adept, who sought To flout the world of reasonable folk, With shadows men agreed to christen âholy,â Or ifâmore likeâthis maiden were a thing So strange and unrelated to her kind, That craft itself was baffled by her folly. And Mona said again: âTell me of Eurien; He shamed each man that looked but to his own,â He swayed all hearts to work the work of God?â Then Bronwen scornfully: âHe is a man Himself, our Eurien, ay, a very man; For all his golden curls and heaven-blue eyes, He is no carved and painted cherub, made To smile and stare while robbers sack his shrine. At peep of day to-morrow, he, and all Who find their best account in Eurien's favour, Armed, mounted, and in secret, will fare forth And settle odds with Cynorac.â Mona said No word, but on her face there fell a veil Like that the face of nature which she loved Spread when she travailed in mysterious woe; And soothingly, as one might still a babe, Who reading anguish in its mother's eyes, Gives noisy voice to what she inly feels, She laid her slim white hand athwart the harp About to wail an answer to the wind. Then Bronwen's voice, grown bold through Mona's silence: âModwyth is wrath at you, as Eurien is; She holds you to have shamed her matron teaching, Lifting your voice unmaidenly, in defiance Of men as full of wisdom as of honour, Some, reverend with years. And worse, yet worse,â A rank offence that time alone may mendâ Eurien is shamed of you, his place and office Usurped, the mandate of his mouth reversed, His motives set at naught, held up and shaken Before his face in scorn, while he and all The chivalry of Wales are hailed as beasts Because like men they battle for their own. This flame of wrath will not be quenched to-day, Our hope must be to stay its further havoc; I am your friend, and they who know me such, Now wish me speed in this: that I may win you To bide with me at Havod till this fire Burn itself out. You will not be beholden To me as eke to them; my life is lonely,â A widowed womanââ Mona suddenly: âI have not shamed him! None may Eurien shame But Eurien's self. It was not he who spoke Of his great heart those straightened words,ânot he Of his free self,âsome warlock had conjured, Subdued him with a spell, and used his tongue. I thought that I was dumb; I know at first Speech fluttered at my heart, but lost the way From out my lips, that thenââ She struck a chord, The same wild call which Weroc had obeyed. âI knew not that I spoke, a bird's shrill note Had all sufficed to wake him from such bonds. Yet wherefore did he look on me in wrath? Hah! was I held like him,âhe forced to speak The words that did him wrong, I, like to one In evil dream, unable to give forth The cry which cleft my heart, that so I left him Unsuccoured in the grasp of some fell fiend? But yet I tell you, Eurien will not go To crush a gnat that stings him while the heart Of Britain lets forth life; his love is fervid, His soul is high, and made to serve high ends; Not such as he are mastered by a weird, Albeit they mayââ Then Bronwen with a voice That clanged against and quelled her silvery speech: âMaiden, well said, our chieftain's love is fire; Therein hath lain the secret of the spell Which makes him put aside for once, the call Of bleeding Britain, while a living love Hath wrongs his strong man's heart would first redress.â Then there was silence on the lonely Clogwyn, While eyes relentless as the grip of death Fastened on Mona; but her face was dark, The sun behind her finding out red gleams Of colour in her hair,âa saintly nimbus Brightening towards martyrdom; her head was drooped Low on her bosom; all that Bronwen noted Was how the ashen stock that was encircled By Mona's arm, trembled against the sky. Then Mona faintly: âEurien owns no love Would pit her wrongs against the wrongs of Britain; Modwyth is noble, and ââ âAnd is his mother! And Mona half his sister, half a merle! One is a household thing a man is born to, And takes unnoted as he takes his breath; The other is a creature of the air, Brought up beside his hearth,âand still untamed. 'Tis not for loves like these a man will cast His country to the winds, his soul away! But you, poor child, what mean such words to you, Who never knew the warmth of mother's arms, Far less that answering glow which kindles us Who stand within that fiery sphere, whose centre Is a man's heart a-blaze with love!â Then Mona: âHe loves me, he is pitiful; not so, But custom is no bar to tender hearts; He loves me! I was little when I came, No higher than my heart is now; and weak, And sickly, and I had not learnt to sing! How had I grown if I had felt no warmth? How had I gotten strength and learnt to sing If light had never shone on me? They lie Who say he loves me not; his love is deep, Patient, and calm, as deathless things alone May dare to be!ââ Said Bronwen: âVery patient Is Eurien's love, if love he own for you! Patient, and heavenly calm. â'Tis now three years Since you exchanged your troth; you marvel not That he should sit beside you at the ingle,â A saint who having nought to do but pray, Forgets to tell his beads. To you it seems Not strange that he should let the seasons grow, From hot to cold, and speak no word of marriage. Truly, a love seraphic! I were happyâ Ay, to the topmost bent of happinessâ If Eurien's calm and patient love, that looks For full fruition in some far-off sphere, Were yours, the while I lay within his arms, And felt against mine own his beating heart!â Then suddenly aloud on Clogwyn Cromlech, A mingled cry, the shriek of tortured pines, And Mona's wind-swept harp, and it might be Some passionate escape of Mona's breath, Rising together in a wail of woe That dashed itself against the stony hills, Which muttered to each other of her pain. But Bronwen's stonier heart made no response; Though the swift-passing shadow of great wings Darkened her brow a moment, as the eagle Swooped towards its nest in terror for its young. And Mona, risen to her feet, spoke out, And, like a baited thing that makes appeal From some harsh judge, she wandered with her eyes About the crowded hills in search of pity. âHe loves me! He can never prove that false,â Not hers his heart, but mine,âmy promised home; Let her not dare to speak of trespass there! He loves me. Whose the name which first he calls Returning from the mountains? Whose the hand He trusts with all behests which touch him nearest? No arrow that I have not winged and pointed Will Eurien arm him with; he will not draw A bow I have not stringed; take a false fly To lure his fish with, that I have not made. My fingers are not quick and deft as hers, My eye so ready, I have little cunning In women's works and ways; how should I earn His praise alone, but that his love creates The skill my hands are lacking in for others? He loves me; oh, he loves me; I am here,â I could not be alive without his love!â And then she sank again upon the ground, And clasped her breast, and locked her sorrow there. Then Bronwen: âChild, he loves you as his hound, Stroking your head when you have served him well; Or as his falcon that he blinds with jesses, Then perchesâblindly happyâon his wrist; So are you hood winked; but I tell you this: If Eurien loved you in another sort,â Loved you as man loves woman,âif his eyes Grew hungry as he gazed on you, his kisses Clung to your lips,âit would be he not you Who did this yeoman's service,âyou who set him All blind and dazed with love, to bide your bidding. And you who hold him dear, I tell you too,â You think you love him, but you love him not; Else were you full content with all he did:â His lowest act were high enough for you!â Mona was silent, holding down her heart Which beat as though it beat against a rock; The world went round with her, the mountains heaved; What need of words to justify her pangs? She died for, but she had not so learned love. Bronwen again: âHe loves you as a man Of eager purpose loves the thing that rears Itself against his will; loves you as one May love the ghost that holds him to the promise Of his green, careless youth, and dims the light That might have gilt his present and his future. O Mona!â Bronwen's voice broke here, and took A sudden prayerfulness; her words were sowing Conviction in herself,âa shallow crop As suited to the soil,âbut still conviction Which served the cause she pleaded:â âHear me, Mona, Beseech you do not stand betwixt us twain, Making life dark for both! Have you no eyes?â No natural cunning such as teaches women To snatch the meaning of an unlearnt lesson? You read the runes, and shame with studious lore Our able-handed but unlettered lords, Yet fail to read that Eurien's soul recoils From such vain boasts of learning as he shares not; That Eurien loves a humble port in women, Nor that alone, but loves a lowlier mind In creatures lowlier born. You have grown up A fledgling at his hearth, so loved and cherished, So to be loved again;âbut as his wife! No, things so cross in nature are not joined, Or joined but to be rent apart for ever. O Mona, I could make his life a joy, Loving him as we love who are no better Than women, setting up nor scale nor measure For those above us. I would make his home A resting-place from each uneasy effort; The very eagle cannot hold his weight For ever in the sky; and Modwyth too Should cease from care as feeling that a hand More strenuous than her own was guiding all. I love him, and I tell you he loves me; I to his eyes own kinship as a magnet, That draws upon its path their fiery steel; He turns from you unmoved, to find and claim His part in me; mark too how Modwyth's face Looks coldlier on you day by day; she learning To see in you the clog of Eurien's joyâ A joy, the birthright of his meanest thrall. Have you no virgin pride that you should bind His honour when his heart is in revolt?â The rush of words broke over her unheard; Mona had risen from her lowly seat, And standing on the verge, her soul past forth Over the golden bridge which crossed the sea. There fell a lull; a moment of deep calm; The winds that had been loud awhile agone Now held their breath; what lesser grief would dare To break the silence of a widowed love? Sweet Christ! But there is woe so great, it rends The bands that bind it; darkness that fulfils So vast a sphere that it must somewhere touch The skirts of light! The tokens of such woe, Such darkness, now fell on the face which Mona Turned to the sun that hasted to his end I' the flaming pyre of clouds which waited still To crown him with far-reaching shafts of glory. The stillness seemed to lighten all the air; The vacant hush to make more room for life, But life that soared beyond the reach of thought; The tinkle of a sheep-bell in the vale Was all the sound that beat the march of time. Through Mona swept a thrill of parting love So keen, so rare, that if it was a pang It was a pang undying, and so wore The awful beauty of immortal things. And a new revelation rose within her: The Psalm of Life was opened to her ear; She knew the mystery of the tuneful spring, The deep, full pulsing of the summer eve, And autumn's teeming, consummated lifÃª, And winter's hope congealed within its heart. Then suddenly she drew her life, outspread Upon the universe, within herself; Gathered her thoughts, and turned with searching question On Bronwen as she stood, all over-streamed By golden sunbeams, set against a bank Pranked with the ruddy tips of whortle leaves. So weighed the woman's charms, their power and worth; The brow no thought had knit, the furtive eyes Softened by lengthening shadows of the hour; The clear ripe cheek, and lips the autumn sun Was hotly kissing: eyes, and cheeks, and lips That were not faint or fierce with famished love; Then marked the pillared throat, and stately sweep Of shoulder, and the plenteous bosom, heaved With quiet breath; all smooth and fair and sheeny In the full blossom of her earthly beauty. As Mona gazed her own young eyes grew dull, Her cheek and lip wan as with loveless years; A sickness of the heart, a chill, a dimness, A motion of the stedfast things without;â And still through all she saw that woman blaze In the all-conquering charms which lure men's love; Herself a creature only born to feel Love's shaft, and perish of its wound, not one A man were proud to heal upon his heart. Alas! she was not lovely, save to eyes Of love; to such, I think no shadowed pool Whose darkling screen the sun has broken through, Thatâseized with sudden longingâhe might kiss Its face, had sent so brave an answer back! But darkness now lay thick on Mona's soul, For all the light that bathed the world was Bronwen's, And Bronwen's glory seemed to blind her eyes And sing its mocking pÃ¦ans in her ears. Only through all the anguish and the strife And dimness of her soul, she grasped and held One thought: âHe shall not lose his life for me, God give me strength to die and leave them so,â And first to fly,âbut whither?â Then her eyes Swept the horizon's verge, and felt the world A desert of all howling miseries, And with her hands she warned it off from her,â The weird, wild world, and bright calm woman there Who mocked her with the beauty that he loved,â She pushed it from her, and her steps recoiledâ A shriek !âIt was not Mona,âshe was gone, Gone from the giddy verge, gone, gone from pain, And giddiness of unpreparÃ«d act, Caught up! yea, God, I say it yet again, Caught up from her despair, caught up by Thee, Rapt, lifted by Thine arm, great God for whom There is nor high nor low, above, beneath, Darkness or death, but only light and love! And Bronwen was alone on Clogwyn Cromlech, Bathed in the sun's red glow from head to foot; Clinging with hands convulsed to the wild growths Behind her, as she stared upon the orb That searched her with his unobstructed beam, And on the lonely ashen-stock that stood Upright against the sky, and looked unmoved Upon the horror of the depths below. And as she clung and trembled, clung and broke Now and anon the stillness, with a cry, Feebler, more smothered as the moments past, She came to feel the warmth upon her heart, And her slow-pacÃ«d blood began to move Once more within her veins, and shudderingly, As one nigh drowned returns again to life, She saw as writ on the uncovered sky The ordered course of prosperous days to come; And her set lips, bereft of the warm tint Which masked their coldness, showed all pitiless With greed, and leanings hard and obdurate As those of savage creatures that disdain not To nourish their low lives upon their kind. And there alone, alone on Clogwyn Cromlech, With nought between her and the dread abyss Where Mona and her love lay bound in death, Bronwen still trembled, groaning as in pain, Yet heard a voice half-stifled, all unbidden, Speaking from out some secret depth unknown: âAs now you are alone on Clogwyn Cromlech, So now you are alone in Eurien's love.â And then she crept, still holding by the tufts Of verdure in the rocks, and dyed her hands With blood of strangled berries as she went,â Crept with such speed as shaking limbs and feet Unused could master, down the mountain slope, And saw her craven shadow quivering Beside her on the rock, and heard aghast The uncertain echo of her steps behind her, But dared not turn to look, lest she should see Some demon form, or, all being yet so new, Some slender woman shape less welcome still. Then I, GlÃ¢n-Alarch, met her; her white brow Dashed with the guilty colour of her hands; Grasping the rocky ledges, and the stems Of herbage, and descending scared and haggard, Stumbling with haste and terror. So we two Bore wildly to the house at Garth a tale Which raised it, and the country all around. And I that am GlÃ¢n-Alarch know not well What then I heard, what gathered, as I gleaned The field of after knowledge; or ere garnered For use as now, how much I winnowed out Of chaff to find the grains of truth; but know That, being GlÃ¢n-Alarch, never word could set me On any act of Mona, but the clue Guiding her spotless soul thereto, would come Straight to my hand as quickened by my love. For even as man must be, or else God's world Were not, as now it is,âwanting the soul Whereto it makes appeal,âso we who sing Are as the very dew-drops of mankind, Which mirror all, andâ Nay, I can no more! The hall was empty, but disordered still By the late presence of the council guests; With reek of viands heavy in the air, And luscious fumes of mead. There Bronwen stood And told her tale again, with loud-voiced grief, Stammering, with chattering teeth, and quivering chin. And Modwyth heard, and dropped as one struck down By the last stroke of doom; but Eurien made With feet that were as wings, for the lone hollow That yawned beneath the heights. He was a hunter, But never quarry had he sought before, With quailing heart as now. He nothing found; Searching each crevice, plunging with wild eyes And eager hands, in every bush, and mounting At desperate risk to ledges half way up The rock's blank face, there was no shape to see Living or dead; no shred of stuff, no bough Broken or bent; no sign however small Of any passage of a mortal thing; Only, a long way off, a cloud of wings, Dark wings that faded as he looked, and told Of eyes that had been baffled as his own. And Eurien returned, and called to horse As many of his men as he could mount, And set them, for their part, to scour the plain. All through the night it was as if the stars Had left their wonted courses, and were seeking Our lost one on the mountains; so the torches Gleamed through the dark, to sicken with the dawn. Our Chieftain went not forth at peep of day To wreak his wrath on Cynorac, but came Faint with the fruitless search, his silken curls All heavy with night-dew, his garments sodden, And laid a clammy cheek on Modwyth's breast, And clasped her, frail and slender, in his arms, As if to stay her sorrow; but few words Were past betwixt the two; I think each felt And knew the other felt a weight that hung More dead about the heart than grief alone. So Eurien headed not the march on Cynorac Nor that day, nor the next; but plied his search And woke the region all about with question, But never came an answer back to him. Only he knew that none could fall and live From Cromlech heights, and all he strove to gain Was a sad wreck to hide beneath the sod. Then as the days went past there grew about her, And all the thought of her, the sacredness That rises from fresh graves; and lightest fancies That haply they had scorned awhile ago, Were as the daisies of her bed of death; While all that once had stirred her spirit's depths Was lighted by a sudden shaft of glory. So Eurien laid on Mona's unknown grave The vengeance he had thought to take on Cynorac. And I, GlÃ¢n-Alarch, live,âlive still to chant This song of death,âlive still, unlike the swan Who sings his troubled life away, and makes His fond farewell to pain! Oh, if mine heart Would bleed to death in song I would sing on; But as my life hath been the mock of Fate, So is my withered frame the scorn of Death; If I must bide for ever to be howled at By all the winds of heaven, I will howl No answer back, but bide for ever dumb. GlÃ¢n-Alarch now hath spoken his last word. BOOK II. Our silent house of Garth, whereon the winds And driving rains of autumn sadly beat, Gave back no answer to the wild appeal; What soul of us had voice or heart to chide That fleeces dropped from off rank sheep; that seed Slept idle in the granaries; that strength Of man and beast were lost in labouring Ground which had shut it in so close a grave, The angel of the spring had called in vain To resurrection. âLet him call,â I said Within my heart, benumbed with sullen pain; âLet the world rot, and its false promise sleep For aye, since sleep is good, though death is best!â So in the dumbness of the house we two, The elders, we on whom the stroke of grief Fell sorest, seeing for us no new quick rush Of life rolled back the stone from off the heart, Sate by the fire, our days as dull and pale As the wan embers whereupon we looked, And envied that their goal was reached so soon. And sitting thus it liked me well to hear The moaning of the wind, the wandering wind, Which might have brushed a secret in its course,â The happy wind that could not know or feel! If Modwyth heard it too, she heeded not; She met these empty days with idle hands, Save that they grasped her skirts, as set thereto By one who feared impediment to flight, And sate uneasily, with waiting face, Which spoke unto a heart which was the heart Still of GlÃ¢n-Alarch, answering to my look: âThere children twain await me; here but one.â So sorrow drew a circle round us two Whose spheres had never crossed in happier hours. Shriek clamorous winds and give our griefs a tongue, For he whose lips once overflowed with song As autumn combs with honey, now is grown The core of silence in this silent house. Rave wordless winds, obsequious to our woe, Break clouds, and blind the eyes of heaven with tears, For sad GlÃ¢n-Alarch will be heard no more; Yet would he, but for what is left in him Of manhood, lift his broken voice on high And cry you down with grief unsyllabled. Ay, break your rage, rough winds, upon these stones, For they are old, and ancient things most move The hate that curdles at the heart of life; Ravage these walls of pale wind-flowers that harbour And bloom within their chinks; no colour bless, Nor perfume bathe their bareness evermore! So in my heart I answered to the wind, Content that it should howl as with our woe; But when the birds, befooled by struggling gleams Of sunshine glinted through the rended clouds, Piped dubiously, as they foretasted spring, I shut them from mine ears, as summer friends Unmannerly, who chatter of our loss, And turned me from the fickle sun away That dared to smile on wintry nakedness. O my white hairs! O eyes that see too far The griefs that march on us through every pass, Armed companies to ring us round, and crush us Here in our mountain cage! O weak right arm That fain had lent to Eurien its strength; O song, that wast already as a voice Breaking, not richly to virility, But poorly to the pulpless infancy That waits on length of days;âthou, even thou; Sad song, art prisoner in the war of life, And never from thy dungeon may break forth, Nay, not to raise a standard of high hope, Or lift my chieftain's name above the wreck. But clearer than the bodings of the wind, More timeous than the piping of the birds, There came to us as there we sate and watched The smoke-wreaths curl, sounds of a mimic strife,â The tramp of marching feet, the clash of arms, And Eurien's voice uplifted in command, Coming to fill the gaps in home and heart With Eurien's shining image. I, GlÃ¢n-Alarch, Heard it, and thought the world which now seemed dead, Might haply be rekindled by the sparks Struck out from steel; and Modwyth heard it, with me, And loosed her skirts, content to bide the issue; Or, if she sorted silks, would ravel all In trembling haste, and leave them in her lap. Fair Bronwen heard it, and her ivory throat, Leaned sedulous above some household task, Would rear itself, which while her side-long glance Would seem to pierce like wind-blown hail, and reach The place where Eurien's levies daily learnt The grammar of the blood-red tongue of war. Then she would call her thoughts to heal, and pluck With gentle force from Modwyth's hand, the threads To disengage from knots, and lay them spread All fairly out beneath her heedless fingers. I think, in sooth, that life could show few knots The woman's nimble tact had not won through; But shears had served her turn where fingers failed. Oh in these days our wounds had stately tendance; For our still house, whose pulse might else have ceased, Or beat disorderly, was kept in time, And held in active function, in the grasp Of Bronwen's supple hand,âcontent to guide Her house of Havod and its impish heir With longer rein, or furtive visits stolen From sleep, or much-beholden hours of rest. And so it grew to be that all the place Was filled as with a whisper of her presence, Which chased the dust from distant corridors, Which set in motion idle feet and hands, And turned again the groaning wheels of life, Laying a web of comfort, and of healing Ev'n on the very gashes of our hearts. When Eurien's voice no longer from the vale Clove the dull air about our stagnant hearth, And Eurien's self undid the door, and cameâ His beauty dashed a little by the rain, With tumbled gold of beard, and hair, bespread Over the face the steely showers made pale,â I loved him that he showed so comfortless, And prized him dearer for his beauty's loss. But Bronwen's loveâif that she loved him tooâ Was humble at such times, and challenged not His notice, as with motion swift she gave The sign which brought a servile train to crown The board with ordered plenty; whereupon Would follow a wild troop of squires and pages, And shaggy men of various estate, Who shared the wrongs of Eurien and of Wales, And fattened them at Eurien's daily cost. Then Bronwen, like the spirit of good cheer,â But for a spirit all too busked and sleek,â Carved and apportioned with a dextrous choice The meats and winter fruits, the cakes and bread,â Some fine and honey-sweetened, some of rye That, soured with age, was still found sweet enough For palates not perplexed with dainty use. And Bronwen's face would shine on us, but most On Eurien, as shines the moon when gilt To be the lamp of such as house the harvest; But unto those wild men who pressed around, And drank deep draughts, and emptied mighty trenchers, Her looks were strange and cold; still like the moon, But like it on its darkened nether side. Oh days both sad and heavy !âweariest days Will pass, and these, if heavy, pass'd too soon! The honest sorrow of our hearts was changed Ere long for bastard peace. The eyes of Modwyth Would wander off from reading Eurien's face, To gaze on Bronwen's, and then back again, Till to and fro, her glance would seem to spin A web about, and bind the twain in one. Then the false winds forgot to moan, the vain Light heavens put back their tears, the sun looked out Cold, cold as justice, or as charity; The robin, like a wretch that sings for bread, Quavered harsh notes,âand all the world went mad. No no, it was not love that came to chase Grim sorrow from our hearts; had it been love, High love indeed, which had been born for Eurienâ Though sprung from out a grave too newly trenchedâ I should have owned its presence as a thing Divine,âthough somewhat rathe in its approach; If I had tasked it that it came too soon, I had not held it pestilent as now. But I, GlÃ¢n-Alarch, I have lived too long, The hours now pass me by with leaden feet, And the swift years reel after them, and seem To gain upon them in the race of time; The moments, long for grief, still bring short months, That come to aged hearts too soon for joy. There hath been feasting in the halls of Garth, Feasting and wassail, though the soul of mirth Seemed dead within our midst, or rapt away As liking not our company. The feast Had been of marriage; wildly shrilled the pipes, And like to froward tongues the cymbals clanged, Tearing the seemly silence from our woe, As one might strip the cerements from a corpse. Then when the shouting and the clangour failed For weariness, and we were set at even, In rank about the board, Bronwen looked round Sheer in my face,âfor there had come a gap Of the old silence, which her haughty eye Commanded me to fill. She was the queen And lady of us all, Bronwen the wise, Whose beauty was the theme of many a song; And more than all, she was a chosen bride Of Eurien, lord and owner of my heart; But still my pallid gaze gave back to hers Denial which she could not overbear. The silence lingered yet awhile, then broke, Broke of itself, and with a heavy crash As of a body fallen upon the hearth; When all the hall from floor to blackened rafters, Kindled with sudden fire, and there arose A note as if our scantly buried sorrow Had gotten loose, and found itself a voice Tuned to the pattern of the woeful wind. A shudder seemed to wind us all in one For one brief moment, as at ghostly bidding, Our souls rose up and wandering through the night, Left empty bodies in our seats, the while They shivered in the wind on Clogwyn Cromlech. Then Eurien turned, and showed the wolf-hound, Abred, Whom falling of a yule-log had awakened, Howling his weird defiance at the moon; Whereon our souls came back to us again. Our Chieftain hailed the wolf-dog to his place, And called on us to let the harp go round; But I leaned back, nor touched it with a breath; While Bronwen took it in her hands, and held A moment all familiarly, as one Who loving not a babe, still loves to twit it; Then striking, made it cry aloud, and laughed; It was her hour of triumph, when light ripples Dance lightly into waves; she looked my way Once more, and sweetly to our Chieftain said, Though bitterly to me: âIt seems, my lord, As if your house of Garth, where for you win This day a mistress, is not very tuneful, That it should lack a bard to laud the feat.â And Eurien, who had watched her with a smile, Sitting there crowned and radiant at his side, Fretting the harp, which seemed too slight a thing To thwart a soul so royally enhoused,â Stretched forth his sovereign hand to grip mine own; But answered nought, and spared to meet mine eye. But I spoke up: âThere have been harpers twain Here in this house of Garth, whom every breath Of Eurien stirred to music. One is dead,â Since when the other hath left off to sing.â Oh Eurien, you were gracious thus to suffer My heart to rise in judgment of your own; But Modwyth frowned, and Bronwen to her side Beckoned a henchman brought with her from Havod; One who was used to twang and thrum the harp In time for dancing; in good sooth the varlet Could boast a dexterous finger; in his hand She set it, all its triple chords perplexed With a jarred sigh; filled him a foaming flagon, And wreathing round his breast some woven flowers Snatched from the board, proclaimed him Bard of Garth. But Eurien stayed her here: âThy bard, sweet Bronwen, And Havod's; but for Garth, that post is filled, And in another sort;â then turned to Dafyth; âBard of the fairest lady in the land, A lighter lot is yours.â And so he took From off his neck a golden chain, and threw Over his lady's flowers, and smiled on her: âSweetheart, it seems that you have still to learn Whom you may bind with flowers, and whom with gold.â But Bronwen waited not on Eurien's words For following of the chain he cast away. Then Eurien again: âBeseech you, lady, Command your bard to strike some merry chord; For ours, he hath been, and he shall be ever, Free from all strain but music and his mood.â Then Dafyth seized the harp, and made its strings To caper till its fallen music seemed To habit in the heels of all our guests, Who loud upon the floor beat out the time. So as the mead past round, and voices rose, And Dafyth harped, with harpings emulous Against the rising babble,âharped and scared Shy music from the blatant strings,âI went Unnoted from the glowing hall, and stole Alone into the white, moon-lighted night, And stood beside the fall, where it had crashed A passage for itself through prisoning ice. Here, when the heart-deep roaring of the flood Had failed a moment, followed after me The voice of mirth and jingle of the harp, But tenderer grown with distance, till at last The cataracts loud wordless rage filled all The cavern of mine ear; and one by one The chambers in the turrets glimmered forth Like stars into the night. And then my soul Closed on itself the door, and knelt within A chamber yet more secret, seeing nought, And haply only soothed by the deep boom Of the vexed mountain torrent. So I prayed For Eurien's glory and for Eurien's peace, If peace and honour might consort together; For nuptial joys, and strength of joinÃ«d lives, And worthy issue, linking him with years To come, when he from off the earth should cease. And as I woke from prayer, I felt a warmth Bathing my hand; felt too, and heard a breath Taken with mighty pants, close at my side. The clouds had overlapped the moon, and all Was dun as death, but still I knew that thing Which pressed against my side was wakeful love. Then from the humid warmth I freed my hand, And raising, rested it with inside touch Upon the brow of Myneth, Mona's hound, That from the day when she had gone from Garth Had vanished as her body, none knew where. I think I cried a cry, as Myneth's breath And greeting were a moment on my face; But not a whimper of her joy made answer, And promptly at a signal far beneath The black brow of the hill, she, bounding off, Was swallowed in the silence of the night. And stumbling through the darkness, I made haste To look from off the hill where she went down, And thought one moment I discerned a lightâ Most like a wandering candle of the marsh;â And then I pressed my failing eyes, and looked Once more, and it was gone, and I was fain To doubt if I had seen, felt, greeted aught More solid than a vision which had come To soothe or mock the hunger of the heart. And so the marriage feast of Eurien past, While silence hung upon my lip like lead. That year the days grew long before their time; The sun shone late and early, and keen winds Drove home its beams through all the sodden fallows And marshy flats, and aired the drenchÃ«d world. And heads that had lain fallow with the fields Through the slow winter, now grew rife with thoughts Of husbandry, while others, lightlier bent, Woke at the beckoning of the beam and breeze To wandering fancies, straggling wild as weeds. So, wise or thriftless, they who were content In meagre winter months to take our cheer, Lodging and pottage, and to lend themselves As journeymen to learn the trade of war, Rose up together with the stir of spring, Bade us God speed, and left us to ourselves. Oh then the face of Bronwen at the board,â The lesser board whose viands were more choice And service daintier,âshone, a radiant sphere That kept no darkened half for outside souls. And sitting in the flickering light at eve, Filled full with work and cheer, and blown by winds As precious as the ransom of a king, Some of us haply nodded o'er the blaze, Our senses lapped by murmurous tongues of flame; But Eurien with his ice-blue eyes would gaze Undaunted on the embers' burning heart, Turning within his own, as well I knew, Deep thoughts whose hour of action was not yet. Then Bronwen's fingers, shedding of their work, Would twine themselves within, and unclasp Eurien's Close knotted as they were, and reach his palm With hers, as warm as the full-podded flax That ripens in the sun, and whisper him; That sweeter thoughts were his for close of day, Than plans for ploughing fields, or seeding furrows;â It was her art t' interpret thus his mind;â And then when she had won him from his mood, And got his softened eyes to speak her fair, Taking sweet rest, all languorously reclined, Bathed in the ruddy glow,âthe woman in her Was well content, exulting in her power. For honour and for peace, if they might grow Together on one tree of life, my prayer To God for Eurien; and the days which came Brought peace and plenty to our house of Garth, But honour, more than ever, was his meed At tilt and tourney where his lance was first,â In skirmish with our brawling chiefs, or such As daring hunter wins from his compeers,â Was yet to crown our chieftain's tawny locks. And I who loved him better than my life, Andâsooth to say itâbetter than his own, Grew jealous of the cheek that waxed too fair With body's health, and spirit's dull content; And ever when we two came face to face, I strove to prick his heart with memory Of Cymric wrong, and all that brood of sorrows Which, if it seemed to snatch a moment's rest, Would waken with a wilder throb ere long. And sometimes with that look which took all hearts, Eurien would turn on me, and bid me trust The tardy healing power of Cymric wounds; And sometimes he, without a word, would lay My hand upon his girdle, where that other Holding the leaden missile, pressed his heart; Anon would make complaint that men and times Were yet not ripe for action; at which word I would approve to him that souls heroic In this were demi-gods,âthat they could breathe Or shine on men and times, and ripen both. And then at whiles upon his lip and brow Would come that pallor of the refluent blood, And to his eyes that look of one who saw Fruit in the flower, and seed within the fruit, Which boded that his spirit had been summoned On high, to meet a council of his peers. Then I, who humbly loved him, sat and thought Rejoicingly, that he in his young wisdom And guarded strength, was greater far than I Who, in my unthrift impotence of age, Had fought a giant with unmeasured swords. The year fulfilled itself; the earth once more Was pregnant with the slowly-ripening grain. And Bronwen was the lady of the land; A fair, firm woman; one who ruled her house As Eurien his state; nay, ruled her house But ruled it in another sort than he, Who, like a god, gave back with rich increase His lieges' tribute and their fitful service; Shielding the weak, and lifting up the low, Pruning the insolence of pride, and storing Scant fruit for all his pain, to leave a harvest More generous for the gleaners of his fields. But not so Bronwen, who from day to day Waxed as the waxing moon in all that made The ordered sweep and circle of her life: More affluent in beauty and in honour, With hands more flush of power, and of means Of making by accretion; with an ocean Of duty it became her part to rule,â A sea with tides that shifted with the seasons, And runnels intersecting all the shores That bordered it. So waxed she in her place, And so her shadow broadened all around. As Bronwen, like the moon that fills her horn, Rounded to perfect shape, so Modwyth waned, Like the sad evening star that tends on her. But Modwyth's will had triumphed, and some hold That woman's will is woman's paradise. If such were hers, it was a fading portion; I, cowering o'er the hearth, Eurien a-field, Watched the frail fingers twisting threads of flax, Grow thin and whiter as the weeks rolled on, And weak, I thought, for lack of stronger work. But when the even of each day was come, When babes were hushed, and labour sought repose, The wheel of Modwyth by an empty chair Stood silent, while from hut to hut there passed A presence with a hand outstretched, that dropped Comfort as God drops flowers upon the fields; And for some sickness never to be cured, Or only by th' all-healing sleep of death, At whiles from Modwyth's faded lips flowed out Words, which were glowing with a light, that touched The rampant ill with glory, till it seemed To pierce the gloom which wraps all human thought, And shine an upraised banner of new hope. So plenty reigned at Garth; the kine increased, Fat beeves were in the stall, the milking pails Were foaming to the brim; lush fruits flowed in, Seed-pods yet green and tender, burst with fulness, And succulent roots, with crispÃ«d salad stems, And juicy leaves, and honey-dropping combs, Were heaped with fat flesh meats upon the board Crowned with tall tankards of new wine and mead. But for all hands that laboured once at Garth Mine own and Modwyth's were the only four Untasked to further effort; for the rest, Each tale of work was doubled, and each thrall Inept or idle, sent into the fields To tend the swine, or house and feed with them; Thus fewer mouths were matched with better fare. And now no longer like a running stream The largess of the house flowed out by day,â By day and eke by night for loud-tongued need; But times were set apart, when at the gate Bronwen stood up, fresh as a rain-washed rose, As ruddy, and deep-bosomed,âwith behind her The piled-up leavings of the house, in face, The pallid misery which sought relief;â The palsied age and puling infancy, The withered youth, and cankered morning prime, The pinched with want, or sore-disgraced of birth; And ever to mine eye the contrast grew More harsh;âthe lady Bronwen spread more fair, More dun and haggard showed the dwindling crowd. Then fences grew where no defence before Had ever been; the very mountain breeze, Fresh with the morning and the spring, and bearing Spice from the gorse, with odour of wild thyme And gums from opening buds, paused on the threshold, Nor blew the breath of nature through our lives. And ever as that plenteous house of Garth Grew fat but overflowed not, so the land Around it, held in tribute hands, grew lean. We of the household, who had used to take Our share of milk, now lapped the curded cream; So those without, who once from the same dish Had dipped with us, were fain to feed on whey. Oh fair and teeming world, world false as fair, Whose sweetest blossoms grow from out fresh graves, Rooting their callous virtues in dead hearts That once have loved them; oh thou falsest spring That ever breathed on shallow human hopes,â I, even I, GlÃ¢n-Alarch,âlusty grown As a blind capon fed for others' food,â I, even I rejoiced and hailed the sun; Strung daisies for the saucy imps who followed My errant steps; felt my faint heart spring up As fresh as watered-cresses of the brook; And one fair morn when all the world ran wild, When kids were frisking on the mountain's brow, And streams came leaping down its channelled sides, I could no longer close my heart to joy, But stood there laughing with the waterfall. Oh teeming earth, and spring unearthly fair! The beauty ye affect is but a mask; Pranked as ye are,âall green and lush with life,â Your painted semblance cries aloud of death, For she who loved,âwhom nature loved and feared,â Lies on her breast past any hope of spring; Unless she sleeps, and these more plenteous flowers, Are rosier tinted for her maiden dreams! No, she is dead, the world her tomb, whose fairness Has rapt her very memory from our hearts; For Bronwen moves among us quick with life, Shining with twofold lustre, since we see In her the sheaf, and beauteous continent Of a young hope for Eurien and for Glyneth. And I, even I, a wayward bard, and sullen, Jealous for love that perished ere its prime, And loth to love again where love hath been So deadly to my heart,âI, even I, Grew tender when I looked on her, the blessed, The chosen vessel, bearing Eurien's child. Then like the pregnant year, her beauty grew More changeful; there would come to her cold breaths From clouds, which broke in sudden tears; warm languors That none but Eurien might uphold! and fears Which he alone could quell. But of all sights That crossed her, none was grievous in her eyes As Poplet, with his antic ways, his tags Of borrowed wisdom, and his inborn cunning, Which often she chastised with cuffs, and rated With clamour, that unsettled all the house. So seeing that the wife this while in Bronwen Had overborne the mother in her heart, Our lordly chief consigned her forward son For page's training to a neighbour roof. And oftentimes when Eurien, returning At even, sate with her a space withdrawn, Bronwen would weep, and say his love was cold, For Cynorac, her foe e'en more than his,â He who had heaped unnumbered shames upon her,â Prospered and triumphed in impunity. And he who first was tender to her mood, Seeking to smooth her grief with gentle counsel, Thereafter lightlier put her plaint aside, Saying: âWe prosper, let him prosper too;â Or adding: âLet live all who live for Britain.â Then when she fretted the resisting chord, Remorse would ofttime wake a dormant echo, And Eurien's eyes, that turned towards Clogwyn Cromlech Through Bronwen's comely substance, would behold Things other than they looked on; at these seasons, His words were few, and like his gaze would seem As bent on distant journey. He would say: âI swore that day as now again I swear, To know no wrongs but those of Wales,ââWild Walesâ!â And sighing forth âWild Walesâ in solemn echo Of a dead voice, there past into his own A note of music strange to it before. This while more often than in days gone by Newsmongering guests would come to share our cheer, And often even at the mid-day meal Make light the ponderous meats with laugh and song. And I, grown loyal as I said, to her Who was the lady of my lord, and wearing In heaviness the burthen of his joy, Seemed to my love confounded with himself,â Rejoiced to see her gay, and even bore The recreant mirth of Dafyth's misused harp. But oftener than all others, when our lord Who doubted him, was on some distant quest, Weroc would come, and, ere he went his gate, Stand whispering by the lady, under cover Of Dafyth's jingling strings, which then would shriek The louder, while we others gazed aloof, Silent, as feeling treason in the air. For at such moments,âEurien far away,â It seemed to us that Eurien's unborn child Should be potential there to keep at bay Any whom Eurien's presence had abashed. And Weroc had been with us on a day Craftily chosen; but few words as yet Had past between them, and the talk that filled The vacant hour when all were met in hall Was hollow as a reed, the while a meaning Outside of it was borne in covert glances Betwixt our lady and her down-faced squire. I left the board ere yet the broth was cold; My wrath had spoken else; whereon the lady With lowered voice: âHe was sole bard of Garth Ere Dafyth came, and liketh not to hear Another harping better in his place.â I went out sad as angry, that our house,â Tuneful in happier days, as summer woods,â Had come to be the meeting place of daws. But Weroc when he went this day, had honour More than his wont, for Bronwen's own white hands Poured out a stirrup-cup, and bore to him Without the door, and waited there caressing His horse the while he drank, and waited still A while, when having done, he stooped above her To empty in her ear a parting word. Then Weroc took his way, and Bronwen hers, Crossing the court full stately, with a firm And rhythmic tread, to which her two hands beat The time, like cymbals clanged triumphantly. And I who had for Eurien's honour prayed, And Eurien's peace, if peace might dwell with honour, Had at the first been fain to be content With peace and plenty; what if at the last, Plenty should reign at Garth, and reign alone? That night brought Eurien home, with him a train, Longer than that wherewith a week agone He left, to offer fealty to the king Of the rich lands which border on the Severn. The newly crowned one was the only son Of Teudric,âhe who quitted throne and state, And fair renown untarnished by defeat, To live a hermit's life of prayer, and fasting, In honour of the only Son of God. And Bronwen, joyous at her lord's return, The leader of so brave a following, Had drest her house, and made herself as brave To greet them; and there came a genial hour Wherein the sports and jousts, by Mowric held, Were played or fought anew, and we who listened Made glad at heart to hear how Eurien ever Had held that place in both to him belonging. But Eurien careless of this wind blown praise, As feeling that some seeds of deeper purpose Bided within him but the turn of time To show a worthier harvest, put aside The theme, and asked his lady how the days Had sped with her at Garth, her lord away. Then Bronwen dropped her words into the pause Which waited them, and said in ear of all The silent household and the listening guests: âMy lord, I have been comforted to hear From noble lips, of honour you have won Abroad, for by my troth of loyal lady And loving wife,âalbeit I blush to own it,â You have been very foully shamed at home!â Then silence deepened in the hall, unbroken By Eurien even so much as by a word; But there was burning question in his eyes, And wrath concentred in the gathered limbs So late relaxed in careless rest; and Bronwen Went on as at his bidding, but her voice Shook as she louder spoke to steady it. âWe have been shamed, my lord, by Cynorac, Who mocks at you for leaving of his trespass So long unpunished. In the days gone by He was content to rob your mother's lands And mine, not then your wife, as now, but only Your love; he, having proved your tireless patience, Comes forward to a bolder tune, and beards you Not from afar, through others, but in face, As man to man. He chooses from your flocks,â Your household flocks, not those which roam at large, The one which most of all those flocks you cherish For the fine wool wherewith you count in time To profit our poor Glyneth;âtakes the beasts And judges them deliberately, selecting With a slow care the finest ram and ewe, And rides away with them in leash before him.â Then the clenched hand of Eurien lighted down, Amidst the platters on the oaken board, And touching with his ring a crystal goblet Laid it upon its base in glittering ruin. And warning off pale Bronwen as she rose To gather up the fragments, Eurien sate Grasping his crispÃ«d beard, his way in wrath,â Withdrawn within himself, silently shaping His purpose to the need of his displeasure. But counsel came to him, and suddenly He turned on Bronwen: âWho hath borne this tale?â And she who loved to tread in crooked paths, Yet seldom lied with lip, seemed forced to answer: âIt came from Weroc,âwrought before his eyes.â Then Eurien: âTell to Weroc when you next Have speech of him,âto Weroc, mischief-monger,â Spinner of spiders' webs that fail to stay Aught weightier than a gnat,âtell him I hold His Cynorac so modest to have taken One only pair of sheep from all my folds, I straight shall send him six, and therewith chide him That he accounted me so poor in grace As to have stinted for his open asking.â But Bronwen eyed her haughty lord askant, And thought his pride became him well; albeitâ Holding his words no better than a boastâ She looked for likelier fruit of Weroc's cunning. For Weroc was the thief who wore the cloak Of Cynorac, whereof if Bronwen wist, She held herself apart from open proof. Next day at dawn the stranger knights rode forth, And Eurien with them, through the fine, soft rain That gemmed his hair and beard with thick-sewn beads As diamonds golden-threaded; and he rode, Speaking with bended head and lowered voice To a grey knight of Mowric's, who was deep In Mowric's council; and the talk was all Of plots without and jealousies within, And plans to bind our Cymri in one bond Of brotherhood, to stem the tide of doom. And bidding them God-speed, as from the sun New-risen, shot a vague and watery gleam, Lighting a new-born hope, pale as the dawn, As sad and dubious, we two turned away, And wending slowly homeward, Eurien looked Round on the tearful land, wherefrom the mists Were rising, gathered up like filmy scarves In folds about the mountains' turbaned heads; And tenderly his voice that stirred my heart More than all other voices, being made I think to wake a hidden soul of music In wayside stones, gave forth a strain that bore A sadness to his mien and words unknown; He spoke in music only, and in music My heart responded truly, tone for tone; The burthen of his plaint was âWales, wild Wales!â And when his song was ended, Eurien turned not, But spoke his heart, faintly, as in a dream: âThink you in truth that he,âour great Pendragon,â Arthur, still lives in some high land of FaÃ«ry Whence he may win to us, and with that brand Men tell of, cleave the heart of Dynas-Emrys, And mount the golden chair which Merlin guards Within? What say you? will he once more gather Our scattered Cymri in his kingly hands, Bind them in one, and so compacted hurl themâ Hurl them against the Saxon that we back him, Ay, back until we choke him in the sea?â Then I GlÃ¢n-Alarch, wakening to his voice: âShould our heartsâ longing so prevail on his, That he for us will leave some further sphere,â He being of those ripe souls who have o'ercome,â Past nobly through the flesh,âbut who return For love of man, to run the course once more,â Causing the level of the race to rise By their sole presence as an inland sea By the unsealÃ«d heart of some high spring,â If such pure sacrifice, of God allowed, Be made by Arthur for his trampled Britons, One thing is sure: our hope will be revealed First in the forward ranks of marching men.â And Eurien whose passion seemed to glow And kindle into flame, although unfed By Saxon outrage later than the slaughter Of the twelve-hundred, struck his clenched right hand Hard on his girdle, where the leaden ball Lay, waiting to be launched; and as I looked I felt a traitor ever to have deemed It could beseem his cheek to show more pale. He paused; then answering to his thought, resumed: âThe life she bore, thrice over she had yielded, So death that frees the soul should let it blow The flame which kindled her in living fire Through Cymric souls, to weld them into one!â Then first I knew that she whose death had crowned My cup of sorrows, lived in Eurien's heart, Wherein mine own found comfort ever more, Though all unwitting of the sweet encounter. And eyeing him from 'neath my shaggy brows,â Him, Eurien the golden, on whose person The sunbeams loved to gather; he whose head Now rayed with broken light from lip and crown, Strong as a god's, was as a woman's fair, Whose limbs in nature's finest mould were fashioned, And cast in nature's most enduring metal, Whose very garments, chosen for their fitness, Became revealing, as the jewelled feathers Of some rare bird proclaim the daintiness Which rules its life,âI looked on him and sighed: âMy son, an unthrift hand hath wrought these titles Which have not won for thee the crown of love; Nay more, whose very splendour was the blind Which made you lose in youth the way of life.â And musing thus, I thought how Eurien's youth Was poorer than mine age; that golden Eurien Might never hear the tale which now I heard Blown by the trumpet of the honeysuckle Across the vale of years,âblown strong and sweet, Opening the long-closed, silent ways of life,â Awakening dead regrets, and living hope. So on we rode in silence, while the birds Sung of the brightening promise of the day, And shook the pendant drops from verdant eaves Which sloped above their nests. Then, when the valley Widened, and laid its townships, hamlets, castles, At Eurien's feet, he spake again; and thus: âWe Cymri are as sheep that have no shepherd; Mowric is leal, but as a wind-blown flame;â A king of Glyneth, but no king of men. What man if he should lift him to our head, Could draw the scattered flock to follow him?â I answered hotly: âEurien is the man.â He turned on me as never until now In sudden wrath: âThese be no words of wisdom Worthy the sanction of a hoary crown; 'Tis Eurien you speak with,ânot Brocmail! Shall I as he, pricked by a vain ambition, Open a way to Britain's bleeding heart, Heedless of warning, anguish, ruth, and shame?â And then more gently, having gathered patience With age that was more rash than others' youth. âThe chief of Snowdon owns a noble name, And nobler that it hath been wisely borne; But âSnowdonâ is no cry of leadership That to the few bold bands we seek to train, Could rally such a following as would quell Long rooted hate, and smooth divided council. Other than I must be the man whose head Is consecrate to so supreme a task. The sheen of youth, its boasts of strength and prowess, Its craving need to be, and to possess, Its hopes too high, its time too long to weave And wear them in, are arguments wherefrom Our jealous chiefs would gather harsh conclusions. One now to lead our Cymri should be hoar As wise with age; should be as God who gives, Not man who grips. Grey Teudric, with his crown Of power and meekness, had been he, if only His heart when dead to self, had lived for Britain. It was not so, and vengeance still must ripen. Our way is dark, we know not where it leads us, The road still narrows, while its side-paths close; Hold the heart high, and keep the spirit pure, Then, watchful and alert, come what come may, We in the teeth of Fate shall still be men,â E'en in the jaws of Fate as men would fall! But, my GlÃ¢n-Alarch, side not with the fiend Who tempts me, and would tempt me with more power But for a voice whose silence weights my thoughts, And a lost presence mingled with my life.â Then answerless, rebuked, with downcast looks I rode by Eurien; but my heart beat high; For truly as I think the proudest thing That rears its head on earth, is love, and mine For Eurien now was rampant in content. Then silence fell again, until the towers Of Garth rose up; when Eurien to me: âOur hands, GlÃ¢n-Alarch, now are somewhat bare Of fitting work; our levies broken loose, Like water that the breath of spring unlocks, Are spread abroad upon those summer fields Their sweat makes fruitful; so these summer days That had been short for work, are long for waiting.â âAy, they are long,â I said, âbut there is still The chase to keep the soldier's veins in health, To exercise his arm, and teach him cunning.â âThat game,â quoth he, âI fear that we have played With passion too prolonged; my hoped-for heir, If we should keep this merry fashion going As we have kept it, scarce would know the joy Of saving his white fleshâit should be white, His mother's isâfrom the still whiter fangs The hungry wolf uncovers. We must leave Some pickings from the feast of life for those Who seat them at the board when we have done.â I smiled that he was gay; I wished him troubled At whiles when he was still, yet when his brow Was dark, I seemed to lose my way of life. I laughed: âWe'll leave the lean and wiry wolf To teach young Eurien, that is to be, Our long endurance, when the brutish men That were our masters shall be trodden under. We who have learnt our lesson of the wolf,â Learnt it too well as she you wot of told usâ We need not scorn to drink enlivening draughts Of the sweet air in questing humbler game. The bear would not more savagely defend His hold than we these mountains from the hunters Who hem us in; and now methinks we might With profit learn some cunning of the creatures Who make their wiles atone for lack of strength, And in the padded steps e'en of the hare,â Whose ears are funnels of all dangerous sound,â Take counsel of her shifts, her craft, her doubles; And, as all means are good that are well used, Find in her oily course an argument Wherewith to whet the temper of our spirit. The rather would I that you should decline Upon this lowlier sport, first, that you hold Your life in fee for Cambria, secondly, That herein old GlÃ¢n-Alarch, your dumb bard, May still be partner with you.â Eurien spoke not; His looks were set high o'er Y-Aran's summit, Piercing the cloud beyond it; then he turned And flashed on me, and all his soul I saw Was stirred within him, as it came to meet And hail me at the threshold of his eyes, Ere yet mine own was waked with sudden clangour Reverberate to the metal of his voice. âNow by my knighthood, and my hope of heaven, No hare that hath her form on any hill Or plain, or valley where my rule is known, Shall ever flee me more, by me pursued!â Then hurriedly: âA week agone we met,â You were not of usâmet upon the banks Of Llyn-y-Gader; on the dewy ground The scent was hot. Our game was promptly found, And from the brake, the hare fled full in view, And straightened from the first, as though she knew Her race that day would be a race with death. So past we on through unaccustomed glens, And over mountain spurs, still calling up Old echoes that had slept the summer long. A robe of state had covered all the pack, And still in view of men, and flying hounds, And staring horses, sped the gallant hare,â The fleeting fixture of a hundred eyes. Her tale had had another end, I trow; She would have perished at Lake Quellen's side, If from the flanks of Moel-Ruth had come No flock of mountain sheep to cross our path, And let her glide unnoted in the rout Into a bowery copse we left behind us. Then it was good to see the baffled hounds âCastâ themselves, sprinkled singly o'er the vale, As a full shower of grain that leaves the hand Of a skilled sower; and ere long the tongue Of Chorister, that ne'er was known to lie, Broke the still air, and every head was turned, Retracing that same way by which we came. So on past Llyn-y-Gader, in one burst To where the Colwyn and blue waters meet, Leaving Y-Aran, on past Dynas-Emrys To Llyn-y-dinas, where the burning scent Was quenched upon the water's edge. And here I thought no wrong to help the eager brutes, So wound my horn, and âliftedâ them to where My human cunning told me that the game Had landed. Then we hit the line again, And all the narrowing vale was overflowed With music which the mountain sides beat back,â With music welling up from clarion throats, Bursting as living springs of harmony, Whose waves repelled, crossed clamorously, and made An inland sea of turbulent sound, which maddened The sense of all who heard it. âOn we flew, A lessening train, to right of Gwynant Lyn, Over the bryn, past Hafod,âholm, and mere,â On and still on, with neither halt nor check, At blinding pace, meeting the treacherous wind Which blew the secret of the hapless hare Full in the faces of the pack; so on Towards Pen-y-Gwryd, a still dwindling train Of horsemen; only I and Wythan now To take brook Teryn, and to find when landed Upon its further side, the hounds at fault, Scouring the widening valley, snuffing wildly At tainted stems and herbage; whimpering Of baffled rage. âThen, then GlÃ¢n-Alarch mine, I was no better than a beast myself; The brute had broken loose in me, the lust Of conquest grew with struggle; the frail thing We huntedâcrept for shelter 'neath a stone That shelved above the brookâhad from that covert, Gathered within her timorous ear, the sharp, Wild hue and cry of dogs and men, and trampling Of steeds that plunged above her heavily, Leaving her panting for the life scarce saved. âSo round and round we flew, we, baffled beasts, The dogs and I alone; for Wythan's horse Grown wild, had made a stride too rash in leaping The brook, and suffered hurt; then stealing forth With gathered courage, I beheld the hare Skimming the ground, unweaving for her part Our desperate morning's work,âspinning her way Backward through Gwynant vale. I blew my horn; The maddened hounds pressed round me, fierce, redeyed, With flapping tongues that hung like bloody banners, And at my voice and gesture, flung themselves Once more across the brook, and back we flew, The savage pack in front, and I alone Of all their morning's following, behind; The valley full of discord, re-awakened,â Their yelling tongues, and mine that cheered them on. âGlÃ¢n-Alarch! From the side of Gant-y-Wennol, Letting itself fall slowly, as a giant Folding his arms round peaks and crags, might drop From off a mountain's brow, there came a cloud,â A tall, white cloud, which spread itself in mist, Over the path we followed through the vale. âWe gained upon the hare; again she broke In sight of our pursuing eyes; we gained, She lost with every stride; then in our path She lay down spent; she yielded, poor dumb wretch, But yielded to fierce foes who gave no quarter. A moment, but a little moment more, And she had perished, torn by ravening hounds, Nor lived to ransom all her kind of me. But lo, within the mist whereof we neared The skirts, there stood revealÃ«d now to view A maiden, draped, and veiled in spotless white,â A maid of stature tall, and vast of limb, Beyond the wont of mortals; and she seemed Of the white mist to be the whiter core. âAh then, GlÃ¢n-Alarch mine, a weird, a wonder, Grew up before my eyes; this stately virgin, This maiden of the mist, spread her fair arms, And into them, half dead, our victim sprung,â Sprung with an impulse of expiring nature,â And panting on a heart that seemed the home Of all the charities, closed her faint eyes, And drooped her head in sweet abandonment, And utter joy of safety, and of rest. âThen the fierce pack that would not be denied, Swept after her, and clove the silvery mist,â A serried body, reeking bloody hate,â And would I think have snatched the creature forth, E'en from the haven of those nursing arms. But lo, another wonder. At the foot Of that strange presence white and cold, they fell,â The savage yelping beasts with fiery eyes,â They fell,âtheir tongues subdued to tremulous sounds, Tamed in a moment, as by some great joy,â Fell whimpering, abject, licking her pale feet, And, fawning in the dust, they lay there grovelling As they would bore their graves, and hide them in it. âI saw no more; shame blinded me. I fell, I too, upon my knees, and could have buried My shamÃ«d manhood in the dust with them. When next I looked, the mist had grown a cloud More dense and white than at its first descent From Wennoll, and from forth of it, the hounds Trailed themselves one by one, and dropped about me Resting on trembling haunches, while they met My glance with such confused and conscious looks As suit conspirers in some deed of ill. âBut now the greatest wonder, and the last. The cloud moved slowly on towards Gwynant lake, Then spread itself abroad again in mist, And not the faintest film of human form Remained within it;âmaid, and hare were gone. GlÃ¢n-Alarch, I am not as thou, a seer, So have not learnt to doubt the tale mine eyes May tell, or hold it over-true to be The common showing of a world of shows. That which my sense has pictured, I have taken As the true message of a trusted servant, No more;âbut this, what shall I say of this? Believe me I had counted it a dream If its beginning had not had firm proof;â For look youââ Eurien's voice grew faint with awe And breathed its burthen closer in my ear,â âThat maiden of the mist, that high white spirit Which for a moment to my spirit became As palpable, was Mona! By her arm, Waving its queenly bidding to the hounds, I knew her, as they knew her; oh, GlÃ¢n-Alarch, Her love was great, it will not have me shame it, Her love was high, and will not let me fall, I too GlÃ¢n-Alarch, I arose that day From out the dust where I had fallen, and left My baser part in it; with sterner sense Of manhood in me, then I swore to give My undivided strength, to âWales, wild Wales!ââ âWales, Wales, wild Wales, and Eurien for Wales!â I echoed, and the breeze that brushed my beard Prolonged the cry, and all the air seemed stirring With voices as a chorus swelling it. Then âWales, wild Wales, and Eurien but for Wales!â He answered me; and we two side by side Rode in white heat of passion, pale as wraiths. The harvest time was come again, and seed Sown in a tearful spring, was reaped in joy Of autumn sunshine broadening on full fields. And when the sickle eased the groaning earth, And the fair fruit of all its toil, was laid In sheaves upon its breast, then Bronwen held Within her arms a separate life, and paused A moment from her own, to dwell with it On the still border-land of infancy, In careless rest of innocence, and peace. And Eurien's eyes that looked upon his son,â Albeit in manhood's early prime, their light Was dimmed by shadows of the past, and doubts Veiling the threatening future,âfilled with joy Unreasoning as the love which gives it birth: Joy that a man is born into the world,â The bitter, weary, dubious world,âand love That still should quell, and still creates such joy. But joy and love were brooding in the silence Which wrapped the young child's life; and where love dwells There faith and hope, her sisters twain, will come And show themselves, if only in our dreams. Wherefore the child of Eurien, born to see The rise or fall of many Cymric hopes, The rise or fall may be of Cymric life, Was welcomed as an unblown flower of time, By hearts all reverent of its mystery. The silence passed; from out it came a stir, A glad new motion in our daily lives. Long-silent birds gushed forth in sudden song, As if in memory of their summer joys; The grey old towers and mouldering stones of Garth Grew warm in the embraces of the sun, And quickened with their warmth the Roman vines, Whose bunches overflowing, brought a gay Barbed throng to tap their wine to drowsy music. And louder than the drone of armed marauders Among the flushing vines of Garth-y-Gwin, More merry than the lated joy of birds, That sung the dying splendours of the woods, There rose from out the valley, sounds of labour Nearing its recompense; of men and maidsâ Their voices joined in laughter or in song Becauseânay, never seek a cause for joy! No flower that blows but somewhere had a root; Enough for simple hearts that Garth rejoiced For birth, the ripe, soon o'er-ripe year, for death. High festival was held again by Eurien In honour of the twofold joy; the harvest More fruitful than our fields for many a year Had yielded to our cares, and the young life Which showed yet fairer-fruited in our dreams. The banks of Colwyn, newly shorn, were gay With mounted knights and dames, bedecked like flowers; With banners floating on the breeze, and hauberk And lance that shone like dew-drops hung upon them. To one who watched them from the towers of Garth, These coming guests, backed by the tawny stubble, Were moving pictures, by a cunning hand, Set in a field of gold; and as they came, The broken music of the river rose And fell to other sounds than churlish glee, Or changes of grave words whereof the oxen Partook their share, and showed their equal sense. Anon the flourish of a horn would startle The echoes of our hills, and set them leaping As airy giants over rock and chasm; Or snatch of some gay song, or minstrel harp Would light the darkened passage of a wood, Or guide the eye to some untrodden path Betwixt the mountains, where the unseen guest Wound his wild way at Eurien's gracious bidding. And to this feast of baptism and of harvest, They who were summoned were of all degrees; Mowric was there, Glamorgan's silken chief, With many a thane, and many a belted knight, Wearers of torque and bracelet, squire and page; And therewith many a dame, in fairer field As potent as the lord who was her liege; These, and the followers of their high estate Had greeting as their worth; nor was there stint Of welcome for the men whose honest hands, Wearing no gloves of steel, were rough and horny,â Poor soldiers battling with brute elements, Whose daily conquests won no meed of praise. These ran and wrestled; haply lost and laughed, Giving their bodies up to merry scorn In feats impossible; or watched the great ones Who proved the keen delight of warlike contest, The keenest edge of danger dulled. The lists Were set within a long-disusÃ«d court; 'Twas Eurien's eye adjudged the space well levelled; His hand assigned their places to the judges; His spirit, fed in childhood by the tales Of that high table-land of honour, dear To men of Arthur's court, it was that kindled Us all, till at his fire we too took flame, And treading in those reverend steps, we felt Our office priestly to some sacred rite. No knight of Arthur's court, nay, not its headâ The âblameless kingââI speak it reverentlyâ For pure is pure and knows of no degree,â Could own a motive freer from all stain Of baser self, than that which urged our chief To gather thus the chivalry of Britain And forge in casual fellowship, firm links To bind its limbs as in one coat of mail. The prize our chieftain chose from out the treasures Which time had gathered in our house of Garth, Was one well made to shine in lady's eyes, And be the gage of beauty and of might. A chaplet all of orphrey, finely wrought, The work of Roman hand, with, in its midst, As mete to be the shield of some fair front, A dome of sapphires, dark as midnight sky, But lighted at its heart by one vast pearl, Resplendent as the moon which follows harvest. Men say the fatal beauty of this gem,â The fairest ever found in British waters,â Cost us our sovereignty, when, in a ring It pass'd as love-gage from a British maiden To one who bore it with him o'er the seas, And made with it his boast. Its modest light, Serene as virtue's self, meeting the eye Of him who was the tyrant then of Rome, Kindled the lust and greed that slept within it, And sent him from his palaces of pride To rifle for their pearls our sea-worn sands. This precious token then, of his great heart Our chieftain brought, and lifted up on high Where all might see the prize which skill and valour Might win for beauty. As the sapphires glowed Around the mild, white radiance of the pearl, The chaplet was the lure of every eye; Knights felt their courage rise, and dames their zest To watch the combat, quicken at the sight. Only one lady,âshe whose brow was crowned E'en as the Roman conqueror's,âbeheld it With eyes that had the greed importunate Of his. That one was Bronwen, whom all voices Had lifted to the throne, set in the midst For regal beauty. Looking on the chaplet Her lighter crown, grew light in her esteem, And in her breast a sullen sense of wrong Rose up, for that her having in this jewelâ A thing she felt her own by every title,â Should run the chances of a warlike game, Or mere caprice of knightly courtesy. On the one side our knights of Snowdon fought, Led by Garth's golden eagle, on the other The stranger knights with Mowric at their head. They strove all day, with ever-changing fortune, And at the end, when shrilling trumpets sounded And marshals of the court broke up the lists, The prize was still unwon. Then Bronwen felt It hard to wear her smiles, and keep her cheer, Yet only said in passing night to Eurien,â Said to her maidens with a silvered laugh Which just betrayed a steely edge: âDear ladies If we to-morrow would not see our knights Betray our cause as eke they have to-day, 'Twere best we bade them seek a ruder captain.â The taunt,âthe first that ever touched the sheen Of Eurien's honour, fell beside it harmless; He all unwitting of the poisoned sting, Even as a child that has no skill in danger Doubts not the coated venom of the wasp. The evening wore away, and half the night In song and revel; in all forms of feasting, And moods of mirth; but when the morrow came, The words were few, and they were feebly heard For clank of arms and hoofs, for champ of bits, And neigh of chargers, eager as their lords To prove their mettle. Pennons waved i' the wind, The lists were cleared, the judges set, the marshals And broidered heralds glowing in their places; The ladies shining with a softer radiance, All but one star who led the galaxy, Proud Bron wen, she who, girded in her robe Of gold and grain, that changed to dusky green, With shining bars of black that with each motion Of the fair shape within, broke into waves Which trembled on the beauty that they lapped,â Seemed to an eye whence years had filched the fire, A snake-like, burnished creature of the dust. Then Eurien raised again, high on the staff Within the ken of all, the costly prize As yet unwon; and laughing lips declared The pearl had grown in darkness of the night. They strove from morn till noon, as yesterday, While Fortune seemed to mock each side in turn,â Freakish as were the glimpses of the sun, Which shot at us betwixt the travelling clouds. An hour for baiting man and horse scarce taken At noon, the thunder of the charge set in, The lightning of the clashing steel flashed forth Anew. The bray of trumpets stirred the spirits, And knight and charger, hard to be restrained Stood trembling in the ranks on either side Waiting the signal. Eurien's eye was burning, His brow flushed, even to the shores whence set The wavelets of his yellow hair, his voice Cheering his knights of Snowdon when the thrust Of lance, or stroke of sword went fully home, Rung o'er the warlike din reverberate, And set his horse curvetting, flinging foam From the champed bit, from his red nostril smoke, And glare of baffled courage from his eye. For Eurien's hand that moved not, yet was closed So hard upon the reins, his glove of steel, Pressed deep into his flesh, the while he held His charger back, himself aloof from praise,â That meed too wildly coveted, which else Too lightly he had won, and paid too dear. I grew impatient then as Eurien's horse, Irate as Eurien's wife, when suddenly The chafing beast set free, rushed like a greyhound Loosed from the slips, and with his weight impetuous Staggered in mid career the heavy onslaught Of a grim knight, about to charge on Wythan, Ere yet his hands were freed, the overthrow Of a sworn freer. Our chieftain's fiery valour Made silence for a moment round the twain; Sparks flashed from targe and helm as though his strokes Were wrought upon an anvil; so he kept The knight at bay till Wythan claimed his own. Then from the watchful throng of stranger knights Rode one whose subtle tongue gained him the ear Of Mowric, one who knew full well the weight Of Eurien's thrust, but thought to tempt his stars This day which seemed propitious. In his eye There lurked such hatred as hard lessons leave In churlish minds. They met, and with the fortune IÃ¶lynâso men call himâshould have known. Our chieftain's hand, grown hot upon the work, And somewhat feverish from its long constraint, Splintered the braggart's lance in the first charge, And ere his seat was righted, struck the crest Sheer from his helm; which, falling to the ground, Was trodden by the horses as in scorn. At this there rose from out a group of pages The tinkle of light laughter, led by Poplet,â Here with his stranger lord,âand soon repressed, But urging first IÃ¶lyn's wrath to fury. Charge upon charge they met, our chieftain holding His own;â'twas hard for him to win and hold No more, and so angry were the eyes that glared From out the plated steel, so rude the hand Aiming to reach his face, which in fine scorn Of that he deemed too fair, he ever left Unguarded, e'en in deadliest heat of war. When Eurien bore his foe to earth unhorsed, He lighted down beside him, and the twain Fought hand to hand, which while the quickset hedge Of eyes that watched the lists grew fixed and fierce. Our chieftain's cunning hand prolonged the game, And dallied with his mad opponent, warding, Or dealing cut and thrust with such nice sense Of weight, as one well-skilled upon the harp Might use in playing it, yet from its strings Shake out the inmost tone that spared their life. But when at last the knight lay, back to earth, His vain heart panting heavily beneath The bended knee descending on its throbs, Then Eurien caught that baleful gleam of malice Hot from the eyes of Mowric's trusted servant, And swift as light, he loosed his hold, and leaving His sword within IÃ¶lyn's struggling hand, Sprung back, and fell before him, as if smitten With sudden blow or pang; whereon IÃ¶lyn Rose up astonished to astonished eyes, Waving a sword above a prostrate body,â A victor in the long unequal strife. My eyes were blind with rage, I only heard A shout go up to hail the victor's triumph,â That triumph which my chieftain's heart disdained, Or, not disdaining, threw away, as one Who trims his vessel for some mighty storm, May throw vain splendours to the howling waves Whereon dark Moel-Hebog answered back, As ever to all words proclaimed at Garth, And seemed to shake its sides with giant laughter. Then Eurien, he too rose, but faint and giddy, Striking his foot upon the earth, to feel After the ebbing strength which one dire moment Had overthrown; then went, a luckless knight,â He, golden Eurien,âon his way, and bent Lowly before the ladies with sad eyes, And parted silent lips, and came to Bronwen And whispered her: âWife, you as I, your knight, Will joy to lose some barren show of honour Laying it down in tribute to the cause We live for.â Then he stood beside her pale As lead, with on his brow the clustering curls Like draggled sheaves the hail had beaten down Dank, clinging in the sweat of that ere now Untasted anguish; but her gaze was set Above his head, hard on the pearl within The sapphire dome, which seemed to loom more large From further distance. Then with drooping glance She swept his pallid face, which forthwith reddened As if beneath a blow, and turned her own With all its smiles and favour, and the lightâ If light could live within her darkened eyesâ Full on IÃ¶lyn. Then my chieftain, you Who were to me as son, ay, son and father, Son, for you were the branch whereon my hopes Were sheathed, and father that I owed you more than life,â I could at this have seized my harp, and sung, And sung tempestuously your foregone praise, Breaking my vow of silence; but I laid Mine unsung song, as you your unwon crown, Low on that altar where our best was due. And other some there were whose eyes were used To glance from you, as birds of twilight spare To meet the sun in face, who unabashed Now eyed your brow unfilleted, though touched With such a grace as mocked the victor's crown, And would have made my words, though they had burst In passion's finest frenzy from my lips, No better than a goblet's empty ring. Some scorn there was, and some disdainful pity In that long gaze of Eurien which sounded The shallow soul with which his own was mated: The soul of that wise woman who knew glory Only by name, and would have looked askance At Jesu's crown of thorn,âaccounting it No better than a badge of common shame. There be some women, women woman-hearted, Whose hearts had died, slow withering, in the blight Of gaze so piteous, and of such proud pity; For her, she only reared her head, and raised Her hand to settle in its place, her poor Vain crown of beauty which had bowed to meet The helm of that false victor; and with smiles Still lingering when their duty had been done, Gazed loftily around in low content. Then Eurien put the bitter thoughts aside With the sweet mead in the untasted cup A hand had lifted to his saddle-bow, And threaded with his glance the moving crowd If haply he might find the fiery beard, The blood-charged eyes, straight brows, and mighty chest Crossed by the braceletted long arms of Cynorac. For he, too, had been bidden to the feast And tourney, by the hand which bore from Eurien His present of the ewes; he was not there, The friendly bidding seemingly was scorned, The hind detained;âbut that was yet to see. And knight still challenged knight, as the fierce game Raged on; but I had seen too much, and wearied To get above the din; so set my face And toiling steps to reach the mountain's brow. Grey towers of Garth-y-Gwin that showed so fair From thence! Old eyrie of our chieftain's race,â A race of eaglets who had seen the world Beneath their feet for ages, but had scorned To brush the dust or mire from off fat plains, And left them to the velvet clutch of owls. There looking down upon the plumes that flashed And whirled about us borne upon the wind, Seeing the streaming, blood-red flags, and housings Torn and bestrewing with their crimson shreds The ground from which the dust went up like smoke, Methought that ancient eyrie seemed to-day The scene of some dread battle of the birds. And from the dust, and through the rarer air, The sound of ringing hoofs, the heavy thud Of meeting bodies, and the clash of steel, With cries and shouts or groans of partisans, Came mingled with the bray of the big words By heralds trumpeted,âwhose meaning often The syllables that dropped upon the way Made mock of,âand got tangled in my thoughts With sports of other days, and dead bright eyes, And softened with the tuneful toil of bees At work to plenish Bronwen's winter stores With honey from the fading heather blooms, And guarded gorse, whose flower like human love Knows nought of seasons, or defies their rigour. Then suddenly above the droning bees And murmurous past, there rose a cheer wherein The youthful ring of Wythan's voice was clearest; So knew I that our gallant knights of Snowdon Had guarded well the treasure of our house, And that our pearl remained the pride of Garth. I hastened down the mountain; from our beeches The squirrels had been scared, but silently, Coming from time to time I saw not whence, To vanish like a guilty, furtive thing, There wheeled a bird with dusk, broad pinions spread, And burning eyes fixed keenly on the crowd Whose voices took a harsher edge, as thirst Was fired with deeper draughts. Alas, the bustards, And very carrion crows had come to know The bloody lapses of our Cymric sport. Yet still the horns went round, and still the laugh Grew wilder, when not quelled by deep-voiced oaths,â Retorts of charges fierce or querulous; Till Eurien, troubled at the rising tumult, Took from a page's hand a brimming beaker, And riding to the midst, he poured it forth On the hot stones wherefrom it rose in steam, And lifting clear above the muddy waves Of sound, the matchless music of his voice, He, singing as it were unto himself, Rid slowly through the court; the song he sung Was Bard Aneurin's song of Cateraeth,â That battle lost to Britons through the bees;â He sung, and silence grew about his steps, And the sad echoes whispered the refrain: âPale mead, that was their drink, became their poison!â Then many a fevered hand that late had vexed A charger's fretted mouth, or clutched a weapon In grip too deadly, closed in fellowship As sudden as its owner's foregone ire; And many an eye that had been stern with doubt Grew soft beneath a mist which seemed to rise As from the common tears of a doomed race. Ere long the lists were closed; the heralds sounded The signal that the busy day was done; And fluttering lawn, and silk of many dies, Enwoven in new waves of harmony, Past from the galleries, and left them bare Of beauty; while the mail-clad knights and squires Heavily lounging on their weary steeds, Besieged the issues of the court, in haste To be refreshed with change of suit, and rest. Then when the last armed tread that sought a place Within the castle walls, had died away, And waiting varlets leading to their stalls The slow paced chargers, left the court to silence, There rose through the thin air, and rose so high It might have been a message for the moon, The hymn that told how in the granaries Of Garth, the harvest of the year was housed. And suddenly the castle grew alive With faces ruddy in the evening light, Brightening each outlet, and with hands that waved Kerchiefs at loop and lancet, and with lungs That helped the note of triumph; then the voices Died out, and silence to my sense became As audible in the air that was a-quiver With chirp of crickets in the tawny grass, Or steadied for a moment by a gush Of greeting from some late-returning bird, Or cooled and sweetened with the plash of water, Or babble of young voices 'neath the beeches, That, in the overflowing of our halls, Became the tiring-room of page and squire. Bright over all the quaint shows of the feast Had slanted, when the guests were marshalled first, The low red sun, whose fiery oriflamme,â Like a false herald setting gules on gules,â Struck upon Ruval's beard, which thus beset, Gave back so bold a challenge to the eye, That Eurien rising up in joyful welcome, Had half let fall the name of âCynorac!â Ere Ruval's friendly glance spoke him denial. And they on whom the parting sun had shone Sate on when shadows deepened on the daÃ¯s, And knights and dames grew pale betwixt two lights, While the spent beams still brushed familiarly, As with a farewell token, the flushed cheek Of harvestman or maid; and still sate on, Laughing a little lower it may be, And drinking somewhat deeper, when the sad Last ashen pallor told the death of day. Then argent beams from the triumphant moon Prevailed through door and oriel, and were met By fitful glare of torches; and they sate, Sate still and feasted, sate and laughed and sung, And sung and quaffed, and wore the night away. When my wreathed harp at Eurien's later bidding Was brought to me, I took it tenderly, And held awhile ere passing it to Wythan; Yet as it left my grasp, a sigh broke forth Responsive to a touch, and all my being Was shaken as a lover's, who expecting No boon of love, unwittingly has come In casual contact with his lady's hand. Then the youth took my harp and woke its chords What while I listened, trembling and half wroth That this mine harp should answer any call But that which left it still to silent shame. He touched it softly, and it liked me well To hear how mournful a return it made; And then he sang, a song of little mirth, For which his tuneful voice won willing hearing. I spur all day from dawn till dark, I follow a phantom pale, And often I outrise the lark, Out-watch the nightingale; But whether I lie by a cool sweet spring, Or ride on a burning quest, A voice in mine ear still murmuring, Forbears me of my rest. She haunts the sunshine, haunts the shade, The mountain, and the stream, And I know not whether she be a maid, Or only a young man's dream; But my soul grows white in her lovely light, And my life so richly blest,â God wot if it better becomes a knight To possess or be possest. A silence fell, the while from hand to hand My harp was past, still past, abiding nowhere, Till Ruval seized it in a grasp familiar, And rose and smiled a truce to knights and dames, The temper of whose mirth had met rebuff; Then set his face to where the harvest folkâ Sunk in the silence of their grave repletion,â Bent open-eyed and eared, haply to pick From lordly droppings crumbs of lighter cheer. A timelier song than Wythan's, Ruval's woke A heartier echo; one of unknown love Had sung in unknown tongue; the other told A tale of cut and thrust, and wisely spake In harvest-time of harvest. This his lay. The table of the earth was spread, Her sheaves were all a-glow, The sun was laughing overhead, The reapers wrought below; All of a row those reapers ten Had stood since dewy morn, And bowed the head, ten brawny men, Above the bended corn. The table of the earth was spread, And jocund was the feast, For man there was good store of bread, Of fodder for the beast; At noon those merry reapers ten Past round the foaming horn, And laughed and quaffed, brown bearded men, Among the bearded corn. The table of the earth is spread, The corn-crake gleans the floor, The lark falls silent as the dead, The laugh rings out no more; And side by side those reapers ten, Upon the field new-shorn, Fall drowned in sleep, ten drowsy men, Like poppies in the corn. The mountain herds have ceased to graze, Still fall the forest leaves, But sudden motion bends and sways A dozen golden sheaves; And forth there step twelve armÃ«d men, Of Saxon mothers born; Now God protect those reapers ten Asleep among the corn. The murderous Sassenachs they creep,â Start, turn in craven fear! A faithful dog but gives to sleep One eye, and half an ear; Black Mervyn wakes those reapers ten; They rise with strength new-born, They rise and thresh those Saxon men Before they reap their corn. Some voices from the topmost table caught The tag, and sent it floating down the hall, When tributary echoes hurried in And made a roystering chorus. When it ceased, Voices of speech, not song, rose at the door; One voice in hoarse complaint of barred admittance, Striving and beaten back by the harsh tones Of Rhun, our warder, grating as his keys, And by the shrill and chirping insolence Of pages, prodigal of borrowed power. Then Eurien, whose glance had turned as often As any shadow played about the portal, Rose up, and stood with eager face attentive, Flushed with a generous hope, and looking welcome. I rose with Eurien, sharing Eurien's hope; My portion died that moment it was born; The lady Bronwen, seated by our chief, And toying with her bracelet, looked athwart him, Threading through interposing shapes of men And chattels, till her gaze which was as fine As sharpest needle-point, had seemed to prick The wolfish hide of Weroc; for he turned And met it; whereupon a sudden spark Flashed from the contact, as when steel meets flint. Then knew I that nor peace nor truce with Cynorac Would come to crown our festival this day. Our chieftain, in whose breast the hope had died Less violently, raised his voice, and quelled The tumult; then, with favour of his guests, Forbade that any having claim on him,â Seeking for council or redress from wrong,â Should, feast or fast-day, be denied his face. So from the open door the underlings Fell back, and straight from out the silver night The moonbeams seemed to swim into the hall, Borne on the stooping shoulders of a hind, And caught upon the fleecy carcases Of two fair mountain sheep with blood besprinkled, Slaughtered by hands unskilled, tied by their tails, And rudely spiked upon an up-turned harrow, Whereto the bearer of our chieftain's gift To Cynorac, like a beast of draught, was yoked. A silence fell upon our feast; the guests Both high and low, the haughty, loud, or dull, Where hushed in sudden brotherhood of shame. Wythan and Ruval, Caradoc and Gryffyth, Sprung to their feet; we Cymri, we are quick, Ay, quick to know and feel, and rash to act; A word or look from Eurien had sent them Panting o'er narrow mountain paths, with swords Drawn ready for the thrust which should have found Their sheaths ere dawn in Cynorac's churlish heart. But Eurien on whose brow one while had glowed A spot as if a burn had left its wheal, Now showed a face grown cold, and stern, and white,â Oh, whiter than the moonlight which it seemed Had clomb to reach it as its highest mark,â Eurien stood still, and gave no sign for action, Nay, seemed to tame their choler with his hand The while he struggled with his own, or took Counsel with knighthood how it best might strike. Then we who knew our chieftain's wont in wrath, How quick to break its bounds, and to run over,â As might a three parts plenished cup,âin foam, Saw in this sullen continence of ire, This stedfastness of muscle and of mien, This wary handling of the draught full-charged, The token of its deadlier quality. And I, who knew that poison had been dropped Into his wholesome blood by one whose part Had been yet more to sweeten it, had nought To urge but words which would have murdered peace And so I swallowed them with silent curses. And Bronwen, ever plucking at her bracelet, Sent furtive glances out to glean the news, Now here, now there about the hall, which keeping Below the mark of Eurien's eyes, one moment Encountered mine; whereon with a slow smile, Secure in insolence of conquering cunning, She sent them back their challenge. All this while The groaning shepherd, who had dragged his burthen To Eurien's feet, and fallen prone before him, Like an o'erladen beast, was lifting up His voice in lamentation of his hurts, His bruises, weariness, and stripes withal. And Eurien then, in whom the tide of life Began again to flow in wonted channels, Took from the board a weighty silver goblet, And filled it to the brim with generous wine, Then gave it to the hind, and bade him quell His overflowing sighs and words therewith. Then Eurien: âWe as yet but guess this riddle, Which savours of the mood of Cynorac; If he hath pointed his blunt wit with words, Or sent a key to help our own, speak out; Spare us the need to give it edge, or force it!â So urged the varlet spoke, and truly spoke All he might truly know; told how he came, Bearer of Eurien's present of the sheep, And Eurien's words of open heart, and told How Cynorac had scoffed at both, but most At Eurien's friendly bidding to the feast. Then proud to think his tongue had found the way To ears be-dulled for him by golden torques, The fool spun o'er and o'er, and round and round The taunting words of Cynorac; mumbling still: ââI marvel not,ââhis very words my liegeâ Lord Eurien seeks to have me eat his salt; Your salt when eaten by a lusty foe Is a rare physic for an ailing liver.â âAn ailing liver,â quotha; sooth, my lord, I mind his words, for there is rank offence In such for one who hath the wit to take it. And then he fell a-foul o' the poor sheep, Saying he had no mind to them, and swearing That else he had been bold to help himself, And waited no man's bidding; then he up And slew themânot in such wise as becomes A man to slaughter beasts, but vengefully, Vilely, as if the creatures had been men. Which done he bad his people dig a trench And haul them in; and, quotha, with a laugh, âGo tell your lord his beasts had Christian burial!â But ere his knaves had settled to their work, He changed his mind, and where I trembling stood, Commanded they should seize and harness me, Yoking me to the harrow and these twain As one might tie a clout behind a dog; And then the gang with curses and with blows Set on to drive me up the pass, and Cynorac Before I started shouted: âTell your lord To cook his sheep and serve them at his feast; I'll warrant them the tenderer for their trip. And haply,â quotha, âhe will send thee back, So full of gentleness he late hath grown, With thanks that I have made myself his butcher!â So with fierce laughter, and still fiercer cudgels Behind me, over hill and dale I come, And fall a bag of bruises at your foot With scarce the breath to bear his scurvy message.â This while, like horses scenting from afar The battle, our bold knights and squires, were fretting And chafing in their places, barely held By courtesy from rising in a troop; And many a muttered oath and wrathful gesture Had broken on this speech. But one there was Who, bending to the tale an ear attent, Smiled as a âMakerâ smiles, hearing his ode Rehearsed to chosen audience; it was Weroc, Whose damnÃ«d leer betrayed the artist's joy! Then Eurien, who now held his mood in hand, And tamed it with some pride in its subjection, Commanded that the hind should straight be freed, Set on his feet, have all meet tendance given To his complaints; and when he rendered back The cup, our chieftain filled it yet again, And bade him bear it with him as his pay; âSell it for salve,â he said, âto heal thy sores.â Which done he prayed the pardon of his guests That note so rude had come to mar their music; Bidding fair ladies call the flying colours Back to their cheeks, and not betray the cause Of joy and peace whereto they all had met. And then he ordered forth the deep blue HÃ®rlas, And bending low to Mowric, drained the whole; Then sent it on its course a-down the board, And turned to Bronwen, laughing, rallying her, That she, his wife, a mountain chieftain's dame, Who should ere this be free of their wild hills, And all the sudden changes of their skies, Should own her spirits dashed because, forsooth, The summery breath sent forth by him, returned In the rough hail of a tempestuous joke. Then Bronwen looked a moment in his face, And triumph deepened on her own, as smiling She strove with him to set once more adrift The stagnant talk, and call back vanished mirth To ring its merry changes in their words. So singly, cautiously, as huts are seen To rise upon a mountain's blackened side, Which fire, that may return ere long, hath swept Bare of all life, came at our chief's command, The word, the laugh, the jest, but empty all,â Mere habitations of our scattered spirits. Our chieftain in a voice that had too much The ring of steel in every note of it, Called on his guests to drink and sing; they drank, But song was scared; they drank, but did not sing. Then at a sign from Bronwen, Dafyth's harp Leapt with a shriek as of a mountebank That tumbles at a fair, into our midst; And all the jarring elements at strife Within the hall,âthe smouldering rage pent up, The smiling treachery, the hollow mirth, The tongue-tied honesty, the baffled hope, Seemed to commingle in a hurricane Of ribald sound, wherein at last the note Of a base triumph, a lewd merriment, Wanton, exultant, dominated all. Well for the varlet that his throat was hoarse, His mind as barren of all thought, but greed, And sympathy with cunning, as the owl's; Had his low triumph taken voice in words, There haply had been found a hand to turn A key upon them; tho' the lock were death. But peace; the tongues were loosed again, the voices, In high dispute with Dafyth's demon harp, Rose as it rose, commingling in the strife, And shapes of knights and ladies on the daÃ¯sâ Swayed to and fro with running talkâwere glowing With ruddy fire of torches, while the beams Of the white moon surged up to them, and made Our hall, which was the battle-plain of thoughts And sounds discordant, to my vision seem, The meeting-place of light from heaven and hell. Then straight on me, GlÃ¢n-Alarch, came the mood Wherein God's secrets open to my spirit; Wherein I see within, beyond mine eyes; Wherein the cries of meeting matter leave My ears impervious, while the immanent life Which burgeons in the buds of spring, which rises And swells within the wheat, which bursts in blessing From ripened fruits, and breaks in rhapsody Of perfect love from love-made-perfect flowers, Flows into me, holds converse with my soul, Reveals me to myself but as the glass Wherein God's thoughts grow visible, the harp His breathings trouble into melting music; Then haply leaves me as the gleam goes by Some seed of light for pregnant thought to clothe In images of sense, which then I make To serve his need for whom I hold my life. So, with the twanging of the harp, and voices Still mutinous about me, there dropped down Betwixt us, as the curtains of a tent Which shut them from my view; and I sate still,â Still in their midst as in an isle of silence,â While shapes of unrelated men and women Grew to be hollow outlines, ere they vanished As phantoms wholly, leaving me alone With Eurien, and with Bronwen, and one other Who came among us,ânay, how there I asked not, Borne on a wave of moonlight as it seemed,â And stood inclined towards us, with her arms At rest upon the board, her face uplifted Gazing in Eurien's eyes that saw her not, With love and pity at their highest flood, Drowning her own. Then knew I she was come God-sent to speed the battle for a soul Against the powers of Cythraul, and my heart Grew pure of hate and fear in looking on herâ God's minister, free of the gate of death, God's maiden soldier, who was panoplied In purity alone, bearing no weapon Saving her tempered sword of virgin love. And Eurien, for whose eyes the vision was not, Spoke with the phantom shapes on either hand; But under cover of this shadowy talk I saw his spirit labouring to work Its own confusion; saw the beckoning hand Wherewith he summoned Wythan; heard the words Of deadly meaning leave his guarded lips, And knew that vengeance which a year agone Was buried in our lost one's unknown grave, Was now conjured to rise, a shapeless horror, A foam-crowned wave of evil, in whose downdraught Our Cymri would be drawn the way of doom. Our chieftain watched his message take its round, And met its silent answer with his eyes, As each of his fierce followers in turn Possessed his mind. And all this while it stood,â The heavenly vision of our vanished Mona,â With looks meseemed of all too-human sorrow For one who was a visitor to earth From Gwynfyd, sphere of utter joy in love. And still for him she was, and yet was not, As there he sate unwitting, with the arm Of Bronwen interlacing his,âa staple Locked firmly by her clasping hands,âthe while Her radiant brow, her smile, her bold bright eyes, And breast whereon the jewels heaved and fell With each exulting breath, proclaimed him hers, All hers,âthe bondman of her earth-born beauty. And then I saw not whence it came, but felt That Modwyth brushed my arm in passing near; And lo, on Bronwen's breast there lay a blossom,â Her infant's tender head; and as the rose Shows tenfold fair companioned by the bud, So Bronwen's beauty brightened as she sate, Until it seemed to burn the eyes of men, And voices multitudinous arose And terrified the vision;âthat I knew The guests were all a-foot, their goblets ringing, Their voices pitched together in acclaim Of Eurien's beauteous wife, and Eurien's heir. When all were sat again I sought the place Of the white soul of Mona. It was gone. And Eurien's glances, caught upon the tide Of others' eyes, as is the wont of men, Fell vanquished upon Bronwen, and he bent And plucked from off the board some woven ears Of wheat, and drowsy poppy blooms, with hearts Black as from burning; so he crowned her triumph, And taking Dafyth's harp within his hand, Stood over her and sung. This was his lay:â Mountain rose single and sweet, Beaten upon by the wind and the rain, Far from the passage of dainty feet, Shedding thy perfume as treasure in vain; Spreading a feast for the good of the bees, Coining your heart into golden grain For the murmuring guest and the wandering breeze To speed or to scatter in dull disdain;â Hard, fruitful life, pale mountain rose, Whose seed through the ages grows, still grows.â Rose of the valley, costly fair,â A cup fulfilled with its own delight,â Doubly closed from the eager air, From the busy day, and the vulgar sight; Plucked for my lady's peerless breast, To perish upon it or ever at night She draws it forth from its balmÃ«d rest,â Its winding-sheet so blinding white; Soft, fruitless life, fair double rose, Dead in thy passion's barren throes! O single flower, whose lip uncurled Sets free the virtues of its heart, Whose riches are for all the world, Whose beauty doth itself dispart,â Say, canst thou make a home for joy Secure as that which subtlest art Hath folded in,âso deep, so coy,â A maze that hath nor clue nor chart? Say fruitful life, say single rose, Whose seed through the ages grows, stillââ He paused upon a note; the broken stave, Crushed by his fingers on the harp, died out In a grieved sigh, and golden Eurien stood Rapt, silent, motionless, an ivory image With harp in hand, and gleaming hair spread out In quivering rays; an image as of one Caught in a sudden ecstasy of awe. And I, GlÃ¢n-Alarch followed with mine eyes His gaze, and in the ghostly, sheeted moonbeams Gleaming without the oriel, they alighted Upon that same white spirit which late had looked On Eurien from the table,âMona's spirit,â The sad, wide eyes o'ercharged with love and tears Seeming to let their treasure overflow And glorify her face, baptising it With sorrow touched with purest light of heaven. Even as I looked, the vision failed once more, Dropped, and was quenched as drops and dies a spark, And Eurien when I sought him in his place, Had vanished too, the harp of Dafyth lying Broken upon the floor, and Bronwen sitting Pale and undone beneath her conqueror's crown, The infant wailing at her breast unheeded, Its tendril fingers and soft flexile lips Seeking to reach the fount of motherhood, Clinging by turns, and spurning at the gems,â The hard bright stones that mocked its baffled quest. Then I too rose and followed Eurien forth Into the night; I knew that he had gone To seek that guiding spirit, to hold speech And question with it, if such thing might be. The court, but only for the sounds that welled From out the hall, was silent as a corpse Beneath its sheet of moonlight; the black shadows Immovable as mutes and funeral trappings About its bastioned walls. He was not there. And then I looked where white, with rifts of shadow, The mighty flanks of Moel-Wythfa rose And fell,âa waste of all incertitudes; Then swept the spaces north and south and west, With glances far and near; alike in vain; Till from the hall the parting guests swarmed out In murmurous companies, which took their way Over the hills and valleys here and there And sent a stir of life through the dead world. I waited through the still small hours of night, And waited when the hours yet small, were still No longer; when the wind that churned the sea And skimmed the waves blew salt upon my lips, Sent a wild host of clouds disorderly Over the setting moon's serener state, And bore aloft the loosened bramble leaves; Or hunted as a hound with nose to earth Forcing the secrets of the silent sod, And, getting scent of them, threw a shrill note Keen through the night, and sped upon its way. Then overhead the windy current paused; Crag-Eyrie was besmeared, a vapoury blot, Black on the luminous veil that wrapped the moon, While still the unchained winds hunted the ground Which seemed to find a voice and answer back. I waited restless, trembling; less in fear Than expectation; something pitched too high For the worn instrument so wrought upon. For Eurien,âthe powers of light were with him, But who should say what sloughs, what gulfs, what darkness, Might lie upon the way which they should lead him? That consummation which in human speech We falsely call the âend,â would be, was, well; But the Time-spirit bore upon me hard, And shook me as the wind the loosened leaves. Then came the soundâoh, welcome on the mountains!â Of Eurien's steps; and through the rifted clouds The stars looked down, and let me see his face. 'Twas Eurien, and not Eurien; a change Had past upon him;ânay, it was all Eurien,â And I had never seen him all till now. He spoke and low, but with a voice which seemed To ring against the starry floor of heaven And thence return to overflow mine ear: âShe lives, GlÃ¢n-Alarch; I have looked on her, Have heard her voice; she lives for Wales and me; Love will not let her spirit free of us,â Death cannot hold her,âlove has conquered it!â He ceased to speak, and I, the elder seer, Waited his mood in silence. Then he turned, Facing the castle: âThere I saw her stand, When at the feast, where I had lost myself, She found me with her eyes. GlÃ¢n-Alarch mine, How knew you that the dead could speak to us? My eyes, my ears, are open now as yours.â I said âMy son, they speak to awful purpose.â Then he: âShe lives, and I,âif I live too, Who should have perished in the cloud which made Crag Eyrie one black sea of yawning graves,â I live to do her bidding.â âI had past Beyond that Clogwyn, whither my spirit bore me In quest of her who had been rapt away, Lost while my soul seemed fastened upon hers, When the cloud came,âshe in it, though I wist not; It came, it compassed me, a sable wall; Then but for her, each step had been a step Towards death; for the fierce winds arose, and drove me, A vessel tost amongst the unseen rocks And eddies, that I bade farewell to life; When at my side a voice from out the darkness Whispered me softly: âFollow, Eurien, follow!â And I did follow blindly where she led, For it was Mona's voice, and Mona's heart Beating so near mine own I seemed to hear it; But no, believe me not,âthat could not be, The vision had no part in that; that was The heightened life, and double beat of mine. âAnd still that voice before me seemed to rise From out the ground where step by step my foot Met the hard rock; still âEurien, follow, Eurien!â And still I followed, walking as she led me, Walking I knew not whither,âif to death Or to some end of life yet hid from me; Till following, and still following her, the cloud Grew lighter as I reached its burnished edge, And then I knew that hanging on that voice Through a black hour of peril, I had past Safely the awful ridge of Crib-y-dysgull; And so, in growing light, I followed still The voice now faint, and fainter, till the breeze Which bore it to me, almost seemed to claim it; And now from off the vale it floated back, Still âFollow, Eurien, follow,â till I came Well nigh to Garth, and then the words were changed: âTeudric and Tinternâ was the burthen now Laid on my heart, until the voice was gone, Expiring on the road which leads to them.â âTeudric and Tintern;â I had caught these words On Eurien's lips before; for as I think They long had been the watchwords of true thoughts Which strove to win a way to outer act. âBehold, GlÃ¢n-Alarch, these my hands, ere now They had been still for kites and earns to play with And part the fingers; if I hold them thus, It is that they were spared for stouter work Than to chastise a nettle that hath stung us Who grapple in a serpent's deadly folds. No, by my faith, they shall not let the blood Of Cymri forth to smell in Cymric nostrils And move the beast in Cymric hearts to ravin. If now I live, I live as one new born, And born for Britain. No more dazed or drifted By doubt and wrath, or stagnate in the shallows The weak call Fate, I swear through mirk and mist To hold the highest hope, and follow it With will as strong as will of man may be,â Such will being Franklin to the will of God. The man who hath no call to lead the herd May waken to the task the sleeping herdsman; The stalwart arm may prompt the dreamy head; He who is not a saving light may lift A saving voice.â He paused; my heart was so At one with him, I knew not if I spoke, But he it was who said: âThe light now waxeth; It may be, as it spreads, that we no more Shall see it shining as a star apart In men who are as gods upon the earth; That in the growing manhood of the world Each one shall be a candle to himself; That Teudric, whose great heart hath all but 'scaped The flesh that lies so light on it, and Eurien, And Mowric, and no better men, shall be The kings of battle in the days to come;â Not such as Arthur fresh from Avalon, Nor any with God's seal upon their brows. Wherefore, GlÃ¢n-Alarch, such as here I stand, I throw myself with every hope of life, Name, fame, joy, pride, all, keeping nothing back, Into that cause all will too poorly serve.â So Eurien, who had laid his vengeance once On Mona's grave, whence evil hands had plucked it, Now cast it from his path in quiet scorn, To free the way whereto her voice had called him. Then Modwyth, dim and dubious as the dawn Now trembling in the east, drew near to us, And Eurien, knowing that the woman's love Was great beyond the joy she had of it, Feared not to show her all his heart and purpose. Whereon we crept like thieves, feeling our way Through the thick sleeping shadows of the hall, Each to his silent chamber, and his thoughts. When Eurien laid his body down to rest, Though wandering still in spirit up and down That cloudy pass of death wherefrom a thread Of silvery sound had saved him, by his side, Robed in the unmoved majesty of sleep, A dreamless nursing mother lay Bronwen. With morning light there came a word to Garth,â A word that had been blown from lip to lip,â Whose airy passage left no trace,âa word That walked in darkness e'en as pestilence, A word that stole, and burst like wind or fire Upon that foregone state which now we called Our peace; the word was one we knew too well; War was the word, and war must be the answer. The Saxon foe had waited not our onslaught; They of the West were marching on the Severn, To hurl defiance at its guardian arm And foul its virgin bosom with the tread Of their marauding hordes; to cross our threshold And dare us with our backs against our mountains, Our feet upon the soil wherein our hearts Were rooted. Such the wandering word that found us, And found us ready, ready to an hour, With a young hope new-born to meet the call. A hasty council had been held at dawn With Mowric, and the chiefs the towers of Garth Had guarded through the night; and Eurien's voice Had rung with sound of such deep heart and true, As set all others ringing in accord. âTeudric the Holyâ was the word of hope Whose way our chieftain won to every heart. While yet the day was young, our lingering guests Left hurriedly; it had been younger still When I and Modwyth, Bronwen and the babeâ His soft cheek flushed with Eurien's parting kissâ Watched a dim figure winding down the slope,â A solitary shape, in palmer's weed, The hooded head close shorn from chin to crown,â And knew that deep beneath that hood there lay A tongue whose silvery matin chime would wake The hermit of the Wyeâour royal Teudric,â If lusty limbs and supple wit, might shear A path for it through hordes of gathering Saxons. Eurien, his costly life within his hand, Was gone to call our saint from silent prayer To hear God's answer in the tongue of war,â To raise in view of our distracted Cymri A flag of happy omen, which should draw them From the vain shallows of divided aims, To the broad ocean where the breath of God Wafts men and peoples on life's grand highways. But Bronwen smote her hand upon the stone Whereon she leaned, and lifted angry eyes: âThus have we come to see a king of Snowdon Steal from his gates,âthe eagle grown an owl,â And following on a guest as bare of honour As the shorn head is of its golden wealth.â No word had I to spare, for thought of Modwyth, Whose farewell blessing, ringing hard as steel, Had shaken her, that now she leaned her arm On mine in sudden quailing as she said: âThat face beneath the hood was e'en as Gwynion's; God grant it be not gone from me as hers!â And true it was that Eurien's beardless lip Had changes swift and sweet as his dead sister's. Then both to her and Bronwen and my heart I answered: âWe can never see him greater; His hand was ever free to yield his goods, But now he gives up pride and praise of men, Showing himself thereby a son of God Who scatters while his hirelings scrape and gather.â We watched him till he faded in the mist Which clomb the mountain's side as he went down it, Following in faith the visionary words, âTeudric and Tintern.â Then we turned within And faced with our full hearts the empty house. III And now lone Garth seemed stricken as with death, Falling upon a life too clamorous, And quitted in disorder; but beneath This sullen semblance, stirred in some of us A quickened pulse of life; our quiet breath Was warely drawn that it should bar no sound; Our lips clung closer that our ears were open; Our eyes forbore to meet, lest they in meeting Might flash upon a doubt. On Modwyth's distaff The flax nor waxed nor waned, while ghost-like, noiseless She flitted through the house; but when one day We met together by the glowing hearth, And Bronwen to the infant in her armsâ For she with us was stricken silent tooâ Made moan that she was left a woeful woman, Twice widowed with a babe upon her hands, To tie them, or to burthen her in flight,â Modwyth looked coldly on the rounded cheek Whence mortal shafts had glanced as from a ball: âI give my son to Wales, whose cause is God's, As freely as God gave my son to me.â She said; and in the jet of fiery speech Flushed as the snow which rounds a burning crater. And then she wandered forth, as was her wont At eventide, when toiling hands were free, And pass'd from roof to roof, lowly and pervious To driving winds, and blasts of bitter fate, In tender ministration; but this night The woman might have been a gleaming brand, Or rod of steel, to call a heart of flame From wood or stone; no hearth so cold, no heart So weary, but she struck from it an answer. And I, whose heart was all a-flame as hers, Whose hand was all as weak, still burned to speed Our sacred cause,âmake fit for Eurien's grasp The tools, and gather for his work. My thoughts Still ran on Cynorac, he who held his thralls In such fierce practice of the game of war As made them worth the winning. 'Twas enough That treachery, I know not how enacted, Had marred the emollient power of Eurien's gift; I thought the tongue that had left off to sing, Might yet avail to speak; the idle breath To clear the cloud of lies, to heal and sweeten The gangrened sore with truth. So on a day I summoned Methuen, he who has in charge My silent harp, or leads the galloway That bears it as my sign of minstrel state When far I journey; him I called, and took My staff in hand, and facing Moel-Wythfa, Toiled up the path I loved, breathing new life And hope with each new step. When near the summit, On Crib-y-dysgull, my white hairs were taken And spread in one long pennon on the wind, I laughed to think I bore a flag of truce No manly foe would scorn. So down we went With quickened steps, and came to where men dwell, And breathe the common air; and as we neared The Pass and left the silence of the heights, We heard from out the covert of the fern The ceaseless crooning of that fierce love-plaint Wherewith the stag seeks pity of the hind. We past the creatures by, and scattered them O'er brake and boulder; all but one, the weary And weightily-crowned monarch of the herd, Who reared his antlered head in proud defiance, Rose to his feet, and followed with faint steps And few, then sank upon his doubled knees Forlorn, and laid his glory in the dust. I, moved with pity for the humbled despot, By friend and fere deserted in his need, Bade Methuen hasten to the ranger's house And bring him help of man to live or die. So I descended to the Pass alone, And wandered lonely by the troubled river That beats its way among the rocks, and roars For very desolation. I, GlÃ¢n-Alarch, The ruin of a man, and of a bard, Wandering amongst the ruins of a world. And lonely as I went, a warning note, As of a bird that signals to its young, Struck dubious on my ear that had not lost Its woodcraft; and I looked, and lo! before me Leaning upon his staff, stood silent Peter, The shepherd of the Pass; and as I gazed Into his eyes that read the stars, I thought But marvelled notâthat they were deep and secret. Then straight above the fretting of the waters There rose and fell, ere I had fairly caught it, The quick, impatient whine of some dumb joy, Silenced I thought by human voice unheard. Then all the ruined world took shape of life. To my perplexÃ«d sense; the riven rocks Tumbled about the valley,âshattered crowns Of mountain kings that frowned upon their fallâ Had shadows full of secrets as the eyes And signal of the shepherd. I sate silent; I looked, I listened. Sheer in face of me The tortured Glyder showed his haggard side, Filed by the glacier drifts, lashed by the storm, Mined by the floods, gnawn by the hungry frost, The but of all the forces of the world, Biding the end in sullen scorn of pain. There, rended from his brow, lodged in the vale Close by the river's bed, I marked a rock Which, hurled on other twain, had made betwixt them A cavern whence, as there I sate, there came A voice of song so deep, so sweet, so strange, Yet so familiar to mine ear withal, That as it rose and poised itself aloft Betwixt the savage Glyder and Crib-Coch, I thought that o'er that chaos, wreck, and ruin, Where death hath made his dwelling with despair, I heard the breathing of the spirit of life, The soul of order and of harmony, Which I had sought for day and night, and found, And lost, and found to lose again, and seek With growing love, and growing pain of loss Throughout the glimpses of the universe. The very Glyder softened to the song And crowned himself with patience; and the stream Murmured no more, but leaped upon his way Rejoicing in his strength. I too rejoiced; The more because the Angel of the Presence,â She who had borne to me this day the word Of life wasâyes, I saw her there, beside The cavern's open mouth,âMona, the youngest And dearest of the spirits; as I looked I grasped the stone beneath me; firm, all firm, Although the Glyder seemed to reel, as slowly She moved towards me, and with voice of speech Sweet as her song, though lower, with like potence Subtly to shape the roar of life to music, She, looking on me sadly, laid a hand Which was not of a spirit, on my brow And softly said: âYou sing no more, GlÃ¢n-Alarch.â I answered not. I thought the grave had opened And given forth the dead. I knew this Mona Had come through other than the gate of vision. She spoke again: âYou sing no more, GlÃ¢n-Alarch; Is it because you thought your merle was silent? Now you have heard her sing, you too will sing.â Alas, I could but weep for joy and sorrow, Fighting against my tears that I might see, Pressing my brow against her gentle hand, Straining her other hand against my breast And songless lips, then joining both my own In prayer and futile blessing on her head; Till wrath of that which was her lot o'ercame me, And up I rose and asked in bitter scorn What miracle had spared her life for thisâ For this, the last cold mockery of fate? She answered hurriedly, as one not noting The dissonance; then sweeping with her glance All paths of access, saw we were alone, And breathed more freely: âI was saved, GlÃ¢n-Alarch,â Made free of the unlovely flesh, which still Had been to him a bond or a reproach, And set to do him service as a spirit, And as a disembodied soul, to grow Dearer, more lovely in the light of thought, Yet dwell with him on the same plane of being, And breathe with him the sweet air of the world;â Saved as by miracle, from the base joy Of living as a beggar on his bounty,â A beggar with one plea, that I was blind;â Saved, saved from this, to do the thing whereto My spirit, poorly housed, was sent by God: To watch him as his shadow, and to gather Here, in the silence of my hidden life, God's message in the wind and in the stars, And bear him when his senses are perturbed By grosser clamour of his working days.â She swept me with her as a stream of music Floats us away unquestioning, and lands us To walk awhile upon the golden sands Of some high strand, and wake as from a dream, Yet waking still to hold within our grasp Some gathered treasure which affirms all true. She swept me with her, but I held her hands Lest she should vanish, and her swifter spirit Leave me behind; I clung to her,âthe child,â I, old and grey GlÃ¢n-Alarch,âfor she floated Where I had all but sunk. Then she again: âI learnt the truth of Bronwen; it was truth Which then she spoke; would God she knew no other! My love was not a flower to grace his life; I stood before him as a rod, which never Would blossom in his hand. I cried to God To hide me from my love and Eurien's truth; And then I know no more, but that I fell, And falling grasped unknowingly, the sapling Which grows from out the rock where it breaks off Sheer, jagged, dreadful, and was shot from it In rising, as an arrow from a bow,â Shot clear of danger from the jutting crags, And dropped into the tallest of those trees That rise from out the stunted grove there striving Towards Clogwyn Cromlech. When I woke to life, I lay within the pliant, leafy branches, Which swayed upon the stem as sways a cradle, And thought I was new-born; I had no mother,â But that was nothing strange. I lay awhile Faint, weary, something soothed, till stung with thought As new-born things with hunger, I crept down And touched again the stony earth, and fled From all which had been, and could be no more, Setting Crag-Eyrie 'twixt my love and me. Since when, I dwell with Peter, here.â She paused; I held her hands as in a drowning clasp; I looked at her as I would reach her soul. Her cheek was pale,âit ever had been pale,â Her eyes were darker, deeper, deep as lakes That lie in shadow of the purple mountains; The hands I held, abandoned now to mine, Slender and soft, were instinct with a power Which could have slipt their bonds had she so willed it, As summer buds their sheaths. I felt the life Latent within them; saw it play about The reticent beauty of her maiden contours, The limbs so firmly poised, and the shut lips Of which she held such gentle mastery,â And knew that she was filled with the strong breath Of morning on the mountains! I had been A fighter in my time, and knew the joy Of conflict, and the stirrings of high heart That meet and cope with fate; so clinging still To Mona's yielded hands, she drew me on, That I grew brave for her as she was brave, And kept back curses which had frightened song. There as she sate she bade me swear to guard Her secret as I loved her peace; I swore; Then told her whereunto my steps were bound, And of my hope of winning Cynorac To join our levies with his men at arms. âGlÃ¢n-Alarch you will prosper, he will join them!â I missed the music from her voice, and pressed Bare palms together as she wrung her hands: âFalse, false, GlÃ¢n-Alarch, false to him, thrice false!â Then sharp above her cry of pain, there pierced The signal of the shepherd. One short moment She fell into my arms, and in her eyes Rose the dumb yearning of some patient brute, While on my cheek her filial kisses clung And tore my heart away with them; again: âGlÃ¢n-Alarch, Bard of Glyneth, you will sing;â Let me not live to think I murder music!â Then fled, and left me clutching at the air. The hues had faded from her bardic mantle, And as a creature under seal of nature She melted into mist among the rocks; Only my sense was guided to the cavern By Myneth's chastened welcome, as I sate And gazed thereon till Methuen with the palfrey Bearing my harp drew near; when I arose And trod the downward path along the Pass, Reeling as one made drunk, I knew not whether Of joy or sorrow. Then I touched the chords; I fain had done her bidding, but my heart, My troubled heart still barred the way of song; And silently, with downcast looks I went, Shamed by the brave pure breath of the racked Glyder Wandering amongst my harp's discordant strings. One time the tale of Cynorac's surrender Had waked some note of triumph; but not now; I tell it, but the earth, and eke the heavens Are thronged and overflowed with such high tidings, It falls as a sole wave of a wild sea; I tell it, but the sound is overborne. So came we to the lake where Cynorac Keeps his disordered state; the quiet mirror Where many a deed of violence is glassed; And took our greeting firstly from the dogs That pressed upon our steps in clamorous question. My bardic robe and sorry flag of truce Won us our way within. I gave my greeting, And put my question too: âHad Eurien's gift And courteous message haply met mischance?â Then Cynorac, who is curious in oaths, Leaving his place among his lounging followers, Whose eyes were heavy as with some late orgie, Swore by his gods and saints, that never gift, Nor aught at Eurien's hand had come his way, But blows betwixt their people in time past, And later, poisonous words, to make ill blood, And taunts to stir up strife.â I heard and waited, Letting him rage the wind from out his lungs Before I took the word. Then I laid bare The lies that had been sown as dragons' teeth Betwixt our chief and him. I said the heart Of Eurien now was all subdued to love Of our wild Wales, so had no corner left For jealous variance with our mother's sons. And as I spoke, my tears, my love o'erflowed, And words that as I struggled in the Pass Had tried to shape themselves in song, but found No tuneful way, being pressed and overborne By weight of my sad spirit, now broke loose, Fell molten from my kindling heart to theirs, Touching them with its fire, till they too kindled, Even to the rudest of the rout, and rose And striking hands, took God and man to witness, As they had Cymric hearts within their breasts, That Eurien's love in them should find its answer. And then they set me in a chair of state, Whose broideries hung around in tattered flags; Cleared the torn rushes round my feet, of bones The dogs had gnawed, and propped them on a stool; Then called to set on meat, and plied us both With mead and ale. And so we ate their salt, And went away content with what was won. Silent when next we past it, was the cave,â Cold virgin chamber, wind and storm-wrought nest,â Whereon I dared not looked with Methuen near; But later, when we reached the highest step Of homeward progress, on our view there burst Another world,âa world of life and hope And motion, wakened since we twain had left it Sleeping in silence of the dawn. Swift shapes Traversed the vales, or clomb the skirts of hills In lines that had their centre each in Garth, Which lay beneath us like a swarming hive Pressed by a moving and a murmurous crowd. High on its highest turret waved the sanguine Standard of the Pendragonate; beneath it, The flag of Eurien's house,âthe golden eagle Spread on a snowy field. Our hearts leapt up; We stood a moment breathless, then our feet Put off the clogs of Time, and took on wings; I lighted from the galloway, I felt My swifter blood must bear me swiftlier home. Eurien was there, and Teudric had been won: So much the crowd and waving emblems told us. And as we went, and shadows of the night Began to gather on the hills, the glow Of furnaces within the courts of Garth Grew redder, till we saw the sparks thrown off, And heard the hammers ring upon the steel Of arms the smiths were forging in hot haste. And still as we came down, the swarm of men Was moving, thinning round the castle walls, As pickets under native convoy, went To quarters in the hamlets strown around. The hour was then upon us; the long year Of waiting sped at length; our day of vengeance Come at the last,âI saw it in the sky Where a torn wreath of cloud, like flying squadrons, Gory with many a gash, which seemed to drop And stain the bloody shield of Lynn-y-Gader,â Was driven to the east,âthe plundering Sassenach Was driven backward to the East, our Cymri Avenged and free: I saw it writ in heaven! I forced a passage through the throng to Eurien, Who stood within its midst, its heart, its head, His knights around him, and his squires still going, Bearing his mandates, faring back to him With tidings from without, carrying his life Through all the heaving body. With my heart That bounded to my lips and held them silent, I hailed him to his place; he clasped my hand, And beamed on me a moment; then he threw His arm athwart my shoulder, pressing it As he would make me proud by leaning there; So ended that whereon his mind was set, Yet wound me in the current of his life. When Eurien's thought was woven into act,â Spun off as silk that leaves a full-charged shuttle,â And in the pause he turned again on me, I showed him where the Saxon squadrons fell, Stumbling upon the corpses of the slain, Followed by that wild cloud of vengeful Cymri. Even as we looked the gory hues were quenched, A lurid pallor wrapped the fallen host; I whispered: âSee, their wounds are staunched in death.â We paused a moment gazing on their ruin, While gathering hoards of Cymri sweeping past them Pursued a scattered remnant to the east. I said: âSee now, we drive them o'er their borders! He answered: âWhere, God willing, we will keep them;â Then turned him to his task. When somewhat later,â The last armed picket wending down the hill, The crowd dispersed, the knights and squires withdrawn, And we two left alone but for the hammers Whose mighty strokes held fast the workmen's sense,â He told me what I burned to hear; that Teudric, Our roused Pendragon, our recovered Arthur, Had left the border land betwixt two worlds Where he had dwelt in prayer and happy vision, To come among us struggling in the slough, Divided in the darkness, and to draw us Together in one brotherhood of hope. Teudric was at Glamorgan, where his standard Was rallying a warlike host, which joined By Eurien's levies, with his brother chieftains, Would march and greet the foe on this side Severn. Then Eurien leaning on the parapet As somewhat weary, asked me of the journey Whereof no soul at Garth possessed the secret When forth I went at dawn. I too sat down, And over him I broke my joyful news, Even as the woman broke the box of spikenard Whose precious balms should ease her weary lord. I told him how that I, his old GlÃ¢n-Alarch, Led by a hope that came, I said not whence, Had faced the lion Cynorac in his den, And laying on him with his heavy wrongs To Eurien and to Wales, had stormed his heart And made it captive to our cause. He rose,â Oh, joy of triumph tasted yet again!â He rose up stronger for my precious balms, And stood before me 'twixt the rising moon And dusky glare of forges, that I saw The hope of all our lives whose flame is fanned By every breath that blows, burn in his eye, And knew it rapt him to some high, clear place Of 'vantage whereâour very failures takeâ Nay, that is nought, but whereâI can no more; Words come not as I call them to my lips, And shall not force their way in my despite! I am no prophet to be set to curse Where I would bless; peace heart! or break in silence. I talked of joy and triumph, mine and Eurien's, Known in the cause for which we hold our lives; I find the note again, I make it ring; What a false instrument is man, when time Has slacked his chords! Ay, Eurien was joyful, He said: âWe now shall march to meet the foe, No man among us stayed by self-made wounds; You, my GlÃ¢n-Alarch, you have cured the last, Now we shall go forth whole.â Whereon he called His trusted Wythan, gave him first his share In present joy, then told him he must wake The morrow from its lazy couch of rest, And shame it,âshame it even on the brow Of Moel-Wythfa, as he bore the standard Glowing to Cynorac, and therewith the word: âFor Teudric and the bleeding heart of Britain!â Then we who caught his fire, wrung out the cry: âFor Teudric and the bleeding heart of Britain!â When Wythan went, I pressed him: âWhat of Teudric, How bears he the Pendragonate once borne, And haply to be borne again, of Arthur?â He said: âHe bears it royally, not bowing Either beneath it, or his weightier years. He turns a face on men that still is shining As from the face of God. The chiefs behold him And press to do him reverence; farther off, The people see, and hail him for their saviour. He works unwearied, sleeplessly, as though The battle-field should be his bed of rest. Time has but calmed, not cooled him, such in that As you may grow to be, the Fates assenting.â 'Twas then I asked of him a boon, which long Had trembled at my heart: âChief, not so old Your ancient Bard but he can fight beside you?â Then a great pity quenched the hopeful light Of Eurien's gaze; and so my doom fell on me Before he spoke: âGlÃ¢n-Alarch, we must change Our places if you cannot bide to shield With wisdom, and with valour, as may be, From dangers of our too-unguarded coast, The mother, child, and wife I leave behind me.â I said no more; I was not born a king, And saw the joy of battles was a joy Foregone with all the rest. I could have wept, But that my chieftain's sorrowing gaze withheld me; And then our work, which shamed self-pleasing thought; The treasure of our house, left in my hand By Eurien, must be cared for; we concerted Together of the means, how best to make The little seem the more. When all was said, In passing by the forges, where the hammers Were ringing still their deadly chimes, he paused, And from his girdle took the leaden ball Clasped by that silver hand with rings be-gemmed, And cast it in the hottest of the furnace. Then to the smith who broke off work, he said: âHollow me out a chamber in that falchion, And furnish with the metal melting there; Build it well in, the falchion is for me,â The gems for any here who care to glean them.â He waited till the weapon was matured, Then took it, and for proof, upon the anvil Let fall a stroke or two. His arm was strong, His fire-lit face as an avenging god's. We went our way; he looked up clear to heaven Which, ere the moon had lost her perfect shape, Would cease to be his debtor for an oath. The women all were busy in the house As we without, but rose as we twain entered, And stood before their work as children use When making gifts which shall surprise a feast-day. The morrow, when the sun had past the height Of noon, the ancient towers of Garth-y-Gwin Looked down upon the gathered host, which waited The coming but of Cynorac to march. Our chief was in the hall, with all the flower Of Snowdon and its border chivalry,â A glittering crescent,âwhen the glad huzzas Announced the friend, but late the midnight foe, First seen by us to head his desperate troop In open sunlight. Boisterous was the greeting Wherewith methought some seemly shame was covered; But Eurien's gracious manhood and frank speech, Confessed at first, then turned the blotted page Of memory, as he bade a squire bring forth The sacred drinking-cup, our deep blue HÃ®rlas; Which filled, he pledged the future of our love, Then filled again, and gave to Cynorac, While brimming horns of mead were served around, And knight and squire advanced to strike the HÃ®rlas And make it ring in sign of true accord. It came to Weroc's turn; he was the last; His eyes were downcast, but he raised his horn To touch the sacred vessel. When his hand Moved forward to its aim, it met but air, Dumb, and without resistance. Cynorac Was draining the deep draught within the cup. He set it down: âI make no pledge with traitorsâ Was all he said. He turned away, and quickly The two were sundered by a wall of men, And Weroc, abject, dumb but for an oath Which rattled half unuttered in his throat, Fell back among the women. Cynorac Had struck the scent since yesterday. Our chief Looked on in stern misgiving; then he said: âNo hand so black but Saxon blood will purge it.â His eyes were fixed on Weroc, and so followed The glance the caitiff stole at Bronwen. She Was pale as is the froth upon the mead; The fair, soft hand she steadied on the board, Clung like the talon of a bird of prey, And Eurien saw her lip and cheek grow rigid, Fierce with a passion that to him was strange, Not scorn of baseness, flash of righteous wrath,â Only the slow, cold cruelty of fear. A question trembled on his lips and died there, Where like a corpse it stopped the way, and chilled The parting kiss exchanged between these two. Then Eurien turned, nor gave one look behind, But beckoned with the hand to lord and knight, And past into the court, where Cynorac Sprung to his stirrup, when with one clear bound Our chieftain vaulted mail-clad to the saddle; Then faced the troops, formed now in line of march, And, off a dark cloud, shining like a star, He said: âMy brother knights, and ye, my children,â We who stand here, the right arm of our country, We go to join our high, anointed Head, Teudric, of all the saints of God the saintliest, So worthiest of them all to bear His message Of vengeance for the slaughter of His saints! We go to join our Head,âour new-found Head,â And pair with other limbs that join with us; God give that we content ourselves and them,â God give that we content ourselves and Him!â Our chief drew in the circle of his gaze, And then went on: âIn the fair olden time There have been foes who, met in generous strife, Have hand to hand, and eye to eye, together Lived through a spell of such high-seasoned joy As well had crowned a banquet of the gods. So won they then, or lost, they took their fate As men, and of the lusty time so shared The lusty foe went not without his part In memory: men were grateful for their joy. But friends, the Sassenach, though brave he be, Is a hard foe, unknightly, villainous,â No joy, no pride of him, but in his fall; No hope for us, but in his overthrow! But joy and pride,âthese be no words to suit Our mood this day,âbut toys for happier time; For burning wrong, no joy but burning vengeance; Nay, vengeance even may be ornament Too bright as yet for lives so bare as ours. Brethren and children! we go forth to-day To wrest from the brute foe the leave to live,â To live and labour on our hills, and breathe Unshamed the pure air caught upon their heights,â Which taken, we will see to crown our lives With all which makes life worth the toil of men.â Our chieftain spoke, then raised his voice on high, Giving the cry whereto all voices joined: âFor Teudric and the bleeding heart of Britain!â So the long line moved forward down the slope, Sun-smitten, brightening in its winding course As some huge, changeful dragon, jewel-headed. We followed with our eyes and with our prayers, And saw the bannered legion pass beneath A rainbow's two-fold arch, which spanned a cloud Dense, purple, strange,âcharged full of mystery, While overhead a silvery veil of mist, Shook down a shower of drops, whereon the sun Smote brightly as they fell, tear-shaped, like pearls, But more than diamonds glistering on the gloom. Then we who saw this turbid wave sweep forward To break itself in deadly shock of war, Felt as a crew becalmed upon a sea Whose dangers were the quiet face of death. The days crept on; the hunger of suspense, Cheated at first by needful toil, erewhile Gnawed at our hearts. Then came to our relief An envoy sent by Eurien; his contingent Had joined the host of Teudric, and fresh forces To that were gathered daily. The hot breath Which blew the word of war from north to south Had found us of the north, like smouldering fire, Ready to leap at once to angry flame; Those of the south, like fuel somewhat green, Yielding an answer tardier, if as sure. The eddies of the bitter wintry winds Wound round our house of Garth as they would tear Its roots from out the earth, and found us waiting, Still waiting while the hosts on each side Severn Strengthened themselves, and grew, and waited too, Watchful by day and night as envious beasts That guard their dens, and roar out fierce defiance, Yet keep their ground, seeking with feints to tempt Each other to the onslaught. For our Britonsâ They would not budge; their backs were to their mountains, Their feet firm-planted on the soil they loved; They curbed their native ardour, and still waited Where most they felt their strength, to give the Saxon His deadly welcome. People passionate! Charged with the burthen of the unborn Time! Hard-hunted Cymri,âeasy to beguile, Tender, if fierce, fierce only in defence,â Or urged, or stung by mighty love or wrong,â Ye areâI see it writ as by the finger Of God upon the table of our hillsâ Are of the women races of the world: Forward to ripen, apt to droop and wither Unripened where the season's breath is harsh, But bearing quick within ye, living, dying, The embryonic hopes of human kind! In these slow days, while Modwyth sat and spun, Setting her face as if against the wind, Looking as though her body had been left A house deserted, while her spirit wandered Beside the tented borders of the Severn, My thoughts, more restless, travelled to and fro, My heart divided, sometimes lingered near; And every day at dawn I tuned my harp,â But never dawn or day found voice to sing. And while we twain were wrapped in silent thought, Bronwen, whose ear was set to every sound, Would start if but the ivy flapped the lintel; And often she would stand and strain her eyes Towards Caereg-Havod, and burst forth in sudden, Bitter bewailment of her state, that she, Who thought to shield her widowhood beneath The strongest arm in Britain, should be left, A mark for Saxon fury, in this den Wherefrom all lusty manhood had departed. When Modwyth on a day took up the babe And laid it in her arms to comfort her, She wept but angrier tears, and hailed the child Forsaken of his father, left to perish; Said that the house of Eurien would be swept Clean from the earth, and nought of her be left But Poplet, happy that he dwelt with strangers. And then she turned on us, calling on all Who loved their lives to seek a home of refuge At Havod, where the lords had spared their own, And stayed to shield the lives that hung thereon. But we who honoured Eurien's young wisdom, Crowned by authority of long descent, Judged of his thought for us as of a thing We might translate in freedom of our love, But never could amend in form or substance. And pitying the heart that was so faint, We made a silence for her words to die in As unrecorded curses, or brute bleatings. And when the air was pure of them, then Modwyth Arose, and laying hands on Bronwen's shoulders As she would draw her to some loftier plane, Cried fervently: ââLift up your heads, ye gates, Be ye lift up ye everlasting doors, That so the King of glory may come in!ââ But Bronwen turned away, and drooped the more. Then came the tidings that the Sassenach Had crossed our borders, and we knew that now, E'en now, the while we gazed in speechless passion Into each other's faces, they were met,â Our Cymri and that foe insatiate, Locked in the fierce embrace of war. The earth, The air, the sun, the stars that shot as arrows Athwart the sky at night, the birds, the beasts, Each one of these was charged with its portentâ The which we knew not alway how to read. One such had well-nigh come, which, had it come, Had silenced hope. What time we watched the stars, The fire upon the hearth,âkindled in spring From the great heart of fire, the sun himself, Caught in a lens at the high feast of BÃ¢ltÃ¢n,â The bÃ¢ltÃ¢n, or sacred fire, was brought down from the sun by means of a lens, at the spring solstice to which our festival of Easter corresponds. No hearth was held sacred unless the fire on it had been re-lit from the bÃ¢ltÃ¢n, or from fire borrowed from it. Had perished in our absence; not a spark Remained to sight, but as a winding sheet Wan ashes wrapt the wood. Without a word, Trembling, aghast, we dropped upon our knees; We blew new breath of life into the embers, And hope leapt up with the reviving flame; Our hearts had died within us had we failed. The silence seemed to fill the house, and drove me To wander forth; I rose up from the hearth, I left my blessing on the infant's sleep, And taking staff in hand, with hasty steps, Over the hills I followed my full heart. Over the hills,âthe valleys could not hold me,â Over the hills which shut me off from Eurien, Where, as I strove against their heaving sides, The burthen of the silence fell from off me. The world was fair; it could not be his tomb; I thought he lived, and lived to breathe the breath Of brother's praise, and mount with it as mounts A prayer uplift from many hearts at one. And then I thought how he, the only one Of all our Cymric chiefs, had sought to set Above his own a name more reverend With eld, and garnered deeds of wider fame; And thinking thus, meseemed that mightier force Would bear his soul on high, than praise of men, Which was but as the smoke of priestly censers:â True fire of sacrifice sent up to Him Who is the living soul of sacrifice. And then with chastened joy I seemed to see My chieftain's face in twilight, which the time Would turn to darkness; and the wide-winged eagle Which topped his helm, all shadowy to the eyes Of men, but burning full in sight of God. So on I went, swept forward by my thoughts, Forgetful of the way, until I fell, In failing light and strength, upon a bare And ruddy root of pine. My outstretched hand Lighted among the needles of the bank, Whence, with its stately peers, the tree sent up Its dark embowered arms to meet the sky. Then faint with fast and wearihead, which caught me All unannounccd, as falls a tropic night, I stretched my limbs in rapture of repose Prone on the needles of the shadowy pines. I think more often than in days gone by My body, like a withered husk, which sheds Its seeds around for wandering winds to scatter, Lets forth my yearning spirits; that the vision, Which comes not through the common gates of life, Is readier now to wrap me than of old, And waft me, or some ripened part of me, Where I may look upon the unknown face, Or see the upraised hand, of coming fate. I ceased to think, or thought no more within The caverned dome which serves my common use; My knowledge grew, and filled a vaster sphere; Our righteous cause was glorious, Eurien triumphed, But over both a vast and regal shade, With on its head a crown I knew to be Of martyrdom fell, and eclipsed the brightness; The riven bosom of the earth had opened, And closed in silence over nobler seed Than that which filled the furrowed fields of Garth. The dead had sunk, with the new-buried grain, To fruitful darkness, and the earth was still, As one bereft; but from the blackest depth Aloft, among the bare bones of the pines, There rose and fell, and fell to rise again, Thick vibrant waves of happy sound, which held My spirit high as if it had been given To hear the triumph of heroic deed Gathering through all the ages. Then there fell Silence on me, as on the earth, perchance The sweet, short death of sleep. When that was past, I started up as one whose sealÃ«d lids Have let in sudden light; and lo, above me, Between the parted branches, gleamed a star, Ruddy like Mars, but not like him obeying An ordered course; this vision of mine eyes Descended swiftly, waxing as it came, Until it was no more a globe, but only A burning house whose smoky reek quenched all The sweet balsamic breathing of the firs. Life of my soul! That burning house was Havod,â The woman standing in the crowd, and wringing Her helpless hands in unavailing prayer To foul-mouthed men, fierce soldiers, Sassenachs,â There to wreak vengeance upon women's sleep,â Was Bronwen, scantly draped as for the night; But, God of day! the babe,âher bedfellow!â Ah, shame upon those breasts which as she beat them Shed sweet, warm, milky tears she feared to quench In fiery search of him for whom they flowed!â The babe was wrapped in dreams or death, cut off Within the burning pile! And still the woman,â The only one of all the house whose hands Were yet untied,âstood begging alien help, Or darting here and there with smothered cries Within the bounds of safety. Then it seemed They mocked her, pointing to the stifling smoke, That colunm rising like a monument Over her infant's grave, and down she sunk, Tame to the hold of their restraining hands, With vacant, wandering eyes, and poor faint heart, Stunned to oblivion almost of its pain, And dropped her arms in credulous despair. Vision that seemed so nigh, and was so far, Mocking the eyes it seared, and cold clenched hands That grappled as with flame,âmy tortured sense Had rent the flesh if longer you had stayed! A hurried moment more, I see them seize her Rudely, and laughing at her disarray, As men made drunken by their own wild deeds. And she,âshe sinks upon the sod before them, Clasping their knees and catching at their hands, Shrieking out prayers for life, bare life, base life, Dear life for all its burning smart of sorrow,â Life she would buy how dear soe'er they priced it. They gather up her helpless limbs between them, And bear her, richest of their spoils, hemmed in By guards, and followed by the sullen household, Who, scarce awake, had found themselves in bonds And fear of flaming death, and now were driven Like cattle down the slope. O God! the silence When all were gone;âthe thick, rank cloud of smoke, And overhead the inaccessible stars! A sound,âa swift, light step, a bounding step, And brush of garments heavy with night dew, Over the withered grass; a dusky shape Wafted to its desire as if on wings, Cleaving unfelt the stagnant wall of smoke And breath of smouldering fire. I heard the step, I saw the shape, I felt the seraph wings, And knew the babe was saved;âsafe, too, that maid Whom nature loved and feared;âI saw no more. Then first my tongue, fast bound, which rage and sorrow Had striven vainly to unloose, gave forth A cry of joy. I rose and looked about me;â Around, the wave of dim, uncertain hills; Above, the darkness of the pines, and through them, The empty field from whence the star had floated. Later, three neat-herds, who had left a steer Dead somewhere on the spurs of Moel-Hebog, Stumbled upon me, fallen by the way, And bore me home to Garth. Thrice happy Garth! The air that was too stagnant for my breathing A while agone, now shook with the strong joy Of fervent souls,âpure light that was sublimed By dew of tender tears. Our cause, God's cause, The cause of humankind in its slow triumph Over the brute that baffles it, was carried Once more, and we might breathe in freedom still The higher life of men. Our golden Eurien Was spared to us, and with a dwindled following Encamped upon the plain of Aber-Glaslyn, There to await the dawn. Our grey Pendragon, He who had bound our wandering loves in one, The saintly Teudric wore the crown of crowns; He walked no more on earth, but as a shade Fell into that possession of the deadâ The ever-present, twice-immortal dead Not wholly hid in God,âthe dead who keep A home for ever in the hearts of men. All this was stirring in the air at Garth, Where eager voices crossed and clashed like cymbals, When down the neat-herds set me in their midst, And silenced them a moment. Every soul But Bronwen, who was wrapped, or so they deemed, In sleep so deep it would not let her free,â She with her infant, and her people brought From Havod, who had sallied forth at eve With coracles and torches to the lake To falsely lure the fish their lady loved,â Other than these, each soul that breathed at Garth Was pressed into the hall, drawn, knit together, Rapt, overflowing with the generous life That rises sheer above the walls of flesh, Fuses the diverse spirits of a crowd, And of the separate elements creates One God. They brought and set me in the midst, Speechless, not senseless, for my soul with theirs Bore part in the great joy. The flames of Havod, Which earlier in the night had been a terror, Seemed to the faithful crew the tide of war Had left at Garth, to burnâour chieftain nearâ In awful jubilation. So they watched That night; with morning, other light arose. In that same hour, when, stretched beneath the pines, The fiery globe approached me, and revealed As in a magic crystal that which past Without the sphere of sense,âin that same hour, Eurien returning crowned with the sad crown Of victory where cypress hides the bays, Wandered in slow-paced restlessness around The tents and woven branches which shut in His followers' hard-earned sleep. The day was won, But there were weeks of days, and months of weeks, And years of months, wherein the strife renewed, Might still make red the hands of men, and dim The eyes of women. Eurien thought on this, Watching that night beside the turbid waters Of the blue stream where he had called a halt, That light of day might shine upon the banners, And gild the pride of his return to Garth. Then upon Eurien's steel-blue eyes, keen eyes That saw both near and far, and now were strained Haply to catch some lated spark at Garth,â There gleamed a sudden, fitful blaze, a tongue Of flame which seemed by turns to lap the smoke New-risen, and to fall back quenched within it. A serpent's sting in entering at his flesh Had wrought not so on Eurien as this gleam Which pierced his eyes, empurpling them with fire Of sudden wrath, as in his brain it lodged Its sure, swift message. Havod and not Garth, The treasure-house, nay, God of love, not Garth! Sweet saints, and virgin mother, to whose heart The sighs of sleeping innocence are dear, Our chief has vowed rich tribute to your shrines, Loth to have debts to love that owns no name. His soldier's eye had measured space and bearings, Not Garth, sweet Garth, filled full from floor to roof With infant's breath, but dead, forsaken Havod Passes from off the earth in fiery change. As Eurien calls the watch to sound reveillÃ©, And hail the sleepers forth to arms and horse, His spirit kindles with the rage of battle, And only half-slaked thirst of dear revenge. Out of the narrow jaws of Aber-Glaslyn, Rounding the shadowy base of Moel-Hebog, They pour, a rushing stream, a travelling cloud, Hushing the meeting waters as they pass; And now the hoofs ring hard against the sides Of steep Y-Aran, and the whispering waters Of Colwyn awed and shy as mother's welcome. On through the valley, past the Giant's Head, With Garn before them, and the furrowed sides Of Mynyth-mawr, with, red betwixt the two, The lurid cloud which blots out Careg-Havod. Then set upon its rock, with Moel-Wythfa And Moel-Elio, one on either side, Garth and its lights, awake in silent joy, Breaks into sight, and Eurien's heart is glad, As over rugged ground, at breathless pace, Beneath the smoothly-journeying, tranquil stars, He flies, still flies, and leaves his ancient towers To glide away with all the moving world; Laughing the while within his beard to think That Cymric craft has turned against the Sassenach Who taught it, even as man has trained to guile The hunted beast. Seed has been dropped in byways Upon the path of Eurien, that has rooted In Saxon ears, and borne this burning harvest: Words of false import, which have spoken Havod The storehouse of all treasure due to Garth. So on, rejoicing in his fruitful wiles, He flew, while up aloft to listening Garth The clear, glad echoes of his voice resounded Above the tramp of horse, and told the watchers Of help upon its way to burning Havod. Then panting, straining past the sodden banks Of Llyn-y-Gader, plunging through the stream Which links it with Llyn-Quellen, on they went, And faced with fiery rage the mountain path Which skirts the barren flanks of Mynyth-Mawr. Then down the jagged steep there poured a streamâ A meeting streamâthe plundering Sassenachs Encumbered with their spoil, and with the band Of trembling wretches, stumbling in their bonds. A sudden halt of the down-pouring flood,â A short recoil,âthen a brief, sullen stand, A battle front with back against the rock, The prisoners left to swift unreasoning fear, Flying alike from savage friend and foe. They fled, to lose their way amongst the rocks, Or hide in mountain caves, to wander back In safety with the morning; all but one Whose beauty was her bane: Bronwen the fair,â A dainty morsel which the Saxon churl Who claimed her would not willingly let fall,â Was hedged about, a prisoner in the grasp Of a mailed hand, whose fellow flashed on high A sword that was a-thirst for Cymric blood. She saw no more but swooned, and to the ground Drew the fierce caitiff with her falling weight; Her eyes that closed upon the world beholding For a last vision Eurien's wrathful face Beneath his glittering helm and flame-like hair,â All beautiful and pitiless as death. That face which seemed to Bronwen's reeling sense Awful, as of a judge and not a saviour, Was set against a giant, black-browed Saxon, Whom step by step, and blow by blow, he drave Home to the rocky rampart at his back, When, gathering all his might, our chieftain paused A breathing second, ere with one sheer stroke, One swift, two-handed stroke of his keen lance, He shore him through the heart and pinned him there. The world was shut from Bronwen's sight, but sounds Of clashing arms and trampling feet still struck Slow drowsy chords within her lidless ear. Then Eurien shook his lance from out its sheath Of quivering flesh, which spouting forth a stream Of alien blood, befouled her where she lay Unseen of him,âbut lost to fear as hope. Unseen, albeit he turned as if impelled By some stern spirit of avenging justice, And singled warely from the throng of foes Him who had thought to stain the moon-white shield Of honour which to him was light of life. Then they two fought; the Saxon dog, whose brain Was maddened with his two-fold fires of lust, Leaping at Eurien's throat in fierce despite, Struck at his face as fain to mar the image Bared in proud scorn of battle's worst affronts. In vain he struck; our chieftain's proven brand Received upon its guard that wasteful charge Of currish fury; till with eye as keen As was his sword's fine edge, he seized a moment Of vantage, and up-risen in his stirrups, Dealt down upon the helm of his base foe A hail of blows his arm drove home as straight And strong as hammer strokes, and so unhorsed him, Bleeding with many wounds, to fall back ghastly, A corpse beside the senseless form of Bronwen. Then shutting out this sight from Eurien's eyes, There rose a mighty breast and strong armed hand, Likewise unseen of him the while his gaze Sought a new victim. In that perilous hour Our chieftain's life, whose costliness had grown From noble service in victorious cause, Had perished but for Wythan; he whose lance By foeman's fall that moment had been freed, Now launched it with the swift and fiery force Of menaced love against that steel-clad breast Throbbing with the vain-glorious desire Of cutting off the days so dear to Glyneth. The weapon reached its mark; the minion fell; It struck, but did not pierce; it glanced aside; And entered at a tenderer port than that Whereto it had been sent. A woman's cry, A sudden cry as of a soul sent forth In pain upon the eternal, pathless wild; White arms thrown upwards, then a gasping sob, And silence. Bronwen's crooked race was run. Our chieftain heard the cry, and saw the fair Dead image first between the trampling feet, And gripped his sword yet harder, and fought on; Yet fought not now as Eurien, only fought As some unconscious vessel where the blood Of fighting sires was stored, and could arise, Leap of its own blind motion to his arm, And prompt his hand to give back blow for blow. His some-time wife lay dead before his face, Slain here beneath the smoking walls of Havod; He stopped to ask no question e'en of thought; He knew why she was here; he grasped the even Clue of her life; saw through the smooth subservience Wherewith her spirit ever at the threshold Of lip and eye had met him; felt he never Had reached the shallows of her heart and brain To make them flow with his in one clear current; Then laying round him like a man who seeks To build a monument of his revenge, And so appease the manes of one who goes Unhonoured and unwept the way of doom, She past from out his heart with all her wiles, And left it proud and free as was his life. But soft! a pang more keen than that cold parting Cleaves the firm soul of Eurien; the boy, His son and hers,âhis little five months child,â How came she here without him? Is he gone, He too to join that shadow on its way, He too to glorify her unwept grave? He seeks the babe beside her, as he spurns The ghastly head, stamped with a dying curse, From the white pillow of her arm; then leaps From out the press of the now flying Saxons, Throwing a word to Wythan as he goes: âBe this your charge!â he points to that fair piece Of woman's flesh, then bending to the pommel, He drives his spurs deep in his charger's flanks, And hard against the hill the ringing hoofs And scattered stones proclaim how Eurien rides When Eurien's soul is pressed by love and dole. The Saxons save themselves as save they can, Winding through pathless gulleys down the steep; Turning white, dogged faces when o'ertaken And brought to bay by swifter-footed Cymri; And many a shout of baffled rage, and groan Of life gone forth in anguish of defeat, Wakens the slumbering foxes in their holes, Then falls to sleep among the silent hills. And far, and farther as the minutes pass, The noise of travelling war, and grappling hold Of hoofs that struggle up the mountain's side, Are sundered; till, a lonely, foam-flecked horseman, Eurien draws rein, and lights among the ruins Of blackened Havod,âstill, forlorn of life, The very flames extinct, with half their prey Left undevoured; dark Havod, belching smoke, A labyrinth of dim, encumbered ways, Where a man's erring strength and bootless haste Might well be wrought to madness. Lo, a voice,â Clear, tender, pitiful as is the speech Of angels who would comfort little children Passing the lonely gate of death,âa voice He knew for that which speaking through the cloud On Crib-y-dysgull had redeemed his life, And led him forward as the voice of God. And now it leads him. Eurien hears his name, Then neither hears, sees, knows, or feels aught more Until he grasps his child, his gentle babe; Grasps him with eager hands and tremulous, Untender with excess of tenderness, And chafes his silken cheek, soft mouth, and eyes Closed to the storm, with a wild rain of kisses. Sweet kisses doubled with the grateful tears The warrior scorns to shed; sweet face so drowned Sweet smile of infant peace and child's wise trust Wherewith a babe's bare head, which is of all Unfended things that be, the most defenceless, Is laid in deep content upon a heart Which rocks it with a passion all its own. O love, whose highest proof is still thy patience! Pity that overflows to meet all sorrow! Behold ye now thrown back upon your source, To rise as rise the waters of a fountain, To rise, and spread, and compass widowed Eurien, Holding him glorified within your midst,â No higher, purer light shines from the stars Which look upon this meeting, than the light Now shed upon him through the eyes that feed Their sight with a lost image which no tear Would dare to blur. And Eurien in that moment Knows that his infant's head is safely shrined Upon that heart whereto the harried hare Had fled for refuge, as to some known altar Reared in a chosen temple of high God. And more than this: he knows that that white maid Who loomed so largely through the mist, and this On whose frail limbs the smell and smoke of fire Still linger, is the same brave, earth-clad soul, No fleshless spirit unassailable, But Mona as she was,âthe highest dweller Upon the earth, but still on earth a dweller,â Rapt from their undiscerning, dull, brute gaze, And hidden somewhere in the heart of nature, Till they should hail her with the hearts of men;â Mona, his sister once, his slave, his plaything, Marked for his bride, then mourned for dead, then risen As rise the dead within the hearts that love them, And leading him still living, as the dead Will lead, for ever lead, the hearts that love them, The way of heaven, of glory, and of God. No word to shake the stillness of the night,â The clear, keen, breathless, silent, listening night,â No question seeking answer e'en of thought; She was to him so pure and blest a thing, It had not seemed too strange if angel hands Had caught her where she fell. O spreading arms,â Strong, supple arms, fruited, and many-fingered With autumn leafage,âye that were upraised To Clogwyn Cromlech on that direful eve When Mona's heavy heart and light girl limbs Dropt from the sheer rock's crown, and were received Within you, I, GlÃ¢n-Alarch, even I, Who love her only with an old man's love, Shall watch you when the season's change is swelling The sheaths of coming blossoms, to surprise Some sign of joy beyond your yearly wont, Some flowers that are as flowers of paradise, Some fruit that bursts with promise all divine, To credit you the ministers of heaven. No word betwixt the two when Eurien kneels Prone on the ground her bare white feet make holy, And lays his lips upon the dewy hem That sweeps the earth, and bends his conquering browâ As heavy with its weight of reverent joy, Or humbled by the glory of the image Of Eurien's self as seen in Mona's eyes. The calm, sweet rule of worship held him fast A moment, then there stirred within his heart Familiar voices, tones of love and home, The cumulative tenderness of years; He sought her eyes, he clasped her trembling knees, She was again his sister, no immortal, His lost, his valiant Mona, whose great heart Was ever set to tasks that overbore The feebler flesh. He started to his feet, The brother all alive, the brother's love Quickened by loss and sorrow; in his arms He took her with the child, the little son She brought him from the dead, and folded her Close in a home of refuge whose sure title Lay locked within the past. Then there arose Betwixt the twain a presence which was other Than of the child; a sudden flame of joy Their meeting breath had kindled; quickened fire Of life in every nerve, that seemed to shape them To a new consciousness of being,âa knowledge Within them of a form divine, with power To give eternal gladness. Eye to eye They held each other fast above the head Of sleeping innocence, while beating heart To beating heart answered through that soft bar. A moment still they trembled on the verge, Then lip to lip declined, and plunged their spirits Deep in the fathomless joy of the first kiss This twain had ever kissed as man and woman; A joy as wild as fire, more pure than snow, Unstained, keen, absolute, as flawless light. Thou Earth that art a star among the stars Which make the army of the heavenly King, And art obedient to His sovereign word As is the goodliest servant in His host, Dost thou not burn amid them as a sun, When love, triumphant as the love of these, Leaps into life unquenchable, unborrowed From any sphere, and only born of God? A momentânow I pause to thank Thee, God, That wrath of men still passes like the smoke Which wanes above the cooling stones of Havod, While moments such as these have scope eternalâ A moment and the woman yields her weakness As if it were itself some inmost joy,â The bitter-sweet, shy kernel of this fair, Fresh fruit of life they taste together first,â Yields it and is enclosed, upheld by him Whose arms to herâstrong with a new-born powerâ Are as a god's. Nay, I would pass from hence But cannot forth, and needs must linger still. I, old GlÃ¢n-Alarch, weak, and dead to love, Am caught as in the current of its stream, Am kept as in the valley of its wave; I who love joy, I cannot choose but linger Where joy is rife in hearts so near mine own. Back, back ye tears that come in lieu of words! Mona the dead has waked to blessed life, Mona the wandering ghost has found a home, Mona the waif now lies in joyful prison Of Eurien's arms. She, as an outcast lonely, Has grown to be a virgin mother, loved Of him who owns the service of all hearts; She who went forth unknown has been revealed; She for whose gentle life a pit was digged Has come again with, on her mortal face, The lingering glory of the blessed dead! Now costly moment of recovered right, And fruited joy by sorrow perfected, Pass from my page as from the book of Time: Your memory is blent with that high hope And larger triumph of victorious arms Which makes my latest wine of life the best, And, like a fragrant flower dropped in the cup, Will savour all the draught unto the end! So but a moment of our time, the twain Had met and mixed their being, and I know not And think they knew not justly, if a word Had spoken been betwixt them, when the maiden Drew the light shape that had so lately parted The flames in fearless quest of Eurien's son From Eurien's arms; and, filled with thoughts of pity For the dead woman, slain as she had seen her, And lying as she knew beneath her feet In dire exchange of place, she from her bosom Took the still sleeping babe, and trembling all With the sweet tumult of her own young passion And the yet sweeter dread of his, she laid himâ A bulwark to embay the rising tempestâ Safe on his father's outstretched handsâand left him. She turned and set her gleaming face and feet Towards Garth; then stood a moment on the brow Of Havod bryn; there paused, and turned again With wafting hand which signed for him to follow, Keeping that space betwixt them; then she sunk From off the hill, and took a way as trackless Amongst the cloven rocks, the broom and heather, As that of birds which skim the autumn clouds. And Eurien followed, holding by the rein His wearied steed, and close upon his heart The child whose precious weight was all too light To still its beating; and she led him on, Away from that dark scene of blood and death, Whence Wythan bore the ruined form of Bronwen To lay within her ruined walls of Havod. So in the radiant twilight of the stars He followed, nothing doubting, those sure feet Which led him down the steep and up the slope, Andâwhere it beamed upon him from the dusk Field of the wintry gorseâher face, which shone White as the lily's shine when all less pure Is swallowed of the night. So on and on Until above the hills the morning broke, And Garth, the highest house upon the hills, Was touched with sudden glory, which they pressed Onwards to reach. Then, 'neath the waning stars And rising sun we met,âthose three returning In unattended triumph, with the signs Of deadly rage of battle, and of fire On clothes and hair,âand we, Modwyth and I, The old dumb Bard, and Methuen with the harp, The friend of olden days who shared my silence,â Met on the way we trod in restless anguish In search of Bronwen and the babe. Oh, joy, That dared not cry aloud for death was near! I think I too had died that hour, nor lingered To see the sun of Eurien and of Wales Risen and shining, shining through the clouds, Kindling anew the embers of my life, If in that hour my joy that was forbid The common speech of men had found no relic, No poor remainder of the song that used In olden days to burst from my full heart And ease it of its rapture or its pain. I seized my harp, and from its triple strings Wrung forth an answer to my fourfold joy. The long-imprisoned silent soul of music Trembled beneath the fury of my quest, Yet bravely in the hearing of the hills Gave forth its witness. It was all too weak, The burthen laid upon its chords too great; My heart leapt up within me, and fled forth Breaking the seal of silence on my lips, And high above the heads of all the hills I lifted up my voice, and to the sun New-risen in the heaven, and to the stars That fell before his face, I told my tale: The wicked had not triumphed: I might sing God was not overthrown: and so I sung: Break, break, O daybeams, and kindle our beacon-hills! Vault o'er our valleys and meet our wild waves; Foam of the breaker, and flash of our mountain-rills, Bear our high tidings o'er rocks and through caves. Water the roots of our hills out of sight, O rills, Deepen their hold on the heart of the earth; While ye stand fast looking up to the light, O hills, Sons strong to guard you shall press to the birth. Pure are our springs as they fresh from their fountains burst, Only the waters of Severn are red; None of our Cymri will waken in bonds accurst,â None but the eagle and vulture are fled. Where is the eagle that rose when the morning first Called to him? Gone to that river so red, Dipping his gory wing, quelling his raging thirst, Hot from his feast on the Sassenach dead. Deep lies the earth on the breasts of our fallen ones, Hidden from scorn and the sight of our eyes, Keeping still watch on the banks where the river runs, Dumbly rebuking the voice of our sighs. Safe thou, our Head, in the crown of thy martyrdom Proud, for the âbleeding heartâ fails not, nor faints; Live thou our witness and sign for all days to come,â Teudric the saint, and avenger of saints! Live thou our Head where the light of the Holy One Falls on the face we behold from afar; Bound by thy rule as the spheres by the blessed sun, Led through the night of our doom by thy star. Break, break, O daybeams, and kindle our beacon-hills, Vault o'er our valleys and meet our wild waves; Foam of the breaker, and flicker of mountain-rills, Bear our young hope over rocks and through caves. Water the roots of our hills day and night, O rills, Strengthen them, nourish and sweeten the ground, While ye stand fast looking up to the light, O hills, Sons hero-hearted will ring ye around. Hail to thee, Eurien! Lift up thine eagle-head, Pure to the daybeams the gold of thy crest,â Pure as the Colwyn that flows to its marriage-bed, Pure as the blossom that sleeps on thy breast. Hail to thee, virgin,âwhite champion of innocence,â Armed by the dews of the night as you came, Cleaving the deadly reek, bearing our treasure thence, Giving the lie to the false tongues of flame. Hail to ye, man, woman, child,âthe elected three Charged with God's lightnings of love and of death; Three to the sword, to the pit, and the flame were ye,â One to our hope, and our fierier faith! Teudric to stand for us, shine for us day and night Sheer in God's face with our wrongs and our woes, Ye for the rod of His hand, in his guiding light Breaking the backs of our pitiless foes. Strong blows a breath as the wind on that midmost sea Bearing the tall ships that tremble and groan, Sweeping them onward as now that wind sweepeth me, Driving them forth on a course not their own;â Strong blows the breath and it taketh me, lifteth me Upward and onward, I struggle in vain,â Taketh me, showeth me what mine eyes die to see,â Teareth forth words from the heart of my pain. Not by the tongues of the earth shall the victory Claimed be for us when the last field is won; Not by the watchers below shall the triumph be Laid to our door when the long day is done:â Fold not the flag, from the sheath pluck the weapon free, Edge it,âas sheath ye will want it no more; Stand up like men, ay, though God were not there to see,â Strike for the right as the waves for the shore. Strike for the right though the wrong shall ride over you, Fall, if ye fall, with the sword in your hand; So shall your blood and your tears be a morning dew Worthy to blend with the life of the land! So shall ye strengthen your souls for the latter spring, Pouring them out as the cloud pours the rain,â Giving them back for the heart of the earth to bring Nearer to God as a fountain again. Lost though ye be to all other than God alone, Never your shape to His eye shall grow dim, Never His ear from the harmony lose the tone Taught the sad secret of music by Him. So in the far time, when spoiler and spoiled shall stand One in the face and the front of the world, Sudden a cry from the deep shall surprise the land Low in the dust when oppression is hurled. So in the far time when spoiler and spoiled shall be One as the blood mixed in war and in peace, Sweetening their rough wine of song shall our threnody Steal through the world to its music's increase. So in the far time when spoiler and spoiled forlorn Watch by the altars whose light burneth dim, We with the younger heart left to earth's earlier born Still in the darkness shall lift up the hymn, Pour out the prayer and the praise that abide in us Still when the stars in their courses are mute; Words with a meaning forgotten that hide in us,â Breath as of God that still lives in His flute; Bow in our worshipful need to the God that lies Lost in the wilds and the wastes of the earth, Till with a rush as of flame every soul shall rise One to the Godhead that gave it its birth. Great is the will of the Highest, and great are we, Ripening in darkness as seed in the womb, Great is the God of our trust, and His children we, Treading to music the dark way of doom. THE END.</field>
