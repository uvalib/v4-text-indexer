Eadem Latine. Non oculis ego te, clarissime Gogie, vidi, Gogie natalis gloria magna soli: Sed tua bella tamen lustraui epigrammata, quæ? Acquent Chauceri scripta deserta senis. Vidi &amp; Signidici veneranda poæmata Vatis, Sunt in maternos quæ tibi versa sonos. Omnia quæ pulchrè, Musis? fauentibus ipse Scripsisti, Vatum munere digna sacro. To the right Honorable Sir William Cecill Knighte, principall Secretary to the Queenes highesse, &amp; Maister of her Maiesties Courte of Wardes and Liuereyes. The fyrst Booke of Pallingen, entituled Aries. My minde with fury fierce inflamd of late I know not how, Doth burne Parnasus hylles to see, adournd wyth Laurell bow, The Camps so cleare of Castaly, where Muses sweete do sing: The towne Cyrrha doth me delight, and trees that euer spring. What darknesse oh shall I now flie? to me appeareth playne The blissefull beames of Eous bright, the day returnes agayne. O darknesse fade thy way from hence, hyde thou thy selfe in hell. The loue of Muse and hie Iehoue, doth both within me dwell. And vertue doth not labour feare, the way though hard it be, O Phebus father Poets helpe, disclose the doubtes to me, With Aganippes holsome fode, replenish thou my dayes: Thy temple eke to come vnto, do thou direct my wayes. Defend me from the common sorte, that seeke me to disprayse. Not worse vnlikde now shall I be, if that thou wylt me blesse, That I thy priest vnknowne and new, my selfe to labour dresse. Thou liftest men from base estate, to honours them to call, Without thy grace, the wit of man, would perish sone and fall: His voyce and al would waxe full horce nothing would swetely sound, All swete and pleasaunt melody, would fal vnto the ground. And if thou wilte me fauour nowe, I wyll ascend the Skies, And there thy hie and Godly workes contemplate with mine eyes. Oh fauour me, thou Phebus hie, take thou from ground away: Thy Poet prostrate here on earth, if that by fates I may. And you (O Nimphes) of Castaly, if wyth vnfayned harte I haue approcht your learned dores, if riottes fylthy arte Could not w?draw my youthful yeares, from honoring of your name, Ne fylthy lust of beastlinesse coulde euer me defame: Then let my fame go flye abrode, least that vnworthyly, I shal be after thought to liue, and so my name shal dye. For hope of glory and renowne, a man for to obtayne, Hath caused men in vertuousnesse to take both care and payne. And thou O famous worthy Prince that Hercule hast to name, Amongs the doughty Italian Dukes, of most renowned fame. And of the hie Estensian bloud, the chiefe illuster floure: Whom Pallas in Parnasus caues, hath nourisht euery houre, Whome Muses nine wyth sacred milke from tender yeres haue fed, Whereby a fame they hope to haue that neuer shall be deade: Of Cyrrha eke the Laurell tree, shall spring they trust agayne, Though Mars doth let in spite of them, and seeketh to retayne Your noble heart into his tentes by al the meanes he may: In tents where honour you shal haue that neuer shall decay, Wheras your armes as right requires shall richly decked be With triumphes due to such a Prince of lusty Laurell tree. Drawe nere and wyth a ioyful face thy Poete loke vpon, Willing to treade vnproued pathes that haue not yet bene gone. And shewe thy fauour to a wight that nowe abashed is: So may Ferrarra see thee long in perfect ioy and blis, Till after this thy ioyfull life, a long and happy time, Departing from the earth thou shalt the starry heauen clime. And if my Fatal yeares be long, in time shal come the day, When as your grace and worthy dedes I shal at large display, When Indie aye with Tartesse brinkes thy name shall cause to sound: Thy fame shall flye in euery place of Hiperbores ground. In vtter partes of Africke to, you shall be knowen by me: Then I wyth greater rage of Muse, encouraged shall be, And shal declare vnto al men, how that you do embrace Iustice, and eke what Godlinesse and fayth is in your grace, What counsayle doth in you abound, what valeant worthy powre, How liberall with gentlenesse, you are at euery howre: By me shall also wonder much, the world in euery place, To see what wyt and manners mylde, consisteth in your grace. But now the things that I you giue, receiue wyth gentle harte, And take my present doing here, a while as in good parte. My minde desyreth sore to wryte of much and diuers things, And not alwayes to stay at one, but as the sprite me brings I go now here, now there I swimme amid the waters deepe, Sometime I tosse the boistrous waues sometyme to shore I creepe. And though sometimes by reasons rule I shall assay to finde, The secret wayes by nature hyd, and bring them vnto minde: Those things yet will I follow most, whereby a profyt shall Aryse, and adde a holy life, to men that be mortal. A life alas now banisht cleane, if I the truth may say In this our age, than which a worse was neuer seene the day. Such things I say, that shall expel the vices of the minde: A thing that more the Muses fyttes, than this I can not finde. This makes a man for to be sound, of witte both prompt and fine, Although by nature he be dull, and do no whitte decline Ungodly, and neglecting right, that horedome doth not spare, Or on whome earthly auarice, hath caused for to care, Or he whome enuy in his hearte, doth euermore possesse, Unconstant, or a lying man, or takes in drinke excesse, In fine what euer vice he hath, by this he may forsake, The hurtful harmes of peruerse mind, a Godly life to take. This worthy men doth cause to be, and fyt for honours hie: which to themselues, their house, and realme can councel prudently, And vnto doubtful things they can bring present remedy. So much the face of beauty fayre, ought not estemed to be, The pleasaunt eyes with shining locks, eche parte of royall blee, As maners wel composed, and a pure and honest minde, Where vertue beares so great a stroke that vice is harde to finde. Doth not the righteous man or he, that vertues much doth loue, Liue al in myrth, and hopes for helpe of only God aboue? He nothing cares wh? whispring wordes be closely spoke in eare, When iudge, or King, doth for him cal his heart doth nothing feare. Contrarywise the wicked man, defamed feares to be, And when the lightnings th?der rores, then gilty trembleth he. If men doe chaunce in eares to rounde, or whisper when they walke, Alas then cries he to himselfe, of me these men do talke, What shal I do? the Iudge or King doth cal, and shall I goe, Or rather flie the perils great of wretched life? now loe, By fyxed law of GOD doth feare the wicked men torment, And though sometime the euil man to myrth doth seeme as bent, As Strongilos amyd the seas, yet doth he boyle within, Or Etna when his flaming dartes, Pyrackmon doth begin. But were it better to declare, with thousand shippes assaylde The cursed chaunce of Pergamus that folishly bewaylde The periurde chaunce of Sinons deede? or else Ogiges towne, Which by the cruel chaunce of warre, was raced cleane adowne? Or shal I prayse, as Poetes wont, some man wyth forging lyes? And iudge a colour fayre to be, contrary to mine eyes? Or were it better here to fayne, how Dedalus did flie, The woful hap of Icarus that fell out of the Skie? The bodies oft transfourmed aye, of Gods and eke of men: And so delude the ydle eares, with trifies of my pen? Or had I better to declare the wanton toyes of youth, And slaunder Gods wyth prophane acts which is a greater ruth? For what do these our frantick heads now feare at any houre? The Gods (we say) with lecherous luste, both boyes and maydes defloure. A hore in heauens hie to be, a lechoure to they say: O shame, is this a Godlinesse, or right to vse such way? Are these the thankes we owe to God? be these our odoures swete? Be these the duties that we owe, or prayses for him meete? What thing will now the witte of man forbeare to fayne or lye: By meanes whereof they may obtayne in sinne a liberty? Of writers vayne both leud and yll, O rude vnruly route, You nede to take Elleborus to pourge your humours out. To you I speake that others harme whole tongs do spare no man: If lightning should you all consume, what maruell were it than? Shew me the cause both night and day, why do you take such payne? Is it but only for your selues? why then no prayse you gayne, For he that only priuate wealth regardeth alwayes still, And laughes to scorne an others harme whilste he enioyes his will. A sauage beast by right desert, deserueth calde to be: And not a man for to be namde, for so to write ought we, That men may get some good thereby, and not complaine to spend: Their times in trifling trickes &amp; toyes that haue no certaine end. And fyrst ought to be knowen that we, do good in three deuide: In pleasure and vtilitie, and honesty chiefe beside. Some one of these or greater parte, may Poets alway vse: So that the bondes of honesty, to breake they shall refuse. But O what titles and what crowne, did he deserue to haue, Which things not only vaine &amp; nought good fruite that neuer gaue, But wrot such things as might corrupt the life of any man, And make him worser ten to one, than when he first began? He left behinde him monuments, of wanton wicked wayes: And left such foolish doting things, to men of latter dayes. O Lord how much doth wanton words to wicked life entice And with a feruent poyson great, doth draw men vnto vice. From eares a wanton wicked voice, dare pearce the secrete thought. And vnto mischiefe moue thereby, the members bent to nought. A noble man such things delight, (some man perhaps wyll say:) Who in his house a lusty route doth kepe in rich aray, Whome for to feare, excessiue goods compels a man thereto, With any parte of worthy wyt who neuer had to do. What then may these be suffred thoe, or praysd, bycause they please The rich, or else the noble men that alwayes liue in ease? Not so, for what a sorte there be of twolegd Asses clothed In Golde and Silke, and Purple fayre to al men is not shewed. There be, there be ful many now, whome Pearls haue puft with pride, And whome the Asians haue beset with Silke on euery syde, Whose fingers fayre with rings of gold be dasht and deckt about, With precious stones &amp; pearles of price that India sendeth out. Those men a man would almost swear, that Plato they excell, Or Socrates who (Phæbus iudge) of wisdome bare the bell. And yet these Princely paynted walles do nought wythin contayne, A blather ful implete with winde they may be termed playne. Where Fortune fawnes, there pleasure springs and pleasure bringeth folly: And so the light of reasons rule is darkned vtterly, Whereby it happes that seldome wyse, these children chaunce to be. To suffer payne for vertues sake, who wil, if so be he Haue no rewarde? rewarde who sekes, but he whome nede constraynes? The rich man followes ioyful things, and liueth void of paynes, He hates the prycking thorny wayes, the clyffes both sharp and sowre, By which we do assay to clime, to Lady learnings towre. I can not stay my selfe as now, when anger c?mes vpon, But needes I must defye both verse, and Poets al as one, When boyes we see decline to nought, whome maisters do embewe, With verses filthy to be namde, which most they should eschew. Their first possessed shamefastnesse, to see them cleane forsake: And eke how apt and prone they be a noughty way to take, And foster mischiefe so in youth, that he may alwayes dwell In them, whereby they may prepare in age a way to hell. But yet it doth me good to see, how hoping al for praise, They get themselues immortall shame, that neuer more decayes. For who wil iudge them voyd of vice, or that they liude not so, As they themselues did giue precepts to others for to go? The talke it selfe doth wel declare, the nature of the minde, And euery man doth moste frequent things propre to his kinde. Of Oxen, rake, and culter sharpe the plowmans tong doth walke, Of Sayle and Cable, Mast and Ore, is all the Seamans talke. Of Horses, harnesse, Speare &amp; Shielde, the Captayne styl wil boste: So bawdy mates of bawdy things, their tongs do clatter moste. I warne you syrs aboue the rest, of youth that takes the cure, Whose parte it is the tender mindes of boyes for to allure, To vertue and to Godlinesse, like waxe do them prepare, Hate you the wicked workes of those, for greater matters care. Reade not such things as are but vayne vnworthy to be tolde: But teach the worthy histories of auncient fathers olde. Herein let children nouseled be, let these be borne away: Hereof may spring a Godly fruite, direct their life that may. They shew what things we folow shuld and what we should reiect: And fables al among the rest we may not wel neglect. For oftentimes a Comody, may holesome doctrine bring: And monish men by pleasant wordes, to leaue some noughty thing. There be I graunt some Poets workes not altogither vayne, Which with a plesaunt sugred style, procede from sobre brayne. These things do helpe, and voyd of vic these workes do profit much: In youth bring vp your scholers wyth none other foode but such. And when their yong and tender age they once haue passed out: Then may they safely voyd of harm, go range the fieldes about, And gather floures where they list, for daunger is away. But now a while for to discusse, I thinke it best assay, Of which of these is nedefull most, or moste to be estemed: The man that good and honest is, or he that well is learned. The good or else the learned man, of two which is the best: Learning is hie, bec?mes the meke, and doth the proude infest. It doth refuse the belly gods, and such as sleepe hath trainde: Without long time and labour great, it wyll not be obtainde. This Citie rules and moueth Mars, and this can warres refell: It sheweth the earth and goodly starres and sicknesse doth expell. Thys teacheth figures faire to frame, of sundry sorte and kinde: This teacheth vs to number well, and musicke calles to minde. This doth ascende the heauens and bring hidden things to light: No perfit man without this same, may called be of right. Unlike to beastes and like to gods, this causeth vs to be: Sometime and yet of little price, his vertue lost we see. As oft as with the dregges of vice, defylde he doth put on: Deformed hewe amid the durce, as doth the Iasper stone. Or as the Sunne behinde the cloude, or shadowe of the Moone: Ne is it onely vile in sight, but hurtfull very soone. For if a wicked man it haue, then may it be comparde: Unto a frentyke foole that hath a sworde wythout regarde. Whereby hee many doth destroy, and runneth more astray: But he that voide of harme and hurte, to liue doth well assay. Obseruing well the law of God, and of the hygher powre: And synne doth flye as open throte, of dragon to deuoure. The shepe, the moyle or horses kept, whose office is to see: Though he be one, if learning lacke, estemde he ought to bee. Such one I say no man nor God, can euer well despise: But he that vertue doth enuie, at least that is not wise. For who but such wyll not hym loue, and worthily commende: That feareth God and righteousnes, obserueth to hys ende. Whom golde can neuer ouercome, who willeth no mans wrong: Who helpes the poores afflicted case, who flyeth the naughty throng. He feedes the humble and the meke yll tongues hee doth reiect: No man to hurt he doth reioice, but rather to protect. And that which is the worthyest praise at euery time he can: In euery thing a modestye, vse, happy is that man. More happy yet I doe him iudge, that doth in both excell: Who that is good and learned to, a crowne deserueth well. For other men he farre exceedes, as golde doth copper passe: And as the flaming Piropus, excelles the duskey glasse. And seldome synne thou shalt discerne, a man of learned fame: At least not much, vnto the rude, there is no heede of shame. But headlong rushe they into vice, which they forbidden bee: And holy lawes be laught to scorne, by foolishe fonde decree. Lyke as the blinde cannot beware, but fal in ditches deepe: As men amid the darke be hurt, when Proserpine doth sleepe. So minde of man, which is but blinde take learning once away: In euery vice it doth not doubt to fall and runne astray. Except it be comprest by feare, of paine that may ensue: No things but those that pleasaunt bee, it iudgeth right or true Yet many times it may be sene, that nature doth supply: The maisters roume and giueth grace, in youth abundantly. Whereby that schoole did neuer teache, by grace they may obtaine: What letteth such to leade a life, as vertue teacheth plaine. The greater thankes be due to him, for euermore to giue: Whose booke doth shew a Methode true declaring how to liue. O famous Gods of hie renoume, which rule the forked hyll: To whom my yeares I alwayes gaue, and dedicate them styll. If that such waighty things a wretche, may safely you desire: In this my worke I take in hande, your aide I now require. Let not dishonour me deface, nor in his blasing rage: Let limping Uulcan me destroye, at any time or age. And thus an ende the ramme that kepes the entraunce of our doore: Doth leaue his place vnto the bull, that hasteth here afore. The booke approching next at hande, doth will mee to haue done: In hast and biddes nie finishe now, that I of late begonne. The Seconde booke entituled Taurus. Long time y? hast thee rested well, my boate in pleasant baye: Now time vs biddes to hoyse vp sailes and ancour vp to way. The washing wynter now is fledde, the hoary snowes be gon: From downe the hylles they fast distill, that once they fell vpon. The earth againe doth florishe greene, the trees repaire their spring: With pleasaunt notes the Nitingale, beginneth new to sing. With flowers fresh their heads be deckt the Fairies daunce in fielde: And wanton songes in mossye dennes, the Drids and Satirs yelde. The wynged Cupide fast doth cast, his dartes of golde yframed: And lusty youth with pleasaunt heate, hath feruently inflamed. Now may we safely wander out, amid the waters plaine: The floudes be calme y? westerne wynde is present here againe. O foole why art thou now afraide, the ayre is fayre and bright: And Atlas daughters risyng vp, perswade thy course of right. For ydlenesse what kynde of praise can happen vnto thee: To slouthfulnesse no good rewarde, may well ascribed bee. Lyft vp thy heart and corage eke, be bolde and of good chere: For fortune most doth fauour those, that all things least doe feare. To fearefull folkes at any time, shee triumphe hath denaide: But as I gesse the monsters teeth, doth make thee sore afraide. Great shame it is that vertue shoulde, for monsters hyde their face: Go to therefore leaue of thy lettes, and walke the depth apace. The kyng and Lord and mighty power, that rules the worlde so fast: Who wyth a beck the golden starres, shall gouerne whilste they last. Who made the earth inhabited wyth beastes of sundry sight: And diuers fishe within the sea, to draw their vitall sprite. Least destitute of dwellers be, those elements they shoulde: And onely man among the rest, discerne he reason woulde. And vnto him he graunted speache, where beastes be dumme of sounde: Declining downe their bodies great, doe lycke the massey grounde. With reason he hath vnder brought, the strongest beastes of might: The Lion fierce, the Tygre swift, alone hath put to flight. The serpents though their bodies foule wyth poyson doe abounde: Doe stande in awe and feare him to, when that they heare hys sounde. The m?struous mole y? thurlpole great, of mighty forme and strength: In Occean sea doth giue him place, when he doth walke at length. Take him away what were the earth? a place wyth bryers growne: And would bring forth no kinde of corne vntilde or els vnsowne. Hee cities built and ordned lawes. wherby they ruled bee: Wyth temples trymmed for their state, the Gods adourned hee. Full many artes he searched forth, and instruments he founde: Which like the lightning flashe &amp; flame, and lyke the thunders sounde. Wherein the fier fast inclosde, inforceth all hee may: Out of hys mouth to rumble oute, the pellet farre away. Whereby the Towers hye be bette, and walles of euery towne: Hys strength not able to abide come topsy turuey downe. And he that heareth farre away, the bouncing of these blowes: With dreadfull noyse y? th?der thumpes as present there he trowes. Unhappy had you bene O Gods, if in Phlegreus grounde: Wheras with giantes huge you fought such weapons had bene founde. He founde out shippes whereby a man, to passe the seas may knowe: And wander farre whereas he list, if wynde at wyll doe blowe. In places farre abrode and nie, to Tytan in the East: And where the S?ne doth slip sometime and fall vnder the west. And in the North whereas the Beare, her colour cleare doth giue: And in the other part againe, where men there be that liue. Whose feete contrary quite to ours, doe alwayes vse to treade: And lyke to fall their heeles aloft, doe downewarde hang theire head, And though he doe excell in witte, and vigour of the minde: So much that well he may be thought to come of God hys kinde. Yet knoweth he not nor seekes to know, a thyng to badde to tell: How for to liue, what wayes to flye, or what to follow well. O mortall brestes where darknes blinde doth euermore abounde: And eke O mindes where foolishnesse, may alwayes well be founde, By wicked wayes they runne astray, and fewe alas doe knowe: Which way their iourney well to take or where in safe to rowe. Whereby the chiefe and happiest lyfe, in time they may obtaine: The knotty science of the lawes, will neuer shewe it plaine. Nor he that can in medicine skyll, in eloquence or grammer: But onely wysedome must the waye detect, the chiefe defender. Of man and ruler of hys life, which if the Lorde mee giue: And if the systers three me let, vntill my time to liue. What kinde of thing is blessed lyfe, I wyll my selfe entreate: And how it may be got although, it be a labour great. The greatest part of men doe thinke, felicitie to stande: In purses puffed vp with pens, and so much golde in hande. To haue as in the Lidius streames, among the sande doth growe: Or else as much as Tagus vp, continually doth throwe. To haue so many acres of good grounde and pastors plaine: As he hath haires vnto hys head, of men a bushing traine. Of beastes so huge a droue to haue, as Polyphemus not: At any time did foster vp, amid the pleasaunt plot. Of Sycyly as neuer had the shepeheard Aristeus: As neuer toke away by force, the man that hyght Tyrinthus. Wyth orchardes fayre as euer had, Alcinous the King: And as the systers fayre did holde, by force of cruell sting. Of dragon vgly to beholde, for to possesse alone: Wyth houses hye adourned faire, wyth crust of Marble stone. These are the things that euery man, doth now a dayes desire: Which nature carefull for her sonne, doth instantly require. With earnest prayer to the Gods, these things who doth possesse: The common sort beleues he liues, in perfect blessednesse. What Hiders great in flowers lurke, the blockheads doe not knowe: Ne yet how many pricking thornes among the Roses growe. For needes he must no remedy, that riches wyll obtaine: Both night and day be vexed sore, wyth cares and cruell paine. His lucke vncertaine euery houre, now thys, now that he wayeth, No sooner sittes he downe to meate, but auarice hym frayeth. No meates almost doe please his mouth he hasteth to forsake: The table yet vnsatisfyde, for filthy lucre sake. And little rest the wretched soule, doth take at any night: Sometimes on side, sometimes on face, sometimes he turnes vpright. He tosseth rounde about the bed, like as the waighty stone: That Sysyphus continually, doth tosse and turne alone. What he hath done the day before, he muttereth in hys minde: And what the next day he may doe, he museth for to finde. Beholde (sayth he) my cattaile dyes, to morowe if I may: Some fother I shall seeke to get, O cursed wynters day. How much this cold hath hurt mi beasts full sore am I deluded: My bayly and my shepeherd eke, haue both me foule misused. My folde the wolues, O wofull chaunce, alas haue broken in: And now my cattell to destroy, the souldyer doth begin. He hath destroide my tenements, by flame consumed quite: My corne and now my vineyarde to, he scorcheth downe a right. My detter fledde from hence away, my money with him gone: No fayth there is that feareth God, I thinke there be not one. The worlde is naught but great disceit O Lorde he was estemde: An honest faithfull man and true but all is not as it semde. That rule is not to be obserude: to trust a man by face: But wherefore shoulde I nowe lament my shippe returnes a pace. And home she bringes I leape for ioy, such wares as wyll awaye: Both pepper spice and franckincense, wyth sylke and amber aye. With clothes that Sydon sendeth forthe and wares of diuers kinde: Which thorow y? waues of surging seas she bringeth forth of Inde. Whom if the great Symplegades, had chaunste to burst a sunder: Or Scilla with the Caphare rocke, the seas had suncke her vnder. Then should I fyll my house alas wyth great complaynt and cryes: The teares would ouerflow my breast, that issued from my eyes. I wyll no money lack I trowe, tyll lyfe beginne to starte, Corne beares to lowe a price what then of oyles I make my marte. I must go delue I must go sowe, and harrow well my corne: I must go builde and see my vines, well trimmed cut and shorne. This wyll I bye this will I sell, I wyll receiue and paye: My dettes no otherwise thys wretche, is tost then ball in playe. The multitude beholding hye, is vsed to be cast: Now here now there among the croude is driuen very fast. Some one doth strike it wyth his h?des, some other wyth hys feete: In ioye in griefe in feare and hope so doth he alwayes fleete. As seas he wont when windes do blowe an Ixion is he iust: Who wyth a cloud as hath bene tolde, perfourming filthy lust. Begat a sonne of double fourme wherfore he then was iudged, Of gods vpon a snaky wheele, for euer to be tourned. For what is riches but a thing, which aptest we may like: Unto a cloude which Boreas if descending happe to strike. Thou shalt beholde wherof it came, to smoke resolued than: Of riches monsters he begot, that haue the face of man. Then outward face of welthy man: what thing doth more excell? But when the course of all his life, we once haue marked well. We shall beholde the hinder partes, to differ farre away: From those that we did first discerne, whome fortune wythout stay, Doth tourne about vpon hir wheele, the carkes and cares be snakes, Which alwayes gripe &amp; gnaw his heart wyth sorrowes that he takes. The riche man either knowes or not, what goodes he doth possesse: If not what helpe they then thereby no good ne yet distresse. He doth receiue but as a man, that riches is without: If he doe knowe he either loues, or loues them not no doubt. If he them hate, why keepes he them, what ioy takes he thereby: Such as who drinks the iuice of grapes and wyne doth cleane defye. If he them loue he them regardes, and seketh to defende: Them, and to kepe the sorrowes much, and labours till his ende. It doth him much vnquiet when, He thinketh for to see: Some harme approching to hys welth, and vexed most is he. When any part therof by losse doth scape out of hys hande: As many times for to befall, by needefull rule doth stande. When nothing long in state abides, thou shalt beholde and see: So many harmes as euer seene, in hast at hand to be. When all is done how much the more of goodes he doth possesse: So much the more of carke and care, shall euer him oppresse. What shall I here declare or shewe, the daungers incident: That he doth passe by seas and land, his liuing to augment. From theues by land fr? theues by seas fall oft he flyeth fast: And yet for all the wyles he hath, he taken is at last. And oft his bowels doe become, a pray vnto the wolfe: Or Fishes fowle do him deuoure, vp swallowed in the golfe. And often he whom worldly wealth, had moued to be bolde: Is forced vnder his maysters yoke, his captiues neck to holde. At home at boorde ne yet in bed, he cannot safely be: But poyson strong they wil him giue, whome least mistrusteth he. Or else the wicked handes of some, vnthrifty seruaunt wyll: In bed a slepe and snorting fast, hym quickly sley and kyll. As fattest beastes in sacrifice, be soonest euer slayne: And as the worthiest tree is first, depriued of his grayne. And as the grape is first destroyde, that sweetest is of tast: With flyes and bees and other wormes that always them do wast. So he whome nature most hath lent, is alwayes most intrapt: And euermore in daungers great, is readiest to be clapt. Note well the crafty wit and head, of Dionise the King: Behold good man and art thou blessed, what else thou lackst nothing. Thou lackst no meat y? lackst no drinke, thou lackst no pleasaunt boyes: Thou lackst no scepter nor no crowne, thou wantest no wished ioyes. With glistering gold &amp; precious stones, beholde thou doest abounde: A sword but loe hangs ouer thy head, that will the wretch confound. With enuy richesse eft be vext, all things of good estate: Doth malice harme and happye things it euermore doth hate. So deare (O misers) do you seeke, of golde the wicked mine: Wherby your harts may alwaies prick the sisters Palestine. And soner downe descend the pit, of ghastly Plutoes raigne: Was not the giftes that Bacchus gaue, of golde to Mydas gaine. Of all men laught to scorne by right, to whom thou Phebus much, An angred gauest an Asses eares, all things quoth Myde I tutch. Be golde I wyshe and by and by, he asked his fatall ende: For downe his gredy griping guttes, no meate coulde then discende. Such fortune hast thou sparing wretch the more thou hast of goodes: The more thou lackste as Tantalus, doth thirst among the floudes, If thou mighst all things free obtaine, thou wouldst thy selfe require: Wouldst thou but take y? should suffyce excesse or else desire. This one doth hurte the other meane, all men may soone obtaine: For nature with a little thing, contented doth remaine: Except that headlong falne to vice, it doth repugne againe. The chiefest fruites of seas and woode, to riche mens boardes be brought: There lacks no Hare no goat nor Hart no Kid no Bore nor ought. Amongst the flocke of flittering foules, the Throstell fatte and rounde: The Partrige, Colmouse, nor y? birdes, that bredes in Colchis grounde. With Capons great &amp; mighty Doues, and Turbots in be brought: The Lopster, Lamprey &amp; the Shrimpe, and Mugil fat is caught. The fishe that toke his name of golde, the chopping Oyster newe: Which Cizicus doth foster vp, amid his seas so blewe. Wyth many moe that semeth harde, in verse for to declare: And wines y? may wyth falerne fieldes, and Nectare sweete compare. But now I aske and will this wretche, all this himselfe deuoure: I thinke not so for if he woulde, it semes not in his power. And if he might his belly sure would burst a sonder thoe: And swolne to tombe with roring route him following should he goe. For he that doth his stomacke charge, with more than will suffise: Is hurt and then phisicions helpe, with groning voice he cryes. Then vp he throwes and all his house, doth filthy stincke possesse: Whereby him feruent feuers vexe, and humours sharpe oppresse. What sicknes great excesse doth brede, no man there is but knowes: What hurts by to much drink let down within the body growes. Wherfore he must be modest nedes, of much and little take: Who that before thapointed tyme, sweete lyfe will not forsake: Nor more than doth y? pore he must, his hungred body slake. With purple faire and clothe of golde, the riche man is arayed: His gorgeous shirt doth cast a shew, with sylke and ouerlayde. About his head he weareth aye, the fleece of Scithian bow: And Iewels fayre about his neck, of price he weares but now. Are these of greater force for to expell the bitter colde: Than if in garments made of wolle, thy body were infolde. Or doth the wouen webbe of flaxe, not so repulse the heate: Wh?as y? Sunne doth feru?t flame amid the Lion great? Or when the raging dog the fieldes, of greene doth quite defeate. As if the fine and tender sylke, enclosde thee rounde about: But thou wilt say he is estemde, whom gorgeous geare settes out. Unto hym passing by the way, the people ducke and ryse: And onely he is counted then, both noble good and wyse. And worthy worship to receiue, and frendship for to haue: No heede at all they take of hym, whose garments be not braue. The common people laugh to see, his cote then worne to nought: Though thou shouldst Tully represent, whose eloquence was thought. For to excell all Italye, or else Demosthenes: Whose famous voice the Athens men, dyd wonder at in plees. Or if thou hadst as great a gift, as Maro had in verse: Or couldst the auncient Homers tunes celestiall well rehearse. For all this same yet shouldst not thou the price of praise obtaine: But as reiect of eueryman, thou shalt receiue disdaine. In vaine thou shalt beholde the hewe, of Ganymedes face: In vaine and oft thou shalt desyre, thy damosell to embrace: If that with vile apparell thou doest runne the poore mans race. I not denie that clothing faire, estemed ought to be: But if the minde doth vertues lacke, with vices eke agree. Thy beauty all biddes then adewe and glory leaues thee quite: And euery man that knowes thee well, will haue thee in dyspite. They will thee floute behinde thy back, and greuous mocks thee giue: Thy seruant to that of thy foode, hath alwayes vsed to liue. If that he know thee for to be, a gredy Churle or such: As cruell is of hauty minde, or vseth wine to much. Or one that lacketh wit he will, regarde thee then but lyght: And grudging efte these wordes will he vnto himselfe resight. O such a maister fortune false, why diddest thou me giue? We vnder such a maister long, shall fates enforce to liue? Can other men commende him then, whose seruants so despise: But if thou valiant be and iust, both sober sadde and wise. If so be that, that learning great, doth cause thee to excell: Then to thy worship doth agree, all kynde of garments well. And no man will thee then despise, except that he be mad: And first whatsoeuer that thou art, desirous to be had. In honour to be praised much, and much to be beloued: Imbracing thou vertue flye thou vice, and that of right reproued. May bring the aucthour to a shame, beware thou not commit: For oft the common people rude, doe vse as voide of wyt. The noble vertue to despise, if so be that they see: With little spot of any vice, defyled hir to bee. But what is hee vpon the earth, that liueth voide of crime: And from the true and beaten way departeth not sometime? Or doth not swarue or runne astraye, from out the ruled lyne? But he that least and seldome synnes, hym best we may defyne. But greatest grace hath such a one, that learnedly and wyse: All things he speakes with order iuste, can well himselfe deuise. To wyse and filed speache may be, great force and strength assynde, It diuers passions doth prouoke, and gouernes well thy minde. Much more will this than costly clothe, set forth thy worthy name: Use not the loue of boyes take heede, such loue is synfull shame. For children haue no loue ne wit, no reason faith nor trust: A vengeance light on hym I wishe, that ioyes in such a lust. If that the pleasaunt portrature of maydes doe thee delyght: Go take a wife thou nedest not lack, A Dormouse for the night. What hadst thou rather foole to wyshe, and hope for things denayde: When as with easier medicine thou mayst haue thy griefe alayde? Perchaunce for thys yet riches are, to be desyred plaine: Whereby a man may sooner so, to vertue hye attaine. If voide of money cleane thou arte, no man will take the paines: Thee to enstruct for teachers sure, require no little gaines. Nor little price will thee suffice, thy selfe with bookes to store: Whereby thou maist apply thy selfe, to Lady learnings lore. Lest pouertie with other cares, doth occupy thy head: And so from learning draw thy minde, with other busines lead, O lorde howe harde a thing it is, how fewe doth God permit: To flye from base and poore estate, in honours hye to sit. How seldome doth the sely soule, ascende to honours hye: And more besydes what is his lyfe, to death and eke how nye. How much to be despysed tho, when pleasure none his minde, Doth ease, amongst his trauailes great when he no ioyes can finde. When neuer cares absences themselfes with griefes when all habounde: Yet better passe the Stigian lake, and feede the gredy hounde. And mixed be wyth shrikyng soules, then neuer ioy to finde: In happye things when neuer mirthe, shall glad thy wretched minde. For to this wretche what ioy at all, or pleasure can remaine: That lackes both meate &amp; drink full oft, sometime his bedde againe. Sometime he lacketh cote and cloke, and oft his toes be spyde: From out his clouted shoes to pepe, where seames sitte gaping wyde. With paine drawes on hys drudging lyfe, much lesse he able is: Those things to haunt y? here doe bring a mortall man to blisse. But he that hath the golden mines, in hym these things doe flowe: And euery thing he straight obtaines, wherat he bendes hys bowe. Such rule and swaye hath money nowe such force in euery place: That nothing long she wyll permit, for to resist her grace. From hie she raceth hilles adowne, and valleys vp doth hoyse: If that therefore with swifty course, of dogges he doth reioyse To take the Harte the Goate or Wolfe the flighty flying Hares: If birdes to take or fish deceaue, wyth hookes and nettes or snares. If for to serue in Uenus court, if meate or drinke delight, If quiet rest, if Lute or Harpe, him please or songes to shright: All these the rich man doth possesse, through mighty moneyes might. Now hark agayne what I shal say, to thys in contrary: If any man desire to learne, he shall it soone come by. So that his minde be constant thoe, and feareth not to tread: The sharp and crabbed thorny wayes, to vertue that do lead. If money lacke what then perforce, let houshold stuffe be solde: With house and all and meddowe to, how may my life then holde? Then shall I be constraynd to begge, and wallet vp to take: Farre better wretch it is to begge, when learning shall thee make. Like to the heauen sainctes aboue, than if thou shouldst possesse: The Persians herds &amp; droues of beasts with all their welthinesse. Beleue not thou the iudgement blinde, of rude and common sorte: No more who can than beasts discerne, the truth or it reporte. If thou be wise, mark what I saye, in mind and print it sure: Excepting vertue nothing is, that here may long endure. For riches fade and forme and strength and honour eke doth fall: And vertue onely doth remayne, in strength and euer shall. Which neuer fortune may suppresse, nor age can take away: I neuer saw it yet nor thoe, beleue it well I may. The vertuous man for hunger sterued, or left to begge his bread: Though fortune sometyme doth assay, him for to ouertread Yet vertue hasteth fast anone, and learning doth defende: His clients nor doth suffer them, their yeares in care to spende. But offers them a boorde to help, when sayle and shippe is loste: Whereby they may the shore attayne, from waues of Seas ytost. Who followeth vertue may go see, tharabian desertes fell: The Ethiops black the rugged getes, the Indes in health and well. For only vertue of her force, wyll fortune false wythstand: And oft with hir in doubtfull matche, doth striue with fighting hand. For costes thou oughtest not to spare, nor doubt the landes to sell: Wherby thou vertue mayst obtayne, yf fortune be so fell. That nought to sell at all thou haste, let goodnesse then remayne: In thee, If learnde thou canst not be, wyth learnde thy selfe retayne. With eares att?tiue mark their words, sometyme and question finde: The rest to God do thou commit, and wyth a lowly minde. Receaue thappointed fates from hie, if ioyes thou doest frequente: And hurtfull pleasure thee entrap, and in hir ginnes thee hent. And couet so thy youthfull dayes, to passe in pleasaunt sport: And therfore doest desire to beare, a rich and wealthy port. These things that reason doth thee tell, peruse thou well in minde: A greater yll and hurtfull more, than pleasure none can finde. It taketh counsell quite from vs, and doth the minde oppresse: Resisting vertues euermore, encreaseth wickednesse. It is the chiefest nource to vice, enfebleth aye the strength: With bitter ende and many hurtes, procureth man at length. But playnlier of this same anone, we wil entreate and tell: The poore man hath his ioyes also, yf that thou markest well. Not much perchaunce inferiour to, for pleasauntest be such: Obtayned ioyes that seldome happes, and ioyfuller he much. The pleasure is beleue me now, that long hath bene absented: And more desirde so meate is swete, to him that is an hungred. So rest to him that laboureth sore, so drink is to the drye: So flame vnto the friesing wight, so colde when sunne is hye. So long forborne is welcomer, to Lady Uenus fayre: For contraries by opposites, their strength do eft repayre. The rich man now will suffer nought, but alwayes doth abound: With deynties so that lothsomnesse, in him may eft be founde. Sometime he doth desire and much, on earthy rootes to grash: Sometyme on pescods fast he feedes, sometime on other trash. And royall fare wyth deynty dish, abhorring nought esteemes: Nothing so swete he then receiues, but better loe it seemes. And lykes him not if any tyme, it chanceth to endure: But chaunges new doth him delight, and for to haue in vre. Forbidden things are sweeter much, such things be nought and yll: That alwayes are at hande to haue, so not the thing but wyll. And iudgement of the minde doth cause, a man to be content: And worthy is to be imbrasde, that pleaseth his intent. What profits it vnto the sicke, to offer deynty meate: Whose tast away doth quite bereft, the feruent feuers heate. Or what auayles it vnto him, the pleasaunt wines to bring: Who euermore refrayning wine, doth ioy in cleared spring? Some one with Kid some other thoe, wyth porke refresht to be: Desireth more some songs delight, some other playes to see. So loue to all men is not like, some man a boy desires: And some a mayd and some a gyll, and some a wyfe requires. The minde and not the thing therefore, doth cause a quietnesse: Wherby the poore no lesse their ioyes, then riche men doth possesse. Excesse the riche man doth desyre, fewe things the poore suffise: To him doth greater charge of house, but lesser ioyes arise. The shipman or the labouring wight much pleasure more doe take: With egges &amp; leekes and homely foode, his hungred mawe to slake. Than kyngs &amp; Queenes w? deinty dishe of seas and lande to dine: The worthier pleasure then I thinke, of right we may define. That vsed neither causeth harme, nor honesty resystes: For best it is to couet least, and liue within the lystes. Of counsaile good nor vexed be with vaine and fonde desyre: For who the things he cannot haue, doth earnestly require. With frustrate hope is tormented, and loseth time in vaine: Wherfore desyre thou nothing els, but that thou mayst obtaine. And rule thy minde w? bridlyng bitt, but he that doth habounde: With riches, alwayes couets more. then lawfull may be founde. With little and content to liue, he knowes not yet therefore: Whom least of all doe full suffise, hym happier iudge I more. For lofty landes dose cause a man, for to excell in pride: Thimmortall gods for to despise, and men for to deride. Without all rule, a carpet knight and vertues mortall foe: For who doth vertue ought regarde, when riches swelleth so? O famous worthy pouertie, O giftes of God vnkende: Of vertues aye the safe defence, to shamefastnes a frende. The brydle tryde of wantones, and patron of the lyfe: Thou onely canst and well despise, the shamelesse fortunde ryfe. The raging of the Seas and wyndes, whilste in thy little bote: Thou kepest the safe assured foordes, and rydste by shore a flote. The loftye hylles on hye full oft the flashing lightnings smite: And spiring ashes long be bette, by northern Boreas might. Low things do lie vnknow? to harmes the tempestes neuer greues: The lowly shrouded Iunipers, nor shakes the Mirice leues. The famous Anaxagoras, and Democryte the wyse: With many mo whose worthy fame throughout the world nowe flies: Did syluer golde and riches eke, as heads of yll despyse. And why? but y? they thought they were not vertues good nor trew: Which let the minde w? diuers cares, and hedlong downe eke threw, Full many men in diuers vice, but alwayes marke thou well: What Fabrice Calo and Curins to, these holy men thee tell. Regarde not what the common sort, and foolishe route doe say: Thexample of the good alwayes, before thy eyes but lay. Dyd not Quirinus conquerour, his banners oft display: Commaunded weapons vp to take, and plough a downe to laye. And rest his deluing spade a whyle, then would the cottage small: Content the men and deinty fare, not vsed then at all. But Princely meates &amp; roufed roomes, bring forth as now a dayes: A weake a faynt and tender fruite, and apt to sport and playes. O learne you mortall men at length, put darkenes from your minde: Lyft vp a loft your dimmye eies, wherto doth will so blinde. You leade? take heede in any wyse, you thither doe not goe: By reason lyke the gods aboue, you are created loe. By reasons are the seas and lande, vnto your power subiect: Let errours not therfore as now, but reason you direct. The certaine ende of euery thing, peruse you well alwaye: And let the meate your selues suffise, that hunger driues away. And garments eke your skinnes to hide and cald for to expell: Let aye the slepe that doth refresh, your wery limmes be well. Of these three things aboue the reste, most nede we haue alway: Sith these our bodies are compact, of vile and brittle claye. But yet thou oughtst those things to vse as Phisick for to heale: The diuers sicknesse that to man, dame nature wontes to deale. Some one we see in daynty fare, doth riot most embrace: Some other in excesse of clothes, and some whilst they apace. From learning flye do vneth knowe, nor once this life perceaue: When euermore wyth sluggish slepe, their eyes togyther cleaue. But happy is he that is content, with little to remayne: Nor puts his trust in things so frayle, that death will him constrayne. To leaue behinde as none of his, and wayeth well in minde: How short the space is of our life, how all things vayne we finde. That here on earth created be, who alwayes one remaynes: In prosperouse eke and aduerse chance, the iudge nor Stigian paynes. Regardeth not and nought esteemes, what euer fortune flyng: Unhappy is he whom will doth leade, vnmindfull of the thing That is to come, but like to beastes, regardes the thing in syght: Who knoweth not that by how much, the minde is more of might. Than is the corps, so much the more, in gifts it doth excell: Riches be not the chiefest goodes, therefore appeareth well. For these bicause for bodies wealth, they onely out be sought: The manners of the owners eke, we see they better nought. Who wil accompt them chiefest goods? for often times we see: Such men with riches as abounde, like brutish beastes to bee. As much therfore as will suffise, thy life no more require: For in excesse do fooles reioyce, in vaine thou doest desyre. Thy barnes vnheaped &amp; hugyemowes, of corne when thou as well: With lesser measure though by much, thy hunger mayst expell. When little cuppes shall thee suffise, why doest thou tunnes desyre? But yet if Putus doe thee loue, and plentie on thee flyre. And eke the will vnknowne of fates, hath riches delte to thee: What wouldst thou doe? that thou hadst learnde it semeth best to mee. Least by possession thou be worse, a dolte and counted plaine: And tell mee now I thee require, what wisdome doth remaine. Or counsell else to him in whom, great riches euer flowe? And by what meanes them for to vse, the foole doth nothing know. Hereby doth strength and often hurte, and beautie eke anoye: By reason lyke the aucthour oft, doth eloquence destroy. And by these meanes are diuers artes, full hurtfull oft to many: Let not the snare of auarice, thee catche but from her flie. Than thys there is no fury fierce, assuredly more fell: Begotten once in Acheron, amyd the raigne of hell. She was where flaming fyerbrandes, she dreadfully doth cast: A hundred thretning heades shee beares wyth vgly adders brast. Her gredy iawes with bloud of men, coulde neuer haue their fill: With churlish chaps deuouring meat, yet foode requirthe shee still. She spareth none nor god hys churche, once feareth to defyle: This cursed neuer fylled beast, and wicked monster vile. Of hir come plagues &amp; slaughters sharp wyth discorde and distresse: Wyth treasons brawlings and disceits and losse of shamefastnesse. Contempt of God with periuries, and chydings fell with fight: With many more which in my verse, I cannot well resyght. From this therfore flye thou thy way nothing doth more infest: Nor nothing more than this declares, a vile vnworthy brest. So women, aged men and boyes, doe couet most alwayes: Because they lack both strength &amp; force, in minde and haue no stayes. An other vice contrary now, to this doth yet remaine: This same from the to banishe quite, thy senses looke thou straine. If thou dost spende without respect, in vaine thou shalt beholde: An hungred eft anothers spitte, with deinties manifolde. When all thy liuing quite is spent, by ryote cleane destroyde: Betwene them both the vertue lyes, the vice therefore auoide. As reason doth require to giue, and euermore take heede: Be not to bolde to vse excesse, within thy tether feede. This ende hath riches we are bounde, all men to profite thoe: But first our owne dame nature sure, hath vs created so. That not alone to vs and ours, we should commodious be: But also if that powre wyll serue, to all of eche degree. What thing more famous is than thys, what more deserues the place: Of gods aboue then for to helpe, the poores afflicted case? So shall the people honor vs, so get we fame thereby: And by such actes to gods full oft, we see doe many flye. Nothing doth more a man become, nothing for him more meete: As sayth the olde and auncient schoole, of Philosophers sweete. Than man to aide and succour soone, hys fellowe falne to grounde: But now alas O dolefull times. and fashions nothing sounde. All godlinesse is clean extinct, to no man geues doubtlesse: The welthy wretche although he hath wherwith to giue excesse. Of no man thoe he pitie hath, all heartes doe yron seeme: Who geueth the begger nowe a myte, their teares they nought esteeme. If ought they giue to scoffers now, or else to rake hell knaues: They do it deale to Colmon birds, and eke to handy slaues. No man doth giue the learned ought, the muses be despised: In euery place some one we see, so much hath exercised. The dyse and tables tyll his purse, at length the gorge doth cast: So oft an other vies at Cardes, tyll all his goods be past. And is not this a greater shame, thus money for to spend: Wherby no honour is obtaynde, nor thank is got at thende. O minde forgetting God and eke, wyth vices vile defilde: And is it lawfull this to doe, didst thou not once a childe. Come naked from thy mothers womb, and shalt retourne agayne: Resolued vnto durty earth, from whence thou camste certayne? O foole these goods be none of thine, but vnderneath the hande: Of God aboue and thou but here, a straunger in the lande. And bursser for a while of them, ne be the goods at all: But onely now the vse of them, to our subiection thrall. For when the Gresilde Charon olde, shall beare thee past the lake: By which the gods aboue to sweare, do tremble eft and quake. Then here y? wretch to other heyres, the goods thou shalt forsake: Wherefore we ought to vse them wel, while line of lyfe doth last: In occupying about our selues, and helping others fast. Now haue I well declarde I thinke, if riches ought to bee: Accompted for the chiefest goodes, all men may playnly see. My bote draw backe we haue assayde, the seas sufficiently: Lo causing cloudes the southerne winde beginneth fast to flye. Upsuckt the floudes from out the seas, the whirlewindes vp do beare: Which doth declare a storme to come, not best we tary heere. Beleue me now for sore I feare, to shippes vntrusty Orion: Whilst time we haue let vs dispatche, to port and get vs gon. When as the banisht cloudes aboue, shall make the day be fayre: Then Triton shall vs call from hye, and we to seas repayre. The third Booke entituled Gemini. Vprising was the dauning day and fading starres did sh?ne The heauens hie of Tit? thoe and half to apeare begunne. To them that vnder vs do dwell, and halfe discernde our eyes: I meruayld much to see as then, the fier vppe to ryse. Amyd the floudes vnquenched thus, these contraries no doubt: Ech other now do quite destroy, but is the sunne put out. With flouds? it is not fiery then, or else to touch the brinke: Of Occean sea, the common sort do lye, thus did I thinke. While as by shore I walked alone, beholde there gan me meete: An aged man with staffe in hand, in clothur neate and sweete. His hoary beard with syluer heares, his middle fully rought: His skin was white and ioyfull face, of diuers colours wrought. A flowry garland gay he ware, about his seemely heare: When as we met and made vnto, ech other frendly cheare. Fr? whence I came, what place I seke, my name he doth desyre: I aunswered him and did the like, wyth shamefast voyce requyre. But after that he had declared, his proper name certayne: For Epicure this man he height, I was astonished playne. Like as the poore and labouring soule, in deluing of the grounde: A hydden chest amyd the earth, by lucky chaunce hath found. And thus I sayd good father olde, such fauour mayst thou finde: Amongst the gods that al things wel, may satisfy thy minde. Syth wisdom great and wondrous eke, within thy breste doth dwel: If falsly men do not affirme, as eft they doe. Now tell Unto me here I thee beseche, of grace the good preceptes: With witty sawes and eke instruct, my youth if nothing lets. More wayghty affayres: quod he againe no wayghty affayres me let, But for that cares and worke I shunne oft tymes my selfe to get. Unto this place I wonted am, and floures vp to take: Of diuers hewes amid the meades, head garlandes for to make. Willing therfore wyth all my heart, to aunswere thy request: I am for olde men all to chat, it doth delight vs best. But least by some that passe the way, we here disturbed be: Let vs go hence, and vnderneath, the shaded holmey tree: That by the waters syde thou seest: our selues we wyll repose. We went and thus with pleasant voyce his minde he gan disclose. Some god young man thee hither now assuredly hath sent: Wherby this day thou might perceaue, by wisdome what is ment, For O the gods in what a mist, and darknesse of the minde: Is drent as now the whole estate, of mortall humaine kinde. Of them that beare the face of men, two thousand thou mayst see: But one that shewes himselfe a man, is scarcely found to bee. A den of doltes that now the world, may termed be ful well: And place wyth errors stuft therfore giue eare what I thee tell: If wretched darknesse fr? thy minde thou seekest to expell. And first of all thou ought to knowe, the true felicity: Which wyth a reason firme and good, ought searched forth to be. Hereof doth wisdome flow w? streames, hereof she doth appeare: But fewe there be that can attaine, the truth away to beare. For riches to be chiefest good, the greatest sort do say: An other part doth honour take, to be the chiefest away. And diuers men in diuers things, the chiefest good doe fynde: But I the price aboue the rest, to pleasure haue assignde. And this my part I trust I can, by reason good defende: It is the marke that all shoote at, and eke the finall ende. To which, the actes and dedes of men, be altogither bent: Euen as vnto thappointed marke, the shooters shaft is sent. Who euer would the earth with rakes, or Seas with Ores haue tryed? Or martyall power by force of armes, who durst haue occupyed? In fyne, who euer would haue sought, vertue to come vnto: If pleasure then or hope thereof, dyd not enforce hym so? For this the chiefe beginning is, the midst and eke the ende: Of laboures all, for proofe therof, thy minde a whyle attende. All workes if thagent reason haue, vnto some ende are donne: The workm?s handes it moues therto, and first in minde begonne. It is: But last of all the deade, it selfe comes forth to lyght: The ende therof is good therfore, the worke doth more delight. The will thereof, with great delight, the ende for to obtaine: Doth force the labour light to be, the cause is pleasure plaine. For truely nothing else it is, but pleasure of the minde: And synce by reason harde it is, to teache the rude and blinde. I will attempt by simlitudes, the truth for to declare: Why delues the plowm?s clubbishe h?d, &amp; teares the earth w? share? For all the heate of flaming dogge, hys worke he doth not spare. Nor hoary winter froste. Why fears, the shipman not in minde: The raging rage of surging Seas, with threatning Rocks so blind? Despisying death at hande in hope, of maste with sayly pyne: Why doth the Captaine to the fielde, hys manfull minde encline? And fiersly doth reioce when as he heares the Trompettes blow: With hynieng noyse of foming horse, hys heart begynnes to glow. Why doth it some delyght alwayes, with papers pale to bee: And bookes of diuers authors made, with daily paine to see? Certes for that that after time, when labours long depart: S?e gaine or fame may giue him cause for to reioice in heart. For if so be that fame and gaine, should not the minde ascende: With ioye both vertue &amp; artes withall, would soone be at an ende. For of it selfe the ende is sweete and for the ende is thought: Both middest &amp; former factes so sweete, it forceth also nought. Of vyle or else of honest state, the deades do seeme to be: For as the lewde lycentious man, reioyseth vice to see. In vertue lykewise euermore, the good mans Ioyes doe stande: All things therfore for pleasures sake, we surely take in hande. For pleasure men decline fr? harmes, for this they gaines require: Things worthy praise or else reproche through this they doe desyre. With onely this the Goddes aboue, contented surely bee: For profyte is for them vnmeete, synce nought they lacke we see. But thou perchaunce wilt say the gods, with honest ioyes abounde: What then? If with such ioyfull goods, in them no ioye is founde? As if thou shouldest w? glistering golde and pearles a stocke aray: An other thing here adde, as oft, as cause be perfect may. It nedefull is the like effect, from thence should then proceede: When as therefore that force of lyte, is well disposde in deede. And chiefest good obiect to it, it alwayes doth retayne: That this is happiest happinesse, denieth no man playne. But now from out such fountayne, loe, is pleasure forst to runne: With musick so the eares reioyce, of numbers apte begunne. So is the syght wyth beauty pleasde, the nose with goodly smell: This iudgement eke I do pronounce, of other partes as well. What sayst thou now to Uenus worke, that creatures all doth make? And this the pleasauntst pleasure is, except thou truth forsake. Moreouer yet both payne and griefe, since greatest yls they bee: Contrary eke to pleasure now, by right we pleasure see. To be the chiefest good deserues, of contraries also: The reason lyke contrary is, that sad things to forgo. By natures force all things do seke, and pleasures do embrace: Who may beleue that once wyl vs, deceaue that natures grace? The chiefest good therfore it is, that creatures all do loue: But what loue they, or seeke they for, but pleasaunt ioyes to proue? That we must vertue seke agayne, some sort there be that say: By swet and colde while here we liue, and pleasure cast away. And after death they say we shall, in perfit pleasure liue: Which god to those that do him loue, prepared hath to giue. This voyce wyth reason cannot stande, but shewes it selfe as vayne: For that the soule doth after liue, when death the corps hath slayne. Or that it lurkes in lothsome lake, of Tartares griesly den: And payes the paynes of his deserts, and takes rewardes as then. Of former factes ought none beleue, except his senses fade: O fooles it is your Poets mad, that haue these fables made. Who euer wonted were to write such foolishe fayned toyes: Whereby they might delight the eares of fooles with frustrate ioyes. The yrksome place they fayned haue, of Stigian tiraunt fell: Wher flames y? flouds of Phlegeth? that burnes with roaring yell: Whereas the triple headed dog, and Tisiphone doth dwell With adders armde of paynted hewe, and gressly Gyaunts great: wyth dreadfull darkenes voide of lyght and fyres whose flaming heat. Consumes no wood, where frieseth cold without the wynters space: The bote without the force of oke, here creketh in this place. whilste her wyth soules doth ouerlode the aged Ferriman: Here Sisiphus the stone torments, and Tantale waters wanne. The fiffty ristye vesselles heare, matemurdring systers beare: From whence the waters out do gush, that kept in vaine are there. Much more than I haue heare declarde these Poets pilde haue taught, In hell to be, which are not true, of children to be thought. O gods how great a lacke of wit, there is in euery place: How prone the way to trifles is, and credite you this case, O voide of wyt? which neuer coulde, by reason ought be proued: Nor by no sense may be desernde, with feare why are you moued? Of things so vaine, who credites most, is most himselfe deceaued: These are I say deceitfull things, whereby be priestes releaued. For when that once our vitall breath, is faded cleane away: No more we be than first we were, before our natall daye. O to much weake to fraile and proude, O nature bolde of man: whereby doest thou perswade thy selfe to liue for euer than? Leaue of therefore thou lumpe of claye, the yeares of gods to wyll: All things begonne shall haue an ende, nothing remaineth styll. Both cities great, and mighty men, and vastye realmes withall: The hautiest hylles and greatest flouds doth time at length let fall. And thinkest thou (O fading dust) for euer to remaine? Is hope of minde with thee so great? we trauaile but in vaine. In trusting dreames for vertues sake, and fayning fansies strange: That be but fooles that things assured, for vnassurde will chaunge. Forsakyng thus assertainde here, with doubtfull things to meete: But yet of olde, and auncient fame, rewardes remaineth sweete. Of little force this nothing is, when death hath had his right: Thou nothing art, for what is fame, if it doe nought delight? The corps in graue, what doth y? stone or stocke reioce in prayes? If here thou hast not them, thou shalt haue neuer happy dayes. Therefore while this our brittle lyfe, vncertaine eke doth last: The wyse man, to his power will ioy: nor straite wyll downe be cast. As oft as fortune on him frownes, wyll seeke the pleasaunt life: If any thing to him shall hap, of bitter eygre strife. Wherefore bicause I will not now, thee frustrate here retaine: (O yong man) ioy while time permits, and banishe dolefull paine. When these his wordes my berded sire had moued me to beleue: Good father then (quod I) for these thy paines I cannot geue. Thee worthy thanks, but whilst I liue, I shall to thee be bounde: Within my heart, and eke I shall, reserue thy sayings sounde. One doubt within my brest doth yet, assuredly remaine: For not the deedes we onely must, but learne them to obtaine. Therefore I doe require you now, to teache me here the way: That wyll me leade to pleasures place, whereby it haue I may. The way is short and plaine withall, then grayberde to me tels: Not farre from hence voluptnousnesse, that lusty Lady dwels. Whom if thou doest desire to see, come after me a pace: Wherby thou mayst by me reioice, in finding out hir grace. One parte of three the starry orbes, had scarce past ouer than: When stackring vp himself did rayse, thunweldy aged man. Who leading foorth I followed on, and hand in hand we went: By straunge vnhaunted wayes we goe, and space a little spent: Beholde appeares a sumptuous house, and strayght I aske my guide: What honour kepes that precious gem and princely palace wide? Plutus quod he possesseth this, and eke an armed knight: The way to kepe and men to passe, forbiddeth by his might. Except they come him first vnto, and please him wyth some gift: But he himself doth holde his hall, amid yon towry clift. Three daughters eke he only hath, within his bowre to dwell: Whose names if thou desire to knowe, I shall thee briefly tell. The first of them is filthy excesse, the second puffed pride: The third is foolish ignoraunce, with countnaunce bolde besyde. Who then quod I shal leade vs now, vnto this famous kyng? Three maydes he hath quod gresil thoe, that thereto wyll thee bring. Chance, fraud and vsury, by these, haue all men easy way: I haue no gifts then aunswered I, that giue these maydes I may. Nor safe it is such girles to trust, some other way declare: There is quod he another way, there is a way to spare. which if thou sayst the word we go, leade me thereto quod I: Togither both we went therwyth, where depe a vale did lie. with stones the way was all beset, by which our iourney lay: And so begrowne wyth crabbed thorns: that scarce we see the way. Hereby we found the ragged house, of seely pouerty: With top vntylde we past it thoe, and streight a wood we spye. Beholde, then sayth my guide to me, beholde yon trees so hie: Which w? their tops do seme to touch, the steamed starry skie. There dwels y? worthy quene (quod he,) by whom we shall be blest: But first thou must wash hand and face and get thee neatly drest. The Goddesse loues no nastinesse, nor slouens can abide: A riuer small I then perceiude, by grauayle ground to glide. Which wyth a pleasaunt hushing so?d, prouoked the loyes of bed: Here washt I fayre my face and hands, and combde my rugged hed. I trimde my clothes in order fine, and lightnesse hath expelde: All graue and earnest things: so that wyth mirth my way I helde. No further of than once a man, a stone may from him sling: The wood was then whereas we heare the birdes full swetely syng. And floures swete and fayre we smell. of which inowe ther growes: Such woods tharabian neuer saw, though franconcense there flowes. Nor yet the Easterne Indian thoe, nor Scith the like doth see: Though round about he is beset, wyth bowes of lawrell tree. Nor Atlas that the rowling skies, with shoulders doth sustayne: Though Satirs in the place doth da?ce whom Fayries loue doth payne. A riuer milde about it runnes, wyth comely water cleare: The bankes so farre asonder stode, as leapes the chased Deare. And in the depth a doughty droue, of scaley beastes they play: And for a wall it compasde is, with lofty pines so gay. With pines that in their crabbed barks doth Cibels loue contayne: And Phebus Cipresse standes them by, of equall heigth agayne. There lackes no mastes Esculus, no Mapple, Holme nor Oke: Nor plaintree, Corke, nor yet the nutte that colour doth prouoke. The Arbute, and the Alder tree, the Chestnut, and the Ashe: The Filbert, Pechtree and the Palme, the Byrch with spriggy lashe. The Firretre, and the mirtle eke, and brode leaude Beechy wood: When Saturn ruled the golden world, which was our fathers foode. The Uine, the Figge and Apple eke, and Lotos Pryaps frend: The Iuey and the Laurell tree, that Poets heads doth shend. The Mulberry and the Poplartree, that Hercule once estemde: The Peartree, willow, and the Prime, with Boxe that whitley semde. The Medlar and the Oliue tree, the Elme and Cherrey red: The Codtree and the Almon eke, whose floures first do spred. What should I here the Cedre tree, or Hebron call to minde: Or Cytre fitte for Tables fine, whom golde his place resynde. Or other more whose names if thou, dost take in hand to tell: Thou soner mayst in number bring, the Egiptian sands as well. Thus in we go whereas the bridge, doth ioyne the bankes in one: Of ample space and semely syght, their alleyes long they gone, Wyth Purple Roses red and white, and Paunseys paynted hewe: White Daffodils and violets swete, wych flagrant Lillies blewe. Swete Amaranthe that long doth liue, wyth leaues of crimson die: The Cloue wyth Balme and Cassia to, Mynt Time and Sauerie. With Saffr? Myrhe and Maioram, the Gardens onely gem: Of fauoure sweete in Idale woodes, ynow there growes of them. Both here and there in euery place, swete sauours vp they fume: A thousand kindes of Birdes do fill, the woodes with euery tune. With diuers notes the cleared ayre, they caused to resounde: There Progne wayles the gret vntroth that in her loue was found. And Philomela doth bewayle, her owne and Itis case: In humaine voice and painfull throte, the Parat prates apase. Their varying softly notes so fine, the Goldfinch fast doth sing: And waters flowes the flowers vpon, from cleare continuall spring. And here and there their courses runne and moystes the hearbes so grene: No Dragon there nor greedy wolfe, might euer yet be seene. No Bore, no Beare nor Tigre fierce, nor Serpent foule there dwels: To harme with triple hissing toung, with poyson fierce that swels. In fine no kinde of beast there is, but such as peace hath sworne: The longeard wat, the Hart, the Buck, the Goate with harmelesse horne. The middle heauens then almost, the flaming Phebus helde: When first we saw the gorgeous place, whereas thys Lady dwelde. Amid the woods an aumple space, full of grene herbes we see: No tree there grewe but tables rounde, in order placed be. With deinties such as Capna did, the oneyde duke prepare: Such deinties as they once did eate, the sacred shieldes that bare. The time is come quod Gresill nowe let vs go drinke and fill: Our bellies: Strength for to repayre, it is the goddesse wyll. That none shall passe wyth sober head, nor yet with hungred mawe: For scotfree here may all men feede, thys is the Ladies lawe. Wh? meate doth faile, her maides do fil the table full againe: A pace wee feede and scarce can rise, so wetes the wine our braine. With doubtfull steps our feete do trede, with stackryng stumpes we go: More earnestly we then desyre, the Queene to come vnto. Whom in the fielde we walking finde, with mighty mirthfull traine: Young lusty guts wyth hopes &amp; maides and doting age againe. On her right hande a woman goes, with pleasant shining face: And in her hande a boye she leades, from downe whose shoulders place. A dreadful quyuer hanges with shaftes, both cruell sharpe and kene: And in his handes a bowe he bare, and drewe the string so tene. Though blinde he was yet straight hee threwe at euery man his darte: And fierslye to without regarde, he perced to the heart. The shaft returneth straight againe, when wyde the wounde is left: The people all incontinent, he had of lyfe berefte. But that a certaine woman there, that pityed much the sore: Of Godly zeale vnto these men, gan helpe and helth restore. For when the wounded brestes she saw whereas the darte went in: Of any man, and bloud so warme, that gushing out did spin. Then strayte she runnes her cure vnto, and healthfull drinkes him giues: Wherby though cruell wound remain, the pacient yet he lyues; An other woman yet besydes, in left hande leades the Queene: Whose chaps do alwaies chaw y? cudde, her golles they gresy beene. Wyth musty dusty lothsome clothes, whose stynke doth all anoye: And onely to shee doth delight, in beastly belly ioye. Great tanckards depe she turneth quite the bottoms vpsey downe: And in her hande a boy she leades, wyth drousy droupyng crowne. And winking eies, he scarce could wake nor woulde his dame permit: With meate &amp; drink thus ouerchargde to haue a waking fyt. A moyster straunge on her he flyngs, heere soundes with wheasing noyse: The boxen shalme, with stroke y? harpe. is forcde to shewe his voice. Here Orpheus doth bewayle hys wife, with tooth of serpent torne: The dire decrees of darksome den, and labours past and worne. And after him both beast and stone, by musyck swete he drawes: To Delphins eke Arion here, doth swetely syng his sawes. With harpe the noble Amphion here, doth Thebes walles renewe: Declaring here his cruel case, by shipmen eke vntrewe. And after these with friskyng legges, comes Dauncing all the rest: Whose eyes a certaine dymnes darcke, had fully then opprest. About the heades of euery one, their flyes a stincking mist: And one amongst them all I knewe, that helde this writte in fyst. Sardanapalus here am I, that rulde with princely powre: Thassyrians Realme loe thys haue I, for that I did deuoure. O foolishe wretches, whylest you lyue, let neuer Ioyes so go: For after death alas there are, no Ioyes to come vnto. Learne you by mee O mortall men, the trewest way to knowe: Now last of all two Monsters came, amyd the vtterst rowe. Wherof the one with diuers tonges, these fellowes fowle arayde: The other vexed them sore with pricks, that griefe their Ioye alayde. So much the heauens vs do hate, reioysing at our yll: So farre the Gods aboue doe seme, contrary to our wyll. And though wyth these aduersities, we passe our dayes in payne: Yet haue we not one houre to ioy, in quiet to remaine. If ought we haue it is but short, and ioy vnperfect framed: O lyfe that doste of ryght deserue, exilement to be named. Why doth the harmes of mortall men, the Goddes aboue delight: Why had they rather sad we were, than liue in ioyfull plight. Whereof did fyrst spring out to vs, such mortall hatred fell: Wynne thou the gods w? pacient mind, in bearing euils well. No space we were of any length, from this vnrulye game: When from the right side of the woode, came forth a comely Dame. With body fyne and virgins face, and sober semely gate: Such one as Ioue his wife is thought, amyd her great estate. with haire, and bosom torne, she runnes to vs in dolefull plight, And not to be despysde she was though clothes were base to syght. And from her ruddy rosye lyppes, these witty wordes did spryng: O caytifes whereto pace you thus, whereto shall phrensy bring. You now? stay here, set down your fete and leape not to the snare: And hearken to my wordes a whyle, that I shall heere declare: Fyrst this (quod she) no goddesse is, nor her no goddesse bare. As you (perchaunce) beleue she is, to whom as now you goe, To tentes of whom you couet now to Ioyne your selues vnto. But is a dredefull drery sprite, deceiuing all that liues: Unwares of her deceitfully, and gall for honey giues. Let not the face deceiue you now that semeth fayre without: That glisters aye with shining golde beset with gemmes aboute. You know not yet how foule she is, within those garments gaye: A thousande spots within she hath and castes her men away. Deceiude with false defrauding ioye: as fishe their bane come by: Whom crafty fysher doth begyle, with reede deceitfully. When from the rockes, into the floudes he casteth downe his lyne: With harmefull baite the hooke so hyd, with hastye course they hine. And snatche with gredye iawes y? bayte and fast they hang thereby: And following fast the twyrling threde theyr daunce full dolefully: The quiuering sandes of Libiaes lande we nede not for to flye: Ne fearefull Atiphates house, ne Scillaes rocke so hye. Nor dreadefull drenching Charibdis, nor other monster fell: So much as ought we pleasure shunne what harmes hereby do dwell. In mortall men? what townes? what realmes? what men of worthy fame Hath it destroide? I wilbe short, and one example name. Who euer yet Alcides past, who durst such deedes assay? That slew two serp?ts foule sometimes in cradle as he lay. He tore the tushes from them both, and thrust his handes so small: In midst their throtes. He caused hath, Molorchus beast to fall. He cut the foule Echydnaes head: destroyde the dreadfull drake: The fearefull bull adowne he threw, and swifty Hart did take. He hath expelde the Stimphalides by force of valeant bowe: The Thracian tyrauntes stable eke, his hande did ouerthrowe. He turnde thy course Achelous, and brake thy winding creke: He toke the Apples from the maydes, and spoilde the Spanishe freke. Of hugie kyne, He did descende adowne the pyt of hell: The dreadfull dog from thence he drew, that fometh poyson fell. The Bore of Erymantus to, was slaine of that same hand: And Anthenes eke the strength of him, lift vp did vnderstand. He felt it eke that Oxen stale, Dan Uulcanes wyly whelpe: And after all the wery sire, he could olde Arias helpe. The starres aboue and swaying poules, whose shoulders do instayne: But O thou hurtfull pleasure loe, deceatful eke and vayne. The Lordly hests of Gigian mayde, with will he did obay: And he whom dire Megeraes force, nor fende might once affray. Nor quiuering Tartares frosty colde, nor flames of Phlegethon: Nor vggly Charons dreadfull loke, with bristled haires vpon. Did often fondly feare the threats, of milde vnmighty mayde: For shield in hand a distaffe beares, for helme wyth coyfe arayde. The hande also that once was wont, vnweldy clubbe to shake: In maydely guise then towe to spinne, and eke accountes to make. Of taske perfourmed. And vnto her the bondled flax he beares: whilst clothed in wom?s wed the stroke, of mistres whip he feares. Amphitrions sonne, what beastly toye, hath made the thus so blinde? For as that hag dame Circes did, transforme to swinish kinde. Ulisses mates bewrapt their bones, in stubborne bristles harde: So doth your Quene (nay rather slaue,) chaunge them that hir regarde. For dish in hand to them she geues, of pleasaunt poyson full: Of which who drinks is straight transformd in Lion, Bore or Bull. Or made a dogge or else a wolfe, the common plague to sheepe: And other into diuers shapes, are thus compelde to creepe. But few of that same sort there be, this deathly cup that flye: And you your selues these fearful fates, shall shortly sure come by. If thou perchaunce wil after runne, the banners of this hore: Wherfore be wise and flye the snares, I warne you sirs before. Whylst time will serue wyth brideling bits, and rule your wilful minde: And in the priuy hidden snares, let not your eyes be blinde. Least she like as the spyder doth, begyle the siely flye: Whilste as in tender webbe she lurkes, and in her bowre doth lye. But when that she doth perceyue, the gyltlesse soule intrapt: Then out wyth cruell course she comes, the corps in cordes so clapt. The dusty twyst with nimble legges, about it fast she windes: wyth deadelye styngs she thrustes hym through, and suckes the bloud she findes. O mad to mad, which when he may, to gods compared be: By reason rulde, yet brutish trayne, to haunt delighteth he. In vsing eft of lecherous actes, and pampering Uenus frende: His gredy paunch and beastlinesse, he followeth to his ende. These words wyth pacience coulde not beare, my lusty gresild gyde: But mourning this his wil so broke, and angred eke beside. With mumbling wordes: I know not what he turnes fr? vs his face, And, vnto his acquainted mates, ran three legde sire a pace. Arete then (for this hir name, she termde her selfe to be) Let Gresil flye from hence away, regarde not thou quod she. The Owle to darknesse vsde, cannot, the glistring sunne abide: And as the sick whome feuer long, wyth raging heate hath tride. Refuseth such as may to him, his health agayne restore: Things worse and hurtfull to his life, desiring rather more. So fooles do follow false things most, and from the truth they flye: But flie not thou my warning heare, if elth thou doest set by. Which that y? mayst more aptly heare, walke now this way wyth me: For with these sights the minde is let, and eares disturbed bee. Then towards the right hand forth shee leades, and vnderneath a bay: That strode thereby, we both sit downe, and thus she gan to say. That workman first that made the skies the earth and seas also: As all the spheares he hath compelde, gaynward the first to go. So would he that theffectes of minde, should reason eke gaynsay: Least minde alone within the corps, with dulnesse should decay. For as the Horse by force of spurre, and Oxe, with gode a right: Are forcde to go, and by the smart, receiue the greater might. So sharp with force, theffects the minde encreased by restraynt: The which effectes if they were not, the minde straight ways would faint. And would no worthy thing perfourme like as the ship doth slugge: Except the windes her sayles do puffe, and Ores by force hir drugge. Some greatly erre therfore that say, such tumultes of the minde: A wiseman neuer ought to feele, like forme in marble finde. These men do think a man to be: and doting preach in vayne: For then in vayne had nature dealt, to man such motions playne. Which is to base for to confesse, we may them therfore vse: Most lawfully if reasons rule, and arte thereto we chuse. These greate affections of the minde, with bridle strong he guides: And as the horseman rules his horse, so rules he them besides. Nor once is ouer runne of them, he, that deserues to bee: A wise man namde, and not in vayne, but fewe there be we see. That vertue knowes for to obtayne, in measure for to stay: Some sort therefore this same do loue, some take it cleane away. Both sortes therby in error hault, for, onely gods alone: By reason liues, and beastes agayne, with onely sense do grone. But man with both is full adornde, commaunded to reioyse: In both also: in reason most, this part is worthier choyse. And more celestiall eke it is, and lifteth men alofte: Wher lust doth throw m? hedl?g down and makes them dote full ofte. Wherfore we ought it least to bey, although (O nature blinde: Of men) that euery man it hauntes, and few can reason finde. A sort therfore amyd the wood, saunce number sawe we play: To which euen thou with doltish guide, hadst helde thy foolish way. But that our voyce did thee withdrawe, and didst thou nothing feare: Those m?sters two, with stealthy steps that followed after there? Knowest thou their names? the one is grefe the other slaunder hight: I not forbid nor graunt such ioyes, of sense proceding right. But rare I would that they should be, and eke no vertues foe: For which it neuer lawfull is, things honest to let goe. But bridells strong thou nedest sure, and closely them to take: For else they hurt: and ioyfull things, wil malice not forsake. Disordring all and loke how much, a man doth from them flye: So much the more he doth approch, the seate of Ioue on hye. And he that hauntes them most of all, is worthy least of prayse: Abasing eke himself therwyth, with beastes he leades his dayes. They hurt besydes when as they be, to dayly vse retainde: And daungers dire be got therby, and minde with lets is painde. Nor can the minde be alwayes yet, to seuere things addict: For frayle it is and ioy it must, when endes the sad afflict. And downe the highest hilles descende, to valleyes depe and lowe: No otherwise than when on earth, doth Ioue his lightning throwe. Hating the crimes that here be done, the Egle bearing fast: Wyth byll or feete, the three edgde tole, in Cicil fornace cast. Ascends the toppes of heauens hie, and maruayles much to see: The Princely walles wyth precious stones that there adourned bee. Astonished is to see the place, of glistering gold confect: That shines wyth starres she doth beholde with Diamond pillers deckt. The costly roufes she loked vpon, of Indian teeth compacte: She meruayles at the ample fielde, and light that neuer lackt. The great delightes that gods are in, that tong cannot expresse: Nor neuer heart of man could thinke, the worthy pleasauntnesse. She flying fast both here and there, desireth much to play: By skies so cleare and pleasaunt ayres, begins hir wings to spray. The earth, and quite she doth forget, her nest is out of minde: In princely rayne of thundring God, such pleasure doth she finde. But after that by hungers prick, with fasting strength decayes: And heate lackes foode to worke vppon, that now she gan to prayse. The heauens hie she doth despise, and downe her selfe she speedes: To ground, that late she did contemne, and there apace she feedes. Then I which held my peace so long, (such silence for to breake:) Addrest my selfe and not affrayd, her tale to stoppe, gan speake. Bycause (quod I) the sunne as now, gan westward first descend: And night doth hast his course to vse, before this light do wende. Away from vs and darknesse c?mes, a few things shew to me: O goddesse milde (no matrone thou, but seemes a ghost to be.) What name the woman had, of late, that I saw yonder stand: Besydes the Quene, &amp; what the boyes be, that she led in hand. Then in this sorte shee aunswered me, doubt not, thou shalt discerne: By me (if time do nothing let) all that thou seekes to learne. Unworthy things thou hast not askt, I will therfore resight: Her now, that on the left hand goes, and greedy but shee hight. Her great delight is for to eate, and night and day to drinke: The greatest sorte do worship her, and for a god her thinke. With ioyfull hearts the flaming wines, in gilded holes they mash. And costly cates on bourdened bourdes, the gredy guts they grash. The chiefest good they think to be, this belly god to serue: But out of doubt I thee assure, they from the truth do swerue. For nothing is more vile than this, nor harmeth more the state, Of man: The beastes for onely lyfe, did Ioue aboue create. But man for life and reason to, and that he should excell: And so be like vnto the sainctes, which in the heauens dwell. He ordaynde hath to rule the earth, but they that loue the yoke: Of gredinesse and belly ioyes, are dull, and with the smoke. Of fuming meates their wit is darckt, (like as the cloudes the sunne:) Ne may they yet the truth discerne, but chiefly when begunne. Hath boyling wines within the brest, to blinde and dull the witte: And when the paunch is stuffed ful, for bookes they be vnfitte. Wherby it often c?mes to passe, their witte but small to bee: The end that nature plaste them for, they cleane forsake we see. Nor more they knowe, than doth y? herd of Shepe or Oxen dull: Yea lesse sometyme when as with wine their beastly braynes be full. When as for one, two lightes they see, with borde and wall to daunce: O dronkennesse, the death of minde, the broode of all mischaunce. What thing dost thou not force y? mind, of man to take in hande? What dare not he attempt thorow thee both strife wyth brawling, and Most cruell frayes thou mouest him to, thou ioyest when bloud is shead: By thee are secretes eft reuealde, wyth minde and tong made dead. Both feare and shamefastnesse also, full farre they flye from thee: Shunne you this plague (O wretches) now that makes you mad to be. And euen as as mad as once Orest- es was with mothers might: What filthier thing? what beaste more vile than is the dronken wight? The meate that he not long before, hath fast deuoured vp: He perbrakes out, he trembles eke, and stinketh of the cup. Ful oft he falles and breaks his browes his eyes and legs withall: His stutting wordes he stamereth out, no man perceiue him shall. Much things he sayth, &amp; much he doth, that when the night is gone: And sunne is present here agayne, he sorrowes sore vppon. The Macedonian King, the sonne, of Phillip graund le Roy: In dronken mode, at table once, his frends did all destroy. But when the cups their fumes had left and wit returnde agayne: He found the fault, w? tears he mournd, and wisht himself as slayne. Why boast you with your Orgies vain in woodes of Citheron? Your Thias da?ce, why brag you now your foolyshe dr?ms vpon? No God your Bacchus is Iwis, that comes of Cadmus line: Nor Ioue him got of Semels wombe, as Poetes doe define. But hell hath him engendred, lo Megera is his dame: No God he is, but doth despise, the gods, and hates their name. For godlinesse they nought esteme, that haunt the pots of wyne: Nor well can vse the dronken priest, the Sacraments deuine. What neede I here for to resite, what sicknesse, and what paines: Excesse of meate and to much drinke, doth brede within the vaines? From hence doe flow: euen as it were, from euerlasting spring: The axesse, and the botche, the byle, wyth scaule and scurfe itching. The goute oppressing hands and fete, wyth bleared dropping eyes: Wyth wine the quiuering toyntes they quake. fr? iawes the teeth out flies With sodayne death, &amp; stomacks paine, and fulsome stinking breath: A greater sort than sworde hath slayne, excesse hath done to death. Besydes the goods be straight c?sumde, and downe the guttes do fling: The fielde, the house, the houshold stuffe and euery other thing. And now both poore and base he is, whose riches late were greate: Eate thou, wherby thy lyfe may last, but liue not thou to eate. I haue thee here declared now, the woman what she hight: And now the boy with nodding noule, I wyll thee here resight. The boy is hers, and of her borne, and labour him begat: His name is slepe, his nourse is leth. his fode is poppey fat. He brother germaine is to death, but not as she doth last: He doth refresh the weried limmes, wyth dayly labour past. He doth expell the cares of men, and calleth strength agayne: Without the ayde of him, no man, his life may well sustayne. Yet hurtes he much and doth the minde in certayne wise oppresse: Diseases breedes, and ouls the corps, oft vsed with excesse, If foode be small, he small will be, for when the meate is spent: The corps doth wake or else doth rest, wyth little slepe content, More lightly then his rest he takes, and better sleepes doth breede: But vnto troubled mindes it is, a comfort greate in deede. And much it is to be desired, when loue the hart doth payne: When sicknesse greues or when y? man, doth heauy chaunce sustayne. Then is it more to be estemed: than golde or precious stone: As death, so sleepe doth make the wretch and happy man as one. But he whome nature hath endewed, wyth long and happy dayes: That doth desire expert to be, in euery kinde of wayes. By vertue eke a famous name, in earth for to obtayne: Must watche: for famous things, by sleepe none are perfourmed plaine. And for to sleepe in feathers soft, renowne doth eft refuse: Shun thou this same, with al thy might thy selfe to watching vse. For, O what times of quiet length shall fates permit to thee: When last of all the night shall come and day shall banisht bee. And breath hath left y? quiuering ioints lyke ayre that fleting flyes: With long and euerlasting sleepe, then shalt thou shut thine eyes. While as the goddesse thus did speake, discended downe from hye: Thaumantis, lo when s?ne doth shine that glisters in the skye. With diuers hew that shewes her face, amydde the misty cloude: wyth ruddy rosye purple lippes, thus gan she speake aloude. God spede thee goddesse here on earth, Panomphes gem most deare: Arete chiefe of goddesses (as doth to me appeare.) Come on thy wayes for all the gods, desyreth now to see. Leaue thou the earth, &amp; earthly raignes where dwellers yll they bee. Here is no place for ghostly men, all wycked crimes here raigne: Religion none, no fayth, nor grace but vertue in disdaine. Here foolishe fondenesse holdes y? balle, imperiall Scepter aye: Fraude and disceyt all men amongste, is vsed here alwaye. Go to therefore in hast, as now, breake of thy tale begunne: Let lettes be losed, &amp; with lyke course, let vs to heauen runne. Arete than, beholding mee, these wordes began to say: I cannot now (as faine I woulde) all things to thee display. But when the day againe repayres, and night away shall slyde: To thee, shall I sende one, be gladde, to tell thee all besyde. Farewel therefore: &amp; wyth these words gainewarde the skyes they spring: The westerne wynde did them receiue and vpwarde fast them bring: Lyke as when wicked Scilla flyes, her father following fast: Aloft by little vp she hyes, and he gan after hast. Wyth gredy minde, &amp; through the ayre he sores both here and there: Desiring much to wreke the fault of cutting of hys haire. She striues her selfe in cloudes to hyde, and mounteth out of sight: And Nisus thether perceth fast, that both be out of lyght. Adowne the floudes, doth sunne discend and forth the starres they shinde: And I the way that greyherd led, full sadly then declinde: And home I come, my promist ioyes in heauy hope to finde. Cancer the fourth Booke. O S?ne that with perpetual course about the worlde doest flye: The parent chief of euery thing, and dyamonde of the skye. The Prince of all the Starres, &amp; spring of euerlasting light: Beholding euery thing abroade, whyle as with colour bright. Of crimsyn hew, thou leauest aloofe the brinkes of Persean lande: With rising face, and passing forth, doest hyde thy fyerie brand. Amydde the westerne fluddes, and laste of all, doste burne the hyll: Of Calpe great, and eke that course, frequentest alwayes styll. By thee, doe all things plaine appeare, whole colour late the night Bereft, hir darkenesse by no meanes abyding ones thy lyght. The syght and eye of all the worlde, who partes in foure the yeare, And changest times, &amp; with the time, all things engendred heare: while as by croked line thou runste in lyuely pictured spheare. O starre deuine, and of the gods, o fairest God all hail: We worship thee, and from the hart, wher neuer trothe doth quail. Our prayers here we make to thee, behold vs now therfore: With ioyfull face, and ioyful day, with ioy thy self restore. Disperse the cloudes from hence, and let the day be bright and cleare: Let seas lay downe their roring lokes, straight, when thou doste apeare. Let shipmen safe frequent their course, vpon the waters plaine: Defend the corne, the trees, and vines from pouring shoures of raine. And fr? the boystrous whirlwind mad, and stormy stones of hail: Let pleasaunt aires on vs be blown, from fiery Pyros vail. And make all thinges by thy returne, in quiet rest remayn: O chief defence, and Poets ayde, all hail to thee agayn. Thou fillest the mindes of Poets all, with sacred holy sprite: And mouest the heades of euery one, with sugred verse to wryte. By thee they gain the laurel leafe, and euerlasting fame: Al hayle therfore, and help me now, my singing verse to frame. And succoure these my fyrst attemptes, direct my course withall: Til vnto long desired port, my bote, and I may crall. Thus, whylste at castale sprynges on knees my humble sute declarde: The muses all about me plaste, the God my prayers hard. From towers of Delphos hie he heard, and straight as semde to me: The steple bect, and therewythal a shining light I see. From out the Chauncell came, and eke, a wonderous voyce I heare: Which wyth these words, as then me thought, resounded in mine eare. O yong man voyd of blysse, and whom, such destnies dire do payne: That spendst thy lyfe with bitter yeares pull vp thy hart agayne. For pacient payne doth ouercome, and in thafflicted case: The valeant ought for to despise, the fawning fortunes face. For fortune then doth most preuayle, when that she is restraynde: Doest thou not see, whome fortune oft, had fully once disdaynde. The same wyth changed hand she ayds, and lyfteth vp on hye: Now this, now that: nothing endures, beneath the heauens skye. when glouming weather foule is gone, then pleasaunt dayes ensewe: At length the swelling seas be caulme, that erste the windes so blewe. when winters season sharp departes, apears the floured spring: Fix sure thy minde therefore as nowe, and faynt not in the thing. That bytter seemes: prepare thy selfe, for better destenies: The tyme shall come (the starres aboue, altring their course in skies.) (If death before, thee not destroy) when this thy present name: That now doth lye both drownde &amp; hyd, shall gayne immortall fame. For I my selfe wyll present be, and eke my learned route The Sisters nine, in euery place, shall stand thee round about. And take thee from the common sort, and cause thy name to lyue: For euermore. This aunsweare here, to me did Phebus gyue So praying. But scarce can I the Gods beleue such things of me: Under so crabde aspect of starres, I know my byrth to be. So sore the heauens do me vexe, but yet from thence I go: wyth ioyfull heart I wander forth, alone, and alwayes so. These wordes in minde I muse, O Lord that hap might be: That God or man I might now meete, as promisd late to me. Arete for to send to teach, That I the rest might know: O that from heauens hye shee would, descend the earth belowe. And me with pleasaunt words instruct, as erst I did her heare: A valley long there lay betwene, two hils that bounded neare. A narrow path there was, that shewes the trauayling wight his way: This path I toke, and straight I saw, two shepheardes there that lay. In grasse full grene agaynst the banke, who (bagges and battels downe: with crab tre staues wherw? they walkd) desirous of renowne. Began to striue who best could sing, but iudge they lacked than: Whose sentence shuld the strife appease, and prayse the finer man. As sone as they me present spyde, they both me calde vnto: And wild me for to syt them by, and iudge who best could do. Then one of them, (when that he had wyth oten musicke played) His staring eyes on heauen cast, and on thys sort he sayd. O floure fayre of Dardany, of Ioue beloued (o childe:) That seruest the gods wyth frothing cup of pleasaunt Nectar milde. Come downe from hie now fr? y? Skies, a fayrer far than thee: In earth remayns that vnto Ioue, cupbearer now shall be. Him, Iupiter despising thee, shall take from hence, and place Among the starres from enuy burst, (O thou in wretched case.) Yeld vp for griefe thy wofull goste, but rather not departe: Thou shalt wyth wines the Gods salute, and I enioy my harte. Philetus deare (wythout whose sight, no kinde of thing is swete: To me,) no not my life to haue, wythout his presence mete. As oft as him on horsbacke swift, (the Gote, or Hart to chace:) The Fayries spie, wyth loue they burne and wysh that louely face. Wyth thousand kisses for to mete, as many giftes wythall: And floured garlands trim him giue contending, best who shall. And apples fayre in baskets bring, and grapes of pleasaunt tast: O that neglecting to be pleasd, in him were not so plast. O that this liuelie Impe would shewe, himself alwayes at hand: To ease the wretched louers griefe, then hapiest should I stand. No man in all the world my mate, but he doth cleane despise, My plaints and faithful louers sutes and hates my dolefull cries: And as the shaft from bowe departes so from me fast he flies. But flye not from me thus, nor hate, me so (Philetus deare:) I am no cruell Canniball, wherby thou shouldest me feare. But worthy to be loued I am, perchaunce if thou me knowe: For though vpon my body rough, the hoary haires they growe. And though from chin with locks unk?pt my griesly beard doth fall: I am not yet yll fauoured sure, for beard and bristels all. Be decent eke and mete they be, for fyghting folkes and strong: Let maydly men haue tender skinnes, the sheapheardes all among. In richesse none doth me excell, of beast I lacke no store: A thousand kine my pasture feedes, of swine full fyfty score. Amongst my groue of Okes they runne my kine wyth calues do sway, My lusty gotes wyth kid they swell: ne want I whigge, nor whay: Fresh cheese, and olde inough I haue take what thou likest, away. All mine is thine and I thine owne, though cruel thou denny: If thou me louedst and wouldst thy selfe somtyme come sit me by. I would thee pleasaunt apples get, that hangs on braunches hie: wyth golden sydes like yellow waxe, and red, as strawberies die. I would thy lap wyth fylberts fyll, and nuts of diuers kinde: How oft, how oft mine armes should I, about thy myddle winde? Two thousand kisses would I giue, those rosey lippes of thine: Dout not (swete boy) but walk with me by cleared spring so fine. we both wyll rest, and gratefull sleepe, wyth hausing armes wyll take: Alurde wyth shade of hushing trees, and noyse that riuers make. While Greshops in the heat do chirp, alas, and dost thou now Despise both me and all my giftes, that here to thee I vow? Do not my wofull teares thee moue, nor all that I can say? More fiercer far, than Tiger stout, (whose whelp is tane away.) More deafe than pictures made, of Parus Marble stone: And harder eke than are agayne, the mountaynes euery chone Of Alpes hie, and Diamond strong, what doth thy beauty good: If all men so thou dost despise, wyth fierce and cruell moode? And slayest the soules of woful wightes, whose heartes thine owne be tride: Thus wise her seife in floures fayre, the dreadfull Snake doth hide. And thus wyth poyson hony myxt, lay downe disdayne asyde: A monster vile, and vnto God, is auncient enmy, pryde. Nor he not thou wyth grace begilde, or forme of fading hewe: For beauty lasts but little time, like flower fresh and newe. Full fayre at fyrst, is gone in tyme, while flouring age doth last: while tender skinne in face doth shine, let not in vayne be past Such happy tymes, but vse the giftes, now graunted unto thee: While tyme doth serue, for euery thing, by vse commended be. The tyme shall come when this thy chin wyth bristled beard beset: Shall vggly seeme, and eke thy face, shall riueled wrinkles fret. And when thy golden lockes shal tourne to ghastly gresild heares: To late then shalt thou foble bewayle, the losse of youthfull yeares. And oft thy selfe shalt say, where is my beauty olde now gone? Where is my colour fresh become, both red and white in one? Vayne hope, alas, of this thy face, then shalt thou sore lament: Thy chaunged cheekes, and face so foule thy selfe, when represent, Thou shalt thy glasse perceyue, but why thus waste I winde in vayne? what meane I thus in barren soyle, to let my seedes remayne? Unhappy wretch in vayne I toyle, my destnies will me so: O cruell destenies, that now, so sore agaynst me go. And chiefly now, when wretched loue, hath pearst my wofull hart: Of greater force is lucke in loue, than all the swelling part. Of richesse great, or noble bloud, to destnies vertue thrall: By luck in loue the prince despisde, and Iohn obtaines the ball. But though more fiercer thou remainst, than fearfull raging drake: Or doste my loue no more esteme, than weedes in fenny lake. Yet thee sweete hart I serue, and thee, for euer shall I loue: And nothing shall thee from my minde, (Philetus deare) remoue. This sayd, he held his peace, and thus, this other gan to say: Mellina, passing floure of wheat, and whiter farre away. Than frothing fome of raging seas, or Allablastar stone: And boyled milke, more red than are, the Cherries euery one. when ripe they hang, or Mulbry frute, while yet no blacke they weare: More fayre than trees in time of spring, when braunches blossomes beare. More sweete than are the withred figges or wines that new be made: Such lippes, such brest, or eyes I thinke, dame Uenus neuer had. what should I here commend her thies, or places there that lie? Such partes in practise put, than speake, with better will would I. Not onely here of mortall men, her prayse Mellina gaynes: But Gods her loue I saw my selfe, a Satire take the paynes. To hunt her once, and when he had, the game possest in pawes: Anenst a Corke he taught hir tricks, of wanton louers lawes. She cald and shrikt, and I, as wood, would strayght her ayde haue borne: But sore afrayd I was to meete, the shagheard horsons horne. Nor once I durst my enimy try, his pacience for to proue: How oft she beckes and byds me come, wyth eyes that rowling moue. And of her self she calles me thus, and fast begins to twine: Her armes so white about my necke, like Iuy, or the Uine. That wonted are their neighbor trees, wyth winding course to brace: And fast the wanton bytes my necke, and softly on the face Wyth hand in sport she smites me oft, and by her trouth she sweares: That none on earth but me shee loues, nor none good wyll she beares. But yet am I not such a foole, that I holde this for trewe: For women all in lies excell, and when wyth fawnings newe The naughty queanes begin to fliere, the more thou oughtest afrayd To be, these words in song he spake, and more he would haue sayd. But seuen wolues by chaunce therwith, came creping close the way: From rockes adowne amyd the trees, desirous of their pray. And on the flocke they runne, now these, now those they slea and byte: And mouthes in bloud they stain, againe the masty curres they fyte. Wyth barking boughing noyse, to beat, their enimies from the ground: A noyse full greate made in the dale, wyth roaring cry doth sound. Then both the shepheardes rise in haste, the wager quite vndone: wyth sling, and staues of Oke in hand, togither both they runne. And I, behinde alone remaynd, and forth another way: with doutfull minde and diuers thought I went, as farre as may The brasen canon cast his stone at thrice, and there a spring That spouted vp wyth bubling sandes, where thicke the Plantrees cling I found, and round about the grasse, full grene, it doth embrace, wyth seates of sandy Tophus stone, I gesse it was the place where Fayries set in Sommers rage, when Dogdayes heat doth glowe: Not farre from hence I saw me thought a Seruice tree to growe. Whose fruite did make y? br?ches bend, and therto fast I went: (For ripe I them perceaude,) and some, with hast in hand I hent. And eate them vp, desyring then, with water for to slake: My burning thirst, and to the well, my iourney forth I take. And downe I bowe my self, and there, my lippes in water fyne: I dipt, and whilst I drinke, the stones, in Cristall waters shine. Whilst these are done, a yong m? down from heauens to me sent: That Goddesse good, Arete fayre, of me not negligent. Wyth falling flight he cuttes the ayre, more swifter much he flies: Than haukes that striue by force to take the pray before their eyes. And straight to me he c?mes that then, wyth weary limmes did rest: Amid the grasse he bids god den, then vp my selfe I drest And worship there to him I make. He (passing man in fame) I am did say Aretes sonne Timalphes is my name, My mother hath me hither sent, that al that doth remayne Behinde vntolde, I may disclose to thee in order playne. Then both togither downe we syt, and thus he gan to say. The woman, and hir boy, that stode on left syde yonder way, Thou knowst, my mother told y? plaine: now restes there for to tell What hight the woman, and the boy that on the right hand dwell. Hir Venus men do cal, and say that of the salt sea sud She then created was, when that olde Saturne in the flud Unkinde his fathers stones did cast, so sayd the Greekish sorte: A people fansies fyt to fayne and lies for to reporte. Vranius hir (of troth) begat of Lopades by rape. Vranius syre of euery thing, than whome of larger shape Was Atlas not, nor yet the fierce Enceladus so strong, Nor gorbellied Typhæus huge, nor all the Giants long, That euer earth did yet bring vp. Nine heads him nature toke, Whereof the highest is voyd of eyes, and Westward styll doth loke. Gaynward the East the other stand, aboue a thousand eyes The second hath, and on a peece doth al the rest suffise. His right hand Northward out he casts the left to South he sendes, With both his hands y? world he metes, his feete the flock of fendes Doth touch, his head the skies doth rech, a shepheard rich in deede Aboue al men, of euery flocke through al the earth to feede, He puttes them out, the number would of them excede, if not That monster Pamphagus his sonne with greedy rauening throte Should them deuoure continually wyth Attropos his wife. This Venus now Vranius got, and ioynde in wedlock life To one Pædogenes a God, and bad they should encrease. This is that Venus, wythout whome the vse of earth would cease: And al the world wyth bryers thick vnseemely should be thought. Hir God hath ordeynd, that she myght the losse which nature brought Ful recompence, which God appoynts, that hurtful can not be. What then of them shall I reporte content with chastitie That fayre encrease do not esteme. but voyd of issue die, And leaue no signes of them behinde? they sinne assuredly. And if the truth may here be sayd, vnworthy byrth him giues Nature, of whome not one is borne vnworthy eke he liues By whome another hath no life. Yet they whome sicknesse let, Or other meanes do them constrayne no children for to get, Opprest with cursed pouerty, do feare that they shall see: Their children begge, intend saincts life of whome but fewe there be. Let them refraine, good leaue they haue but many wyl no wyfe, That they may others efte defile, and lead a lechours life. And for bycause that more they might the common sort beguile, Under pretence they giue them selues to sacred things a while, And churches haunt, and priests of God they counted are to be. They diuers lawes &amp; garments strange do vse, and thinke to see The heauens hie with scraped crowne, cleane things the beastes do flye, And after things vncleane they runne, while as the panche they plye, And giue themselues to drowsy reast, which both do foster vice. Stale Uirgins are they thought to be while close they cast the dise, The darke night al in vice to spend, their mindes they whole apply. None truely vse a Uirgins life, but such as come thereby: When croked olde vnlustly age, or sicknesse sore them fret. Or restlesse payne of carking minde: or gift of God then let. Al ouerplus from out the corps doth nature cleane expel. Hereof it c?mes that in night dreames sometimes doth Venus dwel, In dreames that shew the ioyful arte and pleasaunt sporte in deede. Let them more chaste than Sibels be, or Nunnes of Uestal weede. Of two which worthier is I aske estemed for to be, The barraine bowes that frutelesse fade or else the fertile tree? The ground that giueth good encrease, or sand where nothing growes? O thoughts of men of none effect, O fond and foolish vowes, Apply your selues not to despise the sacred natures hest Which wold the bred shuld brede agayn which made such ioyful rest, In wedlock bed thee not to feare, but rather to allure, Why wilt thou nature thus withstand? no hurt in Venus sure There is, if hir thou lawful vse with meane, and not excesse. But to much vsde she strength abates, and drownes the valiantnesse: Destroyes the wit, and shortneth life. Now must we here display dame Venus s?ne whose force doth cause both man and God obay. Who brond withal, and quiuered shafts makes all the world afrayd. To whome (though yet a boy, and blind) hath euery thing obayd, That earth, or sea did euer breede, or heauens hie contayne. O Lord what rage of flames, and fyre in euery place to rayne This boy hath causd? what force haste y? O quiuered Cupide now? No strength thy power may once resist, thy conquest makes to bow Both beast and Man, and Gods aboue, with dartes of thine alone. (His heart through pearcd) full oft hath made the th?dring God to grone: And diuers shapes on him to take hys lightning laide a syde. (And region left of starry skyes) on wretched soile to slide Hath not disdainde, sometime the forme of Egle swift to beare, Sometime, a bull with frowning face, sometimes a shepheards cheare On him to put, sometime to seme a snake, and now, and than With flames to come, in Satirs shape: now golde, now like a swan. Neptunus also once ychanged to fluddes of Enepey, While he poore wretch thy dart did feele with Salmonide he lay. And oft a Dolphin would he seeme, a Ram, or Horse to be. With all the seas he coulde not quenche the flames that burnte by thee, In breast so blinde, and heart of him, a tale to long it were, Like actes of all the Gods, to shewe to thee in order here. How Phebus did a hauke become and eke a Lion kende: Or call to minde the woode attemptes of raging Tartares fende, But vaine it is so time to spende: for if I should expounde The Lordes, and Ladies euerychone, whom cruell loue did wounde, My tale woulde runne to much at large, and downe (before) woulde hide His glistring beames syr Titan bright, the smoking wheeles should slide, Amid the washing westerne waues. But here I thinke it best Such things to haue, sith many men haue plainely them exprest. And now the truth we will declare, this boy did neuer flow From Bacchus raines, as Grece did faine no sure: if it were so, Eche man that hateth wine, should loue but destny him begot: Bicause in euery kinde of loue this destny knittes the knot. All morttall things, this desteny rules: she doth to all bestow Conditions eke with fortune to, and ende of lyfe doth know. Of greater force than beauty is this desteny assurde. Though beauty cause of burning flame hath louers linckes procurde: Of greater might than golde it is though once with golde did bye Olde Saturnes sonne, inclosde in towers with Danæ faire to lie. Familier syght, and licence had full oft to talke, and liue Togither both, when none shall see which sliding way doth giue, By which to loue we in doe come, by which is Venus got. All this can nothing sure preuaile: if destnies fauour not. By destny ioinde, by destny broke, the louers knot, and ring. By this the vile deformed slaue sometimes obtaines the thing, Which rich, nor faire can haue: by this the faire and gentle wyfe Is of hir husbande eft despisde: and more contentes his lyfe A ragged iade, in house to kepe. By this the wife disdaines Hir husbande faire, of gentle bloud and greater ioy sustaines A lither lousy lout to haue, or vnaquainted wight. And if so be that loue were not by Gods aduisement right To euery man appointed here, by limittes parted iust: No doubt of all might one be loued, and on them all should lust, And euery man might safe enioy the Damsel that he likes, But as the fisher doth not take the fishes all in dikes: Nor foulers all the birdes do catch, nor hunters all doe kill, But euery one his chance doth take, obtaines and hath his will, So, loue to euery one is delt by Gods arbitrement. So doth the seruant base full oft his Lady well content. So shall the bursten bleared lout, and crooked father olde A blissefull girle to wyfe obtaine. For as the Marchant bolde, That vnderneth vnhappy starre with wares his ship doth freight, And cuts the fearefull foming seas, is often spoilde of weight By losse of ship, or Pirates fierce: so he that flames wyth loue, The starres, &amp; luck agaynst him both: doth seke the rockes to moue. An euil name, and cruel wound, receyueth he agayne. And efte his loue to get, doth he the losse of lyfe sustayne, But he, whome destnies fauour wel, and fortune smiles vpon, His heart, and ioy may sone obtayne wyth quiet rest anon. But sure of fewe this grace is had, so good are Gods to fewe: Except such one as close doth kepe his ioyes that none them knowe. No trust there is at al in man disceytes are vsed vile, Now euery man doth practise howe his fellow to beguile. If any man vnto his frende his secretes doth disclose. Then must he stande in feare of him least be his frendship lose: Least he in angry moode reueale that erst in harte he hydes If free, therefore thou sekest to be, and safe to liue besydes. Let no man knowe thy secrete deedes: thy frend haue alwayes so While frendship lasts, that thou foresee he once may be thy foe. Which thing in profe hath eft ben knowen, for fewe such frendes we see That alwayes loue: and much herein ought enuy fearde to be. Which euer striues the happy chaunce wyth poyson fell to stayne. Take heede therfore of enuy syrs, I warne you louers playne. Let no man know thy minde in loue, but hide this loue of thine, (If witte thou hast) and let not thou thy fyer forth to shine. A monster vile is enuy sure, a plague that rageth fel, A deadly hurt, than which a worse is hard to finde in Hel. It hunteth vertue in euery place, good dedes asunder teares. Good men-she hates, and doth disdayne the happes of others yeares. Although no man can well kepe close his owne vnfayned loue, If Fates agaynst him let, and nyll the enuious lightes aboue, Smal force in wit of man there is, where Goddes do not agree. In vayne he toyles that seeketh ought, when Gods against him be. Yet ought we not for this to leaue our willes and wittes to strayne: For he that hath the race forth runne, and palme cannot obtayne, Is worthy prayse: and enuy all vpon the Goddes he layes: Who often good men downe haue put, and fooles exalting rayse. A happy man is he to whome, from tower of heauens, grace Is graunted, wh? God guides himself, whose byrth with lucky face The happy starres haue shinde vpon, to him c?mes ioyful loue: And voyd of woe, long swetenesse he wyth pleasant life may proue For loue is daynty, swete, and milde, if destnye cause not payne: Whose dartes, the man that neuer felt, doth senselesse styll remayne. What beast might euer yet be found, that felt not Cupides flame? All creatures vile, and base we see haue tasted of the same: God willing so. Wherfore who seekes this loue, a thing deuine He seekes: for if the king, and Lorde of all the world, should not All things created here retaine in loues assured knot, The world should straight be at an end, and the elements decay. That eche man loues he keepes, and it defendeth eke alway. But no man seekes the thing to kepe that he sets nothing by. Wherfore the order of all things shall last continually. For, euerlasting is the loue of God, that all doth guide. Though all things made do fal and fade, the kindes yet neuer slide. For those the blessed God doth loue, but not the bodies so. Wherof the cruell death hath power, for no man suffreth tho The thing he loues to perishe quite, if he can it defende. But who denies? God all thing can, and he can them defende. But he the bodies doth not loue, wherefore he lettes them die: But not the kindes he so permits from their estate to flie. What doth the potter care if thys, or that hys pot be burst, Turning the wheele, and chalke in hand despiseth now the first? A newer sort of them he makes now ouer all this same. The skye, the grounde, the seas and aire, and raging fiers flame, And eke in fine, the worlde it selfe (by loues enduring knot) So many yeares doth stande and last, for if thys loue were not: The elaments altogither would with bursten bondes go fyght: Nor downe to earth, the Heauens would shewe forth theyr blissefull light, And beames so warme, no seede shoulde growe and eke the fiery flame This aire his neighbor, would c?sume, ne would, but out of frame, His shoures on earth y? aire put downe, full bare would seeme eche soile, The seas should quench the fier quite, or rather fyre boyle, And waste away the fyshy seas, As once, when Phæton rulde not wel the fyry foming beasts, (I dreading sore the monsters hie,) his owne good fathers heastes Beleeuing not, vnhappy wretch was drownd in his desyre. Then al the world therewith began to burne with blasing fyre. Tyll he by force of lightning smytte came tumbling headlong downe, And in the flouds his flames did quench. Loue breedes in euery towne Assured peace, peace worthiest is of al things here we see. In time of peace do al things growe, and al things liuely be. Then liue men safe, in safety eke the trauayling wight he stands, And takes his iourney voyd of harme and scapes the robbers handes Then buzzing Bees in hiues be kept by good aduise and care, And beastes in pastures fat are fed, the ground is torne wyth share, And yeldeth farre encrease in tyme, then plenty beares the sway: In bread, and mylke and noppy drinke, then euery where they play. The sounding shaume doth th? prouoke to daunce, the Thiase round: But idiotes, none do enuy peace, and couet Martiall ground. Such times did flow when Saturn ruld his Empire here alone: O worthy age more worth than Gold, but now O griefe to mone. All things doth discorde vile disturbe, wyth raged mocion mad: And filles and feareth euery place, wyth broyling tumult sad. Nowe fierce we forced are to be, all lawes wyth sworde to slake: The furies al of hel they swarme, a thousand brondes they shake A thousand snakes wythal, and moue the proud hie minded Kings: And common people mad to be, what good to you it brings? (O wretches mad) your death to haste, wyth battes, and bylbowe blade: To late when as she neuer commes, but mischiefe this hath made That plaguy pride and hunger mad, dominion for to haue: O dust, what makes thee proud to be, whose stinking guttes in graue The filthy wormes anone shall teare, why sekest thou for golde? Thinkste thou for euer here to lyue? O wretch, O wretch, behold, How vaine, how short, how fleeteth sone our life before thine eyes? A graue anone shall close contayne, thy bones, and shall suffice. And if so be that loue should knitte, the heartes of men in one: This would not be, for euery man, his frend would tend vpon. And all men for their partes would ayde the frend that they holde deare: Assuredly, nothing more good, nor sweater doth appeare. Than truly while we here do liue, of many loued to be: A safe defence are alwayes frends, agaynst aduersity. The mind in doubtful things they ease, and helpers seke to be: Thy cares and losse they lighten much, they wepe and wayle wyth thee. But seldome perisheth the man, that thus is rich in friendes. When fortune laughes vpon thy lucke, and happy chaunce thee sendes: Wyth thee thy profyts they embrace, wyth thee they ioyful bee: Wyth frendship they thy haps increase, and feast in mirth wyth thee. Who list therefore to leade his life, in safety, and in ioy: Great store of frends for to retayne, let him his care employ. By many meanes this thing is got, which (as I can) I shall Declare: but now to know, is nedefull fyrst of all, Which loue the people call of minde, a motion for to be: For wel to wyl it is the same: that men call loue we see. The mind alwayes it selfe desyres, the good thing for to proue: And seekes the euill for to shunne, these two alone her moue. These two therfore the causes be, and loues assured ground: But good in three deuided is, wherof one parte is found Delighting for to be, the other honest eke appeares: The third vtilitie. So likewise, yll in three we parte, fyrst hurtfull we esteme: The second vile deformed is, the third doth greuous seme. Who so that loues, refusing these, or else desiring those: He loues, loue diuers is, like as the spring from whence it flowes. Not worthy praysed like to be, nor worthy like disprayse: Nor only differ three foresayd, in generall kinde alwayes. But diuers speciall kindes himself, doth eche of these contayne: Which kindes when as they diuers be, make diuers loues agayne. What so euer aydes, that profit is, but is not yet as one: Much goods vpon the body wayght, and much the soule vpon. Strength, beauty, health, actiuity, these foure the body oweth: These things whatsoeuer creature giues from them the profit floweth. Two goods agayne the soule contaynes as maners milde, and Arte: Like as the soule hath vertues two, the will, to whome the parte Of maners all, belong, and minde, to whome the truth to know It proper is, and from the mind, like diuers goods do flow. The learnings nine this minde adourn, which Poets Muses call: Equivalent to circles nine, that roule aboue vs all. The wyll doth diuers goods possesse, of which these foure excell: Wit, iustice eke, and vertue strong, that conquers troubles fell. With her that bridleth eke our mindes, and modesty doth bring: From these, as from the fountayne first do al the other spring. Which whosoeuer seekes to know, let him go tosse the boke: Of Stagerite, or (if he liste) in Platoes workes go loke. Which two are lightes to all the world, whatsoeuer then it be: Such like to vs that giues, that terme may profitable we. As to the body medcine is, and eke the phisick leach: And to the minde the boke likewyse, is mayster that doth teach. But those that profiteth the soule, more profitable be: And better eke bycause it is, of greater dignity. As is the mayster than the man, the shipman than the ship: Than is the cart is he that holdes, the clashing carters whip. But by delay, or out of hand, doth profit vs eche thing: As to the hungred man the golde, and he that golde doth bring. The coke, and eke the fode it selfe, the like I do declare Of pleasing goods in diuers partes, deuided is their share. Of which the body some do please, and some the soule delight: But yet the pleasures of the soule, be alwayes more of might And common eke to Gods, and vs, whereas the bodies ioy: Is graunted vnto brutish beastes, to them a proper toy. Not lawfull vnto them it is, wyth ioyes of soule to mell: Nor haue they all the senses fiue, and only knowe they well. What cast and sense of featling meanes they musick nought esteme: No swete perfumes wyth princely smel, to them doth pleasant seme. Regard they ought the paynted lines, of fine Appelles hand: Or muse they on the brasen plate, of comly Corinthes land? Or wonder they the sight to see, of shooting Circus game? If ought they smel, if tune or syght, them please, it is the same That taste, or feeling makes, as when the Lion fierce doth spye, In fieldes by chaunce a cowe, he leapes, and liftes his maine on hye. And twines and twirls his twisting tail desirous of his pray: Or when the fomey horse beholdes, the gadding mare astray. Wyth hauty head vpheld he runnes, and here and there he kickes: And leapeth hedge and ditch abrode, while lusty guts him prickes. And causeth all the skies aboue, wyth hineying noyse to shrike: When meat therfore, and gendring act, the beastes do chiefest like. And syth to them it proper is, it is therfore most vile: And fit for villaynes to possesse, fyne wyt it doth exile. To often vsde, it body hurtes, who therfore this obayes: Is made a foole and for to serue, is apter eke alwayes. Than ouer others for to rule, but vse them moderately: And if thou minded art to know, the goods of honesty. Remember what before I sayd, for of the minde they bee: The maners milde, and learning eke, as I declard to thee. But giue good eare what I shal say, those goods that do delight While as they last, do pleasant seme, and after of no might. Example for, beholde the ioyes, of song and Uenus play: But that that brings the body good, that profits men do say. The goods therof be pleasant eke, as health obtaynde doth please: So profits it agayne we see, that healeth eche disease. And that that causeth goods of minde, we well may profit name: But these, as sone as they be got, then pleasant are the same. And honest out of hand they be, for all that vertue brings: Doth profit much, and delt her selfe, aboue all other things. She pleaseth most, and honest is, her iust rewarde and hire: Is honour only due to her, therfore who doth desire. Much loue, while he here liues to haue, let eyther him deuise: To please or profyt them he loues, or else in any wyse, Let him haue vertues good in store, the which the dogged sort Shal force and eke constrayne to gyue, a prayse and good report. Whome though they hate yet shall they feare and fyrst of all he must: Of those whome he doth seke to please, marke all the manners iust. For all mens wylles do not agree, nor all their studies one: Such seedes vnlike dame nature sowes, engendring vs vpon. The one doth hate that thother loues, that one doth most disprayse: The other lifts aboue the Skies, wherof appeares alwayes, That eche loue al things not a like, nor al men do desyre: One good that profits, like to haue, nor honest like requyre. Wherfore we fyrst of all must learne, what pleaseth best his brayne: To whome we seke, lest else perchaunce we laboure all in vayne. In doing things of them vnliked, this is not hard to knowe: The talke assuredly declares, the deedes from them that flowe And hidden heart, al men talke most, of that they most do loue: And most attentiue are therto, ful many things that proue. His loue at home may eft be spied, the plowman holdes at home The plow, the goade, the yoke, the rake, the spade to temper lome. The Knight his fearful armour hath, that hangs at home full hie: So he whose house wyth bokes abounds a student rightfully, May demed be: and this I say of euery other man: The hand and tong declares the heart, such things as pleaseth than. Who seketh frendes let him perfourme, for fawning loue doth get: But most men yet do gape for gayne, and all mens hearts are set On gold, and giftes and many frendes, by gyftes obtayned be. But sure such loue endureth not, for when that gayne doth flee: Then fayleth frendship, chiefly then when hope to haue, is gone: But some there be (though few of them) that styll remayne as one. And mindfull eke of frendship shewed, do neuer ceasse to loue: But graunt the vnthankfuls frendshyp fayle, it doth not yet behoue. The good and frendly man to leaue, (who may as rare be found: As Phenix bird in all the world, that breedes in Arabs ground) To profyt many men, and ayde, wyth all his power the same: This way to heauen only leades, by this obtaynd the game Great Hercules, and many more, whose worthy fames remayne: As yet wyth vs, whome neuer age, can cause to die agayne. The gentle and the liberall man, is lyke to God aboue: Great sortes of men agayne there be, delighting things that loue. Wherby such men they most esteme, that pleasant things do bring: And chiefly children, youth, and such as are of greate liuing Do couet ioyes, and pleasures seke, but such loue is not true: For when that pleasure once is gone, then frendships eke adewe. Yet sometymes sure it profyts much, and many get therby: Riches, and many fauour get, therfore let him apply His mind, to please who frendship sekes (so he go not astray: From bondes of right and honesty, but eche man profyt may) And pleasure eke two sundry wayes, by wordes and dede besyde: But safer eke and easier it is, such frendship to prouide By wordes, than dedes, but now tis best for to declare the way: By which it may be brought to passe, which thing perfourme you may. If holsome counsell thou dost giue, and warning hurt declare, And teach how profyt may be got, of euill to beware: In praying Gods to send them helth, and send them well to fare. In askyng gratefull thynges, for them in whome consistes thy care. If thou desyrest any man, with woordes for to delight, Of him, and eke of all his thinges, doe prayses thou resight. And if he euer any acte performed woorthy prayes, Commende it much, for wisemen now, and fooles at all assayes Would praysed be, somtime agayne, with sweet, and pleasant stile Delight that tentiue eares of theirs, prouokyng them to smile. Or tellyng of some pleasant tale, though new, or olde it be (If it be woorth declaryng) tell some woorthy history. If thou perceiuest anythyng that doth his minde delight In any case, disprayse it not, but say the crow is white. And if thy conscience be so straight thou darst not say so much, Then hold thy tong, saye neuer a woord, for now the time is such, That wysdome great it is to fayne, (as true the people say) He cannot liue that knowes not how with both his handes to play. Sometime, beleeue me, now it hurtes the truthe for to defend, The place, the people, and the time in minde doo thou perpend, That nought thee hurte. But some there be that rather loue to prayse A man behinde his backe, and take the same for better wayes. They doo but wel suche kynde of prayse more thanke deserueth sure: Unfayned eke and vnsuspect, it seemes to be more pure. For some doo vse to cosin men when as they present be: True friendes whereby they might be thought, whom when they absent se With bityng words they laugh to scorn, best is it to reiect Such clawyng gestes, it is the vse of Gnatoes fawning sect. Not few again at least, some one such marchant shalt thou finde: That all thynges will abroade declare that issued from thy mynde. Such pratyng mates inow there be he speakes much good (sayth he:) And doth commend your maystership, of him dispraysde you be. In fewe wordes now the truth to say, nothing doth more delight: All kinde of men, than manners good, and life lead all vpright. Of greater force than riches, this, or learning eke it semes: Though euyll men be learnde, or riche, yet no man them estemes. Nothing more odious is, than vice, but if thou honest be: And good, al men shal thee embrace, at least (I think) none thee Wyll hate. A sentence olde it is, that maners lyke in all: And study like is it (they say) that loue is fedde wythall. So merry it is when knaues be mette, so learnd wyth learnd remayne: So haunt al kinde of beastes their herd, I speake not this agayne. For how can they be ioynd in loue, whose mindes contrary bee: When one thing for to wyll and hate, frendes vse it is we see? Loue lastes not longe in wicked men, fooles frendship lastes not long. For priuate wealth that yll men seke by right and eke by wrong. And cruell luste to harme and hurt that yll men all possesse: With pryde, and wrath togither both the frendes of folyshnesse Makes fuming humors rage abrode, and ioynes them by the eares. That onely loue endureth long, whose roote dame vertue beares, Which honesty engendred hath, this onely knittes the hartes: Of godly eke and faithfull men, with loue that neuer partes. And more it is to be estemde, Than is the loue of kinde: By which the father loues the sonne, and eke with louing minde. Eche other kinsmen doe imbrace, for children eftyn hate: Their parentes deare, and fathers eft haue grudgd the childes estate. The brother hath bene sene (er this) to worke the brothers wyle: But neuer true Orestes yet, did Pylades beguile. Nor Pylades Orest to ayde, did death esteme there while. But here it comes in question, if by any meanes we can: Procure the loue of euerychone, the good, and euill man. For loue in many partes disperste is weaker euery howre: In fewe of greater force it is, in two of greatest powre. Deuided thus in many partes it vanisheth away: Who byddes seeke not to many mates, doe therefore truely saye. For harde it is to liue among so great a companye: With them as it doth frendes become, eke conuersant to be. For fyxed fayth denyes her selfe, with many for to dwell: With fewe her selfe she doth content, wherfore beleue thou well. Thou shalt not many faithfull finde, loue not in any wyse: The common sort: nor seeke their loue, for discorde thence doth ryse. And pleasant peace with fewe remains, the common prease forsake: Of pressing men with troubles, they their troublous name doe take. A fewe, and good choose thou thy selfe, with whom to leade thy lyfe: By many yeares in safe thou maiste, and also voide of strife. Lyke as therefore, thou canst not loue, so many feruently: So, canst thou not of such a sort, be loued faithfully. For who so loueth not for troth, is worthy of no loue: A ciuill common loue there is, wherewith it doth behoue. The common sorte to loue, with which eche good, and euill man: We ought assuredly to loue, which is perfourmed than. When as we no mans hurt procure by wordes, or else by actes: When as we leade our lyfe that none may well controll our factes. When we to all men curteyse be, and eke with frendly face: Doe them salute with honours dewe, and praysing them imbrace. But yet, at fyrst it doth behoue with fewe to leade thy life: If thou doste seeke in peace to liue, and flye from foolishe strife: Them chiefly shun whom nought thou knowes: it can not be perdye. That we in thornes, and thistles treade. and scape vnprickt thereby: Nor care thou not a whyt, if that the wicked loue not thee: Thinke it ynough if he not hate, ne shalt thou hated bee. If thou from them doe stande aloofe, such hurteth not the snake. But if, sometime it doth thee please the company to take. Of tag, and rag, and neighbor Iohn, let tongue in silence dwell: And take good heede what thing y? saist, and alwaies harken well. And seldome speake, it is the signe of one, whose head is lyght: So much to prate, he oft offendes that so doth wordes resight. But such as rare, and wysely speake, deserue the chiefest praise: And in the prudent mouth it is a goodly gift alwayes. Speake yll of none behinde their backe, ne yet before their face: Let thys the chiefest warning bee, and rule of chiefest place. Nor prate not thou to no intent, nor ydle wordes let fall: For then shall eche man laugh at thee, and eke a foole thee call If thou shalt aunswere any man, or if thou question finde: Before thou speakest in any case, recorde it in thy minde For when if once is fledde from thee, thou canst it not retaine: The worde that once is flowne abrode, can not come home againe A goodly thing, also it is in talke to tell sometime: The pithy sense of aged lawes, and auncient poets time. And now and then examples sounde in worthy stories olde: Do giue the talke a greater grace if they alude, so tolde. Alwayes therfore, it nedefull is on diuers bookes to reede: And, as the Bees now there now here, on sondry floures to feede. Expell thou anger farre from thee away with pride that elfe: Such kinde of men cannot be loued, and alwayes shewe thy selfe. Of gentyll minde, and lowly eke, so shalt thou all men please: If any man thy hurt procure, proue thou, hym to appease. Rather with wyt, than furious mode, to wit doth strength giue place: She conqueresse doth all things tame the Tigres stout in pace. And Lyons fierce by art are wonne: and ships in seas doe swim: And towers stronge by art doth beare the Oliphant on him. By this the Bull doth beare the yoke and horse with spouting might: By this constrained is to beare, the bridle, and the knight. Wit all things rules with aide of force, to threaten much wyth crackes, Is cowardes guise, &amp; womens strength to men belongeth factes. The wyse man doth dissemble hurt, the valeant prates no whitte, But when he sees the time then dare he doe that shall seeme fytte. First take good heede that none y? hurt, and if by iniury. Thou harmed art, when thou seest time reuenge it rightfully. If thou canst not let griefe a while within thy heart remaine, Least that by foolishe bosting wordes, thou maist more harme sustaine: It is naughty playing with edged toles the wyse man will refraine: And spie hys time, and eke giue place his foe with wordes to traine. That pleasant seme, and fawnings eke till he him bring to snare: So winnes the wilde vnrulye colte the witty horseman ware. So on the Oxens necke the yokes, the plowman putteth on: So Lyons fierce the Charret drawes that Cibell syttes vpon. So (tigres wood) you doe obey to Bachus bridell raines. Great wit it is to conquer thus, and hide the inwarde paines. Lyll time conuenient come, therefore this must be markt beside. Whersoeuer thou remainest, let not thy mouth be stretched to wide, With laughings loude, but wh? nede is then laugh thou moderately: It doth declare a simple wit, to laugh excessiuely. And on the other side, it is not fyt for any man: Alwayes in dumpes to be, therfore flie thou them both, and than. The middle kepe, there vertue sits, no gester would I thee: And yet, if that thou canst, I would that pleasant thou shouldst bee. Enough (me thinkes) I haue now said, my message here doth ende: For which, to thee, my mother mee from heauen hie did sende. Now time c?maundes to leaue y? earth, and skies aboue to clime: From whence I wonted am the earth, to se full many a time. Musing that it so little semes, and rounde as any ball: Amid the aire to see it hang, hauing no stay at all. Sustainde only with his poise. the sea doth eke appere About the earth full serpent lyke to crangle heere and there. And like a little brooke to runne, here eke I doe beholde. The Padus Tanais, Ganges and that Histre waters colde. As oft as showers do cause the dikes with wet to ouerflowe: And when thy mouthes alofe I see (O Nilus then I trowe) They be (though great in dede they are) but seauen gutters small. And hence I vewe the bloudy broyles with shining swordes that fall. And fieldes be sprent with purple bloud, And foolishe kings therby: Who (while they couet more to haue and neuer thinke to die.) With dire debate do battailes bring the giltlesse soules to kill: And shew the Gods a gasing griefe repugnant to their will. And there I se their places change both riuers, springs, and flouds Hils fall to dales, and dales to hils, and place (where once grewe woods) With coulter tilde, and wheras plowes before haue runne their race, Theyr woodes to growe, transformed towns and al things changing place. He blessed is that may the like prospect to this obtaine: Where Asia, and Affricke he may see, and Europ eke againe. That swels with wealth, &amp; wepons eke, and diuers nations strong: That there do dwell, wh? Cancer burns the Ethiops them among. Cilicians fierce, and Tartars turkes and men of Scithians grounde. The shoting Parthes, Arabians eke where franckinsence is founde. The Thracians wylde, and Arimaspes those valiant men in fight: The french, the Italian, men of Spain the dreadfull Englishe wight. As many people more beside, on whom the sunne doth shine, While he aboue, or vnder goes, the horisontall line. Wouldes thou not hither wyll to come, if it might lawfull bee, For any mortall man to doe: if body let not thee. But this can hap to none, but vs whose bodies framed were: Of finest aire, and not of earth, a while therefore forbeare. Till death thy soule shall lose fr? bonds, and tyll that time a dewe, I go, this said, and aunswering I away from me he flewe. In haste he flies wyth swifter course than windes themselues my thought And spreading winges abrode the skies wyth course againe he cought. The fithe Booke entituled Leo. I seeke not here Arabians wealth, nor stones of value hie: That redde seas breede, ne golden sandes in Tagus streames that lie. Nor people proude to gouerne here with sceptred hande and mace: Such things my lucke hath me denyed, nor once I waile the case. That desteny hath not giuen me such, so euen the nought as good: May like obtaine to reape the golde of wealthy richesse floud. Full oft we see thunworthy heds of witlesse people crownde: Whose bodies eke are trim bedeckt with robes of purple rownde. Those things I woulde the Lorde of all, on mee would here bestow: Which neither fooles nor wicked men may euer hap to know. That makes a perfect man in deede and nere to sainctes aboue: O mighty Ioue what is the cause, or what should thee thus moue, Wisedome to none or fewe to geue? in euery place we see: Both pleasant, faire, and lustye brutes, and wealthy men to bee. But vneth may the place be founde, in all the worlde so wyde: That bringeth forth such any one in whom doth wyt abide. Dost thou perch?ce more worthy think, a guide of fooles to bee: More noble is that power, vnder the which more noble be. For worthyer it is assertainly to rule by force of powers: Both castels stronge, and fortresses wyth large and ample towers, Than Lorde of folde and flocke to be, and droues of beastes to guide: Perhaps thou dost it to that ende our doings to deride. And makest man thy laughing stocke, for nothing else to be: The life of men on earth doth seme the staged comedie. And as the Ape that counterfeits, to vs doth laughter moue: So we likewyse doe cause and moue the sainctes to laugh aboue. As oft as stately steps we treade with looke of proude disdaine: As oft as richesse we to much doe craue or honors graine. As oft as we like Saunder snuffe, our selues doe bragge and boste. What lesse is it, what part is played, when holding honors most. With sceptred hande, a crowned owle an Asse of stature faire: Of them beholden is to syt a loft in stately chaire. Despising euery other man though he be like in case: Desiring yet to heare the sounde, of God preserue your grace. And to be duckd and knelde vnto and haue them kisse his feete, Nor seeth the mad man what he is how vaine and apt to fleete: Like water bleb and thistle doune, that flieth in euery place: I am no such, nor seeke I doe to liue in such a case. But you O Gods aboue that dwell, and blessed are alone: That liue in euerlasting ioy, if case you thinke vppon. The cries of mortall sinners here and if you not despise. The humane prayers that we poure, and teares of wretched eyes: I you beseche to graunt me here, a pure and perfet minde, By which the truthe I alwayes may from falshode aptly finde. And vertue eke from vice discerne least I as voide of wit, Should flie the things y? I should haunt and follow things vnfit. For if so be it may pertaine to any mortall man: To liue as thus in blessed case, by this meanes thinke I than. That I may blessed be. But sure I am therin deceaued: And with me also are all these that haue the same beleued. For no man euer happy was nor euer yet shalbe: Not though the goddes of all the worlde in hand possessed he. Nor though he did in wit excell. but some perchance will doubt: Except my leaues by reason strong do boult the matter out. Marke thou therfore this present booke that sekest this to know: According as they best can doe my verses thee shall show, Your sacred dores (my muses sweete) set wide and open heere: To mee your Prophet and refreshe my minde with waters cleere. Of Parnas hilles, which sore I thyrst: disclose your secrete wayes. Shewe me the truth, for well you know what hath bene done in dayes. Of alder time, and presently, and what shall eke ensue: Now fyrst of all I will declare, with name and not vntrue. Whom we ought happy for to call, then will I touche the thing: Whereto the God Appollo hie, by wisedome shall me bring. I say therfore that only hee can haue the name of blest Who hath the chiefest good in hande now presently possest. But all men this not truely knowe when eche one best doth deeme: The thing y? most his minde doth please, the asse doth more esteeme. And mule, the barley graine, than birt that deinty dishe of meate: Than fleshe of tender thrushes sod, than loynes of Hares to eate. So golde the gredy snudge doth wish, and alwayes prayse for best: Which honors thinks thambitious man and milksop, Uenus nest. Howe fewe alas the truth may know, what myst of errours blinde: Our iudgements hide, bycause that few haue now a perfect minde? Eche man doth iudge, &amp; ech man speakes according to his wyll: Of their own selues som things ar good which neuer can be yll And neuer harme, so good there are, not of themselues that bee: Which somtyme help and eke besyde, do somtyme harme we see. These are the bodies outward giftes, vse makes them good or nought: As if a man his countrey saue, by strength, this strength is thought Then good to be, but if he harme, the giltlesse innocent: And wyth this strength his co?trey wast then now incontinent, This strength shall co?ted be for ill, like sentence I declare: Of riches, honors, eke of rule and all thinges els that are. The owner eft suche goodes destroy, although he vse them well: So hurtes the Bees their hony sweete, so makes the Beuer yell. His hoysting waxe, like riuers streame, they fade and fleete beside: And doubtfully in errour passe, and neuer certayne byde. Not therfore they be chiefest goods, nor who so doth abound: Wyth such may counted be to haue, a happy life then found. But rather if the truth be sayd, those goods vnperfect be: which vnto vs do profyt bring, and hurt in like degree. For else might poyson good be iudgd, that sometime health vs bringes: And nothing should be counted yll, among all worldly things. When as nothing so hurtfull is, but sometyme helpes agayne: But those that of themselues be good, and alwayes good remayne. Doth make the happy man in dede, but what these goods now be: All men knowes not, wyth reason sharp, therfore them seke must we. Minerua graunting grace, and some, these things perchaunce wyll say: Is nothing hard to know, syth them, both chaunce and corpes denay. Then must they nedes be good of minde that makes vs blest alone: This bolt of theirs is well bestowed, but mark they haue touchd none. First must we common thinges declare, our purpose shew that may: Like as the torch amid the darke, doth shew the gadlings way. worke, working, or the man that workes in euery kinde of thing: The work it selfe an end we graunt, and him as beginning That works we take the middle eke the working for to bee: Now which of these more worthy is, becommeth vs to see. Ech thing that moues doth farre excell, the moued thing therby: This playne apears, the end doth moue the workman certaynly. For what is he takes ought in hand, but he before perpend: And in his minde do ful conceaue, therof the finall end? The end therfore more noble is, that working eke besyde: Is much more base than is the end, by reason like is tryde. Hereof we must coniecture needes, the chiefest good to bee: A certayne end, but euery end, is not of best degree. But only that which is the ende, of euery other ende: To which the other ends haue all recourse as flouds descend. Togyther all in roaring seas, for reason would that so: Unto the sure and perfect thing, thunperfect things shuld go. And for to come to better state, bycause it is more base: No otherwyse could wel be kept, good order in this case. That thing therfore that is the last, and end of all the rest: That nedes must be the perfectst good, the chiefest and the best. Agayne of euery kinde of thing, contaynde in compasse round: Of all the world some hauing lyfe, some voyd of lyfe be found. But those that life retayne, excell the bodies lyfe wythout: Then whatsoeuer is chiefest good, must liue ensewes no dout. Of things that liue, some reason want, and haue no speach to vse: The rest haue speach and reason both, and them we best do chuse. The chiefest good therfore hath speach, and reason perfect tride: Of those that reason haue, great part, their liues in pleasure slide. And parte agayne their liues consume, in labours great and payne: But of them both their state is best, that pleasant life retayne. We must nedes (Ergo) thinke the life, of chiefest good, most swete: Of those that liue most pleasauntly, some parte away do flete In little tyme, and some agayne, remayne for longer dayes: They that continue longest age, their state for best we prayse. The longest time therfore doth liue, the chiefest good of all: Whom thundring Ioue &amp; great Iehoue wont mortal men to cal. He shakes wyth fearfull noyse y? flames, and flashing lightnings fell: Black storms he sends w? th?ders roare he makes the skies to yell. Unbindes the blasts and sets them forth that makes the seas to roare: That driues the foming flouds w? force, vnto the ratling shore. And shakes enclosde in caues the earth, wherby commes tumbling downe: The buildings byg of euery bowre, and strength of euery towne. But some perchaunce do doubt if God, whome we chief good do call: An end may be, syth we haue told before that end of all A framed thing must be, and here, this end to haue we say: Beginning and a midst thereto, which all men wyl denay. He alwayes was and styll shall lyue, no end to him can be: All things he made, and of no man, was euer framed he. Before him nothing could be seene, nothing can after bide: This doubt wyth answer for to loose, loe thus I do prouide. The workman fyrst and maker here of all the world and all Things in the same contayned clere this same we God do call. The end of all the world likewyse, and all thing in the same: Him God that guides the stars aboue, him god we also name. Yet lawfull therfore is it not, a worke to thinke this same. For euery end is not a work, his minde that works doth frame, Sekes not the work alone to make, but farther doth intend: As he that frames a chest doth not his paynes and labour spend The chest alone to make, but for some other cause it frame, As somthing for to kepe therein, or else to sell the same. More worthie euer is the ende the later it doth fall: And worser things to better driue, so God is ende of all. To whome eche eyther thing contendes, for whom the world doth stand: And all things eke therein that be, and for himselfe his hand Created al, and not for vs, as some syr Iohns do say, That call and bawle in euery church, and lead pore soules astray. Wyth words they doltes of Dawcockes make what cause, what wit of ours? What noblenesse, what goodnesse is contaynd wythin our powrs. For which the world so vast shuld frame so great a prince as he: We all are full of fylthy vice, and fooles we also be. Scarce one in all the world there is, whom poyson doth not try: Of greedy scraping auarice, or fylthy lechery. Whom swelling pryde doth neuer vexe, whome yre or pleasure blinde: Doth not throw hedl?g down, why then what goodnesse can we finde In vs, or what desertes, that might so great a workman moue: The skies, the seas, the fruteful earth, to frame for our behoue? Loues not he gentle vndeserude? so thou perchaunce wylt say: This is but fond, for who wyll loue, the vnthankful wretch alway? But he that wit doth lacke besyde, whose natures disagree So much, what meanes, or how may loue betwene them be? For God himself all tymes surmounts, in whome no end is spyde Nor neuer he beginning had, yet end of all besyde. And fyrst begynning eke he is, most chiefe omnipotent, Aboue all things, than whome more good can no mans head inuent: Or yet a Lord of greater power, or one more excellent Who hath no nede of any thing, yet all things nede his might: Who eche doth beholde, and yet not subiect to our sight. Contayning all good things in him, and voyd of eche ill deede: We contrary as misers borne, of vile and fylthy seede, To wayling woes and dolefull teares, and thousand daungers dyre: Continually wyth these or those, diseases set on fyre. But little tyme remayning here, and that in griefe and payne: Alas in what all errors myst, our liues we here do trayne? Howe eche one weake of minde we be, wyth diuers chaunces dolde: Lamenting this, and wayling that, in fraud and vices bolde. Who after that we waded haue, through cares and carking thought: Are here compeld this life to yeld, resolued sone to nought. The distance vs betwene and God, this (ergo) doth declare: More great to be, than if we should the seely flea compare Unto the mighty Elephant, what knot of amity: Can knit these two good gestes in one. that so vnequall be? Thinkst thou thys flea may haue y? loue, of this same monster strong: Wyth like doth loue and concord dwell, and eke th' vnlike among Alwayes doth hate and discord raine, smal fayth at least, with them ther is, Hereby some sorte appeare, (whom men prophane, our law do iudge and they that cowles do weare Call hereticks) account vs mad, and doltheads vs do call: Bicause we hope the Skies to see, and liue the Gods wythall. For euermore in happy life, wyth diuers other toyes: Which folish minde and prating tong, do promise vs as ioyes. For speach doth make vs beastes excell, wher if we lackd the same: Which God vs giues, &amp; eke our handes, by which we all things frame. No beast more vile than we were then, no beast in worser case: For these two aboue the rest, giues nature all her grace. Hereof doth all our pride arise, thereof eche Arte begonne, For voyce doth warne the present, what to doe or what to shonne. And letters to the absent speake, for if a beast might show: By wordes the secret motions hid, in heart that he doth know. If talke among them might be had, if that their fyngers fyne: were apt to write, no doubt we might beholde an Asse sometime Of greater wit than we: and beastes of euery other kinde: would greater reason haue in them than man in vs may finde. And boldely durst themselues preferre, eche other wight before: And eke the Asse would proue himselfe, of estimation more Than vs, the tongue and hande therfore, not reason causeth thus: Eche other kinde of beast to be, a Subiect vnto vs This they affirme and more besyde, if men be borne they say: Of parents dumme, whose handes are maimde or cut from them away. And liue in woddes not nere to townes, and tongue and hand doe faile, Like other beastes: (I pray thee) what can humaine wit preuaile? what reason shall in them apeare, thinkest thou they will not leade: Their liues as vile as other beastes? what wisedome may they pleade. More than the reast of brutishe sort, one sprite they al possesse Though it vnlike doe seme to be, bicause they doe expresse. In body diuers forme and haue of great diuersitie: Their membres all wherto is ioynde a diuers facultie. If diuers Carpenters you bring like learned in their feat: If some of them lack instruments, no doubt the diffrence great Must needes amongst them be, for they can nothing do: That want eche kinde of tole that doth belong their worke vnto. Nor after him shall Orpheus draw, the beastes and rockes so hie: If he shoulde lacke his musicke sweete, ne once would Paris flie (Being armed wel at euery poynt) vnarmed fierce Achill: Wyth such a sorte of reasons vile, these fooles our eares do fyll. But more of them perchaunce I wyl, hereafter bring to light: When I shall of the soule of man, some sentences resight. For there I wyl it proue deuine, immortal eke to be: which two of beasts no man wil graunt, now where we stayd wil we The chiefe and perfect good is God, and who so him possest: May called be of euery man, the happiest man and blest. But who can him obtayne to haue, for eche thing had as yet: Is farre more vile than he that hath obtayned it to get. And euery kind of thing possest, is eke of value lesse: Than is the owner of the same, that then doth it possesse. For euen as sone thou mayst contayne, the Occean sea as wel: Wythin the compasse of a dish, or of an Oyster shel. (O candle set before the windes, O subiect dust to graue) Than Lord of such a mighty power, by any meanes to haue. Alone God al things doth possesse, and hath himselfe alone: He only hath the happy life, besyde him blest is none. Acertayne chiefest good there is, besyde this same foresayd: Which euery creature may obtayne, yet like to them denayd. For diuers natures all they haue, some one thing this doth please: Some other thing doth seeme agayne, to be the others ease. Al thing therfore may well obtayne, a certayne happinesse: If not so perfectly a God, himself doth it possesse. But by some meanes, and for a tyme, while things that doth agree, Wyth nature best, he can obtayne, ne feeles aduersitie. But (al things past) now time requires, that we should speake of man: Who hath the chiefest good in hand, and counted happy than, When seeming vnto nature good, he all things doth possesse: And feeles in all his life no harme nor kinde of bytternesse. This may be counted chiefest good, that all good things contaynes: That giues all kinde of pleasant things, that puts away al paynes. For only pleasure doth not make, nor vertue yet doth giue: The happy life, as some do write, in ground of Grece that liue. Sith many goods of greater worth, than fewe, are counted playne: As is the bushel counted more, than one pore seely grayne. One good thing giues not happinesse, though it be chiefe and best: But one in all that makes the lyfe, compact in all the rest. So can not only one that rules, a towne procure to stand: So can not of a thombe be framde, a full and perfect hand. And syth that of two partes we are, the body and the minde: Then happinesse the happy man, in both these partes must finde. He must be whole, and sound in Corps, and of a lusty might, He must be fayre, he must be fresh, and of a liuely spright, He must be good, wise, learnd, discrete, and gifts of both retayne, Pore life not know, nor hurtful cha?ce, and if he not remayne In long estate of happy yeares, yet blest can he not be Though al the same commodities foresayd to him agree. For happy life that doth not last almost is worth nothing, As well haue certayne sayd before, not one day makes the spring, Ne bringeth it on Swallowes swaps. But at his latest day With easy death and smallest payne must he depart away, And passe with ioy the Stygian lakes resolude from mortal dayes, Nor in his life time glory wantes nor at his death his prayse. But may there any one be found with vs that mortal are, Which hath al these things in his time? I think him very rare, To whome nothing disyrde is lackt, nor doleful chaunce doth light, In al his time and yeares, who liues and dyes in happy plight. This is the very Phœnix byrd whome dust the Grecian fayne, The Grecian of a foolish head, and of a frantick brayne: Who thought of one might yssue come, and bones consumde that be To ashes colde, a byrd to breede which neuer men could see. But so that she may wonders sing this nation not esteames The truth to say, a nation whole addict to toyes and dreames. At whose example Latines dote, the happy man therfore Is rare as Phœnix byrd. But we are al both lesse and more In wretched case, although yet some than some more misers be, Bicause that like estate to al is not, nor like degree. He that therfore doth most good things and euil least sustayne, May counted be a happy man: but he whome cares do payne, And fewe good things at al possesse, may called be ful wel A wretched man, syth none therfore is happy, we must tel How least vnhappy we may be and how in better case Our liues to leade in greater ioy, and with more pleasaunt grace, And to begin I not beleue it true that al men prate How Bishops great and mighty Kings do liue in best estate. For as in euery other thing extremity is thought But il to be, the meane as good, so here excesse is nought In riches, for to much of eche doth hurt, who hath therfore Most riches, hath no better life, than he that most is pore. With euils like they vexed be. so he that is to fatte, And hath his pa?ch wyth guts bumbast not lighter is for that, Nor soner moues than doth the wretch whose skinne doth leannesse fret: The one doth feblenesse forbid the other fatnesse let. And as the Seas with greater floudes, and foming force doth yell, And casts himselfe in mountaynes hie while he discouers Hell, Amid the deapth the tempest roares and yet doth least appere. Is moued most with raging windes, but now the shoare ful nere The shallow Seas with louder noyse doth bounce vpon the sand: So Kings that haue the power and rule of realmes in hand, With greater cares tormented are, and greater griefes of minde, Although the common people yet, these wo?ds doe neuer finde. For secretly within their heartes their torments they do hide, Adde this thereto, they alwayes haue a mischeus mate beside That vexeth them, and feare it is suspecting euery twigge, Hereof sometime do treasons breede sometyme a Spanish figge. They dare not walke alone, nor eate except it tasted be. More deare than any kinde of price O worthy libertie, The chiefest Gem, and Iewel fayre which taken once away, Be swete, and pleasant vnto men, nothing inuented may: And death it is alyue to be. The pore and seely soule, Where as he list both night and day in safety may go proule, Eyther wythin the Cities wall, their places fayre to see, And playes beholde, or view the signes of olde antiquity, Of if his pleasure rather be without the wall to walke, In Orchards fayre, and gardens gay, amyd the floures to stalke, Or if desire of countrey sight remayne within his hart, Nothing him lets but may alone when he seeth tyme depart. He needes no shuffling sorte of men, nor croude of clientes thicke. As oft besyde as he doth thirst or hunger doth him pricke Apace he falles thereto, nor feare of poyson doth him let. For baser foode the byrdes abrode in woods had rather get: And greater pleasure farre they take in pecking seedes wyth payne, Than if a cage of pearle and gold their bodies should contayne: And there be fed with daynty meates. Full oft a king therefore May liue in wretched case no doubt, nor makes him happy more (Beleue me now) his regal crowne. But on the outward show The fooles do gase, and what within remaynes they little know. For I him count in best estate whome Fortune giues a meane Whose liuing doth not much exceede nor substance is to leane, Who hath himselfe a prety house to which doth ground belong That giues his master malt and wheat and other grayne among O what a great and goodly gayne the ground wel tillde doth breede The husbandman that labours wel of few things stands in neede. For eyther trees of diuers kindes a long in order set, With little cost on them bestowde do greatest profyt get, Or sundry sortes of fruteful grayne and Corne in furrowes cast With great encrease c?mes vp agayne, Of if to labour fast It pleaseth him in Orchards fayre, of whose increase doth spring Such pleasant frutes that may c?pare wyth dish of any king: Except one list rather excede than reasonably to lyue. The meane estate therefore is best which eyther chaunce doth giue, Or dead mens wil, or dowry of wife, or trauayle of the hand, Or cast of minde by marchandise to fetch from land to land, In breding beastes, with cattels heird, thy stables ful to driue, In keping doues on houses hie, or honied Bees in hiue. Or winter milles black oyles to grinde, or milles that meale do make, With these and diuers other meanes sufficient gayne to take Doth wisdome teach such as qiue not their mindes to slouthfulnesse, Nor suffer ill and poyson swete of drousy lazinesse. But chiefly yet this is the gift of lady Fortunes grace, She setteth whome she wil aloft in rich and welthy case. She lady is of euery thing and riches all doth gyue. It is not to be sought besyde in seruice for to lyue, For nothing more an honest man becommes than liberty But he of nature is a slaue and of no dignity, Unhappy rather, and a wretch, who can the yoke sustayne Of masters hestes, and them obey for hope of foolish gayne. The meddowes fat, nor all the Golde nor price of Indian sandes, Is so much worth that thou shuldst haue thy meate in others hands, And rest at others wil, and when thy master byds thee go, Then like a ball from him thou must be tossed to and fro: And serue a man perhaps more worse than thou thy selfe sometime, An Asse, vnlearnde, a surfetter that vowes his yeares to wine. A fond and filthy thing it is, when thou mayst leade thy life With little liuing safe and free and voyd of al such strife To beare the yoke of bondage vile for hope of greater gayne And freedome sel, the chiefe of all and stately checke sustayne. O mindes of men degenerate why seeke ye great mens halls To be an honour vnto them and make your selues as thralls? Wo worth you all that shepherdes nede like beastes of brutish sorte, That of your selues not able be to kepe an honest porte. For who so serues by any meanes can no wayes happy be, It is an Asses parte to beare the saddle styl we see. Therefore who c?mes of parents free, or of a noble kinde, And doth possesse as much as may suffise himself to finde He nedelesse then his chaunce bewayles But some perchaunce wyl doubt The maried or the single life which best of them, for stout And proud the wiues are often seene, and oft to chide and brall, And catch their husbands by the pates, and often naught wythall: Besides the cares of children vexe whome grieues the sicknesse rage Or else vntimely death doth take, the daughter come to age With monied bagges a mate requires, or else Dame Lais schole Doth practise there, and stayns y? house, the sonne proues oft a foole Limfingred oft, and harlots kepes, a brawling merchant stout, A swearing Gose, a Ruffian wilde, a vile vnshamefast lout. He seemes not to be free besyde who so euer hath a wife, Must alter needes condicions al, and leaue his youthful life, Forsaking frayes must byde at home, not ryde from towne to towne, Nor in the night time walke the stretes in beating dores adowne, And keping Ione. Its nedeful then to liue aduisedly, And see thy goods they not decrease but may augmented be, Least in thy age the wallet come. Although these things be so, Yet think I sure with maried bed and nature for to go More better farre, as she to vs of birdes and beastes vntame Example shewes, how both the kindes themselues togither frame, And ioyne in one of duty must, and alwayes so remayne Encrease to get and nourish vp their yong wyth equal payne. Whereby the kinde may styll endure and neuer more decay, For we as euery kinde of beast are moued to Venus play By natures wyll, a worser thing shall hap to thee be sure If thou thy selfe wilt neuer seeke this thing for to procure. And voyd of issue shalt thou dye and yeld thy corps agayne, A straunger then shall haue thy goodes for which thou tokest payne. And when that aged hayres shall hap and sicknesse shall thee hent, Who shall thy wearied age relieue? who shal thy hurtes lament? Thy brother or thy kinsman nere, or wil do this thy frende? No sure, for to be heire to thee they rather wish thine ende. On thee aliue they wayt and fawne thy goods at graue to take, And eche man loues and fears thy good of thee no force they make. O mischief great, O beastlinesse, and vile desire to get, O piteous plague eche where disperst on profit all be set The vertue left. Who seketh now the righteous thing to vse? What man is he that wil not now al goodnesse cleane refuse If any hope of gayne he haue? Golde guydes the lawes we see, And might of Gold than str?gth of blud of greater force to be. For Gold both shamefastnesse and faith are set abrode to sell, For Gold the Gods aboue be serude and we set free from Hell. But now the wife hir father leaues and mother deare besyde, With al hir house and houshold frends, with thee alone to byde For euermore both night and day, and of thy seede she beares A sweete and goddly golpowlde Boy of small and tender yeares: And kindred now to thee she brings and doth thy house enlarge And helpes thee eke in euery thing and takes wyth the thy charge. Betwene you al things common are both good and euil things, Whatsoeuer harmeth one hurts both, and that which profit brings Unto the one, that profits both. If sycknesse make thee weake Or greater age, then doth she strayght exhorte thee wel and speake. She comfortes thee, she helps thee then, she neuer leaues thee there, She watches thee and watching serues. Likewyse thy children dere With al the meanes they can they kepe for both your blouds are one, And Image like: And when the day wherein thou must be gone Is come, thou art not cleane extinct but shalt aliue remayne In them who then shal represent their fathers face agayne. But some there be that rather had in common harlots bed Uncertayne children get, therfore they list not wiues to wed. Such kinde of men I can not prayse nor wise I haue them thought, For wife wyth dowry helpes thee well where harlots bring thee nought. A wife doth bring thee store of frendes, where harlots bring thee foes, A wife thou shalt in safety haue, a hore wyth griefe and woes. The one wil trusty styll remayne, the other false alway, And fearing to be cast at large she stealeth al she may. And for hir selfe the heapes vp all hir state for to repaire When thou hast pluckt hir belles away and cast hir vp to aire. More, if thou kepest a hore, thy goods are but in queasy case, Of wiues are children lawful got, of harlots bastards base. To wed therfore it needeful is but fyttest fyrst to see The maydes estate, the parents eke their manners what they be. For oftentimes the children do their parents after take, For trees according as they are like frutes are wont to make. Aske counsel of hir neighbours, close (so that she faythfull be) And if thou hast a woman send hir whole estate to see: If she be fayre, if she be fowle, if she be sore to knowe If she lacke wyt, if she can spinne, if she can knit or sowe. These are the workes for them to vse and vertuous womens deedes, For to eschewe all ydlenesse, which chiefly vices breedes. For ydlenesse the minde corrupts and leades it vnto euil, To wanton lust and filthy vice, and fansies of the Deuil. This ydlenesse doth ouerthrowe and Cities downe doth pul. For if that Lucresse had not giuen hir self to workes of wul, And if the chaste Penelopey which webs had neuer wrought, But both amyd their halles had syt with ydle wanton thought: This might haue pleasd perch?ce am?g a thousand woers one, And of the others Uirgin death should neuer fame haue gone: But best it is for thee to viewe these things thy selfe alone. For other men among (for troth) firme fayth remayneth none. For al men now wyl faine and lye, and truth is quite exilde: Few faythful shalt thou find, but if thou wilt not be beguilde. If thou wouldst al things better proue, then make thy selfe a spye: And seeke al things thou goest about, to see wyth present eye. Wherfore I warne thee earnestly, take hede that thou her see: (If that thou canst) what one she is, to whom thou thinkst to be In mariage ioynde, least afterward, in vayne thou dost lament: And least it doe when tyme is past, thee of thy dede repent. But if perchaunce (as eft it happes) thou liuest in wretched case: Wyth wicked wyfe deceyude by fate, and frowning Iunoes grace. Fyrst mildly doe such one exhort, swete words wyth her frequent: And giue her gyfts, and all that may, her wayward minde content: Wyth swete deceyts her ouercome, now fast thy armes embrace About her neck, and though shee shun, cast kysses on hir face. With all sweete meanes apease hir yre. if this doe not preuayle, Use bytter wordes, be angry then and chyde hir fast, and rayle, Put on thy brasen face, and fume and feare hir then with threttes. If this doe nought procure, and by thy wordes she nothing settes, Trye thou the matter then with stripes and softly on the backe With bouncing blowes behast hir well that all hir bones may cracke. If thou suspect thy wife of play, then kepe no lusty men, Nor fellowes fayre, with whom she may be prating now and then. Thou art deceaued, if thou dost thinke that any kinde of man Wyll faythfull be, in Uenus case no men are faithfull than. For she reioyseth to beguile. by fraude is loue possest And vnto Uenus alwayes fraude a thing is counted best. But as a chiefest thing take heede there entre not thy dore No fryer fatte, ne lusty Monke, nor priest of any lore. Eschewe the knaues, a greater plague than these can none expresse, These are the dregges of euery sort and springes of folishenesse, The common synke of mischiefes all, and Wolues in felles of sheepe, For pence and no deuocion sure to God these wretches creepe. And with a colour false of truth they symple soules beguile. And vnderneath religious cloke a thousande mischiefes vile. A thousande haynous deedes they doe deflouring mayde and wyfe, Whore hunters vile, and Sodomites the seruaunts all their lyfe. Of beastlinesse, and belly ioye, the things diuine they sell, What wonders great inuent they not? what dreames doe they not tell? The common people to deceiue and to procure againe. Hereof doth superstition ryse and thousande fansyes vaine. Which if the gods be wyse they scorne, and do refuse to vewe: The Godly man doth worship God, wyth earnest loue and trewe. And not for gold, away wyth gayne, thou shalt see them denie: All sacred seruice here on earth, and God himself on hie. Th?selues therfore this flock doth serue, and not the saincts aboue: And profit causeth Gods to be, which if thou once remoue, Both temples and their altare stones, shall flat lie on the ground: Nor any more amongst them al, shall any God be found. These iuggling mates and foxes false, expell from thee therfore: And take good hede that none of them, do enter at thy dore. Least thou do cry the Cuckoes note, through fayned vertue such: Nor if thou any gossyps hast, beleue them not to much. For vnder colour of this name, the Knaues do many play: Take heede besyde that from thy house, she often do not stray. Nor let her haunt thy neyghbors house, it hath bene sene ful oft: That whoremasters haue hid th? selues, amyd thy neighbours loft. Appoynt her mates for company, of chast and honest fame: Let mother Bee, be put from thence, and euery bawdy dame. And seeke thou not wyth other whores, thy selfe for to relieue: Nothing doth cause her more to frowne nor nothing more her grieue. For nothing more reuengement seekes, than when she is begilde: And sees that wyth vnstedfast loue, her bed is thus defilde. Then all wyth ire she flames and hates, then doth she eke begin: To work her housband like despite, then choller boyles wythin. Then rageth shee like Bacchus priest, whom to much wine doth prick: Beleue me well she is but rare, that doth not vse the trick, That harlots vse, when that she is, deceyude of lawfull part: At least if she can not in dede, yet synnes she in hir heart. For will with vice prouoked thus in vice will farther slide. But if thou takst hir with the deede let lawes on hir be tride. Be not ashamed but let the lawes be reuerencde of thee, For they are as a certaine rule by which we guided bee. Least thou shouldst giue a greater paine amid thy raging yre (Offending God, in felowing men) than doth the fault require. For common people neuer vse the rule of reason sage, But are seducde with furies fell like beastes of brainles rage. Ne hast thou lost thy liberty by marrying of a wyfe Bicause thou maist not walke y? stretes and leade a ruffians lyfe. This can be calde no liberty but rather licence nought Who so is free doth seeme to serue such is not to be sought. It bringes the owner to much harme, and not to can doe ill, Is better farre than haue such vice adherent to thy will. How many men haue bene destroide by to much liberty? How many men in safety liue with bridles dost thou se? And if thy children sicknesse vexe why shouldst thou weepe or waile Go seeke in hast to make them whole if that will not preuaile And if that death will haue them needes then vse a pacient minde Thou art not in this case alone but fellowes shalt thou finde. The griefe that we with many beare we better may sustaine. We all are borne to this intent to render lyfe againe. For of our fyrst beginning doth the fatall ende depende And certaine is the time decreed for all away to wende. And either sone or latter doth eche man his graue descende To death which is of euils all the last and finall ende. Not of the valiaunt to be fearde. what doth it ought auaile: The deathes of them with teares, y? here haue lost their lyfe to wayle. Is it a thing so wretched here, to leaue this foolishe life: To ryd thereby our mortall corps from all vnquiet strife. And for the hurly burly here, eternall lyfe to win: Perpetuall reast by death we gaine, or eke the comming in. To lyfe againe, but weepe thy fill, in time thy teares shall staye: And all thy cares and griefe besyde, from thee shall time conuaye. But if thou wanton children keepe, or of a greater shame: O father fonde deseruing stripes, then thou art most to blame. And causer chiefe of all their hurt, who taughtst not them to know: Both maners good and vertuousnesse, while tender yeares did grow. Not yet with vices foule defaced, neglecting thou the minde: Didst only bring their bodies vp, like beastes of brutishe kinde. Hereof so many foolish geese, and noughty men remaine: With whom eche citie pestred is, for all in age retaine. The maners that they did receiue when yonger yeares were rife: And eche man as he liued in youth, so leadeth he his life. The tender twigge at first may bowe according to thy minde: But when the bowes get elder strength no more thou shalt them winde. Nor from the place that yong it helde, thou shalt it cause to flye: So doth a childe in tender yeares, eche way himselfe applye. But when that elder age is come, looke which way first he went: That kepes he still, and will not change his first conceiude intent. Of custome long is nature bred and yeldes hir force alway: To vse that long time hath bene kept. yet ought we for to pray. To God, within the mothers wombe that he may giue good seede: For so we shew our selues in lyfe, as wee therin doe breede Whosoeuer doth come nought fr? th?ce will seldome vertuous proue Though manners good, the schole hym teach and thousande masters moue. Well maist thou nature rule sometime, but neuer hir expell For she is still of greater force than all thy guiding well. Yet somthing will she altred be with vse and daily toyle: So with continuall husbanding doth beare the barren soyle. So Lions fierce of mighty force obey to man as king. So by continuall exercise eche Arte in time doth spring. Wherefore instruct thy children well while tender yeares doe grow And teach them honest wayes to walke and vertuous lyfe to know. Permit them not to rampe abrode according to their will, Than liberty no kinde of thing for children is more ill. If thou be wyse holde fast thy raynes and warely well them guide For mortall things by natures force are moude in vice to slide. And willingly thereto they run if helpe no labour bring For without Arte is nature wone to giue no perfect thing. For God himselfe will not permit that we with slouthfulnesse Should heauy waxe, but stirres vs vp with cares and busynesse: And as with spurres the slothfull pricks a pleasaunt place ther lies That ryseth vp with craggey rocke amid the steamy skies, Full of delight than which more blest a place can not be founde To whom the sweete Elysius fields and Temp, of Thessale grounde Doth place resigne, here nigh the pole and night the starres that shine, Dame vertue dwels, and there enioyes a thousande pleasures fyne. But vengeance crabbed is the pathes both narrow and vnplaine And so be grown wyth thickes of thorne that neuer can attaine. The vile and slouthfull minde to passe of earthly cares possest: And few pure minde a loft doth bring, whom God hath chose as blest. Aboue to dwell amid the skyes, full crabbed is the way: To vertue sure, but plaine to vice, by which we sone doe stray. To which we all runne easely, who therefore doth intende: To trade a childe in vertuousnesse, must labour him to mende, For without labour nothing good, can well perfourmed bee: The force of daily labour doth, all things dispatch we see. First ought you fathers to take heede, aboue all other things: Your children haunt no ill resort, for custome alwayes brings. Eche kinde of manners vnto men, yea though they sainctes should be: Ill company will them corrupt, but chiefely let them flie. From haunt of lustye youthfull brutes, for youth is alwayes bent: To vices all, and filthy be, all filthy talke inuent. For wholly is this age addicte, to naughty ryots deede: That they vse not the haunt therefore, of yong men take good heede. Thou that intendest for to kepe. a childe in vertuousnesse: Now vse to chide, and now the rod, and plaine the way expresse. By which they may their feete direct, in no wyse fauour showe: And euer angry, let them not, the loue of Fathers know. For nothing can more hurtful be, than speake them faire vnto: Then greater heart in vice they take then all things dare they doe. When thou for truthe shalte take theyr wordes and makst of them to much: Bewitched sore with doting loue, to children fauour such Is hurtefull sure, for feare alone, doth make them vice to fly: Not reason then, and sone they synne, if they be not put by. With brydels harde, and as they doe full oft in vices fall: None causyng them, so seldome they returne if none doe call. According as they bring them vp so all men children haue. Besyde all this we must inuent our bodyes health to saue. For health is far more worth than golde the healthy deluing loute In better state accounted is than crased kyng no doute First ought the cause be know? wherof such sicknesse vile are sowne, In corps of men, tormenting them for once the causes knowne. More easely mayst thou shun theffects and causes pulde away, The effectes of them that did ensue incontinent decay. The causer first of each disease is chiefest nature sure, As oft as vnder naughty starres the byrth she doth procure: While as the childe doth inwarde take the motions of the skye Or else begot of naughty seede. the cause doth eften lye. Amyd the parentes of the childe, when they perfourme the acte Disposed ill, with naughty bloud, or sore diseases racte More causes are there yet beside as labour toyle and rest, Both colde, &amp; heat, with slepe, and meat, and ioyes of Uenus nest. Eache one of these, doth strength abate and hurt the liuely sprite, As oft as we vse them to much or vse them else to lyght. Excesse of both doth sicknesse bring of measure health proceedes The perturbations of the minde diseases often breedes. And to much sadnesse, feare and griefe and to much myrth as well Doth kyll if we will credit such as hystories doe tell. The ayre doth hurt, the water harmes when they be both infected. Hereof doth come the plaguie sore whereby the guttes are vexed. The common rot doth many kyll, and diuers sicknesse sore Doth brawling, fight, and fawle procure with thousande perryls more. These springs &amp; gro?ds of mischiefes all (if thou thy health set by:) By all the meanes thou canst inuent, seeke thou from them to flye. If thou be syck as nedes thou must sometyme, what wilt thou doe? Desyre not then the medcine long, but loke thou sone thereto. While as thy sore is yet but grene, nor yet thy mortall fo: Possessed hath his fixed place, amyd thy corps to goe. A little water doth suffice, to quench the breeding fyre: But when that it is fully growne, and flames begin to spyre. Wyth vaunting course agayn y? starres scarce riuer, spring, or lake Will then suffice to quench it out, shift therefore timely make. To know the cause of thy disease, and sone to put them out Use contraryes, contrary things, eche one expell no doubt. If cold haue thus procurde thy harme, vse things to heate agayne: If trauayle, toyle, or meate thee hurt, from them likewyse refrayne. If nede require then seeke the aide of some Phisitians hand: Or Surgians helpe in Surgians Arte, more knowledge sure doth stand. For playne and sure appeares the work, that in his hand he takes: But Leache, whom we Phisitian name while he the water shakes. Wherby he doth his iudgement giue, and feeles the beating vayne: And rakes the dung, he is deceaude, and doth deceaue agayne. But wyth vnlike estate of harme, the simple soule doth die: And giues the balde religious men, a cause to sing and crie. The other hauing gotten golde, accuseth God on hie: And sayth that he was onely cause, wherby the man did die. And fast wyth siluer stuffes his purse, wyth sweete reioicing hart: All men (alas) are healed now, by chaunce and not by Arte. For he that any Arte knowes well, in practising of it: But seldome he doth chaunce to erre, or doth offend no whitte. But these among whereof we talke, amongst a hundred yll: There scarce is one whom they can saue or whome they do not kyll. How chaunceth this? But for bycause, that fewe of them doth knowe: What thing they do, what Phisicke is, but while they seeke to flowe. Wyth wytty words, and Logiks Arte, the vnlearned sort to binde: Of Phisiks cure the principles, they scarcely seke to finde. Instructed thus wyth nedelesse Artes, themselues they homewards hie: And fast wyth Ergo there they prate, and bygge they looke therby. Hereby they stipendes do require, and thinke inough the same: (Nor are they here deceyude) for this, that wyth an honest name They may be murderers of men, O lawes of wretched kinde: That can permit such mischiefs great, O Kings and rulers blinde. That spye not thys deformed thing, O you that guide and rayne: Permit not such a wickednesse, chase hence this plague agayne. And succour bring to mortall kinde, by these same murdring knaues: How many men both night and day, haue found their fatall graues? Let them haue perfectly their Arte, or let them not professe: For other artes if they do erre, the harme of them is lesse. But this except it perfect be, is full of perilles greate: And priuily doth rage as doth at home the plaguy heate. It is not good therfore to truste, such men, whose learning stands: In precious habite to be seene, and to adourne their hands Wyth rings and hoopes, and precious stones, but this that I shall tell: Wherby thou mayst thy selfe retayne, in minde reserue thou well. See that thy diet holsome be, and eate not thou to much: For mischiefe great hath come to men, by ouer feeding such. Hereof do most diseases breede, beware especially: As of a poyson strong that doth, enforce the corps to dye. That thou no meate agayne do take. till that receiued last: Be well consumed and perfectly, his full digestion past. And euery day vse exercise, by pace or other feate: Wherby thy ioynts thus moued may, procure a warming heate. For mouing is the cause of warmth, and aydes the stomack well: Encreaseth strength, &amp; humors nought, from out the flesh expell. Breake not beside thy quiet rest, for sleepe the body feedes: And helps the mind wher harme to both, excessiue watching breedes. Expell thou sorrow farre from thee, and heauinesse exile: For it dries vp the sinowes all, and makes the body vile. And gresled haires vntimely plants, the ioyfull heart agayne: Doth make thy limmes &amp; m?bers str?g, and youthfull yeares retayne. The other things beholde thy selfe, that erst I tolde to thee: A thing more precious farre there is, by which we happy bee. And like to Gods, and heauens haunt, in earth remayning here: Although his grace to fewe is giuen, fewe worthy do appere. Such honour hie for to possesse, and if to know the same: Thy minde desyres, I wyll thee tell, dame wisdome is her name. This is the greatest good of all. than this of greater grace: The Gods can giue nothing to man, to this resigneth place All that that breedes in red sea sandes, or all the golden goodes: That Tagus keepes, that Hermus hath or in Pactolus flouds. Whatsoeuer growes if truth be sayd, to her no Princely raygne: May be comparde, she is the Mo- ther of all Godly trayne, And greatest vertue is. O blest, yea blest, and blest agayne, As much as mortall man can be, is he that doth obtayne Of God, this goodly gyft to get, but some perchaunce wyll seeke: What wysdome is to knowe, and sure the troth hereof to speake. Nought else but knowledge chefe shee is by which the pured minde: Whom neither mortal waight doth pres nor earthly thought can blinde. Doth scale and clime the skies aboue, and there in ayry place: Wyth God doth dwel, despising here, all things in mortall case As vayne, ascending alwayes vp, much like the flames of fyre: Regarding light these earthly things doth things aboue desire. And doth discerne the good from yll, and truth from falsehode nought: And things of blind and mortall men, that chiefest here are thought. As pleasures, realmes, and riches great wyth hie triumphing geare: For which both night and day they toyle esteming not a heare. Bewayls the vayn and fading thoughts declaring here the way: Of liuing well in order iust, and eke the dying day. The rest among the wiseman shines, as doth the sunne full bright: Amid the starres, and doth despise, the force of fortunes might. And vnderneath his fete doth treade, eche harme wyth constant minde: Nor moued is besyde wyth feare, or dread of death vnkinde. Nor feareth once the paynes of Hell, but takes wyth myrth his graue: And laughes to scorne the fansies fond, that common people haue. Not douting here this lyfe to leaue, repleate wyth wretchednesse: And ful of toyles hereby to get, eternall quietnesse. In fine he equall is to Ioue, to him adherent be Four things: For wel he counsel giues, and clearly iudgeth he. All error quite from him remoude, he guideth also right: Both humaine things and eke deuine, are subiect to his sight. This last that I haue here rehearst, is chiefest of all the rest: Than which there is no greater thing, that here may be possest. But no man can this wisedome haue, tyll cleane he purged bee: From euery haynous vice and crime, and all iniquitie. For wisedome doth deny to dwell, amyd the sinfull hart: And hateth eke the mindes vnpure, sith she is purest parte. And no man can this wisedome haue, except he be discreate: And learned be in many Artes, know these to be the feate, Wyth which is wisedome free obtaynd, wherof I would say more: But time commaundes me here to shut, and end this booke before. My Lions tale hath long enough, continued here hir stile: Wherfore my muse now hold thy peace, and rest thy self a while. Virgo the sixt Booke. Some I beleue of cancred minde, and of malicious face: Who thinke they only know the troth and only haue the grace Al doutful things wyth iudgem?t right, and knowledge full to trie: Wil say I neuer tasted yet, the blessed springs that lie In Aone fieldes, nor sacred flouds, that Phocidos doth frame: Nor that the Laurell leafe I doe deserue, nor Poets name. Bycause I write not fansies fond, and monsters maruellous: And fayning not deceyue the eares, of such as credit vs. For they suppose the Poets parte, is only lies to tell: As if it were a thing to vile, for them wyth troth to mell And lawfull not. their iudgements I, accompt both naught and vayne: And sweeter semeth farre to me, the truth for to retayne. To aged wiues and witlesse boyes, such trifles I betake: Some barke abrode the battels big, that Giauntes great did make. With Gorgons grim, and Harpies vile, and mighty Ciclops wilde: And shipmen sore enflamde with song, of plesaunt mermaides milde. with Circes old that monstrous hag, and beastes that thre heds weares: Chymera vile, and Atlas strong, whose mighty shoulders beares. The starry skies, ichangd to rocke, that cloudes hath forrowed eft: with Persea hie, and Tantalus, Promotheus wretched theft. And Tittus stout, and Belides, and what so euer more: The doting grece hath Latins taught, in long time here tofore. I wish not I, so much to drincke, of Aganippes streames: Nor seke I so the Laurel leafe, of glistring Phebus beames. with Iuey leaues the hears to decke, wherby I so might fain: A poet thus to be I blush, and am ashamed plain. If nedes we must suche trifles wright, and vse suche pleasaunt lies Troth thus despisde: of many toung is had, but few are wise. Beleue me well: and many wright, with hauty verses hie: And many haue the Grecians toung, and latin perfectly. And while so many thinges they know their wisdome is but thin: With regal wordes theyr stile is dekt, but small effect within. The outward Image only shewes, and picture light we spy: But what good thing remains therin? what frute is had therby? What learneth he that readeth them? what knowledge hath he got? But dreames and folish fansies fond, that life here profit not. which for to know, and not to know, is all of one effect: Though they me Poet call or not, I wil not yet neglect. The troth to say, and lies to shunne, truthe makes the perfect minde: which who so euer most doth know, approcheth niste the kinde Of saintes aboue, and happiest is, although the folishnesse: Of people rude him not commend, nor prayse his worthinesse. Nor fauour him as he deserues, nor titles of him tel: wherefore my muses now approch, and Sicophants farewel. Behold, I enter now the way, which with a lothsome shade: The Cipresse and the Yeutree hides, with leaues that neuer fade. The doleful fieldes and darksome raign of Proserpine I see: wherein the Letheus riuer runs, with streames that darkned be. Amid the poyson fieldes abrode, doth slepy Popey spring: On silent shores, Calliopey wherto dost thou me bring? what monsters for to se dost thou, commaund? what noyse to harke? with doleful noyse of irksome Owles, soundes al the wodes so darke. The Howlats cry with woful tunes and loud lamenting noyse, O muse, whereto dost thou me bring? behold, with wailing voyce. The hilles and valleis all do roar, and Eccho back doth beat: The mourning times, an answer giues, what grief is this so great? what is the cause of mischief such, what kinde of people those: That all be cladde in mourning blacks and wailing vesture goes? what men are they that thus in blacke, with weping fil the skies? Alas, what sight of bodies slain, lie here before mine eies? what hath here causde this bloudy broyl? who made this slaughter fel? How many kinges and bishops bones lye here? I know them wel. Is yen same death aloofe that comes with bloudy sithe in hand? with dredful face, and ghastley looke before whose face doth stand. A thousand heapes of sicknesses, a thousand daungers eake: O armed with to fierce a gard, my thinckes I hear him speake. with clamoure great as he doth come, to him I wil geue eare: And what I hard wyth all my hart, I wil declare them heare. That death I am that with my sythe, right downe do cut like hay: All thinges that liue vpon the earth, the rule and eke the sway. Of all the world, hath Ioue me delt, and biddes me none to spare: But hie and low, to flea and kil, them downe with equal share. wherby may none escape my handes, not one can flie from me: The hauty heds of mighty kings, by me suppressed be. The pride and pompe of prelates flour, I cause a downe to fall: No kinde of creature here doth liue, but vnto vs is thrall. Although he (flying) pearse the partes, of northern Boreas ground: And passe the ragged Riphean rockes, yet shall mine ire be found. And he my power and stroke shal fele, or though he do descend: The southern parts, wher shineth bright the starres to vs vnkend. Yet there he shall me surely finde, and finding me shall die: My sithe, both East, and west doth kill, I set not richesse by. How many men hath this my hand, downe cast from state on hie: And hedlong shoued with mortal might, in darksome graue to lie? I wel remember Priam once, when slaine at altare stone: He sacrificed was to me, the guid of Macedone. The proud, with fighting hand that put, so many realmes to flight: To whom no like could then be found, by force and deadly might. Of this my dart, in Babilon, sore wounded downe did fall: what should I here the Latine Lordes, and Mars his neuewes call To minde, the Lordes of all the earth, whose valeant vertue plaine: Did ioyne theyr rule to Ocean seas, and fame with starres to raine? Could I not when me list all these, islaine to hel throw downe? Depriude theyr hands of scepters stout theyr heades of regall crowne. Of wordes their mouthes, of sight theyr eyes, of mouing members all: And eke their bodies thus destroyde, in filthy graue let fall. Me feares the Ind, the Arabian, the more, the Scithian fel: All they whom Asy and Europe kepes, in Affricke all that dwel. Both kinde and place are one to me, nor times obserue I than, Nor maners way, nor yeares esteame, the good and euil man. The wise the foolish dolt shall die, the little sucking Will: The yong and old, the fayre and foule, with reason like I kil. And he that yonder I do se, approching to my land: when as his destenies permit, shall feale my deadly hand These fearful words with hellish mouth, this churlish thief out brayed: wherwith my senses all did fayl, and I remaind affrayd. My bloud therwith forsoke the vaines, and left the outward part: And shrouded close within my brest to succour there my heart: But chiefely when this fearefull fiende had sent the plagues of Hell To them that ranged on the earth amid the croude to dwell, Which knew not of that mischief great, then forth abrode they fly And here and there they catche and take eche one they can come by. Then bodies sicke on grounde are laide and deepe for paine they grone, And many there with Sythe in hande doth death dispatch alone: And passing forth she did reserue till slaughter next begunne, The liues of all whom Lachesis not yet had fully spunne. Thus trembling all my ioints therwith and all amased then My selfe vnto gan saye these wordes: O cares, O vowes of men O labours vaine, deceiuing hope, O fleeting ioyes of minde, O time that euermore dost chaunge, O fading humaine kinde, How vayne and how vncertayne is thys transitory life? How subiect vnto euery harme of thousand euils rife? Which outward shewes a pleasant face both swete and framed wel, But inward, O what gall, what griefe, what poyson there doth dwel? What are we wretches here but dust, with winde and rayne vpcast? And like the brittle breaking glasse and shaddowes fading fast? Much like to Roses that doe shewe a gorgeous gaudy face When sunne doth rise, &amp; when the night apears do lose their grace. To day wyth myrth aliue, and foode to wormes wythin a while, This day in fayre and lusty plight, and straight a Carrian vile. Alas what doth it vs auayle to hourd vp heapes of Gold And plate to haue, and clothing riche and Gems of price to holde, Great realmes &amp; cities strong to guide, in houses fayre to lye Aloft to loke, and think himselfe ful like to Gods on hye? If death do al things take from hence if we like smoke or dust As wretches fade, if that so sone our pride, our pompe and lust Do passe, and end for euermore? as I these wordes had sayd With whispring voyce my selfe vnto beholding al afrayd With quaking pace this Ghastly fiend: syr Orpheus mother deare, Why art thou thus she sayth afeard? be bolde and of good cheare, For feare is signe of beastly minde, vnfyt for men is such, What is the cause that shuld thee moue to feare this death so much? Then aunswered I: Good Lady mine nature doth force me so, What liuing beast hir not abhors and seekes from hir to go? Shee takes from vs both life and goods delightes and al at ones The corps to nought resolues, for what remaines but dust and bones, Which bones in tyme returne to dust? in fine all goodly things Shee here from vs doth take away and chiefest mischiefe brings. Whom would not therfore such a beast and vgley Monster feare Except his heart were made of steele? Then Ioue hys daughter deare With smiling lippes began to say thou runst beyonde the white, And art deceiude with forme of truth and shadow of that light. It is not easy for eche one the truth it selfe to know, Thys is the selfe same bowe that doth amid the great woode grow With trees of order thick embracde, that misty errors hide, Nor euer might thys golden twig of many men be spide, But onely vnto them to whom the milke white Doues it show, But I of seede celestiall borne the truth doe fully knowe: And can it well to thee declare if thou to here require. I aunswerde then: Good lady sure I nothing more desyre: We must depart from hence quoth shee come after me a while. And forth she leades, not far from thence where Phebus hye did smyle, With beating beames vpon the hill, whose pleasant shining light Did put the misty cloudes abrode and darknesse all to flight. Besyde a spring we both face downe and vnder Laurell shade Begins my guide with pleasaunt voice, and thus hir wordes she made: An Ape (quoth she) and iesting stock is man to God in skye, As oft as he doth trust his wit to much, presuming hie, Dare searche the things of nature hid his secretes for to speake, when as in very deede his minde is dull and all to weake. If he be ignorant of things that lye before his feete How thinkst thou those things shal he se which God and nature sweete Within their bosomes close haue hyd? yet al at fingers endes This hasty blinde vnhappy foole persuade himselfe he kendes, So much himself he beares in hand of al your folishnesse The spring and chiefe this selfeloue is, A darknesse great that causeth you, to knowe the truth the lesse. Away with this, and better things thine eyes shal quickly spy, And those that erst for good y? thoughtst thou shalt for good deny, And those that euil now thou thinkest thou wilt not euill trowe, This darknesse from thy minde expeld. I wil therefore thou know, That mortall state is nothing else but blathers full of winde, which here and there on rolling bal enforceth fortune blinde, To whome if any wytte they had should death more welcome be Than life, syth liuing here all men wyth harmes oppressed be: And fewe good things they here do vse not full of bytternesse which true I thinke thou wilt beleue when I shall here expresse The goods and ylles of mortall life as briefly as I may. These two conferd the humaine life we playnly shall display. What thing it is, and whither death ought so much fearde to be. But fyrst of riches wyll we speake which euery land we see Doth prayse, doth seeke, doth wonder at and couet instantly: I wil endeuour them to blase. Good Lady then quoth I If it you please, this labour spare for once and long agoe This lesson learnde I perfectly, Minerua taught me thoe, Now forward shew some other case, not things foreknowen retel. The whole estate of pleasure to Arete tolde me well, So dyd hir sonne Timalphes eke let this thoe passed be Therfore, and then declare at large what else it pleaseth thee. Then aunswered she, of noblenesse I somthing here wyll say, For that is one of chiefest goodes, and at this present day Al men do seke this same to haue and think they it obtayne Although as farre from it they be as is the Spaniard playne Remoued from the man of Inde. But what is noblenesse? Of value what? the truth I do intend for to expresse. But what auayleth it as nowe the truth of ought to say Syth no man wil it nowe beleue syth al men it denay? Some kinde of beastes doe flye and hate continually the light, And rouing styll amyd the darke do wander eke by night. So, many neyther can, nor loue the light of truth to finde. For God with nature so deuides the state of mortall kinde, That vnto him that sees aright, the state of man alone Doth seme to blase the nature full of other beasts eche one. So diuers are the thoughtes of man, and so vnlike they be, For many still pursue the darke and truth can neuer see, And on the Sunne do alwayes loke wyth watrish winking eyes, A few with open sight it vewe whose minde is of the Skies. Nobillity therefore as doth the common people say, In heapes of riches doth consist, or in the Golden sway, Or else in bloud, as oft as he bred vp of gentle like, Of Belsiers, and of Grandfathers can brag and armes define, And can his valeant parents prayse: this iudgement I refuse, For styll the common people lye as they were wont to vse. A like opinion many haue, but fewe haue reason playne. If he should be a Gentleman that riches doth obtayne, Why then good Gentlemen may be the Sowters and their feares, The Butchar, Barber, Fishmongers, and he that horses reares, The shepheard, and Iack Baker, and the Tanner with his hide, The Baud, the Thefe, the Grafter and other all beside Of fylthy sorte, for them among ful many riches haue And many may, for fortune ofte extolles the wretched slaue, And often she doth throwe a downe with hir vnequal hand Such as of late she did permitte aloft on whele to stand. At that tyme only Marius was therfore, in noble state When as a victorer he came within the Romaines gate (The Counsel and the Commons al reioycing much thereat,) With crowne of Bayes, &amp; horses whyte ydrawne on Chariot sat, But after that from thence expelde, by wicked Syllæs might, A banisht man to Minturne fled lay hid, and wanted light In dungeon vile, or when he was constraynd to beg his bread In Africke land, (O lawes of Gods O powers to little dread,) And bread most apt for ditchers tough: was not this noble man A wretch as now? from him aloofe fled noblenesse as than And strayghtwayes she did eke returne when Marius came agayne By lot of chaunged starre to Rome: their sentence sure is vayne, If noble state consist in golde, of earth doth Golde procede Of fraud, of stealth, of Usery, we ergo then do spede Of noblenesse by fraude and stealth, and eke by Usery, O iudgement blinde of common sort of reason cleane wythout, No Golde can make your noble men no riches thus can cloute, For worthier is nobillity than any precious good, With golde it is not bought nor solde. But some now bragge of bloud, And prayses of their kindred prate while they most wicked be, And of their parents actes they tell and olde antiquity, Of Grandsirs dedes, and bloudy spoyle of Unckles winning ground, And though y? slouthful beasts th?selues wyth thousand crimes abound, And vertue lacke, yet are they thought good Gentlemen to be, Bycause they come of auncient bloud, and noble auncestrie. Why bragst thou thus with others acts and talkst thy Parents prayse, When as thou art a shame to them that liude in alder dayes? The Crowe a Swan would seeme to be and eke the prating Rooke, Wyth Pecockes feathers false ystolne would like a Pecocke loke, But nature doth forbyd, which is the spring of noblenesse. Hereof comes beastly mindes &amp; mindes addict to Godlinesse, Of hir procedeth euery kinde. The body causeth not Thee for to be a Gentleman but minde procureth that. For many Clownes haue bodies bigge of fayre and lusty state, An ornament is noblenesse to minde appropriate, And certaine force of nature bredde which mighty things and hie, Desyreth still, and things of base estate settes nothing by, By which the minde doth striue aloft lyke fiery flame to ryse, And lyke the Herne, to pearce the clouds and baser things despise. whosoeuer can this strength obtaine by gift and force deuine He shall be good and painefull eke, of powre in counsell fine, And toyle sustaine something to doe that shall seeme worthy prayse, That he himselfe may praise deserue in long and after dayes. But not to al doth nature giue a thing of value such, Yea vnto fewe she doth it deale, whose worthy fame so much For euer liues in peoples mouthes long after deathes distresse. But O condicions yll to tel, O wondrous fransinesse: Who would not now be calde &amp; thought a Gentleman by name: O Knauishe sorte, O creatures vile beyond all kinde of shame: Triumphing names do thee delight, and fame abrode to yel, Thee glory likes, then why not payne, and vertuousnesse as wel, Contents thy minde that worthyly thou mayst be named than A Gentleman, lykes it thee more a wise and sobre man, Deseruing not, than of desert accompted for to be? Why is not chalke for cheese as wel delighting vnto thee As lying name of Noblenesse? O vile disguised spright, O Monkey, learne to brydle wyl, to guide thy minde aright, Reason to vse, to flye the things that shameful are and vayne, Haunt righteousnesse &amp; know thy selfe, and labour hard sustayne. Fly slouthfulnesse, wherby thou mayste attayne to vertue hie Then mayst thou wel a Gentleman be calde, and worthylie, This, this, is true Nobillity, these gifts the Gods bestowne, And these rewardes to men, vnto the vnlearned sorte vnknowne. This way the auncient Romaines went, by this their Empire flew Aboue the Starres, and when it ceaste then bad their state adew. For when as their vnthrifty seede (their Empire thus encreast) Did spring amid more prosprous yeres, they following inward preast Great riot, playes, and wantonnesse did cleane forsake the state Their fathers helde before, whereby did noblenesse them hate: And went againe the Heauens to till ryot forewarde wrought And vice, whereby was Rome at length cleane sackt, and spoilde to nought. It is not kinred thoe nor bloud nor spechelesse Imagrie, Nor heapes of Golde that can thee make a Gentleman to be. Uertue, vertue, by hir was made both Hector and Alcide Of noble state, by this againe right Gentleman was tryde That wight to whom the Iliades got an euerlasting name. with diuers other worthy states of still abiding fame. why bragst thou that thou doste descende of noble stocke and bloud? Great syres thee got, what then, if thou thy selfe be nothing good? If thou a villaine doe defyle and staine thy familye Then is thy bloud no honour sure but meere reproche to thee. Thou art a Monster, shame to them from whom thy bloud doth passe As when the stately Lion stoute begettes a sely Asse Or Ape of Eliphant is borne: for noblenesse not so Is left you here by Testament nor vertue giuen so, As house and land and housholde stuffe. this nature cleare hath delt Unto thine Auncetours before, which yet they all not felt. For if thou shalt the lyne well searche from whence thou fyrst wert twinde, Thou shalt perch?ace of thine own bloud full many a cobler finde, And many a Carter cleane, and one of them thou shalt well see was first that causde in time thy stocke such Gentlemen to bee. which as it did in time encrease so time shall it decay For time doth here bring euery thing and time takes all away. Amongst vs all what man to come of Pompeis bloud is founde? Of Cesars line, or of that man to whom did Affricke grounde A surname giue by vertue great? what man would once haue thought That such a stately stocke as these should euer come to nought? The highest houses often fall and come to meere decay: Oft comes the little house aloft, of man the state alway Can not endure. The skyes aboue doe alter mortall things. But thou wilt saye, what kinde of seede is sowne, such fruite it brings, If I of noble stocke doe come then shall I noble bee. Not so, for oft a squall is borne of goodly men we see And fayre and eke welfauourde men yll fauourde knaues haue got, Of witty men haue Asses come. The mind engendreth not As doth the corps of fathers seede, nor in the fathers sure It lyes, to giue the children minde. This, nature doth procure. What fruite can noble seede vp bring if skyes doe not agree? Most true it is that people say the yeare, not husbandrie Doth giue the corne a good encrease, if seede amyd the grounde Though best be cast, and thereto starres agreing not be founde, Thereof will eyther Darnell spring or lost it els will be, Thus noble children for to get the father not (we see,) Sufficient is except the grace of Heauens him permit. That many base, proue noble men of this here chaunceth it: Who by their vertue and desertes obtayning fame thereby Did after noble make themselues. What was the Vergill hie? What was the famous Cicero what Cato wyse, deuine? Or what else was Horatius? all borne of franklynes lyne. Of whom did learned Homer come whose syre nor countrey we As yet doe knowe? Demosthenes hys father tell thou me, And mother of Euripides? declare the worthy line Of Socrates, of him I say, from whom the sawes deuine Did Plato learne, who counted was as then Apollo thought The wysest man, hym Mason got that in the Marble wrought, And eke a Midwyfe was hys dame. We also well doe knowe That many haue bene crowned Kings whose parents were but lowe. Not seldome Emperours haue come from base and small estate To honours hye, what sayst thou then syth all degenerate, Both horse &amp; dogges and other beastes from their long wonted kinde? For nothing can long time endure but all things worse we fynde In time to be by natures rule and law that still endures Of destenies, till that againe an other byrth procures Restored state, this altering the worldes chiefe grace I take This is the hiest workmans prayse of little things to make Great matters, and the ample things reduce to smal estate, To chaunge the face of euery thing and styl to renouate Most prudently al things in tyme. I do not here deny But that it is a goodly thing to come of parents hye, And to be borne of auncient bloud: for it is worthy sure. With ayde and good examples eke such fathers do procure Their children like themselues to be if Fates do not say nay, Or nature strong of force to much: which who so seekes to stay, As wel may clime wyth heaped hylls in heauens hie to dwel Depriuing Ioue of regal seate as fame to vs doth tel When Phlegurs fieldes the tumult felt of ghastly Giants stout, How then the great Enceladus, by force did bring about The great and huge Olimpus hill with Ossa for to lie While Ossa then was ouer pressde with mighty Pelion hie. But yet we count not this ynough though all therefore thee call A Gentleman, and thou art fayre and framed well withall Of pleasaunt face, and farest well and goest in proude aray, And thereby shewest thy noble stocke, for this no man can say Thou art a Gentleman, but that dame Fortunes grace is thine, And thou full like a golden puffe and like a marble signe. But who regardes, for now ynough it is, to haue the name Of vertuous, and of gentlemen, eche man to seeme the same Desyreth more than it to be. O Gods, aboue that guide, Now names of great magnificence and titles hie besyde All men desyre and arrogate, they hunt and it possesse, The Asse a Libarde calles himselfe the Ant a Lionesse. Who will not gentle, iust, and wyse, well learnde and honest now Be counted here? contented well with barke alone of bowe And outwarde shadowes of the thing that vnder such a cloke His wicked maners he may hide. Now name beares all the stroke And not the thing: well take therfore this noble name to thee As Pasquill is at Rome and as both Theeues and Harlots bee, Be noble thou like marble signe. I put the case a Gentleman by name and eke in deede Thou art, what good shall it thee doe, hereof what shall proceede? Thou aunswere wilt, I shal haue praise and honours shall obtaine. Are these rewardes not to be sought? or seme they to be vaine. Of noblenesse doth vertue breede, of vertue prayse doth spring And honor eke. I will not (for it seemes no lawful thing) With vertue finde a fault: but if with cleare and perfect eye Thou shalt beholde the truth in deede, then shalt thou playne espye What grefe &amp; payns this vertue brings and bytter lyfe doth make, Though they that are of Stoik sect this for to graunt forsake. And fyrst we wil the mortal parte beholde so difficil That who so seekes it for to kepe must needes employ his wil Great cares and labours for to take, wyth nature warres proclayme, And fight he must: for nature so doth minde of man constrayne Both weake and prone in vice to be and vertues enimy. O God, ful soone in vice eche one doth fal ful readily, What is the cause that nature is of man so naught and vile? Was this thy fault Promotheus? or doth the fiende beguile, And plant such illes in mortall brest as fame doth playnly tell, And causeth loue of wickednesse? The way that leades to well Ful hard and sharp and paynful is, who can we good now fynde? Of his owne selfe not one, who not of yll and wicked minde? Such one as feare of King or lawes prohibites to offend, Or such as cannot wel perfourme the crime he doth entend. It is not easy sure to winne and nature put to flight, Nor for to stay the furies fell within the heart that fight, Wherfore it needeful is to striue from yeres of youthful trayne, With dayly flight and labours great, the vices to restrayne. For custome wonted is to break the force of nature sure If that by many yeares it hath bene vsed to endure. Mannes life a warrefare (ergo) is eche fielde the enimy Possesseth ful, al ful of theeues, such gynnes who then can fly? So many nets who can escape? for when that fortune smyles Then creepes in fond laciuiousnesse, and strings with thousand wiles, Fast by encampeth swelling pride with slouth and gluttony, And folish boldnesse strayght doth ryse wyth griefe and feare thereby, And poyson fel of enuy and yre doth then possesse his minde. When as he liues in great vnhap then seekes he for to finde Al meanes he can away to driue his wretched pouerty, Then false he playes, he robs &amp; steales, his lack for to supply. Oh Lord thus wise are mortal men betwene the cruel rockes Of Charibdis and Scilla tost, of both receyue they knockes. And while they seke these yls to shunne to other straight they fall. If valeant they do seeke to be then daungers dire they shall And yrkesome labours also fele if vertue they do heede That guides the actes of mortal men, then them commaundeth neede Al ioyes away to driue and put, and eke wyth saged sawe A life vnpleasant for to leade. If iust and righteous lawe Seeke any man for to obserue, then profyt must away This iustice is of many praysde and fewe retayne it aye. If prudence any man do please he must in any case Beware he put his trust in none, for now in euery place Are great deceytes, and perils rise, and wyth simplicity In fine who that is good receaues most often harme we see, He least in safety liues and feeles more hurt than al the rest For this same world a storehouse is where mischiefes al be prest, All goodnesse here exiled is the simple Hares thereby The fearfull Hart, the harmelesse gotes their bane come sonest by, But rare the hunter hunts the Beare, amyd the woods so hie The Lion reasts, go now thy wayes, and leade thou simply A gentle life wyth innocents, that soner so thou may Unto the greedy gaping wolues become a grateful pray. The world (alas) doth now abound with tirants ouer al, The strong tread vnder fote the weake, the mighty hurt the smal. The Egles chase the fearful Swannes, the Haukes doe Throstles kil, And sary simple seely doues destroyes with croked byl. The speckled Serpent kylls the Frogs and Lizartes vp doth eate And in the woods the greatest beastes of lesser make their meate. Thou monsters also doest possesse O seas of mighty powre That wyth a gaping greedy throte the little fysh deuoure. Not sea, not earth, not aire is safe, the enmy euery where Is now at hand, it profits smal to liue vnhurtful here. Beholde how good is vertues parte that goodnesse here doth trayne, For when ye haue it gotten once with labour and great payne Amid your enmies al she doth you thus vnarmed send. But thou wilt say, such vertuousnesse do lawes and Kings defend. O would to God that this were so, but now in euery place With money lawes corrupted are and eke the Princes grace Is pleasde with precious gifts and sute, the lawes set them on rack That eyther haue no pens to pay or frendship else do lack. The other scape as innocents howsoeuer iudgement trye: Lyke as the fly that smallest is in weaued Cobweb hye That Spyder makes remayneth wrapt where if a greater stray She breakes the nettes, &amp; flyes abrode The lawes (as wel doth say That Barbarous sage of Scythia) the seely soule doth tye Whereas the rich and mighty men burst through ful easily. The other parte of vertue, that doth search wyth studious payne And for to knowe the causes hyd of nature, doth obtayne, And troth to learne, that scarce you can at any time come by: How hard and ful of payne it is they knowe that it do try. Fyrst vnder maisters rule wyth strypes they are constraynde to liue, And there accoumpt of lessons hard with feare and teares to giue: Shut vp as it in prison were whereby they may not goe Abrode, wythout the tyrants leaue although them forceth thoe The office of the Campo Clubbe, restraynt of Blathers might, Though hunger pricke, and lust to play wherein they most delight. But when the yeares of youthful state approching present stand, Then nede requires more diligence some one then sekes the land Wherein Anthenor last arriued with raging flouds to striue Of Venice gulfe, to Naples else through Tuscan seas doth driue: An other fast to Perouse sayles or gayneward Rome do fleete, There from his countrey farre exilde wyth many woes to meete, With lack of meate and quiet sleepes and want of Venus play, On bookes wyth study for to loke, applying day by day. For otherwyse can none be learnd except wyth vntrue fame, For fewe are learned now in deede but many are in name. Ioyes hurt them much &amp; pleasures eke that seke for to attayne To top of learnings palace hie: for this beates back agayne Their mindes from treading crabbed pathes by which the iourney bends To fayre Mineruaes holy house. For he that thus intendes A name throughout the world to get, must suffer dayly payne. Great griefs hereby some men wyth yll digestion eft sustayne, Of many whilste to much they reade both syght and eyes decay, By study great their stomack rawe their colour falles away. Then leannesse c?mes w? wayward age nor maruel is it thoe, Sith for to knowe the truth doth styll beyond mannes nature goe, And proper is to God alone. Like as the Owle of night Can not beholde the shining Sunne, with clere and perfect sight: So fares the minde of man as oft as it intends to flye Aloft, to search the secret things falles headlong strayght from hye. Now mortal men dare reache at things to Gods appropriate, And foolisher they proue themselues the more they seke the state Of things whereof the knowledge doth pertaine to them no whit? Except that God gra?t them from hye both reason grace and wit. But happy are the Aungels all for they the worlde doe know What thing it is, how much, how great whereof it fyrst did grow, The Lorde and maker of the same, all things that may be thought, The Causes hid, the priuie strengthes whereby all things are wrought. This is the lyfe that they doe leade and this their pleasure all: On meate or sleepe they neuer thinke to griefes they are not thrall, No hope of gaine, no feare of losse doth cause them for to fret, But alwayes are of perfect power this knowledge true to get. Sapience to Aungels doth belong and Gods aboue you see Where onely prudence doth pertaine to men that mortall bee Whereby they may take good aduise from harmes and hurts to flie And gather things that may giue ayde and liue here quietly. What thing to doe and what to leaue to man doth prudence showe Therefore who wysheth well to liue and eke where thornes doe growe With feete vnpricked for to go, let him seeke hir to knowe. Who wyll not hym acount a foole that things of greatest gaine Forsaking quite, doth seeke to get things strange and also vaine, Who sekes aboue his reache to roue and while he climes to hie Comes tumbling downe lyke Icarus. in waters deepe to lye? The Tode that late did seeke to matche the Oxe in drinking vaine His panche asunder bursten thoe doth neuer drinke againe: while as syr Phæton sought to rule the brideled iades on hye with earthly hande, was he not forcde in Padus streams to lye His life and chariot both resygnde with this vnhappy fall? The prudent man containes himselfe within dame natures wall Nor more he dare than hym becomes except that God him moues: Let mortall men such things regarde as mortall men behoues. Let them not search beyond their powre least if they clyme to hye They hedlong fal and proue themselues a laughing stocke thereby. As if an Oxe woulde vpwarde clime abrode his flight to take, Or if an Asse a Lute would sounde melodious noise to make. But let it bee that one obtaine all artes in memory, By which he many bookes can make, what good gettes he thereby? what iust rewarde shall conteruaile the paines that he endures? Fame, prayse, and glory, thou wilt say rewarde to him procures, Hys name thereby shall euer lyue, and alwayes eke remayne. But I would haue the wel perpende and also viewe more playne What prayse, what fame, and glory is. For many things we see, In other shapes than in their owne transformed for to bee Which w? a cloke and shadowing mist deceiue the minde and eyes. Hereof good things are counted nought and euill good likewise: All foolishnesse hereof doth spring. Ful oft is Copper tride In Siluer rounde enclosde to lye, oft Golde doth Iron hyde, And purest shelles within containe the nuts that rotten bee, In skinnes of sheepe full oft to lurke the wylie Wolfe you see. Doe not the gorgeous hangings hyde the dusty mouldred wall, Where gaping riftes vnsemely syt and wormes consuming crall? There is a sharper syght that sees what hyd in secrete lyes, Who vseth thys shall iudge aright and wonders see with eyes. I here demaunde what fame doth help, what prayse? or what renowne? To them that sleepe? or vnto them whom death hath stricken downe? No more for trouth than doth the harp, the deafe vnhearing wyght, No more th? gorgeous plays doth plese the man that lackes hys syght. Thou answerst here, that they that liue and they that here awake Reioyce therin, and for the same no perils they forsake, But breath and bloud doe both resigne thys thing for to obtaine. Ambition many doth enforce and driue to glories gaine Much like a spurre, and many brings to toppes of vertue hye With prickes, prouoking sluggishe folk by force of sworde to try Some worthy thing, and if they nilt by force perfourme the same, That then by wyt they take in hande some thing of worthy fame. Yet is ambition sure a vice and no man will we see Be called so, and they that are ambitious, counted bee Both vain and proude of naughty mind as once the Romains warre, Requested of the common sort (reiecting shame afarre) As oft as they their voices sought with humble sute did pray Good will of Rascalles for to get that they might beare the sway In c?mon welth, their owne things left whereby they might go iet Amid the stretes with traine of men and stately countenaunce set. For hir owne selfe is vertue sought, and not for honors sake, Though she of right deserueth sure chiefe honors for to take. No vertue moues the common sort they rather hir despise wherfore must Fortune fauour needes and richesse eke suffise. Then prayse renowne and worthinesse will also present be. In euery place if liuing lacke doth vertue begge we see. But yet it forceth not if that the donghill cocke doe gesse A precious stone as nothing worth, this makes not it the lesse Of value: so the vertuous man content with eche degre Despising praise of common sort regardes not vanitie. The face that well preporcioned is requires no paynted hewe, And of it selfe may bare be shewde the golde that tryed is true. But he that vertue is without doth counterfait the same And vnderneth disguised cloke procures a vertuous name. wherfore if thou dost well discerne thou shalt beholde and see This mortall lyfe that here you leade a Pageant for to bee. The diuers partes therein declared the chaunging world doth showe The maskers are eche one of them with liuely breath that blow. For almost euery man now is desguised from his kinde And vnderneth a false pretence they sely soules doe blinde. So moue they Goddes aboue to laugh wyth toyes and trifles vayne, Which here in Page?ts fond they passe while they do life retayne. Fame, glory, prayse, and eke renowne are dreames and profitlesse Bicause with chaunce they are obtaynd and not by vertuousnesse. But let it be they graunted are to such as worthy be Tel me do they the body good? no whit I promise thee. Help they the mind? as much for truth, they blowe them vp before Depriuing them of sobrenesse they make them careful more. For he that after honour seekes must cap and crouch ful low Wyth bribing gifts beseching men his simple state to know. This is therefore a wretched life and ful of businesse, With enuy oft it compassde is and oft in great distresse. But he that vertue true can get he liues most quietly And happy enough, let him commit the rest to Gods on hye. Sufficient honour vnto man is to deserue the same, For to the vnworthy honour dealt you can not honour name, To such it is a burden great and more a scorneful thing As when vpon the stage a foole comes dressde vp like a King. Now wil I here declare and tel of man the mischieues al Assone as he from mothers wombe with bloud embrued doth cral, He strayghtway cries, and weping luck him brings to wretched life, For seing wel by nature shewde the cares and bytter strife Wherwith this mortall life abounds. So depe with groning winde The marchant sighes, and feares as oft as he doth cal to minde The perils great that ships are in, the force of Pirats hand, The boystrous windes, &amp; raging Seas, with rockes and drenching sand. Then by and by but scarce yet borne him binding bonds do holde, And straight his tender ioynts and lims the swadling clothes do folde: As tokens yll of bondage great that he in time must weare, For who is free? lawes, kings &amp; crimes haue al thing subiect here, And eche man serues for hope of gayne or else wyth force constraynd. Al beastes as sone as they are bred with lymmes are straight sustaynd. And walke abrode immediatly, where man is nothing so, But long his mouth and minde he lacks and strength of limmes to go. Much like a sounding picture made with crying neuer styll Disturbing al men night and day with voyce and waylings shrill. And when on limmes he stiffer stands, and words can wel pronounce Then bound he is, and suffers threates, then maisters on him bounce, With lashing strypes, and ofte his syre, oft mother on him layes, Sometime his brothers buffets flye, sometime his stepdames frayes, with blowes not few that stepsyre giues and when this age is past Then lusty youth approching c?mes, and strength increaseth fast. Now from his mouth he shakes the bit, now councel none he heares, He rageth now with furious mode, and burnes in youthful yeares, With rage and riot runnes he mad, and rash without aduise, No counsell will he take therein, but wytty sawes despise. No daungers now he doth esteme so he the thing obtayne Whereto lasciuious lust him moues and force of wilful brayne. Neglecting lawes he brawles &amp; fyghtes and braynsicke runnes astray, The greatest parte of youth are now with surfets led away. A fewe whome feare, or shamefastnesse or wysdome doth restrayne, Their youthfull dayes vprightly leade and voyd of vicious stayne. Now grauer age and wiser c?mes, and cares with hir she brings, And labours hard, then toyles the man about a hundred things, And al the meanes he can he sekes his liuing to prouide, At home he neuer ydle stands, but here or there must ride, In towne, or else at fielde he works with labour great and payne, His wife, his children and his men wherby he may sustayne. Alone for al he careth then, he tastes no daynty meate, Nor quiet sleepes, but forward nowe him driues ambition great And giues him rule in common wealth, where while for honours hie The foole doth gape, he malice doth and mischieues great come by. Then wrinkled age wyth hoary hayres encrocheth in apace The body fades, the strength abates, the beauty of his face And colour goes, his senses fayle, his eares and eyes decay, His taste is gone, some sicknesse sore frequenteth him alway, Scarce chawes his meate his tothlesse chaps scarce walks w? staffe in hand His croked olde vnweldy limmes, whereon he scarce may stand. The minde likewise doth feele decay, now dotes he like a childe, And through his weake and aged yeres is wisdome quite exilde. Eche age therefore his mischiefe hath, but mischiefes more there be, That doth belong to euery age to al of eche degree. Sometime doth colde to much them vex and Snowes that flakey flye, And Northern Boreas winde so brym when Ise doth hang full hie On house, and when the waters depe congealed styll do stay Now raging heate of Sommer burnes while Sunne doth kepe his way Through blasing breath of Lion fierce, the fields depriude of greene, The gro?d by drythe doth gape for rain and moysture none is seene, The hearbs &amp; grasse their liues resigne, the Pooles and Fennes be dry Nowe hunger pricks, nowe thirste doth greue and dearth doth make th? cry: Who can in verse declare to men the sicknesses that raynes In mortal life? the Agues hote, the griefe and raging paynes That ouer al the body runnes? eche member poyson feeles, The hand, the syde, the syght, is vext and al from head to heeles Doth griefe and sicknesse sore sustayne, Why do I them resight? Why seke I here the Cranes to tell in Strimon flouds that light? Or number great of Swans that swim in streames of Troian land? Oft times the minde doth lose his state by hearbs or Witches hand: Or when at sacred Ceres feast some fiende in brest doth lye, Or when possest wyth Bacchus force abrode with rage they flye, Though griefe w? yre and couetousnesse ambition and delight As much the senses do confound as doth of wine the might Procuring darknesse to the minde. If truth we therfore say, Al dronke with beastly affects of minde are most men at this day, But fewe (alas) there can be found that reele not here and there, That can discerne what they should do wyth beames of eyesight clere: And guide them selues by reasons rule. Hereof aduisedly One sayd the number endlesse was of fooles abrode that flye. For who nedes not Helleborus that giues the purging stooles? But seuen wise the Grekes could finde, among ten thousand fooles. The nurse and dam of mortal kinde dame Folly sure is thought Wythout whose grace all thing woulde fade and men wold here do nought, She Captayne chief are wars begunne and al that thereto long, As armour bright, and Targets fayre with Ancents eke among. Where colours faire abrode doe blase wyth sundry sort of beastes, Of hir comes playes and daunces fyne and dronken Bacchus feastes, All nice delightes and wanton gestes wyth sutes of fonde aray From hir doth come, w? heapes of bokes compyled day by daye. The floudes of trifles fonde doe flowe by hir, and euery thing Most part at least that man here doth, proceede from such a spring. But now the wofull hurts and harmes and dolefull destenye That man sustaines, can none declare though eloquent he be, Now drownde in fluds here sinks theron and vnto fyshes great The symple wretche of soule depriude becomes a dainty meate. An other downe from house doth fall and shewes a tumbling point, And through hys hast receiues a clap that crackes hys chiefest ioint: Or batters sore his tender limmes and some the lightnings smite Or tempest kils, on some againe the falling house doth light, And doth vnlode him of his braines, some fier fries to death, Wyth hurtfull herbs or Mushroms vile some yelde their vitall breath. And some when as to fast he eates, while gredy guts doe gripe, Doth ouercharge his peece with lumps that stops hys drinking pipe. How many feares the raging beast with teeth something to keene, With Iron shoes of Horses slaine how many hath bene seene And many goarde w? wilde Bulls horne that roring mad doth fling? What shuld I shew the daungers great that man to man doth bring? No beast he needeth more to feare than fellowes of his owne: So many knaues and theeues hereby and persons vile are knowne, So many witnesse false that beare, so many vicious slaues, So many liuing on the spoyle, and cut throte swearing knaues, Disturbing reast of mortall men and in none other plight, Than doth the merry beastes disturbe the Lionesse in syght. He with hys tongue procureth harme, he with hys sworde doth fray, The greatest sort with craft doth hurt, one robbes in open way, An other filcheth priuily: some sort there also be, That vnder cloke of frendship strong or of Hypocrisye, Such men deceiue as they doe knowe to be of credite light. All men almost (O wicked kinde) in others harme delight, The brother scarce may brother trust, eche man his friende must feare The father of hys sonne in doubt doth liue, sure Hell is here, The furies and the stinking flouds that lye in Lumbo lake The gaping grenning Helhound wood and all that Hell doth take. Sleepe only peace to man doth bring amid his fleeting life, Nothing than this (if dreames fray not) more sweete or voide of strife: For cares and labour it exiles, and with his pleasant wings, The wretched body resting brodes, and sweete estate him brings. Yet nature seemes thys rest to hate and ordainde hath hereby The stinging Gnat and byting Flea, to vexe continually With twinging prick this pleasant ioy, whereby both night and day Might mischiefes euer present be. More better farre away Therefore is death, than picture hys, For who so once the seas of lyfe in ioyfull bote hath past, And in the quiet hauen fayre his Anker safe hath cast, With mery heart doth laugh to scorne the blastes of raging wyndes With tempests black, and Leucoths hed which floury Garlandes byndes, Doth honor much, and Melicort with giftes he doth salute, And safe amid the shore he ioyes with playes of sundry sute. Death endes al pain, al bonds doth lose, death causes feare to flie, And daungers all by death are forcde to rest eternally. And as no griefe nor paine thee vext before thy Syre thee got, So shalt thou feele no griefe nor paine when death hir dart hath shot. Who can conceiue the times as yll he felt hys byrth before? Or iudge of dayes he neuer saw or shall see neuer more? Or who will once dispraise the night as wretched, nought or yll Wherein possest of deadly sleepe he senselesse lay ful still? For what is death continuall sleepe. what sleepe? for small time death. But many thinke soules neuer die but after losse of breath The dead they say doe liue againe, and fleshe forsaking quite As cockels from the shell outdrawne to Pluto take their flight: And downwarde hedlong fast they run in kingdome blacke to sayle. There faine they woods of Mirtel trees where wofull louers wayle. There riuers run wyth flaming flouds and dreadfull Monsters bee That poys? fome, with gaping throtes, theyr places may you see Of diuers forme, where Infants crye, and where the gilty Ghostes The furies fierce of Hell doe burne, and whip fast lynckd to postes, And where the pleasant fieldes doe lye with goodly greene arayed, As due to blessed men that here their pagents wel haue playde. But other now say otherwise and soules they graunt remayne But those that wel in earth haue liude with starres aboue shall rayne, And they againe that lyke to beastes haue serude licencious minde, And God neglect, in forme of beastes to liue are all assinde: In brutishe shape to wander long by iudgement iust are made, Til time that purged from their crime they come to hyghest grade. Which things in deede if they wer true death fearefull might be thought, Or at the least a better lyfe and voide of sinne be sought: For to the iust hereby is got the ioyes and pleasures true, Wheras the wicked shall receiue their paines and merits due. But whether that the deade doe liue or that they nothing bee And soule with body hath hys ende, pertaineth not to mee. For I mee thinks haue sayd ynough: enquire of Sister mine, Whom Grecians, wysedome euer call, these thoughtes she doth defyne, And alwayes searcheth secrete things and verity doth showe, Hir teaching, well thou maist attaine the state of soules to knowe. Except it serue to tell thee that death is not to be dred, At least vnto the iust that here a righteous life haue led: For eyther quiet rest they haue in sleepe that still doth last, Or happy else they shall receiue rewardes for vertue past. wherfore go to liue Godly now, put vice from minde away, So death shall seme but light to thee and graue thee not shall fray. But now in minde these words reuolue both speake and think this thing: What hurt shall death to mee procure what losse shall graue mee bring? No whit for trouth. what will it haue? of richesse mee depriue. But richesse then I shall not neede, for nothing then I striue. But richest then I may be calde, for welthyest is the wight Not that doth most possesse, but he that lacketh least in syght. Gold, siluer, precious stones, and lands, with sumptuous fyne aray With other lyke, I will despise, as things that I not way: Nor pleasure past shall greue me then no more than greueth beastes Swete plesant sparkling wines to lack or Custards fyne in feastes The thinges that no man doth desyre what if they not be had? But friends &amp; children sweete to leaue wil make (thou sayest) men sad. Why shuld this thing me greue so much, were it not hurtful more If in my life my frends should dye and I lament therfore Continually? as some do write how for Antilochus Syr Nestor wept, as for his sonne (whome slewe the King Turnus While he the Troians armies helpt) Euandre liude in woe. I go before, and what for this they all shall after goe, When God appoynted hath their time, and me agayne shall see: If soules be ought as we beleue, as Christ declares they be. Well whatsoeuer that it is death yll I may not call Bycause it riches takes away and pleasaunt ioyes wythall. For vnto vs these are but lent, the vse doth nature giue, And not the thing it selfe she deales to mortal men that liue. Sith nothing then to me belongs to death I wyl resigne Al other things that here I haue as nothing sure of mine. What if I others goods do leaue? wherfore should I lament If nature nowe do aske agayne the things that she me lent? I naked came into this world and naked wil I out. For this world is an Inne where hostes of men a wondrous route: Who for a time do vse the foode that layes before their face, Their hoste and therewithal doth say, syrs take and eate apace, Not for desertes of you we giue these things, but of good wyll These pleasant dishes here we set therewith your selues to fyll Untill such time as I thinke good to byd you hence departe And say from vp my table rise, now eate with ioyfull harte, But when the houre last shal come wherein I byd you go, With willing minde obey me then, and place resigne you thoe To other gests that here shal syt, let them reioyce a while wyth dishes these: who wyll repine (except he be to vile, Lack wyt, or else vnthanckfull be) hearing these wordes to go From others dores, or else wyll syt while he commaundeth so? But he shal cry come forth you Knaue and thrust him out by the eares And yll apayd he forwardes goes, wyth woful weping teares. Wherfore should I if he do call that all things here doth guide Repine to go from hence, or seeke in wretched life to byde As many do? nor fyt it is, nay willing hence I go And leaue this fylthy world I wyll, where thousand mischieues flowe, Where fayth is none, where godlinesse, where iustice none doth dwell, Where peace and quietnesse is fled, where vices beare the bell, Where brother sekes the brothers blud, where sonne the father hates, Where discorde euermore doth raigne, and guile in maried mates. No man there is, at least but rare, who (if he can) not steales, Who robbeth not, who doth not fayne, and who not falsiy deales. That well this world may now be calde of theeues a gaping den. Loe, Kings and Bishops proude besyde, by name of Godly men The commons poore do powle and pyl, and Citizens do shere And simple innocents destroy. what should I recken here The horedomes great committed now? all flowes with vice we see, The naughty act do yong men vse, and close misused be, Who plants not hornes in neighbours heads? the balde religious frye Who should be chast, abrode with hores or close wyth boyes do lye: To widdowes graue or tender maydes, the holy priestes do crepe. And some within their kinsfolkes bed haue great delight to slepe. Some slaues w? bests themselues defile: the fieldes and groue of tree And euery towne is now a stewes. And harmes that instant be And daungers great that haps to men, and labours great and sore, And al the supersticious sorte of false religious lore. What nede we subiectes now to be? syth (O the shameful state) Unwytty and grosseheaded fooles and they that learning hate (To whome the dice, and Dogs to kepe with byrdes of rauening kinde And horses ryde, with other toyes is all their chiledish minde) Do Scepters holde, and peoples guide, and gouerne Cities strong? Hereof such errors vp do spring with folishnesse among, Hereof so many vices breede if this thou callest to minde Thou shalt not feare this foolish worlde and nought, to leaue behinde: Yea thou wilt count it wel that once Calanus and his feares Did bring to passe, who slewe th?selues to scape these wretched yeares And staying death with hand did haste, nor longer would preserue The dying Corps, nor wretched flesh with labour long to serue. And if religion sayd not nay and lawes of Plato hie And GOD himselfe, I would persuade thee forthwith for to die, And wicked chaunce and wretched earth to leaue as vayne and nought, Not wine as wine desyred is but wine and good is sought. So life as life is nothing worth if goodnesse lack we see, If it be naught, as wine corrupt let it despised be. For life it selfe we nede not wysh, nor fled it ought to be. The worme, the flye, and euery stone and barke of euery tree, And euery vile and little thing doth life in it possesse, No kinde of thing desyred is where wanteth pleasauntnesse. If it be not both life and good I see no cause whereby, It should be wisht or may be loued. Therefore who feares to dye Is but a foole since he desires such hurt and harme to byde Both of the body and the minde with labours long besyde Before he would al kinde of grieues with flesh from him expel, And euer in tranquillity and perfect rest to dwell, Or leauing members here behinde to liue for euermore, Where he shal want no kinde of thing nor sorrow feele nor sore, And with the saincts togither there about the world to flye, More swift than al the windes that be beholding things on hye. Except the dregs of vice him stay and force him styll to dwell Beneath in Corners deepe of earth amyd the raygne of Hell. When thus this Lady fayre had sayd she rose and stode by me And on my head (refusing I) she put the Laurell tree, And thence departing forth she flewe where shining starres we see. Explicit media Pars. Libra, The seauenth Booke. My muse a loft, raise vp thy self and vse a better flite: Mo?t vp a hie, &amp; think it scorn of base affayres to write. More great renoune, and glory more, in hautye matters lyes. Uiew thou y? Gods, and take thy course thorowout the starrye Skyes. Where springtime lastes for euermore, where peace doth neuer quayle, Where Sunne doth shine continuallye, where Light doth neuer fayle. Clowde causer Southwinde none there is nor boystrous Boreas blowes, But mylder breaths y? Western windes where sweete Ambrozia growes. Take thou thys way, and yet somtimes downe falling fast from hye, Now vp, now downe, wyth sundry sort of Gates aloft go flye. And as some hawty place he seekes that couets farre to see, So vp to Ioue, past starres to clyme, is nedefull nowe for thee. There shalt thou from the towry top of Crystall coloured skye, The plot of all the world beholde, with viewe of perfit eye. Beginning first both chiefe and hye from whom all things doe floe. As from a spring, there is but one They erre that think them moe. For if more heds than one ther were, then eyther not at all They differ should, and so be one, or much, and then we shall Accompt, some one among the rest more noble, great, and hye, From whom the other seme to spring and reast are ruled by. For, if there many mouers be, if power and rule to all Be lyke, yet if their mindes and wils contrary fall, Then open warres among them dwels, and cruell malice springs. Then discorde strayght disturbance in throughout all the motion brings. As if a shyp with equall blast a sort of wyndes should driue, Tossed here, &amp; there, with doubtful mind the vessell sore doth striue: And doth not knowe nor vnderstande to runne the redyest way, All ignoraunt which Lorde to serue is forced still to stay. But if lyke minde to all, and wyll beginnings haue but one, In vaine of more acount is made for one shall serue alone. For if that one can not suffise but ayde of others call: If not but iointly moue they can they are vnperfect all. Nor truely can we terme them chiefe from whence all other springs, For perfect needes must be preferde before thunperfect things. The symple than the compounde is of value farre more hye, And more than numbers one, &amp; pure th? myxt, no wyse man wyll denye. But yet I thinke it here as best by reason thys to proue. The cause is fyrst before the effect the workman worke aboue. The perfect thing, bicause it doth eche parte in it containe, And nothing lacks, is stronger farre of greater force againe. Therfore it makes, c?maunds, &amp; moues, and so by chalenge due The cause and Auctor eke of all it may be tearmed true. But otherwyse thunperfect thing that maymde can not consist, Is ouercome, and moue it must euen as the perfyte list. It doth obey and not commaunde, and therfore must be named The effect, and eke the framed worke, and not the thing that framed. So farre behinde it euer ought the perfect thing to goe. For if vnperfite were the spring from whence all thing doe floe, It were but vile and nothing wrought therof should perfect be, As alwayes of thunperfect Arte vnperfect worke we se. Wherfore beginnings more than one no reason forth can finde, Bicause there is not to be knowne but one of perfect kinde. From which, the neuer fayling course and order of all things Doth come, as from the Union fyrst eche other number springs. Besydes it pure and syngle is, that mixtures all hath made: For nothing can compounded be but symples fyrst is had. For fyrst it nedefull is alone the symples to be tryde, And then in mixture all in one compounded to abyde. Therfore no principall there is but one, as I haue taught: Which symple in degree we iudge, and purest must be thought. Whom if we think not for to liue, in error great wee fall: If he liue not, how liues the reast, synce by him lyue we all? Doubtlesse he liues, and wisedome hath, or else in order dewe, How could he frame such goodly sightes except he all things knew? Nor doubt we must, but needes c?fesse; with mouth and eke with heart, Him to be good: Can he be ill of whom eche good is part? Can bitter streames at any time from sweetest fountaine runne? Or can the riuers pleasant be of bytter spring begunne? For eyther nothing must be good, or good must he be thought, That is the spring of all the rest, by whom the worlde was wrought. Hym men doe call by diuers names, but we that Latine wright Doe call him God, and more we saye that Iupiter he hight. Who, synce he is the first that was, and maker of eche one, Liues of himself both good and wyse, receiuing state of none. But all by him their states enioy, who may lose that they haue, Whensoeuer he lyst for to restraine the thing that fyrst he gaue. As Ryuers must leaue of theyr course when springs their stremes deny, And yet it followes not therfore the spring it selfe be drye: (For of it selfe it yeldes the streame and hanges at no mans tayle:) So God doth of himselfe consyst, and therfore cannot fayle. If altogither perishe should, yet fayles not he therfore, For what consysteth of it selfe must last for euermore. When onely of himselfe he stayes, and nedes no helper by, When as by force he cannot quayle and wyll not willingly. He is all and whole, the rest but part, yet in no such degree, That of those partes he purest shoulde himselfe compounded bee. But by his vertue he is all, bicause he fyrst did frame The worlde so wide, and all things else conteyned in the same. All things that liue, and voide of lyfe, all things that doe appere, And hidden syghts he only made, and doth preserue them here. In this wyse therfore is he all as seede is all the tree, Wherof springs vp the mighty boole whose braunches shadowers bee. Some doubt if God a body haue, and thus doe they beleue, That nothing voide of body is that sense cannot perceue. And therefore now we will attempt the trouth therof to see, Of quantitie and qualitie all bodies needes must bee. For by these two state sensible the body doth receiue: Take these away what doth remaine that senses may perceiue? All quantities and qualities compounded euer bee, And God of nature syngle is as late I tolde to thee. Adde more to thys that bodyes all of forme and matter bee. Nor God can be of such a power as boundes may comprehende, When he abides for euermore, least so the worlde should ende. Nor body none is voide of boundes, but all are measurable. The compast forme hath his precincts, whose fashyon is most laudable. So hath the Square and Triangle, and all the shapes that bee. This reason proues no body is but it may measurde bee. And thus I proue, this body here in equall partes deuide Whereof the halfe let A possesse and B the other syde. I here demaunde if A as much as B can doe? or if these twaine Be infinite? so one shall serue, and thother shalbe vaine. If both haue power determinate the whole must haue the same. But who so seekes the vnbounded thing of bounded partes to frame, Shall proue vnwyse and thus ensewes the maker chiefe of all No body hath. But some there be perchaunce that aunswere shall God is a body infinite. but this doe I deny: For so should he eche place fill vp, and leaue none voide: wherby The rest should neuer be containde. so worlde there should be none, Nor we remaine, nor any thing saue he himselfe alone. Besydes, synce body here in life is of more noble state Than sensles Corse, we must not doubte but lyfe of hygher rate, Than Carcasse is. But here I aske if life a substance be? If not, then substance were more vile and of more base degree, Than that which substance is without. and if you bring in this, In suffring such absurditie the scholemen all will hisse. But if that lyfe a substance be, then body is but vaine, Since of it selfe it can consyst and seuered but remaine. And why should God a body take synce he at libertie Doth best enioy his state and hath no such necessitie? It is a thing superfluous eke, by which the lyfe enclosed As prisoners like is barde the place wherto it is best disposed. Therefore that chiefe Almighty Prince eternall good and wyse No body hath. Now will I shewe why many doe despyse Thys reason, and doe thinke it vaine. the cause hereof doth spring, That drounde in bodies grosse, &amp; blinded sense, they know no other thing But bodyes here. as through a glasse wyth any colour stainde Whosoeuer lookes, ech thing shal iudge of colour that is fained. Yet must we know, and doutlesse think, that diuers things there be, That eyther voyde of bodyes lyue, or of such pure degre Their bodyes are, that neyther eyes of ours can them beholde, Nor sense discerne, and so more worth than ours a thousand folde. Which thus perchaunce may proued be. all grosse and wayghty things, How much the more of earthly drosse annexde to them forth brings, So much more base and vyler be than that which seemes to flowe Of fyne and purer matter wrought, all mettals this doth showe. For looke when as by feruent heate of Fyrie flames they frye, They straightwaies melt, &amp; basest parts wherein most earth doth lye, As nothing worth, falles out to drosse. the purest and most fine, With better sounde and better shape before the eye doth shine. So Bread is best of purest meale wherof the Masters eate, Of grosser is the seruants foode, the worst is Mastyues meate. So Water, Wyne, and Oyle wyth like the worthyest of them bee, Such as most cleare and subtill seeme and lyghtest in degree. So meate the baser and grosest part by syege away doth fade The finest part remaines, wherof Fleshe, Bloud, and strength is made. What is the cause that common stones so rude and rusty lye? Where marble, &amp; the precious gemmes doe glyster in the eye. Nought else, but that in one of them lesse drosse of earth is founde, In thother, grosse and heauy moulde hath syght and value drounde. Therfore more foule, and baser farre such things are iudgde to be, Wherein most earth remaines, wherby they are calde of lesse degree. As drosse we take lesse golde to be, or golde of baser myne We can not call so iustly Golde as that already fyne. For of all Elaments the earth the vylest hath bene thought. And as the rubbish of the reste, cast by, when they were wrought Therfore the wysest workman fyrst dyd cause it lowe to lye, That distant farre it should remaine remoued from the skye. And thick in ball he cast it rounde, more lesse and small to bee, That saints might haue more plain prospect that liste the world to see. When that God had dect the world wyth Starres in trym araye, What drosse remaynde he bade y? winds to clense and swepe awaye. Then in with hasty course they rushe their Lordes awarde to do, The Northwinde blowes y? Southwind huffes, the West, and East set to. with striuing blasts they swepe y? fieldes and rounde in heape they cast Whatsoeuer they finde, constraining it: the earth is framed at last. Which, banished from the heauens hye, straight downe to center fell, No place more farre nor base appeares where Myser shee might dwell. Besyde, of weaker force it is, and eke of smaller power, Than all the reast of Elaments are, and feblest of the fower. For if by feruent heate of Sunne it be constrained to gape, Or pearced with Plow, it cannot ioyne, nor take his former shape. The waters if they parted be doe straight returne in one, And voide of all diuisyon semes as if there had bene none. So doth the ayre, and fier eke, if these deuided be, At fyrst they ioyne againe, so that no signe of hurt you se. And why? bicause they are more pure, and perfect in degree, And of their proper force alone they alwayes moued bee. But now the earth vnweldy thing of nature euer stayes, And more, is cause that sundry things can moue no kinde of wayes. For where most earth habounds, moste waight is found, such things apere Lesse apt to moue, the light more quick, and vnto life more nere. For lyfe in euery thing is cause whereby they moue alone. It nedes no profe the senselesse Corse doth stirre as doth a stone Since things in lyfe haue chief estate (for life excelleth all) Doubtlesse the light and mouing things the chiefest we may call. They erre therfore, that doe beleue no other things to be. But such as senses grosse perceiue, and eyes apparant see. For what more subtyle is than ayre, what lesse is felt or seene? By which haue many thought it voide as no thing to haue beene. It is but slight: what tho? yet hath it here a substance sure And body is, of foure chiefe, one, than earth or streame more pure, And therfore placed in hyer seate. for things approching nere To skyes, and blessed starres aboue, of chiefest state appere. Besydes, are not the wyndes so pure that no man can them see? Yet nothwithstanding none there is but knowes that windes there bee. Which when they haue a sunder burst the barres of Eolus strong, The monstrous Hills by force do shake, downe torne the trees along Doe lye, the Seas from chanell deepe are tossed aboue the shoares, The cloudes are caused, the lightnings flashe, the dreadfull thunder roares. Synce thus their force doth rage thinkst thou that substance they doe lacke? Bicause thou canst not them beholde, or in thy handes them take. To iudge as senses leade is fonde: for oftentimes the eyes In taking one thing for an other thys error plainely tryes. As if into the clerest spring a staffe most straight be thrust, The eye shall iudge it to be Croked though it be neuer so iust. As if a boate rowe nere the shore the shore shall seeme to flye And styll the boateis thought to stay, the senses therfore lye: Which many times deceiued be, and changed sundry wayes By age sometime or sycknesse great the force of them decayes: Nor euery man hath them alike, some thinkes it fayre and meete, The thing another sayth is fowle, and some do count it sweete, That others iudge of bitter taste: the ayre is colde sayth he, Another sayth the wether is hote, thus senses diuers be In diuers bodies, diuers seemes, deceaued sometyme by chaunce, As when the drunckard sees two lights for one, and stooles to daunce, The wine in troubling of his eyes doth much disease his sight, The ayre besydes deludes the sense, sometymes it semeth bright, Now darke, now thick, now moyst, now dry, wherby we often gesse The Sunne as, red as bloud to be, the Mone now bygge, now lesse. Hereof doth also come to passe when one aloud doth cry Deceauing folish cares a voyce doth seeme to aunswere nye. By this and other meanes they erre, but reason is more sure. Who findes amongst a thousand toyes, the certayne truth and pure. This reason is most deare to him that wisdome doth retayne, Whose minde is of a liuely force, and sprite of heauenly vayne. The blunt and doltish common sorte, wyth blinde and bleared eyes, Doth not hir see, hereof doth fault, vayne hope, and fansy rise. This reason guides the wysest men, Opinion leades the lowte, Let vs the steppes of reason tread, and toyle hir wayes about, This reason may be calde the Sunne that moues in order iust, By which alone from brutish kinde of beastes we differ must. The dark and dim vncertayne Moone, Opinion may be named, But what doth reason byd me write? that many creatures framed, Aliue there are that we can not by senses vnderstand: For if that God should not haue made, wyth hye and glorious hand, More noble creatures than the state of fading mortall kinde He had not then deserued such prayse as is to hym assinde, Unperfect eke had bene hys raine for vnderneth the kinde Of man the wilde and saluage beastes consyst of brutishe minde, To sleepe and feede, addicted all: and if he had not framed No better things than here we see the worlde might well be named A folde of filthy feeding flocks with thornes and donge set out What should we then this God account a mighty heardman stoute But he created man besydes: now sure a goodly thing: Was this hys best? is thys the power of that Almighty king? But let vs trye if thys be true if we may credite giue: It is not good nor reason wyll that we shall thys beleue. For what is man? a foolishe beast a creature full of spight And wretched farre aboue the reast if we shall iudge vpright. Who is not of hys nature nought? the way to vice is wyde, Wherin the feete of mortall men continually doth slyde: No warning, lawe, no payne, nor feare can cause them for to staye. Againe the path of vertue is a straight and painefull way, Wherin but fewe doe vse to walke and them you must constraine. Who is wyse? the woman? or the childe? or all the Coblers trayne? The most (alas) are foolish doltes in darkenes blinde we tread, And fonde affection beares the sway by which we all are lead. For none at all or fewe there be (whom he that guides the skye Hath chosen to himselfe alone) thys reason ruled by. For who can now beholde or how may leysure we obtaine, Wherby we might searche out y? trouth that secrete doth remaine? Cares pulles vs back: the greatest part of lyfe in slepe doth wast. The rest doth payne or sycknesse let, or pouertie doth taste, And stouthfulnesse sometime doth hurt and pleasure oft annoy, Hereof springs fooles &amp; wysedome eke by this we not enioy For she with great continuall toyle and study long is got, And doth require a quiet minde that troubles hinder not The troubles of the state of man (if I remember well) Among my bookes the syxt I think before doth plainely tell: Of mischiefe, griefe, and foolishenesse alas this is the place, And darksome denne of Hell wherein all liue in wretched case But yet the grosse and common sorte doe neuer waye this thing, But in the middest of all their toyle the foolyshe knaues doe sing And gaping laffe doe not perceiue their owne calamitie, But are when paine doth plague them sore as ioconde as a Pye, And sodainely doth all forget so that some sweetenesse fall Hereby doth come forgetfulnesse that ryds them cleane from all. For nature wyse and prouident our state did well foresee In giuing vs so slender wyt for our commoditie. For if that wysedome were in vs what man coulde beare the stryfe, The cares, and tedious troubling toiles of thys our wretched lyfe. For sadnesse ioyned with carke &amp; care thys wysedome in doth bring, And nature seemes to Foster man with hope of hopelesse thing: Without the which eche man himselfe would couet to destroy. So hope and folly medicines be that nature doth employ For our behoue by sage aduise, least we by chaunce should faint, When many mischiefs swarming thick our wytlesse sense doth taint. And if no creature else excell thys man in hye degre, The chiefe Creator of the worlde what shall we thinke to be? Of Misers, Fooles, and eke of them by whom doth mischiefe spring: He shalbe calde a Lorde, a Prince a Father, guide, and King. O noble powre, O princely raigne, companions fine and braue, What wants ther now O God to thee? what sekest thou more to haue? Alone thou doste not now remaine, it well became thy Grace To frame so fayre a worlde as thys to make such creatures place. Let Heauen serue theyr only vse, the Starres, the Moone, the Sunne, The Ayre, the Earth, the surging Seas what else? it shalbe done. But straight they shall consumed be, and vanishe cleane away: As Snowe doth fade in sommers heate, or flowre in frosty day. What state haue they that doe consyst of bodye weake and frayle: What state haue they that in the space of so small tyme doe fayle? May we beleue the seas and earth alone replenished bee Which are compared to the skyes as nothing in degree, And if the mighty compast speare in minde thou well dost way thou shalt perceiue the smallest Starre more great as wysemen say Shall then so small and vile a place in many fishe contayne Such store of men, of beasts and foules and thother voide remaine? Shal skies and ayre their dwellers lack? he dotes that thinke th so And seemes to haue a slender wit for there are thousandes mo. That better state and better lyfe enioye and farre more blessed be. Moreouer if we will confesse the vnfayned veritie, This earth is place for man and beast: beyonde the clowdes, the ayre, And sacred skye, where peace doth raine and daye is alwayes fayre. The Angels haue their dwellings there whom though we cannot see (For pure and fyne theyr substance is) yet numberlesse they be. As thick as are the sandes in place where waters ebbe and flowe, As thick as stand the flowers and grasse that in the meddowes growe. For who so thinks the Heauens hye of dwellers voide to be, And may vpon thys earth so vyle so many creatures se: He dotes deceiued by ignorance, and foolishnesse of minde, And semes all drounde in earthly drosse, as beastes of basest kinde. Nor wonder I at thys a whit that happye Ilandes founde In Occean seas they say there be where all things good abounde, Whereas no griefe the lyfe doth vexe, where no misfortunes raygne. The skyes perchaunce the Occean sea to name doth here retaine, Bicause in colour lyke it seemes and eke in mouing rounde, Eche Starre an Ilande shall be thought why not? haue we not founde That diuers houses are so calde bicause that farre away They seuered from their fellowes lye who otherwyse doth say He sayth not true, for if there were such Ilandes in our seas The Princes would not suffer them to passe their lyfe in ease: But weapon strayght should conquest make to enlarge theyr kingdomes hye If any passage were to them themselues therin to lye. What doubteth Grece to fayne or lye the mother olde of toyes? For doubtlesse Heauen, Starres, &amp; ayre inhabitaunts enioyes. Who thys denyes doth malice much the blessed saintes on hye, And eke the eternall state of God doe blaspheme foolishlye Is it not wicked blasphemie presumpteously to saye? That Heauen lackes inhabitants and God doth beare no sway, But here with vs and sauage beastes so fonde so full of shame, Nay certainely God coulde and woulde more noble creatures frame, That leade theyr lyfe in better place whereby hys prayse esteemde Should be the more and larger power and world more perfect deemde. For making s?dry sorts &amp; nobler things the beautie more doth shine Of this same worlde and more appeares his Maiesty diuine. But if these shapes be pure and voide of body coms the dout, Or whether they consist of partes as we doe rounde about. Yes truely reason doth declare all creatures that doe dwell In fyre, and ayre, they bodyes haue. if they had not, aswell The ayre and fyre should desert be, and places voyde should growe For none but bodyes place possesse as wyse mens wordes doe showe. But whyther shall these bodyes dye? we must confesse it so A long and ioyfull lyfe they leade at length with death they go, For if that ayre and fyre in tyme corruption shall deface, Why should not all such creatures dye as liue in such a place? For placed things doe followe still the places nature playne. But some perchaunce desyres to knowe what fashion they retayne, We may be sure theyr beauty is such that they doe farre excell All creatures fleeting in the seas or all on earth that dwell: Which neyther God permittes nor we coulde view with carnall eye, But they that passe theyr life in starres, and in the purest skye, Doeneuer dye for age nor yeares cannot the strength abate, Of those so gorgeous glistring starres or harme the heauens state. And eke we must beleue that those which liue in skyes so bryght Theyr bodies are more fayre, more fine, of greater force, and might, Then all the reast that liue betweene the earth, and Starres aboue: Or in the elements dwell where time and age can them remoue: But what doe they? they doe reioyce with sense and reason right, Now vsing one, and now the other and liue in such delight, As wit of man cannot deuise, nor mortall tongue can tell. True worlde, and true estate is there, true ioyes, and treasures dwell: We only haue the shadowes here and counterfaytes retayne, Which lasting but a little space lyke waxe doe melt againe. Our worlde is but a figure plaine of those so princely powres, And as our worlde the painted Mappe, so it surmounteth outes. Aboue these Heauens that we name and creatures all beyonde, A better worlde vncorporate that senses doth transcende And wyth the minde alone is seene there are that think to be, And with thassured trouth it seemes not much to disagre, If minde excelleth farre the sense why should the sense beholde A worlde alone wyth perfect things and creatures many folde. And minde without his proper worlde a Cyphar should remayne And none but dreames and fansyes find with shapes and shadowes vayne. Thus eyther nothing is the minde, or else hath nature wrought A worlde agreing to the same wherein containde are thought Unfained, chiefe, and purest things which better farre away May of themselues consyst th? things that senses compasse may. This same first framed world doth passe the world that senses see, As much as minde excels the sense in perfecter degree: In which the chiefest lyght is God where saints as Starres appere, And therfore more &amp; str?ger things are there then are perceiued here, Syth it is perfecter by much for nothing there doth dye, No tyme, nor motion, there hath rule all fixed continually, As voide of place and safe from harme they all doe seeme to be, There are the causes of eache thing, and springes of all we see. The worlde that senses may perceiue from thys same worlde doth spring, And semeth here a figure sure, and shaddowe of that thing: All things more perfect there and all things whole appere, We haue but portions of the same which are encreased here By natures fault and great deffect. so heartes a number be, For vertue one aboue creates the hearts that here we see By hir the subtill Foxe is framde by hir the Lyons liue, And so of all the other beastes, that thys our worlde doth giue, Which seeme in number diuers sortes but all are one in kinde That from these powers at first to come are euery one assinde. None otherwyse than Carpenters in Cities great of name, Eche one applying well hys worke doe diuers matters frame. Wherfore this world doth st?d of parts the other doth consyst Of al, and liuing by themselues of distance as they list But some haue thought y? euery Starre a worlde we well may cal, The earth they count a darkned starre wheras the least of all The God doth raine that vnderneath the clowdes hath placed his chaire That fosters all the creatures here in seas, in earth and ayre A Lorde of shadowes and the guide of shapes that liuely bee To whom is delt the charge of things and rule of all to see. Which for bicause they doe not last but passe with tyme away Doe scarse deserue the name of ought but shadowes that decay. The same is Pluto as I iudge, of whome the Poets olde, Do often syng, and say that he, the Kingdome black doth holde. For vnderneath the cloudes is night, aboue are al things cleare, Where light doth last for euermore, and brigthnesse styll appeare. To him as to the worst of all, thalmighty Lord dyd giue The vilest raigne, the rest more good, in better starres to liue. But yet is no man sure of this, for who doth know so wel, Gods mysteries? who hath bene there, and turnde agayne to tell. No state of man to such, our minde doth faynt in things so hie: The Owle cannot beholde the Sunne, wyth pure and perfect eye. Eche one presuming of his wyt, inuenteth matters newe, But Poets specially, to whome most confidence is dewe: For they may by autority of any matters write: Wyth Bacchus rage they moued be, and wyth Apolloes sprite. Though nothing is that doth forbyd the mad man truth to say, Sibylla vsed to tell the trouth, in madnesse as she lay. Let this suffise (my promisse kept) to proue that numbers be Of creatures farre excelling vs, which no mans eyes can see: Yet do they liue and reason vse, and as some wyse men say, Such are our soules departed once, that neuer shal decay. So Plato, so Pythagoras, and so Plotinus thought, And so haue many Poets erst, in pleasaunt verses wrought. Therefore it semeth labour worth (a thing most mete to tel) Of this for to entreat at large, for what doth more excel? Than throughly man to know himselfe: for children vnderstand Whereof the Body doth consyst, euen earth, of slyme, and sand. But harde it is so plaine to knowe the nature of the minde, Wherfore presuming on my Muse with all the force I finde Bestowing all my wits thereon I will attempt to knowe The perfect nature of the same, and plaine in verses showe. That done forsaking Libra soone Scorpius, thy crooked sygne I entre wyll, and destenie thy fatall force define If destiny doe not depriue our Port of hys wyll And for bycause in doubtfull things to bring the greater styll The methode and the order best is plainely to begin, With such as are assured most so wyll I doe herein, For if the fyrst beginnings here shall seeme obscure in syght, The sequele shall vncertaine seeme and in the worser plight If slender the foundation be in small tyme and space, We shall beholde the buildings fayle that we thereon doe place. The effects more plaine and manifest than causes seeme to be At them therfore we wyll begin and all things open see. With mouing nowe (for euerything that lyfe remayneth in Doth moue alone, first sygne of lyfe) therfore we will begin. For of it selfe the bodyes restes and members rottes away The cause (perhaps) that moues is heate or bloud that beares the sway. But things aliue are often styll when as they list to rest Though heate &amp; bloud in them abound, therfore appereth best That wyll is cause of mouing here yet sometimes they desyre To moue and cannot stirre therefore doth mouing both require The one commaunds, the other works, for wyll can nothing doe If power doe lack. But how commes it that men moue to and froe? Bicause (minde teaching) wil seeth good and mouing straight doth turne To that it sees, as Fyrre is drawn by that which makes it burne. Lyke as the yron from his place the Lodestone vpwarde drawes, And as the Aumber lyfteth vp the lyttle slender strawes: The worlde in such a wondrous sorte the Almighty Lorde did frame, That many things doe well agree as ioyned in the same, And many things doe disagree and kepe continuall fight, Wherby some men haue surely thought that strife, and frendeship might Be iustly calde beginnings chiefe, by which are all things wrought, Thus good first moued by which y? mind to motion quickly brought, Doth moue the partes &amp; pricketh forth the body here and there: But yet we think suffiseth not one good to all things here Nor one desyre to all alyke: so thys some that estemes And euery one retaines hys ioy as best to nature seemes. The Childe we see desyres the thyngs that aged men forsake, For as the bodyes seeme to be so minde and wyll doe take: Wherfore we sometime couet thys, and sometime long for that, And that which late we did esteme we now doe seeme to hate. Bicause our chaunging body is disposed diuerslye, And drawes the nature of the minde the way that it doth wrye. Hereof comes thyrst, and hunger sharp, and lust to Ladyes lappes. The body many things doe change as age, or tyme, or happes, As also meate, and drinke, sometymes and ayre doth chaunge it quite, And Starres doth alteration make as learned men doe write. Wherfore nothing in syght alone but state of body here Doth cause vs diuers thyngs to wyll and moues, it doth appere. But some by reason rather ledde, doe walke as she doth shew, And onely are by vertue drawne: but such are very fewe. For fleshly fonde affections here the minde doe ouerrunne, None otherwyse than mistes doe darke the cleare and shining Sunne. Lo this the cause why body moues. the mouing force of minde, Whom moued wil doth stil commaund obayes as is assinde. And in the partes that quyet are if nothing them doe let Is poured out and causeth them now here now there to iet. But why should labour weary them whereof should this aryse? As faynting feete in trauaile, and the akyng arme oft tryes. The cause hereof, is bloud resolued by force of feruent heate, (For to much mouing it inflames) decayes in fuming sweate. None otherwyse than Feuers fierce the creature pale consumes. When bloud or other humor hote thorowout all the members fumes Doth lyfe support and body feedes, which whylest it quickning makes, The mouing force possessing all the body quiuering shakes The heate and heated bloud besyde doth brede a liuely spright: As waters warmde w? beames of S?ne doe yelde a vapour light. Thys spirite enclosed within the bowels Thorowe all the vaines doth ronne, And nere to hir doth serue the lyfe in what she will haue donne. But those in heauy sleepes that lye how should they mouing make? As some doe in theyr steepes aryse and weapon vp doe take, Some in the stable takes hys horse, some wrytes as many say, And some hath earst bene seene a sleape vpon the Lute to play. It must be knowne that of the thing the Image doth remaine In vs, of all that we doe see, or senses can retaine. Thys makes vs think we see the face that late we gased on, And that we seeme to heare the wordes were vtred long agone. These formes within the secrete celles inclosed in the brayne, A vapour moues, which to ascende the stomack doth constraine And minde deluded so doth moue, the body styrres thereby, If the resemblance be of force that in the head doth lye. But tayle of Lysart, or of Snake that cut in two doth sprawle, Doth will it moue? Or force of minde? that Greekes doe fansye call, As they whom rage of madnesse moues, or to much drinke arayes, Or dreadfull dreames do cause to shake: or happens other wayes. Perchaunce amongst the knotty partes of thys deuided tayle, The liuely spirite enclosde doth searche all meanes for to preuayle, In breaking out and wynding partes doth wrye as best it may, And striuing long through passage smal doth get at length away. Or that same part of minde that feeles deuided doth remaine In tayle cut of, and causeth it to turne and turne againe. Yet I suppose that euery thing wherein no iudgement lyes Can feele no griefe, nor nothing else that we can here deuise. For chiefest force by which we feele from knowledge euer flowes. who knowes &amp; iudgeth most feeles most and most reioysing knowes. But fooles and doltes care lesse for all, lesse harmde, lesse fearing styll, They feele not colde, nor heate so much scarce know they good from ill. Not for bicause it smartes, therfore the tayle deuided shakes, For nought it feeles, bicause the str?gth from which it knowledge takes Is not in it, but in the head in better place did lye. Wherfore the former cause I iudge the trouth to go more nye. Lo, thus therfore is mouing made by which all creatures go. Yet in the reasons past before we put thys one thing to, That sundry times the present good when it might be atchieued Doth nothing moue, nor is desyred bicause tis not perceiued Thus knowlege semes of mouing cause or chiefest as we see: For who desyres, or sekes the thing he knowes not what to bee? For will hir selfe of proper force, is altogither blinde, And cannot any thing desyre without the light of minde: By whom if she be not enformde she takes the vntowarde way, And with the shewe of good beguilde hir vertue doth decay. Of mouing this shall here suffise, nowe let vs seeke to knowe How liuing things doe waxe so great, what causeth them to growe, And why at certayne tyme they cease. a fiery spirite doth raine Thou giuest lyfe to euery thing, that carcasse doth contayne. This heate doth liuely moisture feede, as flame of Candell bright (When soone withdraw himself fr? vs) the Oyle preserues in light. Thys in the stomack boyles the meate wherof the finest spread Abrode, the synowes, bones, and fleshe, wyth pyth, and bloud are bread. And all the body doth encrease as plantes wyth showers of rayne, And warmth of S?ne them comforting doth ryse and spring amaine. If that this fyre be much of force and moysture equall here As much as heate shall seeme to nede the encrease shall great appere. At length it makes an ende and stayes when spent is all the heate, Which fading body fades, as shewes in them whose yeares are great, For wasted they lyke pyned Ghostes their aged lymmes doe crooke And stouping low wyth hollowed eye vpon the earth doe looke. For fyre is gone, and liuely heate, and moysture doth decay, Without the which no lyfe remaines: as Lampes no longer may Giue out their light than oyle doth serue but leaues, and darkenesse brings. Then let vs now the mouing shewe of minde and whence it springs, A thing both darke, and harde to fynde, but yet we will assay With all our force to touch the trouth as nere as well we may. And fyrst of rage, that boldneth men, and daungers doth despyse, Encreaseth strength and giueth force, as much as shall suffise, Which mouing all as desperate vpon our foes we flye, And bloudy battaile to beginne with sworde in hast we hye. The cause therof is bloud enflamde, and heart that sendes out fyre, And bitter galle abrode disperst for Galle is house to yre, And choller matter ministers to rage and fury blinde, Hence comes that creatures lacking gal are not of wrathfull minde, Embracing peace, refuse to fight, but they whose bloud doth burne, And greater rage of heate retaine, to anger sonest turne. So youth, and so such dronken mates whose heads hath drink diseased, Upon a smallest cause doe snuffe, the minde therfore displeased Doth bloud and choller myngle straight then hande for weapon calles, And skirmishe comes, thus cuts are carued, and wounde wyde open falles. For fyrst the minde offended is, and vexed by iniury, Which troubled, moues y? body straight by these it semes they lye That say the minde can neuer styrre, for if it neuer moue, The body styll to stande and staye it alwayes doth behoue: For diuers mouings doe declare a diuers mouer playne The Sunne doth oft? change in course and shaddowes change againe. What is the cause that Organs giue now one now other voice? But hande y? shyftes from diuers kayes doth cause a diuers noyse. The minde affection inwarde fyrst doth take and close concele, And makes some part or other serue when she wyll it reuele: Disclosing straight to it whatsoeuer within in secrete lyes, To thende that plaine it may appere and open to the eyes. None otherwyse than when the king vnto his faithfull frende Declares the secretes of hys minde and after doth it sende To be proclaimed in euery place that it may plaine appere. Hence springeth loue for wh? the minde doth fansye pleasant gere. She makes the heart a minister and so doth loue declare, In heart, loue, wrath, feare, lust, &amp; hope, wyth ioye, and also care As in a tower with minde doe dwell and these as there begonne By meanes of other partes through al the body forth do runne. But of this same in other place, more playnly shal we write, If God therein do fauour vs, and Muses graunt vs sprite. Suffiseth now affections fyrst of al things else to be Wythin the minde, the causes sprong, of things wythout we see, And after they by member, bloud, or other humours might, Are spread abrode in euery parte, and so thrust out to light. For seing minde and body are ioynde, the mouing nedes must be Common to both, the harmes al one, and chaunge in like degree: Whatsoeuer thing the one perceyues, the other feeleth it, They both in nature doe agree, so strongly are they knitte. But now bycause we seeme to touch, the typ of Scorpions toe, Let vs, my Muse, of senses speake, here briefly as we goe: Fyue senses nature gaue to such as perfect creatures be, But vnto some he delt not all, which may be worthely Unperfect namde, as Moles, &amp; wormes and Scallops of the baye, And Wilks, &amp; Irchin eke whom pricks incompast rounde araye. Among these senses al, the syght is thought the best to bee, Bicause it is the chiefest meanes wherwith the minde doth see, Declaring plaine the wondrous workes that nature here doth frame such floures, such fruits, such herbs, such beasts, such plantes, such stones of name, Such sundry sortes of mettalles fayre, and shewing also plaine, What Fyshes Proteus feedes in seas, what Monsters there remaine, And more than thys the stately roomes wherein the Gods doe lye The glistering globes of starres aboue and Phœbus shining hye: Besydes the things that men doe heare that tongue can not displaye, Thys sense therfore doth all excell and fayrest farre away: In which the seate and chiefest place wherin the minde doth dwell Is thought to be, for when we meete or talke in presence tell, Upon the others eyes we gase as man, and minde, and all Did there consyst, who so the eyes the glasse of minde doth call Shall say the truth, for pleasaunt loue in them doth fyrst gyue lyght: There hate and fiercenesse doth appere with mylde and gentle sprite: There sadnesse, ioy and mischief shewes with zeale and wysedome great, And follye, pride, and feare and rage, with fault and wrathfull heat. But wherof doth the syght proceede? the mindes let other see Of learned men, I briefely shewe as I think best to be. One lyfe there must be knowne to be of substance eke so fine, As syght can neuer comprehende of force and power diuine. Which nature deales &amp; God doth giue: thys feedes and makes to growe, Doth breed, doth moue, doth heare, &amp; tast doth smell, see, feele, and knowe: Which is the chiefe and greatest power most nere to saints on hye. These powres she through y? body spreds in certaine partes to lye, And by the eyes doth lyght let in, and sundry coulers see, And iudgeth playne of euery shape, and all things else that be: Receaueth also by the nose the smelles of sundry sort, And by the eares doth vnderstande sounde noyse and great report. By tongue descernes eche kinde of tast, by feling knowledge brings Of hote from colde, of harde from soft, of rough from smothest things. Companions fyue these are to lyfe, and faithfull seruants sure, That shewes hir all, without the which she nothing coulde procure. The eyes therfore as glassye made and as the Christall clere, Lyke as a glasse receyue the shapes that we doe looke on here, By power wherof are things desernde if that the eye be sounde. These sorts of things vnto the minde (for as in hyghest grounde Hir stately seate in head she holdes) the eye doth plainely showe, Whose ymage truely shadowed there she wyse doth straightwayes knowe, So wondrously she doth perceiue a sundry sort of soundes, When in the helthy vnharmed eares the ayre therof reboundes. For ayre of slendrest substance is and moueth by and by, Which beaten with the noise doth sh?ne and from the stroke doth flye, And pearcyng breakes into the eares, though close be kept the glasse, And close the dore, so fine it is that inwarde it will passe. For euen the fyshe when fyshers harde with poales the floudes doe plashe, For feare of noyse flye fast from thence and thick in nettes doe mashe. For ayre to depth of seas doth pearce vp mountes the waues thereby, And tempests roares w? dreadfull noyse, the shipman out doth crye, And vowes to offer sacred giftes: As oft therfore as wee Doe finde two things togither knockte, as oft as ayre we see Moued vehemently, but chiefly then, when through these hollowed things By narrowe straightes it passeth out, thence diuers voices springs: As diuers are the sortes of them, as place doth fashion take: In which the ayre doth sundry soundes and sundry voices make. So soundes the Trumpet otherwyse by farre than shalme doth blowe, And well we may the Tymbrels tune from sounde of sawtrey knowe. For as by stroke of stone in streame doe many cyrcles ryse So moued, the ayre, w? whirling wheele doth spread in largest guise. And therfore into many eares one voice doth easely passe As where a number be, one syght is seene in euery glasse. But how the nose receiueth smell let vs say something here. A slender fume from euery thing arisyng doth appere, Which broade in ayre doth spred it selfe as Frankconcense we see, Or Myrrhe, if that vpon the coales the powder poured bee. By meanes of tongue is taste perceiude and roufe of mouthe besyde, For by these twaine the taste &amp; smatche, of euery thing is tryde, Which pearcing straight doth touch the sense therof is taste begonne. But feeling, bloud and sprite procures which through the bodye runne. Thys sense doe creatures all possesse and taste they all receiue: But man doth better them enioye and them more right perceiue. Hereof to man more wysedome doth than to the rest aryse: Some thys denye and saye the things foresayde are otherwyse, Alowing not that formes receyued in eyes, cause syght to be, Or that the ayre we neede, as meane to heare, or for to see. For the almighty King doth giue so many powers to minde As in the world he framed things, that varie in their kinde. That she might al things comprehend, she knowes wel what to be, Hir proper kinde, and more perceyues. Minde al things plaine doth see, And al things ponders prudently that senses to hir brings, And wyth celestial trial wayes the true and vertuous things. To Lyfe therefore is minde the Sunne, the senses Starres doe seeme: So some affirme, but we make haste and leaue these things to deeme, To other men, for nye we come to ende of Libra here, Bycause the feete of Scorpion signe do playnly now appere. My sayings yet do plainly teach, the soule Celestiall To be, which voyd of body liues, and giueth lyfe to all, Discerning also euery thing as farre as God giues leaue, For al things here, of him their force determinde do receyue. To him eternal power belongs, al things doth he create, And makes al things that here ar made through his almighty state. For if the soule perceaues and knowes, and vnderstandeth al, We may not thinke it substance such, as we may body cal. Syth bodies moue, not earth nor ayre, not floud nor fyry flame, Nor any thing that these haue made, hath power as hath this same. we neede not doubt but soule proceedes, and doth from Ioue discend, And neuer dyes whome he permits, the world to comprehend. What if so be the Atornyes that sundry wise men fayne, The soule is rather thought to be, than body to maintayne, Al Bodies be of quantity, and may deuided be, But soule is vndiuidable and of no grosse degree, And as a Center doth she seeme, where many lynes do mete, Which senses do conuey to hir, as floudes to seas do flete. Wherefore I maruel much at such, as thinke a like decay, And iudge the soule no more to be when body fades away. For if so be it might be proued, yet should it not be sayd, Nor published to the common sort, nor euery where displayed. For many wicked men and yll there are, which if they thought Their soules as nothing shall remayne, when corse to graue is brought, Nor that it feeles, or suffers ought, when it goeth hence away, And that no punishment remaynes for prancks that here they play, A thousand mischiefs would they doe, take feare from them among, And fall to euery villany confounding right wyth wrong. Besydes a number now that thinke in blessed state to be, When death hath them destroied, &amp; hope the face of God to see, And euermore wyth him to ioy, and therfore vertuously Do seke to passe their present lyfe, wyth Godly modesty: If they shall see that after death, do no rewardes remaine, Amased al, their vertuous workes, shall ceasse and perishe playne. So many stately temples trimmed, so many altares hie, Wyth golde and marble garnished and decked sumptuously, Besyde Religion, Godly zeale, honour, and worshipping Of God, shal come to nought, if af- ter death remayne nothing That men hope for, if that the soule as winde doth passe away. Of wilde, and franticke common sorte Religion must be stay, And feare of smart. For mischieuous, and full of fraude theyr brayne Is alwayes seene, nor of themselues they well doe meane or plaine. The common people vertue loath, and euermore doe hate. Religion is the comelinesse, and glory of our state, Which makes the Gods to fauour vs, which we winne Heauen by. No wyse nor good man therfore dare attempt here openly, To teache y? soule shall come to naught, and so corrupt the mindes Of rude vnskilfull common sort, that wauer lyke the wyndes. Now must we proue by reason good that soule doth neuer dye, And free from sting or darte of death doth liue eternally: As he that preacheth Christ declares, and Greshop eater Iewe, That for synnes vtterly despysed: which God that all things knewe Would not haue made if he had thought it had bene nedelesse here: And nations all with one consent account it to be clere. And first the thing resembling most the mightyest Lorde of al, Of longer lasting tyme we graunt and perfecter must call. For that which doth not long endure but shortly doth decay, That it should be vnperfecter who is that will say nay? And therefore doe celestiall things a greater whyle endure, Bicause they are more perfecter, and more diuine and pure: But things that nerer are to earth and farthest of from skyes, Unperfect since they are, do fade and sonest euer dyes: Shall then our soule synce it in lyfe and knowledge doth appere, Most lyke vnto the state diuine, be closed and shut vp here With body for to ende? nor shall it here haue longer place Than fading fleshe? or shall it liue more great nor larger space? Besydes the soule can not decay, thys reason wytnesse shal, Bycause it is of syngle state, and voyd of matter al. Adde this, that when the body fades, the force of minde doth growe, As weake and aged fathers olde, do more of councell know Than youthful blouds of yonger yeres, and often lacks he wit That doth excel in strength and force: For rare doth God permit To any one both strength and wyt. Wherefore if force brought low, By space, and course of many yeares, the minde doth stronger grow, Of Body doth it not depend, but of it selfe consist Another thing, and after graue doth lyue and death resist. Doth not besyde when fote doth ake the minde iudge thereof playne? It is no doubt. But how can griefe to towre of minde attayne, Doth it ascend from lowest partes as smoke doth vpward flye? No: for many partes not foote alone, (if so) should ake thereby, Nor of the foote, but of the parte that nerest is to minde The ache shuld grieue: this shewes that soule is not of bodies kinde: And so is free from death since it in distance needes no meane. Adde this when wee would cal to minde the thing forgotten cleane, Or else deuise some worthy fetche, from minde, the senses al It then behoues to gather vp, whereby doth often fal That many better for to muse, do shut and close their eyes, Or else forsaking company, some secret place deuise. Or when the night with darksome cloud the earth doth ouerspred, And creatures all wyth heauy sleepes, do take their rest in bed, They styll do watch, and silent al, vpon their beds do rest, And light put out, in darknesse whet their minde wyth body opprest. For senses do the minde disturbe, affections it destroyes, Amasing it wyth dulnesse great, and blindnesse it anoyes: None otherwyse than cloudes do hyde the Sunne that clearly shynes. If therfore, when it doth remayne wythin his owne confines, And flying farre from senses al, and cares that body brings, It wyser be, then shal it knowe and vnderstand al things In better sort, when it is free, and from the flesh doth flye, More perfect of it self it is, and lyues continuallye. Besyde when man as meane consystes, the Saints and beastes betwixt, Some parte wyth eche he c?mon holdes wyth beastes his body mixt, And wyth the saintes his minde agrees: one of these partes doth dye, Of the other Death can haue no power, but liues continuallye. Death therfore takes not al away, for why? his deadly dartes, Doth neuer harme the soule a whit when it from body partes. And more than thys I haue to say, if nothing doe remaine Of vs, when carcasse lyes in tombe, God shall be called plaine Uniust, and one that fauour shewes to such as naughtly lyue: For such for terme of all their lyfe, no sorrowes them doe grieue, No riches lacke nor pleasures great, but happily reioyce, Exalted with promotions hye, and wyth the Commons voice. On the other syde the vertuous men a thousande griefes molest, Now sore diseased, now plagued w? nede in fine alwayes opprest. Therfore the soule liues after graue, and feeles deserued paynes, And if it haue done iustly here a Crowne of glory gaines. By these and many other wayes I coulde declare no doubt, That soule of man doth neuer dye, and body liues without. But thys ynough: time biddes me ende nor ignoraunt am I, That soule of many (although vnapt) is termde a melodye. And as of sundry voices moued an harmony proceedes, Of sundry compoundes medcyne made which force of healyng breedes: So of the ioyned elaments by certayne meane and way Created, of the heauens eke the soule to be some say: A part wherof in body dwels and part abrode doth lye: As syght doth spring of outwarde lyght and vertue of the eye. For Heauen is the chiefest cause from which all things doe spring, wythout whose ayde y? earth coulde not, nor seas breede any thing. But thys opinion is not true, for if it should be so, The soule with flesh should neuer striue, nor once against it go, But euermore in one agree. As euery powre doth showe, That wonted are of myxed things by sprite diuine to growe. As in the kinde of hearbs apperes, and in the precious stone. Some think the soule doth not remaine when fleshe is from it gone, Bicause that heauy, sluggishe sleepe the nerest thing that may Resemble death, doth seeme to take both sense and minde away: Or for bycause they see the minde wyth sycknesse diuersly So vext, and harmde, that it can not the place it hath supply, And with the body to encrease wyth which it eke decayes. As well apperes in children yong and men of elder dayes: Fonde is the childe, the man discrete, the olde man doteth styll For weake vnweldy wythered age doth minde and body spyll. And more say they if that the soule of substance be diuine, And seured from these fleshly lyms may leade a lyfe more fine, Then why should it in wretched fleshe so seeke it selfe to place? By whose defect so many yls and mischiefe it deface. But fonde she is therfore if that she doe this willingly, And if perforce she be compelde in carcasse caued to lye who doth c?straine? Doth God himself? then hir he naught esteemes: Nay which in prison vile he puts to hate he rather seemes. More of it selfe (except it learne,) synce it doth nothing knowe, And oftentimes forgetfulnesse the minde doth ouerthrowe. Therefore they iudge it nothing is when body here doth dye, For learne it cannot, senses deade, which it knowes all things by. Some other say that soule there is in all the worlde but one, Which giueth lyfe to euery thing, as Sunne but one alone There is, that makes all eyes to see eternall, think they this Though bodyes dye as eyes put out the Sunne eternall is. These trifles fonde it is not harde wyth reason to disproue: But here I longer am I feare than it doth me behoue. There shal not want that such dema?ds shall aunswere once at full, And all the doubtes therin assoyle and knots asunder pull. O man of sharpe and pregnant wyt, thy prayse shall liue with mine, Our labours (doubt not) shall c?mende the men of later time: They famous worke attempt, &amp; seedes of Heauen on earth go sowe. This one thing will I more put to, that euery man may knowe The soule immortall for to be, and sprong of heauenly grace, If senses and affections all he will restraine a space. If that dispisyng worldly ioyes, and earthly thoughtes resynde wyth dayly labour he attempt to God to lyfte hys minde: Then perfect wisedome shall he haue, and things to come foretell Awake, or else in heuye sleepes perceiue the same as well. In thys sort did the Prophetes olde the things to come declare. The sober minde therefore doth come more nere to heauenly fare, The farther from the fleshe it flyes, and from the earthly care. But lyke to beastes the greatest sort doe liue as sense doth wyll, And thinke none other good to be but fleshe to haue hys fill. Hereof it comes that many think the soule with body dyes, Bicause they see not things diuine with weake and fleshly eyes. But of the soule thys shall suffise: let vs returne againe To him that made the world, whom we conclude for to remaine Of body voide: and thousandes more that body liue without, As thick as in the woodes the leaues doe cluster trees about: And if they bodyes haue at all so purely are they finde, That sense of ours cannot perceiue but onely seene of mynde. But thou my Muse be silent here, and when hys wyll shall be And pleasure eke, who moues my lips, then shalt thou searche with me The cause of things, that vnderneath the cyrcle of the Moone We see to passe, if they by chaunce, or fatall force be done. And whylst while as the Sunne y? backe of Lyon flaming fryes, And doubling oft hir creaking voyce the Greshop chyrping cryes, Encompast with the shadowing grasse let vs finde out in shade Of Lawrell, or sweete Mirtle tree, where hushing noyse is made Of streames, that flowes from Parnas' springs a quiet resting place, For rest doth well refreshe the minde, and calles againe the grace. And straight when as wyth quietnesse our strength is come againe, I wyll (if thou wilt fauour me and me wyth grace mayntayne) Attempt to touch the stately tunes: and if the almighty King with countenance sweete do graunt me ayde, my labour long pitying, And pouerty driue farre from me, and bytter cares expel: Al wholly wyl I liue wyth thee, and alwayes wyth thee dwel. This onely shal be my delight, my selfe then shal I fyll Wyth pleasant Aganippæs streames, and syng on Cirphæs hyll. Scorpius, the eyght Boke. The cause why mortal state doth pas such croked c?trary wayes, Some sort in honour, happily do spend their ioyfull dayes: And other some in myserie, oppressed continually, Wyth dayly moyling vexed sore, in fame obscure do lye. Fayre Muse declare: for vnto thee it lawful is to knowe, The councels of the Goddes aboue, and secrets for to showe. Some men by blinde disordred chaunce, thinke all things done to be, Nor world by reason to be ruled, bycause they most things see Wyth vnderserued goods adourned, and most things plagued agayne Uniustly vext wyth noysome ils, and difference none to rayne: The iust and vertuous men opprest, and Rakehelles hiely placed, And vice than vertue more esteemed, and Churches al defaced, Wyth fyry flame of thunder cracks, and most men for to gayne, By synfull vsage of themselues, and craft of subtyle brayne: Such when they see to come to passe, the greatest parte surmyse, Eyther no Gods at al to be, or else that they dispise, The base affayres of mortal men, And only heauens minde: therfore they rash and blindely say, Uncertayne chaunce in euery thing doth beare the chiefest sway. But Fortune some to thee do giue the gouernance ouer al, And thee Lady chiefe of eue- ry thing on earth do cal, And that thou holdst the scepters here wyth browes that sowrely frowne, And wyth thy false vnstable wheele turnst al things vpsyde downe: To thee the olde deceyued age dyd buyld their altares hye, And often tymes before thy face, their sacrifice dyd lye. Some are besides that do impute eche thing to destenye, And iudge that force of fatall lawes, the world is ordred by, And that wyth one continual course (as pageants shewes to minde) Al things do moue, and euery man hath here his parte assinde, That he must play, tyl al be done: a question to be sought Right profitable fayre and hard, not to be left vntaught. Now fyrst therefore let vs declare, that nothing here can be Wythout a cause, and that the cause must of necessity, Much differ from the effect, synce that nothing it self doth breede, No thing can of it selfe be cause, nor of it selfe proceede. Then infinite shall causes growe? not so: but yet there ought Some fyrst to be, from which the rest of causes must be brought, Which from the hiest must descend, vnto the basest state. This order then of causes we cal Destenie or Fate: Which God as once predestining that all things should be so, Determinde hath by his decree for euermore to go. But as eche cause doth nerest come vnto the causer fyrst, So all the rest it doth excel, and moues, and rules the worst. The fyrst beginning is a cause and no effect the same, The lowest state is but effect, no cause we can it name: The meanes that are betwene these two may names of both retayne. For if of causes were no knot, nor order styll to rayne, If thone of thother shoulde not hang, (as if from heauens hye A Chayne to deepest part of Hell should hang and lincked lye: Which is to vyle to be rehearsed) beginnings more than one Shall seeme to be: and causes fyrst must many spring thereon. Then shal they stryue am?gst the?selues and often fiercely fyght, So many heads, for one alone doth rule require of right: So neyther world should here be one, nor beautifull should seeme: For ordre is the beauty chiefe, that we in things esteeme. But some perchaunce wyl say from one beginning fyrst of all, Togyther many causes seue- red downward often fall. As sundry sort of glistering beames the Sunne doth from him sende, With certaine difference seuered, of which doth not depende The one of the others force, but eache from selfe same head doe fall: So needes no strife, nor let, bycause one way they walke not all. Thys order is not very yll, nor much mislyketh me, This sentence may be fortune true: but let vs thorowly see, All blindenesse from our minde expelde, for minde of man cannot Attaine to lyght of trouth so sone, nor in such easy sort, But oftentimes doth vse to erre, and hereof doth aryse Such sectes, &amp; such contrary sawes, he proues, and he denies: As reason proper is to Gods, opinion is to vs, No certaintie hath mortall man the trouth for to discusse. Therfore if many causes be that from the fyrst doe flowe: If eche of them in perfectnesse be like, I seke to know: No order there shal then appeare, for where no chiefe doth guide No difference, nor diuersity seene, no order can be spyde. In euery thing thou mayst perceyue a first, a mydst, and last, No kind of thing is here that is wythout an order cast. But if they al do not alike this perfectnesse auowe, God hath some thing vnperfect made: this can not I allowe. Wherefore one perfect good effect allowe the causer fyrst, The rest haue more vnperfecter, as they themselues are worst. For commonly most store of fruite, the naughtiest tree doth bring But worst, as yll than good, and sowre than sweete doth ryfer spring. For as eche cause is more of power and of estate more hye, So more of lyfe and reason hath this purest substance nye. The cause agayne of weaker force, and of a baser kinde, Lesse lyfe, and reason doth possesse, and substance lesse doth fynde. As well vpon the earth appears, wher al things do endure But little space, where reason is scarce, where no estate is pure: But all of many things consistes, al things on earth that bene, Compounded are, and myxt, so that no substaunce can be sene: Nor here she is esteemde a whit, the honour doth remayne, To such as hir do here enioy, and such as hir retayne. In darkesome caues she hidden lyes, and hereby do we fynde, That fortunes goods are more estemde than vertues of the minde. For substance vertue may be calde, but in this worlde exilde This substaunce liues, hir co?trey fayre hir seate and mansion milde, The heauens are, where as she hath hir faythfull frendes of trust, Goodnesse, &amp; truth. By this meanes tho the world is framed iust, Of causes as before is sayde preseruing euery thing with during bond, this chaine (but God) may none in peeces bring, Nor force, nor space of tyme it breake. Of causes such is sponne, What is to come, what present is, and what hath earst bene donne, To al the which theyr force, and str?gth, thalmighty king aboue with certain boundes, &amp; tune appointes by certayne meanes to moue. And needefull is it to be knowen how, many causes runne To gather oft when any thing by force of them is donne. Nor rashely is thys meeting made, and causes mixed so, But by appointed destenyes, all things doe passe, and go Thalmighty workeman of the worlde hath all things vndercast Assured lawes, and measure delt to all the things he past. Therefore it is not true that some affyrme, and dare defende, That nothing certayne can be founde, that chance doth all things sende: And God regards not mortall state. But they themselues deceaue, And are beguiled much, to whom thys sentence here doth cleaue. For truely chance is nothing else but vaine opinion blinde, Not diffring much fr? shapes, &amp; syghtes that in our sleepes we fynde. Whatsoeuer Aristotel sayth, or any of them all, I passe not for, synce from the truth they many times doe fall. Oft prudent, graue, and famous men, in errors chance to slyde, And many wittes wyth them deceiue when they themselues go wyde: Examples only serue, so much must errors folowed bee. Let no man iudge me arrogant, for reason ruleth mee, She faithfull guide of wysemen is: let him that seekes to fynde The trouth, loue hir, and followe hir with all hys might, and minde. And that there is no chaunce at all thys reason strong and stayde, Makes me beleue: for if that all (as earst before is sayde) By causes fixed in certaine guise, and certayne time doe moue As God commaundes, for perfectnesse, and for the worldes behoue, Least hurtfull error should destroy so fayre a worke as it, what kind of place shall cha?ce possesse, or seate finde out to syt? In doubtfulnesse, and altering state surmounting farre away Both Protheus, and Vertumnus to, in changing theyr aray, As voide, so nature chance denies. Uncertaine nought doth lye Within thys worlde, but certaine all: as nature, God, and skye, And elaments, and what of them so euer framde we see, Or hath in tyme before bene wrought, or euermore shall be. But if that ought vncertaine were, then should the minde diuine, Not all things here knowe certainely, but from the trouth decline: Which were to great absurditie, for he doth all things spye That eche thing makes, nor ought from him can hyd in secret lye. Though some doe say that if so be that heauenly minde shoulde knowe The base estate of mortall kinde, it should lesse worthy growe. But they are much deceiued, for none is ill bycause that hee Doth ill things know, nor vile y? knowes the things that vilest bee. Nor any man is changed white that white can well define, Nor worser is the Sunne as oft as it on knaues doth shine, Nor if with beames it hap to blase in place be durtyed much It foule doth seeme, nor light defylde that filthy things doth touche, So if the minde perceiue the thing that vylest may be thought, It is not worse, to knowe ill, than good, but ill to doe is naught. Thus God of nothing ignorant, all things that are doth knowe, What hath bene done in alder tymes, and what shall after growe. Which if they be not surely fixt confesse we must them needes Not to be knowne, for knowledge styll of things assurde proceedes. The Prophetes also when they speake of things that happen shall, The certaine dayes do playnly appoint, and proper names of all: Which would not be, but that al thyngs are fyxed certaine so That are to come, or present be, or passed long ago. Yet many things doe seeme by chaunce amongst vs for to lyght: As when a tyle by tempest torne from house a man doth smyte: Or when a man in deluing deepe doth store of treasure finde: Such things by cha?ce to hap, doth synk in common peoples minde. But thys my minde doth not alowe: for though vnlooked for Such things doe hap, shall we therein admit a chaunce therfore? Our knowledge, nor our ignorance, to alter things hath might: For fyre hath not his flaming heate, nor Snow therfore is whyte, Nor S?ne doth yeld hys glittering beames bicause we knowe the thing: For of the matters that consyst our knowledge here doth spring. Therfore we knowe it thus to be bicause the thing is so, And minde may often seeme to erre the thing can not so do. Now of the thing I speake and aske if chaunce therein doe lye, For whether we doe knowe thereof or no, regarde not I. The chaunce therefore in vs doth lye, not in the things that be, Such things we thinke to fall by cha?ce wherof no cause we see, As knowne alone vnto the Gods: all things are certaine tho. For with one sort of mouing rounde the heauens alwayes go, Lyke seede, like fruite, and elaments in auncient order rayne, And keepe their kinde, &amp; wonted course the yeare doth styll retaine. For after spring, the somer hoat himselfe hath strayghtwayes placde, And after him with Apples thyck and Grapes doth haruest hast, Next after that his nipping frostes the wynter bringeth in, And wyth his Isye northern blastes all things to droupe begin. No herbe doth euer change hys force, all creatures doe retaine Their olde accustomed shape, and in theyr wonted guise remaine. Ne must we thinke that monsters here of chaunce or errors growe, When cause of them assertaynde is ill tydings to foreshowe: And therof fyrst did take theyr name wherfore they wonders hyght, Which nature willingly doth make, who often doth delight To brede some fond ylfauoured things. As paynter oft doth ioy (Though he haue cunning great besyde) to paint some iesting toy: As pycture crooked, or saddelbackd, wyth nose of largest syse, And blabber lypt, a worthy syght and fit for clownishe eyes. Synce all things thus in order good, and measure lyke doe fall, Unstable chaunce within the world shall beare no swynge at all: whom chiefest prouidence of God, and wysedome great doth draw, That he may easely vnderstande with what a wondrous lawe The worlde with euerlasting course is framed here and gracde: How euery creature hath his lymmes, and members aptly placde, well seruing to their vses all agreing fayre the same, How God or nature neuer thyng in vaine did make or frame. who ponders this shal think not chance, but reason beares the sway, And al things done as God comma?ds, wyll deeme, and playnely say. But whether fortune guideth all as many doe persuade, A thing both meete, and worthy is in knowledge to be had. Let vs bende all our wyts to thys, but fyrst we must well knowe What kinde of thing thys fortune is, and whence hir grace doth growe. In auncient tyme they worshipt hir, and Goddesse hir did call, And thought she bare no little sway in Heauen and earth, and all: And alters vnto hir they built, and offred sacrifyce: But I thinke hir no God to be, nor any sainct in skyes, Is eyther male, or female sure, in kinde they not delight, No byrth they haue, nor dying day as some of olde doe wryte, Who thinke the Gods lyke vs to be. O fonde, and foolishe mindes, O heads for to be healed with iuice of greatest purging kindes. Iudge you the Gods, of our estate, that wyth theyr Ladies fayre Embracing many times they lye, theyr kinde for to repayre? Let rather vs therfore account a certaine God to be, Whose nature differs farre from Gods a Ghost of lowe degre, And therfore guides the kingdomes vile of earth and waters rounde, Wheras so many haynous factes, such griefes and plagues are founde, Where as no kinde of thing is safe, where no estate is free, where craftes and wyles doe swarme so thick, where such deceiuings be. The Prince of all the worlde, thys God is named of Christ, and Paule: Whom Pluto, and syr Dites black, the Poets vse to call: who fauours fooles, and wicked men, and vertuous men molest. This house, thys seate, this courte doth seme, for such a tyrant best, whom commonly we fortune call: for eche ill thing doth raine Beneath the Mone: as darksome night and stormes, and tempest mayne, Wyth colde and heate, and teasty age, dame neede of beggars hall, And labour, griefe, and wretchednesse, and death that endeth all. Aboue the Mone continual light, wyth peace and ioy remayne, No tyme, nor error, death nor age, nor any thing is vayne. O blest, and double blest agayne, that in so pleasaunt place, So fayre, so beautifull, to liue of God obtayneth grace. Some thinke the world to be fulfylde wyth other Gods besyde, Whereof the most do leade their lyfe in ayry places wyde, whom Greekes cal sprytes, &amp; more to th? the chiefest rule they giue Of creatures al, that on the earth, or on the sea do liue. Affirming that both good and euyl as most their mindes doth please They send, as honours, ioyes, &amp; wealth, and contraries to these. wherefore it very needeful is to please them often tymes, which may be done by seruing them, by charmes, or by diuines As many thinke, and likewyse say that they will straight appere To vs, (if they be ryghtly calde) and helpe vs praying here: And that no better thing can be here in this life to man, Than for to haue their company, and see them now and than: which I beleue but fewe obtayne but iust men that despise The fond and fading wanton ioies, and foode of fleshly eyes: That quietly do liue, and cares do banish farre away, And heauenly things alone do minde, and neuer seeke to stray From that, which right and vertuous is. Although that some do say, Ill sprites amongst these good there be, constrayned to obay To naughty men, by Coniuring, whereby much ill is done: I can not stay, nor now is place. the signe where as the sunne Doth yelde his yearly compast course, where sealed brethren shine Shall tell the rest, where as I wyll the state of Gods define, If God himselfe doe me permit who doth my verses gene. Let vs therefore passe ouer this. I scarely can beleue, That any God can euyl be. Wysdome byds neuer synne: But contrary, by folly doth fault, stray, and crime come in. No man is euil wyllingly as farre as I beleaue: For euery wyl doth couet good, if iudgement not deceaue. But Diuel wysdome hath, (if that this name to him agree.) But whether Fortune gouerne al, or howsoeuer it be, Or Diuels guide the state of men: yet wythout destenie Doth nothing passe, But al things rulde by minde of God on hie, Without whose power nothing is done: but of this saying here A doubt doth ryse, and knot so hard and sure doth eke appere, Such one as Hercules, or else the Macedonian King Would scarce vndoe, which doubt &amp; stay to many mindes doth bring. If destenie commaundeth al, if al things so must moue, Not wyl to vs remaineth free, nor to the Goddes aboue, Free wyll is taken cleane away, and vertue no rewarde, Nor vice doth punnishment deserue, which is not to be heard. No place is now of Gods to speake, but of such things as be In one estate, is subiect here, which eyes of men may see. I say therefore that in the things that vnder fortune be, No kinde of thing can here be founde, exempt from destenie: As riches, pleasures, ioyful minde, wyth rule and honours hye, Come from aboue: not wyl of ours is that we get them by. For who would not such things enioy? but wyll auayles not thoe, It rather hurts if destenies agaynst a man do go. How many striue to ryse aloft agaynst their destenie, But faster more and more they fal and downe they deeper lye. On thother syde they vnto whome the stars more gracious be, Unlooked for doe often liue in chiefe prosperity: Whose nettes while they themselues do sleepe, Rhamnusia ful doth fyll, Wyth fish, and bringeth vnto them al things that they can wyll. Loe, some of great and noble house, we see to come to light, And to enioy from childehode fyrst all things wyth ioyful spright, And to attayne to honour hye, though they vnworthy be, And blinded oft their eyes to rule that scarcely wel can see, And lyue in al licenciousnesse. And some of kinred base For to be borne, wyth griefe and teares themselues for to deface, wyth labour long and vayne, to toyle, and yet cannot expel The pricke of hunger that they feele but styl in beggrye dwel. who wyl denye these ylles to come, through cruell destnies might? A number fayre and actiue are and of couragious sprite: And many fowle, and syckly styl, of courage faynt we see: whereof c?mes thys? of our desertes? or our infirmity? Or shal we say, our wyl doth al? By Fates assuredly Eche thing doth chaunce to mortal men the rule hath Destenie: Of our affaires and our estate, the houre and kinde of death It only guides: a halter him, him sword depriues of breath, He drownde in floudes he kilde w? colde him strangleth fyry smoke, Some other hunger doth destroy, and some doth surfets choke, By griefe or sycknesse many dye, some, chaunce away doth send, And many age bereues of life: a certayne day of ende, To al men is, and euery age, nor longer can we go Than threede of life permits, that r?nes the spiteful spyndle fro. So kylde a rysh the prayser of Achilles lusty lore: So Aeschilus, while as he walkde abrode on Sicill shore, With stroke of Tortoys lost his life: Anacreon so did kill A reasons seede. Alas what wayes, what meanes hath death to spyl? When fardest of thou thinkest him, then nerest standeth be: Nothing than death more certayne can nor more vncertayne be. Yet some that know the force of starres, and secrets of the skye, Soothsaying Prophets that can tel, how things to come do lye: I knowe not with what sprite inspired, are often wont to tell, The kinde, and day, of death to come: for of the things aswell To come is nature sure, as of the present things and past, Sure in the fyrst and seconde cause that from the fyrst to th' last With largest lynke extended are. But goodes or illes of minde, Doe they proceede from desteny or from the fatall kinde? Learning and wit seeme thence to flow, may any learning get Except he wysedome doe obtaine and nature force permit If fortune let or sycknesse staye? An Oratour some one, An other a Philosopher, some alwayes looke vpon The sacred secretes of the Gods, and seeke the starry skye, And some there are y? drink the streames in wretched pouertye That from Castalian well doe flowe, whom pleaseth pleasant fame As nerest kinne to hunger sharpe from whence comes all these same? From desteny the chiefe of all, eche Arte from hence doth flowe, Thence offices deriued all that mortall men doe knowe. In sundry seruants nature ioyes, that diuers things thence may Procede, to deck the world, and letts not all to passe one way, But them comma?deth seuerall course and seuerall paines to take, With sundry sort of workes the world more beautyfull to make. But whether our conditions here are delt by desteny, Or whether of our wyll they spring it semeth good to trye: Nor labour small it doth appere the trouth herein to finde. Of our free wyll what portion doth remaine within our minde? In wretched case we lyue if vs byreft is libertye, If that the chiefe and greatest force of fatall desteny, Constraine vs ill to be, and that by force we in be brought To wickednesse, and if to striue therwith auaileth nought. Wherfore it semeth labour worth our wittes to thys to bende, And for to syft the trouth as much as God shall knowledge sende. Fyrst it behoueth vs to tell what thys free wyll should be, An ample power receiued of God, and largest liberty Deliuered man, that as he lyst, the right, or wayes vniust He folowe should: not (vertue left) that therby sinne he must: But contrary the vices shunde to applye the vertuous wayes: For euill deedes doe harme the soule and good deserueth prayse. Besydes it further must be sought if thys free will doth raine In all a lyke or if it doth in euery time remaine? No sure it semeth not to be in Children, nor in such As vehement anguishe of the minde or body greueth much, Or they whose eyes the heauy sleepes haue shut and closed sure: For slepe is counted plaine of death, the liuely portrature. Wherfore if thou shalt search the truthe with well aduised minde, Thou shalt a smallest sort among so many thousande finde, That with free wil do guide themselues and libertie doe vse. The fault of age I ouerpasse, and childrens yeares excuse, And vnto those that sleeping lye I licence also giue, Or them whom feuers rage doth rost or sycknesse sharpe doth grieue. Of which a number great there be, but greater farre away, And worser eke, whose fylthy minde doth vices foule aray, And fonde affections makes to faint, wythdrawing it with strife From reason farre, and from the path of ryght, and vertuous lyfe. May these be counted for to haue free wyll and libertye? A doubtfull thing it surely is, and many it denye. Wherfore thou well must vnderstande that he alone is free Whom reason rules, &amp; that with payne will neuer conquerd bee, Nor when the stormy tempests rage to rocks is euer thrall, But stoutly sticking to the sterne doth with the hauen fall. So truely earst haue certaine sayde but wisemen none we finde, Whom reason ruling can correct the affections of the minde. The other sort can not doe so: why? hath not God them delt Free wyll? whych euer may be founde where reason may be felt, For these are alwayes coupled styll. So beastes of nature wylde Syth reason they are thought to lack are iudgde from wyll exylde. But all men reason doe receiue, and therfore haue free wyll: For reason is the guide of minde that choseth good from ill, Descerning eke the naughty facts, from such as honest be, And called is the syght, and eye, wherwith the minde doth se. Such eye perhaps as Poliphæm the Poets gaue to thee, Wherwyth the lymmes of thy beloued in seas thou oft didst see, But naught (alas) and all to naught (who, such, to shunne hath might) Vlisses wyth a fiery post hath it bereft of syght, And face, the face that fyrst was fayre, of beauty spoyled quite: Or such an eye as Lynceus had, that sawe in darkest night. Thys eye therefore to euery man Prometheus wysedome delt, But fewe it vse, a very fewe that grace of Ioue haue felt. Hereof the spring of errours doth, and wickednesse aryse. For if the steps of reason, all should treade in nerest wyse, Then peace on earthe shoulde alwayes dwell, and Mars hys bloudy hande Such slaughters nor such cryes shoulde cause, &amp; townes &amp; walles shuld stand, And weapons framed fyrst in hell by fiendyshe furyes wrought, Should tille y? field, with good exchange to share and cultre brought. Then Bees, and Cattel swarming thick and riches of the fielde, Unto the happy husbandman a great increase should yelde. The golden world should then returne, and eke one place containe Both man, &amp; God, who would vouchsafe before our eyes to raine. The cause why fewe doe reason vse, and wayes forbydden knowe, And voide of freewill liue like beastes I wyll assay to showe. A certaine part diuine, in vs that minde and reason hyght, There is, which nature in the head hath placed a loft in syght, And seruants vnto it appoints the senses, that there be, By meanes whereof the Skies &amp; Earth and al things it may see. An other fading force there is wythin the breast enclosde, By meanes wherof we moue, and grow wyth helpe of heate disposde: (Thus hath it pleased God) this straynes molests and grieues the minde, And to this part a number great of seruaunts, is assinde, As fond delight, wrath, griefe, and feare, wyth great desire to gayne, Ambition hauty harmfull thing, wyth fumes that vex the brayne. Wyth these his lusty souldiours he giues battayle to the minde. These mates attempted Ioue to vexe of fiercest giants kinde, As Giges strong, Iapetus, and Tiphœus monstrous sprite Enceladus yll worker, and Briareus dredful wight. Wyth worldly thoughtes hie heapt they vexe, the part diuine aboue, Except that grace from heauen hye like lightning them remoue: As when the raynes are once let lose, the Chariot headlong dryues, And swiftly runnes, to stay the course in vaine the Carter stryues. The fyrst beginnings must be stopped, whyle sparke but kindling lies, When fyre hath rought the lofty partes and flames approch the skies, Especially when Boreas blastes from Northerne Pole doth fall, And rageth fierce, in vayne alas for water then they call. As when from top of hawty rocke, some wayghty stone downe trowles, What force can it of course restrayne? al things wyth it, it rowles, Asunder crackes the mighty trees that on the mountayne springs Which at the fyrst might well be stayed wyth force of smallest things. Euen so the affections of the minde if that wyth all their sway The minde opprest they do inuade, them scarce, can reason stay, And helme and al forsaken quite, wyth streame dame Reason driues, In raging windes, and yeldes to foe a captiue kept in gyues. Therefore while vices yet be yong, let them oppressed be, And voyd the cause ere they waxe strong then minde and wyl is free: Then conquerour thou shalt be crownd wyth Palme of Idumay. But if the assault be now begonne, and siege the foe doth lay, And shakes wyth battrey great y? walles except (beleue me well,) Some God wyth better grace defend, Reason doth byd farewell, And cannot byde so sore a brunt. May we not playnly see What harmes the minde doth there sustayne where Bacchus blessings be, What madnesse ofte doth spring when wine to much in stomack raynes? Tell where free wyl kepes residence when drinke doth vex the braynes? The sober and the fasting man of freewil is possest, And doth what so euer Reason byds: Againe the dronken gest, The thing that he ne would, ne knowes he alwayes doth the same, Which deedes he sobre doth repent, and sorroweth eke wyth shame. So wyth affections minde is dronke, and in none otherwyse, Than wine that topsey turnes the brayn when it doth vpward ryse It troubled is and darkd in mystes. Thus he (and none besides) Hath freedome, and his minde at wyl, whome reason only guides: Who all affections ouercommes, and wholly doth restrayne, He that from youth doth vertue vse, may well to this attaine: Such force hath vse, nothing more str?g. The other sorte are wayde In manner like to brutish beasts, as true the Poet sayd, Eche man his owne delight doth drawe, Freewyll in many opprest And hindred is, wherefore who list Freewyl for to possesse, Let hym resyst while yong they be, thaffections of the minde, And them to reason subiect make, and brydle vse in kinde: For flesh agaynst the sprite rebels, and wyth continuall warres, Doth it molest: The soule most pure, doth couet styll the starres: But lumpish flesh doth shunne the skies, and earthly things desyres, For earth it onely is, and in- to earth at length expyres. Thus two so farre contrary things hath God compact in one. Admit thou art wyse, and onely rulde by reasons force alone, And freewyll perfectly enioyest, shall destnie then beare sway? Yea more to Fates thou subiect arte, and more shalt it obey, For destny is the wyl of God wherewyth the prudent wight Agrees, and doth as it commaundes. The fond and naughty sprite On the other part abhorres his lawes, and shunnes the Lordes decrees. But thou wylt say: then is he free, not rulde by destenies. No: but two worser lordes he serues, and such as vilest be, As wickednesse, and folishnesse his syster in degree. Though this the wyll of God doth cause but that which doth permit, And not the wil that doth commaunde, for of two sortes is it. whereby appeares that al thyngs are subiect to desteny, whether they be of good estate, or of a vile degree: For mischiefe desteny permits and good by force doth send, And God him self c?ma?ds, fr? whome, doth desteny descend. wyth reasons like persuaded some to this effect do say: O mortal men liue ioyfully while that you haue a day, And doleful cares from heart expel, ne trouble once your thought wyth things that present here you see, or after shall be wrought: By fyxed law shall all things fall, and passe by order sure, Wherefore should griefe or foolish feare to sadnesse you procure? Eche man hath here his lot assinde which written secretely, Wythin his breast he alwayes beares, yet nothing knowes thereby, But profe thereof doth come to light vpon the fatall day: When as experience doth reueale that erst in secret lay. what nedeth sobs or wayling teares? for back can neuer runne Celestial sawes, nor nothing chaunge that God hath wrought or done. For order best, and perfect course: if it should altred be It shuld be worse (which may not ch?ce) or better in degree. But nothing of more perfect state than perfect can be found. A doubt both great and maruellous doth spring vpon this ground, For if al things (as late I sayd) are vnder Destenie, why frowneth God on some, and lookes on others graciously? why is not fortune like to al? why seeth some happier dayes Than other do? and nature why seemes she to some alwayes A stepdame sharpe, and vnto some agayne a mother dere? This knot it semeth good that we should breake asunder here. By fault and by desert of vs, a number thinke that this Doth chaunce, and by decree of God such as haue done amysse For to be plagued, and vertuous men good Fortune to receue. But this by no meanes can be true, nor I do it beleue, For what haue brutish beastes deserued, what fault in trees can be? Yet fortune vnto euery beast doth shew diuersity: The theefe doth some conuey, some dye vpon the Butchars knyfe, Some wolues, or sycknesse, frost or flud, some age depriues of lyfe, Some leade their life more pleasantly, and some wyth greater payne. And vnto euery kynde of tree hys fortune doth remaine, The east wynde cracks a sonder thys and rootes doth vpwarde turne, Some sort are cut for diuers things, and some in fiers burne, And lyghtning spoyles an other sort. To euery fishe, and beast, A certaine fortune is assynde by destenies beheast: Yet neyther tree, nor beast can synne. And oftentymes besyde Misfortunes great the good man, doth and vertuous man abyde: On the other part to naughty men doth fortune fauour showe, And graunts them eke in worldly welth and honors hye to flowe. Thus destnye lookes not on desertes: therfore some other way, Or cause, we must attempt to finde. Perhaps some man wyll say The wyll of God is cause of all and seekes none otherwhere: Thys doth not yet suffise, we must go syft the truth more nere: For God synce he is wyse, and best, will not the thing permit That reason lackes, but chiefest things commaunds as seemes most fyt. Wherfore we must say otherwyse: eche cause of causes all As from the fyrst it farther is, so more vnlyke doth fall. Syth God therfore is alwayes pure, and euer one shal be, The last of causes that from him is farthest in degre Shall double be, and diuers seeme, and worke shall alwayes frame In sundry sortes, and altring state and this is euen the same That rules the earth, and euery thing that earth doth here containe Therfore nothing on earth is seene that certaine is or plaine. Syth fortune hir vnstedfast wheele doth turne in sundry sort: And mortall men wyth diuers chaunce to guide, hath chiefest sport. But yet why smyles she so on some, and frownes on other sort? Why giues she some a lyfe wyth cares, and some a princely port? The cause of this is harde to knowe as if we would require, To know the cause of raging heate we feele in flaming fyre: Or wherfore worwood bitter is, why snowe doth shewe so white, wherfore some herbs haue force to hurt, and others healing might, And why some trees beare s?dry branch why in such shape they growe, Or why some beasts haue subtile sense, and some are dull and slowe, Wherfore y? strawes doth Amber draw, why Loadstone lyfteth hye The yron peece, why it can not doe so the Diamonde nye. Such things hath God in secrete shut, and vnto mortall braine. Appointed boundes, the which to passe mans wyt doth striue in vaine, As if the potter doe deuide in sundry partes his clay, And it departed thus abrode, to sundry purpose lay, Why rather he of thys than that a pot or dishe doth bake: Or bason broade? Of thys a Crock, of that a pytcher make? Doth reason moue him thus to doe? or reason none at all But only wyll? as he thinks best so frames he great and small. Tys harde to know y? workmans mind: Euen so, who seekes to knowe Why fortune some exalteth hye, and bringeth others lowe: A thing to hye he reacheth at, for God hath giuen powre Of earth to hir, and of the world hath made hir gouernour, That what she lyst shee may perfourme the force of desteny Excepted still, for euery thing is gouerned therby. why should not she doe what she lyst? what law should hir restraine? Ought seruants lawes for to appoint their Lordes for to constraine? we all hir seruants truely are whyle we enioy this lyght, And must in euery thing obey the pleasure of the spright, Yet of our soules she hath no powre whose roote in heauen standes, Thys onely God exempted hath from out thys tyrants handes. All other things in earth or seas, as she shall best deuise God suffers frely to be done, both good and ill likewyse. But some wyll say: God then is cause of euery euill act, And so vniust may well be calde, for he that doth the fact, And he that suffers it to passe, doe both one fault commit, And both lyke punnishement to haue the law adiudgeth fit. Wherefore if God such illes on earth doth suffer for to raine, And when he well may them forbydde, yet doth not them restraine: He shall be thought the cause of ill, and mischiefe to embrace: Thys part I also aunswere shall if God doe graunt me grace. First therfore with attentiue minde it must be noted well, That causes some be base, and small, and some againe excell In worthinesse before the rest: as in a battayle mayne Lieuetenants are, and Captaines stout, the rest of common traine. These causes chiefe aboue the rest in wondrous sort assignes Thalmighty Lord, that guides aboue the Starres, the starry sygnes, Who lyues in euerlasting lyght aboue the Heauens hye, That at hys beck doth cause to turne the motions of the skye: To euery cause assigning force, and whereto they shall tende, With certaine boundes encloseth them the which may none transcende. And synce he wysely all things made, of force it followe must, That euery thyng continuallye keepe course and order iust. For things that once are rightly framed and fault doe none receaue, Ought not in tract of any times their wonted course to leaue, The order thus of euery thing can neuer altred be, Bicause thalmighty Lorde hath made all things in iuste degre. If then the sprite that guides the earth be naught, or worke amisse, It is bicause the basest cause and farthest of is this From causer fyrst, and lyght remoued a large and ample space. And therefore vnto darknesse blynde, the nerer hath hys place, And onely shadowe shewes of truth: which God doth so permit Bicause the state of all the world and order asketh it. For as the daye determinde is by darknesse of the night, And things contrary ended are by force of others might: So sort and course of causes good as reason doth require In vyle and wicked cause must ende and fynally expyre: which wycked kingdomes gouerne shal, and mischiefes vile shall guide, Hence discorde euermore proceedes wyth brawles, and minde to chide, Strong battailes, frayes, &amp; false disceyt with fyres, and slaughters great, Theftes, wyles, with nede &amp; robberies, and plagues, with raging heate, Great earthquakes, stormes, &amp; tempests great, of sycknesses such store, So great a sort of perilles vile, and daungers euermore, And finally what harmes to hap in any place we knowe From thys so wretched cause &amp; Prince of all the earth doth flowe. Full truely earst (alas) did say the famous Hermes wyse This world a heape of harms doth seme where euery mischiefe lyes. Bicause the diuell that on earth the chiefest stroke doth smite Is mischieuous, and euermore in cruelty doth delight. For as the first of causes is the spring of all good things, So is the last the fountayne chiefe from whence all mischiefe springs. Wherefore if lecherours on earth beare al the rule and sway, If Asses syt in seate as Kings, in pompe of proud aray, If charge of sheepe commytted is to wolues of rauening kinde, If Harlots in the Churches dwel and men of monstrous minde, If that the holy rytes of Christ the hands vnpure doth fyle, If Heauen and purging place Sir Iohn doth sell wyth greedy guile, More, if vnpunnished such crimes are styll before our eyes, The fault not in thalmighty Lord but in this Diuell lies: whome fortune commonly we name, and Pluto oft we call, But vnto him an apter name Sarcotheus fyt doth fall: For vnto him the power of flesh and guiding is assinde, Him serues all such as loue them selues, so much wyth fleshly minde: Of him the bodies are, therefore in synne they alwayes driue, And to the soules as enimies contrary styl do stryue. For of the heauens commes the soule, and from the starry Skyes, But earthly are the bodies here and heauens do despyse. This same Sarcotheus thoe that guydes the lowest partes of all, Such holy men as do despise the ioyes terrestriall, To vertue bent, and Godly life, he hates and styl pursues: And vexeth, grieueth, &amp; them molests: as commonly doth vse The naughty Prince, and cruel King, alwayes for to oppresse The wysest men, and such as do excell in vertuousnesse. For vertue of the wicked men is euermore enuied. Al things their enimies hate and feare and shunne from them asyde. Therefore the Diuel many harmes prouideth for the meeke, And them whose mindes do mo?t aloft, and hearts do heauen seke. Ne would he haue his malice seene, for if he should be knowne, Al men would him detest, as head from whom at ylles haue flowne, And bloudy butcher of our kinde, him al should iustly hate, And cursing cal him cruel beast deceyuer of our state. Therefore he craftely lies hydde, and from the wyse man flies, Least he be knowne, ne feares he Moles but leapes from Linceus eyes. So theues do vse, and wicked men alwayes the light to flye, And in the darkest tyme reioyce that none their mischiefe spye. Hereof it commes as often as men feele aduersity, Al ignorant wyth blindnesse, and of minde oppressed be, (For ignorance is causer chiefe of errors al that fal) Thinking with anger and complaynt, the guyde of goodnesse al Doth vex th?, so they straightway curse his hie and holy name. The wicked Diuel daunceth then, and grinneth at the same, And ioyes to see himself vnknowne, and mischiefe close to lye, And that he thus hath power to hurt and no man could it spye. A foe vnto thalmighty God he is, and ennimy, By whome from heauen tumbled down in chaynes he here doth lye, Enclosde betwene the earth and Mone and there he holdes his rayne. Wherfore O wretched mortal men at length apply your brayne, To know the cause of al your griefes, from whence such ylles do flowe, And heauy harmful things do hap, your butcher learne to know: For this Sarcotheus this is he that plagues you in such sorte, That of your harmes &amp; greuous grefes doth make his chiefest sport: None otherwise than Mars his child (great realmes in thraldome brought) Wyth death of wretched men or beastes a pleasant pastyme sought. The Noble men the Gentlemen, the commons all syt styll, In diuers roomes assigned them, as Othæs lawes doth wyll: Then enters in before them all the cutters for to fyght, Or else some other yeldes hys lymmes to beastes thereon to byte: The Lion, or the Tiger stout, or else some fiercer kinde, Should at this play present himselfe to please the peoples minde: Wyth death &amp; mangled much w? wound from whence the bloud doth flow, Oft vnto some of others smart a great delight doth grow. Wherefore they do most wickedly, that rayling thus do brawle, And dare blaspheme thalmighty Lorde, the cause of goodnesse all: From whome as from himself, no yll can any tyme proceede, Except contingently as Sunne doth darcknesse euer breede As oft as vnder earth it slydes, and absent fyre we see Encreaseth colde: yet cloud in Sunne, nor colde in Fyre can be. Wherfore I maruel much that some whose Learning is not smal, Do say that he offended is, or wrathful him do cal, And that he plagueth vs as oft as we do him offend, That milde, and Lord of mercies is, that goodnesse al doth send: And that from him doth warres begin, wyth plague and famine sore. If that our deedes could him offend. what thing vnhappier more Than he, in al the world were found? for euery day and houre We crimes commit, and blasphemies out of our mouthes we poure: Then surely should he neuer ioy, nor rest in quietnesse, Nor God should happy be, if that as oft as we transgresse He should be wroth, &amp; moued with dedes of such as synfull be. But God can not be vext or harmd if we the truth wyl se: For of such might and perfectnesse, of God the nature is, And distant euen so farre is it from our iniquities, That we from him do differ more and farder are by much, Than is from vs the Asse, the Flye, the Flea, or worse than such. How then can we such wretches vile offend a Lord so great? Or by what meanes may we him harm and force him thus to freat? Is not this God of passions voyd, and free from griefe or payne: And thereby liues in blessed state and alwayes doth remayne? Doth it becom a Prince to fume when foles do fondly prate: Or rather them for to contemne? seemes it a giants state, Wyth little children for to fight? since he knowes al things wel And doth the things to come foresee, I thee besech to tel, Ought he such things for to create, as should his pleasure spot, Wherby he should be after grieued? or rather ought he not That helpes the world, to help himself? or tel if thus diseased He willes it so, if he wyll so he is no whit dyspleased, But rather ioyes. If he would not why doth he it permit? Or is he not omnipotent? he is, we al graunt it. Then ought he not to suffer it but yet he doth we see, Whereby no kinde of griefe he feeles, as reason teacheth me: But leades his life in quietnesse. Here thou perchaunce wylt say If that our synnes him not displease, wyth al the force we may Let vs runne headlong into vice and neuer sinne forbeare, Not so: but to these words of mine giue thou attentiue eare, And vnto thee of truth strayghtwayes the gates I shall disclose. When any man doth synne, then forth away he flinging goes From this same spring of good, &amp; leaues both right, and light and peace: Wherby the synner euermore hys harmes doth still encrease. Such is the state of contraryes that how much thou doest flye, From one, vnto the other straight thou doest approche more nye. So he that synning flyes from God, runnes to Sarcotheus next: Whose yoke when he hath once put on with griefes he sore is vext: And as the tyraunt doth commaunde is plagued in sundry wyse. Thus no man synnes but punnishment for hym prepared lyes, Yet God is neuer cause of ill as I haue sayde before As of hymselfe and properly: But he that synnes therfore, doth with his owne consent, Unto the hangman giue himselfe: to haue his punnishment But hereof springs two crabbed doubts, for if that synne be cause Of al our mischiefe and our ylles, and our vnhappy sawes, Why often doth the wicked man his lyfe in pleasure trayne And dyeth wel, the vertuous man doth many griefes sustayne, And endes at length in misery? Besydes before is taught, That by no fault nor our deserts, things good do chaunce, or naught: But rather seemes it from the power of certayne sprite to flowe, Who guides the Seas, and al the earth, and ayre possesseth lowe. How speake I thus in contraries? my wordes do disagree, But (reader) wel thou shalt discerne the trouth and verify, And darknesse from thy mynd thou shalt behold farre of to flye, If these my words thou wilt vouchsafe to heare attentiuely. Know therefore double good to be, one as the Commons wil, The other as the wisemen iudge. So of two sortes is ill, The opinion of the common sort is worser euermore: For grosse, and doltishe is their braine of iudgement lacking store: wherfore the goods of body here and such as fortune gaue These onely they doe wonder at and these they seeke to haue: But now the goods that in the minde are founde for to remaine They either know not what they meane or else they count them vaine. The wyse man on the other syde the onely goods of minde Doth seeke to haue, and doth despyse the rest and other kinde. Thus followed we before the minde of rude and common men, And as such people vse to speake so was my talke as then. But from the rude and common sort, my minde doth differ now: As wyse men iudge of good and ill at thys time I allowe. And in such sort I say no good vnto the wicked man May chaunce, and to the vertuous sort no euill happen can: Which plainely will I now declare and clerely shall appere. Fyrst thys it nedefull is to knowe, what vice or cryme is here, Is of the minde a sicknesse sore: nor men are onely syck In body here, but minde aye feeles hir wounde and greuous prick No lesse in force, than body doth. Thus euery euill wight Is syck, bicause hys will is syck, and iudgement is not right. Whereby the wretch y? harmeful things more worth than good esteemes, And sweter aye the filthyest factes to hym than honest semes, Which if hys minde &amp; wyll were sounde coulde neuer wicked be: But iust and vertuous should be found: in thys they disagree. And as the body all is ill when any of these twayne Diseased is with maladie, the heart, or else the braine: So, so, alas the whole estate of soule is euer ill, Wh? as these two with vice are harmde the minde and eke the wyll. As pleasaunt meate to stomack syck doth seme vnpleasaunt aye And profytes nothing vnto hym that sycknesse doth assay: So (sycke the soule) no good thing can the wicked man come by, Nor nothing profytes him at all, which true I thus wyll trye. Some men in lawes expert we see, but full of subtiltie, And couetous, vniust, and one that wayes not honesty What profites hym hys learning here? what good gaines he therfore? Alas he wretches doth beguile, and spoyles hys Clyents poore, And many other doth he hurt. Learning vnto the naught Is lyke a sworde vnto the man that mad hath it vp caught. For all things doth the wycked man abuse, and make vnpure, To others harme, shame to himselfe, and hatred doth procure, And in his feete the thornes he set with anguishe often goes Or else he feareth them, wyth hurt whom he hath made hys foes. Shall then hys learning good be calde which doth so many blame, And hurt like stinging snake, ne spares the owner of the same? And so of other faculties that yll men occupie. Estemed them to be as good lyke reason doth denie. But now the wycked man is riche wyth Golde and Iewels store, Are not these riches good? not so, tell me the cause wherefore. Lo here I tell, bicause he doth abuse them filthily, He kepeth hores, and surfetteth, and baudes therewith doth by, With money gredy boyes corrupts, and wyth great gyftes assayes The chastitie of maidens poore that happen in hys wayes, And so that he may bring to passe what lust doth hym persuade Regardes no whit what lawes of men or Gods precepts doe trade: Who if he once be couetous what crime dare he not doe? Thys wolfe w? bloudy mouth doth rage eche folde to come vnto, And runneth headlong into vice hys mischiefe to contriue, And euery where he followeth harde as vyle desyre doth driue. Nothing may worse be suffered than fooles in welthy state, Than riche men to be couetous than ill men fortunate. Thus eyther lyke to beastes he doth with fleshely pleasures go, Unto himselfe an ennimye and to hys purse a foe: Or else all other Tantalus hys goods to much doth spare, And heapes vp all, ne knowes for whom these heapes he doth prepare. And as the swine to his owne vse, himselfe he doth not feede But many mo, who fruites of toyle doe snatche away with speede. Wherby appeares no goods to be the riches of the yl, But if he stoute and sturdy be and stomacke haue as wyll What doth he th?? he straight wil braul, and with hys mighty powre Now one, now others shall he harme, and mischiefe euery howre: Most commonly a warfare goes, or else becomes a chiefe, That Tygarlyke by others bloud he may receiue reliefe: Both warres &amp; weapons fierce he loues for mischiefe not for prayse, whereby he to his countrey gettes both losse and shame alwayes. Stout personage void of vertuous mind puts many men to paine, Lastes lyttle time, and seldome doth to aged yeares attaine. But what nedes many wordes herein syth these examples may Suffise the trouth therof to shewe, and clerely to display. Now meete it is wyth good aduise to searche if ought can be That harmes the iust and holy men, as many iudge we se: Sure harde it is, yet boldely will I thereto trudge apace Presuming of Apolloes helpe, and of my Muses grace. Fyrst euery good man nedes must be of soule and minde both sounde, Though sycknesse in hys body rage or ache in limmes be founde: Least will, and iudgement ryght in him doe lacke or not agre, For voide of iudgement, right, &amp; wyll, no vertuous man may be: These two are the foundations wheron doth vertue syt. Such men whatsoeuer they possesse doe iustly order it: And therfore is their learning good, their substance and their strength, And finally whatsoeuer they possesse, and haue at length. For in the greatest sort of things the vse of them we se Is it that chiefly causeth them both good, and ill to be. And if so be thimmortall Gods of men haue any care, They chiefely ought such to defende as iust and vertuous are: Which if they should not doe they semde all voide of reason cleare, Unworthy eke of odour sweete, of Church or seruice here. Wherfore I doe not se what thing can harme the vertuous man, Ne yet what ill in body, or in minde, he suffer can: Syth God him kepes and norisheth, and with his mighty arme Doth for him fight, and sets him safe from euery kinde of harme. For who helpes not, or who doth not defende his frende at neede, whensoeuer he can, if that he doe beare him good wyl in deede? But yet sometimes the good man semes to liue in misery, To suffer nede, and sicknesses, and great aduersity: When as in deede he is not good, but playes the Hipocrite: Wherof a number shalt thou finde that vnder simple plight, Do secret hide their poysoned heartes and woluish natures playne, And foolish men do oft beguile, while they do vertue fayne: And therfore god who knowes y? hearts and secrets of the minde, Preserues him not, nor loueth him. But we wyth iudgement blinde, And doltish head, deceyued wyth sygne and shaddow of the right, Think then the iust man suffers hurte, and liues in woful plight. Alas how often false and fond, are founde the iudgements blynde Of men, and eke how ignorant of truth is mortal minde: Al please themselues, and euery man in his conceyt seemes wise: By this we cause the Goddes to laugh, hence errors most do rise, But here admit the iust man feeles both griefe and sicknesses, And leades his life in pouerty, and aye in great distresse, Exiled from his countrey farre, or pent in pryson vile, Or vext wyth other casualties, doth he take harme this while? No: for in suffring of such things more clerely shine he shall: Al to the best to Godly men as God commaundes doth fall. And as Physitians vse to giue the byttrest medcines oft Unto the sicke to bring them health, and rayse them vp aloft: So oftentymes God tries the iust, to stirre them vp thereby, That so he may them more compel their vertue to apply. As pleasure makes men foles, &amp; naught so payne doth cal to minde, And chaseth vice, a bytte to synne, a spurre to vertues kinde. Seest thou not golde in fyry flame more precious to be made? And ground more fertile for to be by edge of churlish spade? And standing waters to corrupt? On yron cast thine eye Is fayrer made by occupyings, and rusts if it do lye. Thus diuers things there are that vext, receyue a clearer state, As chiefly vertue, that when as hir blackest mischiefes mate Appeares most bright, as in the darke the fyre more fayrer shewes. wherfore no kinde of griefe at al, the good man euer knowes: Or if he suffers ought his pa- cience gets him greater gayne, And medcine though it bitter be, doth cause release of payne: And least some man should think that I do tryfles fayne in minde: The thing that holesome others feele is poyson to some kinde. So vnto some, wines hurtful are, and flesh a harmfull meate, So wormwood vnto many health doth gyue, and pleasure greate. So heare doth Snow, and wax, and Ise consume and melt away: which heat doth harder make agayne the earth or potters clay. So many such in sundry states, do worke in diuers kinde. How eft the same wordes some delight that vex anothers minde? Al things to al sortes are not lyke: the wines that best we deeme, If they in musty caske be kept both tart and naught do seeme. Unto the sound are al things sound, but such as sycknesse haue, Them holesome meates doe sometyme harme, and almost bring to graue. So (to my matter to returne) the ylles of body than, Or stings of fortune hurtful be vnto the euylman: But good and also necessary for such as vertuous be, By which although they hurtful seeme, they gayne more hye degree. These words for this tyme shal suffise, for now this booke to ende My Muse commaundes, &amp; Chiron doth vpon my Pen attende, Who coueteth of state of man to write, and fashions rife, And open to disclose abrode the vestry here of lyfe. Now therfore nedeful is for me my Muses tunes to ceasse, And silent in the sacred woods to rest my selfe in peace, And on the roofe of learnings lodge on hye to hange my harpe: Tyll that these tymes be ouerpast and doleful seasons sharpe, Tymes much to be bewaylde: wherein the discorde that doth broyle Among the states, all Italy wyth warres doth seke to spoyle, Whereby doth Rome lament hir case, hir housholdes layd on ground, Ticinum, Narniæ, Melphis eke this fall haue felt and found. And Naples that wyth Mermaydes tomb so famous lately ioyed Beholding now hir orchards fayre wyth French mens hands destroied. Alas doth heauy mourne by streames, of Sebethes so cleare. What should I tel the w?drous flames that in the skyes appeare, More bright than dayes &amp; locusts grim, like cloudes the Sunne to hide, And tender corne with gredy iawes, to spoyle on euery syde? How many cities woful plague, and piteous famine sore, Hath quite depriued of Citizens? how many places more, Wyth flouds are almost perished? Alas how iustly now doth God plague vs in sundry case? What mischief do we not commyt, what iustice is in place, What loue or seruice here of God? Religion now is made An occupation for the purse, a Marchandise and trade. The sacred rytes are aye defyled, wyth hands of baudy mates. Yet loke theron and let it passe, the Kings and Princely states, And honour due to Christ aboue they not esteeme nor way. Thus ouer vs pore misers here, such blockes do beare the sway, Therefore I wyl go hence a while, and in Parnasus hyll Until my Muse doth cal me forth, lye close and secrete styll. Sagittarius, the ninth Booke. It waxeth light now Muse enough wythin Castalian lake, We rested haue, the wrest therfore and Harp in hand go take: Set strings in tune, and with thy grace accustomed to thy kinde, Sing Goddesse auncient melody: good verses fyl thy minde That erst Apollo wonted was in Bay tree woods to tel: While he by riuer stoode that runnes from out Permessus Wel. Us calles behold another toyle wherein some prayse doth lye, Let vs from hautye place and top, of Parnas hylles so hye Beholde the sundry mindes of men, and eke their liuing marke. Nowe past the middest of surging seas had runne my sayling barke, And now the toppes of lofty trees wyth frosty ryndes were white: When as a certaine God vnknowne by me stoode vp in syght, And shining wyth his beames deuine expellde the blackishe night. A certaine rock I then behelde whose top did reache so hye, That passing cloudes aboue it might discouer plaine the skye: Harde semed it first to enter vp, for ragged stones there was Placed round about, which made y? way both straight, and ill to passe, The bottom all beset wyth bryers: the mydst more mylde againe, And nerer as it comes to skyes the path appeares more playne, And easyer to be trauailed, Theorea eke it hyght Hereto me straightwayes did conduct my Ghost and guiding spright. To top wherof when as we came I myght beholde and see, Eche place with w?drous syghts fulfild and furnished to bee, Which if my tong would here declare the Sunne should soner slyde To lowest partes, and night the earth with misty cloke should hyde. Whyle as I stay, and gase vpon the large and ioyfull syghtes: Lo fallyng from the skyes aloft a voice these wordes recytes: Stellatus bowe thy knees, and here thy humble prayers make Unto the Almighty king, without whose grace thou canst not take The pleasant pleasures of this mount. Therefore in humble wyse Kneele thou to God, for fauour all doth fall to earth from skyes: For nothing is wherof to man can greater profyte flowe, Than heauenly helpe with holy prayers to get, and God to knowe. When thys I hearde, vpon the earth my face, and hande vpright, I bowed my knees, and poured out these words in harty plight. O Father great of saints, chiefe powre that in the worlde may be, Than whom may neuer thing be found, nor thought of more degree, Remoued farre from body here, yet framing fashyons all, Both such as neuer fade, and such as times at length lettes fall: The first, and of beginning voide, the fountaine whence doth spring All kinde of good, of nature eke the auctor, guide, and king: That all things here dost comprehende, comprended thou of none, The hye Almighty Maiesty, and chiefest good alone, Lyfe, wysedome, order, praise, and ende, minde, truth, way, lyght, and grace, No where thy selfe inhabiting, and dwelling in eche place, Unmoueable, and mouing giuest to all and euery thing, From whom, in whom, &amp; eke by whome all kynde of things do spring: In one estate remaining styll, and changing in no time, The chiefest cause that rowling aye the Globe where starres doe shine, Doest guide by fixed law thappoin- ted force of destenye: Of Lordes the greatest Lorde of all, and King of Kings most hye, Before whose face a thousande boastes of Angels glystering bright, Doe minister with ioyfull hymnes in presence of thy syght, Amidst the ample fieldes of lyght aboue the worlde so hye Where aptest place and seate there is for things of certaintye. I worship thee, I honor thee, and prostrate here on face I lyft mine eyes desyring thee wyth mylde and cherefull grace, Upon me synfull man to looke, and heare my earnest crye, Poure downe into my earthly brest thy beames of lyght from hye, Driue darkenesse fr? my minde opprest alas in dolefull wyse, Whyle in consuming carcasse here and fading fleshe it lyes. Graunt me the perfect path to finde least harmefull errors sting wyth fansy fonde, and iudgement blind, in synne me headlong fling. For without thee, the wit of man, and force of mortall kinde, while it intendes to mount a loft receiues a greater fall: As Icarus whose wyngs him faylde when he flewe hyest of all. Graunt therfore O most mighty king to mee thy creature lowe, Thy will to learne, and thee to please, and then that I may knowe Mine own estate, from whence I came, and wherto I was made, And whether I at length shall passe when that from hence I fade: what here in lyfe I should perfourme, and what I should not doe: That when dame Lachesis my threde of lyfe hath snapt in two, And that the farthest day is come that long with priuie stelth Procurde my graue death bring my rest and part of sauing helth. These words thus sayde, an other voice againe did pearce my eares, Thalmighty Lorde thou pleased hast thy prayer full well he heares: Pluck vp Stellatus now thy heart to thee for to remaine Here on this mount it graunted is and sacred fruites to gaine. Thys said forthwith the voice did ceasse, nor worde it vttered more: Then in my minde a greater force I felt, than earst afore, And sharper syght: then looked I forth all things descerning well And for my eyes, they myght presume olde Linceus to excell. With that I felt a subtill wynde to lyft me vp on hye, which softly causde me to ascende to toppe of starry skye: Much lyke the byrde that beares y? darts that Vulcans forge dyd frame, That when we synne, y? thunder thomps doe fling and flashe oft flame. And nowe approcht I nere the Moone whose gates I had in syght, Wherof, part glistred all with golde, and part with syluer white. I entre in beholding al, when straight with me doth meete Timalphes yong, of vertues great, and eke of fauoure sweete: (Whom of Arete Ioue begat in auncient tymes of olde.) He knewe me straight, for oft he had hys mothers hestes me tolde, And when eche other greted was he much things asked of me: And after brought me to a towne of hugest quantitie, The loftye walles of Diamonde strong were raysed hye and framde, The bulwarks built of Carbuncle, that all as fiery flamde. O Lorde what gorgeous houses there, and goodly syghtes I saw, As Temples fayre, and Theaters, and streetes, and seates of lawe: Al framed of syluer, gold and stone, and more of goodly kinde I there beheld, but cannot now beare al away in minde: And though I could remembre al yet God doth not allowe, That c?mon peoples heads shuld know the state of all, and how. I wondred at the number great that through the city so Al clad in white by thousands thick amyd the streates to go, Their heads beset wyth garlands fayre in hand the Lillies white, They ioyful beare Menarchus guyde of Cynthyus kingdome bright: Remembring oft w? Himnes they syng, and swete agreing layes, Menarchus name they oft rehearse, Menarch wyth Psalme they prayse: Menarchus name did Eccho lowde resounding oft send out, He vanquished in happy fielde th' Arcadian giants stout: As then Timalphes tolde to me wyth wordes that were not vayne. Once was (quoth he) Arcadia voyd of hylles, and al lay playne, There dreadful giants Kingdome held, as Mænalos the hye, And Pholoe, and Lyceus great that ioyed in woods to lye: And Erymanth whose shoulders bare the backes of sauage swine, Cyllenes eke that boylde wyth spyte, agaynst the powers diuine: Who fyrst before the rest presu- ming al of force and might, Durst giue ill language to the Moone wyth wordes of canckred spite, That they before hir long were borne, and of more noble race, And so that they deserue the names of Gods, and higher place. Besydes in rage a towre they built amyd the skies to looke: O Nemroth larger farre than thine, and wyth an yron hooke, Attempted thrice from place to pluck this Goddesse where she standes, Bloud red for feare to see hir selfe so nere to wretches hands: Menarchus gaue them thrice repulse wyth valeant force and might, And thrice the iuice out prest from gras of olde Saturnus spright: Among them cast the poyson runnes straightwayes through al their bones Wyth chylling colde, consumed w? payn they leaue their liues at once: And vggly soules they cleane forsake, which hel below receaues, Wher as with paynes they plagued are that neuer after leaues. But now their bodies quite destroyde by force of venome late, Their carcasse turnde to lofty hilles kepes name wyth chaunged state. Whereby this deede and triumph great in minde the Moone men beare, And celebrate wyth solemne pompe this feast from yeare to yeare, And to their king they worship make with great and ioyful cheare. Thus passing forth, we found a tower that all of Gold did shine, Al wrought, &amp; set wyth precious stones of sundry colours fine: Here quoth my guyde, no mortal man may euer set his feete: We stayde therfore, and by the space of large and ample streete, On euery syde we might beholde approching soules at hand, And there before the seate and place of iudgement for to stand: Which placed was agaynst the towre, and wrought right cunningly, Three sonnes of Ioue and fayth begot syt there in seates ful hye, To iudge the soules, regarding wel of al their sinnes the store, And vertuous deedes that euery man hath done in earth before. Telescopus and Dorophon Philorthus frend alway To iustice, these, desertes and faultes in perfect balance way: And by their iudgements very fewe to heauen did ascend: But thousands of the same agayne to earth did downe descend, And many also in the Moome they did commaund to stay. Astonished long wyth gasyng syght at length I gan to say: Declare to me good guyde quoth I, if Hell beneath doth lye In deepest dongeon of the earth, and to the Center nye, And soules thereto conueyde they say the corse clapt vnder hearce, Olde Aeacus and Minos there and Radamanthus fearce Do euer iudge, and giue rewardes or else deserued payne, How chaunceth it I here beholde the like thing done agayne? Mannes mind (quoth he) in pryson dark of carcasse shut doth lye: And forced by fault and ignorance, is led by wayes awry. By this is man to dreames and toyes of nature prone and bent, And from the truth he wanders farre, if grace do not preuent. No maruel thoe, if many things your Poets false haue song: Bycause to treade the steppes of truth lies not in euery tong. But thou, haue alwayes well in minde these mysteries I tell: All things are good and neuer fade aboue the Moone that dwell, Nor griefe can vexe those sacred states: But all that nature framed beneath the Moone, is nought, and ill, And lawe seuere of death doth feele, and force of time to spyll. These places doth the middle spheare of Moone in twaine deuide, Placde equally betwixt the worlde doth boundes to heauen bide. Thus when that lyfe is fledde, all soules are brought vnto thys place, And here pleade gilty or vngilty before the iudges face: By whose awarde, to certaine roomes, according to their deedes They straight are sent, receiuing there for their desertes their meedes. And euery one the heuyer they with heapes of vice are made, The deeper they descende the pyt of darke infernall shade. Agayne the better that they be and farther of from crime, So much they higher mounting vp, more nye the heauens clime. But they whose ylles do counterpease the vertues of their minde, For to remaine about the Moone, are many yeares assinde: Tyl eyther falling fresh to vice, when many yeares are spent, They turne to earth, or purged wel, are into heauen sent. Loe thus he sayd. But then agayne what is the cause quoth I, That soules so fewe the starres approch and gayne the heauens hie? Why runne they hedlong so to vice, and (Misers) vertue flye, Why more esteme they dark than light and rather synne to apply Than vertue pure? where of to them doth so great madnesse rise? What will so fond doth them beguile, what fansy bleares their eyes? Then aunswered thus Aretes sonne: both I do it desire, And mete it is, that I disclose the things thou dost require, And many other things besyde, which thou thy selfe shalt say, Are worthy to be learned here and to be borne away, Since here wythout the power of God I know thou canst not come, Who list such things to thee to shewe: before the gates of whome No man aliue may once approch, except by him assinde, Then now giue eare, and what I say, beare wel away in minde. But nedeful fyrst it is for vs a little hence to walke. We went, and in a lofty tower we both syt downe to talke, From whence both seas &amp; land ful plain we might beholde and see. Then thus from sacred brest, this voice he vttred out to me: As of them selues the soules can not be yll, nor bent to synne, Since y? their kinde doth come fr? skyes and spring from God begynne: Nor of theyr owne and proper wyll, their natures can be nought, Since God them made who neuer thing of euill state hath wrought. But many other causes be that into dongeon vile Of hel do downwards thrust these souls and them with vice defile. And chiefe of them the body is, wherein the soule lyes bounde As in a pryson strong, whose bondes doth iudgement quite confounde: No otherwyse than fyre is hydde wythin an earthen pot, And misty cloudes doe darke the syght of flaming Phebus hot. Then all things doth the soule forget, And Lethes streames doth taste, And lyke apperes to papers blankt, wherein no worde is placde. Thus captiue closed in fading fleshe, a thousande mischiefes ill, A thousande Monsters hir assault, and alwayes seeke to spill, Lyke as the Goldefinch whyle in cage, hir dolefull desteny wyth sundry sortes of pleasaunt tune doth seeke to pacify: To whom all close and couertly the crafty Cat comes neare, And driues molesting sore the wretche on euery syde to feare. The Cat a bane to symple byrdes, of Myce the finder out, She fearing sore the spoylers pawe, doth flutter rounde about The Cage, and saues hir selfe by flight: when present doth appeare An other foe with furye lyke the selly wretche to feare, Who thrusting in hir Tallons sharpe, doth take hir cleane away, And feedes thereon with wonted noyse as on accustomed pray. So here and there with diuers foes th' vnhappy soule is tost, And flying farre the ginnes of some is in the others lost; While inclosde in carcasse here it liues It knowes not what to do, What daunger here for to beware, or what to cleaue vnto. And with the showe of good deceiued, much like the dronken wyght It stackring standes. Whereby, if that by some that teache aryght, Or by their ayde that warning giue, it be not ledde or brought From darkenes blinde vnto the lyght, it runneth styll to nought, And better things doth aye refuse. of soule the chiefest staye: Contagion fyrst, and chiefest ill, that through the fleshe doth rayne, Is ignoraunce of truth and good, from whence out springeth than, False iudgement as the greatest plague that happens vnto man. Wherof two monsters are begot, folly, and wickednesse, From these two euery ill proceedes that man can here expresse. For all men sinne, eyther bicause the goodes here counterfeat They most esteeme as folly leades, or else that mischiefe great Doth prick them forth to wicked deedes. Wherfore, we iustly may Count him a foole, or wicked man, that doth from reason stray. But in that part of soule that lustes, there syttes dame follyes grace, And there she pytched hath hir tents, and chose hir dwelling place: In the other part all bent to wrathe, there mischiefe hath his holde, With force, and Craft, &amp; poyson strong most dreadfull to be tolde. These two (for truth) are mighty kings, and armyes great behinde They leade, and both destroy the state of mortall kinde. They both are ygnorant of truth, and framed false iudgement by, (As earst was tolde) the soules that in the carcasse buryed lye Unmindefull of their owne estate, and voide of light withall, Into three lakes of Hell, and death, they leade, and downe let fall. Of which the first Limosum hight, therein doth pleasure rayne, Spinosum is the other calde, where vile desyre to gaine, And couetousnes, doth rule: the thyrde Fulmosum hath to name, where pride beares sway, y? thristeth still for honours hye and fame. In these three lakes the greatest part doe perishe euery daye: Of all the soules within the worlde this is the chiefe decay. For such as slyde into these pooles. them euermore distroyes The lust of fleshe, and gredy minde, of fonde and fading ioyes. Ne of themselues they knowledge haue, nor of the heauens bright, Nor other lyfe they thinke to be than this in present syght. O fylthy, fonde, and doltishe mindes from heauen turned quite, Not minding hye or worthy things but still in brutishe plite, Respecting only here the earth. Besydes are causes mo, Wherby the soules infected are, and often plaged so. For where the clouds are thronged thick and showres of raine proceede, And windes w? dreadful meeting sounde doe flashe of lightnings breede, There is the place of vglye sprites, by whom doe plagues aryse, With battailes fierce &amp; raging stormes, through seas, and lande that flyes. By craft and by the tempting force of them, and their deceit, The symple sort of men doe fall to euery mischiefe great: Hereby both right and honesty, they quite cast from their minde. But now, bicause these temptours here, and fiendes of deuilishe kinde, Fewe can obtaine wyth eyes to se, therfore but fewe beleue That any such things doe remaine, nor credit wyll they geue: Nay rather many doe account it but an ydle fame, And as at dreames of folkes diseased, so laugh they at the same. But thou driue from thy minde away thys foolishe heresy, And giue good credite to my wordes of greatest certainty. And for bicause thou shalt perceiue I teache not trifles vaine, I wyll procure that thou shalt see all thyngs before thee plaine. But fyrst it needefull is wyth prayers Dame Rainebowe for to trye, Who wonted was to beare the hestes of Iuno through the skye: That she with winde disperse y? cloudes, and make the skyes looke fayre, Least that thy syght be hyndered, by dymnesse of the ayre. Then humbly in thys wyse I praide: O thou Thaumatis hye, Of sundry colour to beholde a beauty to the skye, That stretchest forth in misty cloudes, thy great and myghty bowe, And Phebus shining bright his beames in thee doest beare and showe, And flouds vp suckt vnto the cloudes dost bring and carry farre, O Rainebowe wondrous syght to men and Iunoes Messanger: And truely got of Thaumas olde, the daughter passyng fayre, Graunt I thee pray all darknesse fledde a cleare and Crystall ayre. Shut vp in caues of Eolus, the southwindes cause of rayne, And sende abrode the northerne blastes, to make fayre dayes againe. Immediately vpon these wordes, from out the northerne syde Did Boreas blowe, and with hys blast clearde all both rounde and wyde, Then sprinkling in mine eyes a iuyce, my guide, beholde quoth he, Now shall the secrets of the worlde, reueled be to thee. Now open wyde your springs, &amp; playne your caues abrode displaye, You Systers of Parnasus hyll, beset about wyth baye, And vnto me (for neede it is) a hundred tongues in verse Sende out, that I these ayrie kings and people may rehearse, Deceiuers great of men and guides of vice, which all that liue Doe styll molest: and by their craft mans soule to hell doe giue. Here fyrst whereas in chariot red Aurora fayre doth ryse, And bright from out the Occean seas, appeares to mortal eyes, And chaseth hence the Hellish night, wyth blushing beauty fayre, A mighty King I might discerne, placde hie in lofty chayre, Hys haire wyth fyry garland deckt, puft vp in fiendish wise, Wyth browes full broade, &amp; threatning loke, and fyry flaming eyes. Two monstrous hornes &amp; large he had, and nostrils wide in sight, Al black himself, for bodies black to euery euyll spright And vggly shape, hath nature dealt, yet white his teeth did showe, And white his grenning tuskes stode, large wings on him did growe, Framde like the wings of Flindermice his feete of largest sise, In fashion as the wilde Duck beares, or Goose that creaking cries: His tayle such one as Lions haue Al naked sate he there But bodies couered round about wyth lothsome shagged haire, A number great about him stoode, a wondrous sorte of men, A greater company I think than Xerxes trayned, when By force of armes (vnhappy man) the Greekes he did inuade: And scarce in safety could returne wyth al the flight they made, Eche one of them in hand a hooke did holde, and bellowes beare, Wyth bellowes for to fyll their heades, with winde, whom Fortune here, Had eyther lent great store of golde: or whome they saw ful well, In learning, beauty, state or strength, their fellowes to excell. Wyth hooke such as wyth want? wind were puft sufficiently, Amyd the smoky lakes to cast, wyth Snakes and Toades to lye. And other monsters there that dwelt. This lusty foresayd King, Tiphurgus had to name: as sayd my guide that tolde eche thing. Then where the S?ne doth downward fall, amyd the westerne streames: From whence among the Spaniards low he throwes his latest beames, I cast mine eyes, and like the fyrst another King in syght I had, that sate in seat aloft, his name Aplesto hight: A number great of sprites he rulde, such as amyd the west Are bred, and such as in those partes do dwel and haue their rest. Eche one of them a Serpent holdes, a flesh hooke also hath. Then spake Timalphes in this sorte: seest thou quoth he, to wrath How euery man their Serpents moue? and pinching oft do touch, That sharper may they set their teeth, and poyson more by much Destil in hearts of earthly men, for they on whome doth hitte, The force of those such poisoned teeth, do forthwyth lose their witte, And heauenly things do cleane despise: and wyth such thirst they broyle, That licoure none can them suffise wyth drink in vayne they toyle. And while thus euermore in vayne they drink and styll are drye, Unmindful of their death, theyr lot, themselues, and heauens hye: Then strayght at h?d these diuels come wyth hookes as here you see, And catcheth them, &amp; strykes the throtes that yet ful thirsty be To fling in flouds of thorney lake: where as wyth wondrous paynes They punnisht are wyth Monsters vile that secret there remaynes: Bloud specially wyth bloudsuckers that thick about them lies: And hyting styll, both day and night, them plages in piteous wyse. At length they yeld agayne the bloud, that whilst they here did liue They suckt from men, nor ease of smart no space of yeares can giue. This King both makes and plages such men as couetous he made. Thys sayd, I turnde my eyes to starres that glide in coldest glade, Wheras our Pole doth plaine beholde, and viewe the double beare, And where Bootes driues hys waine, in euer rowling spheare. And there an other king I see, and thousande spirites ill That dwel about those northerne partes whose handes great hookes doe fill. Then sayd my guide: this king y? raigns in partes of Boreas colde Of Lechery, and Glotonye, doth Crowne and Scepter holde. Philocreus eke to name he hath, in fraude full lyke the rest: O Lord with how great harmes doth he poore mortall men molest? For on these hookes that here thou seest the baytes that tast full well, He tyeth fast where poyson lurkes of filthy flouds of hell. And wyth these baytes he doth c?ma?de the doltishe fooles to take, And catcht in puddles to be cast of muddy miery lake. Who straight transformed into shape of vgglye beastes, appeares Both Swine and Asses, Bulles &amp; Foxe, and wolues, and lothsome Beares: And others Monsters voide of minde. Nor this doth yet suffyse, with Harnets, waspes, &amp; Betels blinde that rounde about there flyes, Continually they vexed are. Lo thus Philocreus men are plagued in piteous painefull wyse, That couet onely carnall ioyes, and vertue here despyse. Thus sayth my guide, but I my eyes about the southerne pole Do cast, fr? whence y? clouds are causde in euery place to rolle. with stedfast syght I note, what sort of sprites I there can see, And flocks of fendes w? wings full black that swiftly flying bee. Amongst them all a mighty king there stoode with Crowne of pride wyth lowring browes, and dogged looke and in hys mouth full wyde A monstrous tongue he hissyng shooke, and lyke the lothsome Snake He castes abroade from out hys throte a fylthy poyson black, Such as the adder (while he burnes wyth loue of Lamprey long, Much fearing for to harme his ioy wyth deadly venome strong) Casts vp among the ragged rocks, and hydes it secretly, And springing straight with lusty leape into the seas doth flye, And calling oft wyth hyssing sound doth seeke his louers deare, Who runnes to meete hir mate in hast, whose voyce she wel doth heare, And both wyth much embracing ioyne. But when their pleasaunt play Is fully past, and finished, the Snake wyth ioy away Doth swimme to land, and on the rocks whereas his poyson lay, He searcheth for his owne defence. which if he finde away, Or spylt, or troden vnder foote, such griefe he then sustaynes, That mourning, weary of his life he dasheth oft his braynes, Agaynst the sharp and ragged stones tyl that his breath at last Wyth al his wretched paynes &amp; griefe, by death be ouerpast. Such was this King, and such did seme his subiectes for to be: Oft tymes the Prince a paterne is vnto the commontie. with Fawchon great in right hand held eche one of them he goeth, Al black, both face, and teeth, and lippes al ful of fylthy froth. This King was Lord of enuy great Timalphes tolde me there, And that Miastor was his name, by whose awarde seuere, His seruants fyll the heartes of men wyth froth of canckred spyte. Then runnes the plague through euery veine, and euery where doth light, But most of al doth vexe the eyes, that they ne suffer may To see their fellowes lyue in wealth, but thereat pyne away. At last they thrust th? through w? dartes and soules ful sicke expell, Whereon wyth triple throte doth chaw the fiendish hound of Hel: And chawed, to pois? strong doth turn, and of their bodies spring Fowl Scorpions, which although they fawne wyth tayle do deadly sting. But now behold the middle partes, that in the ayre doth lye, And there Sarcotheus see, aboue the rest a King most hie, And of them al most mischieuous. The other Kings that be, Do feare and also worship hym, the power and rule hath he Of al the diuels in the world from whome the mischiefs al Do flowe as from a poynt: and as the beames from Phœbus fal. I then beheld this vggly fiend, placde vnder cloth of state, That in his hand the scepter held, of mischiefe pride and hate. From him doth spring ful bloudy c?bs, and seauen hornes in hight, The number like of lofty towers in shewe resembling right. His eares hys nostrilles and hys eyes all fyerie filthy glowe, And from his dampishe throte he doth the smoky flames out throwe, Alas, how farre the number great of hys companions spreade, What armyes armed all wyth dartes and gunnes, thys fiende doth leade: As if he would the heauens burst, and saincts from thence expell. Then quoth my guide: thys diuell once in beautie did excell, And most with God in fauour stoode: but minde disposed ill, And pryde to prosprous state alied, thys Miser quite did spyll. For lyke to God he nedes would be, and honours equall haue, And thus from thence was banished the proude presumptuous slaue. Whom Michaell as he was assynde, in grisley cloude hath tyde, And there apointed him hys place where he should styll abyde. But often, of hys olde estate, and ioyes of passed ryme Remembring well, in vaine he striues and thinkes the skyes to clime. Hereof doth come the thunder crackes, and fearefull flames of lyght, And gastly syghtes of fyre doe flashe, from cloudes as darke as night: The beastes for feare amased stande, and heartes of men doe quake. But vext in vaine, and to no ende hys trauayles doth he take, Nor nerer can he come to skyes. And he that guide of lyght was once, and called Lucifer, loues now to walke by night, And darkenesse best of all estemes, and leades with him hys sprightes, And bugges, and goblins grimme of hel and such deformed syghtes: Sometimes by day when as he ioynes a troupe of armed knaues, And strawes w? bloudy Corses y? fieldes, or drowneth shippes in waues, Or when such mischief great he works: Then comes he forth by lyght But close, and sendes abrode hys men in secret priuie plight, Which moues the hearts of wicked m? and them with fury filles, And secretely with sylent voice persuades theyr minde to ylles. But then quoth I: I thee beseeche my guide let vs now leaue These monstrous Diuels to beholde, and state of man perceaue: For from thys mount we easely may both lande and seas discrye, Nor profite small I thee assure in thys prospect doth lye. Then gased we both vpon the earth: and fyrst I wondred most, To see such diuers colours strange in men of sundry cost. For those that nerest leade theyr lyfe vnto the middle lyne, Are black, with blaberlips, and haire both curlde and crisped fyne, And naked cleane, or couerde else with skynne of Kiddes full yll. But such as dwell about the North, where Golde is quaking styll, In whytenesse seeme to passe the snow, and scarce they can expell Wyth garments long &amp; many clothes the colde that there doth dwell. Betweene these people all that be, wyth black and whyte are died, But more and lesse as farre and nere they from the Sunne abyde. Whyle thus I fondly wondred at the things that there I see, Why doest y? (quoth my guide) regarde the things that vaynest be? why viewest thou thus the colours vaine in fleshe of mortall man: Farre better shall it be for thee theyr manners well to scan, And diuers fashyons of theyr mindes, and works of them to see, wherby thou shalt beholde the lyfe of man, I shewing thee, And what confusyon is therein. Fyrst, fayne thou here a hande,At the end of this line is a small engraving of a hand. whose thombe directly vpwarde ryse and fingers open stande: And on the thombe place thou the men of best disposed minde, That worldly things doe here despyse, and things of heauenly hinde Doe onely seeke, and most esteeme dame wysedomes sacred grace, Delyghting nature to beholde, and hye Celestyall place, Unharmefull, gentle, louing best the vertuous things and right, Whom neither riches can corrupt, nor fleshely fonde delight, Nor glasse of pompous state alure: men of a heauenly kinde, And Gods incarnate here on earth, but rare and scant to finde. For all such things that perfect are are scarse and selde to see, O that the mighty Lorde would cause thee such a one to bee. Next standes to thys the forefinger, whereto thou shalt assyne Discretest men, the seconde sort, and good we them defyne, Yet leane they some thing to the world, as fyt to beare the sway In cities and in common wealthes, and banners to display, And fayth and iustice eke they loue, and vertuous seeke to be: Yet from the pleasures of the worlde they are not fully free. To whom if God at any time the rule and empire giue, Then comes the golden tymes againe, and vertue here to liue, And iustice to the earth returnes, and peace doth beare the sway, And vice with punnishement seuere is forced for to stay. The middle finger followes then, of estimation small, Whereon thou must apoint a place vnto those Minions all, Whose mindes are ready to conceiue, and wittes for to inuent, Whose tongs doe flowe with eloqu?ce, to vtter theyr intent: But wycked, and vniust they are and full of vyllanyes, And bending alwayes to the earth doe not beholde the skyes, A suttle sort, that foxes heartes within theyr guilfull brest, Doe alwayes beare, and symple soules with fraude doe styll molest. And when as most they vertue hate, yet lyst they for to seeme, Both good, and Godly men, and such, as vertue most esteeme, And otherwise than they do meane theyr tong doth talke alwayes: And all they doe is done for gaine, or else for hope of prayse, Nor lyfe but thys they none esteeme nor looke for to enioy. And these are they that euermore doe wise men most anoy, And armde w? fraude, on fauour staide (which eyther they obtaine, Wyth slauishe seruice done to them, or else with giftes doe gaine) The Godly purposes they let, and truth with craft they hyde: And if their cunning there doe fayle then force in tyme is tryde, Then vse they swords, or flames of fyre, or strength of poyson trye: And if they cannot closely hurt then worke they openly. With these such iolye seruitours in euery time, and place, The Diuel doth hys Kingdome kepe, and eke hys owne good grace. This staffe he chiefly leaneth on, wyth this great helpe and stay, He conquest makes vpon the earth, and brings them to obay. More crafty Knaues than wisem? liue, and stronger aye they be, That wyn the Palme, and triumph stil, wyth spoyle of honesty. Which when they scepter hold in hand, or rule in cyties beare, Then c?mes the yron world agayne, and Mars approcheth neare, Then fury conquers lawes and right, then lawful is it found For vice to lyue vnpunnished, then vertue lies a gro?d. No men more mischieuous than these among the mortal state Do liue, nor none there are that more the Gods aboue do hate. Now next in place the Fooles do syt, who presently must stand Upon the fynger fourth in place, of this thy fayned hand. Of Fooles the greatest number is: who doth not playnly know? Dame nature ioyes in making Fooles, as she doth oft to sowe Both Nettles, Docks, &amp; filthy Weedes dul wyt, and doltysh brayne These Idiotes haue, they seeke not for the ioyes of soule to gayne: And only of their lyfe, and panch, lyke beastes their God they make. These doltysh Fooles by thous?d wyles the crafty sort do take, And many false and wicked things to do, they them persuade, And wyth their language as they lyst do trayne them to their trade. For Fooles do quickly credit giue, as children also wyll, But sonest so vice: opinions worst in them appeareth styll, To whome is also worser minde: hereof it doth aryse That Foles beleue these crafty Knaues before the Godly wyse: For councel naught these Foxes gyue, and teach from truth to slyde, And vnderneath a paynted cote, the fylthy vice they hyde. But though by many meanes they do these foresayd doltes beguyle, Of superstition yet there is a playne and easy wyle, Wel knowen to al the worlds of olde: the which this subtile kinde Doth chiefly vse, for to the church of God themselues they binde, And holy rytes they minister. Then cause they sore to feare The blockish heartes of Idiotes, and them they threaten there, Except wyth giftes they please y? saincts except they do appease Wyth Golde the wrath of God for syn, and purchase their release, Which strayght these Prelats chast receiue, wherwith they fat and feede The Harlots and their Curtisans, and Mules to serue at neede. For who doth not the lyfe of Priestes both note and well beholde? And how they do poore Fooles deceiue: yet scape they vncontrolde: Such is the suffrance now of Kings, that onely do apply Their mindes to pastyme, belly cheare, and filthy lechery. These things the Gods do aye permitte that little seeme to wey What hands do deale their sacraments what hearts do them obey, What honours here on earth they haue or else what blasphemy. But now to Fooles I come agayne, whome when in seate on hie Hath Fortune placde for hir delight, O lord what number great Of Follies shalt thou then beholde? to long it were to treate. Then vertue made a iesting stock, and placde aloft is vice, Then daunces fonde, and bankettings, and playes are had in price: Then flock of Parasites and whores, in euery place are seene: Then filthy fond delight alone doth guide the soyle as Queene, For as the Prince is commonly so do the subiects lyue, And to the lyke behauiours aye themselues they alwayes gyue. Not onely pleasure vnto Fooles of kindred we do fynde, But anger oftentymes doth match hir self wyth Folish mynde: For Fooles are easely moued to wrath, and desprate enterprise, As oft as fury flames wythin and choller vp doth rise: Then wicked loue of weapon springs, and bloudy broyles thereby, That many corses gyue to death ful colde in graue to lye: A naughty kinde of men are these and much to be auoyded. The last the lyttle fynger is wherwyth the eares are scratched, And therfore calde the earefynger where mad men placed syt, That lack the vse of reason right, and that haue lost their wyt: Whose fury if it neuer ceasse, more fyt for them to dye It were, and from so great disease by meanes of death to flye. Of good men thus two only kyndes there are, and neuer more: The rest are alwayes naught and yll, auoyd them wel therefore, Or if thou canst not them auoyd, beware yet at the least Thou mouest them not, y? c?mon sorte, a fierce and cruel beast Do alwayes rage, and hurtful be. When thus Timalph had taught, May not (quoth I) these Foles &amp; wolues to good estate be brought? May vice by no meanes be expeld? or if there be a way Disclose to me. Then on thys sorte Timalphes gan to say: As nature in mannes body doth diseases diuers breede, So many Sicknesses to the mynde from hir do like proceede: And trauayle lyke to both hath dealt. Loe, how she man doth loue: Yet many succours hath she set for mortall mannes behoue, Which if she had not done, to sore and cruell had she bene. Therfore y? same that helpt hath harmd, and as to harme she is seene, So had she skyl to heale agayne: that iustly you may doubt A naturall Mother hir to cal, or else a stepdame stout. But now let vs the bodies griefes, and medcins for the same Passe ouer quite, in many bookes declarde of auncient fame: And of the minde as much as neede shal presently require, Let vs here speake to teach more plaine the thing thou didst desire. And first, as nature so disposing it the rude and countrey fielde, Uile Nettels, weedes &amp; brembels sharp continually doth yelde, Except it oftentimes be tilde, and eke wyth labour sore, The hurtful wedes with plough &amp; rakes be causde to grow no more, Nor this enough, it needeful is good seedes therein to cast, And dayly for to husbande it till daunger all be past. Euen so the minde whilst it is bounde wythin the body here, As ouergrowen wyth Bryars sharp, and wylde it doth appere: Except it ayded be wyth helpe of one that tilleth well, And aptly vertues therein plantes, and vices doth expell. But what is husbandry of minde perhaps thou sekest to know: Its wysedome, wisdome that I meane, that manners good doth showe, That makes men vertuous for to be, and playne doth teach the way To mortal men, of liuing right, and leauing for to stray, Persuading them to leade their liues in perfect Godly state, And righteousnesse to exercise, and sinnes to shunne and hate. This only is the wisdome true, and not that other kinde, Wherto Physitians and vayne clerkes do still apply their minde: Attempting causes hydde of things to bring abrode to light, And for to searche the secrete celles of nature, day and night: Materiam primam, and Vacuum, and thousande monsters more with blustring countn?ce belching out, that they might seeme therfore Well learnde, and stuffed full theyr purse with coyne may strayne. O goodly wised?e, whose learned youth doe eyther gape for gaine, Or smell with vaine ambition: but none amongst them thoe Doth vertuouser, from thence or better manerde goe, No teacher of the minde is thys, nor wysedome hir we call: But rather knowledge hath to name, if that she doe not fall, From doubtful pathes of men deceiude. who thys hath learned than No witt but knowledge gaines by it, and of a cunning man Perchance he beares the name, but not of wyse and prudent wyght. These two doe differ farre in state, and workes in diuers plight, From wisedome springes y? fruit of life, from knowledge the floure doth ryse, The one doth profite, ayde, and helpe, the other beautifies: The one respectes the inwarde things, the other outwarde shine, The one makes vertuous men, &amp; good, the other learned, and fyne. Thus wysedome onely decks the minde which manners God doth showe As I haue sayde, destroyeth vice, and vertue there doth sowe, And waters it with heauenly showers. O light of mankinde here, O perfite way of sauing helth, defence, and comfort clere, Both entry dore, and guide of lyfe O peace, and salue of minde, O blessed worthy sanctuary, O wysedome swetest kynde, That Nectar doest excell in tast, to whom art thou now dere? Who followes thee? what place hast thou on earth, what honours there? In Temples wast thou wont to raine, in schooles, and porches lowe, In Councelles, and in courts of kings, now no man doth thee knowe: But Poets dreames and tryfles fonde for thee in place doe raine. what learnes y? scholler now in scholes, what knowledge doth he gaine? But fansyes vaine, or baudy tales: beholde in seate full bye The Master syttes, with booke before that open wyde doth lye, And spitting oft he well doth viewe hys great assembled crowde, And when hee sees them bent to heare, wyth lofty voice and lowde, He then expoundes some dreadful ghost of dolefull tragedie, Or else some harlots trickes declares in wanton Comedie, Or doting loues of auncient time, or else to light doth bring Some monstrous, or some cruell fact, or lamentable thing. O brayne deseruing to be purged, doest thou these wayes instruct? The tender mindes and ignorant bring vp with such a fruict? Is this the salt wherof the age so yong is made to say? Is it not shame wyth tryfles such to passe the time away? By thys so many naughty knaues, and villaines doe appere: By thys the groue of vices thick vp springeth euery where: When as no vertuous bringing vp of Children can be founde. O you that youth do not correct, but rather them confounde, Learne fyrst your selues to liue vpright, and then to others showe A vertuous trade, least lyke to beastes you liue, and nothing knowe. But thou Stellatus harken well, to thee I will expresse which way thou shalt apply thy minde to perfecte vertuousnesse. Fyrst, oft in minde remember well one God alone to be, Eternall, best, omnipotent, and of most hye degre, Who heauen, and the golden Starres that shine throughout al the skye, The rest of things that may be seene, or not be seene wyth eye, Of nothing, with hys beck alone before all tymes hath made, And framde th? kepes, &amp; gouernes here with euerlasting trade. Hym worship, honor, feare and prayse, and often to hym praye, Both nights, &amp; dayes, when S?ne doth ryse and Sunne doth fall away, And when from both in equall space his Globe doth distant glowe: For vertue chiefe and wysedome chiefe, it is, the king to knowe. Of sainctes aboue, and father of men to loue with heart entire To prayse him alwayes and to dread, and humbly him desire. Without thys same all vertues else, think nothing worth to be, For almost thys, and nothing else sufficient is for thee. Therfore haue alwayes God in heart, and often in thy minde And call to him, nothing than thys more vertuous canst thou finde: Thys is to all the vertues else the open doore, and plaine, For without grace, and ayde of God, no man can them obtaine, Nor able be to flye from vice. Besydes the sayncts aboue that dwell, and hostes of messangers, And seruants of the chiefest Lorde, and holy Ministers, Fulfilling the commaundement of hys Maiestie deuine, That alwayes stand before hys face in skyes full cleare that shine: With holy minde remember oft in humble sort to praye, That they may helpe thee in thy neede, and daungers dryue awaye, And thee vnto the Lorde commende: for truely Aungels can, And often vse to profite much the earnest praying man. Nor, be not thou (beware therof) amongst such sort a mate, That think that nature neuer made a thing of hygher state Than man: mad men, y? when they see so plaine before their eye, Both seas and lande of Creatures full, doe thinke that in the skye, And in the Starres no dwellers be, and iudge the ample space Of blessed heauen for to be a voide, and desert place. O crabde, and crookde vntoward soules, O mindes in darkenesse drounde. Mans sense can not all things perceiue, for many things are founde That often tymes deceiue the eyes, which yet the minde doth see: Therfore what reason moues in minde must rather followed bee: Which teacheth that there is a God, and dwellers in the skye: Wherfore y? Starres are eyther Gods, Or Temples where they lye. These grounde workes layde, w? all thy heart, embrace thou righteousnesse, And let no iniury of thine be any mans distresse, By wordes or deedes no man can hurt, nor deale thou so wyth men As thou wouldst not be delt withall, but alwayes doe to them As thou wouldst they should do to thee: thus nature doth decree. Which if thou straightly dost not keeps giue credit vnto mee: Thou neuer canst be fauoured of that maiestie deuine, Nor after death vnhappy man thou shalt the heauens clime. An others honor, fame, or state, harme not in any case, When vile desyre doth moue, or wrathe or enuye comes in place: But rather helpe such as thou knowest to be of vertuous minde, With all thy force, and pleasure doe to men of wycked kinde Sometimes, that so they hurt thee not, or seldomer thee harme: And let not brybes, nor loue, nor hate, thy minde from iustice charme, For these are three especiall things that dasell sore the syght Of minde, and driue men euermore from doing well and right: But styll haue God in memory, and death to come in minde, Then flye the enticements of the flesh and byts of sharpest kinde On pleasure put: For nothing doth to man more mischiefe bring Than yll delight, to vertue sure a most contrary thing: For vertue laboures euermore the heauens hye to clyme, But pleasure ennimy to the skies doth downeward styll decline, And groueling gaseth on the earth, as beastes do commonly, Destroying strength of body here and force of minde: wherby It breedes a dull and slouthful sense, and sharp dyseases makes. This is that Circes, that Syren and hooke of Stygian lakes, With this same snare a n?ber great of soules, the Diuell takes, And suffers not them after death their countrey Skyes to see, But wyly wrappeth them in mystes of Hel his mates to be. These bayts therfore, thys poison swete of fylthy fiendish foe, Wyth al thy might auoyd them well, and warely from them go: Lest that when greater yeres do come, in vayne thou dost repent Thy selfe, thy substance, fame, and wit, so lost and fondly spent. Then shalt thou say as many do, O goodly tymes in minde, How vilely haue I you abused? where now should I you finde? Unhappy man: If God would graunt agayne my former tyme, And once againe the Samian branch I might assay to clyme, Thereto I would where as the earth his right horne forth doth stretch, Though that the way be strayt, &amp; steepe the top thereof to retch. No kinde of thing doth vertue passe, which alwayes doth remayne, Which honor giues, and hie estate, and glory great doth gayne, Preserues the life, and doth augment the goods that here you haue, And doth remaine, when death hath cast the fading corse in graue. But me vnhappy wretch alas did pleasure swete deceaue, And fled away doth me in briars and many mischieues leaue: For whilst that I in youthful yeares the stewes do oft frequent, And while to feeding, slepe, and play, my doltish minde was bent, Nought would I lerne, &amp; hating bokes, did study much despise, And learning scorne, but now alas I see before my eyes, My selfe vnlearnde, of yll report, in beggarly aray, My strength decayde, my minde appald, my senses worne away: Al this tyme haue I liued as he that lyes a sleepe in dreames, Doth think him self awake to be deceyued by such meanes. Like wordes to these doth vtter oft the slouthfull sluggish man, When age the neighbor nexte to death, doth count to late as than His life led yll in youthfull yeares. The greatest sort do shut the dore when Steede is stollen away: And wyse they are when as to late their wittes they do assay, And for Physitians fast they seeke, when hope of health is gone. O wretches whilst you here haue tyme, looke wel thys tyme vpon: For fast away the houre flyes, and fled can not retourne, No teares can help the corse in graue, nor sobbes for him to mourne: That medcine only is of force which is in time applyed, Therfore must vertue be embracde, when youth is fyrst in pryde: And then it nedeful is to treade the perfect path of lyfe, And vertuous workes to take in hand, then reason must be ryfe, And minde wyth councel must be rulde while yet but yong it is: Least that with fonde delight deceyude, it headlong runne amysse. Who so is wyse let hym in tyme wyth wisedome wel prouide, For afterwyttes are euermore to folly next alied: And out of tyme it bringeth griefe bewayling al in vayne, A hurt or losse that neuer can be brought or got agayne. Besyde, the wicked thirst of wealth, and vile desyre of golde Must thou eschew, for where a place this couetousnesse doth holde There rayne almost eche other vice: as shameful periuries, Ungodlinesse, theft, and disceyt, wyth open robberies, Guyles, treasons, and conspyracies, wyth frayes and murders vile, What needes it for to shew them all? nothing besyde more vile, Nor worse than is the couetous man, that drownde in earth belowe, Doth like the Mole no kinde of thing desyre, loue, or know Saue only riches of the earth for which he doth not feare Eche yll to work, nor other God he doth acknowledge here, But purse and pens his chiefe delight: nor sees the vnhappy best Now short the lyfe of man is here, how frayle, how sone deceast, And how that from his bending bow death euermore doth cast His deadly shaftes, that pearceth hearts of mortall men so fast, And neyther spares the yong nor lernd, nor yet the wealthy wyght: But euery man wythout respect wyth bloudy blow doth smyte: And oftentimes is neerest then, when furthest of he showes, And sodaine tumults then doth cause when no man of hym knowes. But thou regarde not ryches here, nor goods that subiect he To blinded chaunce, nor let no care of such things trouble thee: For proper vnto no man are the things, which as the lykes Doth fortune giue, and takes away when she vnconstant strykes: Or passing doth wyth lyfe away to diuers men descend. Nay, other riches shalt thou seke that neuer shal haue ende, On which no cha?ce nor kinde of death, shall euer powre obtayne: These riches labour thou to get both dayes and nightes with payne, For that thou shalt be truely rich, and truely blest by that. The others that the common sorte like fooles do wonder at, And wish to haue, if thou enioyest, as money, house and land, Them vse and occupy at wyll, who doth agaynst it stand? But iustly yet, and modestly, and when thou maist or can, Haue pity on the pouerty, despise no needy man. By this meanes shalt y? wyn thee praise and health for euermore, And for this earthly baggage here the Skies aboue shalt gayne. No man is he, but sure a wolfe that doth not mercy showe, That is not moued to see the state of others ouerthrowe. But if of poore estate thou arte, then beare it paciently, And in good part sustayne the lotte of this thy pouerty: For greater ouerthrowes hath he, and greater griefe and care, Whome Fortune most enriched hath, and giuen the greater share: And so much ouerlayd he is, wyth wayght of substance great, That by no meanes he can beholde the hie celestial seate. For light, and voyde of earthly dregges it him behoues to be, That wil with minde ascend the place where as the heauens be. For more a man seekes earthly state, more falles he from the Skye, And from the euerlasting light he farther of doth flye: And eke in place where as a man his treasure vp doth hyde, There lies his heart, and there his mind doth euermore abyde. Thus prouertie helpes many men vnburdning them therby That so wyth swifter wyngs they may vnto the heauens flye. In lyke sort pride thou must auoyde the spring of stryfe, and hate, That with discention many times destroyes a common state. wyth thys disease in auncient time was Rome nere ouerthrowne, Opprest wyth rage of fury fierce, that ciuill warres had blowne. Flye thou thys fiende of hell, if thou desyrest for to bee A friende of Gods, and after death the Heauens clere to see: No proude man loues the Gods aboue, nor is beloued of them: For God estemes the humble sort and lowly minded men, And well he lykes the gentle mindes where no ambition lyes, Thrustes downe y? proude, &amp; suffers not to dwell with him in skyes. wherfore you proude disdainful swarme what doth your pryde you gaine? What helpes your great renoumed names and princely titles vaine? which death in shortest time doth spoile, and in the streame hath dronde Of Lethes flouds, where synking lowe they neuer can be founde. You seeke to please the common sort, and of them praysde to bee, Tell, what discretion hath that state the truth of things to see. They count you here as Gods to be, and what doth follow then? When Asses here in deede you are with outwarde signe of men, Th' vnskilfull sort you doe deceiue, but not the Gods aboue: But rather them to laughter oft, and oft to wrath you moue: For all your prety prankes they marke, and priuie deedes they see, But you O blinded Asses thinke no Gods at all to bee, Nor yet beleue the Corse in graue, the soule shall ryse to dome, And therfore seke these present ioyes, and scorne the lyfe to come. A number great of beastes aliue in shape of men doe straye, Hence springeth vp your errour great and cause of your decaye, That with your grosse capacitie, no other thing you see but bodyes grosse, nor true things know but such as shaddowes bee. The greatest sort delight in smoke, and full with smoke they flowe, O fooles what lighter thing th? smoke, what thing doth vayner showe? Or what may more be laughed at? than honor to pursue All vndeserued, and to despyse the cause of honor true, We see yll men, vnlearned and fonde, in place aloft to stay, And guide such as doe them excell, whom they should rather obay. For spitefull fortune styll doth sport in mortall mans estate, And out of order all confoundes, as she doth lyke, or hate: Oft tymes exalting to the starres the slouthfull seruile kinde, Deseruing fetters for to weare, or in the mille to grinde. But if she were of good estate, she would the world commit Of wyse men to be guided here, as meete it is and fyt: Then all things should in order passe, and lawes in strength should stande, And holy Sacraments be delt by Godly Prelates hande: And God would then contented be to shewe himselfe in syght. But harebrainde Fortune alwaies doth in counterfaites delight: Yet thys thalmighty Lorde permittes. Who could it well correct, And why should not we suffer it? For vnto what effect Is it, the truth with reason strong to maintaine, and defende Preuayling not but get thereby displeasure in the ende? For wysedome is c?temnde, &amp; harmde, with which no force doth raine, Whom no authoritie supportes, nor honour doth maintaine. Therfore it is better not to speake: despyse thou in thy minde The foolishe common peoples prayse, and gyftes of Fortune blinde, Applye thy selfe to please the Lorde, wyth deedes of vertuous kynde, And after death true honor thou, and true renoume shalt finde: That for the iust and Godly men, prepared is in skyes, Wheras the milde and lowly hearts, doe ioy in ioyfull wyse. But proude men wofully doe wayle in smothring fiery smokes. Now last of all restraine thy wrath, for anger rage prouokes, And rage doth cause vnsemely wordes, of naughty wordes doth spring Both brawles &amp; frayes, of frayes comes wo?ds, &amp; wo?ds do slaughter bring. Anger doth so confounde the minde, that dronke when bloud doth frye It knowes not what to doe, and voide of iudgement runnes awrye: Sraight griefe &amp; shame ensues y? deedes done vnaduisedly. Shunne thys, guide minde, &amp; winne thy selfe with bearing manfully. A goodly vertue pacience is, which who so is without Must needes of force lacke honestie, with cruell minde and stout, Still vsyng for to braule and fight. Frayes fittest are for beastes, And quiet peace is farre more meete to dwell in mortall breastes. The wyse, &amp; vertuous man, sekes peace all other things before, And suffers things of smaller waight, for feare of mischiefe more, And well takes heede, least that the cole that yet but kindling lyes, Wyth fiery force of flashing flame aloft at length aryse. Who naught can beare, let him absent himselfe from company, And leade hys lyfe alone in woods, or else on mountaines hye. And he that dwelles in company, let him learne much to beare, And to restrayne with brydle sharpe the wrath that him doe steare, Dissembling closely wyth himselfe his anger that doth spring, And neuer breake the bondes of peace for euery tristing thing, Forgiuing still the faultes of those that hym offended haue, That he may so forgiuenesse get, as he to others gaue. Thus much of trayning of the minde I thought it good to touche, Which doth suffyse: to these I coulde haue added more by much, But he that doth obserue these fewe shall neuer want the rest, But easely all them obtaine that are not here exprest: They all contayned priuily, and closde in these doe lye. But yet it nedefull is the whyle the wysemens bookes to applye, And causes for to searche of things, and to adorne the minde With diuers artes: for voyde therof it is both dull, and blinde. And thus, as hath bene sayde before, those fooles, and foxes, well May vertuous be, and frame th?selues in seate of blysse to dwell. These th?gs while as my guide declarde in presens Mercury, The poste of Gods, and Atlas Sonne, sent downe from Ioue stoode by: And willde Timalphes in hast the heauens to ascende, For all the saints (quoth he) are willde on Ioue for to attende, And Momus there appointed hath of wayghty affayres to treate. If certaine Monks (that placed are vpon the hauty seate, That harde besyde the citie standes, where passing by the walles To Venize goolfe the fyshie streames of Ariminum fall) Of lyuing shall depriued be, or else those partes forsake That contrey women vse to cut when they theyr Capons make: Since that they are to coltishe waxt, and beare their heddes to hye. Despisyng men, and filthy factes commit licenciously. Example taking of their Prior, fye, fye, to great a shame. And can the Church abyde to see such Porkettes as these same? That only liue to serue their paunch, their lust, and sleepy sense, Which heard, in hast Aretes sonne departing straight from thence, Did me commyt to Mercury, who going downe to Hell, The speciall message of hys Lord vnto the fiende to tell: Me fast embracing in his armes did through the cloudes conuay To ground, what time as Clement Pope in campe with Cæsar lay Within the walles of Bononye, and Florenze City fayre With mighty force did long besiege. Thus cutting swift the ayre With wyngs, at length came Mercury to rockes that ragged lye, Of S. Marinus, hauty hylles, that seeme to touch the Skye: From thence in small descent he set me in thy fieldes so gay Verruculus, and then to Hell in haste he takes his way. Capricornus, the tenth Booke. Al haile to thee good Mercury, from Stygian lake so soone Art thou returnde? declare what things in Plutoes court are doone: Great brawles, &amp; raging mad vprores, what is the cause or why? I wyll thee tell, although in haste I must to heauen flye. So great a sort of Turkes and Iewes, and Christians there remaine, That place therein suffiseth not, the number to contayne: No empty rome there is, but all ful thwact as they may be, The Porches full, and ful the Hall, and full the courtes I see, The Temples, houses and the Streates the Walles, and Market rowe, And al the City fieldes, and hylles and wooddy valleyes lowe, So full that crowding thick they thrust, and shoue wyth diuelish might: With fyst and heele, and tuske, &amp; tooth, in cruel sort they fight, For of no weapon haue they skill, nor sprites can euer dye: Scarce could I passe the place vnto whereas the fiend doth lye, But through y? mydst of swarming soules, wyth force I make my way, And wyth this rod to get me roome amongst them fast I lay: At length the priuy chaumber of the black and vggly sprite I come vnto, whom there I fynde in sad and doleful plight. And when to him I had declarde my fathers full decree, Commanding him that Antechrist should strayght vnlosed be From out the pyt, and sent abrode to euery place and land: That working wonders strange &amp; false and teaching that at hand The dreadful day of iudgement is, and ende of all the rest, May al thing out of order bring, both Gods, and man, and beast, As fixed state of destiny commaundeth to be had: God Pluto then tell me quoth I why sytste thou here so sad? So sad quoth he: doest thou not thinke, to great a wrong I byde, When you possesse so great a space of heauen large and wyde? When as but fewe you are, and when scarce three (when all is done,) Or little more, in greatest space and tract of tyme do come: And I to be enclosde within a kingdome here so small, Where out of number mortal men continually do fall: The Iewes and al the Turkish broode, not all the Christian bend (I graunt) but sure the greatest parte, do here, do here descend, And hither to my parkes they runne: why come they more to me? Or why doth not my brother there that Skies doth ouersee These Friers, Priests, &amp; Monks at lest take vp to heauen hye, And them in blessed place wyth him preserue continually? Is is not shame, these men that in the Church so swetely sing, And day by day, in sacred towers the restlesse bells do ring, That spend such store of Franconcense, and many Hores relieue, That pardon others, and can not their owne mysdeedes forgiue, That play the parts of paryshe Clerke, the Corse to bring to graue, And beautify the Church of God, with Tombs and Pictures braue, Is it not shame these men to sende to Hell, with paynes therfore, As thirsty Appulia neuer bred of Flyes a greater store? Nor once the chiefest Bishops he doth dread, or more forbeare, But rather wylls that they do feele extreamest torments heere: Thus in the deepest pyt of Hel enclosde they lye in chaynes And plaged are aboue the rest with grieuous kinde of paynes. Wherfore Cyllenius when thou comste the Starres aboue vnto, I pray thee shew my brother there that al things I wyl do With willing minde as he c?maundes; But yet in any wise Let him respect my poore estate, and kingdome not despise, And either take some soules from hence or else make Hel more wyde: This sayd, I wyll (quoth I) and then from thence in haste I hied. And now to Heauen I retourne nor longer can I stay: Forget not me thy client poore go blessed sainct away. Thou Muse remembre well to shewe to me thy verses fine, For paper lowe at hand, and pen, and leysure good and tyme: Beginne and teache me in what sorte a wyse man should be wrought. Fyrst vnderneath a happy starre he must to light be brought, That after shall be wyse or blest: for greatly matter makes Under what signe or what aspect, a man his byrthday takes: As they affirme that know the names, and force, and motions hye Of Starres, and cast natiuities, and tell the destiny. O Lord how great and wonderous doth heauens force appeare, Wythout whose help the earth nor seas, could euer creature beare. The Skye the Occean representes the father here of all, And stars the syster Nimphs by name full aptly may we call, Fr? whence procedes al good on earth, therfore can no man liue As wise and blest, wh? starres in byrth, an yll aspect do giue. Beside of great effect doth seeme their parents state, and kinde, Of whome the infant nourced is, and who doth guide the minde. For as the childe in tender yeares himself at fyrst doth trayne, Such custome shal in grauer age within his heart remayne: Long time that nature doth endure, and long in minde doth lye, That in our childish age at fyrst, our senses did apply. Therefore the master needes must be both wyse and learned well, That guides the childe, and also must to vertue him compell. And like the horsman good, now here, now there must winde and wreste The vntamed head, and now with bytte and now wyth spurre molest: Nor only him with words persuade, but with examples teache: For what if life be contrary auayleth it to preach? And fyrst be dilligent to kepe him from the vicious kinde, Ill company doth oft corrupt a good and vertuous minde: This poyson many hath destroyed, wouldst thou be glad to tell The nature iust of any man, then marke his fellowes well, For lyke to lyke doe euer goe, and alwayes shalt thou finde That conuersant are such as be of one disposed minde. wherfore let both the schoolemaster, and parents well beware, Least him whom they doe thus instruct the naughty youth doe snare, And them with filthy crimes infect: alas full sone we all Enclyned are vnto the worse, and sone to vice we fall. Besydes thys childe that here we fayne a wyse man for to make, Let him in Greeke, and latine bookes, his daily trauaile take, And giue good wyll and diligence in learning to procede, Refusyng al vnhonest bookes let hym good aucthors reade: For seldome is the vnlearned good, for ignorance doth blinde, And darkes with errours commonly the rude vnskilful minde. But yet from to much study and toyle let him hys minde refraine, Least he proue mad, in searching thus thys wysedome to attaine: Or fall into some great disease and so himselfe destroy: To much of euery thing doth harme and long doth not enioye. His sprites sometime to recreate, and to refreshe his minde, Let him absent him selfe and playe: for rest in euery kinde Doth quicknesse bring, and play in time doth former force repaire. But though eche kindes of learning is both nedefull good and faire. Yet chiefe among the rest are those, and hyghest place obtaine, That teacheth well y? Starres to know, and nature opens plaine, Let these our wyse men well apply with all hys force and might, In grauer age, and in these artes let him spende hys delight: And therwithall (as hath bene sayde) the nurture of the minde Well put in vre, both iust and good shalbe and so shall winde About hys head two Lawrell twistes. How goodly a thing is it A man both learned and good to bee, to knowe, and to haue wit? A learned foole is to be fearde, lyke as the furious braine. With sworde in hande, so is the learnde in whom doth vice remaine. But yet suffyseth not alone: the minde for to regarde, And wyth good manners, &amp; good artes to haue it thus preparde: When as the state of body here we must not lightly way, For if the body be diseased it neuer can obay The hestes of minde, y? doth commaund both worthy things and great. Wherfore we must our selues apply to feede on holesome meate, That may engender purest bloud: for hurtfull humour springs Of euill meates most commonly, and such vnholsome things. All dronkennesse must be eschewed, and surfets must be fled, For these the stomacke ouercharge, and much anoye the head, And rounde wyth fumes beset the brain, by thys doth alwayes come The dull appalled sense and spryte, and sleepes of afternoone. To exercise the body well in due conuenient time, Is great commodity to health, and makes the force more fyne: By to much slouth doth strength decay, and by to long a rest. The synowes faynt, and all the lymmes by thys are quite opprest. Besyde must colde extreme be shunde, and heate that raging broyles, And all corrupt and filthy ayres, and fennishe moory soyles: Especially in sommer tyme, when dogge with fyerie teene Doth cleaue the fieldes, &amp; Grashoppers syng vnder braunches greene. In fine our selues we must apply with all our force and might, To bodyes health, that so it may obey the minde aright, Which scarse can wel be brought about if pouertye denye: Needes must we money haue by cha?ce or gift of some that dye, Or else by trade of occupying in any facultye, For euermore the nedy man doth suffer miserye: Nor without riches, possible a happy lyfe to leade, Alas how often vertue poore doth mourne with heauy heade? How much despysed she styll doth lye if money be away? Him truely and in proper kinde a ryche man call we may That flowes with wit, and eloquence, with wysedome and with art, And wheresoeuer he becomes can gaine an honest part, And portion for himselfe to liue, and though he iorney makes To diuers places farre from home, hys substance with him takes, And neuer wanteth needefull things a ioyfull lyfe to leade, Nor feare the theeues, nor doth y? sword, or cruell robbers dreade, And quickly doth hymselfe repaire though he be spoyled quite: For vertue true giues neuer place to Fortunes frowning spite. For euery dwelling in the worlde doth natiue soyle appere Unto the vertuous man, and well he liueth euery where. But he that vertue lackes, although he great possessions holde, And purses stuffed full wyth coyne, and Coffers full of golde, Yet can he not go where he lyst, nor trauaile euery place, To see the countreys straunge abrode, and men of sundry grace, And euery were to liue: for house, and grounde, and Castels strong, He can not beare about wyth hym in all hys iorneys long, Least y? perchaunce w? theeues he meete, or perishe on the shore, And then for Gods sake aske hys meate at euery other dore. At home therefore he alwayes dwels, and in hys countrey lyues Where as hys ground a great increase of Corne and wyne hym giues, And as a banisht man he feares beyonde the boundes to go, That slouthfulnesse of minde, &amp; chaunce to him assigned so: Wherby the goodly syghtes abrode he can not viewe nor marke, Whyle still at home he hidden lyes as pent in dongeon darke. Therfore the olde Philosophers by fine inuention founde, A certaine stone, that where they went or trauailed any grounde, Prouided them of needeful things, and neuer would decay, By ayde wherof, full many landes and countreys farre away They might hehold, and alwaies learne of many sundry artes. And thus of olde the Gods aboue besought with humble heartes, The sacrifyce on altare slaine before as was the trade To Mercury, the Sunne, and Moone, Lo thus their prayers made. O Titan, beauty of the worlde, O fayrest God in syght, O thou Latonia dryuing hence the shadowes of the nyght, O swyftly fleeting restlesse Impe of Ioue and Maia borne, That able arte to chaunge thy selfe to shapes of sundry forme: Be present here, and bowe your eares to our complaints and crye, Beholde a fewe, whose mindes &amp; wittes are in degree full hye, That wisedome most of all esteme, whyle cause of euery thing, And secrete state of nature hyd to lyght we seeke to bring, And meat with minde the mighty skye: vs neede doth ouertread, And many great missehappes we feele, of hunger almost dead: Whyle as the doltishe common sort doe all things rake and snatche, And all the money heaping vp into their coffers catche, Nor any of them doth pity vs, and if we aske a myte, Then poynting at vs straight they iest, and make of vs but light: Wherby we are constraynde to delue, or else attendance gyue On toyling beastes, or cary doung, scarce know we how to lyue: And Idiotes are we made to serue. Wherfore you Goddes aboue Haue pyty yet at length of vs, if good mennes stare you moue, And shew an easy way by which we may liue honestly, And for to search the secrete dennes where truth doth hydden lye. These prayers hearde, the Gods anone thus calde came forth in place, And fyrst did Phebus aunswere make: O noble worthy race Of halfe Goddes, Skies deseruing wel and fauour eke from hye, Now hearken wel, and in your mindes let these my sayings lye Take here this yong Archadian bloud, and swyft vntrusty swayne And plunged deepe in Stygian streates, let him forthwyth be slayne: In bosome thrust of Hyales him let the Gods receaue, Whome Lemnian countrey worshippeth and hye aloft him heaue: Then bury him in warmed wombe, and corrupted him vndoe, Whose dropping ioyntes a sprite shall pearce that falles our bodies fro, And wondrously shal call agayne, deceasde and quenched quite Him from the darke new clad in cloke, of golde, and shining bright Wyth syluer shew, then him agayne amyd the fyer cast: An other strayght shall spring thereof, as Phœnix chaunging fast, And perfect leaue the bodies all that it shall feale or touch, The bondes and lawes of nature here, surmounting aye by much, Shal chaunge the kindes &amp; driue away, this needy pouerty. Here Phebus ceasde, and Mercury, and Dian did agree To all that he declared had, forthwith away they flye, Ascending to the lofty place and compasde heauens hye. Then men of hauty sense they blinde, and aunswere all to darke, Long pondring in their doubtful minds do muse theron and marke, And scarce in longest race of tyme wyth proues of sundry kinde, And not wyth little charges did this arte at fyrst out finde, Than which no arte more worthy is, the heauenly stone to frame, Which wicked people neuer knowe, nor can obtayne the same. And this whosoeuer doth enioy may dwell in any land, Both free fr? feare of fortunes wheele, and force of robbers hand: But vnto fewe the Gods vouchsaue so great a gift to giue. Some wil demaund if it be meete for wyse men here that liue, To linck themselues in wedlocks bond, and so the time to spend In procreation here of youth. Though some do this commend, Yet this in mine opinion is for holly men not meete, For care of wife doth often let, and loue of children sweete, The wyttes deuine of wysest men, that do their mindes apply About such hye and hauty things, as secretes of the Skye. Let him that only seekes the worlde reioyce in wyfe and childe, And often to himselfe procure the Gods of Mariage milde: But let the wiseman alwayes ioye in chaste and single plight, And euermore liue vndefilde in body and in spright. For he that doth wyth slender fare and small himselfe content, And doth abstayne from carnal vse, and prayer styll frequent, And lifting minde aboue the starres beholdes the chiefe degree, Shal oft enioy the speach of God, and oftentimes him see, In happy state, shall tell before the things that after spring. A sacred Gemme is chastitie, to God most thankfull thing, Unto the chaste he oft appeares, and secretes oft doth tell: Againe the filthy lecherye and pastimes meete for hell, He hates &amp; shunnes and alwayes doth such wanton mates detest. But no man can a Uirgin be but he whom God hath blest, And doth assyst: Thys gratious gyft doth from the skye descende, Of higher state than man can get, or man can comprehende: No perfite wyseman can be had except in thys degree. It semeth also good to knowe if it conuenient be For wysemen dreadfull weapons fierce of raging Mars to trye, And for to bathe their hands in bloud, of mortall enimie, And to themselues by fight to get an euerlasting name: For many iudge no greater ver- tue, glory, prayse, or fame Can be, than gotten is by warres. O wretched beastes, O blinde, Why think you wars more worth than peace, or of a better kinde? For nothing is more vile than thys, nor nothing can be found, That farther from mans reas? seemes, to differ or to sound: For if that lawes and reason shoulde in euery place beare sway, Then peace shuld rayne in proper force and warres shuld quite away: In tyme of battayle lawes do ceasse, and ouerthrowen do lye, Then fury raynes, and vice doth rage, abrode at liberty, Then wicked men holde vp the head, and shake their weapons than, And scotfree thence they kyl and stryke, and take from euery man, And fearing no decree of iudge, defile eche thing they finde More mete is peace for mortal man, and warres for brutish kinde. To tosse the blades mad men loue, and he desires to fyght, That pore and lazy labour hates, and hath a great delight To liue a lusty vicious state, though purse do not agree: And therfore sells his lyfe for gayne, and runnes in ieopardie, Then conquerour he triumph may with that that others got. And carry thence the spoyle and pray vnto his natiue plot. But he that substance hath at home, and can sufficiently Him self and his defend and keepe wyth any faculty, Doth peace aboue the rest esteeme, and from the sword abstayne: Except he be of franticke minde, and fond disposed brayne. But thou wylt say great Kings &amp; dukes in deedes of armes delight, And trayne themselues to follow Mars, wyth al their force and might: What then, are not gret Kings &amp; dukes oft times in dotage brought, And flow w? vice? by whose fond mindes great cities come to nought. And though they great reuenewe haue, and Kingdomes many one, Yet more they alwayes seeke to haue, and more they heape thereon. The couetous man though he possesse, as much of golden Myne As Tagus hath, yet pore he is and liues in neede and pyne. And thus therfore with this mad minde are Dukes and Princes great Compelde to ioyne the bloudy campes, wyth rage of Martial heate, Enlarging their dominions much with heapes of Misers slayne. But though that wars be nought, &amp; vile to be abhorred playne, Yet bring they some commodity, for false and crafty men, Expert in fraud and vsury, do heape vp al thing then When peace doth rain, but wh? y? wars do rage, the Souldiour strong, The euil gotten goods doth spoyle that he hath raked long. Then iustly doth the rage of Wolues on Foxes vengeance take, And due rewardes the mighty sort vnto the subtile make. And lyke for lyke they shew. Thus time doth all things alter so, Besydes, the kings w? thousande crafts, and thousande powlings mo, In time of peace their subiectes fleese, and coyne in Coffers poure, Wherby both Golde and Siluer all the Checker would deuoure, If battaile should not bring abrode that hydden lay in peace Distributing to many men one priuate mans encrease. Now last of all, in number not a fewe, there is a kinde Both voide of learning, welth, &amp; Arte, of lasey slouthfull minde, To mischiefe giuen, prone to vice, and stoute, and full of cryme: Such men, or rather shadowes vaine at one appointed tyme Doth God a warfare sende, wyth death of cruell kinde to dye. And thus he purgeth mortall state, whereby liue merily Long time the rest that doe remaine, thys mischiefe ouerthrowne, Tyll that againe such wicked weedes anewe be sprong and growne, That must be rooted out with warres, and cut with weapon grimme. Then Iupiter beginnes againe hys pottes vncleane to skimme, And sending forth the furyes vile, doth sweepe the filth away, This is the order of the worlde that neuer shall decay: Thys course the destinies themselues decreede long tyme agone, When as Promotheus stale the fyre the hawtie heauens from, And when Deucalion with hys wife dame Pyrrha, made to spring So many thousande persons with the stones that they did fling. Wherfore a wyseman it becomes to follow reasons grace, And chiefly peace to loue, and peace with all hys minde to embrace. Except percha?ce sometyme c?strainde he for his countrey fyght, And for defence of him and his, then is the quarrel right: Then fights he voyd of any blame, for lawes of euery state Do suffer force with force to dawnt, and guile with guile to mate, As due desertes to recompence conuenient is and meete. Now farther must we search if that it be for wisemen feete To exercise some faculty, wherwith al times he may Relieue himself if that missehappes do bring him to decay, If froward Fortune any time send needy pouerty, Depriuing him of all his goodes and substance violently, Least that he begge and suffer oft both colde, and hunger to. There are for truth some kinde of thing, that wisemen wel may do, Wherby himself he succour may if pouerty constrayne, Let him a good Phisitian be: this gets sufficient gayne, And driues away diseases quite. Olde Phebus vsed this same, And Phebus sonne, by this they both deserude a famous name. And this Sir Chirons pupil learnde though of the stock he was Of auncient Aeacus and Thetis sprong, by this did Pæon pas, Machæon and Hippocrates by this gat honour great. What should I call to memory at such as by this feate, Got long agoe both pens and prayse, and fame when they were dead. A good expert Physitian shal neuer begge his bread, Adde more to this, it ful besides of priuy knowledge flowes, And both of floure, hearb, and stone, doth secretes playne disclose: And whatsoeuer earth doth here within hir bowels hide, Doth well perceiue, and natures force to open doth prouide: Eche part within the body of man it doth consyder well, And turnes againe a number that were almost gone to hell. What thing than this more requisite. for wyse men can we finde? That not alone the wiseman may with counsell heale the minde, But also get the body helth, and so both partes redresse: Thus may a wyseman all preserue in perfect quietnesse. But now when as dame Lachesis the latest yeare doth spinne, And hoary whitenesse doth defyle both head and bearded chinne, Then meete it is for him to rest, and then himselfe to stay, And longer not to roue about in countreys farre away: But finde some certaine dwelling place, and searche for hys auaile Such things as nedefull are for lyfe, least foode in age doe fayle: And in the meane whyle to depart, and shunne the common sort, Contenting hym with fellowes fewe, and wyth a slender port, And solitary oftentimes: to God both night and daye, The mind wel purgde of naughty thoughtes, in feruent sprite to praye: And wholly to addict himselfe the heauenly state to finde, And all the cares that fleshe doth giue, to banishe from his minde. Then shall the Gods appere, though he in valley lowe doe lye, Or on the hylles, or shadowy woodes, or on the mountaines hye, In cottage small do place himselfe. it is not safe nor well With many for to liue, or in the townes of fooles to dwell, And in the company of theeues, of slaues, and couetous And cuthrote brawling swering mates, or men ambitious. But let the wyseman flye the croude or rude and common sort, For of the common people is enuied the wysemans port, Bycause of their contrary deedes: contraries euermore Do one the other striue agaynst and let, and hinder sore. Hereof haue many wisemen dyed, bycause they would not spare When any naughty thing they saw, the truth for to declare, And to rebuke the mindes of Fooles, which sith it could not beare, Nor suffer such abuse of Fooles, they slayne and punnisht were. Wherefore, least that the wiseman see such store of synful syght, And least he fall in daunger by defending truth and right, Let him wythdraw himselfe forthwith from common company: And secret liue with two or three that good and learned be, Though seldome shal he be without the Gods that guide the sky, For Gods do often pleasure take in wisemens company: Oft doth the wiseman heare them speak and seeth them oft with eyes, They fil his heart with comfort greate in wondrous sorte and wise: The wiseman blessed is on earth, and blest aboue in Skies: Go then O blinded mortal men, go heape vp money than, And fyll your caskets full of Golde by al the meanes you can, Beset with rings your fyngers thick, and set the Iewels round In gorgeous linckes of golde about your gracelesse neckes be wound, Now ruffle in your sylkes abrode, and brag it through the streete, Go, go I say you blinded fooles, both Crownes and Scepter sweete, And al that Fortune rash can giue to you with al your power Go seke: yet all these goodly things shal vanish in an houre, Al these things are but dreames &amp; toyes and haue but little stay, Which quickly chaunce doth from you take or death doth snatch away, Which sone doe vanish h?ce like smoke and neuer turne agayne. Go, go O wretches seke to get these mystes, and shaddowes vayne. But when the dying day shal come, and latest houre shal fall, Then, then when all your follies past in vayne to minde you call, You shall perceyue that you did dote, and stept from truth awry, And mourne to late. Alas in tyme your errour learne to spy. O mischieuous vntoward soules, O heartes of canckred kinde, Why gaze you styll vpon he earth like beastes of brutish minde? Why cast you not your eyes aloft vnto the starry Skies? There, there y? truest world doth stande there life most perfect lies, For such as feare aad worship God: there neyther chaunce hath place, Nor churlish death can there the state wyth deadly darte deface: There is the assured treasure found, there lies the chiefe delight, That God almighty hath preparde for them that serue him right: Which neuer curse of fretting time hath power to ouerthrowe, To this apply your mindes while states permit, and life below. Beholde you not of fading life the slender holde and stay? Do not you see how all things here in shortest time decay? And lyke to smoke in subtile ayre doth vanish quite away. Where finde you now the stately kings in pomp of proud aray That heretofore haue bene? or where, do you esteme to be The Prelates chief that thought th?selues Gods fellowes in degree? Their rotten bones entombed close in fylthy caues do dwell, And for their soules perhaps they do kepe Christmasse now in Hell: Farre banishde from the happy place wherto the good are brought, And there they suffer payne, for pryde, and mischiefe that they wrought. O Lord how gladly would they nowe if in their power it lay, Enclose themselues in flesh agayne, and take their olde aray, That not esteming riches here, and kingdomes leauing cleane, They might liue Godly here on earth, in pure estate, and meane, And by their righteous lyfe make hym their frende that guides the Skie, And after death possesse a place aboue the heauens hie. But he that shewes his wit to late, his wisdome shewes in vayne. Let euery man seeke God to please, and worldly wealth disdayne, And trauayle, for the heauenly state of him example take, Which of this worldly fading ioyes a small accompt doth make, But only hopes in time to come the perfect ioyes to feale, Which wel he knowes, for God to hym such things doth oft reueale. And such a wiseman late there liued since I remember may, That with a fewe vpon the top of hye Soractis lay, Full leane he was, and bearded wel, his house was smal and neate, All clad he was in russet robes, a man of learning great. And comely countnance to beholde. he had his dwelling place In wildernesse, where round about the woods did him embrace: Whose heauenly mind, when as he lyst of things to come could tel, And aunswers gaue, such as for truth did Delphis not excel. I moued and prouoked thus with fame that of him ran, By paynfull iourneys long vnto this sacred hill I came, And fo?d the olde man sitting there in warme and Sunny caue. Who (after that I had receiude the like God Deane I gaue) He wyllde me there to take my rest so downe by him I syt. And therewithall I askde him thus: what is the cause of it (Quoth I) that here you choose to lyue vpon this mountaine steepe, Where almost euery thing doth lack, that life of man should kepe. Then aunswering me this holy man on this sorte there began: My great delight was heretofore to liue in cities, whan Both yong, and ignoraunt, I thought nought else to be requirde But riches here, and such delight as life of man desirde, Following y? example and the fault of rude and common sort: Then ioyed I for to leade my life wyth great and much resort, And with the rest for company I fell into the floud Of vayne delightes, with colour false, deceyude of trouth and good. But when that greater age began wyth fading yeares to show, And wisedome more in tract of time within my head to growe, I then began to note and marke the partes that men do play, And sundry sorte of liues they leade. (as God gaue grace) to way. Then many fylthy things I sawe there done, and ful of shame, And nothing else of iustice left but vayne and ydle name. Th' vngilty to be punnished, the gylty scaping free, The vertue hydde in vice, and vice in vertue hid to be, The poore in euery place opprest, and fauour more to get Than iust deserts, y? law a brybing craft for golde a fyshing nette: Eche kinde of handy craft corrupt by guile of workmens wyll, The theefe to fee the Inkeper his gests thereby to kyll. Besydes I many might beholde enricht by theft and guyle Though naughty beastes, more meeter far, to weare a rope a whyle, Yet praysde to be and worshipped, and feared very much: The vnworthy placde in regal seate, and honours dealt to such As haue but only shape of men. Besyde religion fled By couetousnesse, and Priests bent al to foode, and Harlots bed: And vnder cloke of holinesse seke priuily to gayne, And pick the common peoples purse by meanes of wyly trayne: While as they open heauen wyde, and barre the hellish way, And while they bost that they can soules where as they list conuay, And wyth their Portas force the saincts to do as they are bent. By this occasion left I al, and from the townes I went, Accoumpting it more safe for me to liue in desert place, And in this hyll to runne the rest of al my ranging race. This hil whereas the altare stands of Syluester the saint, Where as the Shrine, and monuments of him his prayses paynt: Which place though it seme rough and rude, not meete to dwel vpon Yet fitte it is for saincts, and such as liue in peace alone, And wholly do apply their mindes the Lord to feare and loue, And alwayes seeke to ioyne themselues with saincts in Skies aboue: But hard perchaunce it seemes to thee, and straunge it doth appere, That I can liue in desert suth, and stony places here, Where seldome any man doth come, where wanting seemes to be Most things that should sustaine the life of man at libertie. Yet is it not so hard in deede, nor straunge it seemeth than, If that the holy Ghost enspire the heart of any man, Descending downe from heauens hye: of God the sacred sprighte That purifies the heart from sinne, and rayseth soules to light That ouerwhelmde in flesh do lye: as Mercury sublimde By force of fyer is, and takes a colour white ful finde. This holy sprite adournes the minde, and heart doth vpward moue This cutts away the worldly cares, and breadeth heauenly loue: Wherwith the minde inflamed once all things doth easye seeme, Though neuer so sore: for he that loues doth labour light esteeme, Especially if any hope there be rewarde to holde: For hope, &amp; loue, are two str?g pricks, that makes vs alway bolde, And not to care for any toyle, wherfore continually Our daily prayers must wee make, to hym that guides the skye, That so thys holy sprite vouchsafe into our heartes to fall, That he may plant a Godly hope, and Godly loue withall: Wherwith y? minde inspirde may mo?t aboue the starry skye, Despising much the world, and ioyes that vaine doe please the eye, And striue to ioyne it selfe to God, with all the force and might, No maruell then it is all, if ayded of this sprite I here can dwell, and leade a lyfe full harde so paciently, Upon this stiepe and desert rocke, and stony mountaine hye. Yet neuer lackt I meate, nor clothes vpon this loftye spyre, As much as nature doth content, not wanton fonde desyre. A little thing doth nature serue, a small thing doth content, Such one as loues none ouerplus, a man to vertue bent, That rather seekes celestiall lyfe, than fleshly fading dayes. For lyfe (least thou be ignorant) is double, in hir wayes: One, wherwithall the bodye lyues, still followed and pursude Is thys, of all the route of fooles, and common people rude. The people fonde that nothing knowe of any worthinesse, But slouthful beasts do make their God of filthy fonde excesse. This lyfe is proper vnto beastes of wilde and sauage kinde, The other vnto God aboue, and men of godly minde, That for their great and worthy deedes doe well deserue the name Of perfect men, and holly sainctes of euerlasting fame. But such hye minded vertuous Impes the earth doth seldome broode, The earth a mother to the naught, and stepdame to the good. Agui se falta vn Renglon por ligereza. But now bicause I see thee bent to giue attentiue eare, Some things of this celestiall lyfe I will declare thee here, which ought well vnderstoode, to please the minde of any wight. Fyrst, man consystes not only of fleshe, but also of the spright: This giueth lyfe to them that liue, by this we feele and moue, This giues vs mind, y? worthyest thing by which men wondrous proue. But many doubt if that the soule doe liue the body dead, Or whether it doe finishe to when as the lyfe is fledde: Assuredly the worser sort that to the fleshe doe cleaue, And bent to vice, despising God, doe wishe and eke beleue, The soule to haue a dying day: bicause (alas) they feare The cruell torments for the sinnes that they committed here: And therefore will alowe no hell, nor Diuels for to be, And so they doe persuade themselues to scape with mischiefe free. An other better sort of men that synfull lyfe doe hate, Prouoked with the Godly loue of vertues goodly state, Doe thinke the soule doth alwayes lyue, and not to dye with graue, Bicause they hope a glorious Crowne for their good workes to haue, And make accompt of perfect blisse when death hath shot hys dart, And of a better promisde lyfe for to enioy their part. Of these two sortes who iudgeth best? who is but the iust? For euermore in doubtfull things the opinion must we trust That pleaseth best the better sort, and that which follow most Such men as vertuous be, and such as haue the holy Ghost. More safe it is to cleaue vnto the vertuous, and the iust, Than fansyes of the wycked men to credite or to trust. Ne must we note their number great that any thing haue sayde, But in what sort they leade theyr lyfe must well of vs be wayde. Wherefore it better is with fewe of vertuous sort to say, That soules doe lyue continually and haue no dying day, Than with a number of the lewde against it to replye, Contending that there are no sprites, and that the soule doth dye. But more bicause thou shalt beleue, I will declare to thee By reason good, the state of soule immortall for to bee. For if that God in better things doth cunning still expresse, As wysedome telles, and as the good and vertuous must confesse: Then doubtlesse must we iudge he gaue the soules no time to dye, Since better farre it is for them to liue continuallye, Than with the fleshe to be extinct, and feele a full decaye: Which thus I proue, if death doe take from vs the soule away, If that we haue no other lyfe, but in thys body here, Then God may be accounted ill, and shall vniust appere, For thousandes euery day we see that florishe prosprouslye, In richesse, substance and renoume, in raignes and Empyres hye, Yet ydle lubbers, vnlearnde, &amp; naught, that synne at libertye, And runne the race of all their life in great prosperitye. On the other syde we may beholde the iust opprest to be With spitefull chaunce, a wretched lyfe and pytious prouertye. Thus eyther God vnrighteous is that doth these things permit, Or after death hath euery man as he deserueth it: Or else he doth disdaine the deedes of mortall men to knowe. Besides, what gratious mind apperes in God what goodnesse doth he showe? If this be all that he doth giue, a lyfe so short, and vaine, That swyftly runneth to an ende, and doth no time remaine: The halfe wherof is spent in sleepe, the rest in griefe, and toyle, And daungers great as fast doth fleete, as riuers swyft in soyle. Therfore go to, O wretched men, builde Gorgeous Churches hye, And let with costly offrings great your altars pestred lye, Set vp your ioyfull branche of bayes, your sacred dores about, with pompe of proude processyon passe, let Himnes be ratled out, Spende frankconsence, and let the nose of God be stretched wyde With pleasant smoke: do this, and adde more honour much besyde, That he preserue your goodly lyfe, wherin doth you torment, Sometime great cold, &amp; sometime heat, now plague, now famishement Now bloudy warres, now sicknes great or chaunce to sorowe at, Sometime the busye byting flye, sometime the stynging Gnat, The Chynch and Flea. Reioyce I saye that here you leade your lyfe With thousand painfull labours great, in trauaile, toyle, and stryfe: And after in a little space in paine you drop away, And lompishe lye in lothsome vawlt, to wormes a grateful praye. O worthy lyfe, O goodly gift of God: man in this world is bredde Among the brutishe beastes, and fooles and knaues hys lyfe is ledde, Wher stormes, and flakey snowes &amp; yse and durt and dust, and night, And harmful ayre, and cloudes &amp; mistes and windes, wyth hellish syght, And grief &amp; wailing raynes, wher death besyde doth worke his feate. Is this our goodly countrey here, is this our happy seate, For which we owe such seruice here, vnto the Goddes aboue? For which it seemeth mete wyth vowes the heauenly sayncts to moue? And if none other life we haue than this of body vayne, So frayle and ful of fylthinesse, when death hath carcasse stayne: I see not why such prayses should of God resound in ayre, Nor why we should such honour giue to hym in temples fayre, That hath vs wretches framed here in this so wretched soyle, That shall for euermore decay after so great a toyle. Wherfore least God shall seeme vniust, and ful of cruelnesse Shal well deseruing counted be: we must of force confesse, That death doth not destroy the soule, but that it alwayes is: None otherwise than sprite in ayre, and sainct in heauen liues, Both voyd of body, sleepe, and meate. And more we must confesse That after death they liue in paynes, or perfect blessednesse. But let this reason thee suffise, for if thou this do shewe Unto the wicked kinde, they laugh, no light the blinde doth knowe. But thou, beleue for euermore and know assuredly, (For ground of sauing health it is,) that soule doth neuer dye, Exempted from the Sisters power and fatal destiny. These things foretolde made euident let vs begin to tell The perfect life, that makes vs like to saincts aboue that dwell: By which the heauens we desyre. But syth doth best appeare Contrary things, when they be seene, and ioyned something neere. Wherfore it is conuenient first the bodies life to showe, That drawes vs downe fr? heauen hie, to minde the earth below, And makes vs like to brutish beastes, contrary to the soule. This life he liues (though naught) y? doth for stately honours prowle, And seekes with al his force the fruicte of praise and glory vayne, Desiring only men to please with fonde vayne glorious brayne: And he that wholly doth apply himself a wealth to get By right or wrong, and hath his heart vpon his riches set: A two leggde Mole, that alwayes doth in earth entombed lye, Not casting once his eyes aloft vnto the heauens hye. And he that drownde in lecherie, and surfets euer lyes, Regarding only fleshly ioyes, doth shamefastnesse despise, Runnes headlong into whoredome vile, and fattes himselfe with meate, A foolish man, that so the wormes may haue more foode to eate. Al these same vile and fylthy kindes that I haue reckned here, May wel be called fleshly men, for loue to flesh they beare: Whose life doth differ smal fr? beastes. But now on the other side: He that doth prayse of men depise, and pomp of worldly pride, Doth liue with chast and Godly minde, is calde a spiritual man: Bicause his sprite the body rulde, and lust subdued than, Doth freely guide and hath his place in hiest part of brayne. Therefore the Godly life, is fyrst with bridle to restrayne Fond pleasure, Gluttony, and lust, to conquer flesh with sprite, For to neglect al worldly things, and only set delight On heauen, heauen most to wysh, and chiefly to regard: There is the soyle for soules and seate for vertuous men preparde: There to the body layd in graue the righteous soules do clime, Most glorious soules that brightly doe with glorious vertue shine, And feele in euerlasting light an euerlasting ioy. But chiefly let the vertuous man his time and toyle employ In learning, vsing styll to reade such bokes as do entreate Of God, of soule, and wretched state, of this our dwelling seate, Of death, or other honest things, and let him night and day, Of these both often reade, and talke, and wel in minde them way. But wanton workes, &amp; wanton words, let him with head eschew, Alas how sore do such affayres a vertuous minde subdew: For reading is the foode of minde, which if it vertuous be Doth profyt much, if it be yll doth hurt excedinglye: None otherwise than euyll meate doth hurt the man that chawes. These thinges though they muste all be kept. yet nothing more withdrawes A man from loue of filthy flesh, nor leades to God more nye, Than oftentimes to ponder well of life the misery: Which since it is so short, and full of such calamitie, Seemes rather death than life to me, yea, worse than death to be. For who is it that doth not see, who doth not playne perceaue? That yrksome gall, and bytternesse to euery parte do cleaue. If euery thing thou wel doest sift, nought perfect shalt thou fynde: For nature poysoned hath the partes of all and euery kind. Most things haue double face: ful black within, and outward white, And with their colour, do deceyue the iudgement of the sighte. If ought there be here in this life both fayre and good besyde, Like smoke and mist it flyes away, and doth no time abide. Time suffers nothing long on earth, death maketh al things vayne, And turnes and tumbles vnder foote, of man the proud disdayne. Alas how al this worldly pompe doth quickly passe away, How wauering is renoume of man, how sone doth it decay: Much like the bubble swelling great amyd the waters cleere Is sone destroyed, and with a puffe of winde doth not appere. For in a moment al the ioyes of man are fetcht away, Then only doth the talk remaine, wherein they thus do say, Loe, here he was, loe, this did he, he fought, and triumph wan, He loued, he raigned, he conquerd realmes, subdued many a man, A goodly sorte of bookes he wrote, but now where shall we finde These things? no where. Himself where now? both out of sight and minde. What is he now? Nothing. Or whether did he himself conuay? Loe, fled from hence with windes he is, and vanisht quite away. Alas, alas, but trifles fond, and fansies meere they be, Whatsoeuer goodly thing on earth, or wonderful we see. What tell you me of Was, or Did, one Is more worth coumpt I, Than Was a thousand times. But fast this Is away doth flye, And al our pompe with him he beares. These things who wel doth way, And vseth to consider oft, shall quickly cast away This worldly loue, and hating earth shal seeke the Skies to finde: Especially if therewithal he vse to beare in minde How fylthy and how miserable, mans body doth appere, Of fading flesh, and brittle bones, with skinne encompast here: Al flowing ful with dregges vncleane, and bloud corrupt, and vile, Still durty, foule, and filthy lookes, except it euery while Be washt, and kept with daily care, and so made fayre and white. O dolefull hospitall of minde, and vessell of the sprite, By which such sycknesse great we feele, by which such neede we haue. O heauie garment, pryson strong, O quick, and liuely graue: That chokest here both minde, &amp; sense, and them in darkenesse hyde: Wherby so great an ignorance in brest of man doth byde. O earth to earth returning soone, that in a smallest while In tombe, shalt freshly feede y? wormes, with foode, of carcasse vile, In what a wretched case liues he, that ledde away with loue Of thee, doth leaue the perfect lyfe, and gift of God aboue, While more than meate esteming thee, thy pleasures here preparde, He onely seekes: and good, and ryght but smally doth regarde: And thinkes there is no other lyfe than this, that here we holde. A foolishe Asse, forgetfull of himselfe, and countrey olde, From whence into thys darksome dale, and dolefull place he went, That so a wretche he should become, in wretched carcasse pent. For euery soule that is enclosde with fleshe and members here, Hath wretched lyfe, tyll losed fr? thence it flye to heauens clere: Except the heauy waight of synne doe barre him of hys way, And cause it in the lowest ayre, or on the earth to stay. For purest heauen neuer can a thing vncleane abyde, Nor wicked men, nor doltishe fooles, may come where God doth guide. These wordes while as the holy man in teaching mee had spent, The Sunne almost had ended daye with Waine that weary went: And night was nere at hande, that thoe began abrode to cast Hir dreadfull darksome shade, vpon the worlde approching fast. I thence depart, and towards Rome my way in hast I take. And whyle with speede I passe the pathe that iorney new doth make: Lo Cynthia shining compasse full, did call the lightlesse night, With syluer beames, that dewe she cast to appere both fayre and bright. Thus went I all alone, and wyth my selfe in minde I wayde, The Godly wordes that late to me the auncient Father sayde. But lo, thre men in company therwith I might beholde, whom meeting thus by cha?ce, I askde which way they trauaile would: To Rome they sayde: and one of them lookde full vpon mee thoe, And naming mee, from wh?ce quoth he, what countrey comste thou froe? I aunswerde him, from that wyse man, which in the part most hye Of fayre Apolloes stately hyll, in lofty place doth lye. Wherewith he smylde, &amp; sayde, O foole synkes it into thy minde, That possyble on earth it is a wyse man here to finde? He semeth wyse that is least foole the other sort among, Although a dolt for wysedome doth to Gods alone belong: Of number which we here are three, for I am calde by name Sarracilus, and Sathiell he, Iaxa is thys same. which though we walk in humain shape, thus seeming men in face, Yet Gods we be, and nere the Moone we haue our dwelling place. Whereas a number great of Gods of meanest sort doe lye, That haue the guiding of the earth, and Seas that ryse so hye. This when I heard, amasde I was, and sore to dread began: Yet seming bolde, and voide of feare, full lyke a pretye mann I askde wherfore they went to Rome, then aunswerde me the same: A fellowe there of oures we haue that Ammon hath to name, whom bounde to serue by Magike Arte a yong man there kepes straight, Of Narni soyle, that doth in court of Vrsin prelate wayght. O what great power is graunted man, the sprites he guides by line. By this you well may vnderstande your soules to be diuine, And voide of death. For if no part, of you should after raine, If that your soule should dye, as bo- dye here by death is slaine: What power shoulde haue such foolishe beastes, and trifling pyctures vaine, Upon the sprites aboue? And if no sacred thing remaine In you, how should such Ghostes as we the force of man so waye, Or vnto man of fading state in such a sort obaye? Yea I my selfe was once Constrainde to serue a German wight, Enclosde within a compast stone of Christall clere and bright: But at the length a bearded syre vnlosde me of these bandes, And prison broken thence I fledde, in hast from out his handes. To Rome therefore we go with minde, if that we may t'vntye From seruice straight, a mate of oures that there doth captiue lye. And so that downe, to Hell we may conuaye this present night, A sort of Romishe prelates proude, that liue in great delight. These words whyle as he spake, a winde forthwith dyd pittling blowe: Quoth Sathiell then, O frendes, fr? Rome Remisses comes I knowe: This winde that comes before declares, nor herein did he lye, For therwithall a fayre yong man Remisses stoode them bye. They at hys comming all reioist, and byd hym welcome there, And aske what great affayres in Rome, what newes doe there appere. There all quoth he are bent to lust, and Glotony doe minde, With theft, and guile, all ours they be, both man, and womankinde. But Clement there the Pope prepares an armye great in hast, And seekes to haue the present state of Luther cleane defacde, And Spanishe ensynes therfore kepes: nor wyll he nowe dispute, And him wyth scriptures ouerthrowe, but with the sworde confute. Away with counsaile now, and hence with Luthers workes againe, For Byshops now are battailes meete, all other wayes are vaine, Ne care they what the Apostles taught, ne for the wordes of Christ, But boast themselues as Lordes of all, that may doe what they list. They that haue power do feare no law, law is with force opprest. But we (my mates) doe hope thereby of gayne to be possest, And of the spoyle of such a sort some soules to beare away Unto the dreadfull dongeon darke. These wordes he thus did say: Th? whispring something w? th?selues, from thence they doe depart: And mee they leaue remaining there alone, with heauy heart. For when Sarracilus had sayde that none on earth was wyse, Immediatly a dolefull thought wythin my heart did ryse: And thus vnto my selfe I sayde, is wysedome euermore In vaine of vs desyrde, and praisde, and vainely looked for. And only delt to saintes aboue? Then of necessitie Here in this wretched mortall lyfe, all men must foolishe be, And laughing stocks, &amp; pageants fonde, vnto the Gods in skye. O state in most vnhappy kinde of man in misery, O rashe vnbridled wantonnesse of such as parents bee, O filthy lust that doth beget the Children that we see, What do you now? you doe beget both fooles, and wretches here, A boy is borne, be mery syrs, reioyce, and make good chere, Fil in your cuppes, and daynty dish vpon the table place. But sone the childe shal proue a foole, or liue in wretched case, Or dying sone, he shal departe vnto the Ghost belowe. O blinded mindes, that of the things to come do neuer know. We mortal men in wretched things haue oft a great delight. These words I muttred in my minde, and wrapt in woful plight I went vnto my lodging strayght, for sleepe opprest my eyes, And made me reele. Of wisemans state these wordes shal here suffise. Now meete it is thy weried harpe my Muse at rest to lay, And for to spare the iarring strings, let vs this time go pray The Lord and maker of the world, that grace he may vs send, The other sygnes that do remayne, wyth pleasant song to end, For greater things I must declare than yet from me did flowe: And sore my simple minde doth feare, such Mysteries great to showe. My watry signe shal search the partes of nature perfectly, And last of al my labour shal set open wyde the Skye. Aquarius, the eleuenth Booke. The Loue of nature parent chief and great desire of minde, The secret causes of al things for to reueale and finde Persuades me now agayne, my selfe with Aeon streames to fyl, And once agayne to rest on toppes of hye Parnasus hil. My Muse draw neere, &amp; bring thy Harp, now neede thy wit to showe It is, and of a learned voyce, and verse at ful to flowe. No smal things here we must declare I purpose now in minde, Dame natures face for to disclose, about the world to winde. And fyrst what hath bene here before, what is, and what shal be, Is called Eus: this name contaynes al things of eche degree, But of the sortes that God hath framde by power and wisdome hye, Some leade their life of body voyd, some eyther liuelesse lye, Or else do liue in body here. Of former state of twayne This Boke speaks not, y? next shal shew in time that doth remayne: Now (Muse) let vs the other shew. The farthest partes most high Of al the world, wyth ample space encompast is of Skie, That whirling round with dayly course doth al things here enclose. Fiue Zones deuide it into partes, but euery part of those Replenisht with his dwellers is, nothing forbyds the same. For colde can neuer hurt the Gods, nor heate can them inflame. Such things do best agree wyth earthe, the sacred Skies are free From colde congeled, quiuering yse, and fiers that flaming be. Which though it rolle continually. yet kepes it styl one place, And from the parte where first it stode, doth neuer shift his pace. For placde betwene two fixed Poles, it stedfastly doth stand, And is sustaynde betwene them two by Gods almighty hand. Whereof the one doth playne appeare to vs continually, And doth beholde the Beares aboue that kepe their course so hye: The other vnder earth is placde agaynst it fixed wel, And in the night is sene to them. that vnder vs do dwel. This compast globe of al the Skie, from East to West deuides As many Spheres in compasse round, as there are Zones besydes. That which is next vnto the Beare The Articke hath to name: And next to him the Circle stands wherein doth Cancer flame, Which doth constraine the S?ne to fal, and backward to retire, And farther of for to withdrawe his beames of flaming fire. Then next in order doth ensewe, the Equinoctiall line, Which doth declare the dayes, &amp; nights, of equal length and tyme. Not far from thence by Capricorne, another line doth runne, Which cannot passe, but doth retourne from hence to vs the Sunne. The circle next that placed is vnto the South so nere Th' Autarticke circle hath to name, contrary to our Sphere. Beside these lines a circle crookt there stands in Skies so cleare, By which y? S?ne in months twice syx, doth passe a perfect yeare. An other circle white there is, whose course by knees doth trayne Of Gemini, by Scorpius taile, and by the Tropicks twayne, And through the croked path of Sunne by midst of Archers string, And passeth by the Centaurs legges, and by the Egles wing, And both the Carter and the Swanne, and Perseus doth it touch. And Paralels there are, this name giue Greekes to Circles such, And day by day the Sunne doth passe a circle of this kinde, When as he falles amyd the West, and leaues the East behinde. Two Colures eke besydes there are, the one where Sunne doth stay By Cancer, Capricorne, and both the Poles doth cut his way: The other by the Balance runnes, and by the Wethers face: This shewes the times wh? night &amp; day are both of equal space. Besydes a numbre great there is of sundry circles framde, That passe by both the foresayd Poles, Meridians rightly namde, That ouer vs directly runnes, a Circle more doth lye The Horizon calde, the world in mydst deuided is thereby, And wher our sight doth ceasse it stands thence terme the Greekes it so. Besydes the Heauens parted are with many Circles moe. And nine there be, whereof the hyest that mouer first we call, Doth rolling from the farthest Indes, with Moores and Spaniards fall: Within a day he runnes his race, and fiercely doth he twine About with him the other Spheres, in whome no Starre doth shine: But cleane contrary to the same moue al the Spheres besyde, And towards y? streames of Ganges great from Cales in course they slyde. Wherof the greatst doth shine w? starrs that voyd of number be, And scarcely in an hundred yeares doth moue but one degree. And next to this doth Saturne stande aboue the other Spheres, Who finisheth his course at full in space of thirty yeres. And next to him stands Iupiter, that ende of course doth gayne In yeares twice syx. Him Mars ensewes that turns in tweluemonths twayne. Next stands the Sunne that (as they say) his iourney doth contriue Besyde six houres in space of dayes three hundred, sixty, fiue. Then next in place doth Venus rolle hir whyrling whele about, And soner than the Sunne hir course by seuentene dayes falles out. Then moues in Circle Mercury, which if report be right, Doth nine dayes soner end his course than Venus planet bright. The Circle of the Moone is lowest, and passeth through the line Of all hir course in houres eyght, and twenty dayes and nine. Seuen planets thus there are, y? grekes as wandring starres do call: The hyest of which Saturnus hath, to him for house and hall. The Gote and seruitour of Ioue, and Iupiter doth holde: To houses darke amidde the skye the fishe and Archer bolde. The Scorpion and the Phrygean Ramme, to foolishe Mars pertayne: And in the flaming Lyon fierce, the Sunne doth East remaine. But in the Bull and Ballance doth the tender Venus rest: Mercurius doth in twinnes reioice, and in the Virgins brest. A goodly Rome the Crabbe doth make, wherein the Moone doth dwell. But of the fayre Celestiall sygnes, let vs begin to tell. Within the Zodiake, where the Sunne a yere by course doth trye: Twelue Signes there be, &amp; syx of them, are named Northerlye. The other syxe are Southerne sygnes, from beast that gilded shines: Unto the pleasant Uirgins foote, they are calde the Northerne signes. But from the foremost of the waytes, vnto the cattayle twaine Of Neptunes droue, whatsoeuer are vnto the South pertaine. The names of these celestiall sygnes I wyll disclose in verse. These are the Ram, the Bull, the Twinnes the Crabbe, the Lyon fierce, The Maide, the Scales, the Scorpion, the Shooter, and the Gote, The Waterpourer, and in skyes, the Fishes, two that flote. Ech seuenth stande contrarily, for when the one doth ryse The other syttes, when as the Ram apperes before our eyes, Then down therwith descendes y? Scales, so standes contrary full: And risyng eche when other falles the Scorpion, and the Bull. From head of Crabbe, to Shooters foote directly doe they lye: And from the Gote vnto the Twinnts they are sayde to hang awry. Thrise ten degrees in length, &amp; twelue in bredth hath euery signe: And earthly named are, the Gote, the Bull, and Virgin fyne. But airy are these three, the Scales, the Waterman, the Twinnes: And waterishe are the Scorpion, and the Crabbe, and fishy finnes. The three that rest are fiery the Lyon, Shooter, Ram: And Masculin be these with three, that Ayrie sygnes we name. And Fortunate they called be, the rest are Fæminine: And are vnfortunate, they say that state of Starres define. These mouing are, the Ram, the Crabbe, the Scales, and Capricorn, And fast the Lyon, Scorpion, Bull, and Boye with Egle borne. The Twinnes, the Shooter, Mayde, and Fishe, are common euery sygne. More, three and thyrtie Images in sacred skyes doe shine, Whereof are twenty placed fast, amidde the Northerne Raine: And storming South doth challenge all the rest that doe remaine. These are the starres that in the North doe giue their blasing light: Two Beares, of which doth Helice shine forth with Starres more bright. The lesser Cynosura is, Phæniceans faithfull guide: Betweene them both the Serpent fierce, doth creepe with crawling pride, There Cepheus shines, and Cassiopey, and Candian glistring Crowne: And next vnto the milke white Swanne is placde the Kneeler downe, And harkneth to the pleasant Harpe. The Berwarde there doth showe His glistring starres, and Perseus stands in thys celestiall rowe: That beares in hande Medusaes face, and in this part is seene, The Carter, he that Serpent holdes, and eke hys Serpent keene, And by the Serpent standes the Shaft, and there the Egle nye, And Dolphin that in ayrie seas aboue doth swiftly flye. Here shines the noble Pegasus, a Horse of auncient fame: And thereby standes Andromeda, and Delta, last of name. Now thirtene sygnes the South in part contrary doth retaine: The Whale, that scarce is yet at length wyth sworde of Perseus slaine. Orion armde thou shalt beholde in thys same part of skyes. There Nilus runnes w? Channels store: and Hare that swiftly flyes, Whom nere a brace of Doggs pursue, the greater and the small. Among these Starres doth Argos sayle a goodly Ship, and tall. Here mayst thou both the Altar, and the myghty Cup beholde. And Phœbus Crowe, that glisters all wyth Starres of flaming golde. The Centaure fierce, and Dragon slaine, with strong Alcides sweat, The stinking plague of Lernaes lake a griesly monster great. And in thys part a certaine Fishe, may well perceiued bee. Lo here the shapes that moue aboue my verse hath tolde to thee. Now wyll I shewe how many Starres in euery sygne appere: In Elice doe seuen shine, by name the greater Beare, Bicause it giues the greater lyght but Cynosura hyght: The lesser beare bicause she doth appere with smaller light, Though one and twenty Starres in hir doe euermore abide: Fyftene the waking Serpent hath that doth the Bears deuide: And Cepheus .xix. starres containes: Cassiepey doth shine with thirtene lights: y? gorgeous crown hath neuer more than nine: And three the Swanne, twice fiue and nine the Kneeler bright doth weare: And fourtene Starres describes the m? that driues about the Beare, Of which the starre doth brightest shine that in hys gyrdle lyes: Ful seuentene brondes doth Perseus holde that glisters in the skyes: The Carter seuen: but that clere Starre that on hys shoulder standes Is calde the Gote, the other twaine are Kiddes he hath in handes: A dreadfull syght to shypmen oft. The man that holdes the Snake Hath seu?tene starres: his Serpents shape doth two and twenty make. Nine lyghtes doe shine in Orpheus Harp: foure frames the Shaft a hye: Foure fyres doe flame in him that lyfte the Troian to the skye: Ten sparkes doe make the Dolphin clere: with eightene Starres of night Shines Pægasus: and twenty giues Andromeda hir lyght: But three alone doth Delta beare. Now will I take in hande To tell in verse how many starres in sygne of Zodiake stande. The Ram is fyrst, that .xviij. lightes doth in his body beare, The Bull hath one and twenty starres but seuen shining cleare, Behinde hys back Vergiliæ are calde and eke Athlantides, As many in his head he hath, of showers calde Hyades: Eightene betwixt them haue y? Twinnes, one .x. the other eyght: And eightene hath the Crabbe aboue, two standes behinde him straight That Asses, and the Stall are namde, but next that clerely shine, The Lyon glisters there with starres in number ten and nine: The Virgin holding eares of Corne with eyghtene lightes is clere: In Balance foure, and .xv. in the Scorpion doth appere: And .xv. in the Shooter shines, before whose feete doth lye A certaine Crowne where seuen lightes doe glister to the eye. The Gote hath two and twenty starres, the Troian Boy fourtene: In the one Fishe viii. and .ix. appeares: in the other .xii. are seene. Now will I shew what starres there be in sygnes of Southerne syde, Though farre from vs they be, &amp; scant can of our syght be spyde: The monstrous Fyshe hath .xxx. lights: like sort in Nilus flowes, Syxe hath the Hare, and .xvij. in great Orion showes, With .xix. flames the Syrian Dog, the lyttle Dog hath three, The sydes of Arcos brauely deckt with three and twenty be, One starre doth Chiron more relay, the sacrifice in hands He holdes eleuen hath, &amp; deckt with .iiij. the goodly Altare stands, With six and twenty Hydra shynes, three signes that lies in length And mates the Crab, the Virgin fayre and Lion great of strength. The Rauen shynes wyth seauen starres, the Cup hath eyght in sight, The Southerne Fish with .xij. doth cast abrode his starry light, The rising and the setting of the Signes let vs display. Three sorts of wayes y? starres do ryse, three sortes they fall away, That rising called Cosmike is, the setting termde likewise, When early in the Easte the signe, wyth Sunne is knowen to ryse: But when soeuer any sygne doth ryse, or downeward fall, And Sunne is setting, lets them shine, this terme we Cronicall: And Heliake is the rising namde, when as the Sunne full nere The signe lyes hyd, and passing thence, forthwith doth bright appere: The Heliake setting that we cal when as in any signe The Sunne doth walke, and w? his light permit it not to shine. But now the rising of the Signes and how they downe descend I wyll declare, if Muses ayde and Phœbus be my frend. When Ram doth rise then mounteth vp left part of Andromæd Unto the halfe, and ioynde therewith Sir Perseus flaming head: Then backward commes the Bull aloft, who while he vpward hyes, Al Perseus springs, and greatest part of Carter then doth rise, And Thurlpoles tayle, and fading quite the altare downe doth fall: Then hydes himself in flashing floudes, the Berward first of all. With Twinnes doth all the Whale aryse, and former partes of Po, And with this same Orion great all armed vp doth go: Then he that holdes the Snake with both his feete, the water tries: The Crab arising vp takes halfe the Crowne away from eyes, The tayle of Whale, the Southerne Fyshe and head of Kneeler lowe, And half his Hanch: fr? knees to backe of him that Snake doth showe, And all his Snake except the neck, the Bearward almost quite. But now agayne from girdle vp Orion commes to sight, Wyth al the course of Nilus great. These Signes besyde do ryse Wyth Lion fierce: the Egle, Hare, and Dog of lesser syse, The former legges of greater Dog, and head of Hydra springs: But these agaynst the Bearward hote, and he that Serpent wrings, With head and necke of Snake in hand, and part that did remayne Of glistring Crowne, and Kneeler eke, (excepted yet agayne His left foote and his knee besyde) in Westerne waues do fall, With Virgin riseth whole the Dog, and Serpent vp doth crall, Unto the Cups, and then appeares the Ship of Thessaly, As much as Mast and sayle may showe, Contrary hid do lye These starres, the Dolphin, al the Swan, his tayle except, the Darte, The Scorpions cley, and of the floude of Nile the former parte: But Pegasus hides head and necke, the rest appeareth bright, Al Argo with the Scales doth ryse, and Bearward clere in sight. Saue tippe of tayle, al Hydra seene, the right knee and the shinne Of Kneeler downe, and Centaures tayle to shine doth then beginne: Then mayst y? halfe the Crowne perceyue the rest of Horse that flies, And partes that hindermost do stand of Swanne then hidden lies: And al saue head the Whale doth set, hir head in Seas doth hyde: Andromæda then shalt thou see, olde Cepheus downe to slyde, The Father of Andromeda, and downe in flouds to fall With hands, his shoulders, &amp; his head. These shapes and fygures all With Scorpion rise: the Dragons tayle, and Chirons horse appeare, And rest of Crowne and Sacrifice that he in hands doth beare, Also the Serpents head doth ryse, and eke hir holders head, Then syts the part that doth remayne of corse of Andromed, And Cepheus syts from head to waste, and double winding way Of Padus streames, and downward then doth fal dame Cassiepey, Then first the Dog himselfe doth hyde, and downe Orion flings. When as the Shooter vp doth ryse, the Serpent holder springs, With Serpent whole, the left hand and the head of Kneeler downe, And al the Harp, the breast and head of him that ware the Crowne Of Aethyops land King Cepheus cald. Then hidden quite doth lye Orion, Hare, and greater Dog and Carter of the Skye, Excepting only Head and Feete then Perseus downe doth fall, His right foote and his thigh except the Ship (saue sterne) syts al. When as the Gote ascendeth vp, the Swanne, and Shaft thereby The Altare and the Egle fayre. begin to appeare in skye. But sterne of Argo then descendes, and lesser Dog doth hyde His starres in Sea, and vnder grounde therewyth doth Perseus slyde. When as of Ganimedes fayre the goodly starres do ryse, Then first the limmes of Pegasus do clime into the Skies: Contrarywyse the neck and head of Dragon downe doth slyde, And Chiron doth his hinder parte beneath the waters hyde. When as the Fyshes twayne are brought to rise aloft in Skye, The right syde of Andromeda appeareth to the eye. And he that Southerne Fish is calde: then both the bodies quite Of Dragon and of Centaure great, are taken from our sight. Thus much of rising of the Signes and setting shal suffise, Now let vs touch the rest that doth remaine, in speedy wise. But fyrst we must Vrania call my verses here vnto, That she may ayde and succour sende such secrets to vndo. Vrania, thou that knowest the things aloft that hydden lye, That walkest oft by seates of Gods, and starry temples hye: Vrania beautiful draw nere, and open vnto me, The secrete seates of Gods aboue, and things that hidden be, And helpe thy Poet, that in song thy Scepters seekes to shewe, And graunt the whirling Skies aboue in minde that I may knowe. And first good Lady shewe to me if that the Skies aboue Consist of matter hard and thicke, or soft and apt to moue: None otherwise than is the ayre, which well we may deuide: This tolde thou shalt declare to me straunge matters more beside. Two springs of nature chiefe there be Materia and Forma namde: Of these same twaine al kinde of things, that here we see, are framde, Of these the earth, the Seas, the ayre, and flaming fyre springs. Wherefore they lye, that matter none admit in Heauenly things: For contraries should then in them be found, thus they do say, And by this meanes corrupted quite they should in time decay. But as me seemes, this reason here doth from the truth decline, For neyther matter is in fault, if that in tract of tyme The bodies fade: nor contraries themselues wil thus vndo If that their forces equall be, and stronger none of two: For when the strength &amp; power is lyke, then equall is the fyght, And victory on neither part, and neither syde doth lyght. Therfore God seking in hys minde the heauens hye to make, The chiefe and purest fyned partes, of matters, fyrst dyd take, And tempred them in such a sort that harme in them should cease, And that the things contrary thus, should styll remaine in peace: So lastes the skye continually and neuer doth decay. But for bicause the harder things last longer farre away, And take lesse hurt: therefore the skye of all the hardest seemes More than the Diamonde, that forme and fyre it light estemes, And euery force saue onely Gods, of whom it fyrst toke grounde. An other reason proues thys same, for fyrst that moueth rounde, The Spheres beneath him turns about and Westward them doth driue, And rolles them dayly mouing round though they contrary striue: Which could not be if that they were not hard assuredly. Take there withal that parte of Moone, the likest is to skye, Which Sun doth not behold, nor tuchd wyth beames of brothers eyes. So Starres at noone are thought to be in colour like to Skyes, Which Moone &amp; Starres th?selues be harde, and dark they also be: The experience of the Eclipse doth this declare apparantly, For Moone betwixt doth hide y? beames that from the Sunne do flowe, And suffers not the shining light vpon the earth to showe. Why shuld not this same hardnes here vnto the Skies agree? For neuer should it else holde fast the Starres that fixed be, But wander farre abroade they would, nor one place them should holde. Yet darke is not the firmament, as of the Starres we tolde, For placed here vpon the earth the hyest Starres we see: And well our sight descernes the signes that farthest from vs be. Syth hardest are celestiall shapes, and purest eke are such, Perchaunce they gyue a sound besides, and syth they rolle and touch, They make some heauenly melody, as some that long agoe Both learnde and sobre written haue, my Muse this doubt vndoe. Though hard and many be the kindes of Heauenly bodies hie, And though they subiect are to syght of earthly humaine eye, Yet noyse for troth they none do make, for nothing them doth beate: Nor beaten would they more resound that are most thicke and greate. And syth no ayre is there, wythout the which no sound is made, And therefore voyd of noyse runne they round in rolling trade. Besyde, the inferiour Circles eyght gaynward the mornings seate Are turnde about one selfe same way, nor on themselves they beate Wyth meeting course, but passe one way, wyth easy rolling round, As daunce in order compassing about do softely driue: The Mouer first agaynst them all in course doth onely striue, Yet noyse doth it neuer make, ne soundeth it at all, For aire there lackes and outward partes of Spheares are smoth alway: Whereby they swiftly passe about, no roughnesse them doth stay, And easly thus with gentle touch their neyghbours next are kyst, Wherfore there motion they do make all silently and whyst. Therefore the Fathers olde did erre, that earnestly beleued Spheares mouing to make Harmony, but not to be perceiued, Bycause it passde the eares of man, as is not heard at all The rush of Nilus streames, where from the mountaynes they doe fall, But farther of the sound doth roare. They trifle thus to teach, And fond and vayne the reason is, that herein they do preach. For if such things were neuer heard, why should they then deuise A sound amyd the Skies to be, tis naught to enterprise Of things to talke, that neuer can be shewde or proued playne, That iustly may denied be: no newe things must we fayne, Except a troth in them be proued, where reason is away, No fayth nor credit must we giue to wordes that men do say. But is the Heauen round my Muse, as fame of olde hath spyde, For compassed forme seemes perfecter. than all the rest besyde, Bycause it hath beginning none nor ende in it doth lye, Bycause it aye contayneth moste, more fine and fayre to th' eye And apter is it to be moued. chiefly the myddest about: As Heauen turnd about the earth, that hath hir standing stout In mydst of all the worlde. This forme so worthy doth agree To Heauen, to the Sunne and Moone, and all the Starres we see: Though folly fonde of Paynters doth them otherwyse descrye. But are the Starres as some do say the thicker parte of Skye? Not so: for euery one of them vnlike to Heauen be, Among themselves they differ eke, as Elme from Seruise tree, As Peare from Cherry differeth in fashion and in fruite: Their diners vertue this declares, and eke their sundry suite. A power alone hath euery Starre, and nature eke at hand. The Heauen therefore is but seate and place where Starres do stand, No substance thoe, or matter of them. What vertue hath the Skye? All force and vertues in the Starres and glistering planets lye. The starres do guide the c?passd world, and euery chaunge doth bring, The Starres create all things on earth and gouerne euery thing: Thus teach th' Astronomers, and thus the common fame doth flye. Ne must we think in thicke and thinne the substance of the Skye To differ from the Starres, but eke their natures diuers be. And sundry is their shape and force, and fashion that we see. The bygnesse of the Starres, and if their turning neuer stay, And in what place they fixed be, (as Plato once did say) And if they voyd of dwellers be, or any there doth dwell, My Muse I would be glad to knowe, wherefore I pray thee tell. All starres are not of bygnesse like, for many lesse there be, And in such sort, as comprehend no man may them we see: Some are agayne of larger syse, in number fewe and fyne, That in cleare nightes amyd the skyes wyth gorgeous light do shine: Of which th' Astronomers haue framde fayre shapes and fygures bright, And pictured haue the Heauens braue with sygnes of sundry sight. Thus of these greater sorte of Starres, (as learnd in Starres doe tel, And as the Sunnes eclipse doth shewe, wherein appeareth well How great the Moone in body is while vnder him she glydes, And darkning all with shadowes black, hir brothers beames she hydes,) Some do in compasse farre excede both seas, and earth, and all, And bygger are their shining globes though they do seeme so small: Bycause so farre from vs they be. For euery thing besyde, The farther it is from our eyes, the lesse in syght is spyed, And doth deceiue the lookers on. The starres that fixed be As Plato greatest clarke doth say, are eche in their degree About their Centers rolled round, and turnde continually, And by this reason are they thought to twinckle in the eye: And not as certayne fayned haue, bycause farre of they be, Therefore they yelde a trembling light to such as them do see: This reason surely is but vayne, and childishe for to write, For nothing seemes to twinckle tho, bycause tis farre from syght: But dimmer then and lesse it seemes, nor twinckling can they be Without a motion sure. Wherefore the Starres that fixt we see, Do moue togither with the Sunne, as we declared late, But Saturne, Iupiter and Mars, do moue in no such rate, No more doth Moone, nor Mercury, nor Venus pleasaunt Starre: But moue in little Circles that to them annexed are. Why sparckles not Saturne, and Ioue, and Mars, as doth the Sunne? Syth farther far from vs in Spheares aloft more hye they runne: Nor differ they in difference great from fixed Starres aboue? Bycause they do not as the Sunne about their Centers moue, But in these Epicycles rolle their bodyes rounde about. Some man perchaunce if so the Sunne doth sparckle, standes in doubt. But if he shall the same beholde when first it doth appeare, Or when in Winter time it falles, and settes in waters cleare, When as his eye may beste endure his syght thereon to cast, He shall perceyue it playne to turne, and eke to sparkle fast. Let no man thinke this thing to be so greate and strange to minde, If all the gorgeous Starres do moue in such a sorte and kinde: Seemes it not farre more wonderfull that Heauens compasse wide Wyth such a motion swift about the world doth alwayes glyde, That Byrdes and windes, &amp; lightnings flash, in swiftnesse it doth passe? Thus now th' almighty Lord, by whom the world created was, All things he made, deuided in these two, mouing and rest. But in the Center rest vpon the earth hir place possest: In all the others motion dwelles. The streames do swiftly flye, The ayre and fyry flames on earth do moue continually. But chiefly in the firmament hath mouing greatest spright, And euery Spheare the higher it is doth moue wyth greater might, And swiftlier runnes about the world. Wherefore that Heauen hie, That called is the mouer fyrst, with motion most doth flie. But that the greatest motion is, that in the time most small, Doth soonest runne his course about the greatest space of all. Thus would it runne about the worlde in twinckling of an eye, But that the other Spheares do let that vnder him do lye, Restrayning it of course so swifte, least that in turning round, The Seas with it, it should conuay, and all the earthy ground: For then no kinde of creature coulde leade here his life in them. O matter to be wondred at, who is not mazed when He wayeth with himselfe in minde so great a quantitie, So farre to passe in so short time, and backe agayne to flye, And neuer for to ceasse this course, and labour none to feele? Hereby do some beleue that Gods the worlde about do wheele. Of them to euery Circle is a mouer strong assignde, Who like as they that are condemned in bakehouse for to grinde, May neuer ceasse from turning round the Skies both day and night, Nor though he would can once haue time to rest his wery spright. Now surely happy is that God that serueth in the same. But these are toyes, and fansies fond of such as seeke for fame. What store of fonde Foolosophers, and such as hunte for prayse, The earth brings forth, it is not good to credit all he sayes, Though great his estimation be in mouthes of many men, Though many Reames of Paper he hath scribled with his pen. For famous men do oftentimes make great and famous lies, And often men do mysse the truth though they be neuer so wise. Therefore must reason first be sought, for in such doubtfull things, More credit reason ought to haue, than mennes ymaginings: For such are often proued false. What thing doth reason say? That Skies or Starres are moued of Gods or of their proper sway? What honour great, what kinde of ioy, what pleasure can there be, Unto these Gods that turne about the Skies continually? That they for life of foolish man may needefull things prouide, And that the Birdes and sauage beasts and Fyshes they may guide. Becoms it Lordes in such a sorte their seruants here to serue? And Gods for euer to be thrall, that they may beastes preserue, That they may foster Foles &amp; Knaues: is it not rather meete For Gods to enioy their liberty, and pleasaunt freedome sweete? That they may wher they list go walk, least as in fetters tyed, They can not passe from place to place, but styll at home abyde? Or as the potters plying styll the wheele and lumpe of clay, Can haue no time of quiet rest, nor steppe from place away. Seemes it so sweete a sporte to them the compasse round to moue, Or can this laboure neuer grieue the Gods that syt aboue? O sentence worthy to be markde of graue and witty men, But reason bars them this, and cryes contrary quite to them. For nothing is eternall here but only God alone, And after him continuall be the Natures euerychone. Of things that he of nothing made. But yet by sure decree, That otherwise they cannot shewe than they appoynted be, By him when first he framd the world, so styll continuall shall The waters soft, the fier hote, the earth a stedfast ball. So shal the ayre for euer moue, so of necessity The circles of the Heauens round shal turne continually, So force and fashion euery herbe deliured doth retayne, And euery tree, and euery beast that neuer time can stayne. As long as vnremouing state of nature doth endure, As long as chaungeth not the wyll of GOD diuine and pure. Wherefore if thus continuall be the course of Heauens bright, It must be naturall as shewes in wayghty things and light. For what of nature propre is doth neuer feele decay, But if another moue the same in time it falles away. For no such state of violence doth last continually. Haue heauy things &amp; light more force than state of Starres and Skie, That they can moue of propre strength and these can not do so Except of Gods they caused be about in course to go? Then is the earth and fier farre more noble than the Skie At least for this bycause they neede no helpe of mouer by. But of themselues from Center they or can to Center flie. Wherefore we must beleue that these celestiall states aboue Of proper force and of their formes, as fyer and earth do moue. For nature is of greater might than mouer any one. This nature onely God excelles and him except alone, No better thing than nature is nor in the worlde more hie. I nature call the fixed law of him that guides the Skie, Which fr? the worldes foundation first to all things he assured, And wyllde that it should stand in force while age of worlde endured, For this same lawe hath God vnto the formes of things assignde That when from thence do things procede formes wel fulfil Gods minde, Ne can they once this order breake, for of their formes do spring Such things as he commaunded hath, who framde eche formed thing. This true and proper nature is of higher state agayne Then matter or forme as some haue taught for certainly these twayne Are rather springs of eury thing or causes first aboue Or framers first, not nature sure if truest names we loue, Except we haue a better wyll false names to giue such things. But of this same enough we haue, now strike we other strings, And whither that the stately roomes of Heauen empty be, Or whither any dwellers there haue place and souraintie. The present time doth me persuade in wonted verse to syng. Syth Heauen is so vast and wyde and such a gorgeous thing, All garnisht round with glistring Starres so bright and fayre to th' eye Shall only voyd and empty it and vnreplenisht lye? And earth and seas such dwellers haue? or is the seas or ground A place more pleasaunt, fayre and good or more in compasse found Than all the Skie by which they more than Skies deserue to holde, Such store of creatures fayre &amp; shapes, and fashions sundry folde? Is it a parte of prudent Prince to builde a pallace wyde With golde and Marble beautified throughout on eury syde And not (saue stable) to permit there any man to lie And furnish out such goodly roomes and sumpteous buildings hie? For Earth is stable to all the worlde wherein all filth doth bide Dust, dyrt, dung, bones and carion, and lothsome things beside. Who can at any time rehearse the heapes of things vncleane That on the seas and earth appeare and euer shall be seene? Who knoweth not the showrs, y? mists, the cloudes and flakes of snowe, The force of windes &amp; rage of stormes, that on the seas do blowe, That shakes the earth &amp; moues y? ayre? Yet playnly may we see The Seas and Earth with sundry sorts of creatures full to bee. Shall then y? heauens cleare be thought as voyd and empty made? O rather voyd and empty mindes that thus your selues persuade. For creatures doth the Skies containe and eury Starre beside Be heauenly townes &amp; seates of saincts where Kings and Commons bide But perfect Kings and people eke, all things are perfect there, Not shapes &amp; shaddowes vain of things as we haue present here, Which death sone takes &amp; time destroyes, defiles, and driues away. There wise and happy folkes, and suche as neuer do decay Do liue, here misers dwell and men that certayne are to dye And doltish fooles. There peace &amp; light and pleasure chiefe doth lye: Here dayly warres and darknesse blind and eury kinde of payne. Go now, and prayse this world &amp; take delight in life so vayne, Presume thou foole than Heauens faire the earth to set more by. But some may doubt if that more str?g than Diamond be the Skye, And empty place is none therein, how Gods there dwelling be And mouing there? this semeth sure with reason not t'agree. Besydes since that the Heauens bright can not with plowe be torne, Nor digd with spade, how there shal vines and nedefull graine be borne? These are but toyes &amp; laughing stocks, for though the Skies be harde, Yet passage haue the dwellers there, nothing their course hath barde. For vnto these celestiall states the Maiesty deuine Appoynted slendrest bodies hath of substance light and fine, So that no neede of dores they haue, nor yet of windowes wide, For through the thickest walles they run and through the Marbels slide, So pure and fine their nature is, and of so strong a might. Who, (if so be they neuer had bene subiect to his sight) Would thincke that fish in flouds shuld bee and frogs in slime to breede, And Salamander liue by fire, of ayre Chamelions feede And Greshops nourished with deawe? yet true this same we see, And we confesse them wonderfull, for many things there be Which though we think can not be d?e yet can and oft are done, Why could not God then creatures make that through y? earth shuld run And of no meate nor drinke haue neede? if he so could he did, Fond were it such a space to builde and leaue vnfurnished. But Heaueners haue no neede w? plow and spade for foode to striue Since that their bodies are not such as foode doth keepe aliue, Nor Gods do euer suffer thyrst nor Saincts an hungred be In fine they neuer greeued are with lack or pouertie. Bicause beyond the Moone there dwells no kinde of dolefull case For eury kind of mischefe, God vpon the earth did place And in the midst did them enclose forbydding them the Skie: O happy such as leade their liues thus in those places hie, That Nectar drinke, styll fed with foode of sweete Ambrosia greene Whereof in those Celestaill meades abundance great is seene. More happy and better is the life of such as dwell aboue, The hier they in Heauen haue their place to rest and moue, For places such as in the Skies are hier in degree, More blessed are, and better farre, than those that lower bee. What are the blackish spots that in the Moone we may beholde? For of these same men diuersly their fansies oft haue tolde. Nought of it selfe doth shine in Skies saue onely Phœbus cleare, Of him the Moone receaus hir light and Starres that glister there, Who for bicause she is the last of all the Starres on hie, And lowest parte of Heauen keepes vnto the earth most nie, Shee needes must darkest be of all whereby sith eury side Shee hath not white, nor thick, nor pure nor meete where light may bide, For whitest parts and thick and light sunbeames at night receaue, The other parts that are not apt the same doth lightlesse leaue. Thus in the night the Moone doth shine but when the day giues light Much lyke in shewe to spotted cloude, in Skie shee waxeth white. So Gloewormes in the night do shine, but when the day returns By light they lose their light agayne that in the euening burns, And then their propre colour shewe all fraude and guile away, The night is meetest for deceyts true things appeare by day. Now if the world eternall be or if in time begonne It doth abyde a finall ende when many yeares are done, Is worthy to be vnderstoode. For of this question hie Haue diuers wisemen written bookes he sayth he doth deny, And authours fansies differing the thing doth doubtfull try And that the troth in secrete plighte all dark doth hydden lye. Some thinke that it beginning had and that the world did spring, Of matter that for euer lasts and force of mightiest king, When as before it had no state: and say that these same twayne Continued alwayes haue, and shal for euermore remayne, Matter, and the almighty Lorde, from whence all things doe floe. Some think the world of nothing made and those deny also That any matter was before, but by the word and wyll (Of God) all made. But others say so moude by reasons skyll, That neuer it beginning had nor neuer shall haue ende. Of these whose sentence truest is? sure I shuld condiscend (But that Religion me forbyds, and Christians that defend The doctrine olde of Moyses bookes) to credit none beside, But that the world hath alwayes bene, and alwayes shal abide. For why might not this world haue ben for euer heretofore? Bicause he could not do it tyll time, had taught him knowledge more, And then at length he finished it? Or could he alwayes it haue done but would not vtter more? What is the cause? why rather would he after than before? Or else what reason alterd thus his minde to other trade? If naught it were this world to make: why was it euer made? But if it meete and profitable were this world to frame, What is the cause that God so late created hath the same? Wherefore hath it so short an age? For, if we boldly may Deuines beleeue, eyght thousand yeres are not full past away, Since Adam olde created was. Beside whence doth proceede The cause why God shuld make y? world? for that he this did neede? If so: he should at first it made least he should greeued bee The lacke of such a goodly thing so long a time to see. If not: why made he it? in vayne? ought he for to deuise The thing that to no purpose is? of fooles this is the guise. Therof th? was some cause, but what? of troth assuredly, His goodnesse great and mighty powre, least that in vayne should lye These twoo shut vp in secrete close, but rather open be To eury man, for mighty and good in vayne is coumpted he By whome no great nor godly thing hath neuer yet bene wrought. If God therefore was euer good, and euer mighty thought, Why would he not haue alwayes builte this goodly world we see? Why let he such a thing till nowe of late deferred bee? No reason truly can be found except some subtile brayne Make more acc?pt of toyes than truthe and foolish fansies fayne. Wherefore, if we to reason sticke then must we surely say That this same world hath euer bene and neuer shall decay. But if that GOD sayd otherwise long since, and then did giue To Moyses knowledge of his workes, we Moyses must belieue: Let reason alway yelde to fayth, and there as prisoner leaue, For GOD can not deceaued be, nor neuer doth deceaue, If any time he do vouchsafe by words with men to deale, If that appearing vnto man his secrets he reueale. But they that first this Chaos and continuall matter taught, Do trifle much. For why should God leaue it so long vnwrought If he forthwith could make the world and at the fyrst create All kinde of things? In vayne it is for to deliberate That presently may well be done. But some haue surely thought Eternal state the world to haue of no man made or wrought, But of it selfe as now it is, before all ages past, And of it selfe as now it is for euermore shall last. Which sure is false: for reason doth hir selfe this same deny, For two most perfect things can not in order euer lye: But would fal out betwene themselues and strife thereby maintayne. Well, graunt that in a faythful league they alwayes do remayne, In vayne two heads allowed are, for one shall wel suffise, Bicause at least dame nature ought before the rest to rise. And if before the rest she be, then is she cause of all, For formost cause doth alwayes frame the things that after fall. Wherfore doubtlesse the almighty lord this world himself did make Of nothing, and eternall to. But how? the reason take. Eternal goodnesse hath the Lorde, eternal powre hath he, May not likewise his wyll to make the world eternall be? Which if it were, as reason shewes: nought lets but world may be Continuall built by workeman hie, in such a fayre degree. As who soeuer graunts the Sunne continuall to haue bene, Must needes confesse, the light thereof continually was seene: Yet is the light the Sunnes effect, and Sunne the cause we call. But let vs search the Elaments and from the Heauens fall, And not vnworthy things of them let vs now vtter playne. Some men haue sayd that vnderneath the Skies a fire doth rayne Neere to the Moone, but voyd of light: and kindling hastily, And wondrous hote, which to be true doth perfect reason try. For in the night we may beholde the fire in Skies to flie, And flashing flames throughout y? aire and Starres to shoote from hie. Which doth proceede of damps that in the ayre do rise more hye, And burned is by force of fyre that there aloft doth lye. For of twoo sorts is vapoure, one light, drye, and soone begoonne To fire, whereby the flaming sights in Skies are causde to runne, The other more colde, more waighty &amp; grosse, engendred of this same Are showrs &amp; clouds &amp; snowes &amp; mystes and windes with flashing flame, And thunder, haylestones, deaw &amp; rayn, if fier were none aboue, No vapour there could kindled be, in euenings darke to moue. Moreouer, since in lightnesse thus the fire doth ayre excell, No remedy, but needes it must haue hier place to dwell. His seate therefore is vnder Skies, and next to Moone doth lye. Beneath this fire hath ayre his place which in his partes most hye A feruent heate of fire doth take. The myddle partes most colde, Doth th?der, clouds, &amp; lightnings brede and tempests sundry folde. The lowest parte is warme and moyst for vapour that doth rise From flouds continually it moysts ascending towards the Skies, And warmd it is by beames of Sunne that back from earth rebound, Here mists &amp; showrs and plesant deaws and snowes and frosts are found, Which sundry sorts of winds do breede for no small powre is dealt Unto these windes, and oftentimes their force in ayre is fealt, These can in time of Sommer cause the nipping coldes to come And in the winter season sende abrode the warming Sunne, These can both giue and take away from vs our corne and grayne, These can both breede and beare away great sicknesses and payne. From out the East doth Eurus blowe. and from the Libian coast Doth Auster come, and Zephyrus from westerne parts doth poste, But Boreas blastes in Scythian hilles and Northerne partes doth rise. More windes there are, all rule the ayre that lower lies, And with the ayre both land and sea. Of windes the cloudes do breede, And from the cloudes do flakes of snow and showers of rayne proceede: Dewes, lightning, hayle &amp; early frosts: but with diuersty of times, And eke by sundry wayes and meanes and blastes of sundry windes. Whereof such as from South do blow, breedes cloudes &amp; showers, &amp; heate, But those that from the Scythian partes do come, cause coldenesse great. From these coms yse &amp; snowes &amp; frostes when winter dwelleth heere: But in the Sommer time they serue to make the weather cleere. The westerne winde breedes flowers, &amp; gro?d with greene doth new aray, And giues the birds a cause to sing, and filles the woods wyth May. Oft times the Easterne winde is good yet now and then doth rayse Such tempestes great, that seas &amp; land by force thereof it frayes. These windes the ayry sprites aboue or Starres abrode do send, And oft when as the Coniurer for treasure doth intend In earth to delue, or consecrate his booke in Magike wise Some sprite to binde, then haue I heard that windes which then did rise And suddayne storme hath layd y? corne, and grapes did downeward fling. The matter making windes is mistes that from the flouds do spring, The cause that moueth them are sprites that in the ayre do dwell, But this will not the common sorte allow, nor credit well. What th?? cast not such precious pearls to Dogs or filthy swine: Beleue it you that learned are, whose mindes are more deuine, That not alone in Skies but in the ayre, there thousands be Of sprites that moue the raging winds and tempests that you see And thunder down w? lightning throw. Yet do I not deny But other causes are that blastes of windes are moued by, As Sunne and Moone and Starres, but chief, the seauen which they name, The wandring stars that of these mists effects do diuers frame. I saw while as at Rome (P. Leo the tenth there raygning than) I was, a peece of potters worke and picture of a man That from his mouth of straightest sise, a mighty winde did blowe, For all his brest being hollow made with water full did flowe Which being with heate of fire resolud, out of his mouth it went In mighty winde, and farre from it the force thereof was sent. This proues y? wind proceedes of flouds that thus resolued bee While vapour mounting vp is forcde by meanes of heate to flie, For contraries do euermore eche other driue away. In this same lowest parte of ayre as we before did say, The blasing starres do oft appeare that fall of Prince doth showe And there with diuers colours died appeares the stormy bowe. This same y? beames of Sun doth cause that on the cloudes we see, The other made by some one starre of them that mouers bee, Which while the vapour vnderneath doth shape thereof receaue, Appeares a tayle, and in the clouds his flaming light doth leaue Like as the Circled myst that doth encompasse round the Moone The circled mist (as men do say) a signe of winde to come. As wh? three s?nes are thought to shine and yet they are not three But shaps of s?ne that framd in clouds as in a glasse we see. But vnderneath this ayre so grosse and lowe, the Seas haue place: The Occean Seas that all the earth in circuite do embrace, Which passing through y? narrow straights where Hercles pillars showes It spreds it selfe, and thus abrode both farre and wyde it flowes. And this is namde by sundry names Aegian flouds it makes Ionian, Tuscan, Adriatike Red Seas and Persean lakes. This Sea doth search the secrete caues that lowe in earth doth lye, And euermore doth ebbe and flowe and tasteth diuersly, As diuers is the earth, by which he doth his passage make, And of the brimstone sulphured vaynes doth smell of brimstone take. This is the cause that fluds their cours mayntayne continually, For to their springs they ofte returne, and oft to seas they flye, And roll and passe from place to place and round in compasse driue: And do preserue the earth as bloud. preserues the corse aliue. The selfe same fluds doth make y? lakes and fennes of filthy ayre, And cleare and Cristall r?ning springs and wells for euer fayre. In fine from Occean seas proceedes all course of waters heere, That round about the world retaynes. This made the waters cleare That parte beneath the earth do lye, and parte aboue doe runne, And such besides as from the cloudes of Hellish dye do come. But wherefore is the Seas so salte? doth it of nature spring? I thinke not so. For euery tast that seas with them do bring, Doth fetch his cause from out the earth for in the earth are found Great hilles of salte that vnderneath the waters deepe are dround, Seas sucks this salte and doth resolue it into water cleare. Thus Salte not Sunne, is cause that salt- nesse doth in Seas appeare. For why doth not the Sunne likewise of Ponds salt water make? For all such partes of earth as were not meete for man to take Bycause they were to full of salt hath nature vnderlayde, The Occean seas more frutefull partes to vs she hath displayed, Wherein are mountaines, hils &amp; cliues rocks, fields and valleyes lowe, Straights, countreys, woods and ponds lakes, springs &amp; streames that flowe, Small townes, great cities, broughes &amp; holdes with stones and metalls pure Such things wherby the life of man the better doth endure. The rule of all this earth and goods to man the Lorde did giue, And made him King of eury kinde in seas or land that liue: And wit and reason to him dealt by which he might excell And guide the world, and seruing God him loue and worship well. Amyd this earth a Center lies, whereby it is sustaynde, For thither falles eche waighty thing, as God at first ordaynde, That neuer of their propre force can from this Center flye, And therefore fixed stands the earth and in the mydst doth lye Sustayned with hir heauy waight, that fast on eury side To Center runs and frames a ball both darke and thick, and wyde: About the which wyth Crimsin horse the Sunne is alwayes lead And on the parte contrary styll the darkesome night is spread. For nothing else but shade it is of earth and waters great, Which shadow if in night it chaunce vpon the Moone to beate Doth cause Eclipse, and filles w? feare the wofull gazers hearte, Supposing that opprest shee is with charme of Magike arte. This shadow makes the longest nights when farthest from vs burnes, The flaming Sunne, and shortest when to Northerne signes he turnes. The cause thereof is swelling earth and stately mountaynes hie, Which subtile nature hath deuised in place betweene to lie, That with their tops in change of time the nights they alter may. For looke when neerer vnto South the same doth keepe his way, Then farther forth their shadowes dark these hilles abrode do fling Such shades as hide the light and cause the day more late to spring, And force the day in shorter time and space his course to ende. Then frosty winter vnto vs his quaking colde doth sende, Then s?mer makes the Indians blacke with raging heate to frye. But when the Sunne returneth backe to toppe of Cancer hie, Then shorter are the nights with vs and heate beginnes agayne, Then winter vexeth those with colde that vnder vs do rayne. Thus doth the S?ne with diuers cours both alter times and tides, And in foure equall partes the space of all the yeare deuides: And rolling round about the earth, both nations serueth well, Both them that vnder vs do liue, and them aloft that dwell. For men liue also vnder earth, not onely woods and streames, Nor nature willde that Sunne and day in vayne should cast their beames And onely serue for brutish beastes and sortes of swimming kinde, For all the earth is dwelt vpon no place therein we finde, Nor any clime there is, but that there mortall men may dwell And finde out places fitte for them and seates that serue them well: Though colde extreme, or to much heat rayne there continually: Where nature mischiefes doth permit there plants she pleasure by And wise she mixeth sowre with sweete, and where diseases raynes There hath she poynted remedies that can release the paynes. Therefore wheresoeuer to much heate anoyes the inhabitant No mountaynes colde nor cooling blasts no shaddowing trees do want Nor pleasant streams w? store of springs whose coldenesse may defeate The harmes that happen vnto man by force of raging heate. Besides the night hath equall length there all times with the day Which with an euen cooling force doth heate of Sunne alay. wherby we iudge the myddle Zone not voyd nor empty lies But peopled well, by nature safe and meanes that they deuise. So th' vtter Zones where as they say no kinde of people dwell, with snowes and yse all couerde styll men may inhabite well, As reason good doth vs persuade. for there great store of wood Doth alwayes grow, &amp; garments there are made both great and good, wyth furres of sundry sortes of beastes, and stoues are many there wherew? men well may warm th?selues and winter nothing feare, And bytter colde by many meanes they well may driue away. Nor foode conuenient do they want but Cates at home they may (Or brought fr? other countreyes) haue and daynty kinde of fare, wherefore it is not true that some brought vp in Greece declare, That nature onely hath assignde one Zone of smallest sise For man to dwell, and all the rest that voyd and desert lies Alone to serue, for beast and fish this world vnworthy seeme, That nature graunting greater place to beasts them best esteeme. Wherfore if he may be beleeued that troth doth playnly tell No place there is vpon the earth but men may safely dwell. Dame natures ayde in nothing doth sustayne or feele decay, And witte of man the hardest things doth breake and beare away. Now last bicause vnto the ende with haste apace we hie, And time doth wyll vs to attempt the fishes of the Skie: Therefore I briefly will declare the cause why earth doth quake What force doth driue it for to moue what might doth make it shake. And thus we may be bolde to thinke that in the earth belowe Are many caues and mighty vawtes where boystrous winds do blowe. Which whilst with force they rage and striue, vpon the earth they beate And in this rage do ouerturne the walles and Cities greate, Tyll breaking out at some one place wyth force abrode they flye And blowe about in puffing ayre not long in rest they lye. These windes are bred within the earth of damps, which firy heate Doth draw from moysture neere about for many fiers great The earth within doth nourish styll, a wondrous thing I tell But yet no fayned thing I shewe, he can beare witnesse well Who so hath Aetna euer seene or bathes of waters hote, Or who so knowes the wonders of Veseuus viney plotte. These winds the wicked sprits do moue that in the lowest Hell Possesse their place, and in the depth of dongeons darke do dwell. For trifles surely are they not, nor words of vanitie That of the Stygian lakes, and of Auernus spoken be. No place doth voyd or empty ly but dwelt in euery wheare, Both vnder earth and on the earth, in ayre and firy spheare, In Skies and eke aboue the Skies where Heauen shineth bright, where as the glistring pallayce standes of Prince of greatest might That owner is of all the world. My Muse adieu farewell: And finally prepare thy selfe thy ending tale to tell. Pisces, the tvvelueth Booke Most glorious GOD almighty King thou Parent chiefe of name Whose wisdom gret this w?drous world of nothing first did frame, And gouerns it and euermore preserues it day by day, The spring and end of all that be to whome all things obay, Than whome more great, more good, or fayre, is nothing, nor more hie, That blessed liuest for euermore aboue the starry Skye. My minde desiring now to thee to clime doth nothing neede Apollo, Muse, Parnasus hill or springs that wont to feede The pratling Poets, fansies vayne when as they list to write Disguised tales that frantike heads of countrey Clownes delite. For, other ayde, and other grace it needefull is to haue, And streames of other fountayns swete I thyrsty now do craue. I thee beseech and humbly pray, on thee alone I call, That this my worke of late begoonne and labour last of all Thou fauour wilt, and gra?t me grace, to touch the appoynted ende, O Lorde thy holy sprite vouchsafe into my heart to sende, wherewith inspirde I may beholde the secrets of thy rayne And others teache, and with my verse immortall honour gayne. A sorte there are that do suppose the ends of euery thing Aboue the heauens to consist, and farther not to spring, So that beyond them nothing is and that aboue the Skies Hath nature neuer powre to clime, but there amazed lies. Which vnto me appeareth false as reason doth me teach. For if the ende of all be there where Skies no farther reach Why hath not God created more? bicause he had not skill How more to make, his cunning stayed and broken of his will? Or was it bicause he had not powre? but troth both these denies, For powre of God hath neuer ende nor bounds his knowledge ties. No kinde of thing may God conclude nor limits him assigne, Nor propre force doth once restrayne the Maiestie deuine. Great things I tell, and reason greate shall also this defende, If any thing the powre of God may ende or comprehende Then is y? thing more strong than God. For what thing can be found, That if it haue not greater force another thing can bound? But nothing passeth God in powre nor stronger is than he, Therefore he neyther can nor wyll with limits compast be, For who wold haue his force restraynd when that he may be free And walke abrode where as he list with powre at libertie? No man there is that doth desire himselfe for to abase, But rather all men arrogate to them a higher place, And alwayes seeke for to enhaunce the state that here they leade, And though their wings be large &amp; wide yet farther them to spreade. will GOD then while he may be greatest of powre omnipotent His propre force himselfe restrayne and liue in limits pent? This surely doth not well agree nor ought to be beleeued That God hath bounds, if that of none he euer them receiued Nor hath assigned to himselfe as we before did proue. These things foretold, we thus c?clude the works of God aboue Unbounded for to be, least that his powre and maiestie, And knowlege should be counted vayn. For if aboue the Skie He could and might haue framed more and goodlier things by much But would not: then in vayne is all his power and knowledge such. For if that any man haue skyll and cunning in an arte, And neuer will in practise put the knowledge of his harte: In vayne he should vnto himselfe procure a workmans name, In vayne with wordes hee should c?mit his facultie to fame, Which should be rather folly calde and not a facultie. But in the state diuine of God and glorious maiestie, We must beleeue is nothing vayne since Godliest is the same. Thus God what so euer he could doe assurely did frame Least that his vertue were in vayne, and euer should lye hyd, But since he could make endlesse things it must be thought he dyd And all his power therein employed, so that there did remaine In him no kinde of power or force that ydle were or vayne. But learned Aristotle sayth there can no body be But that it must of boundes consist: to this do I agree, Bicause aboue the Skies no kinde of body we do place, But light most pure, of body voyd such light as doth deface And farre excel our shining Sunne, such light as comprehend Our eyes can not, and endlesse light that God doth from him send, Wherein togither with their King the sprites that are more hie Do dwell, the meaner sorte beneath in Skies do alwayes lie. Therfore the raygne and portion of the world consists in three Celestiall, Subcelestiall: which with limits compast be, The rest no bounds may comprehend which bright aboue the Skie Doth shine with light most wonderfull. But here will some replie That without body is no light, and so by this denie That light can neuer thoe be found aboue the heauens hie. But at vs vaynly doth he barke, in vaine he doth contend, For reason doth my words approue and veritie defend. I pray thee shew what is the cause that here the Sunne doth shine? Bicause his matter giues him light or rather forme deuine That doth so great a globe contayne? for forme and fashion gay To all things state of being giues, as Naturesearchers say: With whome we also do agree. this same doth playnly showe That Forme, not Matter makes y? sun to shine. From Forme doth flowe All kinde of force and comelinesse. And if so greate a light Assigned be to bodyly Formes, why should we in this plight Deny that incorporeall states may any light contayne? Since that more pure and fine they are and fayrer farre agayne. Wherefore the sprites and ghosts aboue do shine with wondrous light Although it can not be discernde of our corrupted sight: So that among these Saincts the more their state and powre is hie With brighter beauty much they shew and greater maiestie. No golde, no pearls nor precious stones nor pompe of purple gowne Doth them as it doth vs set out but light is their renowne. And as the Sunne amongst the starres doth shine with goodliest light, So shines among the Saincts aboue the LORD of greatest might And neuer darkneth them a whit, but makes them all to shine, Such is the goodnesse of his grace and maiestie deuine. But here perchaunce he wyll obiect that in the ayre doth lye No ground of light, and since no ayre there is aboue the Skye He wyll deny that there is light. But now he lies agayne, For ayre is not the ground of light, nor as some fondly fayne Is light in ayre, but contrary the ayre in light doth dwell, If reason what, not Aristotle doth say he marketh well. For if without the dores fast shut a candle burneth bright, Or by some clift the fier shine in house all voyde of light, And some therewith the ayre about the beame with striking shakes The ayre is forced to passe the light but light no mouing makes. And if the ayre were ground of light then with one motion so Both ayre and light should moued be and both togither goe. Beside, if that in time of night a man with Torch in hand Should passe, y? light doth places cha?ge but ayre doth quiet stand. Which if to light it subiect were it should continually Go wander place by place with light and styll keepe company. But now this same is nothing so but doth contrary proue, For light doth passe when aire doth stay and styll with torch doth moue. Wherby it appeares that light doth not the ayre as subiect neede, But well may stand and well wythout the vse of ayre proceede. Especially the light of God whereof a parte doth passe Into our sunne and there is kept contaynde as in a Glasse. For as within his propre spheare that vnder Moone doth lye No fier can discerned be by force of any eye, But if that any matter chaunce to kindle with the same, Then Starres do fall and firy streams in Sommer nights do flame And other sights that feare the mindes of men in dreadfull wise. So as it is the light of God can not be seene with eyes, But fixed in the Sunne it shines bycause the matter cleare Whereof the Sunne is made is fitte and apt for light t'appeare, For God hath framde it in such sorte, as there his light may byde And shine, creating day and life and goodly things beside. That light doth also shine in shapes of sundry sacred sprites Though not alike to all as Starres shine not with equall lights But some more bright than others be as they are set before. And as a candle can giue light to many candels more And yet doth neyther lose nor lesse his beauty burning bright, So light of God decreasing not to other Saincts giues light. But some percha?ce will here dema?de and doubtfull question finde If that besides this light that I declarde of endlesse kinde Doth any other thing consist without the world so great Though this be neyther meete nor fitte for mortall men t'entreat Yet wyll I proue to passe the path wherein no Poet yet That hath bene hitherto before might euer set his feete, And wyll attempt to bring to light the treasures hie in place Of God if he be pleasde and helpe with his accustomed grace. First must we gra?t that God is spring and Father eke of all Who made all things and best &amp; chiefe him may we truly call. Therefore where so euer GOD abides his glory there is found, And euery good and gorgeous sight doth in that place abound. And thus what so euer good the earth the seas or ayre contaynes, All this is seene in place whereas the LORD almighty raygnes. And though no matter be in such, yet iudge not thou therfore They being lacke, for perfecter and fayrer they be more than things that are of matter made. For forme that can it selfe sustayne wythout this matters hand, Is perfecter than that which voyd of matter cannot stand. Therefore all voyd of matter there things perfect are and pure And in despite of fretting age and force of fate endure. And store of goodly things are there that in this worldly light GOD hath not made, from which proceedes great ioyes &amp; Saincts delight, Such ioyes as tong of mortall man can neuer full define, Such ioyes as neuer can decay with space of any time. These incorporeal formes were known to minde of Plato hie, Although the enuious sorte do scorne his bookes full bytterly. But eury man doth not aspire these mysteries to knowe, A fewe them finde to whome the LORD aboue doth fauour showe, And giues to them his light that they these things may playne beholde. In fine, there sprites and Angels are as many thousand folde As all the woods contayne in leaues or all the shores in sand, Or all the Fishes in the seas or starres in Skie that stand, Yea, number none can them containe, for since that GOD could frame Them numberlesse, he sure so dyd the more to spread his name, Especially since that the world doth voyd of limits lye, As is before declared playne and reason strong doth trye. But since they voyd of body be and Matter all away Therfore they neuer chaunge in tyme nor age doth them decay, No greefe they feele, nor sleepe nor foode at any time they craue Nor labour knowe but ioyfull youth continually they haue And freedome chiefe, no bondage there no seruants in degree Nor none there are that there compels, nor none compelled bee, One onely Lord they do confesse the King and spring of all Him worship they and him they loue and serue in generall, They willingly do him obey and serue in euery thing Reioycing all his laud and prayse and wondrous actes they sing Eche one doth there apply himselfe to please with goodly grace, No fighting there, no cancred spite nor enuy can haue place, Continuall peace there florisheth great loue and concorde great Among them is suspicion none no craft nor false deceat. In fine the goodliest parte it is of all the world beside, And farre more worthy are the sprites that in this place abyde, Than those that in the Skies do dwell and in the Starres do lye, For looke as lower euery spheare doth come to earth more nye, The meaner sprites it doth contayne, and meaner goods doth giue, And so much baser is the same. whereby such things as liue Aboue the Skie, as they most fayre and good, and blessed show, So those that in the bowels darke of earth do dwell below, Are most ylflauoured, vile, and yll, and there not all in vayne The stinking lakes and soyels of Hell to be did Poets fayne: Of Hell where men do after death their paynes for mischiefe take And vainely seeke for rest and peace in euer darkned lake. But wherfore waste I words in winde and striuing all in vaine Doe seeke vnto such Buzzards blinde the trothe to open plaine? So sore the state of mankinde dotes that it will neuer knowe That eyther Gods in Heauen be or sprites in Hell belowe. But most men laugh if any man do tell them credibly That after death the soules doe liue and neuer more doe dye. Hence springeth it that night and daye they richesse seeke to gaine This is their greatest carke and care their greatest toyle and paine That they in Golde and Iewels maye their neighbours farre excell, Golde is the thing that all men seeke in golde their hope doth dwell. For thys, runnes into raging warres the Captaine stout of minde For thys, his Children wyfe and house and countrey left behinde The Marchaunt cutting foming seas in shyp with sayles set out Assayes the blewe and dreadfull gulfes and coastes the worlde about. Eche man doth practise craft and thefte this golde to keepe in sight Golde euery man desires and loues golde pleaseth euery wyght. Ne feare they any kinde of paynes that after death is due O altogither earthly men that onely in the viewe Fr? beasts are know?. C? you nought else than golde to knowledge call? By which a wyse man from a foole doth differ nought at all Wherewith fonde fortune ill men oft habundantly doth feede Learne you that many things there are that golde doe farre exceede Which vnto fooles and wicked men, of God not giuen be These are the vertues: Godlinesse iustice and prudencye And wysedome passing farre the rest. These goods who doth retaine A mortall God is and the same immortall man agayne That after death shall happy be, but he that hath them not And staines himselfe with filthy sinnes (when death his shaft hath shot) shall headlong into Hell be cast. These are not trifles, tales or dreames but true and sure they be, Yea most assurde, beleeue it well, you blinde, beleeue you me, Woe be to you if that you wyll not me herein beleeue For life shall quickly you forsake, and then you shall perceyue That I sayd true euen then when as your soules in Hell shall lye, You laugh: but this your ioy shall ch?ge to teares and greeuous cry. The time shall come when many men that now in welthy pride Do beare the sway and scornefully both God and man deride All naked, bare, in miserie and wretched case shall lye And shall of others ayde require with pyteous wofull crye. Wherfore O you that haue delight in good and Godly things Endewed with a better soule whose rootes from heauen springs. These earthly Gods that as the cloudes away doe swiftly flye Which fortune vnto fooles and knaues doth giue most commonlye, And which a fewe yeares ended once doth death take cleane away Regarde not muche, nor in such things your heape or treasure laye. Seeke you no more than that, which is for lyfe sufficient A small thing certes will suffise with little liue content. But let your chiefe delight be in the sacred seates on hye Seeke heauenly things w? all your force to this your mindes applye: In Heauen are the perfect goods that euermore remaine Which neuer foolishe dolt shall haue nor wicked man obtaine. In earth whatsoeuer doth delight are trifles all and toyes Which fooles and beastly people seeke and count as chiefest ioyes For which a thousande hazardes great they rashely vndertake And offring vp their foolishe brestes to death, they skirmishe make Of thys they bost the Bytle doth in dong reioyce to lye Things filthy, filthy folkes doe loue and villaines villanie. Leaue earthly things to earthly minds let swine in durt delight And let your only trauaile be to gaine the heauens bright. The goodlyest things doe best become the men of best degree And valiant things most meetest are for them that valiant bee. The earth is but a Chery fayre God hath to you assynde The heauens for your countrey sweete your countrey seeke to finde. That when from bondes of body thou escaped art and gone And left your fleshe for dogges to feede or wormes to gnawe vpon You there may alwayes happy liue from fleshe vncleane exempt And lame and often weary limmes wherin whylest you were pent Remaining in the vale of teares and in the mortall rayne Both many harmes and sicknesses and griefes you did sustaine For so the earth may called bee which is the stable sure Of all the worlde, the mother and the nurse of vice vnpure Wheras the raging Deuill dwels the king of sinfull kinde Wherfore it needefull is that you haue often death in minde And with your selues consider well how nere the dore he standes Still threatning with his deadly darte, in pale and dreadfull handes How suddainely he strikes therewith how oft he doth destroy The lusty youth and takes away our fayre and flowring ioye. O fading lyfe that subiect art to thousande casualtyes O to to shorte and doubtfull state that smokelyke from vs flyes Now this now that man drops away and thou this present day To morrowe I, thus at the last we all doe passe away None otherwise than simple sheepe that Butcher hath preparde In folde to kill, now these now those with knife he striketh harde. To morrowe other the next day moe thus all in time they dye Tyll that by this his slaughters great the folde doth emptye lye. This fading lyfe therfore despise which first beginning takes with teares his middest is toyle &amp; griefe and death conclusion makes. Who wyll delyght in such a lyfe except a foolishe braine? Seeke you an other lyfe to haue an other lyfe to gaine Whereas no mourning griefe or paine whereas no death is founde Thus happy state you shall receaue when carcasse comes to grounde You that haue hated sinne, and God haue worshipped holylie And haue not put your confidence in things that worldly be But chast, vnhurtful, milde and true haue liude in pure degree. But some perchance y? think how gods doe dwell in Heauens clere wold also learne some wayes or meanes (if any such there were) By which they might w? them haue talk and see them face to face O what a goodly thing were this and what a wondrous grace Than which no greater thing on earth I think can man obtaine But fewe deserue so great a state and honor for to gaine For many I graunt with diuels talke which easely they entice By humble prayers made to them or meanes of sacrifice Since farre they be not from the earth but in the ayre doe lye And oftentimes beholde and keepe the people companie: Yea vnto many they appere and serue them willingly And with the beautie great of youth enamoured oft they be. But Gods that in the heauen dwell the things that mortall be Disdaine to knowe and wicked factes of men abhorre to see As they that well doe vnderstande how foolishe and how vile Mans nature is how false and bolde and eke how full of guile Despiser and blasphemer of the chiefest maiestie Wherefore to haue the speache of them and see them presentlie Is labour great and seldome had bicause their eares they close To voice of men and turne away their eyes from giftes of those Which after that they be enrichde with seedes that others sowe A portion small of others goodes vpon the Church bestowe, Thinking that Heauen may be solde O two legged Asses blinde Thinke you that God is couetous? and precious stones doth minde? Or hath delight in glittering golde? or needes your helpe to haue? Doe you suppose that he is such as doth your fauour craue: Think you that brybes can him corrupt as many men they doe? No sure he is not got with golde nor giftes he looketh to: When that he liues in happyest state and blessed on euery syde, When his are all that earth contaynes or seas or heauens wyde How can you giue to God the things that his alreadye be? Doth not he rather giue to you the things that here you see? Therfore since neither they with giftes nor vowes will moued be A matter very harde it is them presently to see. Although the matter be so harde yet wyll we passe the way And what our force in this can doe by proofe we will assaye. First needes we must the meanes finde out that God doth best content Who is not moude with noble bloud nor vnto riches bent No king nor Ceysar he respectts nor triumphes doth esteme Ne careth he for such as are most strong and fayrest seeme. But these doth vtterly despise nor for the loue of them Uouchsafes the prayers to beholde or present sight of men Thus must we seeke an other way by which we may obtaine Their speache and presence for to haue perchaunce my verses plaine This way &amp; meanes shall bring to light if that the Gods aboue So fayre attempts doe ayde and helpe and wyth their sprite approue. The first thing is the clenlinesse of body and of minde By which, man well esteemde of God doth loue and fauour finde For all vncleanesse doth he hate and doth abhorre to see, So fayre and blessed is his state and of so hye degree. Wherfore we must at first take heede that we be perfectly Well purged and pure from filthines and all iniquitie Unclothed of our garments blacke and clad in comely whites Which colour best with God agrees and black with fiendishe sprites. A harde thing is this same I graunt for who doth here remaine That leades his life without a fault and free from blot or staine? To euery man hath nature delt some crime or vicious kinde And nothing is on earth so faire but fault therin we finde. Yet are there certaine sinnes so small and to such trifling ende That in a manner nought at all the eyes of God offende Wherwith he is not greued much no sores are these nor staynes But as the little freckels that in body fayre remaines Which easely the Lorde forgiues since well perceiueth hee How weake and frayle the nature is of such as mortall bee. But great &amp; haynous crymes doe much offende the mighty state And wicked men he alwayes doth abhorre, despyse and hate Nor wyll he once their prayers heare except they clense before And washe away their sinnes w? teares and whyte for black restore Requiring pardon for their faults with voice of mourning minde Obtaining once againe the pathes of vertue for to finde And casting of hys canckred skinne as in the pleasant spring The Serpent vseth all his skinne of olde away to fling. Who thus renewed departes &amp; leaues his slough in stones behinde And casting vp his head aloft with proude and stately minde His dreadfull hyssing doubleth oft with tong of triple kinde. Thus Gods are pleased, &amp; thus wh? as we rightly on them call They shewe themselues and thus to vs theyr prophecies let fall. Yet must there one thing more be had vnto this perfect whight A Crymsin colour must be ioynde, the beautie then is bright When as a purple redde with white well entermedled lyes What meanes this ruddy colour here? sure, loue it signifies. For loue resembled is to fire which fyre hath reddishe flame And both a colour and an heate proceedeth from the same. Therefore it needefull is beside that we the Gods aboue Doe hartely loue for he that loues deserueth to haue loue. For whosoeuer loues the Gods and liueth Christianly Can not be odious vnto them but shall rewarded bee And shall in happy state obtaine whatsoeuer he doth require But who is he that loues the Lorde? the man that doth desire In filthy entisements of the fleshe and pleasures for to sleepe? Or he that hath a great delight the rauening hauke to keepe, And (madde) in feeding dogges &amp; horse hys liuing doth decaye: Or he that seekes for hye estate that quickly fades awaye: An Owle that in the roufe doth sit a mate of Fortunes playe? Or is it hee that vpon God hath heart and fansie set And which he worships as a God by all meanes seekes to get? Beleue mee: they that earthly things doe couet to obtaine The things that in the heauens are regarde not for to gaine. No man can well two maisters serue for who so ioyes in white It followe must that he detestes the black and grisley sight. Who so delightes in light of Sunne him darknesse heauie makes And he that sweetenesse loues in bit- ter things no pleasure takes Who so approcheth to the earth must needes the heauens flye And where as loue of earth remaines no man can loue the skye But fewe (alas) and all to fewe these earthly things despise And able are with wings of minde to mount vnto the skyes. Wherfore? bicause it is so harde, to this doe I agree: But great rewardes makes greatest paynes both easie and light to be. what greater thing can be obtaynde than here with Gods to walke? And to beholde them with our eyes and thus with them to talke? This is chiefest Iewell sure for which we ought to beare Eache kinde of trauaile toile and griefe with good and pleasant cheare. The Cat would gladly milke receiue but feete she wyll not wet The way to vertue sure is harde yet shall th'vnslouthfull get Both vertue and honour vertues price the souldiour good obtaynes A due rewarde whereas no prayse the slouthfull cowarde gaynes. Therefore we must apply our selues with all our force and might That these so glorious states aboue in vs may haue delight Then euery thing we shalbe sure here prosperously to haue Both whilst we liue vpon the earth and when we are layde in graue. Why doe we thus esteeme the earth that sone we shall forsake O blinded fooles of fading ioyes we more account doe make Than of the goods that alwayes lastes what madnesse is this same? Nowe last remaynes that prayers oft with humble minde he frame That seekes the sight of Gods to haue which once for to require Suffiseth not but oftentimes we must and much desire Tyll at the length in space of time we get the victorie And as our minde desireth most obtayne the Gods to see. One stroke doth not cut downe y? Oke of olde and auncient yeares, Nor yet the stone by falling of one drop of water weares Nor Rome was builded in a day eche creature, grayne and tree In time spring vp, and in great space of yeares encreased bee. And thinkst thou such a w?drous thing and of estate so hie Can with so little paynes be done and wrought immediatly? So easly can we not the sight of earthly Kings obtayne Nor come to tell our tales to them and heare them talke agayne. Thinkst thou that Gods no better are than Kings that here we see Wherfore then should they come except they oft desired bee, Except we them as we doe Lordes in humble sort desire Wherfore we must on euery daye them oftentimes require. That they vouchsafe themselues sometime to shewe to vs in sight And with their talke the secrete things to bring abrode to lyght This if we doe (beleue mee well) at length they will appere And with their presence will vs blesse in wretched carcasse here And shortly bring vs to the skyes an ende of all our strife whereas the perfectest pleasure is and eke the happyest lyfe Then shall we passe and come before the maker great of skyes And haue the Prince of all the worlde in viewe of these our eyes Than which no better state can be nor more renouned thing who is of goodnesse and bewtye all the fountaine hedde and spring. But many think it can not be that vnto any here On earth the sacred sprites aboue should talke or thus appere And think that I but trifles tell. to these I pardone gyue. For nature hath not delt lyke wyt to all that here doe liue. Some still doe ponder in their minde the Heauenly ioyes aboue And alwayes think of hauty things some, meane things only loue And haue no pleasure much to rayse themselues from earthly place And thousandes on the grounde doe lye nor thence wyll ryse an ase. But earthly ioy doe only minde. sure in none other wise Than certayne byrdes that in the ayre aloft most hylye flye Where many keepe the midst thereof and mount not very hye The reast frequent the lowest partes and nere the earth doe flye. Wherfore it is no wonder great if what I here declare The common people not beleue whose mindes most brutishe are. Yet true it is that I haue tolde for how should any one Liue on the mountaines colde &amp; dwell in wildernesse alone And willing leade so harde a lyfe? sure perishe should he staight, Except some God him comforting should ease him of this waight. Beleue me he that liues alone auoiding companye Is eyther mad, or more than man doth talke with Gods on hye. In this sort liued the Prophets olde as it apperes by fame, And many after Christ whom men did holy Fathers name And in this present age of ours full many may we finde That leade their life &amp; sp?d their yeares in this same sort and kinde. These men when they do wisely speake and reason fayre and well And wonders great doe bring to passe and things to come foretell Wilt thou esteeme as mad or fonde or to be wayed lyght? Or rather wilt thou iudge they be inspirde with holy sprite? Besides the holy Church affyrmes that earst haue many beene That sacred shapes of blessed ghostes full oftentimes haue seene Why should not I beleue sith that the Church doth tell it mee? Therfore it is no fable fonde but doth wyth truth agree, That men may come to speake w? God and them in presence see Which I suppose the chiefest good and finall ende to be Of all good things that vnto man may any wayes aryse While as of thys hys present lyfe the troublous seas he tryes. And when escaped from mortall chaine the soule hath passage straight Conueying with hir selfe these three that alwayes on hir wayte The minde the sense and mouing force vnto the heauens hye Shall ioyfull go and there remaine in blisse perpetuallye: And dwelling there with Gods a God shall it created be. O Heauen great O house of Gods of fayrest dignitie How pure arte thou how wonderfull with Maiestie deuine How garnishte rounde about w? starres dost thou most brightly shine? Thou palayce well replenished with euery sweete delight. For if the earth habounds with things so fayre and good to sight The earth a place for man and beastes the vylest part of all what shold we think of thee wher dwels the Gods celestiall The Lordes and happy kings of all? O would to God that when My dolefull threeds the Systers three had fully finisht, then It thyther were my hap to come my Carcasse cast in graue: And euermore such wondrous ioyes before my eyes to haue And now by grace of God I haue of Zodiake finisht here Twelue starry signes which n?ber doth in these my bookes appere: A labour great with study long and tedious trauaile pende Yet finisht now and closed vp with last and finall ende. What thanks shall I thee gyue O Lord and Prince of euery lande That hast me willde so fayre and great attempts to take in hande And giuen me mind and might therto? the prayse is onely thine, If any fayre or goodly thing in these my bookes doth shine, For euery fayre and goodly thing from thee doth first descend Thou wert the fyrst beginning of this worke and finall ende: My minde and hand were gouernde by thy Maiestie deuine, To thee I onely giue the thanks the honour all is thine. But yet if any due desert on these my paynes attende I thee beseeche O Lorde that when my lyfe is at an ende This life that night by night I spend in dreames of vanitie And when the day retornes still vext with griefe and myserie Thou wylt vouchsafe in wyping out my sinnes to pardone mee Whatsoeuer I haue done (alasse) with mist of minde opprest And suffer thys my soule with thee in Heauens hye to rest. And thou my booke in this meane while thorow sundry cities run, Assured vnder cankred clawes of enuie great to come, For Carpers and Correctors thou shalt finde in euery place, Whose mouthes with teeth enuenomed shall tearing thee deface. Nor some shall surely watinng be which when they nothing can Doe worthy prayse wyll yet reioyce to rayle at euery man: And finding fault at others works will purchase foolyshe fame. Shunne y? such enuious whelps as these and mouthes that thus defame And searche for good and learned men which though but fewe they bee Yet happy mayst thou dwell with few, for fewe of best degree Hath God created here on earth to such go reuerently And all that we haue done laye thou before the vertuous eye Which if they lyke it doth suffise and what the rest doth saye Regarde not thou, but clownishe words with laughter passe awaye. The iudgement of the common sorte is grosse and eke their minde Is wondrous weake and foolishe things delights the foolishe kinde: All men the meate doe most desire that them doth best delight Eache pleasure is not acceptable to euery kinde of sprite But good and learned men the things of good and godly sense Giue eare vnto and reade and marke the same with diligence This is the foode that them doth feede and comfort of their minde And if foreshewing doe not lye vnto this vertuous kinde Thou shalt be heartyly welcomed and with a smiling looke Of them thou shalt perused bee. Go therfore blessed booke Abyde along and happy tyme, and when the ghastly graue Encompast rounde about with earth my carcasse colde shall haue, Through euery countrey (thou aliue) and realmes of sundry fame Go passe, and seeke in euery place to blase abrode my name FINIS. Non nobis Domine sed nomini tuo.</field>
