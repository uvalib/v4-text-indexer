[For as moche as yonge folke can not deuyse] For as moche as yonge folke can not deuyse, To passe tyme in more noble excersyse Than in the auncyent knyghtes practyse Of dayes olde. That were in tyme of Arthur kynge mooste bolde That this realme than named Brytayne dyde holde Of whose rounde table and noble housholde Were knyghtes good And dyuers of them borne of ryall blode And other that were of ryght manly mode That auentred bothe through forest and flode To gete honoure Remembraunce wherof sholde in euery houre Be vnto vs dayly a parfyte myrroure So that we sholde enforce vs to our powre To wynne suche lose As these knyghtes that were vyctoryose And though that it be now more sumptuose Than/than syth Mayes seruauntes gracyose Hath put in vre Of aunterose the olde auenture Called somtyme cheualrous pleasure Wherby they haue wonne of eche creature Laude in this Maye Durynge the moneth of Iune euery sonday Two chalengers in blewe dyde them assaye Of horse and man fyrst day was theyr araye Sarcenet blue And theyr armoure paynted of the same hue At the felde ende was pyght for to say true A pauyllyon on the grasse fresshe and nue Wherin these twayne Chalengers for to arme them dyde remayne Whan they were armed at ease without payne They yssued to begyn with all theyr mayne Theyr chalenge there Ageynst all defendauntes that wolde appere After the entre as is the manere About the felde they were brought euery where That was all playne Without a tylte abydynge tyme certayne By the kynge assygned our prynce souerayne With sporres sharpe two courses to sustayne In blanke armure Ageynst eche comer that lyst to aduenture The courses done with swerdes sharpe and sure Saue onely of theyr poyntes rebature They dyde tourney Full strokes syx eche other to assaye And eche man dyde his best I dare well say Eueryche of theym thought to bere the pryce away Theyr strokes done The defendaunt presented hym selfe soone Before a pryncesse that of this regyon Hath to fader kynge and Emperoure alone Whose vyctory Hye magesty with tryumphaunt regally And noble fame of prudent polycy Knowen is in euery realme vulgarely To his honoure And to oures of whome he is gouernoure Frome this royall reed rose and stately floure And frome the whyte of all vertue myrroure This yonge lady This confortable blossome named Mary Spronge is to all Englondes glory With bothe roses ennued moost swetely By dame nature That euery thynge lyuynge hath in her cure But whan she made this propre portrayture She dyde that myght be done to creature. And not onely For excellent byrthe but surmountynge beauty In the worlde of her aege moost womanly Lyke to be to pryncesses exemplary For her vertue Unto whiche pryncesse the defendauntes dyde sewe. Besechynge her grace to haue syx strokes newe To whose request this pryncesse fresshe of hewe Ryght soone dyde graunte Whiche had/they retourned on horses puyssaunt And gaue syx strokes the chalengers to daunt But who dyde best I make none auaunt But thus it was Pyeces of harneys flewe in to the place Theyr swerdes brake they smote thycke and a pace They spared not cors/armyt/nor yet vambrace They lyst not sporte For there were none of all the lusty sorte That scaped fre and he the trouthe reporte To all beholders it dyde grete conforte And fyrst of all To se the speres fle in tronchons small And to here the trompettes so musycall It was an armony moost specyall The tournay done Dyuers defendauntes touched theyr chalenge sone In the kynges presence thoughe I name none That for the same had made prouysyon Thus this day paste The nexte sonday the chalengers in hast Entre the felde and by the kynge they past And obeysauntly doune theyr heedes they cast And theyr araye Was blue bawdekyn of horse and man that daye The trompettes and other dyde them conuey About the felde and frome them went away In for to brynge The defendauntes that made shorte taryenge On horses barded ryght ryche to my semynge Whiche made after theyr in comynge Theyr obeyssaunce Unto the kynge bothe of Englonde and of Fraunce And tweyne to them with speres dyde auaunce And who that fyrst sholde proue his valyaunce He chose his spere The other to a chalenger one dyde bere Shortly with them togyder they ranne there As though neyther of them other dyde fere And so they ran. Tyll they had had two courses euery man. And than the tornay sharpely they began And as they dyde the fyrste day they dyde than Ualyauntly. The artycles dyde also specyfy The chalengers sholde haue in company Aydes twayne that sholde be there redy And so they had. That to armes were desyrous and glad And it appered by theyr strokes sad Theyr armes ought not to be called bad Who toke good hede. This day a chalenger was hurte in dede For whiche an ayde came that daye in his stede To byd hym hast hym doubte not it was no nede To the turnay. It were to longe to tell all done that day Therfore I wyll it for this tyme delay And parte I wyll shewe of the last sonday That Iustes were. The chalengers and theyr aydes in fere Were all present and gorgyas in theyr gere Blewe clothe of golde that were costly and dere Bothe horse and man. And to be shorte yf they the fyrst day wan Eche man honour in lyke wyse they dyd than They were commended of suche as tell can Therof the guyse. Though foles vnconnynge lyst some despyse And one of them sholde suche a thynge enterpryse I deme he wolde be a symple prentyse To chyualry. Yet suche that lewde be/be moost besy To reporte of gentylmen vylany And yet wyse men there beynge seeth not why Lay that aparte. And of theyr chalenge I wyll you aduerte In asure beynge a whyle ennamelde herte Bytwene .B. and .H. playn and ouerte Whiche were applyed. To Roy Henry and eke it sygnefyed In stedfast asure a colour constant tryed That the whyte herte w?out spot sholde abyde Euer in one This was therof the hole entencyon Though ony after his opynyon To the chalengers reprehensyon Lyst other say.
