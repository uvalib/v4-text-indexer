      <field name="fulltext">POEMS. SONNET I. THE FEELINGS OF A PARENT. Ah! who yet conscious of the social glow Of Nature—or whose generous breast can feel An offspring's future woe or future weal, The cause of sacred Freedom would forego, For aught luxurious Grandeur can bestow, Or Tyranny inflict? Who that can view In Meditation's glass the scenes of woe The darling issue of his loins must know Beneath the Despot's rod, but would pursue (To Nature, and to Patriot virtue true) The glorious chace of Liberty, and scorn Each fierce opposing danger—the fell steel Of ruthless Janissaries—the stern Bastille— Its bars, its iron doors, and caves forlorn, Ere leave a trampled Realm in chains to mourn? Tower, 12th July, 1794. SONNET II. TO TYRANNY. O HELL born Tyranny! how blest the land Whose watchful Citizens with dauntless breast Oppose thy first approach! With aspect bland Thou wont, alas! too oft, to lull to rest The sterner virtues that should guard the throne Of Liberty. Deck'd with the gaudy zone Of Pomp, and usher'd with lascivious arts Of glossing Luxury thy fraudful smile Ensnares the dazzled senses, till our hearts Sink, palsied, in degenerate lethargy. Then bursts the swoln destruction forth; and while Down the rough tide of Power Oppression drives The shipwreck'd multitude, no hope survives, But from the whelming storm of Anarchy. Tower, 14th July, 1794. SONNET III. TO LUXURY. HENCE, Luxury! fell opiate of the soul! Hence! with thy gaudy visions, that confound The wildering sense, and to the base controul Of Vice subdue thy votaries. On the ground Where thy detested drugs are strew'd, shall blow No flower of manly worth: there Liberty, That on the rugged cliff delights to grow Of virtuous Poverty, shall never shed Its soul-reviving sweets; nor there shall spread The wild flowers of Content, and guiltless Joy— The twining woodbine Friendship—nor thy flower, Fair Truth! that like the snow-drop, the stern power Of Winter's blast defies: No, Luxury! These, and each pure delight, thy noxious weeds destroy. Tower, 16th July. SONNET IV. TO SIMPLICITY OF MANNERS. O for the Spartan Fife, to pierce the ear Of slumbering Virtue, and again restore Those ancient Manners—simple and severe, That aw'd encroaching Tyranny!—No more Should'st thou, degenerate Briton! then deplore Thy desolated villages—thy plains, (Where Joy no more, nor rural Plenty reigns) Deserted for the distant, happy shore, Where smiles thy once-lov'd Liberty: and where No trampled myriads shed the bitter tear Of Want, that pamper'd Luxury may lie Stretch'd on her gorgeous couch, and quaff the strain Of soul-seducing Flattery, while the train Of Misery heave unheard the pleading sigh. Tower, 17th July. SONNET V. THE SOURCE OF SLAVERY. AH! why, forgetful of her ancient fame, Does Britain in lethargic fetters lie? Why from the burning cheek, and kindling eye, Burst no keen flashes of that sacred flame That wont the free-born energies proclaim Of Albion's hardy race?—Alas! we fly The homely altars—slight the once-lov'd name Of rustic Liberty, and deify Luxurious Pride. To her the pliant soul We bend degenerate! her vain pomps adore, And chace the simple virtues from the shore They wont to guard. Hence to the base controul Of Tyranny we bow, nor once complain; But hug with servile fear the gilded chain. Tower, 17th July. SONNET VI. TO ANCESTRY. O, THAT there were indeed some hidden charm— Some magic power in Ancestry!—thy shore, O Britain! then, renown'd in days of yore For gallant spirits, ne'er should brook the arm Of tyrannous Oppression;—then no more Should thy degenerate progeny adore The arts of splendid Slavery, that now Unnerve the soul, and of her 'custom'd vow Defraud thy once-lov'd Liberty;—the lore Of Freedom should be reverenc'd; nor the few, To ancient fame, and patriot feeling true, Who dare assert thy rights, deserted mourn— From each endearing tie of Nature torn, And from the dungeon's gloom their Country's fall deplore. Tower, 17th July, 1794. SONNET VII. THE VANITY OF NATIONAL GRANDEUR. ILL fares the land to giddy lust of Power, To Pomp, and vain Magnificence resign'd, Whose wasteful arts the hard earn'd fruits devour Wrung from the labours of the weary Hind, And Artist's curious hand:—the cheated mind May hail a while, 'tis true, the splendid hour, Delusive; but Destruction hovers near: The gaudy vapour fades!—dark tempests lour! And fell Oppression's thunder shakes with fear The enervate Soul. So the way-faring swain, Loitering in trackless wilds, intent, admires The gaudy clouds ting'd with Sol's parting fires, Till dark'ning mists involve the spacious plain, And rising tempests wake the prowling train— Then from his trance awakes; and wails his fate—in vain! Tower, 18th July, 1794. SONNET VIII. ON THE REPORT OF THE DEATH OF THOMAS MUIR, ON BOARD THE SURPRISE, IN HIS PASSAGE TO BOTANY BAY. AH, who shall now on happiness presume From Parts of Virtue, on this thankless earth, When, in the floating dungeon's noxious gloom, Muir falls a victim to his Patriot worth? That noble spirit, still for Freedom warm Enlighten'd, manly, eloquent, and brave, That fearless stemm'd Oppression's raging storm, Has sunk, subdued, beneath the whelming wave. Yet O brave Martyr! (if thy hovering shade Still feel its wonted ardour) let the tear And grateful honours to thy memory paid, With kindling hopes thy Patriot spirit cheer— Proofs that, with souls unaw'd, the virtuous few, The sacred cause of Freedom still pursue. Tower, 18th Sept. 1794. SONNET IX. THE CELL. WITHIN the Dungeon's noxious gloom The Patriot still, with dauntless breast, The cheerful aspect can assume— And smile—in conscious Virtue blest! The damp foul floor, the ragged wall, And shattered window, grated high; The trembling Ruffian may appal, Whose thoughts no sweet resource supply. But he, unaw'd by guilty fears, (To Freedom and his Country true) Who o'er a race of well-spent years Can cast the retrospective view, Looks inward to his heart, and sees The objects that must ever please. Newgate, 24th Oct. SONNET X. TO THOMAS HARDY, ON HIS CONDUCT ON THE DAY OF HIS ACQUITTAL. HARDY, whose Spartan virtue wakes the glow Of generous emulation—while the tear (Erewhile by Patriot zeal forbad to flow) Amidst thy well-earn'd triumphs, o'er the bier Of a lov'd Consort falls, our hearts bestow Responsive drops, and brighter still appear Thy manly virtues.—O supremely blest— Could worth our bliss secure!—Thy generous soul, By Nature's partial hand alike imprest With Fortitude, above the base controul Of Tyranny, and the diviner zest Of social Tenderness, a meed shall claim Beyond the Muse's praise, while deathless Fame Inscribes, in Freedom's shrine, thy Patriot name. Newgate, Nov. 6. SONNET XI. THE PHŒNIX. ON READING PHOCION'S FIRST LETTER IN THE MORNING CHRONICLE. PHOCION—or whether from the Phœnix tomb Of Junius, thou, with renovated youth, Awak'st, to soar like him on equal plume To Freedom's solar height, or art in truth That Phœnix self—with eager joy we view Thy daring flight, and thy bold course pursue With new-reviving ardour, from thy wings Shook thro' the bright'ning æther. Rarest bird, For splendor and unequall'd flight preferr'd. Still, o'er our sky when proud Oppression flings Her veil of threat'ning clouds, to chill the soul Of Britain's sons (once foremost at the goal Of virtuous Liberty) may thou appear Corruption's towering progress to controul, And Freedom's drooping train with brighter visions cheer. Newgate. SONNET XII. THE CRISIS. “I will not, like a careless poet, spoil “The last act of my play, till now applauded, “By giving the world just cause to say I fear'd “Death more than the loss of honor.” Beaumont and Fletcher. IT comes—the awful hour!—Compatriots dear, Who oft, confiding in my honest zeal, And keen attachment to the public weal, Bent to my artless theme the partial ear; Now search my breast with scrutiny severe: That breast which frequent in the swelling pride Of youthful ardor, the stern threats defied Of distant danger: mark, if now base fear Palsy its boasted virtue—or if now (Forgetful of the truths so oft upheld) Abject beneath the imperious foot I bow Of terror-vested Power—suppliant!—depress'd!— Or one emotion feel, but what the breast Of Hampden or of Sidney might have swell'd. Newgate, Nov. 26. ODE I. THE UNIVERSAL DUTY. I. THERE are, degenerate!—to the future blind— Who deem the Patriot fervor—the firm soul That spurns Oppression, and the base controul Of Tyranny, should be to him resign'd, To whose lone bosom for protection clings No tender Bride—to whose embraces springs No smiling infant, to awake the mind To social tenderness.—Ah, fond mistake! Freedom, the just inheritance of all, Should be by all asserted; at the call Of this eternal principle should wake, As at th' Archangel's trump, the slumb'ring world; And to the glorious standard, wide unfurl'd, Of soul-ennobling Truth impatient throng; While Civic-Virtue chaunts the martial song, And on their blood-stain'd Thrones fell Tyrants shake. II. The enamour'd Youth, stung with ingenuous shame, While at the Despot's nod his Country bows, Should blush to meet the Virgin's answering vows With unscar'd breast, or Love's endearments claim, Till his indignant Virtue had been prov'd In some brave effort. For the wretch, unmov'd By Patriot Virtue, tho' his outward frame, Blooming as spring, and gay as youthful steers, Promise Love's joyous harvest, yet, pursu'd By Slavery's abject terrors—aw'd—subdu'd— To Hymen's couch but half his manhood bears. Even hoary Age should fire the rising race With grave example; and, the dire disgrace To spurn, one brave, expiring effort lend; Scorning beneath a servile yoke to bend That of all reverence robs his silver hairs! III. But chief the Patriot flame should rouse the Sire To deeds of manly Virtue, and inspire The high disdain of Tyrannous controul. Each Grace New op'ning in the smiling face Of a lov'd Infant, should awake his soul To bolder energy: For who that traces, with delighted eye, In the Babe's playful features the soft smile Of a lov'd Consort, or the bolder traits Of his own manly form, but heaves the sigh, And feels the burning blush, to think, the while Inglorious indolence consumes his days, The chains are forging by encroaching Power Shall cramp those darling limbs, and bend that neck Round which his anxious arms so oft entwin'd! Ah! who could bear—nor curse his natal hour— To see his offspring to the general wreck Of fell Oppression hopelessly resign'd? Or who, with Nature's generous feeling blest, While o'er his couch the iron sceptre waves, Would strain a trembling Partner to his breast, And stamp his image on a brood of Slaves? Tower, 13th July, 1794. ODE II. I. 1. WHY toils my friend, to train the docile mind Of yon gay stripling to the arduous chace Of Virtue?—Why with greedy ear, reclin'd In rapturous trance (while o'er his blooming face The emulous suffusion steals, and wakes Athenian ardour in his kindling eye) Imbibes he the proud lesson, and partakes, In strong Imagination, the fierce joy Of Greece triumphant o'er the threat'ning hords Of Persia's despot, when the Spartan spear And Attica's firm phalanx mock'd the swords Innumerous of marshall'd slaves, by fear Alone of the fell scourge impell'd to wield The forceless steel, and unavailing shield? I. 2. Or when the patriot legend greets his ear Of Rome enfranchis'd from the galling yoke Of Tarquin, (when the patriot soul severe Of Brutus from the cloud of torpor broke; And, brandishing the reeking steel, that shed Chaste purple drops, fresh from the bleeding breast Of wrong'd Lucretia, on the Tyrant's head He pour'd avenging wrath—nor yet supprest The indignant Virtue, when his sons conspir'd Against their Country's freedom) wherefore swells His youthful breast with Roman ardor fir'd, While he, in turn, the like adventure tells— How in the assembled Senate with firm blow A second Brutus laid Rome's Tyrant low? I. 3. Ah, heedless parent! ere too late forego The dangerous lesson; nor with fatal zeal Wake that keen ardour for the public weal Which might, in happier times, renown bestow, And love, and admiration:—ah, forbear To rouse those generous feelings whence shall flow Down the lov'd cheek of him thy anxious care So fondly nurtures, the sad drops that show The inward-bleeding heart—the deep despair And anguish that the Patriot bosom tear, When Public Spirit buried in the tomb Of Avarice lies; and from the fruitful womb Of overgrown Corruption (unrestrain'd By shame, or soft compunction) bursts to day Oppression's monster brood—to havoc train'd, And waste, and fell rapacity—that prey Upon a Country's vitals, and destroy Whate'er laborious Virtue should enjoy. II. 1. 'Tis true, the antique tale may charm the ear Of Athens, long with Arts and Freedom crown'd, And Lacedæmon's hardy race, severe In Patriot Virtue; each for arms renown'd, And stedfast hate of Tyranny: nor thou, Peaceful Achaia! less canst warm the mind With sacred love of Justice:—for whose brow Equality a Civic wreath entwin'd Of all the softer Virtues that adorn Humanity—and which, but on the soil Where Freedom, like the dew-distilling morn Sheds her bland influence, ever deign to smile. But who would cherish now the sacred fire These glowing scenes of ancient worth inspire? II. 2. Lo, for the patriot, now, whose manly voice Loud in the cause of Justice, dare proclaim A trampled People's sufferings—or rejoice When Freedom triumphs, and, o'erwhelm'd with shame, The routed hordes of Despotism retire— Lo, what for him Tyrannic Power prepares, Insatiable of vengeance!—for base hire While perjur'd sycophants with treacherous snares Encompass him around. Canst thou endure The fruit of all thy cares immur'd should pine Within the Dungeon's gloom, and drink, impure, The Prison's pent-up breeze, where never shine Or Morning's cheering beams, or the soft ray That gilds with varying tints the fading day. II. 3. But what are these?—What is the Dungeon's gloom, The gale impure that round the sullen walls Creeps noxious, and, in deathful whispers, calls The fiend Contagion to assure the doom Which Tyranny pronounces?—What are these (The worst that wait upon the ruffian crimes Of Violence!) to what stern Power decrees Should rend his feeling soul who, in the times Of Tyrannous Corruption, dare proclaim A Country's wrongs, and the insulted name Of Liberty invoke—or call to mind The deeds of Ancient Worth, which (ere resign'd To Luxury and Avarice) the brave race Of Albion's sons atchiev'd:—the deathless fame Of steel-clad sires, who nobly dar'd to chace The royal Lion to the toils, and claim Their country's Charter;—the undaunted pride Of Hampden, who a Tyrant's wrath defied, And bled for Freedom;—or the virtuous zeal Of Russell, Sidney, who like martyrs died, The certain doom of Tyranny to seal? III. 1. To him, presumptuous, who the inspiring theme Dares thus recount of Albion's former fame, Or strife of Patriot Heroes to redeem Invaded Liberty—To him—oh, shame Of this degenerate age!—To him no more The cheering voice of confidence shall flow, Nor friend, nor gentle relative, explore The feelings of his heart; no more the glow Of social tenderness, whose smiles bestow Hope in despair, and in affliction joy, Shall warm his breast, but solitude consume His cheerless days, and the fine nerve destroy Of soul-ennobling sympathy.—Such doom Must Virtue now experience in the isle That vainly boasts of Freedom's partial smile. III. 2. And wilt thou yet the filial pupil train To deeds of Patriot worth? Wilt thou still seek To enforce the scorn of strong Oppression's chain, And call the blushing virtue in his cheek With themes of emulation? Generous Sire! Thine is a Roman's part—the awful zeal That fir'd the Consul's soul, whose Patriot ire Condemn'd his offspring for the general weal To ignominious death. Yet, oh, proceed; Instil the lore of Virtue, and imbue His youthful reason with the sacred creed, That not for self alone—not for the few Whom kindred ties endear, we live. The soul By Justice warm'd pants for the kindred whole. III. 3. Fired with this truth, the energetic mind Rises superior to the vengeful pride Of Power, and, with unfailing stores supplied Of intellectual ardour, leaves behind The world's ignoble passions—such as bow The flexile soul—and chief desponding Fear, That with ideal terrors arms the brow Of tyrant Death, and barbs the lifted spear. What then, to those who breathe the heart-felt vow At Freedom's shrine, and the pure flame avow Of Virtue—what are dungeons?—what the gloom Of Solitude, to him who thus can turn From Self to Sentient Nature— to the doom Of myriads yet in embrio, who shall learn To bless his virtues, and enjoy secure The Liberty he toil'd for? Blissful thought! Who would not bleed such prospects to insure, And own the patriot triumph cheaply bought? NELLY's COMPLAINT. A BALLAD. ON THE MARCH OF A DETACHMENT OF GUARDS FROM THE TOWER; TO JOIN THE ARMY IN FLANDERS. WHEN Willy first, by war's alarms, Was summon'd to the hostile shores, Keen sorrow dimm'd young Nelly's charms; And thus the nymph her fate deplores:— “Ah, foul befal the wicked wights “Who plunge the world in endless strife, “Which Love's delightful harvest blights, “And blasts each tender joy of life? “Must Willy, from his Country torn, “A stranger's doubtful cause sustain, “And leave his faithful maid to mourn, “O'er vows of Love return'd in vain? “Must he the weary march sustain, “And rest on the unshelter'd ground, “While ruthless winds, and pelting rain, “And countless dangers rage around? “Must he the graceful form expose, “That early won my virgin heart, “Where cannon, placed in murd'rous rows, “At once a thousand deaths impart? “Ah yet, ye great ones! pause and hear— “Let Peace dispel these dire alarms; “Ah! dry the widow's, virgin's tear, “Nor tear my Willy from my arms.” She sigh'd, and dropp'd the pearly show'r, And rear'd her pleading arms on high. But what avails to haughty pow'r The humble maiden's pleading sigh? Still, at the nod of ruthless pride, The widow-making cannon roars; And torn from Nelly's faithful side, Her Willy seeks the hostile shores. Tower, 5th July, 1794. STANZAS ON HEARING FOR CERTAINTY THAT WE WERE TO BE TRIED FOR HIGH TREASON. SHORT is perhaps our date of life, But let us while we live be gay— To those be thought and anxious care Who build upon the distant day. Tho' in our cup tyrannic Power Would dash the bitter dregs of fear, We'll gaily quaff the mantling draught, While patriot toasts the fancy cheer. Sings not the seaman, tempest-tost, When surges wash the rivven shroud— Scorning the threat'ning voice of Fate, That pipes in rocking winds aloud? Yes;—he can take his cheerful glass, And toast his mistress in the storm, While duty and remember'd joys By turns his honest bosom warm. And shall not we, in storms of state, At base Oppression's fury laugh, And while the vital spirits flow, To Freedom fill, and fearless quaff? Short is perhaps our date of life, But let us while we live be gay— To those be thought and anxious care Who build upon the distant day. Tower, Sept. 28, 1794. STANZAS ON HAPPINESS. WHO is the man that's truly blest? Not he who in inglorious ease Saunters thro' life;—whose sordid breast The sensual joy alone can please. Not he who waits the slow decays Of sickness or decrepid age, Counting the long—long—listless days That no benignant views engage. No; but the man whose generous soul Glows with the love of Human kind; Who, pressing on to Freedom's goal, Casts every selfish thought behind. 'Tis he—the Patriot—honour'd name! Blest with a heart that cannot fear, Can best the proud distinction claim Of solid bliss, and joy sincere. What tho' Oppression's iron fang Arrest him, yet in youthful bloom? He owns perhaps one kindred pang;— And then—exulting! meets his doom. His Country o'er the ruthless deed Perhaps the future tear may shed: But he can glory so to bleed As Russell and as Sidney bled! Tower, 18th Oct. 1794. ANACREONTIC. 'TIS not how long we have to live, But how much Pleasure is to come, That real Wisdom would enquire, Could Oracles proclaim our doom. Could we, like those before the Flood, Instead of years, by cent'ries count, If fetter'd by monastic rules, Say, what would be the vast amount? Days, months, and years—the driv'ller's tale— Are cyphers—and for nothing tell: Enjoyments are the numeral signs That Life's intrinsic value swell. Then let us seize the present hour, The bliss within our grasp enjoy; Since well we know, Bliss once possess'd Not Jove himself can e'er destroy. Who will, Oppression's power may aid, (Crouching beneath the iron rod!) And yield his cheerful powers of mind Obsequious to the haughty nod. For me—what force would grasp in vain I scorn, from timid awe, to give:— My Life the Tyrant may destroy;— But not my Pleasures while I live. Tower, 18th Oct. 1794. STANZAS, WRITTEN ON THE MORNING OF TRIAL, TO THE FOUR PRISONERS LIBERATED ON THE SAME DAY. PATRIOTS belov'd, with whom so long Oppression's fang I've borne, Attend the cordial, parting song, That greets this happy morn. Tho' o'er my head the harpy Power Still yell for guiltless blood, I hail the long-expected hour Fraught with your present good. Go, cheer again the kindred train, And long-divided friend; The fair one to your bosom strain, And all her terrors end. Go, fill the laughing goblet high To Freedom, Mirth, and Love; And, as the unheeded minutes fly, The social joy improve: For sweeter, from the lonely cell At length to life restor'd, Shall every soft emotion swell Around the social board. For me, who thus your triumph greet, The struggle still remains. And I with pride the contest meet May snap a People's chains. Yes—whatsoe'er my fate decree, This prospect cheers my breast, The contest shall assist to free A nation sore opprest. Should Tyrant arts my fall secure— A martyr, with my blood The seeds of Freedom I manure, Of Truth, and Public-good. But should I triumph, every power And effort of my mind Has tenfold virtue, from that hour, To benefit mankind. Newgate, Dec. 1. FINIS.</field>
