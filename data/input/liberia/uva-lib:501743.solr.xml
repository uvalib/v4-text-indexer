      <field name="fulltext">Monrovia Feby 4 th 1857 My dear Sir</field>
      <field name="fulltext">It affords me great pleasure to have this opportunity to address a letter to you. In the midst of danger &amp; death, while we could discern nothing above, &amp; around us but the blue canopy of heaven, &amp; under ous the deep, deep blue sea, we we were Providentially cared for, and bless to reach this our destined port, Monrovia . I am much pleased with this place inded, Monrovia is nearly as large as Charlotsville and has some fine houses in it. The people here are very genteel. I thought to find things different, and that we would have to enlighten tha people, but I find that we need teaching ourselves. There was not a death during the passage out, and up to this date all our folks are well, and very well satisfied indeed. For myself, I would not go back to America no how. I leave to day for to go up the St Pauls river and see how it looks up there: and when I have got a better knowledge of the Country, I want to write you all about: so as you may be informed and others through you how &amp; what the country is.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I expect to live in Monrovia , and I would be pleased if you would send me out some means to assist me in building me a place to live in, whatever you may be pleased to send me will be acceptable.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I beg to assure you that I have not experienced as warm a day yet in Liberia as I have generally ex perienced in the Summer in America, and this is the Summer season in Liberia. Just as soon as I can, I want to send you some Coffee from this country.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Since I have been here, I came across one mem ber of the Paxton family who came to Liberia some years ago, you may know something about them. they came of from the Carr family, Mr James O. Carr I think will have some knowledge of this family if you will mention it to him. The young man's name is John Henry Paxton, was but an infant when brought to this country, and is anxious to hear from his friends; he had an Aunt he says as his mother Huldah Paxton told him, that lived in Boucher Carr's family. Please direct our let ters to his care as Post Master General. [1]</field>
