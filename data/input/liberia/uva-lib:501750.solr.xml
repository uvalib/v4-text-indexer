      <field name="fulltext">April 24 Interior Settlement, Careys Burg, My dear Sir;</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I take this opportunity of writ ing You these few lines to inform you of the health of my family; and the rest of the immigrants which came out here with me; there are only two have had the acclimating fever; Mr. Young Bar rett and Mr. John Michie, they only had it slightly I thought there could not be any place in Af rica where new comers would build and notâ€” have the acclimating changes, but I see there is, men can come on top of this beautiful mountain, which is 25 miles from the Saint Paul's River and have but very little fever; If every one that comes here improved like we have this will be the very spot for immigrants for sev eral years to come. After our arrival in this place we have put up a neat little log church of which we call Union Church , as every persons who lived in this little settlement are trying to be one people for the cause of Jesus Christ our Lord; and since the completion of this church, we have drawn our lands and every body are trying to build as fast as they can; I was the first man out of our number that put up a log house and the rest are doing the same, and I hope we will try to do what we can if the good Lord's share is to build up our county. We have written back to Dr. Jas. H. Minor as you request us to do, for what we want and I did not think to remind him of putting up our provisions in half a barrels as we have so far to bring it, so please to tell him to have it done for us and direct it to Careys Burg and in the care of the Special Agent the Rev. John Seys, we would be very thankful that our little means which were left behind would be sent to us in pro visions which would be very good for all of us. There is no hinderance cause for us to build in this place if we only can get astart; there can be most everything grows here that is eatable, and if it is cultivated in a right manner; and, man will only plant it to grow, I see eddas, cassabas, potatoes plantains, and many other things, that are too tedious for me to mentioned now, there was twenty one of my people came out here to settled and all are at work today, and the ballance are at the Rec tacle at Monrovia the city of the Republic, and out of that number 17 have died in Clayash- land after they moved from Monrovia , all the old people excepting one, which Mrs. Franklin; my wife have improved considerably and also my daughter they have not lost one day since we arrived.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">If you please to send me smart cart if I live I shall work it out here, my love to all the enquiring friends Yours dear friend William Douglass</field>
