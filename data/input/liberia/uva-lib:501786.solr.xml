      <field name="fulltext">I take this opportunity of writing these few lines trusting they may find you well, and family, as I am quite well, I have been very anxious of hearing from you I has written you four letters during the war and could hear nothing which made me very anxious to hear from you, I could not tell whether you was dead or alive. Please to let one hear from you as early as possible and also let me your condition and your country's. I would like to come over but and had proposed doing so, but at this time I am very busy in sugar making &amp; farming and cannot well leave, Last year I made 8000 pounds of sugar, and I expect to make a great deal more with the Small machinery I have this year, I Sold last year's for $6 0 thousand. 1 I am also acting as agent for the Am. Col. Society for this last emigra tion that came from Lynchburg here Dec. 14 th 1865 , which keeps me very busy I therefore am oblige to give up the idea of coming as I proposed this march , but the pastor of our Church Albert Woodson is coming over in march and I expect him to call and See you and all the friends in that district for me. please answer this as Soon as you can to this as I may know all about you and if you are alive and all respecting you as I am longing to hear a word from an old friend as you. Also inform me something about my Children I could hear nothing from them neither during the war though I has often written them, but I chance to hear mention of them in a letter to George Walker from Mrs Reeves that two was dead and one she never mention her name at all Julia, which made me very unhappy. In 1861 when Dr. Hall was over here last I gave him $20 â€” in gold and a receipt for the Same was inclosed to you in a letter. requesting you to draw it from him and give it to my children but the war broke out before he could arrive to America and I have heard nothing about it Since. I and family is doing well here and are well, And I feel very proud that myself and family may be an example for those that may hereafter come to this country of Industry. I must close for the present untill I hear from you, Make our love and regards to your family and all inquiring friends</field>
