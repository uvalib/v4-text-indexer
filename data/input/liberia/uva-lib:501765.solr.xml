      <field name="fulltext">Careysburg 24 th Jan, 1868 My dear Aunt,</field>
      <field name="fulltext">I am pleased to have the pre- viledge in life to address this letter to you -&amp; while I am having it pened , I feel truly sensible of the good providence of God in pre- serving me with health &amp; strength &amp; a sound disposal to write. I feel sensible how pleased you will be to hear from me as well as other friends at my old home &amp; I pray the Lord that all of you are well &amp; doing well. One so far off as I am—it may appear upon imagination that I am almost out of the World. We are all well &amp; myself &amp; wife join in love to you. Your letter afforded me much pleasure be cause it imparted satisfactory intelligence about my children. Myself and daughter have the fever slightly but never laid up a day. My wife have not been laid up a day neither. David has not been sick at all Poor Thomas is dead. He followed his old habbits of running about, he went away from home, and spent some time, and re turned with the fever lived 8 days and died Mary is well and hearty, a very fine girld and industrious. Her mother suffered much with the fever at Clay Ashland -but has improved considerable. We are living &amp; do as well as we can—and we are much pleased with our home &amp; country. Though should you &amp; I live, I expect in a few years to see you again &amp; should we not live—pray God that we may meet in heaven.</field>
