      <field name="fulltext">ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. For admission to any department of the University, the general conditions are the following: 1. Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years; the faculty advise seventeen or more. Nineteen years is the minimum for admission to the Department of Law. 2. Good Character.âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation.âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the requirements for admission to the several departments of the University. For admission to the College, the candidate must present a certificate or pass an equivalent examination. In either case the amount of preparation required is measured in terms of units. A unit represents a year's study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year's work. This definition of a unit takes the four-year high-school course as a basis and assumes that the length of the school year is from thirty-six to forty weeks, that a period is from forty to sixty minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year's work in any subject cannot be accomplished in less than one hundred and twenty hours, or their equivalent. For the requirements as to the number and selection of the units required for entrance, see, for the College, page 63. ADMISSION BY CERTIFICATE. For admission by certificate, the applicant should file with the Dean of the University not later than September 1 a Certificate of Preparation, made out on the blank form furnished by the University. This certificate must come from a recognized institution of collegiate rank, from an accredited public high school, or from an accredited private secondary school. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory high-school work of standard grade, covering at least fifteen entrance units. In every case the candidate for admission must make at least the grade required by the School for College Certification, and must have the recommendation of the principal of the certifying school. The university accredits all four year public high schools and all private secondary schools which are fully accredited by the State Board of Education of Virginia. The Dean of the University is further authorized to accept certificates from schools outside Virginia, accredited by their own state universities or institutions of equal rank, or by their own state departments of education, provided the courses of study offered in such schools meet the requirements demanded of accredited schools in this state. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases take the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION. For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the honor system, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge. All candidates who take their examinations at the times appointed are tested free of charge. In case of delayed entrance, where the grounds of postponement are good, the President of the University may admit the candidate to a special examination, for which a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee is payable in advance, and is in no case returned. PROGRAM OF ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS. June, 1925 9-11 A. M. 11 A. M.-1 P. M. 3-5 P. M.

      <field name="fulltext">REGULATIONS. REGISTRATION. Registration of New Students.âApplicants seeking admission to the University for the first time must present themselves to the Dean of the University at some time during the first three days of the session. Registration of Matriculated Students.âStudents who have previously been matriculated as members of the University must present themselves to the deans of their respective departments upon one of the first three days of the session. Delayed Registration.âAny student who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will not be admitted unless he can explain his delay in a manner satisfactory to the President, and will be charged a delayed registration fee. Admission to the College during the Session.âNo applicant for admission to the College who has not been previously registered therein will be admitted after the middle of the first term, unless the Committee on Entrance Requirements is satisfied that, in view of his record, he is likely to prove successful with the work undertaken in spite of the handicap of late entrance. Registration after the Christmas Recess.âOn the first week-day after the Christmas Recess, every student is required to register by attending all the classes or laboratory exercises at which he is due that day. No further formality is necessary. Any student failing to register thus will be required to pay the delayed registration fee, and will be liable to whatever penalties may be imposed by his professors for unexcused absences. But if the delay is due to illness or other providential cause, the dean is authorized to remit the fee and to notify the professors concerned that the student's absences have been satisfactorily explained. RESIDENCE AND ATTENDANCE. The Academic Year begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September and continues for thirty-nine weeks. Thanksgiving Day and Jefferson Day are holidays, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the last week-day before the twenty-third of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of holidays, unless he has received written permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before the close of the session. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises in the courses which he pursues, or else suffer such penalties as his professors may impose for unexcused absences. Leave of Absence from the University is granted for sufficient reason by the dean of the department in which the student is registered, and must in every case be obtained in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or other student organizations on excursions will not be granted except to the officers and members of these organizations. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of the athletic teams are found on page 69. The same regulations apply, mutatis matandis to members of other student organizations. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University and the dean of the department in which the student is registered. For the conditions governing the return of fees upon withdrawal, see page 68. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the several departmental faculties for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also the regulations as to the delinquent students in the various departments. Absence from Examinations.âWritten examinations are an essential part of the work of every course in the University, and attendance upon them is required of every student. Absence may be excused only on the ground of sickness on the day of the examination (attested by a physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause which may be approved by the several faculties of the University. Special Examinations are granted only upon prompt application therefor, and in case the applicant's absence from the regular examination has been excused. See the preceding paragraph. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System, and an unpledged paper is counted as a total failure. In matters of class standing as well, students are expected to regard themselves as governed by the law of honor. CONDUCT. The laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the University precincts or not. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University any student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. The President will dismiss from the University every student convicted of public drunkenness. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the university grounds is forbidden. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. DORMITORIES AND BOARD. Dormitories.âStudents may reside in the University dormitories, in their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. The President will withdraw from the approved list any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. For rules governing the rental and occupancy of university dormitories, and the rates charged for the same, see page 18. For list of private lodging houses, with rates, apply to the Bursar. Board.âStudents may board at the University Cafeteria, at their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. For cost of board at the Cafeteria, see page 18. For list of private boarding houses, with rates, apply to the Bursar. MEDICAL ATTENDANCE AND PHYSICAL TRAINING. Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, treatment of the eye, ear, nose and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right of medical attendance. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. Physical Training.âNo student is permitted to undertake an amount of work greater than he may reasonably be expected to carry without detriment to his health; and every student is advised to take a due amount of daily outdoor exercise, for which ample opportunities are afforded by the athletic fields, the tennis courts, the golf course, and elsewhere; and, in addition, to make systematic use of the facilities afforded without cost for definite and judicious physical training at the gymnasium under the advice and instruction of the director and his assistants. For the regular course in Physical Training with credit value toward academic degrees, see page 57.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EXPENSES Payment of Fees.âWhen the aggregate charge for University fee, tuition fee, laboratory fees and room rent does not exceed $50 for the session, the total amount shall be paid upon registration. If said fees aggregate more than $50, but do not exceed $100, one-half thereof shall be paid upon registration and the remainder at the beginning of the second term. When the fees aggregate more than $100, payment shall be made one-third upon registration; one-third at the opening of the second term and the remainder at the opening of the third term. If any payment remain unpaid for fifteen days after the date on which it is due, the Bursar shall immediately notify the Dean of the department in which such student is entered of the delinquency, and such student shall by him be required to at once cease attending lectures, using laboratories, library, gymnasium, athletic grounds or buildings, boarding at the dining hall, and making use of any other privileges as a student until his financial relations with the University have been arranged satisfactorily with the Bursar. Return of Fees.âA student withdrawing within five days after registering shall have his fees refunded in full, except the sum of $5 to cover cost of registration, and his name shall be stricken from the rolls. If he withdraw or is dropped from the rolls for any cause after the fifth day of the term and before the middle thereof, his fees shall be returned pro rata. If he withdraw or is dropped from the rolls for any cause after the middle of the term no refund shall be made for the respective term, except in case of sickness when the refund shall be pro-rated upon certificate of the University Physician or other reputable medical practitioner. In any case a minimum charge of $5 shall be made to cover cost of registration. Laboratory fees shall be refunded upon statement of professor in charge except where the withdrawal is within five days after registering. Regulation Concerning Registration as Virginia Student.âIn order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parent's be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; if he has attained his majority, it is necessary that he himself be domiciled here. One is domiciled in the State who is living in it at the time the application is made and has no intention of removing therefrom in the future, or who, though absent from the State, has not lost his former domicile by acquiring one elsewhere. No other person can honestly avail himself of this privilege. Superintendents and Teachers of Public Schools Exempt from Fees.â White male teachers and superintendents of the public schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Academic Schools of the University without payment of fees (except those charged in laboratory courses), upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the public schools of the State during the year. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send in their names to the President of the University not later than March 5. Ministers of Religion and Candidates for the Ministry.âMinisters of religion may attend any of the Academic Schools of the University without payment of the tuition fee. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet without aid the expenses of an education. UNIVERSITY CHARGES. University and Tuition Fees* * The university fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the library; to the privileges of the gymnasium, with baths, private lockers, etc., and the advice and aid of the physical training staff and to free medical attendance by the University Physician in case of illness. It also covers all regular examination and diploma fees. College students from Virginia taking a single technical course in the Department of Engineering pay a tuition of $30, or $10 per term. The College: VIRGINIANS NON-VIRGINIANS University fee $ 40.00 $ 60.00 Tuition 160.00 Laboratory Fees. The College: Architecture B1, B2 and B3 (each) $30.00 Art B2, B3 and C1 (each) 5.00 Astronomy B3 5.00 Biology (each course) 10.00 Botany (each course) 10.00 Geology B1 3.00 Geology B3 and B4 (each) 5.00 â  â  In Chemistry a deposit of $5 is required in addition, to cover breakage of apparatus. Chemistry (each course) 20.00 Physics 1, B1, C1 and C2 (each) 15.00 ZoÃ¶logy (each course) 10.00 BOARD AND LODGING. A student may rent a room in one of the university dormitories and take his meals either in the University Cafeteria or in an approved private boarding house; or he may take both room and board in such boarding house, in which case he pays no room-rent or servant-hire to the University. A list of private boarding and lodging houses, with rates, may be had upon application to the Bursar. The University Cafeteria. The University Commons, conveniently situated near the center of the University, is now being conducted on the Cafeteria plan, with accommodations for seating three hundred students at one time. Good, wholesome food is being served at costs ranging from $20 to $30 per month. Many of the students are finding it possible to board at the lower rate. University Dormitories. Rules.âStudent desiring rooms should apply to the Bursar, enclosing a reservation fee of $5, which will be returned should there be no room to let. Rates.âThe rates stated below are for furnished room. If occupied by one student, the following furniture is provided: 1 three-piece enameled iron bed with comfortable springs and mattress, 1 chiffonier or dresser, 1 table, one straight chair and one rocking chair or morris chair. If occupied by two students, the following furniture is provided: 2 single beds, or 1 double deck bed with springs and mattresses, 1 chiffonier or dresser, 1 desk or two tables, 1 rocking chair or morris chair and two straight chairs. Additional furniture may be rented if desired. All rooms are heated by hot water and lighted by electricity. The student should bring bed linen, towels, blankets, pillow, etc., or they can be purchased here if desired. The rates given are for the session of nine months. The occupant of a room may reserve it for the next session by applying to the Bursar and depositing $5 not later than May 1. No room may be sublet without the consent of the Bursar.

The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here university and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. For each department three estimates are givenâ a low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundry âin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the low estimate.

While it is difficult for any student to be assured of remunerative work before he reaches the University, information as to such employment may be had from the secretary of the Committee on Student Self-Help, Madison Hall. For Loan Funds for deserving students, see page 28.</field>

At present researches are under way in the laboratory in the fields of catalysis; adsorption; organic equilibria; ionic equilibria; photochemistry; colloid chemistry; rate of flow of gases; organic synthesis, and other problems in organic chemistry. The Chemical Journal Club will meet once a week (hour to be arranged) for the critical review and discussion of various topics of interest in current chemical literature and of such chemical researches as are in progress in the University. All members of the teaching staff and advanced students in chemistry are expected to participate in these meetings and to take part in the discussions. The privileges of the club are extended to all members of the University and others who are interested in the progress of Chemistry. The Chemical Laboratory, recently completed, is of brick, fire-proof construction, and the three floors afford 30,000 square feet of space. The seven larger laboratories will accommodate 625 students, and, in addition to these there are smaller laboratories for the use of the instructors and advanced students. There are also rooms for assay furnaces, gas and water analysis, photography, etc. The equipment is satisfactory for purposes of both instruction and research. The laboratory maintains a working library containing about 4,000 volumes directly relating to chemistry as well as complete files of the more important periodicals. Requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy: In addition to fulfilling the regular University requirements for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy, candidates for this degree who select chemistry as their Major Subject must give evidence of thorough training in the general principles of chemistry, in organic chemistry, and in analytical chemistry, by passing written qualifying examinations in these subjects; these examinations to be passed not later than the close of the session preceding that in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred.

Geological Seminary: Review and discussion of the more important current geological literature, and the preparation of papers on special subjects based on field and library investigations. All instructors and advanced students in geology are expected to take part in the discussions at these meetings. Time to be arranged. The Lewis Brooks Museum contains collections illustrating the main subdivisions of natural history. Each of the collections is arranged so as to exemplify the principles of the science, and at the same time offers a large variety of subjects for advanced study. In geology the specimens show the different kinds of rocks, classified according to mineral character and the formations in which they occur, the collections of fossils, plaster casts, maps, etc., are exceptionally fine, and fully illustrate historical geology. In mineralogy the principles of the science are made plain by well-chosen suits of specimens, models of crystals, etc. The general collection of minerals contains all the important species, and many of the rarer ones, in good specimens. In addition to the above, a beginning has been made of a collection to illustrate the geology and mineralogy of the State of Virginia, and this is being increased as rapidly as possible.

The general requirements for admission to the University may be found on page 10. For admission to the College, the candidate should possess an amount of preparation which is at least the equivalent of that represented by four years of successful work in an accredited school. He must offer, either by certificate or by examination (see page 10), fifteen units, of which three must be in English, two and one-half in Mathematics (one and one-half in algebra, one in plane geometry), and one in History. The remaining eight and one-half units may be selected at will from the list on page 12, but no credit will be given for less than two units in any foreign language. Candidates who expect to apply for the degree of B.S. in Architecture should offer Solid Geometry and Physics if possible. Candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Chemistry should offer Science B (Inorganic Chemistry) and Mathematics C (Solid Geometry), when possible. In addition to the above, each candidate must pass at the University a qualifying examination in English before his registration can be completed. This examination will be held on the Tuesday of the first week of the session. Advanced Standing is given to any candidate who, in addition to meeting the minimum requirements for entrance above stated, can show by passing an examination given sometime during the first month of his first session that he has done work equivalent to that covered by any of the following courses offered in the college: Latin A1, Greek A1, Greek A2, English A1 or A2 or A3, German A1, Mathematics A1, French A, Spanish A. Candidates who apply for examination for advanced standing must present a special certificate showing that the full content of the course, on which advanced standing is sought, has been covered in a systematic manner in the preparatory school, and in addition must present the specific recommendation of the principal of the school that the candidate be admitted to the advanced standing examination in question. This examination will be held on the Tuesday of the week during which entrance examinations are held. College Credit.âCandidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges, must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Department a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of not less than 12 session-hours of work during his first session. In no case will credit be given on more than forty-five session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining fifteen session-hours required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the College, exclusive of any credit for work done in the Summer Quarter or in any of the professional departments. In every case the candidate must spend the last session of his candidacy, which must be a regular session of nine months, exclusively in college work in this university; and the courses offered as major electives must all have been completed in residence in this university. A maximum of 15 session-hours may be granted for one year of college work, and 33 hours for two years. Conditioned Students.âA candidate for entrance must offer fifteen units as defined by the Southern Commission on Accredited Schools. At least thirteen of the units offered must be included in the list of units accepted for admission on page 109. A student who, while able to offer fifteen units, cannot offer fifteen units as defined in this list, may be conditioned on any two units not including English A, B, or C, or Mathematics A1. All conditions should be absolved before the beginning of the session following initial registration. This may be done by passing entrance examinations or by passing equivalent courses in the Summer Quarter. But no course taken to remove a condition may be counted as part of the work credited toward a degree. No conditioned student may be later registered as a special student. Special Students.âA candidate may be admitted as a special student without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided that, if he is a Virginian, he is more than twenty years old or, if he is not a Virginian, he is more than twenty-three years old, on the day of registration, and gives adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up their deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the Summer Quarter. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. Admission of Women.âWomen are admitted as candidates for the vocational degrees of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, Bachelor of Science in Architecture and Bachelor of Science in Commerce. A candidate must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present certificates showing graduation from an accredited public high-school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private school, with credit for not less than fifteen college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for fifteen entrance units, of at least thirty session-hours, (sixty semester-hours), of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. REGULATIONS. (1) The Session-Hour.âAll courses are measured in terms of the session-hour as a unit. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work. (2) Maximum and Minimum Number of Session-Hours.âEach College student is required to undertake each session courses aggregating at least fifteen session-hours (with the exception noted under Probation below). This number may be increased in the following cases: (I) Any first-year student may take eighteen session-hours, provided he is credited with six session-hours of advanced standing. (II) A student not in his first year in the College may take eighteen session-hours, provided he (a) has passed in the preceding session or in the third term thereof courses aggregating fifteen session-hours, or (b) is in his graduating year and needs eighteen session-hours for his degree. (III) A student not in his first year may take twenty-one session-hours provided he passed in the preceding session or in the third term thereof courses aggregating eighteen session-hours. (IV) Any student whose term grade (or class grade, if the term grade is not available) for the first or second term is at least 75 per cent. in each of his courses, may take three additional session-hours for the ensuing term. Exceptions to the above regulations will be allowed only by special permission of the Committee on Rules and Courses. Physical Training is not counted in the maximum and minimum requirements detailed above. (3) Grade.âThe grade of a college student in course either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. For passing in any course in the college a grade of seventy-five cent is required. (4) Exclusion from Courses, Probation and Suspension. (I) Exclusion from Courses: A student who, after due admonition, is evidently making no real progress in a course, may, at any time during the session, be excluded from the course by the Dean upon the recommendation of the instructor concerned. A student whose term grade in a course is less than 50 per cent., or who discontinues the course without the permission of the Dean, or who is absent without excuse from the term examination, will be automatically excluded from the course. Any student receiving a grade of less than 65 per cent. in English A1, A2, or A3 in the first or second term, must drop the course and take up English A4 at the beginning of the ensuing term. (II) Probation: (1) A student placed on 15-hour probation must pass on at least 6 session-hours of his work and average at least 60 per cent. on all his courses, or else be suspended from the College. A student placed on 15-hour probation who attains an average grade of at least 70 per cent. on all his courses, is absolved from probation. (2) A student placed on 12-hour probation must pass on at least 6 session-hours of his work and average at least 65 per cent. on all his courses, or else be suspended from the College. A student on 12-hour probation whose average grade on all his courses is at least 75 per cent., may take up 3 additional session-hours and be absolved from probation. (3) A student on 9-hour probation must pass on 6 session-hours of his work and average at least 70 per cent. on all his courses, or else be suspended from College. A student on 9-hour probation whose average grade on all his courses is at least 75 per cent., may take up 3 additional session-hours and be placed on 12-hour probation for the term next ensuing. A student on 9-hour probation who passes on all his courses may take up 6 additional session-hours and be absolved from probation. (III) Suspension: Suspension means enforced withdrawal from the College. If imposed during the session, it applies to the remainder of the regular session; if imposed at the end of the session; it applies to the whole of the subsequent session. In no case does it apply to the Summer Quarter. See also (6) below. No student suspended for a second time may re-enter the College. (IV) Probation and Suspension are administered as follows: (1) A student who by exclusion from a course or courses is left at the end of the first or second term with only 12 session-hours, is put on 12-hour probation* * Or 15-hour probation for a student excluded from English A1, A2, or A3, and thereby forced to take up English A4. for the term next ensuing, unless his average grade on the remaining 12 session-hours is at least 75 per cent. In this case he may take up 3 additional session-hours and escape probation. (2) A student who by exclusion from a course or courses is left at the end of the first or second term with only 9 session-hours, (a) will be put on 9-hour probation,â  â  Or 12-hour probation for a student excluded from English A1, A2, or A3, and thereby forced to take up English A4. unless his average grade on his remaining 9 session-hours is at least 75 per cent., in which case he may take up 3 additional session-hours and be put on 12-hour probation, or, (b) if he be other than a first-year student he will be suspended unless he has passed on at least 3 session-hours. (3) Any student not in his first year, who by exclusion from a course or courses is left at any time during the session with only 6 session-hours, will be suspended at the end of the term. Any first-year student left with only 6 session-hours will be suspended at the end of the term unless he has passed on at least 3 session-hours. In this case he will be required to take up 3 additional session-hours and be put on 9-hour probation for the ensuing term. (4) Any student not on probation who fails to attain a third-term grade or a session grade of at least 75 per cent. on at least 9 session-hours of his work, will be put on 15-hour probation for the first term of the subsequent session. A student who is permitted to withdraw from the University during the session will be readmitted on 15-hour probation if, at the time of his withdrawal, he was (a) on probation, or (b) passing on less than 9 session-hours of his work. A student previously suspended will, if re-admitted to the College, be placed on 15-hour probation. (5) No student may remain on probation for more than three terms, whether consecutive or not, in his entire college course. If his record is such as to call for the imposition of probation for a fourth time, he will be suspended instead of being placed on probation. (6) Probation or suspension imposed at the end of the regular session may be absolved by the successful completion of prescribed work in the Summer Quarter. (7) No student on probation may receive a leave of absence, except for imperative cause, nor may such a student be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as athletic teams, musical clubs, student publications, etc. (5) Absence from Examinations will not be excused, except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. A student excused from more than one-half of his term examinations on account of illness may not be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as the athletic teams, musical clubs, student publications, etc., until he has passed his examinations. No student may remain in the College if he misses all the examinations of two consecutive terms on account of illness. (6) Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, in accordance with (5) above, is entitled to a special examination on a date during the regular session to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge of the examination. (7) Re-Examinations.â(I) A College student whose session grade in any course falls below seventy-five per cent., but not below sixty-five per cent., may, upon the written recommendation of the professor in charge, be admitted to re-examination upon that course, or upon such portion of it as the professor shall determine, during the registration week of the following September. The fee for each re-examination is five dollars, and it should be paid to the Bursar on or before July fifteenth. (II) The candidate for the academic degree who fails on only one of his courses during his final session of candidacy is entitled to a special reexamination on the work of that course before the final day, provided that he average at least 65 per cent on the work of the three terms, and provided the professor in charge recommends that the candidate be granted a re-examination. The professor in charge is to decide whether the candidate is to stand a re-examination upon the whole course, or upon some portion or portions of the course. No fee is charged for such re-examination. It should be carefully noted, in connection with both (I) and (II) above, that no student is entitled to more than one re-examination on a given course without repeating the course. (8) Reports.âReports are sent at the end of each term to the parent or guardian of each College student. These reports indicate the number of times the student has been absent from lectures, and give his term grade on each course. The dean will be glad at any time to furnish to the proper person a special report on any student's standing. In addition to the above, a report on the standing of each first year student in the College is sent to the student's parent or guardian early in November. (9) Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or not. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. The president will dismiss from the University every student convicted of public drunkenness. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the University grounds is forbidden. (10) Voluntary Withdrawal.âVoluntary withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University as well as the consent of the student's parent or guardian, if he is a minor. Any student who withdraws without permission will be recorded as having been suspended for the residue of the current session. No student on probation may withdraw except for imperative reasons; and any student on probation who withdraws without permission will be suspended, not only for the residue of the current session, but also for the whole of the subsequent session. (11) Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also suspension, above. (12) Change of Studies.âNo change can be made in a student's program of studies except with the written consent of the Dean, together with official notification by the Registrar. No permit for change of courses will be issued after the end of the first week of each term, except that first-year students may make such changes within the first two weeks after the beginning of lectures in September. Any student who drops a course without permission will receive a grade of zero in that course; and no credit may be received for any portion of a course attended before formal permission has been granted as outlined above. (13) (a) Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like providential cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made on the day of the first lecture attended after the absence. Unexcused absence from lectures renders the student liable to discipline by the Faculty. It should be carefully noted that no student is "entitled" to be absent at all. His presence is required at each class or laboratory exercise at which he is due, unless his absence is excused for reasons outlined above or in the next paragraph below. Even if the student is absent with excuse, he must make up the work lost by such absence. No student who was, for any reason, absent from more than fifty per cent. of the lectures of any one term, can receive a grade on the work of that term. (b) Absence from the University is permitted upon the written leave of the dean, and should in every case be obtained in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of these organizations. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of the athletic teams are found in the General Catalogue. The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. No student on Probation may receive a leave of absence except for imperative cause. It should also be carefully noted that no leave of absence can be granted just before or just after a vacation, or just after term exeminations, except for very grave reasons, or unless the applicant is passing in all his courses. (14) The Dean's List.âAny student who passed on not less than fifteen hours in a given session with an average of at least eighty-five per cent., and with no session grade less than seventy-five per cent., is placed on the Dean's List, and remains on the list as long as he receives no term grade less than seventy-five per cent. If a student on the Dean's List receives a term grade less than seventy-five per cent., he is automatically dropped from the List. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting the issuance of leaves of absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. Full opportunity is given to any student to carry out any definite plan of work which he may have in view on coming to the University, or which may have been prescribed for him by those under whose direction he is completing his education. But when no well-considered plan has been outlined in advance, and the end in view is that for which the great majority of students enter college, namely, the attainment of a liberal education, the student will be expected to enter upon regular work of the college leading to a baccalaureate degree. Five degrees are offered candidates for graduation in the College. Two of these, the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science, are cultural; the Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed on the diploma, the Bachelor of Science in Architecture, and the Bachelor of Science in Commerce, are vocational degrees, designed for those who wish to fit themselves especially for professional work. No course offered by a successful candidate for one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees can be offered by the same candidate as part of the work credited toward the other cultural baccalaureate degree, nor can any work done to remove an entrance condition be counted for any degree. For a student who enters without advanced standing the normal time required for obtaining a baccalaureate degree is four years, assuming that he completes each year courses which aggregate the regular minimum of fifteen session-hours. A student receiving advanced standing in not less than two subjects may obtain a degree in three years, provided he is able to complete each year eighteen session-hours. A student may materially shorten the time required for obtaining a degree by taking courses in the Summer Quarter for which college credit is given. For credit for work done at other colleges, see page 63. The requirements for the baccalaureate degrees are such as to allow a large measure of freedom of election on the part of the individual student, such restriction only being placed upon this liberty as is necessary to insure at the same time the thoroughness and the breadth of culture for which these degrees stand. In order to secure to the recipient of a degree a due measure of acquaintance with the methods of thought characteristic of each of the leading departments of knowledge, as well as with their subject matter, his courses must be chosen subject to the specific requirements detailed below. BACHELOR OF ARTS AND BACHELOR OF SCIENCE. The degree of Bachelor of Arts or of Bachelor of Science, respectively, will be conferred upon regular students who have completed not less than sixty (60) session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the following programme: (1) Required Subjects.âCandidates for either cultural degree must take 30 hours of required subjects as stated below and must in addition, unless exemption is granted on a physician's certificate, complete the two years' course in Physical Training which is not evaluated in session-hours (see below). Of the 30 hours of required subjects not less than 24 hours must be taken during the first two years, and the remaining 6 hours not later than the third year. Foreign Languages. For the Bachelor of Arts.âNine session-hours from two languages, of which six must be in either Latin or Greek. For the Bachelor of Science.âNine session-hours from two languages, of which six must be in either French, German or Spanish. Mathematics. For either degree.âThree session-hours. Natural Science. For either degree.âSix session-hours. English. For either degree.âSix session-hours, 3 of which may be in Biblical History, or Biblical Literature, or Public Speaking, the other 3 being in English or English Literature. Social Science. For either degree.âThree session-hours in History B1 or B2, or Economics B1, or Government B1. Economics B1, if selected, cannot be taken before the candidate's second year. Philosophy. For either degree.âThree session-hours in Philosophy B1, Philosophy B2, or Psychology B1. Physical Training. For either degree.âTwo years' course required of all candidates, which must be completed before graduation. If not completed during the first two years, an additional study-course of 3 session-hours must be taken. In this case, the candidate must offer 63 hours, exclusive of Physical Training, for the degree. A candidate entering with advanced standing or with college credit shall in his first, and, if necessary, continuously in subsequent sessions, take such courses as are necessary to complete these requirements for the first and second sessions. (2) Electives-at-large.âOf the remaining 30 session-hours required by the baccalaureate degree, 18 session-hours may be elected from any courses in the academic schools for which the candidate has adequate preparation. (3) Major-Electives.âThe remaining 12 session-hours required for either degree, shall be known as Major-Electives. The Major-Electives shall include at least one C course, and must all be offered from some one of the following Major-Groups of related subjects, except that when the Major-Group is Group III, the candidate may offer, in lieu of a C course, any six-hour B course in this Group, for admission to which another six-hour B course in the Group is prerequisite. The Major-Electives must all be completed in this College or in some professional department of this university. Group I.âLanguages, Literature, Fine Arts, and Music. Group II.âSocial and Philosophical Sciences. Group III.âMathematical and Natural Sciences. (4) Substitutions for Major-Electives.âThe first-year course in Law, or the first-year course in Medicine or 12 session-hours of technical courses in one of the professional departments of Engineering or Education may be substituted for the 12 session-hours of Major-Electives in academic subjects. This work, which must be completed in one of the professional departments of this University, cannot be begun by the candidate until he has spent at least 2 sessions of 9 months each in successful work in this College, and has at least 45 session-hours to his credit. DEGREES WITH HONORS. The courses required for the cultural B.A. and B.S. degrees are adapted to the powers of the average student, and any graduate of an accredited school, who has, either by certificate or examination satisfied the requirements for admission to the College, if he is reasonably industrious and regular in his studies, should obtain one of these degrees without difficulty in four sessions' work. In every body of students, however, there is a varying proportion of men and women who possess greater ability and application than the average, and whose ambition aims higher than a bare pass-mark on their work. For the proper stimulation of such students toward the best that they can do, and for due and authoritative recognition of unusual ability and high achievement in studies, the Academic Faculty has instituted the following system of Special Honors. Intermediate Honors. A certificate of Intermediate Honors is conferred by the Academic Faculty on the student who, during his first two regular sessions in the College of this University, has passed on not less than 30 session-hours, including all required A courses, without failure or re-examination on any course, and with an average grade on all courses of 85 per cent. or more. The holder of a Certificate of Intermediate Honors, so long as he has no grade below 75 per cent. on the work of any term in any course, is not subject to any of the rules limiting the issuance of leaves of absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty affecting class-standing imposed for absence alone. The Certificates of Intermediate Honors are publicly conferred at the Annual Convocation of the University following the session in which the honors have been attained. The names of the holders of these certificates are published under a separate heading in the annual catalogue of the University. Final Honors. Final Honors are conferred only on graduation, and the diploma of B.A. or B.S. with Final Honors states that the graduate has obtained special honors, and the subjects in which honors were won. A student who wishes to obtain Final Honors must be accepted as a candidate for honors two sessions before graduation. Any holder of the Certificate of Intermediate Honors, or any student who has credit for not less than 30 session-hours, including all required A courses, passed in this college or elsewhere, and who satisfies the Special Committee on Honors of his capacity for superior work, may become a candidate for Final Honors. The candidate for Final Honors, in addition to completing, without failure in any course, the regular degree requirements not later than the end of his second year of candidacy, will, before graduation, take a special comprehensive examination, oral or written, for Final Honors in some one group of subjects, selected by him at the beginning of his candidacy from the list of such groups published by the Special Committee on Honors. Final Honors are conferred on the basis of the standing on this examination alone, and not of the grades obtained in any or all of the courses required for the baccalaureate degree. Students who have credit for 30 session-hours and who are interested in Final Honors, are urged to consult the temporary Chairman of the Committee on Honors, Professor W. H. Faulkner, before registering. BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN A SPECIAL SUBJECT. The degree of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject will be conferred upon regular students who have completed not less than sixty-three (63) session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the following programme: (1) Required Subjects: Candidates must complete 33 session-hours of required subjects as stated below, of which 3 must be in Physical Training B1. Of the remaining 30 session-hours of required subjects not less than 24 must be taken during the first two years, and the remaining 6 not later than the third year. Foreign Languages: 6 session-hours, of which 3 must be in French and 3 in German. Mathematics: 6 session-hours.â  â  Students applying for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Biology may substitute Biology C1 for 3 hours of Mathematics; students applying for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Geology may be permitted, at the discretion of the professor of geology, to substitute Astronomy B1 for 3 hours of Mathematics. Natural Science: 12 session-hours in 2 subjects. English: 6 session-hours, of which 3 must be in English B3. Physical Training: 3 session-hours, which must be completed during the first two years. A candidate entering with advanced standing or with college credit, shall in his first, and, if necessary, continuously in subsequent sessions, take such courses as are necessary to complete the requirements for the first and second sessions. (2) Major-Electives: 30 session-hours. At least two years before the date of graduation, the candidate must select one of the schools of the Natural or Mathematical Sciences as his Major School, and during the remainder of his candidacy must pursue work in that School, with such other courses as shall be prescribed by the professor or professors in charge of his Major School and approved by the Academic Faculty. BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN ARCHITECTURE. Candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Architecture must complete 63 session-hours as listed below. To complete the work required for the degree in four years from entrance, students without advanced standing or college credit should adhere closely to the following programme in choosing their courses. It is strongly urged, however, that those students who can do so should devote an additional year to study for the degree, taking other cultural and scientific subjects, such as foreign languages, history and chemistry. Unless Solid Geometry and Physics are offered for entrance, these subjects must be made up in addition to the required 63 session-hours. Normal Four-Year Program for the B.S. in Architecture.
