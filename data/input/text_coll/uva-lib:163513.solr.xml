      <field name="fulltext">COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. In establishing the University of Virginia, Mr. Jefferson, for the first time in America, threw open the doors of a University, providing for thorough instruction in Independent Schools in the chief branches of learning. The system assumes that the opportunities it presents are privileges to be voluntarily and eagerly sought, and it therefore allows students to elect for themselves the departments to which they are led by their individual tastes and proposed pursuits in life. This freedom of election commends itself particularly to those who desire to make special attainments in some one department of knowledge. At the same time the courses of academical study are so arranged as to provide for the systematic prosecution of a complete plan of general education. The wisdom of the founder has been amply vindicated by time and experience; and of late many institutions of higher education in the United States have, to a greater or less extent, remodeled their methods in accordance with this example. The Courses of Instruction are Academical and Professional. The former are comprised in two departments, the Literary and the Scientific; the latter, in the four Departments of Medicine, Law, Engineering, and Agriculture. In the various Departments there are altogether nineteen distinct Schools, each affording an independent course under a Professor, who gives the instruction, generally by lectures, and conducts the examinations, and who alone is responsible for its system and methods. Among these Schools, without regard to the Departments, the student is at liberty to elect those he may wish to attend, limited only in respect of lectures occurring at the same hours, and by a regulation concerning the number of Schools to be attended by academical students.</field>

Essays are required at regular intervals. Lectures on each subject are given in connection with the text-books. Text-Books.âA. S. Hill's Principles of Rhetoric; Morley and Tyler's Manual of English Literature; Ward's English Poets. Each class meets twice a week, and may be attended separately; but graduation in I. and III., or II. and III., will be necessary for a diploma in the School. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF HISTORICAL SCIENCE. Prof. Holmes. In this School are two classesâone of General History, the other of the Processes of Historical Change. Either class may be taken separately. I. In the class of General History the story of advancing civilization is followed through the succession of the leading nations, from the commencement of authentic history to the Age of Revolution still in progress.

School of Latin.âA class is formed of students who have graduated in the School, and who desire a wider acquaintance with Latin than is implied in graduation. Authors not embraced in the regular course are read and closely studied. Special attention is given to translation, and a prominent feature of the lecture-room exercises is the discussion by members of the class of the text translated. The vocabulary acquired by extensive translation is frequently applied in rendering into Latin passages of English selected for the purpose. School of Greek.âThis course is designed primarily for students who are making a professional study of Greek philology. With such students the Professor will read and discuss the more difficult Greek authors. Extensive courses of reading are marked out, including important text-books in English, Latin, German, and French. Incessant practice is given in Greek composition. From time to time papers (in English or Latin), upon topics selected by each student for himself, are required as evidence of power to do original work. Competent students who do not seek distinction at the examination of this course, but simply desire to enlarge their knowledge of Greek Literature, will be guided in their reading, and regularly instructed by the Professor. LITERARY DEPARTMENT. School of Modern Languages.âGraduates and others who may wish to continue the study of any one of the modern languages or of Anglo-Saxon beyond the limits of the under graduate course, or who may aim at attaining the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, will in this School read additional authors in the language selected, study the Science of Language, and be trained to write essays, giving proof of original research. To do this successfully a certain amount of knowledge in the ancient, and at least of two modern languages, will be required. Candidates for honors will be given the choice between pursuing the study of linguistique with the help of such works as Hovelacque's, Diez', Sayce's and others, or of thoroughly studying one or more idioms from their origin to the period of highest perfection. They will thus be led to compare the languages belonging to certain families, like the Romance, Germanic or Slavic, either with each other, or with other families, according to their lexical or psychological peculiarities. School of English.âIn this School two separate graduate courses will be arranged to suit the needs of those students who desire to pursue further either philological or literary studies. The former will comprise the further study of Anglo-Saxon and Early English works, especially Anglo-Saxon poetry, or the study of Gothic and the comparative grammar of the Teutonic languages. The latter will comprise the study of some distinctive period in English literature, or of some particular writer, or writers, including the political, social, and literary characteristics of the age under consideration. In each course a thesis will be required, giving evidence of independent private study of some subject cognate with the course pursued, in addition to such examinations as may be advisable. School of Historical Science.âThe graduate course in this School for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy will be varied from year to year, but will always be designed to train the student in original research and systematic exposition of the results. Some historical period, with the accompanying social, political and intellectual development of the people, will be made the subject of study. Such instructions and directions as may be required to render these pursuits efficacious will be given throughout the session. School of Moral Philosophy.âThe history of philosophy, ancient and modern, with a special study of Aristotle and Kant. N. B. Graduation in a School is prerequisite to admission to the advanced Graduate Course of that School. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. CHARLES S. VENABLE, LL. D., Professor of Mathematics. FRANCIS H. SMITH, M.

It embraces applications of the Differential and Integral Calculus to selected portions of Mechanics, Physics, and Physical Astronomy. There is one class in Mixed Mathematics. Text-book:âPrice's Infinitesimal Calculus, Vol. III., and some work on Physical Astronomy. The instruction in each class in the School of Mathematics is conveyed partly by lectures and partly by the systematic study of approved text-books. The progress of the student in each class is tested by his being required to perform written exercises, in which the principles acquired are applied to the solution of selected problems. Any student entering the School has the privilege of attending all or any of the classes, and if prepared to enter an advanced class, may often find it highly advantageous to review his previous studies by attendance on a lower class also. SCHOOL OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Prof. Smith. This School includes two courses, as follows: I. General Physics. Junior Class.âThe Junior Class meets three times in each week. The object of the course of lectures to this class is to furnish the student with a comprehensive view of modern Physics, and to make him familiar with its methods of investigation. With the design of laying a thoroughly scientific basis for the course, a large space is given at the outset to the discussion of the cardinal doctrines of motion, force, energy, and potential, and to their simpler applications in the pressure and motion of visible masses. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. With this preparation the student proceeds to the subject of Molecular Physics, embracing Sound, Light, Heat, and Electricity. Throughout the course the laws of motion and force are kept steadily in view, and an attempt is made to exhibit the evidence, daily becoming stronger and clearer, for the belief prevalent among scientists that the entire body of Physics is a coherent and harmonious system of mechanical truth. Text-books:âThe Professor's Syllabus; Everett's Units and Physical Constants. For reference:âTreatises by Clerk Maxwell; Jamin; Daguin. Senior Class.âThis class meets thrice each week, and studies Spherical Astronomy and selected portions of Mathematical Physics.

In this School are two courses, as follows: I. General Chemistry. The course consists of three lectures a week throughout the session. The fundamental ideas of chemical science, the relations of Chemistry to Physics, the laws regulating chemical combination by weight and by volume, the atomic theory as at present viewed in connection with Chemistry, the chemical nomenclature and symbols now in use, and a general survey of the descriptive chemistry of the elements and their compounds, inorganic and organic, are brought forward in order, with incidental allusion to the applications in medicine, the arts and manufactures, of the facts mentioned. Text-books:âFownes's Chemistry, (last edition.) For reference:âMiller's, or Roscoe &amp; Schorlemmer's Elements of Chemistry; A. Naquetâ"Principes de Chimie fondÃ©e sur les thÃ©ories modernes"; Watt's Dictionary of Chemistry. II. Industrial Chemistry. This course, in which also three lectures a week are delivered, investigates in detail the chemical principles and processes specially concerned in the more important arts and manufactures, upon which in large measure depends the development of the natural resources of the country, the opportunity being thus presented of preparation for such positions as those of the miner and metallurgist, the chemical manufacturer, the dyer, bleacher, tanner, sugar refiner, etc. Text-books:âWagner's Chemical Technology. For reference:âRichardson and Watt's Chemical Technology; Muspratt's Chemistry as Applied to Arts and Manufactures; Ure's Dictionary of Arts and Manufactures; Girardinâ"LeÃ§ons de Chimie ÃlÃ©mentaire appliquÃ©e aux Arts Industriels;" Percy's Metallurgy, etc. The lectures in both these courses are illustrated by suitable experiments, and by such specimens, models, drawings, etc., as the various subjects require. The collections of the University in illustration of the processes and products of Industrial Chemistry have been procured with much expense and pains in this country, England, France and Germany, and are unusually extensive and goodâamongst the best on this side of the Atlantic. (See page 55.) SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT.3 SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL AND AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. Prof. Dunnington. Instruction in this School is given in the two following courses: I. Analytical Chemistry. In this course, while the chief portion of the teaching is necessarily individual, there are three classes: The first class meets twice a week during the session, on each occasion spending from three to four hours in practical experiments in the laboratory. A course of practice in chemical manipulation is first pursued. This is followed by a systematic course of qualitative analysis, including blowpipe analysis and the elements of fire assaying. Toward the close of the session, the elements of quantitative analysis are taught as far as the limitation of time will permit. The second class, in addition to the work of the first class given above, pursues an extended course of quantitative analysis, determining the composition of ores, minerals, clays, soils, building-stones, manures, technical products, and like substances, and involving a full course of instruction in practical chemistry. Members of this class have access to the laboratory daily during working hours, and are assisted and encouraged to undertake original research. The third class is intended for students of medicine. (See page 38.) Among the works recommended to laboratory students are: Freseniusâ"Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis;" Greville Williamsâ"Handbook of Chemical Manipulation;" Woehlerâ"Examples for Practice in Chemical Analysis;" Von Kobellâ "Tafeln zur Bestimmung der Mineralien" (also in English translation); Odlingâ "Practical Chemistry for Medical Students;" A. Classenâ"Elementary Quantitative Analysis." Besides the above, there is a class in Practical Pharmacy, specially intended for medical students. (See page 38.) II. Agricultural Chemistry. In this course there is one class, to which lectures are delivered once a week throughout the session; or, when found more convenient to students of Agriculture, a larger number of lectures a week are given during a part of the year only. The chemical and physical properties of SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. soils, of the atmosphere, and of plants, the chemistry of the processes of vegetable life and growth, the composition and chemical preparation of manures, etc., are discussed. Text-books:âJ. F. W. Johnston and C. A. Cameronâ"Elements of Agricultural Chemistry and Geology" (12th edition). For reference:âS. W. Johnsonâ"How Crops Grow," and "How Crops Feed;" N. T. Luptonâ"Elementary Principles of Scientific Agriculture." Farmers who are not regular students of the University are invited to attend this special course without charge. Very liberal provision for this School has been made in the way of material arrangements. (See page 55.) CORCORAN SCHOOL OF NATURAL HISTORY AND GEOLOGY. Prof. Fontaine. In this School are three classes: Geology, Mineralogy, and Botany. I. Geology.âThis subject will be taught during the entire session, and three lectures a week will be devoted to it, until after the intermediate examination in Mineralogy, when five lectures a week are given. The aim of the course of instruction is to give as thorough an exposition of the fundamental principles of the science as possible, and to teach the student how to use them in practical work in the field. Text-books:âLe Conte's Elements of Geology. For reference:âDana's Manual, and Lyell's Elements and Principles of Geology. II. Mineralogy.âThis subject will be studied until the intermediate examination in February. Two lectures a week will be devoted to it. Special attention will be paid to crystallography, as well as to the chemical and physical properties of minerals. In Descriptive Mineralogy, the mode of occurrence, the geological importance and relations of the species will be made prominent. Text-books:âDana's Manual of Mineralogy and Lithology. For reference: Dana's Text-book of Mineralogy. III. Botany.âFor the present this subject is transferred to the School of Agriculture, Zoology and Botany. (See page 45.) SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. The excellent collections of geological, mineralogical, and botanical specimens in the Lewis Brooks Museum of Natural History (see page 54), afford unusual facilities for the study and illustration of the principles taught. The lectures on Geology and Mineralogy end the last of April, when field explorations begin, and continue two months. Persons engaged in the study of Geology and Mineralogy, though not members of the University class, can, with the leave of the Professor, and on paying $25 to the Proctor, join the exploring party. SCHOOL OF PRACTICAL ASTRONOMY. Prof. Stone. Besides the general fundamental principles of Spherical and Practical Astronomy and Celestial Mechanics, instruction in this School embraces the theory of meridian and equatorial instruments, and the instruments subsidiary thereto, the methods of determining time, latitude and longitude, the methods of determining right ascensions and declinations, the formation of star catalogues, the use and construction of ephemerides, the computation of elliptic and parabolic orbits and of special perturbations, together with the auxiliary subjects of interpolation, mechanical quadrature, and the method of least squares. Throughout the course systematic training is given in numerical computation, and in the use of astronomical instruments, and students are expected to engage in such original work as their time and attainments will permit. Only in exceptional cases will students be able to complete the course in less than two years. Text-books:âChauvenet's Spherical and Practical Astronomy; Oppolzer's Lehrbuch zur Bahnbestimmung; Gauss's Theoria Motus. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. GRADUATE COURSES. School of Mathematics.âThe graduate course will consist of selected studies in the Higher Algebra, Modern Higher Geometry, the Infinitesimal Calculus and some of its applications, or in the elements of Quaternions. School of Natural Philosophy.âFor graduate studies the reader is referred to the Course in Practical Physics, page 31. School of General and Industrial Chemistry.âThe principal part of the graduate course will consist of practical laboratory work on subjects of original investigation; advanced reading may also be prescribed, especially in the shape of the bibliography of particular topics, to be looked up from various sources and condensed by the student. School of Natural History and Geology.âIn this School no fixed course of study will be laid down for graduates. Subjects will be selected from one or more of the branches included in the School, and assigned to the students. As far as possible, original research will be required in the treatment of the subjects chosen. School of Practical Astronomy.âA prescribed course in this School, to be agreed upon in a conference of the Professors interested, will be considered as the equivalent of the Graduate Course in either Mathematics or Natural Philosophy for graduates of these schools. N. B.âGraduation in a School is prerequisite to admission to the advanced Graduate Course of that School. N. B.âStudents pursuing literary studies will, in many cases, find it advantageous to take the course in International and Constitutional Law, Prof. Gilmore, (page 41). Those pursuing scientific studies will, in many cases, find it advantageous to take the courses in Applied Mathematics, Prof. Thornton, (page 42); Physiology, Dr. Cabell, (page 38); and Zoology and Botany, Prof. Page, (page 45).</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. JAMES L. CABELL, M. D., M. A., LL. D., Professor of Physiology and Surgery. WILLIAM B. TOWLES, M. D., M. A., Acting Prof. of Anatomy and Materia Medica. JAMES F. HARRISON, M. D., Professor of Medicine, Obstetrics, etc. J. W. MALLET, M. D., Ph. D., F. R. S., Professor of Chemistry. DOUGLAS TARDY, M. D., Demonstrator of Anatomy. The Medical Department of the University aims at thorough work in its special province, to wit: the instruction of the student in the principles of medicine, and his discipline in the modes of acquiring and applying knowledge Thus, whilst the only solid foundation of professional attainments is laid, the mental faculties are expanded and strengthened for that growth in knowledge, usefulness and distinction to which every one who enlists in an honorable and responsible profession should aspire. The organization and arrangements by which these aims are successfully accomplished may be briefly stated as follows: ARRANGEMENT OF STUDIES. The length of the session (nine months) renders it practicable and convenient to distribute the subjects of instruction among a smaller number of Professors than in other medical schools of the United States, whose sessions are only four or five months long. This distribution brings the different subjects to the attention of the student in their natural and successive order. The arrangement of the lectures is such that he acquires a competent knowledge of Anatomy, Physiology and Chemistry before he enters upon the study of the principles and practice of Medicine and Surgery, which can only be studied properly in the light of the former. The instruction in Materia Medica and Pharmacy is also given in due relation to the progress of the student in chemistry. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. SCHOOL OF PHYSIOLOGY AND SURGERY. Prof. Cabell. Text-books:âYeo's Manual of Physiology; "Human Physiology," by Henry Power, (American edition); Wilson's Manual of Hygiene and Sanitary Science, fifth edition, 1884; Ashurst's Surgery; Klein's Histology. For occasional reference: Foster's Physiology; Green's Pathology; Ranney's Surgical Diagnosis. SCHOOL OF ANATOMY AND MATERIA MEDICA. Prof. Towles. Text-books:âWilson's or Gray's Anatomy; Farquharson's or Biddle's or Bartholow's Materia Medica. N. B.âThis School furnishes every facility for the study of Practical Anatomy that can be found in similar institutions elsewhere. Adequate provision is made for the supply of subjects, and each student has the opportunity, by actual dissection under the guidance of Doctor Towles, Demonstrator of Anatomy, of acquiring a practical knowledge of the structure of the human body in all its parts. SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, OBSTETRICS, AND MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. Prof. Harrison. Text-books:âTaylor's Medical Jurisprudence (last edition); Playfair's Midwifery (last edition); Roberts' Practice of Medicine (last edition); Hartshorne's Essentials. SCHOOL OF CHEMISTRY. Prof. Mallet. For the course in General Chemistry, see page 32. Throughout the course the attention of medical students is particularly drawn to the physiological, medical and sanitary relations of the subject. Text-book:âFownes's Chemistry. N. B.âIn addition to the above, two special courses of instruction will be given by the Professor of Analytical Chemistry, as follows: 1st, Twelve lessons in practical pharmaceutical manipulations, free of extra charge for tuition to members of the regular medical class who desire to take it, and engage to attend throughout the course. For the charge for material consumed, see page 53. 2nd, Sixteen lessons in the practical applications of Chemistry to MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. Medicine; as, the detection of poisons, chemical and microscopical examination of animal products, urine, blood, etc. For fees, see page 52. Neither of these special courses is required for the degree of Doctor of Medicine. A satisfactory examination upon the former course and payment of the tuition fee is required for the Proficiency in Pharmacy. APPARATUS AND ILLUSTRATION. The equipment of the Medical Department in apparatus, specimens and drawings is extensive and excellent. The collection of paintings for the illustration of the lectures on Anatomy, Physiology and Surgery, several hundred in number, is unusually good. LECTURES AND EXAMINATIONS. Favored as the student is in the comprehensiveness, scientific basis and order of his studies, he is not less favored by arrangements which give ample time for the preparation of every lecture, and address motives to him for such preparation. Each Professor gives three regular lectures a week, with occasional extra lectures, making the average weekly aggregate not over fourteen, or a little more than two a day. The student, therefore, is not over-burdened with lecture-room attendance. He has time for study in his private room, to consult books, and compare their teachings with the oral instructions of his Professor, and to digest and systematize his acquisitions from both sources. The daily examinations which precede every lecture supply the stimulus to regular and active study, serve as summary reviews of what he has already heard or read, and as correctives of any misconceptions he may have fallen into in his hearing or reading. The daily examinations constitute a very valuable part of the exercises of the Institution, and are taken into account in determining the fitness of a student for graduation. DEGREE. The degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred upon such students as prove their fitness for the same by rigid and searching examination. It has ever been the policy of the Institution to make its honors testimonials of merit, and not merely certificates of attendance on a prescribed course of instruction. (See p. 51.) EXPENSES. The expenses of a medical student are from $301 to $363 a session. LAW DEPARTMENT. JOHN B. MINOR, LL. D., Professor of Common and Statute Law. JAMES H. GILMORE, Professor of Constitutional and International Law, Equity, etc. This Department is organized with a view to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through textbooks and partly through lectures, with daily examination upon both. A Moot-court, in connection with other instruction, tends to perfect the student in the details of practice. Under the immediate supervision of the Professors, he is required to pronounce opinions upon supposed cases; to devise and institute remedies by suit or otherwise; to conduct suits at law and in equity from their inception, through all their stages; to draw wills, conveyances, and other assurances; and in short, to perform most of the functions of a practising lawyer. The Department comprises two Schools, each of which is divided into two classes, and the course of study is as follows: SCHOOL OF COMMON AND STATUTE LAW. Prof. Minor. Junior Class:âMinor's Institutes of Common and Statute Law, namely: Vol. I., The Rights which Relate to the Person. Vol. II., The Rights which Relate to Real Property. Minor's Synopsis of Criminal Law. Blackstone's Commentaries. Senior Class:âMinor's Institutes of Common and Statute Law, namely: Vol. IV., The Practice of the Law in Civil Cases, including Pleading. Vol. III., The Rights which Relate to Personal Property. Stephen on Pleading. For reference:âVirginia Code (1873); Revised Statutes of United States. LAW DEPARTMENT. SCHOOL Of CONSTITUTIONAL And INTERNATIONAL LAW, MERCANTILE LAW, EVIDENCE, And EQUITY. Prof. Gilmore. Junior Class:âVattel's International Law, with Lectures; Lectures on Government; Federalist. Senior Class:âSmith's Mercantile Law; Greenleaf's Evidence; Adams's Equity, with Lectures. For reference:âStephen's Digest of the Law of Evidence. In the Department of Law, the degree of Bachelor of Law is conferred upon those who, upon examination conducted in writing, manifest an intimate acquaintance with the subjects taught in all the classes; and to those who, upon like examination, exhibit a competent knowledge of International and Constitutional Law, including the Science of Government, a Certificate of Proficiency is awarded. In order to obtain the degree, the whole of the course must be completed here, no preliminary examination being had upon entering. The course is designed for two sessions, and in general it is not prudent to devote less to it; the future professional success of the student depending much upon his full mastery of it. It is a maxim sanctioned by long and wide experience, that "he who is not a good lawyer when he comes to the bar, will seldom be a good one afterwards." And in order to such thorough acquaintance with the elements of the law, thought is requisite as well as reading; and for the purpose of thought, there must be time to digest, as well as industry to acquire. One cannot expect to gorge himself with law, as a boa constrictor does with masses of food, and then digest it afterwards; the process of assimilation must go on, if it is to proceed healthfully and beneficially, at the same time with the reception of the knowledge. So the athlete judges, who wishes to train the physical man to the most vigorous development, and the intellectual athlete should imitate the example. But whilst the student is advised, as a general rule, not to attempt to complete the course in a single session, yet, if he chooses to essay it (as some do successfully), he is admitted to the graduating examinations, and if he attains the standard required, he is entitled to the degree. The expenses of a Law student are from $271 to $333 for the session; books will cost about $80 additional. ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT. W. M. THORNTON. Professor of Mathematics Applied to Engineering. CHARLES S. VENABLE, LL. D., Professor of Mathematics. FRANCIS H. SMITH, M. A., LL. D., Professor of Natural Philosophy. JOHN W. MALLET, Ph. D., M. D., LL. D., F. R. S., Professor of Chemistry. F. P. DUNNINGTON, B. S., Professor of Analytical Chemistry. WM. M. FONTAINE, M. A., Professor of Natural History and Geology. R. D. BOHANNAN, B. S., C. &amp; M. E., Instructor in Pure Mathematics and Physics. This Department is designed to furnish intending engineers thorough and practical instruction in the principles of Engineering and the sciences connected therewith. For this purpose, in addition to the Schools of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Natural History and Geology, and Analytical Chemistry, the School of Mathematics Applied to Engineering has been established. For the first five Schools the courses of instruction are given in detail in the Scientific Department. SCHOOL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS. Prof. Thornton. The courses of this School are arranged as follows: I. Civil Engineering. Junior Class:âProjective Geometry, Engineering Geodesy, Engineering Construction, Lines of Communication. Senior Class:âEngineering Mechanics, Stability of Structures, Hydraulic Engineering. II. Mining Engineering. Junior Class:âProjective Geometry, Engineering Geodesy, Engineering Construction, Exploitation of Mines. ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT. Senior Class:âEngineering Mechanics, Mechanics of Machines, Theory of Prime Movers. Instruction in the foregoing subjects is conveyed by a course of systematic lectures, combined with assiduous practice in the field and at the drawing-board, continued throughout the course. In the lecture course, after careful elucidation of fundamental principles, the rules of construction are deduced, and applied to the criticism of existing structures and the design of proposed works. In the field course the adjustments and use of the instruments are taught, and the student, after a thorough drill in the methods of measuring and estimating lengths, altitudes, and angles, is required to execute surveys of lands, buildings, and topography; to locate lines for railways, highways and canals; and to set out curves, earth-works and masonry. In the course of design the easy and accurate use of pen and brush is first acquired by exercises in projective and topographic drawing. The student is then required, from assigned data, to compute the dimensions of proposed structures, and on the basis of his computations to prepare bills of material, and general and detailed drawings of the works; to draw up specifications and furnish estimates of quantities. To facilitate the instruction in this department, the University has provided a commodious and well-lighted lecture room and drawing hall, an adequate supply of field instruments of the best construction, and models and drawings of a large variety of structures, illustrating the best practice of modern engineers, American and foreign. Students who desire to enter the Department of Engineering should possess an accurate knowledge of the elements of Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry. With such preparation the following order of studies, leading to the Degrees of C. E. and M. E. is recommended: Degree of C. E.âFirst Year:âJunior Applied Mathematics, Chemistry, Mathematics. Second Year:âSenior Applied Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Mineralogy and Geology. Degree of M. E.âFirst Year:âJunior Applied Mathematics, General Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics. Second Year:âSenior Applied Mathematics, Industrial Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, Mineralogy and Geology. The expenses of a student of Civil Engineering are from $290 to $330. Those of a student of Mining Engineering are from $355 to $395. AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. JOHN R. PAGE, M. D., Professor of Agriculture, Zoology and Botany. FRANCIS H. SMITH, M. A., LL. D., Professor of Natural Philosophy. JOHN W. MALLET, Ph. D., M. D., LL. D., F. R. S., Professor of Chemistry. F. P. DUNNINGTON, B. S., Professor of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry. WM. M. FONTAINE, M. A., Professor of Natural History and Geology. W. M. THORNTON, Professor of Mathematics Applied to Engineering. The late Samuel Miller, of Lynchburg, having by deed given in trust one hundred thousand dollars for the establishment of a Department of Scientific and Practical Agriculture in the University, this Department was organized in 1869. Subsequently the above-named Professors were nominated by the Trustees of the Miller Fund, and elected by the Visitors; certain lands belonging to the University were set aside, and brought into cultivation as an Experimental Farm; and all necessary implements, apparatus, models and specimens of various kinds have been collected as material aids to the course of instruction. The following order of studies is recommended:âFirst Year:âJunior Physics, General Chemistry, Zoology, Agricultural Botany and Agriculture, and Mineralogy and Geology. Second Year:âScientific and Practical Agriculture, Agricultural and Industrial Chemistry, First Class of Analytical Chemistry, and Agricultural Engineering. The degree of Bachelor of Scientific Agriculture is conferred in this Department, (see page 51.) Trustees of the Miller Fund. J. F. SLAUGHTER, President. W. W. MINOR, S. V. SOUTHALL, S. W. FICKLIN,* * Deceased. H. W. JONES, GEO. W. PALMER, B. JOHNSON BARBOUR. R. T. W. DUKE, Secretary. AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. MILLER SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE, ZOOLOGY, AND BOTANY. Prof. Page. In this School are three classes, as follows: I. Agriculture; divided into two courses, Scientific and Practical. 1. The Scientific course comprises a review of what is known of the chemical composition, the structure and the functions of the organs of plants; and of the atmosphere and soil, as related to vegetable production. 2. The Practical course comprises the study of the nature and formation of soils; their exposure and drainage; the best methods of tillage; and the use of manures and fertilizers, with experiments to show their effects. Special instruction is given in the mechanical operations of the farm, and in the practical management of teams. This class is continued throughout the session. II. Zoology.âThis class studies the leading principles of the science, with special reference to the anatomy, physiology and morphology of typical species throughout the animal kingdom. Special lectures are given during the course on insects injurious to vegetation, on fish and oyster culture, and on the breeding, rearing, and diseases of domestic animals. The fine collection of Zoological specimens in the Brooks Museum affords excellent facilities for study of the science. The class is continued until the examination, about the middle of March. III. Botany.âThis class commences about the middle of March, and continues until the end of the session. The time is mainly devoted to the study of flowering plants, their analysis and determination. Cryptogamic Botany, especially fungi and fungoid diseases of plants, receive as much attention as possible. Text-books:â"How Crops Grow," and "How Crops Feed," by Johnson; "Scientific Agriculture," by Pendleton: "Manual of Zoology," by Nicholson; "School and Field Book of Botany," by Gray; Sack's Text-book.

      <field name="fulltext">SESSION. The Session is of nine months duration, commencing on the 1st of October, and continuing without intermission until Public Day, the Wednesday before the 3rd of July.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EXAMINATIONS. Besides the daily examination upon the previous lecture, two General Examinations of each class are held during the session, which every member is required to stand. The Intermediate Examination occurs near the middle of the session, and is upon the subjects of instruction of the first part of the course. The Final Examination occurs near the end of the session, and is upon the subjects of instruction of the second part of the course only, or upon those of the entire course. These examinations are conducted in writing. The questions have numerical values affixed. If the answers at any general examination amount in value to three-fourths of the aggregate value of the questions, a Distinction is awarded to the student, and the fact published at the close of the session. Examination for a Proficiency or for Graduation usually coincides with a general examination. The general and graduating examinations are conducted in each School by the Professor, in the presence of two other Professors, forming with him the committee of examination for that School. They are sufficiently comprehensive and difficult to render it impossible for a student, without steady diligence, to attain a Distinction, and candidates for a Proficiency or for Graduation are subjected to searching interrogations on the details as well as on the general principles of the subject, and are expected to be accurately versed in all matters treated in the lectures and correlative text. Moreover, the student's command of English, and his standing at both daily and general examinations are taken into account in estimating his qualification for the certificate or diploma.

One-third of the board is payable at the beginning of the session, and the remainder in two equal instalments, at three and six months thereafter. Washing is paid for monthly. Note.âFor summary of expenses see page 63.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EQUIPMENTS. The Library of the University, originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, and since much enlarged by purchases and donations, now contains about 42,000 volumes. (See page 62.) LEWIS BROOKS MUSEUM. The Lewis Brooks Museum contains collections illustrating the subjects of Geology, Mineralogy, Zoology and Botany. Each of the collections is selected so as to exemplify the principles of these sciences, and, at the same time, to exhibit a large variety of subjects for their study. Its primary object is to serve as an aid in teaching Natural History. In Geology the collections are large and well selected. The specimens of rocks show all the different kinds classified according to mineral character, and the formations in which they occur. The collection of fossils, plaster casts, maps, etc., is exceptionally fine, and fully illustrates Historical Geology. In Mineralogy the principles of the science are made plain by well-chosen suits of specimens, models of crystals, etc. The general collection of minerals contains all the important minerals, and many of the rarer ones, in good specimens. The science of Zoology is well illustrated by a fine and large collection of objects, such as mounted skeletons, stuffed animals, dried specimens, plaster casts, etc. In Botany the collections contain charts, papier-machÃ© models of flowers, fruits, sections of wood, etc. The bulk of the collection is in the form of an herbarium selected from the most important and interesting botanical regions of the world. In addition to the above, a beginning has been made of a collection to illustrate the geology and mineralogy of the State of Virginia, and this will be increased as rapidly as possible. LEANDER McCORMICK OBSERVATORY. The Astronomical Observatory on the University grounds is the gift of Leander J. McCormick, Esq., of Chicago. It contains the great refracting telescope of 26 inches aperture, constructed for Mr. McCormick EQUIPMENTS. by Alvan Clark &amp; Sons, and given by him to the University. The directorship has been endowed with the sum of $50,000 by the Alumni and other friends of the University; and an additional sum of $25,000, given to the Institution by the late Wm. H. Vanderbilt, Esq., of New York, has been invested, that the income may form a working fund for Observatory. (See page 35.) CHEMICAL LABORATORY. A building planned and erected for the purpose is exclusively used as a chemical lecture-room and laboratory. It is completely fitted with the most approved appliances, and stocked with apparatus, models, materials and specimens. The commodious lecture-room, with work and store rooms attached, is provided with every convenience for exhibiting a complete series of experiments illustrating the lectures on General Chemistry. The large room assigned to Analytical Chemistry will accommodate fifty working students, and is furnished with work tables, gas, water, and all proper laboratory fixtures; and all requisite apparatus, chemicals, minerals, materials for analysis, etc., are kept constantly supplied by home purchase and importation. A very large number of specimens, constituting a Museum of Industrial Chemistry, has been collected, at much expense and pains, in this country, England, France and Germany, illustrating the products and processes of Chemistry applied to the Arts and Manufactures, and so arranged as to be a most valuable aid to the student of Industrial Chemistry. (See page 32.) PHYSICAL LABORATORY. A suitable room has been assigned to this object by the Board of Visitors. The needful fittings have been partly provided, and its thorough equipment will be pushed forward as rapidly as funds for the purpose can be obtained. (See p. 31.) UNIVERSITY CHAPEL. A sum sufficient to build a handsome chapel within the University precincts is being subscribed by the present members, alumni, and friends of the University. The walls and roof have been erected during the last year, and the building will be pushed on to completion as speedily as the progress of the subscription will allow.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">SCHOLARSHIPS. UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS. Seven scholarships, entitling the successful candidates at a competitive examination to prosecute the studies of one session at the University of Virginia without the payment of matriculation or tuition fees, are open to new-comers from all the States at the beginning of the academic year (October 1st). Of these seven scholarships, five are in the Academic Department, and two in the Department of Engineering. The examination is uniform, and embraces Latin, Greek, Mathematics, and English. In order to secure positive attainments, the right is reserved to reject any papers that do not reach the standard required for a Distinction at the Final Examination in Junior Latin, Junior Greek, and Junior Mathematics, and do not show a competent acquaintance with the grammatical and rhetorical structure of the English language. The subjects of examination in Latin, Greek and Mathematics for these scholarships will be found under the head "Junior Class" of those Schools. For more precise information apply to the Professors. FREE SCHOLARSHIPS. The Visitors, in September, 1882, founded two free scholarships, to be called the Corcoran Scholarship and the McCormick Scholarship. For information respecting these apply to the Chairman of the Faculty. MILLER SCHOLARSHIPS. There are four scholarships in the Agricultural Department, named for its founder. These scholarships are bestowed on competitive examination, and the emolument is $250 to each of the two candidates attaining the first and second places in the competition, with free tuition in the Schools of the Department to the other two candidates attaining the absolute standard required.

      <field name="fulltext">SOCIETIES OF STUDENTS. LITERARY SOCIETIES. There are two Literary Societies of long standing, the Washington Society and the Jefferson Society, connected with the University. They meet weekly in their respective halls for the purpose of cultivating debate and composition, and hold public exhibitions at intervals during the session, and at its close. Each Society bestows medals on its best debaters, and the two Societies in conjunction give a medal to the best writer in the University Magazine, which is maintained by them. The Annual Address before these Societies will be delivered the present year on June 29th, in the Public Hall. YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. This society seeks to guard new students from evil influences, and furnishes opportunities for Christian work in the University and its neighborhood. It has been in active operation many years. It has established and maintains the STUDENTS' READING ROOM. This is convenient of access, comfortably arranged and furnished, and supplied with a large selection of the best periodical literature. It is open to all members of the University upon the payment of an annual fee of $4.00 to meet its current expenses. TEMPERANCE UNION. The Temperance Union of the University is an association which does good service in guarding students against vice, and promotes literary culture by valuable prizes to its best debaters and orators. SQUIBB GYMNASIUM ASSOCIATION. Founded upon a liberal gift from E. H. Squibb, M. D., of Brooklyn, N. Y., for the promotion of physical culture. It is provided with a convenient hall, and with apparatus.</field>

It is also empowered "to employ agents to obtain endowments for scholarships and professorships, to solicit donations, to dispose of anything of value belonging to the Society, or entrusted to its management for the purpose of endowing professorships or scholarships, or for accomplishing any of the other objects of the Society authorized by its charter." ADDRESS. The Annual Address before the Society of Alumni will be delivered the present year on June 30th, in the Public Hall, by Judge C. E. Fenner, of New Orleans, La.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REGULATIONS. ADMISSION. To be admitted as a student of the University, the applicant must be at least sixteen years of age; but the Faculty may dispense with this requirement in favor of one who has a brother of the requisite age entering at the same time. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he must produce a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence of general good conduct. NUMBER OF SCHOOLS. An academical student must attend at least three Schools, unless upon the written request of his parent or guardian, or for good cause shown, the Faculty shall allow him to attend a less number. EXCHANGE OF SCHOOLS. Students are permitted to exchange Schools, with transfer of fees, within one week after admission. Thereafter no exchange is allowed except by leave of the Faculty, and then without transfer of fees. ENTRANCE AND WITHDRAWAL. No abatement is made in the matriculation or tuition fees or room rent, on account of late entrance, unless the student enter after the first of January, and no portion of the same is refunded on account of withdrawal from the University before the close of the session, unless the withdrawal be rendered necessary by ill health. The charges for board, fuel, lights, and washing, are estimated from the time of entrance. Many disadvantages to the student result from late entrance; therefore prompt attendance at the beginning of the session is earnestly enjoined upon all who wish to derive full benefit from the course of instruction. DORMITORIES. The following are enactments of the Visitors: 1. A student who proposes to lodge in a University dormitory shall pay in advance the full rent of the same, with the privilege of sharing the room and its rent with a fellow student: provided, in case of joint occupancy and of changes, the charge be equitably divided by the Proctor among the joint or successive occupants, so as to obtain not less than the full rent of the dormitory. 2. Every student lodging elsewhere shall deposit in advance $15 as an indemnity for rent; and at the close of the session the amount due for unoccupied dormitories shall be estimated and divided equally among the students lodging elsewhere as a charge to each, the remainder, if any, being credited in final settlement: provided, said charge for indemnity shall in no case exceed $15. REGULATIONS. 3. Of the dormitories, 131 shall rent for $30 each. Of the remainder, 40 shall rent for $15 each, for the benefit of the members of the Boarding Clubs; but each of said 40 dormitories shall be occupied by two students, they dividing its rent. 4. To secure dormitory rooms in the University Buildings, application may be made by letter to the Proctor; but if the rent be not deposited with him before the 15th of September, the room is considered unengaged. PRIVILEGED STUDENTS. Ministers of the Gospel may attend any of the Schools of the University without the payment of tuition fees. The same privilege will be extended to any young man preparing for the ministry, on condition that he submit testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. MONTHLY CIRCULAR. At the end of every month a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from lectures and examinations, and any other irregularities of which he may have been guilty, together with such further information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate, or as the parent or guardian may specially request. The object of such reports being, on the one hand, to incite the student to steady diligence, by eliciting the commendation and encouragement of his friends, and, on the other, to restrain him from idleness and disorder, or to urge him to amendment by their admonition and advice, their usefulness greatly depends upon the prompt and judicious attention they receive from those to whom they are addressed. Parents and guardians, therefore, cannot be too earnest in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly reports may suggest. LICENTIATES. Any person of unexceptionable character and habits, upon producing to the Faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity and attainments, will be licensed by the Faculty to form classes for private instruction in any School of the University, in aid of and in conformity to the public teachings of the Professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment, selection, and compensation of such Licentiate is left to the determination of the students. PROHIBITION OF CREDIT. An act of the legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students. The license to contract debts, which the Chairman is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing), to cases of urgent necessity; and these, it is hoped, parents and guardians will prevent, as far as possible, by a timely supply of the requisite funds. DISCIPLINE AND RELIGIOUS WORSHIP. Morality and Religion are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomtants of education. The discipline of the University is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity, and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are REGULATIONS. made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience having proved that the best way to effect this result is to forbear the employment of coercion, the attendance on religious exercises is entirely voluntary. Prayers are held every morning in the chapel, and divine service is conducted twice on Sunday by a Chaplain, selected in turn from the principal religious denominations. USE OF LIBRARY. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the librarian is present in the library for six hours daily, to attend to their wants. Persons at a distance, who may desire to consult the library by correspondence, can do so on payment of a small charge, proportioned to the time and labor expended on the research required, the copying of titles, or passages from authors, etc. A letter on this subject, addressed to Wm. A. Winston, Librarian, will receive attention. INFIRMARY. There is a well-appointed Infirmary connected with the University for the care and comfort of sick students. Every student on matriculation deposits the infirmary fee ($7.00), which entitles him, in case of sickness during the session, to the advice and attendance of the infirmary physicians (the Professors in the Medical Department), and, if necessary, to nursing by professional nurses, without additional charge. VIRGINIA ACADEMICAL STUDENTS. By act of the General Assembly of Virginia, approved March 15th, 1884, the University "shall give instruction to all white students of the state of Virginia, over the age of sixteen years, who shall be matriculated under the rules and regulations prescribed by the Board of Visitors, without charge for tuition in the academic department, consisting of the following schools, to-wit: the schools of Latin, Greek, modern languages, pure mathematics, moral philosophy, natural philosophy, historical science, agriculture, zoology and botany, natural history and geology, general and industrial chemistry, and English language and literature: provided, that no person shall be admitted as a student, free of charge for tuition fees, under the provisions of this act, unless the Faculty shall be satisfied by actual examination of the applicant, or by a certificate from some college or preparatory school, that he has made such proficiency in the branch of study which he proposes to pursue as will enable him to avail himself of the advantages afforded by the University." ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS. A Virginian wishing to secure the advantages offered by the foregoing enactment must pass a satisfactory examination, held by the Committee of Examination of the school named therein which he proposes to enter, such examination being subject to revision by the Faculty. The entrance examinations occur at the opening of the session. No student is subjected to entrance examinations, excepting Virginians seeking free tuition. For admission to the Schools of English, Modern Languages, Chemistry, Natural History and Geology, and Agriculture, Zoology and Botany, the requirements are a knowledge of English and Arithmetic. For the other academical schools, students are referred to the Professors in charge, or to the Chairman of the Faculty. REGULATIONS. DONATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. Under an act of the Legislature, entitled "A bill to encourage donations to the University of Virginia, and to constitute the State of Virginia the trustee thereof," "any person may deposit in the treasury of this State, or bequeath money, stock, or public bonds of any kind, to be so deposited, or grant, devise, or bequeath property, real or personal, to be sold, and the proceeds to be so deposited, in sums not less than one hundred dollars, which shall be invested in certificates of debt of the State of Virginia, or of the United States, or any other State thereof, for the benefit of the University of Virginia; and in such case the interest or dividend accruing on such stock, certificates of debt, or bonds, shall be paid to the Rector and Visitors of the University, to be by them appropriated to the general purposes thereof, unless some particular appropriation shall have been designated by the donor or testator, as hereinafter provided. . . . . The State of Virginia is hereby constituted the trustee for the safe-keeping and due application of all funds which may be deposited in the treasury in pursuance of this act." LEGAL TITLE OF THE UNIVERSITY. `The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia." SUMMARY OF EXPENSES OF STUDENTS.
