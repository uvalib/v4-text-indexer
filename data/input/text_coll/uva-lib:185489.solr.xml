      <field name="fulltext">Supp. # 15, 9-70 Preface This volume, as originally published, constituted a revision and recodification of the general ordinances of the City of Charlottesville, Virginia, the last preceding codification having been published in 1959. The new Code contained the Charter and such of the ordinances of a general and permanent nature passed on or before June 21, 1965, as were found desirable for retention, except those expressly saved from repeal by the Adopting Ordinance. This Code, as now supplemented, contains ordinances passed through the date shown on the instruction sheet for the supplemental pages. The ordinances were codified, edited and indexed by the Editorial Staff of Michie City Publications Company under the supervision of Chas. W. Sublett, Stephen C. Willard and Robert F. Hoover. The publishers wish to express their appreciation for the cooperation of all the city officials and employees during the preparation of this publication. Particular acknowledgment is due Mr. James E. Bowen, Jr., City Manager, Mr. Harry T. Marshall, City Attorney, and Mr. Sidney Rush, Jr., Clerk of Council, for their assistance during the progress of the work. A feature to which the attention of the user is directed is the arrangement of the chapters in alphabetical order. Attention is also directed to the analysis preceding each chapter which, in many instances, will serve as an index within itself. The general index, carried at the end of the Code, has been carefully prepared and should serve as an accurate medium for locating the individual sections of law within the Code. In the footnotes appearing throughout the Code will be found references to the Charter and the applicable state law. These notes also contain cross references to other and related provisions in the City Code. By reference to the historical citations, appearing at the end of the individual sections, the user will be able to ascertain the ordinance or section of the 1959 City Code from which the present section has been derived. The absence of a citation indicates new material becoming effective on the effective date of this Code. It is a recognized fact that if any Code is to accomplish its intended purpose it must be kept up to date by means of an Supp. # 15, 9-70 adequate supplemental service. Accordingly, the publishers point out the advisability and necessity of keeping this Code current. The new City Code is presented to the officials and citizens of the City of Charlottesville in the belief that it will merit their approval.

Any producer or distributor of milk or milk products the grade of which has been lowered by the health officer, and who is properly labeling his milk and milk products, or whose permit has been suspended at any time may make application for the regrading of his products or the reinstatement of his permit. Upon receipt of a satisfactory application for regrading or reinstatement of permit based on correction of a violation of any bacteriological or cooling-temperature standard, the health officer shall take further samples at the rate of not more than two per week and shall approve the application upon compliance with the grade requirements as determined in accordance with section 17-6; provided, that if samples are not available because of suspension of permit to operate, or for other reasons, the health officer may issue a temporary permit upon satisfying himself, by inspection of the facilities and operating methods, that the conditions responsible for the violation have been corrected, with final reinstatement of permit conditional upon subsequent bacteriological or temperature findings. In case the lowered grade of the applicant's product or the permit suspension has been due to a violation of an item other than bacteriological standards or cooling temperature, the application shall be accompanied by a statement, signed by the applicant, to the effect that the violated item of the specifications has been corrected. Within one week of the receipt of such an application and statement, the health officer shall make a reinspection of the applicant's establishment and thereafter as many additional reinspections as he may deem necessary to assure himself that the applicant is again complying with the higher grade requirements, and, in case the findings justify, shall regrade the milk or milk products upward or reinstate the permit.

Regulations generally; amendment of zoning map; purposes. The regulations set forth in this article, or set forth elsewhere in this Appendix and referred to in the article, are the Flood Plain (FP) district regulations. The FP district boundaries are hereby established along the boundaries of the intermediate regional flood delineated in studies prepared by the United States Army Corps of Engineers for the Rivanna River (June 1971), Moores Creek (September 1971) and Meadow Creek (January 1972), which are incorporated by reference in this article. The zoning map adopted Supp. # 27, 3-74 and incorporated by section 4 of this Appendix is hereby amended to show the boundaries of the FP districts delineated in such studies. The FP districts are intended to overlap the existing zones of the territory included within the area of the intermediate regional flood, and the regulations Supp. # 25, 6-73 imposed by this article are intended as supplemental to and not in lieu of the existing zoning regulations within such boundaries. This district is established for the purpose of: 1. Controlling flood plain uses, such as fill, dumping, storage of materials, structures, buildings, and any other works which acting alone or in combination with other existing or future uses will cause damaging flood heights and velocities by obstructing flows and reducing valley storage; 2. Protecting human life and health; 3. Minimizing public and private property damage; 4. Providing for public awareness of the potential for flooding; 5. Controlling development which will, when acting alone or in combination with similar developments, create an unjustified demand for public investment in flood-control works, by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including public facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 6. Controlling development which will, when acting alone or in combination with similar development, cause flood losses if public streets, sewer, water, and other utilities must be extended below the flood level to serve the development; 7. Controlling development which will, when acting alone or in combination with similar development, create an additional burden to the public to pay the costs of rescue, relief, emergency preparedness measures, sandbagging, pumping, and temporary dikes or levees. (6-4-73, § 1.) Sec. 43B. Definitions. When used in this article the following words and phrases shall have the meanings herein ascribed to them unless another meaning is plainly apparent from the context: 1. "Flood plain" means the extent of the intermediate regional flood (100 year flood) as defined by the studies of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers and adopted as district boundaries by section 43A. 2. "Flood way" means the extent of the channel of a Supp. # 25, 6-73 watercourse and adjacent land areas which are required to carry and discharge the flood water of an intermediate regional flood (100 year flood) without increasing flood stages more than one foot above the levels which would occur naturally. (6-4-73, § 1.) Sec. 43C. Use regulations. The use regulations in force in the existing zoning districts overlapped by the FP district shall be continued in force; however, the FP district shall be subject to the additional use regulations set forth in this article. 1. The following uses having low flood-damage potential and a low potential for obstructing flood flows shall be permitted without site plan approval within the FP district to the extent that they are not prohibited by any other ordinance and provided they do not require permanent structures, fill, or storage of materials or equipment: a. Agricultural and conservation uses such as gardening, horticulture, cultivation and harvesting of crops according to recognized soil conservation practices, outdoor plant nurseries, pasture, grazing, wildlife and nature preserves, arboretums, and forestry; b. Open private and public recreational uses which do not require permanent or temporary structures such as parks, playfields, picnic grounds, hunting and fishing areas, golf courses and driving ranges, hiking and horseback riding trails, nature paths, and bicycle trails; c. Circuses, carnivals and other similar transient amusement enterprises, as provided for under existing city ordinances; d. Public service uses, such as outlet installations for sewage treatment plants, sealed wells for public water supply, storm drainage facilities, water and sewer monitoring devices, and flood warning aids and devices. 2. Existing uses. Any trailer placed, or any future trailer placed on an existing trailer site, or any residential, commercial or industrial building erected or begun prior to the date of enactment of this article, may remain and shall not be considered to be a nonconforming use by virtue of this article. Supp. # 25, 6-73 Further, without applying for site plan approval, the owner of an existing trailer, or of a future trailer on an existing trailer site, or of any other existing residential structure or auxiliary building in conjunction with an existing residential use, may make repairs, additions, improvements or reconstruction to such trailer or residential structure, provided that such repairs, additions, improvements or reconstruction do not add more than 50% to the ground floor area of the trailer or other residential structure. Such repairs, additions, improvements, or reconstruction shall likewise not be considered to be nonconforming by virtue of this article. (6-4-73, § 1.) Sec. 43D. Uses permitted subject to site plan review. Any use permitted in an existing district which is overlapped by the FP district is permitted in the corresponding portion of the FP district, provided that the following conditions are met: 1. A plan for the development of the entire site which lies within the flood plain shall be submitted in accordance with the provisions of section 72A. On application of any owner of property within the FP district the city shall determine and establish in the field on such property the elevation of the boundaries of the flood plain and flood way, as related to mean sea level. Such determination shall be made with reference to data prepared by the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers or other qualified engineering sources, based upon generally accepted hydraulic engineering practices. Such owner shall then be entitled to utilize the boundaries so determined in preparation of his site plan. 2. Prerequisites for flood plain development: a. The lowest habitable floor of any residential structure must be at least one foot higher than the elevation of the outer limit of the FP district. The elevation of said lowest floor shall be provided along with the required site plan. Any basement or cellar of a residential structure not designed for human habitation may lie below the elevation of the outer limit of the FP district, provided that it is flood proofed in accordance with section 43D-2c. of this article and further provided that the location of such structure does not encroach upon the flood way. b. Any new structure, other than a residential structure, to Supp. # 25, 6-73 be built in a business or manufacturing zone overlapped by the FP district, or any addition to an existing commercial or industrial building, shall be constructed so that the lowest floor is at least one foot higher than the elevation of the outer limit of the FP district, or shall be flood proofed in accordance with section 43D-2c. of this article, provided that in no case shall such structure encroach upon the flood way. c. In cases in which flood proofing measures are permitted to satisfy the requirements of this article the planning commission shall seek to insure in the process of site plan review that such measures will be consistent with flood elevations, velocities and volumes of the intermediate regional flood for the site in question. On any building or structure for which flood proofing is required, such measures shall be performed to an elevation of one foot above the level of the intermediate regional flood. The following flood proofing measures may be required: 1. Anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement; 2. Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads, and shutters, or similar methods of construction; 3. Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressure; 4. Use of paints, membranes, or mortars to reduce seepage of water through walls; 5. Addition of mass or weight to structures to resist flotation; 6. Installation of pumps to lower water levels in structures; 7. Construction of water supply and waste-treatment systems so as to prevent the entrance of flood waters; 8. Installation of pumping facilities or comparable practices for subsurface drainage systems for buildings, to relieve external foundation wall and basement flood pressures; 9. Construction to resist rupture or collapse caused by water pressure or floating debris; 10. Installation of valves or controls on sanitary and storm drains which will permit the drains to be closed to prevent back-up of sewage and storm waters into the buildings or structures. Gravity draining of basements may be eliminated by mechanical devices; Supp. # 25, 6-73 11. Location of all electrical equipment, circuits, and installed electrical appliances in a manner which will assure they are not subject to flooding and which provides protection from inundation by the intermediate regional flood; 12. Location of any structural storage facilities for chemicals, explosives, buoyant materials, flammable liquids, or other toxic materials which could be injurious to plant, animal or human life at elevations at least one foot above the elevation of the outer limit of the FP district; d. Fill is permitted within the FP district if the following conditions are satisfied: 1. Any fill proposed to be deposited in the flood plain must be shown to have some beneficial purpose and the amount thereof to be not greater than is necessary to achieve the purpose, as demonstrated by a plan submitted by the owner showing the uses to which the filled land will be put and the final dimensions of the proposed fill; 2. Such fill shall be protected against erosion by compaction, riprap, vegetative cover, or bulkheading; 3. The fill shall be of such material as will not pollute surface water or ground water; 4. Such fill shall not extend into or encroach upon the flood way. e. Storage of material or equipment that is not flammable, explosive, or potentially injurious to human, animal or plant life may be permitted in an overlapped zone which permits such use, if such material or equipment is readily removable within the time available after flood warning or if adequate flood proofing is provided, in accordance with section 43D-2(c) of this article. f. Parking lots which are otherwise permissible under existing city ordinances are permitted within the FP district if marked by a sign indicating the area that is subject to flooding and warning parkers of the potential danger. g. Campgrounds shall be subject to the approval of the planning commission through the procedures of site plan review provided in section 72A. h. Marinas, boat rental facilities and other similar uses shall Supp. # 25, 6-73 be subject to the approval of the planning commission through the procedures of site plan review provided in section 72A. i. Sand and gravel extraction operations shall be subject to the approval of the planning commission through the procedures of site plan review provided in section 72A. j. The straightening of any stream, or the altering of its course in any way, shall be subject to the approval of the planning commission through the procedures of site plan review provided in section 72A. (6-4-73, § 1.) Sec. 43E. Discontinuance of uses. If the use of any structure which existed prior to the date of enactment of this article is discontinued for two consecutive years, any future use of the structure shall be considered a new use and shall comply with the requirements set forth in this article. (6-4-73, § 1.) Sec. 43F. Documents to be available for public inspection. Copies of all U. S. Army Corps of Engineers' studies and other available documents pertaining to the flood plains of the Rivanna River, Moores Creek and Meadow Creek which are relevant to the determinations and requirements set forth in this article shall be kept on file for public inspection in the office of the city planning department. (6-4-73, § 1.) Sec. 43G. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The granting of approval of any structure or use shall not constitute a representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind or nature by the city or the planning commission or by any officer or employee thereof, of the practicality or safety of any structure or use proposed and shall create no liability upon or cause action against such public body, officer, or employee for any damage that may result pursuant thereto. The degree of flood protection required by this article within the FP district is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. The Supp. #25, 6-73 district and article do not imply that areas outside the flood plain district or land uses permitted within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damage. Nothing contained herein shall create any liability on the part of the city or any officer, agency or employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. (6-4-73, § 1.) Sec. 43H. Appeals. An applicant for site plan approval as required in this chapter may appeal the planning commission's decision on the site plan to the city council. (6-4-73, § 1.)

When an appeal is filed with the secretary of the board of zoning appeals, the petitioner shall on that same day post Supp. 3-67 a sign on each lot included in the petition stating that an appeal has been filed with the board of zoning appeals for a variance and/or exception to the Zoning Ordinance. Such signs shall be furnished by the building official and shall be located so as to be visible from the street. It shall be the duty of the petitioner or petitioners to maintain, or to replace the signs if they are destroyed, until such time as the board of zoning appeals has disposed of the petition. The board of zoning appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal, give public notice thereof as required by section 15.1-431 of the Code of Virginia, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within sixty days. At the public hearing held by the board of zoning appeals on the petition, the petitioner shall affirm that such posting has been done; provided however, that if such signs are obliterated or destroyed during the period required to be posted such fact shall not be essential to jurisdiction of the petition by the board of zoning appeals, if the petitioner satisfies the board of zoning appeals that such signs were originally properly posted and that such obliteration or destruction occurred without petitioner's knowledge. (2-17-58, § 33-66; 6-7-65, § 5; 2-6-67.) Sec. 67. Powers of board generally; variances and exceptions. The board of zoning appeals, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, shall have the following powers: 1. To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is any error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the building official in the enforcement of this ordinance5 5. This Appendix. or of any other ordinance adopted pursuant hereto. 2. To authorize, upon appeal in specific cases, such variance from the terms of this ordinance6 6. This Appendix. as will not be contrary to the public interest, when, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship; provided, that the spirit of this ordinance Supp. 3-67 shall be observed and substantial justice done, as follows: When a property owner can show that his property was acquired in good faith and where by reason of the exceptional narrowness, shallowness, size or shape of a specific piece of property as of February 17, 1958, or where by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other extraordinary situation or condition of such piece of property, or of the use or development of property immediately adjacent thereto, the strict application of the terms of this ordinance would effectively prohibit or unreasonably restrict the use of the property, or where the board is satisfied, upon the evidence heard by it, that the granting of such variance will alleviate a fairly demonstrable hardship approaching confiscation, as distinguished from a special privilege or convenience sought by the applicant; provided, that all variances shall be in harmony with the intended spirit and purpose of this ordinance. No such variance shall be authorized by the board unless it finds: (a) That the strict application of this ordinance would produce undue hardship. (b) That such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the same zoning district in the same vicinity. (c) That the authorization of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property and that the character of the district will not be changed by the granting of the variance. (d) That the authorizing of the variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property or unreasonably increase the congestion of public streets, or increase the danger of fire or imperil the public safety or unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the surrounding areas, or in any other respect impair the health, safety, comfort, moral or general welfare of the inhabitants of the City of Charlottesville. (e) That the conditions constituting a hardship have not been created by the applicant's own acts. No such variance shall be authorized except after notice and hearing, as required by section 15.1-431 of the Code of Virginia. No variance shall be authorized unless the board finds that the condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the property is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an amendment to this ordinance. In authorizing a variance, the board may impose such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed structure or use it may deem necessary in the public interest, and may require a guarantee or bond to insure that the conditions imposed are being and will continue to be complied with. 3. To hear and determine applications for special exceptions to the terms of this ordinance. Applications for special exceptions may be made by any property owner, tenant, government official, department, board or bureau. Such applications shall be made to the building official in accordance with the rules adopted by the board. The application and accompanying maps, plans or other information shall be transmitted promptly to the secretary of the board, who shall place the matter on the docket, advertise a public hearing thereon, which shall be held not less than ten days after such advertising, and give written notice of such hearing to the parties in interest. The building official shall also transmit a copy of the application to the planning commission, which may send a recommendation to the board or appear as a party at the hearing. Such special exceptions shall include and be limited to the following: (a) Permit the extension of a district where the boundary line of a district divides a lot or tract held in single ownership as of February 17, 1958. (b) Interpret the provisions of this ordinance where the street layout actually on the ground, varies from the street layout as shown on the district map made a part of this ordinance. (c) Permit the erection and use of a building or the use of premises in any location for a public service corporation for public utility purposes which the board deems reasonably necessary for the public convenience and welfare. (d) Permit the occupancy of a single detached residence in an R-1 or R-2 residential district by more than two housekeeping units, provided: (1) That such residence shall have been in existence on January 21, 1932. (2) That such multiple occupancy shall not be deemed to alter the character of the neighborhood in which such residence is located.

When a petition for a change in a district classification is filed with the clerk of the council, the petitioner shall on that same date post a sign or signs as follows: For one lot—one sign visible from the abutting street. For two through ten contiguous lots—one sign at each end of the lots sought to be changed, and there shall be at least one sign visible from each abutting street.
