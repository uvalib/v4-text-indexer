      <field name="fulltext">Miss Mary J. HarrisonHarrisonburg Virginia June 10th 1852 My dear Sister: I promised to write to you from our dear Brothers, hoping that by my stay here my spirits would be better than when at home &amp; I could write a more interesting letter. But oh how uncertain are all we promise ourselves on Earth. The Lord in his wisdom has seen fit to take poor, dear little Frank to himself &amp; many hearts are sad like my own. Oh he looks so sweet, so much like a little angel. Oh I think so much of the joy in Heaven. Our dear Father has I trust met with his son, &amp; his little grandson, &amp; they with those who went before them are now praising that Saviour who bought them with his precious blood. May all of us prove faithful &amp; finally meet them is my prayer. My poor dear Mother I greatly fear is not able to stand so much long. Grace I trust will be granted her to bear up under her heavy afflictions, &amp; she may be enabled to say with Job of old the Lord gave &amp; the Lord hath taken away blessed be his Holy name. Brother &amp; Sister are in deep distress, &amp; their children all feel deeply little Frank's death. Poor Mary particularly. I have not heard from Mr. Stevens today. I hope he is better. I reckon some one writes from there to Sister Hag. daily. Little Minnie is well. Little Lucy Pa tells me has been quite sick but is getting better. She is with Ha. I cant write any more now. I hope to hear from you or some member of the family soon. Oh my dear Sister pray for me &amp; my little fathorless children. Tell Bro. Wheelwright that I want to write to him, &amp; will as soon as I can feel enough composed to do so. My love to my dear Mother, Carrie, Fannie, Sister Mag., Mrs. Stevens, Lucy, Mrs. Kyle, Cousin Julia, &amp; all enquiring friends. Your sister affectionately M. F. Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Washington June 11 1852 Dear Bro S. I have attended toyyour request in regard to the note you sent me for collection, and find the officers not willing to do any thing without their regular commission. They will make no bargin, and I have enquired about the man myself but can hear nothing of him. I will endeavor to find him, and if you think proper to pay the fee to have it collected by a constable, let me know. We have quite a change in the weather, and these changes generally give me colds. I took Eliza and E. R. to Balt. on Saturday and I returned on Tuesday leaving them to spend a week or so. Eliza and myself were walking along the street we met with James. I approached him and offered my hand. He shook with me and Eliza. We invited him to see us at Dr. Davis', but he said he could not accept the invitations. So we left him, and I hope he will be happy. I have nothing to write. How is yr. Mother? Our love to all. Farewell. M. G. Hamilton Please send my account when you write again, and I should like to see Clines account. Tell him to send it to me. And Mr. Orr has not said how much he intends to increase his rent on account of his extra improvements. I suppose Chas. Ball has got home. I saw him here a few days ago. I am extremely sorry to hear that Dr. Eskridge has lost his office, and that too by one of the meanest man earth. What will the poor fellow do? Oh! we live in an uncirtain world, where it requires the grace of trus religion to sustain us under our misfortunes and trials. And thank God the Gospel brings us timely and adapted relief, and promises timely release from all that oppresses our hearts or darkens our prospects. May kind heaven constantly supply us with this grace, that we may walk by faith and not by sight. Pray for us. We want to live to the Glory of Him whose we are, and who bought us by His death. Old Dan.l McKallister from Kentucky has been to see me. He will be in Leesburg before he goes home.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Mary J. HarrisonHarrisonburg Virginia My dear Sister:- I have been wanting to write to you ever since I received your kind and comforting letter; but my feelings have been such that I could not. Oh my dear Sister you know not the desolation of my poor heart!!! All of my prospects of earthly happiness are forever blasted!!! My dear, dear Husband is gone &amp; I am left with two fatherless little children to make my way through life as I can. Mysterious are the ways of Providence, but all is done in wisdom, &amp; will work for our good if we will but put our trust in our Heavenly Father. This I am trying to do, &amp; I hope grace sufficient will be given me to bear up under my great-very great affliction. Oh that I had been better prepared to part with my loved one. As you said he bore his sufferings with so much patience that we were not aware of his condition, &amp; until the day before he died too we felt sure he was improving. Were it not for the blessed hope I have of meeting him in a better world, where sickness &amp; parting never come, I would be in the very depths of dispair. I do bless the Lord, that even in his dying hour, he looked to the Sinners friend, &amp; was enabled to breathe his last without a struggle or a groan, &amp; left an assurance that he had a hope of Heaven. Brother told you I know of his peaceful death. What a great cause of thankfulness. We sorrow not as those without hope. Indeed some say that we ought rather to rejoice than weep. Oh that I could see you &amp; all at home. My poor Mother how much I feel for her. Oh my dear Sister if it were not for the salvation of his soul why was he taken from his dependent family—widowed Mother &amp; unprotected Sisters? Oh yes he must have been taken from "the evil to come." I expect to go the the University tomorrow &amp; will write to you from there. The poor little children are better than they have been. Lucy has been suffering a good deal with her bowels, but for the last few days has suffered less. Minnie had one of old attacks last Sunday-fever &amp; one spasm-but today is as well as usual. Poor little dear she says her Pa is dead. I have received Bro. Wheelwright's letter &amp; will answer it soon. Oh tis so comforting. Give a great deal of love to my dear Mother for me &amp; tell her I am coming to see her as soon as I can, &amp; also to Fannie, Carrie, &amp; Sister Mag. Oh we are a deeply afflict ed family. The family all send you &amp; all much love. My love to all enquiring friends. Good bye. Pray for us. Ever your Sister affectionately M. F. Harrison N. B. I got Bettie to ask Fannie to make a bonnet &amp; mantilette for me. I will get you Carrie &amp; Fannie to select the material &amp; patterns, but I dont think I can afford to go over $10 for both. I want them very plain. I hope Fannie &amp; Carrie will get over.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">near his bleeding side. Oh his love, his boundless Mercy. How it comforts me to think that while I loved him so much, that Jesus, yes Jesus, the friend of sinners, loved him much more. I never had a just idea of the character of my Saviour until now. I always felt that he was the Sinner's friend, &amp; showed great love in dying for us. I never knew how much I loved my husband until after he was taken from me, and oh, if he loved him more than I didaswe are assured he did &amp; much more, what must be the highth, the depth, the length, the breadth of his love towards us. I could write on this way it seems to me all my life, but I ought to stop, for I fear I have already written more than you are able to read. I hope to be with you soon &amp; we will then be able to talk &amp; commune much more satisfactorily. I am very anxious to see you but all of my friends over here are opposed to my going now. I wanted to go with Pa, but I will have to let them decide for me. My heart longs to get to the resting place of my loved one. I want to strew his grave over with flowers, &amp; bedew them with my tears. Oh I feel like if I could get there once I would want to go down to him &amp; press once more his lips. Sometimes I feel like there is nothing left me thats worth living for. My little children are still with me, but I feel that I am not fit to raise them without their father to aid me, &amp; that their friends would do a better part by them than I am capable of doing. I do want to feel submissive to the will of my heavenly Father. I want to feel more than I do all things have been ordered for the best: There is a spirit of repining about me that I want to get rid of. Oh it seems so strange, so hard that my dear husband was taken from his devoted little family, when others who care nought for their families, &amp; are not respected in the eyes of the world are spared. I fear tis a rebellious spirit &amp; I want it subdued. Oh I have so much to contend with. The little children are pretty well. Lucy has improved very much in last week. Little Minnie when asked where her Pa is says he dead, &amp; where he went when he died, she says to heaven. I sometimes ask her if she is going to try to be a good child &amp; go to heaven &amp; see her Pa. She laughs, claps her little hands &amp; says yes. I want you to see her. I know she would be a great comfort to you. She is beginning to talk a good deal. I came from Brothers last Saturday, they were very much distressed at little Franks death, but Pa was there yesterday &amp; said they were as cheerful as usual while he was there. I am glad to hear that Sister Mag is over for it distressed me greatly to think that she was kept ignorant of his illness. On my way home from Brothers I called to enquire after him, but he would not let me come away without seeing me, he looked very badly, &amp; was suffering with a blister I hope he will be well soon. I have to be constantly changing my place of stay, &amp; think of going down in a few days to see them at the University &amp; Mr. Stevens. My health is only tolerably good. I still cough &amp; suffer with my side. I sometimes think that ere long I will be called to meet my loved one in the happy land, where with his Father &amp; others who went before him, he is now praising him who bought him with his blood. Give a great deal of love to cousin Mary Kyle, &amp; cousin Diana. How is poor cousin Julia? I hope she is finding more comfort. Much love to her for me. And poor cousin Fannie Hunter. How much I feel for her, &amp; aunt Baxter. My love to them also. And to Mrs. Stevens, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Wheelwright &amp; all enquiring friends. I wrote to Bro. Wheelwright the other day &amp; asked him to write an obituary for the Advocate &amp; Register. I dont like the one published in the Town papers. It may be that you had better let him see this before he writes &amp; see if I mentioned any thing more to you than to him. The family one &amp; all send much love to you, Sister Mary &amp; Carrie. May grace abundantly be given us to bear up under our great bereavement, &amp; may all of us be greatly profited by it &amp; be better fitted to meet our dear one in Heaven is the prayer of your deeply afflicted daughter. M. F. Harrison Much love to Sister Mary &amp; Carrie for me. Minnie sends many kisses to all her aunts &amp; Grandma. (one sheet of a letter to her mother-in-law Mrs. Peachey Harrison.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Gessner HarrisonUniversity of Virginia Philadelphia, June 13th, 1852 My dear Eliza, Mary's letter brought us the afflicting intelligence last evening of the death of your dear infant. We deeply sympathize with you the Doctor, and all your children, who feel the more on this occasion because it is the first child you have ever lost. I know that in the first moments of privations of this character the consolations of reason are of no avail, and even those of religion are not sufficient to reconcile us to our misfortune, until time has come to their aid. Yet I cannot forbear to remind you that if you were destined to be deprived of your beloved child, it was better that he should be taken from you before he was yet more endeared to you, &amp; his brothers &amp; sisters, and that you ought to esteem yourself particularly fortunate that you have lost but one out of ten children. How often does it happen that amid the diversified occurrences of life, misfortunes do not come alone—thus you had hardly become reconciled to the death of poor Rush before your own promising babe followed him to the grave. May you have a long respite from these severe but necessary &amp; we must suppose wise dispensations of providence! Your mother's health seemed to have been so much benefited by her excursion to Baltimore that we promised ourselves it was completely reinstated—but we have found ourselves mistaken. She again finds that she must strictly adhere to a regemin that prescribes to her the articles of diet she least likes, and forbids her the use of every thing for which she has any appetite—and she cannot venture to deviate from it without a great risk of suffering from it severely. On the 24th of the month we set out for Baltimore &amp; the Eastern shore, and as we have promised to make a visit to Mr. Philip Cocke it will be late in July before we reach Albemarle. I went today after Church to see Dr. James Rogers, but was not admitted to his room. His case is deemed altogether hopeless, &amp; he is now confined to his bed. I greatly pity his family. From the continued accounts received that Mary's health was not yet restored, and an expression, of a desponding character, in the sweet letter she wrote me yesterday, I feel uneasy about her, and hope that she may be sent to some watering place this summer. Her trip to Winchester last summer seemed to have been of great service, and had she tried some of the medicinal springs her cure might have been complete. Mrs Lorenzo Lewis has been here on a visit to her aged father Dr. Cox. She is a very sweet pleasing woman, &amp; she expressed the liveliest &amp; kindest regret that Mary had not favored her with a visit. Your mother unites with me in regards to the Doctor &amp; the children, and tenders you her heartfelt sympathy. Hoping that this letter may find you restored to your wanted serenity, and that you, your husband &amp; children are in good or improved health I remain your affectionate father George Tucker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charlottesville Va.June 18 Miss Mary J. HarrisonHarrisonburg Va. Charlottesville June 18 1852 My Dear Cousin We arrived in Charlottesville Wednesday night about eleven oclock. it was one of the warmest days we ever felt. we also suffered very much with heat until it began ot rain when we felt as if we were in another climate. The Baby stood the journey very well indeed she was one of the best little things I ever saw cried but very little only when she wanted changing, she could not be attended too as often as was necessary on account of some strange Gentlemen sitting on the same bench with Cousin Margaret. The coach we were came over in had 12 or 14 passengers inside and out. There was nine inside with the Baby. one Large Man that counted for two that sat on the same Seat with Mrs. Stevens. We remained in Staunton until two I thought surely while there that we would burn up. it was so warm. Cousin Margaret and I had, the night we got to this place had to stay at the Hotel, which is very near the Depot. we could get no conveyance, she was afraid to walk. it very muddy &amp; damp, so we did not see William until the next morning. he looks very Holloweyed this morning, but says he is better and wishes to start home next week, but he will not be able I am sure. he sat up twice on yesterday, and said he felt almost well. The weather being so extremely Hot that it is enough to make any one sick. he complains of his Breathing not being very good this morning that is mostly all he complains of now, he has not fallen off a great deal I think. "What do you think" Cousin Margaret Lucy and Harry had the greatest time a vomiting yesterday I ever saw all three sick at once they had the cholera morbus in its worst form. The Doctor happened here at the time, he gave them opiates and they seemed to give no relief, and then he gave them calomel pills which gave Lucy great ease, but Cousin Margaret is still complaining this morning of sickness at her stomache and great weakness. I dont wonder after vomiting as much as she did, it was no wonder she was made sick, she rode backwards from Staunton here, and then those that were sick all eat fresh meat and cucumbers in Staunton. The Dr. said it was that made them sick, for my part I eat a few Cucumbers peas &amp; beef. I felt very sick when I got out of the cars here. I got along very well until night came on then my stomache was turned upside down. I hope by evening that Cousin M will be entirely well. The Dr says that she is very Bilious indeed, ought to have taken Medicine long ago, Lucy was well enough this morning to walk down to town with Sallie, rather imprudent in her after being so sick on Yesterday. It look right funny to see first one &amp; then the other go to the Bucket to vomit, it made the rest sick to see them, such a time I never saw. I was very sorry to find that Mary had gone home, she left last week and said she would come back in a short time. Sallie says she looks very much distressed and talks all the while about poor Rush, poor creature how sad her heart must be. I saw Mr. Rodes on Yesterday he told me she was very anxious to over with him, but he thinks she had better wait a little while longer. I dont auppose he will give his consent to take her this time he will be there at Court which is next Monday, he said he would send her into see us any time she wished to come. I have not seen any of Cousin Gessners family yet. sent your letter by Mr Rodes to him on Yesterday. I hope some one of them will come dwon to-day. Cousin Eliza is very anxious for Mary to let her have Lucy to nurse, but Mr Rodes is unwilling to give her up, as Rush give her to her before he died. I do think they ought by all means to let her have her, I should not think that Betties milk would be very good for her, her child being so old. Sallie is complaining some, but looks fat &amp; Hearty. William said yesterday he intended writing to you that he and the Baby were the only ones about. I think he would have messed it a little, I do hope that Aunt Polly will get better every day, and will be well by the time we go home. You must certainly excuse this badly written letter, for I am in a hurry to finish it to send it to the post office in time to have it sent by to-days mail. Bro. Bailey is here, tell Sister Wheelright that I have not fallen in Love with him as yet. I am glad that he does not know that I am the girl that she wrote to him about. Oh but he is homely, but dont tell her I said so. Maybe she mought tell him. They all send much Love to you all. Tell Mrs Stevens I know she wants to see Miss Willie. Write soon some one of you. From your Cousin Fannie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia June 20. 1852 My dear Mother, We have been much distressed to hear of your continued indisposition &amp; sufferings. Caroline said in her letter to Fanny that you had been very much afflicted with your stomach and otherwise. Mr. Wheelwright (whom we heard preach a very good dermon today at the Methodist Church in Charlottesville) said that when he left you were better; and I pray God that he may comfort and relieve you more and more. If you had only bodily afflictions, it w.d cause us grief to think of your pain and constant suffering: but that you should be at the same time bowed down with so sad bereavement, and called upon to sustain so great a burden of mental distress, fills us with sadness. Really, my dear Mother, it would be more than we could well bear, if we had not some confidence in our Heavenly Father. Remembering his word &amp; promises, knowing his goodness and tender compassion, and that He doth not willingly afflict us, nor without a gracious design towards us, we endeavor to be patient in tribulation also, and readily to submit ourselves to all his dispensations to us. I trust that you too are hourly and every moment simply and heartily relying upon the precious promises of God's holy word. How comforting to know that it is God that directs our way. That we may safely and joyfully commit all our ways into his hand, knowing that He will order all for the best. De we lack strength or any grace to do His holy will—we have only to ask in the name of Jesus, (our Advocate with the Father, our merciful High Priest, who is touched with the feeling of our infirmity) and we shall receive. Only let us ask without doubting, surely believing that he hears and answers our prayer. How suitable to your (and our) case was Mr. Wheelwright's text today (Romans Vlll. 32) "If God spared not his own Son, but freely delivered him up for us, how shall he not with him freely give us all things!" Having this greatest proof of God's love and mercy to us, can we for a moment doubt that he will bestow upon us all the blessings we need, whether they be temporal or spiritual? Let us be of good cheer, and all unworthy as we are, trust implicitly in our blessed Savior both as our Atonement and our Advocate. Let us bear patiently and even joyfully the afflictions and sorrows of life which He sees fit to allot to us, seeing that it is best just as He orders it. And, then, it cannot be long at the most until we shall enter into our rest. Our Divine Master has set us an example of entire submission to his Father's will, which we ought not to forget. We may, if we will, imitate this example. And why should we not? Our sojourn on Earth is but a preparation for an eternity near, very near at hand. He has been pleased to offer us a life of blessedness if we only are willing to take Him as our portion, and has graciously sent his Holy Spirit to help our weakness &amp; to enable us to do his will. Oh let us not faint through any distrust of His grace, but as we feel our weakness more, the more cast ourselves on Him. He will strengthen us, and give us great comfort and joy in believing in his promises. In trying to comfort and encourage you, I am trying to comfort myself. We have passed through a great trial &amp; sore affliction, in addition to our common loss, in the death of our dear Frank. But God has been good and merciful to us. Dear Rush had hope in his death, and we believe is safely housed in Heaven. And our lovely babe has joined the neavenly Choir above. This is comfort oh how divine comfort! We cannot doubt that this is a clear voice from God's Providence calling us to set our affections on heavenly things. And if Christ died for our loved ones, and has taken them to himself, has he not also died for us, and will he not, if we be faithful to the grace given, bring us to join them in the world of joy to which they have gone before? Surely we may believe this, and believing it, pass our time in humble trust in God, and joyful submission to his gracious will. Both Rosalie and Bob are somewhat indisposed, the former especially is very delicate and much reduced: but we hope she may be benefitted by some medicine she has taken. She seems much better today. Mr. Wheelwright promised to call tomorrow, and I may send this letter by him. I am so pressed by my I could not expect to write a line unless I wrote tonight. With love to the girls, Yr. son affectionately, Gessner Harrison We have seen very little of Margaret and Fanny since they arrived. They came in this afternoon, and Fanny remains tonight. Margaret of course returned. William is much better-considers himself nearly well enough to travel. Margaret was quite sick after she arrived, but is recovered.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Francis H. &amp; Edward B. SmithUniversity of Va. pr. Summerfield Leesburg June 21 1852 Dear Sons F. &amp; E. I send Summy as you wished it, &amp; as I believe it will be for his benefit both phisically &amp; mentally. He is your guest, take care of him. He is green, &amp; inexperienced, shew him the interesting objects in yr vicinity, &amp; I w.d advise you all to take excursions around the Uni.y &amp; so become acquainted with Albemarle. The man of pleasure &amp; taste, touched a little with the visionary w.d day let us see the N. Bridge, The Cave, the —— etc. but the utilitarian will say let us see yr canals, R. Rd farms, improvements, Lynchburg etc etc &amp; study the country, soils etc. I do not condemn the desire to see the wonders of nature, &amp; art, but not to make their study a primary object. Dont delay your return home very long. I should be glad to see you here by 4th July. Summy takes out but about money enough to pay his expenses. Edward may &amp; possibly will want some cash to pay up &amp; wind up the year. Francis will please supply him liberally &amp; I will refund him, when here. I did not know how much E might want &amp; considered it safer not to send too much by S. I hope Edward will acquit himself with credit &amp; honor to himself &amp; his father. Give him all the aid you can &amp; encourage him. You will find Summy as usual a precocious youht, ready &amp; witty &amp; flighty. Try &amp; inspire him with courage, self controul, &amp; confidence, he wants more of these &amp; less timidity. Make his visit agreeable. I want it to promote his good health. Dont let him become over excited. Advise him as to his diet. Let it be of the plainest kind. He is not to indulge in nick knacks &amp; sweets. I want him to write me immediately on his arrival. I have given him a letter of introduction to R. Colston Esq., if you choose &amp; think it advisable you can use it. I leave it to your judgement. We are all as well as usual, except my Rhumatic knee. Our love to you both. Your affectionate Father D. G. Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Ma chere Marie I promised you last evening that I would come to take tea with you today, and anticipated much pleasure in so doing. As circumstances however have developed themselves this morning I shall be obliged to forego the gratification. I shall, I fear, be unable to meet the demands of my examinations, even by devoting every moment to preparation. You will excuse me the rather, as you know nothing but the most urgent necessity could induce me to deprive myself of the pleasure of seeing you, and that too at a time when I have so few opportunities of doing so. I shall try to snatch a few moments to be with you before the end of the week. Till then, my own sweet girl, good bye. Yours most devotedly F. H. S. (Francis H. Smith to Mary Stuart Harrison)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sherwood July 5th My dear Eliza Mr. Rives is going to Court today, &amp; if possible will get up to see you. I write a few lines to request you to tell William Dunglison how much pleased I should be if he would come out to see me. I wish George could come out with him. I would send the carriage up for them, but tomorrow I am engaged to go to Mr. Douglas's, E. has two young ladies staying with her Mary Willis &amp; a Miss Kennie from Staunton. I shall invite them to spend a day or two with me. M. Ross will return with me to attend with me a Convocation in the Green Mountain church to begin on Wednesday and last until Sunday-two services every day after the first. Of course though I shall not be able to go every day. I am much disappointed that you cannot come out at once but hope you will as soon as you can. I should be very glad to see Caroline with you if her stay would admit of her coming. I think George ought to have a change after such close application. I was much gratified to hear of his honours. I could send up next week for him and two of the other boys if you cannot come so soon. I will know what a void is left in your heart by the loss of your sweet infant, and how long it will be before your mind can dwell upon him without a pang of bitter sorrow. which may be indulged with resignation to the divine will. I am truly concerned to hear of dear Lucy D's situation. I trust by some miracle she may yet be spared. Mr. R. waits. I must conclude. Yours etc., M. R.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg July 6th 1852 My dear girl I have recruited myself by some of the substantial comforts of life, have brushed off the evidences of dust &amp; tiresome travel, and feel tolerably well prepared to come into the presance of a lady. So I make you my politest salutation &amp; beg to enquire how you have been since Sunday evening—the occasion upon which I had the honor of last addressing you. You see I have not waited for an answer from my sweetheart before writing again to her,-an encouragement, I trust, to her to "go and do likewise". I hope she &amp; I will agree to banish all meedless conventional formalities from our intercourse epistolary, as we have nearly done from our personal interviews. In sincerity however I do not know that I can claim any credit for not awaiting a reply from you on the present occasion, for I was really ashamed almost to send you the letter I did, (which I presume you got by this day's mail &amp; are probably now reading), I am the more provoked at it, because I learned afterwards that my haste was needless, the mail closing at 9 o'c, instead of 8 o'c, as I had been informed. So you may take that &amp; this together to make up a letter. And if you are so good &amp; kind (as I hope you will be) to reply to both, I shall consider the second as a gratuitous free-will offering of your love,-one of the numerous exhibitions of affection which my dear Mary has given me. When I wrote to you last, I gave you a short outline of my movements up to Sunday evening. On Monday I expected to see a great deal that would be interesting, it being the day upon which the celebration of the 4th was expected to take place, but, doubtless with many others, I was disappointed. Barring a good deal of noise produced by firing cannon, pistols, crackers etc, &amp; the parade of some companies of soldiers and firemen, there was nothing done. I wished to go down to Alexandria in the morning. It happened that at the same time a delegation of Washington democrats were proceeding to the same place, to hold a barbecue, &amp; a gentleman who was marching in the procession advised us to fall into the line &amp; march with them, as those in the procession would probably be the only ones who would be able to get on the boat. I did not wish to lose the opportunity of getting to Alex.a, &amp; so, without a moments reflection, we three joined the march-&amp; there we were, 3 staunch Loudoun Whigs, marching down Penn.a Avenue in broad daylight, with thousands of spectators (among whom I feared there were some (students or others) who would recognize me), &amp; before us the broad banner of the "Jackson Democratic Assoc" or something of that sort, I felt most uncomfortably ridiculous there, sweating along under the enemies colors. Thought I to myself "this will be a death-blow Frank Smith, to any political aspirations you may have". After marching a mile thro' the dust, I contrived to slip out to the sidewalk &amp; so left them, "And when this associa.n next doth march abroad" "May I "not" be there to see". I wish I could say the disasters of the day ended here. At some unlucky hour, I heard of a Sunday School picnic to be held in the woods near Bladensburg, at what was painted to me as a delightful Spring. So Summerfield &amp; I got on the cars at 12½ o'c &amp; in a few minutes we were on the ground. We found collected a large number of girls &amp; boys, of small &amp; large growth, some swinging, some surrounded a place where ham &amp; bread were dealt out gratis, but the greater part looking to see what the others were doing. The place was not very pretty-&amp; we had now gratified any little curiosity we might have felt at first. Then for about 5 mortal hours we were terribly bored, having to wait for the cars at 6 o'clock. We were glad to get back to the city again, &amp; at 8 were gratified with the sight of some curious fireworks in the rear of the Presidents grounds. This morning at 3 we started for home, &amp; as you know already, reached Leesburg safely. I found my relations all well,-the old town as dry as ever. I have not put my nose out of doors yet &amp; consequently cannot tell how my old friends are. I begin to feel lonely and dull already, &amp; my dear love will guess the reason. However kind &amp; affectionate friends &amp; kinsfolk may be, they cant supply the place of a warm, confiding, sympathising heart, &amp; that the heart of a woman. I feel desolate away from you. While living in an atmosphere that breathed of love &amp; devotion, I thought little of its true value, not considering that there could be any different state of circumstances, but when one feels that chilly gaze that tells you, you are a stranger, or encounter those who can not attune their own feelings to his own, then it is that the priceless richness of a reciprocated affection, the value of a pulse that beats more quickly at the mention of his name, is most deeply felt. Such are my own feelings, dear Mary. To you I can turn, when all others turn away. Your heart will respond to appeals, which might be lost on others. I shall ever find an advocate there, no matter how many my accusers may be. My love, you have thought, I know, at times that I doubted your constancy. Whatever my conduct may have led you to imagine, I assure you it is &amp; has always been the most gratifying reflection to me, that you loved me well &amp; constantly. I put as implicit faith in the depth &amp; ardor of your affection, as I do in whatever I believe most firmly. I prize it as the richest jewel I possess. I have thought, since seated here, that not much over 100 miles from here, you are now reading or sewing (or doing something else you ought not), I can imagine you there, &amp; O! the cruel fate that limits our bodily capacities, while our imaginations are unrestrained. To be mute in the presence of my love, even when that presence is imaginary. Can you not divise some spiritual telegraph to supply this want? I know my dear, dear one remembers mw when she kneels before her Heavenly Father-&amp; prays fervently for me, as I now pray for her I have had sore conflicts of late, if that can be called conflict in which there was scarcely any resistance. How much is there in the past, which, with its effects, I would give worlds if I could to blot out forever. Sorer trials, I fear, await me, &amp; perhaps very soon. You, my own love, who feel for me, will you ask God to save me? A fervent, effectual prayer of my Mary's may-will avail doubtless. If in some unguarded moment, I am betrayed by myself, I fear the result. God bless &amp; crown you with his most gracious benedictions Let us hope that all will yet work for good. Good bye, my own dear Mary F. H. Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Washington July 7 1852 Dear Bro. Smith Since I last write to you we have been called to mourn the irrepairable loss of Henry Clay, whose equal as a man a statesman and patriot our country has never had, and perhaps never will have again, save in the case of one whose equal we never expect to see—I mean George Washington. But Henry Clay died, as did George Washington, in the hope of the Gospel which brings life &amp; immortality to light. His remains were taken around by the Lakes to Cleveland O—thence to Cincinatti and thence to Lexington to be deposited in a Tomb in that City. We followed Him as far as Baltimore, and spent the fourth and fifth of July there. We returned here on Tuesday, and our absence is the reason for our not attending to the frame etc, desired in your last. It shall have my carliest attention however and you shall receive it as soon as posible We have very hot weather this week, but we blessed with usual health and desire to feel thankfull I have engaged Tombstones in Balt. for my Father, Mother, and Erasmus. Shall I have them sent round to George Town or shall I send them by the Pt. of Rooks? I would have had one for Sister Cassa also, but I do not recollect the date of her birth or death, and have to have it made another time. Congress is now hurrying business and expect to adjourn by the first of September. The man has not reported yet on your Bozzell case. Hope you are all well. In haste. Most truly M. G.

      <field name="fulltext">Wesleyan University July 7th 1852 My dear Frank I have been thinking a great deal about you tonight and it is no more than right that you should know it. But the thought strikes me that if I write I shall not know where to direct. Never mind, if my letter never reaches you you'll not be a great loser. I am determined to write. If I only knew to what point of time you were posted up it would be very comforting, but as I do not you must consider yourself the one at fault if I repeat some things which I have already written. I think I told you of Mr. Suters and Landers conversion with full particulars. I wrote too about Andrews visit to Middletown, and about Prof. Lindsays engagement! but you have not heard of my visit to Boston, during the session of the General Conference. I spent two weeks among the Massachusetts Yankees much to my pleasure. Stopped a Sabbath with George Steele on my way to B. We went out together and exercised our "gifts and graces" quite as much I fear to the amazement of each other as to the edification of our hearers. You may have heard and you may not of George's marriage. He assumed new responsibilities one week ago tomorrow morning. The ceremony was performed publicly in the chapel of the inatitution by the Principal. Prof Lindsay was married too three weeks since. His bride creates a great sensation here among these quizzing yankees. Really she is a fine lady. If all your Southern ladies appear as well I shall surely find my way to Maryland or Virginia ere long. You don't speak very "much at length" about your future prospects and intentions. I presume however from incidental remarks that you intend to return to the University another year.Are you decided to seat yourself in a professors chair for life, or will you by and by become a good old fashioned itinerant? Seems to me I should be glad to hear you preach, as indeed I am inclined to believe you have "a call". We are now in the midst of senior examinations. Four weeks from today comes commencement. Will you be with us? In your last you certainly gave me reason to hope so, I cannot promise you that same nice little iron bedstead for Herrick too is married and has left us with all his personal effects, but I promise you still better accomodations, better in every respect, I cannot particularize. Our "Bill of Fare" is about as attractive as usual, some say more so, but I am hardly willing to subscribe to this. Judge for yourself. Adam Reid of Salisbury and Park Benjamin before the Public Societies, President Allen of Gerard before the "O B K" and President Tefft of Genesee Cty before the Alumni. So far as commencement is concerned I can only say that the graduating class speak well of their own powers, and profess themselves determined not to be a whit behind the illustrious class of /51. But why should I speak of all these things. You would not be induced to come here for the sake of witnessing any literary performances. Whenever you think of visiting us, and begin to weigh attractions you do not ask what great men will speak there, but who of my old friends shall I see. Now I can only answer you in the most general terms, by saying that we look for a large representation from the class of 1849—Miller, Brown Andrew etc. Van Vleck too will be here. His interest in the affairs of the institution seems to be increasing. I know of no graduate who visits us so often. He is actually Burred to us. I spent a few days with him at Cambridge this spring to my great enjoyment. His situation though not altogether such an one as I should fancy is still on many accounts just the place for him. No other one of his class receives as good a salary as he ($1000) and his native fondness for figures enables him to extract poetry and eloquence from logarithms and sines. The future is all dark to me yet so far as any definite plans are concerned. Sometimes I feel quite inclined to take a full theological course and again I am disposed to enter upon the duties of my calling forthwith. I have told the authorities here that I shall not remain with them another year for my present salary-so I suppose I shall leave as they can find ambitious young men in abundance who will be willing to serve them for a pittance. On the whole, I am heartily glad I came here. The year has been filled with comfort, and I think not altogether destitute of profit. It is a shame to leave this sheet unfilled but I am called away and theres no help for it. Remember me to all who are dear to you— and let me hear from you immediately that I may not be in suspense about your visit. Aff.y Yours A. S. Hunt</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Francis H. SmithLeesburg Loudoun County Va. University of Virginia July 10th 1852 My own dear Frank I cannot tell you how much pleasure your letter gave me yesterday, and I have scarce thought of anything else since. I received it, but its contents and the enjoyment I should derive from answering it. Unfortunately however this morning found me suffering from just such a fit of languor and debility as the day before you left (only not quite so bad) and in everything I attempt to do I feel as if some heavy weight were attached to me clogging and fettering every thought and means of expressing what I feel. I only tell you this Frank that you may find some excuse for me if I send you a dull stupid letter in return for one which interested me so much. What a treasure a letter is when it comes from the hand of an absent loved one, and no words could tell you how much I prize each one you send me, but at the same time while it gives me such delight, it makes me long to see you so much that I can with (torn) feelings of impatience for the time to come when we shall meet again. I think I can say with truth Frank that you only do me justice in saying that I feel for you in every thing, and I am so grateful to you for valuing my affection so highly as you do, and I hope you may never have reason to repent of having loved me. I do pray for you continually my own dear love, and if my petitions are weak and unworthy they are at least heartfelt &amp; sincere. We should both pray earnestly and longingly to have our supreme effections centred upon God and heaven that the very fountain of our life being thus purified and sanctified, we may love each other with pure hearts fervently, our hearts being cemented by the purest of all ties, that of Christian fellowship. I think sometimes, you know thoughts will not always be chained, that when we all meet in the heavenly world our affections will not at all be influenced by former ties such as relationship and like things, but we will all see each other as we are, and our love be excited by only such things (torn) lovely thus two closely in heaven move in far different and such as consideration should move us to seek together our higher interests, and if we would wish to spend an eternity with those we now love, to strive continually to be one in Christ and to move heart and hand together in every good word and work. Thus bringing our spirits into close and inseparable union, and all that is spiritual must live forever. So we may deduce good even from our fancies sometimes. Mrs. Davis, I am glad to say continues to improve. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Holcombe with Miss Alice &amp; Mr. Saunders left home yesterday. William Dunglison also came to take leave of us and goes to-day. By the way, you bad boy, I must scold you when I see you for keeping a secret from me. I have found it out though notwithstanding. Mr. Kean came in on purpose to tell me of his engagement, and I have not heard anything that pleased me so much for a long time. Poor fellow, he has suffered enough to make his happiness tenfold now, and he says he is the happiest man in Christendom. I was very much disappointed last evening by hearing that Lucy Downing had given up going to Rawley (torn) pleasant little trip there but Mr. &amp; Mrs. Minor go are going Monday she cares for. Aunt Mary is going to Harrisonburg next week, when of course I shall accompany her. If I am there at the expiration of your four weeks you must come there and be my escort home. Mr. d'Alfonce brought me sixteen crayons yesterdau besides what I already have, and I have not even drawn a stroke since his last lesson. He intends staying here the whole vacation I believe. I received a letter from Maria in Culpeper in which she tells us Eliza is as captivating as ever. The little thing received three nice presents before she even reached the end of her journey. She had not yet seen Cousin Betsey. One thing only distresses me Frank in your letter that you seemed to be in bad spirits. Now my dear one you must cheer up, for you have every thing to comfort you, a loving Saviour, kind friends, and if I am not at your side, I am thinking of and blessing you here as the very joy and prop of my life. You say there is in the past what you would give worlds to blot out, but you ought not to forget St. Paul's injunction that we look not at the things that are behind but press forward, and however heinous our offences may have been, yet if we have repented of them they are forever blotted out from the book of Job's remembrances. Why then should we look back but in thankfulness for having been plucked as firebrands from the burning, and an incitement to redeem the time while yet it is day. I have been so negligent as not to deliver Somerfield's message to the boys, for I never thought of it when I saw them, but you may give my love to him, that is if there is no objection. George is waiting anxiously to know if your brother Edward can go with him to the Natural Bridge etc Mr. Wertenbaker had already sent the letter when George inquired, so you must doubtless have received it ere this. Good bye, my own dear precious Frank Ever your devoted Mary</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Mary Stuart HarrisonHarrisonburg Virginia University July 21st 1852 My dear Mary I was very glad to get your letter yesterday. It seems to me a long while since you went away. Monday Hannah took her departure &amp; Sophy came. Mrs. Wineberger was willing to give $4 but thought 5 more than she could afford. One can hardly judge in so short a time, but I should say she was a very superior servant. I like her spirit &amp; manner of getting to work. I shall be better able to tell by the end of the week. The McGuffeys have been in the country at Mr. Rogers and Mr. Terrell's. Mary is still at the latter place. Henrietta came to see me last evening, and desired her best love to you. She complained of feeling very lonely. Lucy Downing said she hoped you would soon return, she xpected to be here the greater part of the vacation. She also sent her love to you. I heard from Maria yesterday through Dick who has been to Culpeper recently. She will be at home Friday. I have been disappointed in getting no letter from her. I understood she had been writing about a good deal. It would seem that the world is getting more and more wicked. I presume you have seen a account of those shocking murders in Richmond of the Winston family. I do not know when I have been more shocked than at hearing Margaret (who lived with me) had been put in jail and publicly whipped for an attempt to poison St. George Tucker's infant and whipping Gilmer very severely. I have not been able to hear the particulars, but this is the rumour about the matter. Although I knew her to be a bad woman, I never supposed she was wicked enough for such conduct as that. I will be exceedingly glad to get the socks you mentioned from cousin Sally Leslie, also to enter into some arrangement with respect to butter etc, We can arrange this matter after you return We have forwarded you some three or four letters, you have of course received them ere this. George is waiting anxiously to hear again from Edward Smith, before he can leave. Mrs. Davis continues to improve steadily, and will leave home as soon as she is able. The Minors go on Monday next. Pelessa Hall went home last Friday and brought her sister Ann back with her to work for Mrs. M. I am a little fearful I shall lose my nail, my finger does not get well as fast as I hoped.it would. As it is nearly bre breakfast time I must conclude with desiring that you my best love to your father, grandmother, aunts Mary, Margaret, Caroline, and Mary K. ever your fondly attached mother E. L. C. Harrison P. S. I fogot to say the boys were Charlie suffered a good deal with a Often wished pa was here to open it, and finally took the lancet himself, not being willing that anyone else should do it. Bobbie is talking most affectionately to Hala as he calls the cow, he says "how do you do Hala" and once said if you don't speak to me I'll knock you down.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University July 23rd 1852 My dear husband, I was very sorry to find from your letter how much indisposed you were, I trust by this time you are entirely well, and able to transact business to your satisfaction. I hope your Mother will continue to improve in health, and that I shall hear more favorable accounts of her. Mrs. Davis continues to improve steadily. She is anxiously looking forward to the little trip she intends taking, and hopes to be well enough by the first week in August. A letter came from Mr. Hamilton the other day asking you to lend him some money, he wishes to attend the Alum Springs I believe he said he was expecting funds probably about this time. George has not gone yet, he expects Edward Smith to-day, but of course there is no certainty about it. I got a letter from papa a few days ago, he seems much encouraged about the Chicago property, he has sold two of the lots for $1400 to be paid in five payments, 280 I believe in cash at once, the others annually. He thinks no way in which the money could be vosted would be so advantageous as holding the lots, and merely deriving sufficient revenue from them to pay the taxes. He says they sold for $400 more than he expected; a convincing proof of their steady rise in value. George and I walked to town this morning before breakfast to get Mary's silk, which I hope will suit. I unfortunately lost the bits she sent, but I thought I recollected the colours. She will doubtless be surprised and pleased to see the McGuffey's who have recently received a letter from Mr. Buffner inviting them to Harrisonburg—they intend leaving this morning or afternoon I believe in the stage. Maria, from whom I received two letters a day or two since, will not be at home until Wednesday or Thursday next, they remain longer to see Mr. Wm. H. Broadus, and Mrs. Broadus. All the family are well, saving Flora, who is somewhat complaining. My best love to your Mother, Mary, Mary Jane, Mary Rush, Margaret &amp; Caroline, Ever your truly attached wife E. L. C. Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1852 August Directions for Francis &amp; Edward Rise early, say regularly at 5 oclk. at all seasons. Retire early, between 9 &amp; 10 oclk. Pray much &amp; regularly. Read your Bibles constantly at least 1 chapter every day. Read the bible through if possible once a year with other good Books. Keep good &amp; sensible &amp; virtuous company or none, be upright &amp; just, good &amp; liberal, kind &amp; respectful. Lead an active life, try to be useful. Exercise freely, 2 or 3 hours every day. Walk much, &amp; run &amp; ride. Sing a good deal to strengthen the voice. Keep yourself erect, arms back, head up, be on your feet generally while reading &amp; studying, throw out the chest, breath deep &amp; long, run to improve your wind. Use the cold Bath freely to clense &amp; strengthen the system. Use little medecine. If the head is full &amp; aches &amp; is dull &amp; heavy, promote an evacuation of the bowels, by injecting a pint or so of cold water, slightly coloured with cast steel soap, or add a teaspoon full of salt or use an effervescent draught made of 1teaspoon full of Supercarbonate of Soda (not sub car) a half spoonfull of Tartaric acid mixed in separate tumblers of water about ½ full add to the soda 2 spoonsfull of Rochelle Salts, which may or may not be sweetened with loaf sugar. Mix well, then add the solution of Acid, drink while effervescing. This will opperate in 2 or 3 hours. If this does not relieve, take on retiring to bed one or 2 of the blue pills &amp; 1 of the ippecac Do. These may be followed in the morning by a draught of the aforesaid effervescent mixture. This will answer for all ordinary slight attacks of ailments. The Blue pills are made of the best London Apothecaries Hall Mass (Blue Mass), the Ip. pills are made of ½ grain best Ippecac. These the Ip. pills are good in slight affections of the bowels. They are soothing &amp; quieting. With a wise care of diet, regular habits, judicious exercise, a quiet &amp; cheerfull mind, little use will be needed for medecine. I should add a firm reliance upon your God, a strict attention to his commandments &amp; observance of His precepts, is always safe &amp; imperative. May our blessed Heavenly Father ever have you in His care &amp; keeping. Bless &amp; preserve &amp; prosper you is the prayer of your best friend &amp; Father. D. G. S.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">( Part of a letter from D. G. Smith written in 1852) I just rec.d a long &amp; affectionate letter from old Bro. Furlong. He gives me a pretty full history of his family affairs &amp; expresses still his preference for Leesburg. Thinks it a better place &amp; better society in it than Hagerstown. We expect to invite him to our reopening on 5th proximo. (we also expect Collins, Busey &amp; M. G. Hamilton). Bro. F's son Henry, a very interesting young man &amp; preacher has fallen into bad health, is quite infirm. He is now in Balto Co. &amp; getting better. We shall have a beautifull church. Shall have the walls frescoed. The painting is nearly completed &amp; looks very nice. The c. mt.g near this place was large but the results were small. The Loudoun C. Mt.g commenced on Saturday last- one week ago. There were but 3 sermons preached from the stand, so I am told. It is said the grounds &amp; roads were awfully bad. I was in Middleb.g on Tuesday but would not venture out. None of the big guns attended except Thos. Sewall &amp; he but a day or two. S. Keppler was there &amp; did well. The weather is alarmingly wet, while you in Albemarle it is said are very dry. The wheat stacks here are green with sprouts, &amp; no doubt injuring, so with hay in stacks, &amp; the corn although looking well is not doing much in the way of maturing. I saw Dr. Burt Gray yesterday. Said he saw you in Rockingham etc. He is to marry in a few weeks with a Miss Tyler, miece to Mr. Wm. B. He will settle &amp; practice in Charlestown, Jeff. Co. Let me suggest a theme for reflection &amp; perchance a stimulous to your christian faith. At least an encouragement to your christian feelings. Man is a doubting creature. His faith is often weak, so much so that the Blessed Saviour complains "Oh ye of little faith." and again "Slow of heart to believe." Notwithstanding the plain declarations of Gods word we often have an undisguised dread of annihilation, cant believe fully in the immortality of the soul. I will now suggest an idea that may serve to confirm your faith. Man is a progressive being. None other of Gods creation is like him. The animals are perfect in their nature &amp; instinct, the bird forms its first nest as perfectly as at any subsequent period. The young Bee forms as perfect a cell as the older &amp; more experienced. But man is imperfect in all his efforts. The mind is ever grasping &amp; never satisfied. His powers are constantly developing. The most unremiting efforts of man &amp; the higheest attainments are unsatisfactory to him. This proves the immortality of mans nobler part, because although we say constant changes are going on (in) the world nature never changes. This is an eternal law the effects of causes remain the same. Carry out this reflection.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of VaAug 22 Mrs. Mary HarrisonHarrisonburg Va. University of Virginia August 21st 1852 My dear Grandmother Agreeably to my promise I sit down this evening to give you some little account of the incidents of our journey, and to let you know that we have arrived safely. From Harrisonburg to Staunton it was pleasant enough as there were only two passengers besides ourselves, but when we left again in the afternoon, by the negligence and indifference of the stage agent we were permitted to get into a stage which was to go only as far as Waynesboro, and after suffering no little anxiety lest we should be dropped there by the other coaches which were considerably in advance of us, we at last came up with them at the tavern, but only to find them full and the passengers not at all disposed to be obliging. The agent however compelled them to let me enter one where there were six grown persons and 4 children. You may well imagine that I felt as if I were delivered into the hands of the Philistines when Mr. Smith got on the outside and left me among such savages, but there happened to be one young gentleman who was so kind to me that he quite made amends for the rudeness of the rest, and afterward when he found out from Mr. Smith who I was, he said that he had become acquainted with pa at Old Point and we became very friendly before we parted. This morning we got here as early as half past six and found them expecting us. Mr. Smith visited the Asylum and hospital while we were in Staunton, but I spent almost the whole while in my room, reading an interesting book I found on the table at Mrs. McClung's. Pa and George left on Thursday so I missed seeing them They had not decided positively on the route they were to take, so that there is no certainty of their visiting Harrisonburg but it seems to me altogether probable that they will. Pa expected to be absent only for about 10 days. Mr. Tutwiler wrote to tell pas that he would pay him a visit the first of September and we are all anticipating much pleasure from seeing him. It has been so long since he was here that I do not recollect at all how he looked. When he sent his letter he was in Baltimore and expected to go as far North as Boston. Mama was very much obliged to you for the lima beans and beets and we all enjoyed them to-day at dinner. Fowls are very plentiful here and Ma wishes she could find an opportunity of sending you some chickens The University looks exceedingly desolate now. There is not a single family on the other side of the lawn. Dr. Howard and the two little girls returned this evening and Mr. Courtenay is looked for next week. To my surprise I found Peachy at home, he came in yesterday from Aunt Maria's on foot and seemed to be but little fatigued by it. I believe he was feeding his chickens in about half an hour after he got home. Mr. Broadus and Maria will come home to-morrow if Mrs. Whitescarver is atall better. I have been busied all to-day in putting away my clothes and fixing up my room and as you may suppose feel quite tired now which must be my excuse for so short a letter. I found Bob's head more bald than ever and he seems to have grown a good deal even in the few weeks of my absence. Ma joins me in love to you, Aunt Mary Jane, Aunt Mary Rush, Aunt Margaret and Aunt Caroline. Kiss Minnie and Willy for me. Ever your affectionate granddaughter Mary Stuart Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">My dear Mother: Carrie's long"looked for" has come at last, but I believe I will stand to my resolution to write to you. I would have written to you before this but my sufferings and interruptions have been such as to render it almost impossible. I am extremely sorry to hear by Carrie's letter of your increased indisposition &amp; sufferings. Tis comforting to know that afflictions and sufferings are of God &amp; his hand meeteth only enough to accomplish his design with us, which is always for our good. A perfect reliance upon him, an unwavering faith in Christ &amp; a willingness to submit to him to do with as seemeth to him good is his will always with the children of men &amp; if this be gained the promised reward is sure. I trust much grace is given you, &amp; you are being made perfect through sufferings even as our glorious Redeemer was made perfect by his sufferings here. He has suffered much yea much more than any human being has ever suffered &amp; can &amp; does sympathize with you, but look to Him &amp; he will enable you to bear—all is the chastening of your Father in Heaven &amp; you will be made more mete for the enjoyment of those pleasures reserved for you at his right hand. May you be mightily comforted &amp; supported is my prayer I am still suffering greatly from my ride over-my bowels were made exceedingly sore by the jolting across the mountains it must be some time yet before I entirely recover. You know that whenever they trouble me, I suffer much from depression of spirits &amp; I have suffered greatly in this way. I sometimes think tis rather increasing than otherwise. I feel so lonely and desolate sometimes that I almost wish for death, but I am still determined to strive to trust God and submit to his will concerning me. My dear little ones are pretty well, &amp; are as much petted as ever-sometimes I think more so. Lucy at least. The whooping cough is here &amp; I am sure they will have it. I fear some for Minnie-her constitution being weaker than Lute's. Pa has made an engagement with Mr. Keagy to take their Daguerotypes, &amp; I hope to get them before they take it &amp; if so you shall have one. I am very sorry tis here, because it has caused me to give up all hope of seeing Sister Mag. &amp; Willie here this fall, &amp; even if they should come to the University I cannot see them. But in this as in other things we must submit. I am glad to tell you that Brother is improving. He is looking better &amp; is walking &amp; riding about a good deal, has gone to see sister Bottie today to stay some days, within the last week has gained five pounds. His disease is almosy exactly like Dr. H's his physicians feared greatly for him &amp; were candid enough to tell him. His spirits are pretty good now, &amp; he is greatly encouraged to hope getting well again. He doesn't give into my plan of going to Taylor's Springs-the alum water (the Doctors say) is what he ought to drink, &amp; he prefers being at home to any where else. Johnnie is complaining a good deal tonight from being in the dust made by threshing wheat, I hope &amp; think tho' that by morning he will be relieved. Pa &amp; Addie aro complaining of their throats, the rest are in common health. I have not seen any of Brother's family since I came over, nor even heard from them that I recollect of. I am going to write to Sister next week I hope, wished to do so last, &amp; this week, but could not. I did hear of Maria's foot. Have you heard from her lately? The weather has been hot &amp; dry, the corn crops are suffering greatly for want of rain, &amp; vegetables are getting short too. The apples are all falling. I often wish you were near enough to share with us. Lucy says I must tell "Damma" she has pretty chickens &amp; she &amp; aunt Fanniem &amp; aunt Mary &amp; aunt Mag &amp; Willie must come to see her &amp; live with her. Minnie sends kisses &amp; love to you, her aunts &amp; Willie. Ma, Pa, &amp; all unite with me in sending love to each &amp; all. I hope to hear from you soon &amp; that you are better. Good bye. Heaven bless &amp; preserve you is the prayer of your lonely, afflicted child Mary Say to Sister Mary that owing to the drouth, &amp; the ground hogs we get no good watermelons now, if we get any good ones I will cut some pieces for her. I expect to write to Carrie next week. If Fannie comes home next week give her much love &amp; ask her to enclose a copy of the pattern she got off of Sis Mag's sleeves. I lost mine by some means.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg Va.Aug. 30 Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Leesburg Aug. 28th 1852 My dear son Francis Your expected letter was rec.d today (dated on 25th inst) inclosing Bank check for 300$ which you loan to me at interest. Above you have my note for the amt., made payable on demand, not knowing when you may have use for it, so that you can call for it at any time. I wish for your sake it were 10 or 20 fold larger, but you are entering life now as an independent member of the great human family &amp; must begin to struggle for that respectable position that you are so capable of occupying &amp; must begin to work for a competency for comfortable living. You have taken a first safe &amp; proper step by saving &amp; investing a part of your annual earnings. "Spend less than your income" is the true secret of successful in life. You say you have not rec.d a letter from us since you left. The reason is obvious, you were on the wing, &amp; could not be located long enough to be reached by a letter. You speak of a journey on foot, proposed by your friend. Be carefull not to tax your strength too much. If you go make easy stages &amp; if you find it toilsome, take a carriage occasionally. I have no doubt but it would do you good. Cant you get to Leesburg again? We should all be glad to see you here, to spend a week or two. Take some pains to get Edward well located. I have urged him to attend to it by writing etc., but he will depend upon your good offices in that behalf. Dont overlook it. It should have been arranged earlier. It is important to get a good room &amp; mate. Your page of notions shall be amply attended to. In the mean time write often. We will send you the papers. There are several of your periodicals here which Ed will take out when he goes, or if you wish it will send pr. mail. We are all as well as usual. G. Mother us very feeble, still in bed, not able to sit up much. Sandys Ed is in bed with measles. I left there on yesterday, came by from Leedswood, where I found my cattle etc. satisfactory. Uncle John, Mary &amp; the 2 small children were here this week. They came by Middleb.g &amp; stayed a few days at Camp Mtg. It rained all the time &amp; is now raining, water high, wheat injuring in the stacks, no sun except on yesterday for a week or 10 days, &amp; looks as if it w.d rain a week longer. Our love to you. Yrs. affectionately D. G. Smith I will write a longer letter next time. (Monday morn 30th) Fine clear weather yesterday &amp; this morning &amp; bracing &amp; promises to continue.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore Sept 1st 1852 My Dear Cousin Margaret I was very glad indeed to hear from you and Dear little Williet, and was truly sorry to hear that she was still not very well, but improving daily. I am afraid she will be a little Beauty break all the Boys hearts. Caroline writes that she has such winning ways. Bless her heart I say. I do want to see my little Pet the worst of all things. I wish she was well, I feel very anxious about her all the time. I know she must look sweet sitting on the floor. I imagine I can see her trying to clap her little hands. Well I have finished the Sack, I hope it will fit and that you will be pleased with it. A white one would have been prettier, but I thought this would be more serviceable. Maybe some time I will make her a White Cashimere. They are lovely embroidered, but I am not certain that I could do it as John says. The Blue Sack will look very pretty over white dresses. I know she will look very nice and seet in it. I am afraid that it will so much admired, that I will get more to do. It costed one Dollar. Do you think that was too much, and if I had bought all the silk to have worked it with, it would have costed a good deal more. Fannie Bailona gave me a greater part of it. You must certainly write her it fits and how you like it as soon as you get. I intend sending the things by Mr Houck, he told Dilman that he was coming down to see me. I also got the gun cloth for Williet. I only got half a square, thinking if you wanted more I could very easily get it. It was only 37½ cents for the half square. Anything you want write, and I will get it with pleasure, and especially if it is for my little Dear Williet. I saw a very sweet looking Baby the other day on Market Street, it was Dressed in white with it sleeves tied up with Blue Ribbon, and two Gold Bracelets on its wrists. I thought how sweet Willie would look, dressed in the same way. Dont you think she would. I was truly sorry indeed to hear that Aunt Polly was still so complaining. I do wish she could get over that sick stomache. I wonder what is the cause of it and hope too that Aunt Baxter will soon be well. I think John Stuart treated us very shabily in not letting us know that he was in Mt Jackson. I didnt know it until I received Carries letter a few days ago. I would like to know if he got his money. I saw Mrs. Shacklett and Fannie the next day after they arrived here, she told me that she would carry anything that I had to send, but as she is going through Fauguier I thought I would send the things by Mr Houck. You would get them much sooner. She is now in Philadelphia will return the last of this week. Fannie is going to school to Mr Archer on Lexington Street. I shall go to see her before very long. she insisted upon my coming. Yesterday I went out shopping, hoping to meet some one I knew and sure enough who should I see but Tiffin Warren. I called to him and he came over and spoke to me, said that Lizzie was at Barnums wouldnt I go to see her. I told him certainly. he gave me his number and not hers, so I knocked at his door, and she wouldnt let me in for a long time, thinking it was some one to see Tiffin. I kept on knocking and finally she opened the door and said how glad she was to see me. I sat with her until nearly Tea time. They expected to leave this morning for Annapolis. she is going to a wedding, One of her schoolmates is to be married in a few days. Tiffin says his Health is very much improved since he left home. he is looking quite thin and Lizzie is as fat as a beef, rather a coarse comparison you will think, but dont let her hear I said so. I was glad to hear that Mr Stevens had improved so much Raleigh must have aggreed with him. Mary thought she felt a good deal better after her return from Old point, she does look better I think. I staid all night at Mrs Browns Monday night, the first time since I have been here she allways asks after you all whenever I see her. Maggie started Tuesday morning to Staunton to school it seemed a great trial to Mrs Brown to part with her, she has improved very much since I had seen her last and is nearly grown. They seem always glad to see me whenever I go there. They insist upon my staying some part of my time with them, but I am very well pleased where I am. I am beginning to feel no longer a Stranger, can walk out by myself and find my way home again. We went to the Aged Womans home lastwweek, what a nice place it is for old Ladies who have no one to take care of them. When you go there to live you have to pay one hundred dollars, and then you have a Home for life, without any further trouble. Dont have to do anything unless you feel so disposed. I think it would suit Mahalie if she was a little nicer with herself. It is a Beautiful Building near Franklin Square I think they ought to have one for the Aged Men, on the next Square Then they wouldnt look so lonesome. I have at last succeeded in finding Mrs Suman, on High Street near Mrs Chambers, where I have visited two or three times every week since I have been here. she said that she had been looking to see me but all in vain. she will leave this week for home. I will go to see her again before she leaves. I would like very much to see some of Mary's poetry about her Dear Husband. how sad you all must feel whenever you look at her. It makes my heart ache whenever I think of her lonely state. Give a great deal of love to her for me. Ask William if he dont think that I had better have a certificate if I wish to join the Church I can do it and if not I can let it alone. I thought maybe it ought to be attended to before Bro. W. left. I am not anxious about it I do assure you, but I know one thing they will take me if I wish to join. I have more to write but my paper is full. Who sent me that letter from Harrisonburg last week. Did you know who it was from, and what it was. (Unsigned letter from Fannie M. Stuart. E. D. G.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore Sept 2, 1852 My Dear Caroline I was truly glad to hear from you again. I thought it a long time since I received the last. I happened to be away the evering your letter came. I staidwwith Mrs. Brown for the first time. I assisted her some little in gotting Maggie started. she always wants to know if you are coming. They treat me very kindly indeed they would.nt let me come home Teusday evening. I was obliged to stay. I was very sorry to hear that Aunt Polly was still so complaining. she can stand Blisters better than I could to have as many on. They certainly do relieve her a great deal. I do wish she could get over that sick Stomache that she has so often. I feel very anxious every day about her, wishing to know how she is getting on. And Aunt Baxter too. I thought she was getting well on Tomatoes and Raliegh water, but you say that she has been very sick again. tell her how sorry I was to hear that she was worse and give my best love to her. I often think of my Dear Aunts who are sick and give my best love wish I could see them. I reckon I will hardly get back this Winter. I haven't fully determined what I will do yet. I have not seen Mr. Houck since he has been here. he told Delman that he was coming to see me but has not yet, he will leave in the morning for home. I bought Cousin Mary Jane a pair of shoes No 6-the 5½ seemed too narrow at the toes I thought for her. I shall be sorry if they dont fit her. They are good shoes I judge. I gave 1.12½ for them. I prioed them at other shops. They asked me 1.25 for Shoes that were nothing like as nice. I do hope they will please. Mr. Houck could.nt carry them with him, but Dil took them up this morning, and will peck them in with his goods some he bought at this firm. You can go over when he gets his goods for them. I send the thread also. The little sack he will take with him in his Trunk. I have been looking around for Mourning Collars but see none that I would oven let alone buy for any one else. I have made no engagement for working at Bonnets yet. I called in at Miss De Goys one day as I was passing. I asked them if they knew Mrs. Nicholas. They said Oh Yes. When did you hear from her. You worked with her did you not. how they knew I couldn't tell. They said she was not much of a millener. I asked them if t they were supplied with hands for the fall. They said that they only wanted one firstrate hand at making Bonnets. as I dont orack myself up as anything extra, they (dont) want me, and I dont think I shall want them, although they told me to come back this week, but I shant go. I have a strong notion of going up to Mrs. Leonards to see what she has to say. she lives some distance from here. Mrs. Brown wants me to go to Mrs. Coburn, the Lady that Lin and Lou Ward had such a fuss about. they have quite a nice Store on Gay Street. I have been on it and met with Mrs. Coburn at Mrs. Brown's. I dont know where I will go. John Stuart is mean for not letting us know that he was in. I had a little business with him myself. I was sorry to hear that Willie had been sick. Dilman got a letter from him in which he said that they had another Son. Hurrah for the Stuarts in Pulqski. All the Boys from Harrisonburg come to see me. Joe Dougherty, Nelson Bell and James Rogers. Mr. Bell came Sunday Night and gallanted me to Church, and is coming next Sunday evening at four o'clock to go to the Cathedral. he has very kindly offered his service while I stay in the City. Aint he kind. he is very steady now, still a methodist. What charge cane Mr Kyle have against me. I cant think for my life. andsso Mary Bird has caught the fortune at last. how in this world can she fancy him, it cant possibly be the Man, it must be the Money that strokes her fancy. I am so sorry that I shall miss the party at Mr. Kyles, and maybe Mary would have had me at the marria then I might have had an opportunity of riding in Bounapartes carriage. Wont I miss it by being away. I have no doubt but that the Birds are highly delighted with the match. the sight of him never would make my Heart jump out of my mouth I know. I heard that they were coming to Balt after the marriage. I want to see them. do let me know if they come. If you determine to come this far Dill says you must write and he will meet you at the cars. Do be so long about making up your mind. tell Ed to come on to Balt. I want to see him. I went with Dill to the Wheat field to see Mrs. Shacklett &amp; Fannie. I was very glad to see some one from home. the appeared glad to see me, whether they were or not. I had to stay there a long time on account of its raining. We were invited out yesterday to tea at Mrs. Parks, I believe there were ten or a dozen Ladies, and but one Beau. so much talking you never heard amongst those Girls. Mrs. Parks is a very nice Lady. she is an intimate friend of Mary's. My Sister Mary is complaining a great deal of her Back. she suffers very much with it since her illness last Spring. She enjoyed herself very much at old point but made quite a short stay. I do want to see Minnie &amp; Willie so much. Tell Willie she had better not get so sweet to make everybody fall in love with her. Bless her Dear little Heart. She is one of the greatest Babies in my eyes that ever was. If you come be sure to let us know in time. I dont suppose I can go with you to Charlotte ville if you should decide to come, it would be nice if I could make it suite. I was very glad to hear that Jinnie &amp; Mary Pollock were improving so much. I do hope they will get well. And so you haveggood Meetings these Latter days, it does my Heart good to hear such news from my Church. I pray that you may have a good Meeting. Give my love to Aunt Polly, Cousin Mary Jane, Mary Rush, Emily Pence, Margaret &amp; William and Mrs. Logan, Dilman and Mary send love. Tell Mrs. Houck that I have not seen anything new in the way of sleeves for the fall. Why did Quin move his Store to the old Tavern, I thought he was fixed for life. Write soon. From your Cousin Fannie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harrisonburg Va.Sep 22 Rev. John A. BroadusUniversity of Virginia Harrisonburg September 21st 1852 My dear Husband After waiting for the arrival of the mail with some anxiety in hopes of receiving a letter, I was more than satisfied by getting two, from a hand that I much love to see. I sent to the Office Saturday night but the trifling boy, Bob, brought no answer, although now, I am sure, the letter you wrote in Staunton must have been there. I was rather pleased to hear that you did not have to preach Sunday night, as the anxiety you would have felt might have undone in a measure the good effects of your trip. But the request you made of me in reference to that sermon I do not consider as concerning that one alone. I shall always as far as I am able connect you with myself in my attempt to pray. Ever since we were married and indeed before, I have tried daily to ask for you those blessings which some directly from Heaven and tend to make us all supremely happy. I have often feared that it might be wrong in me who know not how to pray to venture to ask for such things for another—but then again it seemed that it was right—that in praying for myself I ought to pray for others, above all for one so dear to my heart as my husband. I wrote to you of my troubles Saturday. Sunday morning came and I had not yet made up my mind, I wanted to go but was afraid I was too anxious to make myself a Christian—I didn't want to go, for fear that others might think I considered myself such &amp; I knew that all I could say was that I desired to be a Christian. When the hour drew near, Grandma asked me if I was not going &amp; said yes I must go in answer to my objections, then Aunt Mary Jane asked me and with her advice in addition I determined to attend. We went together to the Church where there are two class rooms—one of them we entered and found that Mr. Wheelwright would lead. It was the first time I had even been since I was a very small child and I felt very solemn, &amp; desirous of finding it of benefit to me. The feelings with which I left however were not what I had anticipated. I felt humiliated, more disposed to sorrow than be comforted; and I believe it did me good, for I fear I have been too much inclined to think I had become a Christian than I had any right to do. I believe that in my heart I wanted some one to tell me that I was converted, even although I knew that would do no good unless I had the evidence in myself that I was changed, born of the Spirit. I am not discouraged though, for the promises still hold good to those who are striving to come to God through the merits of his Son. Seek and ye shall find is the language of Christ himself, the God that cannot lie, and by his grace I shall hope that he will not always be angry with me and that I may yet say, My God is reconciled His pardoning voice I hear He owns me for his child I can no longer fear With confidence I now draw nigh And Father, Abba, Father cry. I have taken a great deal of room but I know that this page is for the eye of one who will sympathise with every feeling here expressed, and who would rather his wife should write them, than keep it all closed up in her own breast. Sunday morning Mr. Wheelwright preached from Lamentations 111.39.40, a good sermon but not at all extraordinary. In the afternoon Linarsed Lida and at night went to prayer meeting, which is always a pleasant thing to me. Monday, the whole family including me went hard to work for Aunt Caroline as she had concluded to go with a party which was to leave this morning. We hoped to make the greater part of a dress for her, but after all, she &amp; Cousin Fanny together will have to spend some time on it to finish it. She packed up last night and set off immediately after a very early breakfast this morning. I gave her $2 to purchase some worsteds for mats for my piano and some edging. Tell Mary if she wants anything she had better write soon as she does not expect to stay more than three weeks if she comes back here, but perhaps she will go to the University on her return. From Cousin Fanny's last letter I think she will certainly return to Harrisonburg this fall, she seemed to be cuite homesick. You will be sorry to hear that both Lida and Mother have been complaining a good deal since you left. Lida's cold troubles her at night so much that I have to give her hive-syrup and have her neck and breast rubbed with Oil &amp; Camphor. She has waxen kernels under her ears which have very much the appearance of Mumps. Martha says she must go home with her baby as mountain air seems to have such a bad effect. My complaint is of a different sort. You may recollect that I was talking a good deal about my tongue. As it continued to grow worse I was becoming very uneasy, fearing it might be Thrash as Aunt Mary said it looked like hers, so Sunday night I took a good dose of Rhubarb &amp; Magnesia, which made me very sick in the might but made me feel better by breakfast time. My tongue though is very sore still, but not so painful as it was Sunday. I hope it will not last long and at least prove to be of no serious character, such a thing as the Thrash for instance, to last for months. My cold is better and I am very well except my tongue, so that you must not feel uneasy about your little family when we are surrounded by Doctors too. Grandma says I must tell you, Your Grandma says you had better come back as Uncle William has never thought of the Corn since you left. We all laughed at your being so much disturbed about it. When Papa comes I reckon he will see to it so it will all be well yet. I believe Uncle William will wait until then to decide about Harry. I am sorry I could not see Grandma &amp; Grandpa again, but it could not be well arranged for me to see them now I suppose, as they left this morning, according to their plan when I left &amp; when you wrote. Aunt Caroline will be in Baltimore when they get there I reckon, but not in the same direction. Give my love to Ma, Mary, Mr. Smith and the boys. I shall hope to hear again through Papa from you. I should have written yesterday but for being so busy. I hope you will not find this letter so illegibly written as the one to Mama. Good-bye dear John. Your fondly attached wife Maria C. Broadus (RSH)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Va.pr E. B. Smith Leesburg Sept 23 1852 My dear Son Francis Edward will start tomorrow for the Uni. &amp; I write you by him `a la Scott' in haste having so much to give my attention to. Will write more at length when I have more leisure. I ret.d from Balto yesterday after a short visit, purchased but little of Hardware, I had intended to get your silver ware, but deferred it for a season. There is such variety to choose from I could not select without consultation at home. More of this in future. Grandma is very low &amp; weak. We think she is sinking gradually. May our Good Lord be with her &amp; sustain her. The rest are well. We have many mercies &amp; have great blessings from our Heavenly Father about which we ought frequently to think &amp; for which we ought to be constantly thankful. I need not exhort you as to your plain duties. You ought to be well instructed. Go on resolutely in your course of improvement in mind &amp; morals. Be determined to excell, &amp; give "aid &amp; comfort" to Ed. Watch over him as one who must give acct. Let the Smith family look up &amp; aspire in the ascendant to usefulness &amp; worthiness. The field is large &amp; the watchword is Progress. May our ever kind &amp; good Heavenly Father have you &amp; all of us in His care &amp; keeping is the prayer of your affectionate Father D. G. Smith P. S. You say something of a farm about which you want to see at 12000$. See it &amp; give me a very full description of it, its location, neighbors, water, fruit, wood, buildings, soil, convenience to markets, road, transportation &amp; schools, churches &amp; also its healthfulness or otherwise, which is very important. If not too flat, but rolling &amp; pleasant, not liable to wash by rains, good neighbors, good waters etc etc etc it might do. What is the character of the surrounding lands &amp; what farms. The farm might be like Belmont below Leesburg, good looking but worthless land.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Gessner HarrisonUniversity of Virginia Philadelphia Sep 29, 1852 My dear Eliza, We arrived here without accident on Saturday last, and being entirely without servants, wre obliged to board two days at Miss Plumstead's. We have now two—a cook &amp; chambermaid, who promise well &amp; after our house is thoroughly cleaned &amp; the carpets down, we expect to be once more in comfort. Your mother has been evidently much benefited since she followed Dr. Harrison's advice of taking nothing after dinner. She has had no symptoms of her complaint from that time, &amp; I trust will continue to do well. Your bordering goes off today with the looking glass &amp; Maria's tea in one box to the care of T.J. Peyton, whom I shall request to forward it by the railroad. I inclose the bills for the bordering &amp; the glass. The former is a neat pattern, but is not so prononce in its colours as I could have wished. With a great variety to choose from, the rest were either too wide or too narrow—too gay—or ugly or of unsuitable colours. I found a letter in Charlottesville authorizing me to draw for $500—tho' Berger had not sold all his tobacco— as soon as I have that the money is in Richmond, I will send Dr. H. a cheque on the bank there. Beyer's crop has turned out even better than I had expected. The dealers who sold the cottage furniture offered to put in a new glass without charge if I would undertake to say that it was broke in consequence of bad packing, but that of course I could not do. They however charged for their work the lowest price. Our regards to all—I am Your affectionate father G. Tucker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Leesburg Oct 1st 1852 My dear son Francis Yours of 23d ulto is rec.d. I am concerned at the disponding tone of its tenor. You must not distrust the Father of all our mercies. He has been so kind to you in all your ways, ever taking care of you, can you not still trust Him? I regard myself as a child of Providence, without any definite object at the commencement of my active life. I resolved to do my duty, relying upon His gracious guidance &amp; protection. So far the Lord has dealt graciously with me, tho the path of life has been strewed with thorns, yet He has mercifully kept me aloft, and safe from the malevolence of enemies, of whom I have had my full share. Your prospects in life I have flattered myself were very encouraging &amp; bright, look on the bright side my son, hope in God. You are the subject of many prayers. In regard to your little ailment, `nausea' I conclude that it proceeds from your disturbed state of mind, it is a symptom of dispepsia. Get a piece of best Turkey Rhubarb root and carry it in your pocket, eat a bit as large as a cherry occasionally say once a day or every other day to keep the bowels open &amp; regular. Go to the privy every morning within ½ an hour after breakfast, whether you have the natural prompting or not, and thus compel nature to yield to habit. Dont neglect this. A blue pill (5 grains with ½ gr. of Ipecac will be usefull when there is great lassitude headache, &amp; indolence of the liver which is indicated by whitish stools etc, but you have the best medical aid, to which you can resort if necessary. Still I would advise you to refrain unless indispensible necessity should require it. Try a bottle of Cherry pectoral, or Sands Sarsaparrilla. I have as you know entertained a doubt of the propriety of your engaging in the business of school teaching, because of the confinement, and its effects upon your health, &amp; have urged you to decide for yourself. I wrote a letter to you by Edward asking you to look at farm mentioned by you in one fo your letters, some 20 miles south of Char'ville, &amp; had concluded that if it suited you I would endeavour with your assistance to buy it for you. I could sell the B.d Run for 5 or 6 thousand &amp; could add some 2000$ to it say 8000$ if you could manage to raise the 4000 out of the profits of the farm &amp; out of your salary to pay the rest say in 3 years, after which, should the Good Lord spare us I c.d aid in stooking it for you. This was one scheme. Another has providentially presented itself. You spoke of Leedswood, this seems inadmissable or inapropriate for the purposes. I had occasion some 2 weeks ago to visit Mr. Peter Greggs who has a pretty little farm with a fine brick home on it, about the size of R. W. Grays here but somewhat out of order. The situation is however beautifull. It is situated about ½ mile only from Benton's academy, which is ample &amp; has a dwelling capable of accomodating 20 odd boarders. Wm. Carr who is now teaching there Mr Gregg says had 40 odd scholars last year 20 odd of whom were boarders. D.d Carr the father of Wm. is in treaty for the purchase of Dr. Clagetts farm, Woodburn, which, if he gets, he intends for Wm., who will remove there, in that case you could rent the Benton establishment. (240 or 250 dolls rent) &amp; commence a school, under I think auspicious circumstances. I can get Greggs farm, upon which I might move &amp; be near to you. If this scheme meets your views let me know soon, &amp; I will ride up &amp; make all necessary inquiry. Of course you could not get possession untill next autumn. Let us consider this matter seriously, in the mean time. The neighborhood is good, &amp; a very beautiful country around, as you may recollect—it is in sight &amp; adjoining Ludwell Lucketts, &amp; within 4 miles of Mid.lburg to which place there may be a road soon. The situation w.d be central between my farms. It would require to accomplish the enterprize a considerable amt of money, but I think I c.d manage it. May God aid us. My son I feel constantly the utmost degree of concern for your happiness, of this however you have no need of further assurance. I suppose E.d has arrived safely with Powell H. Take some pains to shew some interest for Powell. His father feels great anxiety for him, &amp; somewhat intimated a hint that he felt a desire th you sh.d notice him. Seemed pleased to have E.d to accompany him t school, asked me yesterday if I had heard of their arrival &amp; wishe me to tell him when I should hear etc etc. Your poor old grandmother is very ill &amp; in a critical state, seems wearing away more rapidly. May the Lord bless her. I sold my cattle to Mr. Gregg (60 head on Leedswood) on which I make over 500$ profit. He has also engaged Daily's 35 head on which I shall make over 250$ &amp; have yet to sell 36 head at Butlers on which I hope to make a corresponding profit. This has been a good year for grazing. I shall have for sale at all my farms some 10 to 12 hundred Bus wheat &amp; say 400 Bbls corn. Cheer up my son &amp; hope for the best. Encourage Edw.d. Be strict in your religious duties. Trust in God. He will bless you. Your affectionate father D. G. Smith We have a revival of religion in our church. It is tho small quite encouraging. Mr. Busey from Balto was with us &amp; preached to admiration He is in every respect a christian gentleman. We had 6 mourners last night &amp; 2 converts, all females. It is growing bette Write often &amp; E.d too. I subscribed for the Chronicle for E. Tell him to prepay the postage 13 cts for the whole year under the new law. However he had better only pay for 9 mos. as he will be here 3 mos at vacation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paid 3 Leesburg Va.Oct 11 Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Leesburg Oct 11th 1852 My dear son Francis Yours of 5th inst is at hand. I had been expecting a letter from E. &amp; got it a few days ago. Tell him to write often &amp; that I will write him soon. I hope his new location will be pleasant to him. You seemed to regret his choice, but do not say why. I hope his associations will not injurious to him. He is so steady that I have but little fear of him, yet I charge you to notice him strictly. Summy informed you both of our poor G. M. departure. Although she was so much of an invalid &amp; was conrined to her room, there is still a gap left which makes home a little gloomy. We have reason to trust that she is better off. In regard to the matters about which you are so highly interested just now. I shall have time to think about &amp; enquire about soon. A man just now called to enquire about B.d Run &amp; says he will look at it. I cant say how soon a sale could be effected, if the necessity arises I can try it at Pub. sale. I will go up to Lisbon in a few days &amp; make all inquiries about the prospect etc etc &amp; will let you know. In the mean time make further inquiries about Alta Vista. I should like first to inspect it before purchasing. I do not recollect whether you stated the no. of acres in the tract. You may have done so to E.d but I have forgotten. My impression is that there are about 1000 acres. You say 300 acres are in wood &amp; that it takes 10 hands to cultivate the lands. If so there must be a large amt cleared. Butler cultivat ed 350 acres with 3 constant hands, occasionally hiring others. If the land of Alta Vista is good &amp; the Estate is a great bargain I could make the first payment without selling B.d Run, say 3000$, by getting a temporary loan &amp; if I go to the country &amp; sell out here my property here, Houses, lots, mill &amp; store would realize some 8 to 10 thousand dollars &amp; I have honds &amp; accts worth 10 thousand which w.d enable me to work along, health &amp; life continued. My income from farms &amp; rents is some 2500$ at the lowest calculation But I would prefer as you w.d I have no doubt to sell B.d Run &amp; so be enabled to get on easily, stooking the farm etc. Let it be understood that I must see the farm ere you purchase &amp; I will now inquire by what route I could reach it most expeditiously. In the mean time let me suggest that we shall have time enough to arrange for your settlement within the year that you will be employed at the Uni. I have conversed with yr. uncle Edward who thinks that if your health will remain good that you had better continue at the Uni. as long as you can &amp; in a casual conversation with B. W. Harrison I mentioned your scheme. He replied that you ought by all means to continue at the college. I merely mention these things for your reflection as in the contemplation of a change in business all of the circumstances &amp; matters connected ought to be well considered. I like your plan of an independent school It would suit well for both you &amp; Edward, &amp; if a good Providence will so order the matter that you should settle near, Summy &amp; How.d could so easily avail themselves of the opportunity to get their education much more satisfactorily to myself. My great anxiety &amp; prayer to God is that I may be able to start my Boys well in the world, in that business that will insure to them happiness &amp; usefulness. I know the perplexities of your mind. We are so short sighted. Let us refer the matter to that wise &amp; good Friend who has always directed us. I find that watching the openings of Providence &amp; profiting by those indications is a safe course. I suppose you wish to fix the time of your marriage. If do let me know what is your wish as to that event &amp; keep a cool judgement at work on all these subjects. Write often &amp; I will write again as soon as I see about the Lisbon school. With great solicitation for your health &amp; happiness, I am yr aff Father D. G. Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harrisonburg Va.Oct 12 Mrs. Mary HarrisonUniversity of Virginia Harrisonburg October 11th 1852 My dear Mother: We are thinking a little strange of not hearing again from you by letter. Pa came over last week and brought a very favourable account from you. I hope you will continue to improve, &amp; will be sufficiently braced up to stand the winter pretty well. Time seems long since you left &amp; you don't know how much we miss you. I dont reckon I ought to have told you this-dont think about it—we will all do as well as we can while you are away. We are not as lonely now as we have been. Carrie got home last friday evening, &amp; Fannie on Sunday morning &amp; make home more cheerful. Carrie is looking pretty well, &amp; was very much pleased with her visit. Fannie I think looks rather badly, &amp; not so cheerful as I expected to see her. She complained of fooling badly all day yesterday from loss of sleep on the night before. After resting &amp; sleeping more I hope she will feel better. The dreaded sale is over. Oh! I felt that I would have given any thing I have in this world if you could have been here. It came upon me like a thunderbolt. I didn't know it was going to take place then, until the day before Pa came. Ah! I cant tell you how I felt and still feel. My husband is gone &amp; his books, medicines &amp; every thing are scattered, &amp; with them goes my heart. My every wound opens deeper, and bleeds more freely than ever. I am beginning to feel that I am a widow, that nought but sorrow &amp; desolation is mine. But with this I must stop. Old Mrs. Gambell died on Saturday evening &amp; was buried at the cemetery on Sunday. Mr. Bell preached her funeral at the stone church, a most excellent sermon they say. I did not go-it was raining so much that I was afraid to turn out. Sister Mary &amp; Carrie went—they said the family, Miss Bell especially, seemed most deeply afflicted. No doubt she has made a happy exchange of worlds. We have not heard from Mrs. Lofland for several days &amp; I presume she is living still. Mr. Stevens has been complaining of his side a good deal for several days but is better today. Joe came home with his mother last week—he is looking very well &amp; is talking of going ever the mountains next Wednesday. Virginia conrad speaks of going with him to Charlottesville &amp; stay a while &amp; then she will go to Richmond to spend the winter. She looks very much improved, though she says she fools very little better than when confined to her bed. Old Mrs. Conrad was a good deal ailing a few days ago, but is better I believe. I did not hear what was the matter with her. Virginia Miller has been ill too, but is better they say. Poor Malinda Nicolas we fear will not be with us long—she is very feeble indeed. I believe she has given up all hope of getting well. 'Twill be a great trial to Mr. Nicholas I know, to give her up, he is so devoted to her. Willie is very sprightly &amp; interesting. Fannie thinks she is the smartest babe that ever was. Sister Mag. is here now, &amp; is very well. We are making another short dress for Willie. She looks very sweet in short dresses. Minnie is getting rather jealous of my sowing so much for Willie—very often asks me why I dont sew some for "Minnie". Sister mary expects to send a box to you by Miss Haddie Bear. A cap for you &amp; a collar &amp; some worsted for Maria. Minnie sends her love to her grandma &amp; says she wants to see her, &amp; sis, &amp; Lida. Sister Mary, Carry, Fennie and Sister Mag all unite with me in sending much love to you, Brother, Sister, Mary, Maria, Mr. Broadus &amp; all. Kiss Lida for us. May the Lord take care of you is the prayer of your deeply affectionate child. Mary Miss Bear expects to start over the mountains in the morning. Aunt Baxter has gotten home, &amp; is pretty much as usual. Sister Mary bids me ask you to say to Sister that she is very much obliged to her for the nice preserves &amp; jam &amp; jelly. They came very opportunely as she could get no peaches to use in any way. I ought to have said something about them when writing before, but was so absent minded, that I did not think of it while writing. Sister Mary made apple butter last week &amp; dried a peck or more of apples. Again good by. Mary I have just received a letter from Maria. Say to her with much love I will write to her soon. Sister Mary says her apple butter is delightfully sour &amp; if the boys will promise to eat it, she will send them a crock of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg Va.Oct 18 Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Leesburg Oct 18th 1852 My dear son Francis I had an interview last week with Mr. R. Colston who was here on a visit. I enquired about Alta Vista. He was well acquainted with its character location etc according to his acct it would seem that it has been in market a good while. He spoke rather disparagingly of the quality of the land, mentioned several gentlemen &amp; names who had been induced by the glowing representations of a Mr. Rives the agent for the widow to sell it, to visit it, but none could be induced to purchase after examination. He said it was composed principally of the light chesnut soil, easily blown away by the wind &amp; unsusceptible of improvement. He remarked however that for situation it was beautiful, &amp; would answer for a gentleman of wealth to live upon, intimating however that it could not be made a profitable farm, in quality it was of the general character of that part of the country. He did not wish me to be governed by his judgement, but advised me to go &amp; see for myself, which if you persist in thinking advisable I will do. Last week I took a ride to the Lisbon neighborhood, &amp; spent a night with Mr. Wm. Benton the owner of the school house &amp; dwelling now occupied by Mr. Carr. His school is not quite so flourishing thus far as it was last year. He has but 12 to 15 Boarders now. These may &amp; no doubt will increase. He had last year boarders from Balto, Alex.a, Winchester &amp; other places from a distance. I inquired of W. Benton why Mr. Benjamin Benton discontinued his school. He replied that B. B. was fickle &amp; probably an infirm state of health had had something to do with it. He had got up a rather flourishing school, a good aparatus etc. The country surrounding is a very pleasant and inviting one. The neighborhood is good. Mr. Jno. A Carter, J. P. Dulany, Lucketts etc are tolerably near. If I get Peter Greggs farm it will be central between Goshen &amp; Leedswood, 12 &amp; 18 miles from each respectively. I have engaged the school house conditionally, or as they say here have the refusal of it for next year if Carr leaves.Mr. W. Benton designs the teachers dwelling which is a beautiful &amp; comfortable one, large &amp; commodious—for one of his sons after awhile as a farm house, he having some 1000 acres of land in a body there, which he intends to divide. Mr. Carrs school last year as I understood was about this 22 Boarders @ 100$ for 10 mos $2200 Tuition 20 to 40$ average 30 for 22 660 20 pupils not boarders average fee 30$ 600 3460 Contra House rent $240 Provisions, wood etc for school &amp; boarders say 1500 2200 servants hire etc 210 1260 contingencies 250 leaving for furnishing house &amp; school &amp; clothing for home family etc etc. I understood however that Carr is clearing 2000$. If he can do this could not F. H. S. a graduate of the Uni. of Va. with the highest testimonials of capacity etc etc double or treble that. We will continue to agitate this subject, &amp; make every inquiry so as to be well posted before we act. I suppose that it would require an outlay of 2000$ to furnish a boarding home &amp; school to start with. Your private apartments would require 500$ school &amp; aparatus 300$ 15 or 18 beds for boarders 300$, chamber furniture 150, cooking utensils etc etc the balance. I took dinner with Jos. P McGrath near Lisbon who is of opinion that a good school could be established by a competent teacher. From what you say of the style of living in your part of the country creates an objection in my mind to it. Extravagance is so characteristic of Va. Loudoun Co. excepted. This will not do for a new beginner. Economy with industry only will insure independence. We must learn the value of pence &amp; tinn. Suppose you should conclude to come to Loudoun &amp; commence a school &amp; should not succeed to your satisfaction, could you not then try farming. With the Blessing of God who sparing my life &amp; health, I hope in cooperation with my boys to establish them in independent stations, always relying upon the aid of a good Providence &amp; our own experience &amp; sober judgement. I can sympathize with you in your perplexities. I myself passed through all the anxieties of a commencement in life, the misgivings, uncertainties &amp; doubts, attendant upon all human enterprizes are so well calculated to perplex one. We cant penetrate the future. Therefore the real necessity of trusting in a Good Providence. He will open the way for his faithful servants, never fear, if you design to promote his glory. He will take care of you if you are true to Him. May he Bless you &amp; reassure your mind. Encourage yourself in this reflection. We are well. Our love to you &amp; Edward. from your Father D. G. Smith We rec.d a letter from o.d a short one. I will write him soon. I send him regularly the Chronicle. Does he get it? Aunt Anna is here on a visit. Our Ag. fair comes off tomorrow. It will not be a very imposing one. It is the first. Your Ma will contend for the Prem. on Butter. Weite often &amp; if you have other objections to Loudoun state them expicitly. When you and E.d write say something about Powell Harrison. His father inquires every few days whether we have heard &amp; what you say about Powell etc but neither you nor E.d have named him in yr letters. Aunt Harriet is getting more reconciled. She has bo.t ½ of the Tusca Mill for 800$ &amp; pd for it. I have not yet got my stock cattle. I have had several inquiries about B.d Run farm. I may possibly sell it, but upon long credit if I do. Daily does not like to give it up. It really looks well now so much grass upon it. We have fattened 36 head of cattle on it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charlottesville Va.Oct 21 Miss Mary Jane HarrisonHarrisonburg, Virginia University of Virginia October 18th 1852 My dear Aunt, I wrote a letter to send by Mr. Joseph Stevens, who expected to leave to-day, but as he determined to remain until Mrs. Stevens should seem better, we thought it best to write by mail and not send that letter. I mention this that you may see I am at least a day or two later in writing than I had expected to be, but the variety of little matters that occupy my attention must be my excuse for not having written last week. As the weather has been very delightful lately I suppose you have concluded that Grandma was getting on as usual in regard to her health; and so it is, she says her cough is no better but thinks her strength has increased somewhat. She &amp; Mamma expect to go to Aunt Maria's to-morrow to stay about a week I reckon. They looked for the carriage to-day but Mr. Rives came in and told them that in consequence of some farm arrangements it would not be here until to-morrow. We all feel very uneasy about Mrs. Stevens. Mr. Stevens wrote in reply to a note Mama sent to Mrs. Conrad, that she had been suffering intensely for 48 hours, but he hoped she would soon get relief. The child had not then been born—late this evening the note was written. I do hope she will get over it safely, but there is much to be feared from such prolonged suffering. Mrs. McGuffey seems to be getting much better—she goes to Mrs. Courtenay's and to her father's and can eat what she pleases now, so that I hope she will pass through her trial without any very serious result. Grandma just heard yesterday from Mr. J. Stevens the issue of the Sale, and was a good deal disturbed that Old Coly was sold. She was very anxious to keep him and thinks she would have bought him if she had been at home. She wants to hear from you all very much, with especial reference to all matters of house-keeping and management in general. She wishes to know what has been done to the Cistern as the perfect silence both you and Aunt Mary maintain on that subject seems to intimate that it stands as she left it. She wishes also to hear something further about the fodder and the gathering in of the winter supplies. Among other things she wants you to have the corn in the small lot hauled home in the wheel-barrow by the boys; the husks taken off in the cutting-room and the corn dried to make bread. Aunt Clarissa must fill up the Celery to put it in a fair way to grow. How is Clarissa coming on? Grandma would like to know. We have never yet heard anything from Aunt Caroline about her trip—can't she be persuaded to give us some account of it. Tell her I am very much obliged to her for the worsted etc. and must give her credit for being a most satisfactory shopper, at least as far as my commissions extended. Mary would like to hear from Cousin Fanny about her bonnet. The fall is advancing and she would like to know whether she bought one or is going to make one, and when she will send it to her. Grandma feels sorry that she cannot go back home with Mr. Stevens and Miss Lizzy Conrad, but her visit is not out yet and she is not ready to go. She has been expecting to return when Mr. Rodes some time ago spoke of going—the last of this month or the first of next. But she has not seen him since he came back and does not know what he intends to do; though she heard he was going over next week perhaps. She wishes to know if you want her at home. Tell Aunt Mary when she comes, Grandma wants her to bring some of her pieces of poetry and the letter Aunt Mary wrote her, in the top drawer. And when you have an opportunity you might send some apple-butter, if you have it to spare, as the boys like it so much. We were glad to hear that Aunt Margaret was going to stay with Mrs. Ross. I am sure she will be pleased, for they are such exceedingly kind and amiable people. The new Professor and his wife arrived last Thursday, and we called on them Friday. They are staying at Mr. Rogers' until their house is furnished. Hearing that she had been the belle of Louisville, we felt a little apprehension lest she should be too much of a fine lady as not to feel at home with us. But on the contrary she is very simple and easy in her manners and I hope we shall find her a pleasant neighbor. Grandma says she wants to see Minnie very much and sends her love to her. The family unite in love with me and Grandma to you and all the family with you, and Aunt Margaret and her family and to Aunt Baxter also. Your affectionate niece, Maria C. Broadus P. S. I must apologize for writing the same thing over twice as I wrote the letter at different times and forgot I had mentioned it before. I mean the place I scratched out. Grandma says tell Minnie her little sister is the sweetest little baby she ever saw, she is afraid she will be prettier than Minnie is. Yours etc., M. C. B.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Mary Jane HarrisonHarrisonburg University of Virginia Oct. 18th 1852 My dear Aunt, Again I have been behindhand in writing, but I think I could present very good reasons for my delay if I should enumerate all the various little matters that have occupied the time I had intended to appropriate to writing. However I think I might find some fault with you about this same matter, for although Aunt Mary wrote immediately after my letter reached you, still there are many things we should like to hear about more particularly. Grandma just heard to-day through Mr. Joe Stevens the issue of the sale, and was a good deal disturbed that Old Coly was sold. She was anxious to buy him and thinks if she had been at home her plan of keeping him might have been effected. She wishes too, to know what has been done to the Cistern, as your silence on the subject is not a good omen. And then she wants to hear something further with regard to the fodder, and the gathering in of the winter supplies. Aunt Mary's letter was very satisfactory, but we wish to hear again, and about everything and everybody, especially how Aunt Caroline and Cousin Fanny are getting on. Can't you persuade Aunt Caroline to give us some account of her trip, for we have heard nothing about it yet. While Grandma was at Mrs. Stevens' (she staid two days there) Miss Bear brought me my parcel, for which I am very much obliged to Aunt Caroline and must give her the credit of being a very satisfactory shopper. Mary wishes to hear something about her bonnet, whether Cousin Fanny brought her one ot is going to make one. The fall is advancing and she is getting anxious to know something about it. We were very glad to hear that Aunt Margaret was going to board with Mrs. Ross. I am very sure she will find it a pleasant place to stay at, they are such remarkably kind and amiable people. Tell Aunt Margaret she must certainly come this way as we all want to see Williette before she goes to the City. When you write tell us when she expects to leave you all to enter into the gaieties of a winter residence in Richmond. I reckon we shall have more to enliven us here than for a year or two past as every one will feel obliged to entertain the new Professor and his wife. Last Friday we called upon her, as they had arrived the day before. Hearing that she had been the belle of Louisville we felt some little apprehension lest she should be such a fine lady as not to be able to feel at all at home among us; but she seems to be very ready to make acquaintance and is easy in her manners without affectation, so that we were quite pleased with our first visit. They are staying at Mr. Rogers' until they get their house ready. Grandma wishes to know how Clarissa is getting on and indeed all about everything. She feels sorry that she could not return with Mr. Joe Stevens and Miss Lizzy Conrad, but her visit has not been long enough yet and she is not ready to go. She expected to go with Mr. Rodes the last of this month or the first of next, but would like to know whether she is wanted at home or not. She wants you to have the Celery filled up to put it in a fair way to grow. Aunt Maria is going to send for Mama and Grandma to-morrow to come out to see her, and I suppose they will stay a week or several days at least. The family unite in love with Grandma &amp; myself in love to all of you with kisses for the little ones. Your affectionate niece, Maria C. Broadus</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philadelphia Nov. 1, 1852 My dear Eliza, From your long silence I began to fear, until I received your letter of the 28th, that something was the matter. I expect a letter from one or the other of the family at least once a fortnight. As Maria has sent me the $5 advanced for her, I now include that amount in the inclosed check—being Dr. Harrison's proportion of the proceeds of two Chicago lots which have been again sold for the same price of $1400 as before. The first payment we receive, however, is reduced by our agent's charges for his commission which is 5 per cent, &amp; $7.50 paid for sewers &amp; a premium for a draft, which reduced the first payment to $198,52—one fourth of which is $49.63 to which I have added $5—making in all 54.63 the amount of my check inclosed. The subsequent payments will be more. They write me that they could sell more lots, but I think it better to wait awhile. We also were much surprized &amp; grieved to hear of B. Gwathmey's death. He seemed to be in perfect health when I saw him here last spring. I understand he has left to his family about $20,000 which may secure to them the substantial comforts of life. Your mother's health appears to be better since she has abstained from eating after dinner, &amp; takes exercise daily. She sends forty kisses to little Elise &amp; wishes she could be boxed up &amp; sent on by Adam's express. The Rogers's have not yet taken possession of their house in this street—as they have been made to wait for their furniture. The Dunglisons are well—but poor Patterson continues to decline in appearance, &amp; I presume both in body &amp; mind. The weather has been so mild here that for many days we have dispensed with fires. I am delighted to hear, on Maria's account, that Mr. Rives has decided to make the improvement to his house he has so long meditated. I shall send him an account of our improved Rams by which he will be able to carry his spring water to his home at a small expense. Our love to all. I am affectionately yours G. Tucker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg Va.Nov 12 Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Leesburg Nov 11th 1852 My dear Francis Your letter of the 1st is before me. It was received several days ago. I have given the subjects contained therein the best reflections. I am quite as much perplexed as to your future operations as you can be: but you are so much better able to determine what course it would be best for you in the business you wish to engage in, than I can be, your attention having been directed that way. And therefore, I feel disposed to let you decide. I remember when in your situation, about to commence the world, with a similar engagement on hand, I suffered great distress of mind. Mountains of difficulty arose on every hand. I imagined that I never could scale them; but I did what our engineers do now-a-days in similar cases—I bored throughor tunneled them. Your scheme for purohasing Alta Vista, and establishing a School there will require a very considerable outlay of ready money, for the purpose of stocking the farm with hands, horses, cattle, implements etc etc and for furnishing &amp; fitting up a boarding house and school, laying in a stock of provisions, hiring servants etcetra. I suppose 5000$ will be required at least for that purpose. This sum could be had, if the plan were feasible and promising, but without further &amp; more minute &amp; particular examination of the premises I could not consent to enter into this speculation. You can however continue to make inquiries about this and other places as you intimate you will do. I will now proceed to examine your objections to Loudoun or Lisbon. Here is an establishment already fitted for your purposes without any considerable outlay. If you should succeed in establishing a good school here, and Mr. Benton should want his house in a year or two or three hence, I should feel perfectly safe in putting up such buildings as might be necessary-in that neighborhood. If I purchase Greggs farm—there is on the end of it, next to Lisbon, a most beautiful and elevated site for such an establsihment. A store could be established there, also. The situation is high and healthy. There are four important county roads meeting at this place. It is within four miles of Middleburgh, and ten of the Manassas Gap Railroad. Your second objection, Summy thinks, resides only in the imagination. Loudon probably sends as many representatives to the University as any other County in the State. There are many families of wealth and influence in it, and others are coming even from Southeastern Va. Robert Bolling of Petersb.g has purchased an estate near Upperville for one of his boys. Bedford Brown, ex-senator from N.C. has located here himself near Salem. Then Fauquier County is close at hand which contains many of the first families of Virginia. etc etc etc. If the school fees are low living is cheaper and plainer. I have a dread of the South from their extravagant mode of living. Your third objection is to some extent answered above. How far the University, or a Graduate therefrom may be respected or appreciated in other counties in Va. over &amp; above Loudon, can but be quessed at or conjectured. I think while we have in the mass a people who do not sufficiently appreciate good education, there are a good many families who do, and who patronize fully, our institutions of learning— and to a good degree the University. I think you had better consider the matter cooly, and not to suffer it perplex your mind too much. Wait for the openings of a Good Providence. We are all subject to the control of a superintending Power. I have no doubt that you have a preference for Albemarle and the South—and I should like you to be gratified in your choice—if it can be done without risking too much upon an uncertain experiment. The case you mention alluding to a union with Dr. H. upon the happenings of certain contingencies, might possibly prove available. But I think it is too remote and uncertain to build on it a reliable hope. Summy has written thus far, I will now add that if upon reflection you think best to consumate that very important engagement under which you appear so restive, let there be no childish hesitation, act honorably, manly &amp; boldly. Your father will always take pleasure in sustaining you. I am proud of you &amp; your noble conduct, in winning so honorable a prize. I hope you will ever so act as to merit her best love &amp; esteem. Her name is mentioned by her acquaintances with praise. If you think that propriety demands a speedy union you have my free consent &amp; approbation. You could continue to board for the time being &amp; the necessity being stronger more effort would be made to establish you, &amp; in that case Dr. H. would probably feel freer to advise you in the selection of a place &amp; plan. I dont know that I can get to Albemarle a soon, however much I desire to gratify you, but let me again assure you that you may always rely upon my best &amp; kindest fatherly offices; for your comfort &amp; happiness. I hope this will suffice to cheer you. We cant expect to be fixed satisfactorily at short notice. We are not exclusive pets of fortune, we must hammer out by our industry, our reputation &amp; our future, &amp; although the race may not always be to the swift, the exceptions are few, &amp; fortune attends almost invariably the industrious &amp; frugal, who have moderate aspirations. Trust in God, &amp; be cheerful &amp; content. Look with confidence to Him for aid &amp; counsel. He will bless you in your honest efforts. Affectionately yr father D. G. Smith Write to Aunt H. who is gloomy &amp; desponding. Write cheeringly. Also to your Ma.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mary HarrisonHarrisonburg Virginia University. Nov 30th 1852 My dear Mother I thought when I left home I would have written before this. But really I have not found the time &amp; have been occupied one way and another. We came up here Friday found Sister very busy preparing for a dinner party that day. It was given to Mrs. Dr. Davis family &amp; some ladies who were visiting her. Caroline and myself did not appear at the dining table. We took our dinner in George's room. There has been a good many of the ladies too see us. Mrs. Rogers called Saturday and then Sunday after preaching Mr. Rogers and his lady called again &amp; gave us a very cordial invitation to come to see them soon and often. Jake came up here Sunday to church he had received a letter from William. He had been to Mrs. Ross to see if he could be suited in a room. She proposed to let him have a room in the yard, to reach which we would have to pass the Kitchen, and for this room she asked him $18 per week. She also had another dark room in the back part of the house, for which she asked $20 and then the servant was to sleep in the same room. He says of course he could not stand this. William says he finds it very difficult to get a room in a respectable boarding house at anything like reasonable price. He engaged a room at the Washington hotel at $17.50 a week. It is on the first floor and is large and convenient, he says the fare is very good and the house orderly and quiet. It appears to be so much to spend that I am almost sorry I left home. I can hardly say when I will leave for Richmond. I believe it is week after next. Jake will go down. William mentioned in his letter he supposed I would not come until he did. I think I will go down to Jakes to morrow and spedn a few days and then return if I can I will have to hire a hack to get to Charlottesville. I walked to town yesterday with Maria and it fatigued me so much I will not attempt it again. We went to the mantua makers she fitted the body of my dress. We had the pleasure of a visit from Mr. Gibson Mr. Clark &amp; Johnson yesterday evening they staid until after tea. Mr. Johnson appeared pleased to see us, said when I wrote home I must remember him to you and the family. I do not think Williette has been well since she has been here. her cold was increased. She has been so fretful, and I think her gums are hurting her a good deal. She is so much frightened at every strange face. With all I think she is growing sweeter every day. Lidda met with a severe burn on her hand this morning. She fell against the stove in the kitchen, poor little thing cried very much. Mama I do hope you will keep within doors and not expose yourself in the cold. Just think of your sufferings and what danger you are in. I do feel so anxious about you. I wrote a note by John Bear to Fannie. If she did not receive it I wish she would send me Willie coral necklace. We have not seen or heard from Mary looked for her yesterday and today but she did not come in consequence of the bad roads I imagine. Edward Syevens and Tommy Yancey came to see on Thursday the same evening we arrived. Edward was here yesterday evening for a few minutes. It is growing late and I must close by insisting upon some one writing. I know if the family knew I was writing they would send their love. Give my love to Mrs. Stevens and Lucie and all other friends who inquire for me. Caroline joins me in love to Mary Jane Fannie and yourself. I will write again soon. I remain ever your attached daughter Margaret F. Stevens</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia Dec 2d/52 My dear Ma A longer interval has, I think, elapsed since I last wrote home, than has occerred before this session. As the weeks fly past (and they go now very rapidly) I wonder that I have not written, and yet while they are passing it seems to me that I can hardly find time for writing, without neglecting some other duty. So, as a last attempt, I have commenced this morning just after breakfast, &amp; have a short hour in which to accomplish my purpose. I had intended writing to you soon after I left home, but it happen ed at the first of the session that I was anxiously considering what I should do in the future, &amp; all the time I had to write home, was devoted to this subject. As I sit now at my table, with the sun shining in at my window, I can easily transport myself in imagination back to Leesburg, and fancy that I am with you again, surrounded by all the old familiar faces. Only one place is vacant, that was not so when I left home. I wish sometimes it were as easy to change our place in reality as in imagination. I should be often with you. I hear but little from Summerfield or Howard. They have both written to me, it is true, and probably the reason why I dont hear more frequently, is that I have never answered their letters. I believe I have never written to Howard yet, and the first inch of time I can spare, must be given to him. I should like to know what they are doing, whether going to school, or keeping store. Summerfield's visit to the University last year did not I hope prove so little agreeable as to deter him from making another journey to Charlottesville. I hope to see him again in the summer. I have almost given out the idea of your ever getting as far as this place. I am afraid that your aversion to the Church South will never be so much overcome as to permit you to venture into her borders. The outskirts of her domain have given you such an idea of her character, that I am not surprized you do not feel much curiosity to venture into her interior. I think however you would not discover the difference between Methodists here and Methodists anywhere else, unless you knew beforehand. I do not think that the Methodist preachers whom I have seen here, are so able men as a great many in the Balto. Conf., but they seem to be trying to do good. I suppose you will have the good fortune of getting Mr. Rogers for another year. You ought to endeavor to retain him, for I am sure, from what I saw of him, he is much superior as a preacher, to any you have had since the division of the Church. I wish you could see our Chaplain, old Mr. Gibson, a veritable old apostolic Methodist minister, who tells and expounds to these Professors &amp; students, plain, old fashioned Methodist doctrine rather plainer truth than they have ordinarily listened to perhaps. I observed in the paper some time since, that Broad Run had been advertized. What has been the result? The neighborhood in which it is situated will no doubt be a hindrance to its ready sale. The advertisement, however, causes me to suppose that the idea of leaving Leesburg is under very serious consideration. I hope it will not end there. I took occasion to send my thanks to you indirectly for those nice shirts etc., which you were so kind as to send me by Edward. I now take the opportunity of thanking you personally. They have been very serviceable to me. The new shirts fitted me remarkably well. I like them better than any I have. Situated as we are here, without any one to look after our clothes, little presents of this kind are worth more than money, at the same time, that their worth and acceptability are increased by the spirit of kindness, which prompted the gift. I have had almost no time of late to think of the subject of most of my letters home this session, i. e. that of my future employment. My objections to Lisbon are not thought to be insuperable, as I learn from the last letter I received. Edward does not like the place, I believe. I hope this resource (Lisbon) will not be forfeited by the delay necessary to form a prudent decision. I still hope however that I may meet with other openings, &amp; so be permitted to choose from among several offers. My remarks about Alba V. were misunderstood. Since I heard Mr. Coleton's report I have given up all idea of it &amp; ceased to think about it &amp; that was intended to be the purport of what I said in the last letter. You at home must not forgot me in my trouble &amp; anxiety on this subject. You must help me as much as you can. I am sure I shall have the kindest wishes &amp; best advice of you all. Give my love to Pap, Aunt H. &amp; the boys. My respects to Mr. &amp; Mrs. Rogers Very affectionately F. H. Smith I send Summy some papers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harrisonburg Dec 18th 1852 My Dear Husband You may well imagine how much pleased I was at the reception of your letter on last evening. I was very anxious about you, fearing you would suffer intensely with the cold. It is said to be the severest weather, we have had for the last twelve years. The night you crossed the mountain reminded me very much of your departure to Texas. Mrs. Wheelright was kind enough to bring your latter with her to Church on Sabbath morning for me to read, which was quite a relieve to my mind, to hear you had gotten safely to Jakes without breaking down. I hoped when you wrote you would have determined upon your boarding house. I wish you may succeed in getting comfortable lodgeings and that your stay in Richmond may be very pleasant. I have felt exceedingly lonely since you left sometime hardly know what way to employ myself. However I have been sewing very hard through the day, and then would knit at night. Fannie has been with me all the time. Brother &amp; Sister Wheelright called to see me the evening after you left in fine spirits, and tried to cheer me by saying you would make plenty of money. I think it is poor comfort, what ever the object may be, to have to be separated from our near and dear friends particularly when you have so much to depress the body and spirits. I will endeavor to bear the separation with as much fortitude as I possibly can under existing circumstances. Brother Doggett preached for us last sunday a very good sermon. He is staying in town trying to nurse himself that he may be able to discharge his duties more efficiently on the circuit. I think it is well enough he is housed this severe weather. John came up quite elated this morning saying he had sold Mr. Doggett a Cloak and waistcoat. Mr. Wheelright went to Elk Run on saturday it was one of the most disagreeable days I have seen for a long time snowing and blowing all day. He returned on Monday. I have not seen him to speak to him. I do not know what he thinks of the purport of your letter. Mary received a letter from Sister Eliza saying they talked of getting a local preacher by the name of Gibson, but I suppose they told you all about it when you were there. Did you go to hear Dr. Doggett preach on last sunday. How does he compare with our brother Wheelright. The class met last sunday morning Harvey led. The morning was so inclement I did not attend. Mama received a letter from Rush last Saturday night. He is very anxious to get home but Mary is unwilling for him to leave her. Minnie still continues quite indisposed and he thinks they would be runing a great risk to bring her out this inclement weather. I fear it will be sometime before they can cross the mountain. Sam Sterling has lost his little boy it died in Woodstock on saturday. It remains were brought here Sunday and interred in the Cemetery. I suppose it will be of some interest to you to hear the Old Jail was sold last Saturday. The Odd Fellows &amp; Sons Temperance were the purchasers. I have forgotten what they gave for it. You will here from some one else of your correspondence more fully about it. Colds are very prevalent a great many persons have quite sick. Every member of Mama family have been almost laid up. She has been very ill herself, looks worse than I have seen her for a length of time. I hope the weather will moderate before very long. I have been some ailing with rheumatism my hand and arm was quite painful Sunday and yesterday, but I am happy to inform you it is some better to day. I am not able to say how they are getting on in the store. Very well I have no doubt. John is in fine spirits. Lawrence has been here every day very nusy writing. He came up yesterday to get your note on Cousin Edward Smith but could not find it. We have received a number of letters concerning the Cadets since you left. One of them came from Richmond from a man by the name of Steal. He sent one dollar note in it wishing you to send him the Red book and several cards. The amount of which he said would come to 75 cys and then he said he wanted the postage paid on them. Harvey attended to it but said he could not find the cards he wrote for, he sent some he said were new ones. John I think forwarded you two on business this morning. I believe I have written everything I can think of at present. You will I have no doubt be pleased to receive this scrawl if it is not very interesting, and give me much credit for my promptness in replying to your letter so soon. I wish as soon as you can find the time you would attend to the memorandum you took down for me, and send them by the first wagon. William when I think of your absence it seems to me I cannot submit to it. I hope when you write you will always give me the particulars concerning yourself. Do you wish the Herald forwarded to you let me know in your next letter. If you wish then sent I suppose only send those which come after your letter is received. I have been a good deal tried with Jane since you left. Almost tempted to send her home. Indeed I hardly know what to do about it. What do you think of John Effinger asking me to let Jane carry him wood for his room. I think it very strange when he has a man hired in the store he cannot get him to bring his wood up. If he furnishes a part of her clothing it will be well enough, but he will not do any such thing. I think he can do more than most of people. Give my respects to Mr. Gogerty who I presume you will see very often. Also to Mitchell and Sallie Conrad Lucie and Fannie are know sitting by the stove trying to keep themselves warm. Say they miss you very much send much love to you. Mr. Merchant will take tea here this evening. Your Mother as well as Mama and Mary Jane, Caroline join me in much love to you. I must close it is getting dark. John sends his respects and says you must write very soon. William I urge you to write often very often. I remain ever your attached Wife. Margaret Stevens Please direct me how to direct your letters. I fear you will not receive this M. F. Stevens (This letter should be dated 1851. E. D. G.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Washington Dec 15th 1852 Dear Aunt Ellen I recived yours of the 18th and was glad to hear that you were all well. I am sorry that we cannot come up to Leesburg at Chrismas. Papa thinks it will be too cold for us to come so far in the stage. You must come to Washington this Einter and see us because we may not stay here any longer than Spring. After we returned home in the fall Pap &amp; Mamma looked in the stores on the Avenue for a likeness of Mr. Clay but could only find one and that was injured and they would not have it. When they see a good one they will buy it and send it to you. I will keep a bright lookout for the Chrismas box, and shall be very much obliged for it. We are all well of our colds. We send our love to all. Please write to me soon. Your aff neice E. R. Hamilton (From Eliza Ridgely Hamilton to Mrs. D. G. Smith)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Mary Jane HarrisonHarrisonburg Va. University Dec 16th 1852 My dear Sister As I have been thinking a good deal about you all today I thought I would write, if only a short letter, and send it by Smith Irvine, he told me he was going over Friday. I hope to hear from you before that time. I don't feel satisfied unless I hear from you all once a week at least. Cant you or Fannie Gratify me. Margaret got off last Sunday with Mr. Stevens. She didn't like the idea of going on Sunday &amp; hesitated sometime before determining. She thought she might not meet with company for some days. I went down to the depot with her. I saw William for a few minutes but didn't get any news from him. Williotto didn't know him. She wouldn't allow the gentleman to have anything to say to her. She was disposed to make friends with Bro. &amp; some of the boys before she left here. She was very much taken with her little Cousin Edgar. She would kiss him very oftne, and would rock his crib and sing bye to him. I miss her &amp; M. very much. I feel quite anxious to hear from them but will not until Jake returns. Friday or Saturday. Margaret was suffering with a pain in her stomach when she left. As Sallie was so lonely &amp; seemed anxious I stayed with her until Tuesday. She wanted me to stay all the week but I had been away a week &amp; thought I had better return. W wouldn't care much now to slip down to Sallio's for Sister is preparing for a Party. It is to come off Friday night. They have not said anything to me, but I expect they will want me to go in, and I do not feel like going at all. I wont enjoy it I know. I expect it will be a large party, as the weather has been so pretty for several days. Sister thought perhaps Mary might come in, and as it would not be very pleasant to her to be here at such a time, she asked me to write to her to defer her visit until after Christmas, but could not as the mail does not go out there before Saturday. I looked a little for them to send for me this week as the roads have dried up some. I would rather spend my Christmas here, but will have to go at their convenience. Have you heard from Mary yet. I was in hopes she would write to me last week, but didn't. Please don't say anything about what I have written when you write. They may not like it. They are talking a great deal about Christmas here, and busy making &amp; buying presents. Bro. Sister Maria &amp; Mary have been to town every day this week looking for Christmas gifts. Lida will be well supplied as every one wan s something for her. Sister &amp; Mary have made her very pretty yellow &amp; pink Mousiline dresses. I went to hear Mr. Clark preach Sunday night. I liked him only tolerably. They had two mourners. One of them professed religion. I would like to hear how the meetin resulted in H-burg. What will you do for preaching if Bro. Cross leaves. Will he engage Mr. Soule services. How did you get along with the Stoves during the meeting. As I did not finish my letter last night I hardly know whether to finish it this morning or not unless I send it by mail, for it has been sleeting, snowing and now it is raining. I'm sorry for I wanted to go to town this evening. Maria &amp; Mary are invited to Mr. Timberlakes this evening to a musical soiree. Mr. D'alphonse offered to bring a Hack for them. They talk of going disagreeable as it is. Tell Fannie that Miss Virginia &amp; Lucy Paine called to see me last week. They inquired for her &amp; sent their love to her. I have seen very little of Fannie Conrad. She was in the country at Mr. Dunkun's whilst we were at Jakes. I don't think H. Bear visits much. Has Fannie any idea of going to Mt. Jackson to spedn her Christmas, or is she too busy yet. What is Lucy about these times. Tell her I heard Ed say the other day, that he wouldn't care if they would think of him before Christmas. Give my love to Lizzie &amp; Clem Conrad. Tell them I still hope to hear from them &amp; Lucy too. My love to Mrs. Stevens &amp; the Boys. Aunt B. &amp; Cousin M. Mrs. Penco &amp; all my friends. Will you all get a bid across the way, or will they be very quiet about it. Have you learned yet who Mary's intended is. I have written more than I expected. I will stop for the present, insisting upon you writing soon. Love to Ma Fannie &amp; yourself. Remember me to Clarissa Bob Tom &amp; Emma. All are in their usual health here. from your attached Sister Carrie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Va. Dec 28th 1852 My dear Father Edward has just stepped into my room with a letter from you from which it appears there has been a mutual misapprehension as to the party from whom a letter was due, I supposing that my last letter containing allusions to several important matters, had not been answered as yet. However I must confess that this supposition has not mainly been the reason for my delay. I had fully intended writing a reply to your acceptable letter, and it has certainly not been owing to anything said therein, that my intention has not been sooner carried into effect. It must be attributed to a bad habit I have, of deferring the performance of that which I feel no immediate pressing necessity of executing. It seems to me to be one of the worst features tho' perhaps an inevitable one, of our school systems, that stated duties are required at stated times &amp; the pressure of compulsory regulations is substituted for the stimulus of rational motives. To this mode of viewing duty I attribute the difficulty we all feel in applying ourselves in times of vacation. The amount of useful acquirement I have made in all my "vacations" summed up, would not equal what is attained by one week's diligent application. This habit attaches insensibly to other duties, as I have frequently felt to my great mortification; &amp; in none more frequently than in my correspondence. I was very much gratified by the kind words contained in your letter. Nothing I have is prized more highly than the collection of letters I have rec.d at various times from you. I have not had any special occasion during the past month or two for thinking of plans for a settlement. My life runs on here so evenly from one day to another, that the weeks pass by almost ere I am aware they have flown. This undisturbed quiet life is one that I would continue to lead, were my own wishes alone to be consulted. No circumstances have occurred to develop anything new as to the future, or to call my attention particularly to arrangements for the coming year. I am afraid that the session will have passed before I shall be able to make any definite desirable step. Time in its rapid flight seems to hurry on the moment when something must be fixed upon, while at the same time it brings with it nothing to aid in making the decision. It would be agreeable to me, if I were sure it wd be right, to dismiss all thoughts of the future, enjoy the present as it passes-and trust, like Mr. Mioawber, to what may "turn up". But this will not do. My misfortune is that I do not know what will. I have thought of asking you to notice in your Intelligencer any advertisements offering places for teachers—such as you wd judge desirable. Such advertisements are I have frequently observed in that paper. In regard to Lisbon I will say that I do not wish to lose the chance of getting it, altho I confess that from the time I first heard of and saw the place, I have never had much opinion of it. It has acquired a reputation, which whether good or bad, will probably stick to it. This should be carefully considered. The reputation wh. Benton et alii, have given it, is not probably of the best kind. As to the cost of living in the same style in Loudoun &amp; in Southern Virginia, I am hardly prepared to decide, but I assure you, from what I have heard &amp; seen of the schools about here-it is not more the practice or interest of teachers here to give luxurious fare, than anywhere else. The great inducement to go to Lisbon would be in my opinion the nearness to you, that is if you should buy the farm mentioned, of which your letter intimates some doubt. All that I can say now is that I want to abide by your judgement, aided by any circumstances which may transpire here or elsewhere, of which I may be able to inform you. I trust that if I work faithfully along, I may yet enjoy the kind direction of that Providence, which has so signally blessed me heretofore, utterly unworthy as I have been. I am glad to learn that you are all well. I hope you have had a merry Christmas. It would have been pleasant to me to have stepped over &amp; taken my Christmas dinner with you. As it was I resolved to spend the day here-having spent now 4 successive Chr. days at the University. I was invited to spend the day at Dr. Harrison's, where I found several of the Professors and their ladies. There was a fine Christmas tree, a pine covered with festoons, presents etc. in the parlor. A great dinner at 4 o'clock constituted an important feature of the occasion. Edward spent his Christmas, as he will no doubt inform you, with a friend of his in Richmond. I advised him to go, as it wd. be a relaxation to him &amp; I knew his friend to be a very pious &amp; steady young man. I should not have been willing for him to go otherwise, as many students go there to frolic &amp; carouse. My health till within the past few days has been very good, &amp; my only affliction now is an inflammation of an eyelid, wh. has been painful &amp; disfiguring, causing me to go about with a pair of blue specs perched on my nose. Tell Powell H's father, that from inquiries I have made of his son's professors &amp; from his general correct &amp; studious habits so far as I know them, Powell deserves to be highly commended. I am afraid that he suffers his studies to abserb him too much. Powell looks as if he enjoyed good health. Aunt H. has, I presume. taken up her abode at Uncle Sandy's I wish my love given to her and all at their house. I shall write to her. I send herewith $200, part of the 1st instalment of my salary, which I wish you keep in the same way as the other $300. My love to all—great &amp; small. A happy &amp; prosperous New Year to you all. Yr. affec. son Fr. H. Smith Did Summerfield get his "Travels"? You observe my name blotted on the check. The cash.r wrote by mistake "two hundred" there at first.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University December 29th 1852 Dear Ma The old year is waning away and I have not written yet to you and so I shall dedicate to you this letter which is partly in acknowledgement of the reception of Pap's letter of the 23rd inst. with the enclosed money. The prime idea in one's head at this time of the year is Christmas of course. Perhaps you would like to know how I have spent my Christmas. Well, strange to say, in a capital way. Last Christmas I worked all day while now I have not worked for several. On Friday last I went to Richmond with a student named Thomas (the son of one of the wealthiest citizens of Richmond) who invited another student and myself to go and spend the Christmas with him. We returned on yesterday—having spent a most agreeable time. I did not see our honorable representative C. B. Ball-having all my time taken up in seeing more attractive persons. Mr. Thomas is engaged in the tobacco business and has grown rich—has built himself a very fine, large house on Shookoe hill, Richm.d, which I went through—it not being finished yet. It made me think of the "Baronial Hall" which Pap occasionally pictures to himself, but of which he will enjoy but little unless he get away from Leesburg faster. He has worked long enough now— to be enjoying to a greater extent the fruits of his labors. Mr. Thomas has risen pretty much by his own exertions and is enjoying the reward—why should not every one who deserves it do the same? Beside all this there is another consideration of some weight with me and that is if ever I should wish to invite any follow student to my home or if any one should drop in—in his travelling, I could be without the fear of his being bored to death in that beautiful burg and could have some hope of his being pleasantly entertained in the country. As to the location of a country-seat—it strikes that somewhere in these regions would be the place. I think the people here are kinder and understand more of the philosophy of life than a great many in Loudoun, and altho' some parts of Loudoun would seem desirable still the whole country appears to me &amp; perhaps does partake of of the peculiar meanness of Leesburg. This may all be quite a wild fancy. Be it so—it can go for what it is worth. I only hope that Pap will take into more serious and active consideration the subject of getting away from that miserable old town of ours. Well— that's enough for that. I haven't been able yet to get to study exactly as before the trip to R. perhaps for thinking of the pleasant time I had &amp; of a very pret———well-nothing in particular. Francis at present is troubled somewhat with a swelling on the under lid of his right eye. It is nothing serious &amp; is getting better. I showed him the letter last received in which Pap said he thought he had forgotten home. He said he had written a short time since to some one at home. I expect he wrote again directly. He said he thought he would. You will excuse me if I put in this letter a statement of my coming expenses and what money I shall want. Statement. Cash on hand $13 In Francis's hands $26 (I got 9$ from before I went to Richmond) 39 Owe for board &amp; room rent (to be p.d in two payments $80 washing 10 Fuel (hereafter about) 10 Light 5 Owe on clothes (I got an overcoat for 13$-a good one 12 Other expenses say 15 Travelling 20 152 Off cr. 39 113 This is all I can think of now and so I think that without doubt 110 or 120$ more would amply suffice me. I would like to hear in the next letter from home how much money I have already spent this session. It will be seen that with a little help I can meet the first payment remaining on board—which falls due about the 1st of January '53—and 10$ in the next letter and 10$ in the following would enable me to pay the board and what I owe on clothes. Ten dollar bills are quite a relief to one when his purse is growing thin. Love to all at home. Hoping to receive an early answer. I remain yrs affectionately E. B. Smith I will answer Pap's queries etc. more particularly in another letter.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University Jan 2 1853 Dear Brother If I was disposed to fly off into long sentences and words a foot and a half long, as Horace has it (vid. Ars Poet. line 97) I would probably, after your fashion, go into ecstacies on the commencement of a new year—on turning over new leaves in the book of life, and such novelties; but being content to plod on in the old way, I shall try to write you a plain and brief epistle. Yours of Christmas eve was duly received and as business should be attended to first I will merely state that I have received four letters containing X's—the first dated Nov.r 2—the 2nd Nov. 26—the 3rd Dec 10—the 4th Dec.r 23—the last being the one to which you refer in your letter. So it seems that all have come safely to hand. I would simply mention here what I believe I mentioned in that arithmetical letter to Ma that the 2nd paym.t for board is about due and that if a couple of X's more are convenient I will once more be solvent. I also request again a statement of my expenses up to the present. In the letter above referred to I think that I stated some thing about my trip to Richmond and therefore nothing more need be said perhaps but that I think (more than I thought before I went down) that route home to be decidedly the most pleasant and shall probably take it: but there's time enough for that yet. In your party-experiences you should recollect that frocks are not exactly a la mode. You say something of Howard's being made acquainted with my poetic message. As my memory is rather treacherous I beg that you will explain in your next for I do not understand the allusion. Your reminiscences are very vivid in reference to Christmas and among your vagaries in connection therewith you have struck on a moderately good sentiment about `rolling years'— `memory'—`birghter wreaths' etc. which no doubt you recollect. You seem to be getting on famously in Latin—my advice is not to weary—but press on—the prize is on ahead way up the rough sides of what is called the hill of Fame—and you can only reach it by keeping a stiff upper lip, and `unterrified' heart (be a genuine Democrat in that), and `going it boots'. 'Tis well said that "faint heart ne'er won fair lady" which will apply to other cases then that for which it was intended. Papa did not mention aunt Ann Maria's death but I received a few days since a letter from cousin Henrietta Lugenbeck which contained the sad news. Death is never weary. I would like to hear the particulars, in your answer to this. Papa, in his last letter, refers to some queries which he made in his letter before that. I have looked at that letter and found no questions except in reference to some farm in this vicinity. I have heard of none, but will keep a look out. If there are any other questions-please let me know. Speaking of farms I am as anxious as ever, indeed perhaps more so, that he would get one and locate himself. The advantages of such a course have been often stated and I think it should be done as soon as possible. Time is slipping on and that not slowly and while we are thinking and speaking of it days grow to months and months to years and no progress is made and things are as they were. As to Lisbon I know but little and can therefore say but little and that has been said already. My preferences to a situation farther south ought deservedly to have but little influence in the decision yet as they can do no harm I have stated them and see no reason yet to change my opinions. If you intend to take a course at the University I think you will be influenced by the same motives as myself—viz. to be at a more convenient distance from this, and by other considerations which I have mentioned before. I hope that you do intend to study here. A good and thorough education is a `magnum bonum' and you should get it at any risk but that of health etc. Nature, thank Heaven, has given all four of us improvable minds and Providence has given opportunities to improve them and I see no reason that we should be left entirely behind in the great battle of life. There is room enough for us and many more and that high up and the best motto in the world is "Onward and upward" as far as possible. Though you are getting to be so well read in Latin I beg leave to correct a slight error into which you have fallen `Et cetera' means `and other things' and the expression you used in your letter in connection with those soirees which you attended about your laying yourself out on the "cakes and other et ceteras" is perfectly murderous. The Christmas Box will remain I suppose a non-entity. The trouble of getting one up and of getting it safely here would scarcely be repaid by the pleasure it would give (though it w.d be great)—now that Christmas is gone. I will be happy to call for all that would have been sent—next summer—(do you think, by way of parenthesis, that you will be on a farm then?) Give my love to all. And hoping for a speedy answer I remain As ever yours affectionately Edw. B. Smith Francis and myself are enjoying good health at present. (Letter to his brother, Summerfield Smith)</field>

SmithUniversity of Virginia Leesburg Jan 3d 1853 My dear son Francis In order to avail myself of this mornings mail, &amp; having 3 letters to write I must make this short. Yours of 29th rec.d It is short &amp; badly written. You are becoming careless. Your scrip is not near so well written as formerly. Dont get into that bad habit. You were mistaken about our correspondence. The last letter I got from before this was dated 1st Nov. in answer to which I wrote soon thereafter say a week after. So that you see that you have been very remiss. Yr. Ma rec.d one since. Did you receive that letter of mine early in Nov.? I am curious to know. I have not much to write now. Enclosed is my note for the 200$ dft you sent. I am pleased to find you so provident &amp; that you are husbanding your means. Save all you can. Enclosed you will also find 5$ which is intended as a Christmas present from yr. Ma in lieu of the usual box which was not sent this time. I wrote also to E.d by this mail &amp; enclose to him one of the same sort, also a Bank dft for 40$ to aid in his expenses. About other matters &amp; things more interesting I will write again when you acknowledge this which do soon. We are all well, except probably the boys who have been indulging too freely in good things &amp; are now a little puny, but a few days penitence will make all right. Our love to you &amp; E.d Yr.

      <field name="fulltext">Miss Mary Jane HarrisonMarrisonburg Virginia Midway January 7th 1853 My dear Sister Mary, I have thought every week since we left you that I would write to you. Mother I know would be anxiously looking for some tidings from us and I felt it was my duty to write to relieve her of all anxious feelings about us—and did my utmost to make this rouse me to the discharge of my duty; but all was in vain. Week after week fled by, without my being able even to attempt it. In addition to my sorrows, I have been a good deal indisposed the greater portion of the time I have been here and really have not been able to write several weeks. I still go bow'd down in spirits and sometimes sink almost into despair. Sorrow and desolation pervade my heart. Would that I could suppress my feelings, but 'tis impossible. This goes home, but not to my husband to cheer and comfort him. Oh! that dark, still grave that holds and keeps him forever from my sight. Oh! that monster, grim monster, death that has snatched him from my fond embrace and made me a mourning, sorrowing widow. How hard it is for me to bear it. How hard to believe that the fond father and devoted husband with us last New Year is gone-gone, gone into Eternity—that we shall never again see his face on earth, that alone we must live and struggle through life's troubles and cares, while he slceps 'neath the clods of the valley But I must not indulge in writing my feelings. But oh I am so lonely and desolate what else can I write of, save the deep feelings of my heart: I know you thought of his birthday, how sacred to our memory! Dearly loved one, tho' sleeping the sleep of death thy memory is and over will be cherished by us. Oh that thou couldst have lived for thy dear children to have leved and remembered thee! Oh! that they could have known how tenderly their father loved! My mind has been greatly exercised about how I shall live. I have thought of a great many ways, but as yet have not determined what I shall do, and will not till I see Brother. I feel like he will know what I had best do better than any one else. Oh I cant tell you how I feel when I feel that in truth I am a poor widow and must make some exertion for me and my dear children to live. Oh! what is there that I would not give for my dear, my fondly lov'd husband. Father why didst thou tear him from me, and leave me thus in this wilderness world? Oh why do I have to suffer thus? I must stop. Oh! forgive me if I have said amiss. The dear little children are well. Minnie often says she is going over the mountain to see her grandma and carry her little sister with, that she cant leave her at all. She is getting to be very interesting, and talks a great deal. Lucy is a sweet babe I think but is not near as pretty as I expected to see her. She is perfectly devoted to Charlotte, and 'tis very seldom that she will stay with any one else when Charlotte is about. I keep her at night with Columbia's help, but as soon as morning comes she is restless until carried to see her brandma. I wish the children could be with you all, a while at least, but the roads are so bad now that I dont know when we will be able to get over. Carrie came up last tuesday, and seems as well as usual. I think she is beginning to think about getting home again. I have not heard her say when she xpects to go. She is writing to Fannie now and I presume will tell her plans to her if she has made any. I stmpathize deeply with auntBaxter in her late bereavement Truly she has her share of sorrows and afflictions in this world. May God support her and sanctify to her, her great affliction is my prayer. There has been but little sickness in this neighborhood since we've been here. Mrs. Jarman's the only death. No doubt you have heard of this lamentable event. Mr. Jarman and Sarah are said to be most deeply afflicted. Bettie is in bad health, confined pretty much to her bed-has been here for several weeks. Dr. Bibb her physician, is beginning to think very seriously of her case. Her disease he says is an inflamation of the kidneys, and he fears will terminate in the Dropsy. She has seemed better the last few days and I hope will continue to improve. Her boy is well and growing finely. Pa brought me a letter from you a short while ago. I am sorry to hear that Mother is much indisposed and hope she may speedily recover. Minnie is gone to bed, but before she laid down, told me to send her Grandma &amp; aunts a kiss and tell her grandma that she is a good girl, and if her aunt Carrie goes home before her ma she is going with her to stay with her grandma while she is sick. And aunt Fannie she sends two extra kisses for the nice bonnet she sent hor. We've not seen it yet, but I know 'tis pretty from the discription Carrie gave us of it. I am much oblige to her for her kindness in making it. I find it impossible for me to work. I have not made my winter dress yet. Pa gave me materials for a cloak too which is yet unmade. I don't see the use of my having clothes. I shall have to get to work soon tho' for the children. I am glad to hear that Mr. Cross is liked so much in Harrisonburg, and that Lucy &amp; Ginnie have become members of his church I hope to hear him before long. Cousin Julia I hope will receive more comfort ere long, but there's not much more comfort in this world for us. Oh that we may profit by our afflictions. Give much love to Mother for me, &amp; tell her I often think of her in her lonely state. God has done it and we must submit. Remember me affectionately to aunt Baxter, Mrs. Stevens, Lucy—and all enquiring friends. The family unite with me in sending love to you, Mother and Fannie. Good bye. Write soon. Yours affectionately Mary F. Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Richmond January 15th 1853 My dear Sister Having written so recently I think it hardly necessary to write so soon again if I was not aware of your great anxiety to hear from us and more particularly when anything is the matter. I am happy to say my dear little Williette is much better than when I wrote to Fannie. Although she has not recovered her former appearance. She is very sprightly and has a good appetite I think she will have two teeth through in a few days. Tencia says she can see two lower teeth just coming through the gum. She will not let me examine without making her cry. I dreamed last night she had four teeth I only wish it were a reality. I am so anxious about the dear little creature teething. The Dr. says I must not keep her long at one place. he is of the opinion that change of air and climate will prove more beneficial to her then anything I can do. He also says whenever the weather becomes settled I must bathe in cold water with some salt thrown in. I have been bathing her in the same kind of bath I used at home. WhenWhen ever the weather admits of it I have her carried out we have had some very pleasant days I wish it had continued to be mild. Williette gained her strength considerably while she was kept in the open air. I am almost ashamed for her to walk with the bonnet she has it is so much soiled. I wanted to buy a fur flat but her Papa thought $5 too much to give. I do not know what to do about it when I go to the University. I said something to Fannie about making some kind of a little bonnet and sending it to Charlottesville and the Cloak. You will be somewhat surprised when you find this letter is from Richmond and that we have not left. The day was so unfavorable the day I fixed to leave that I was afraid to turn out with Williette and I was suffering with a very bad cold indeed I think I never suffered more with a cold I believe my head gathered it is much better. Tell Fannie all Williette stockings are too short. I had to buy others. I am sorry I got so many they shrunk so much. I find it one of the hardest things to get a pair of shoes for Williette succeeded yesterday bought two pair gave $1 and a quarter for them. I wish you all could see her she is one of the sweetest and smartest little things. I think she understands everything you say. She tries to talk very much said buy buy papa very distinctly and a great many words she says. It is really amusing to see her pointing at the pictures in the book and trying to read. You will think this too smart and that her Mama imagines a good many things but more than myself notice her smartness. It pleases her papa exceedingly for her to say pretty papa, he tries to make her say ugly mama but I reckon it is to hard a word to pronounce. I sat at the wondow this morning looking at the funeral procession of Judge Cabell it was very large. The sermon was preached in St. Pauls church which is directly opposite from the house I am boarding. You will think I have very little curiosity about me when I tell you I have not been within the walls of the Capitol the weather has been so disagreeable that I have had no inclination to go. William came this morning for me but it is such a damp unpleasant day that I did not go. When I return to Richmond that is if I do I can go then. William wants me to return in a week or so and go to Norfolk and spend awhile. I feel more like going home but I reckon if I do I will have to return and go by the way</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harrisonburg Va.Jan 19 Miss Caroline E. HarrisonUniversity of Virginia Smithland January 17, 1853 My Dear Caroline I am now in the country staying this week with Cousin Julia, she came in on Sunday and nothing would do, but that I must come home with her. Rue had gone home to be at John Houston's marriage which is to take place this week, he is going to marry Miss Huffman. They seem very much pleased with the match. We were very glad indeed to hear from Mary &amp; yourself last week. it was quite a treat I do assure you. We all were very anxious to hear from Mary and the Children. How I want to see them. I do wish the roads would get better so they could come over the Mountains to see us. We are so lonely. Be sure and bring Minnie when you come if Mary dont come with you, which I hope she will consent too, I want to see the Dear little creature so much and hear her prattle. Your Ma was very complaining last week. Friday night she took a Blue pill and on Saturday a dose of castor oil between the two she was made very sick-had to lie in bed part of the day. When I came out here on Yesterday she seemed much better. her Cough has been very troublesome. I do wish she could get something to stop her coughing so much. it is distressing to hear her. The rest of us are in our usual health. I was sorry to hear that you had not been very well, take good care of your little self while you are away. I am getting very anxious to know when you are coming home, I think you have been away almost long enough for one time. Your Friends inquire very often about you. They want to know when we look for you back. Your Class told me to write to you that they wanted to see you very much. I do wish that you was here to take charge of them. They dont learn their lessons but very little if any. I told them on Yesterday if they didnt do better I would not give them a single ticket. They think that I am too hard with them. Fannie Yancy was not there she has a very bad cold cant speak above a whisper. a great many persons are complaining of colds. D. P. H. has a dreadful cold. Aint you sorry for him. I am sorry to tell you that Malinda was a great deal worse last week but still Quin thinks she will get well. Poor thing it does seem to me that her time on Earth is but short. She said to me the other day that indeed she was afflicted, but that the Lord afflicted with one Hand and blessed with the other. she told me that she had been unusually Happy all that day. What a comfort to know that she is willing &amp; ready to go when it is the Lords will to call her from time to Eternity. She sent for me Saturday evening to come &amp; bring some one with me to sing for her. Lucie &amp; I went after we were there some time Mr &amp; Mrs Logan Joe &amp; Jake Grove came in, we sung and Mr Logan prayed with her, she seemed very Happy. Poor Quin like to Broke his heart crying, I feel very much for him, it will almost kill him to loose Lin, but who of us that has not lost our Dearest Friends on Earth. We ought to make every exertion to meet them, where parting will be no more. It is the prayer of my Heart that I may be more faithful in days to come. We are all waiting anxiously for Bro Cross's return he promised to write but not a word have we heard since he left. I have wished often for his return, then we would not feel so lonely. I wish he would bring Clem back with him, but that he will not do. There is only eight our class away at this time. Dont you feel sorry for us that are left. I do. Mr Robert Jones has been back again to our Class, I would not be surprised if he would join our Church. I heard that he was mad with some of his church. Well did you see or hear anything of Laurence on his way to Richmond. I told him to call to see you but he said that he would not have time, it was very well he did not as you was at Mr Rives. he was very sorry to leave, but it was to his interest to go. I miss him ever so much, but however I will get along some way or other without him. I wrote to Margaret by him but have not heard from her since. I wish she would send Willie then she may stay as long as she pleases. I am right sick to see my little Willie. I wish I had some way to go over the Mountains while you are there. I want to see everybody. tell Sallie that I am coming the first chance to see the Baby. Cousin Julia joins with me in love to Cousin Gessner Cousin Eliza Maria Mary Mr. Broadus Sallie Mr Stevens Mag Bear &amp; yourself. Kiss Lidda for me and Mary &amp; the children if there. You must excuse all mistakes &amp; bad writing. it is so cold I have to keep turning round to get warm. Write soon. I am always glad to hear from you. Susan Bowman had her Baby on Monday night and it died Teusday night without any one's knowing it. Love to all. From your cousin Fannie M. Stuart</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mary HarrisonHarrisonburg Virginia Charlottesville January 21st 1853 My dear Mother I am now very comfortably situated at Jacob's. I thought as I had gotten my dear babe asleep, and Tencia was ironing I would try to write a few lines to inform you of my whereabouts and when we got to this place. We left Richmond Tuesday morning at six oclock arrived here at 12 oclock. I had much more pleasant trip than I anticipated I was fearful it would be too cold for Williette, she had taken cold as I suppose from the change in the weather. I dont think her cold was any worse from travelling. She coughs hard but it does not appear to make her sick. I am thankful to write you that she is relieved of the attack she had with her stomach and bowels. Poor little dear was very sick for a week, although the Dr. told me he apprehended no danger in the case I could not help feeling miserable. How often I wished I was at home with my Mama and Sister and then I thought of Fannie kindness to me. I wish so much I had her at home that she might be an amusement for you in your loneliness. She is growing more and more interesting every day knows everything you say to her. When any one leaves the room she holds out her little hand and says buy buy. She certainly is as I think one of the smartest and sweetest children living. You may tell Fannie she need not have the trouble of making her a bonnet. Her Papa bought her a beautiful fur hat the day before she left the City. I would be glad if there is an opportunity of sending her pink Cloak. Some one of the girls would send it. You will think this does not look much like coming home. It is very uncertain when I will get there, the roads are in such a condition that I would be afraid to travel with Williette however anxious I am to get home, I feel sometimes I must go any how. William wishes me to remain with my friends here until the latter part of the session, and then return to the City and go to Norfolk and spend a week and then go home by Washington. I was at the University yesterday morning. Caroline came down the day before as well as Sister Eliza brother and Maria. Sally Caroline and myself walked up. Sallie could not spend the day from her boy, we sat about an hour. The day was so delightful I sent Williette up in the evening. I was sorry to find brother suffering with his shoulder an back from a twist he gave it from lifting Bob over his shoulder. The rest of the family were well. Mary and Minna are both looking quite well. Mary I thought seemed to be more cheerful. I do not know when she will go to her Farthers but I have some idea if the weather is pleasant to go home with her. Dr. Johnson advised me to carry Williette about a great deal whenever it was pleasant. I dont know when I will go to the University to stay they have there house nearly full now and the table already filled. I am afraid too brother will not be pleased at my remaining here. I was truly troubled to learn from Mary Jane letter you had been so much complaining and prostrated from Medicine. I hope before this letter reaches you will be better, better in body and spirits. The chief reason I want to be at home for is that I might be with you. Mary necessarily has to be out of the room so much, and then Fannie has her engagements she cannot be with you much. I think Williette and myself could go to see you every day. I was sorry to hear Malinda Nicholas was sinking so rapidly. I feared when I left home she would not live through the winter. When do you expect brother Cross home. I suppose it is most time for his return. Caroline received a letter from Fannie yesterday she wrote from Cousin Julia. I am always so glad to hear from home. You have heard I reckon that Joseph Stevens had taken up his residence in Charlottesville he is boarding at Jakes, he has been quite unwell the last day or two was not confined to his room or bed, he is better today. Edward Stevens and Tommy Yancy came to see me last night. Edwards health has improved although I think he looks very badly. Sallie will have quite a large family. Adeline Rodes is coming to school in Charlottesville she will board here. Smith Irvine is boarding here also. Sallie and her babe are very well. I never saw anything grow like Edgar he is almost as big as my little creature. Williette has wakened and raised straight up in the bed I will be obliged to stop for the present. I am very much dissapointed Caroline did not come down to day. She was engaged about something probably helping Mary with her Cloak. Williette I think has improved since I have been here. Her aunt Sallie says she looks much better. Give my love to Mrs. Stevens and Lucie. Also to aunt Baxter and Martha Rice. Cousin Julia Smith and all other friends who inquire for me. I wish very much I could peep in at you all to night. Sallie wishes me to give her love to yourself Mary Jane and Fannie. Williette join with her Mama in sending her love to her Grandmama Aunt Mary and Cousin Fannie. Caroline said if I wrote I must give her love to you all. She has fattened up I think since she has been over the mountains. How does Clarissa and her baby come on. I shall look for a letter from some one from home before long. I am always anxious to hear. I hope you will be some little interested in this badly written letter. I am your ever attached daughter Margaret F. Stevens</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Washington Feb 2 1853 Dear Bro. Smith Although I wrote last, I was obliged to close very abruptly, because some Ladies came into our room just at the time. We expected to hear from you this morning, but were disappointed. In regard to Dave I wrote something, I know not what. But the foot is that I have indulged Eliza's wishes altogether in regard to him. Her views and mine are entirely at variance. She desires to set him free, and will not consent for him to be sold only for a term of yrs. And as you and she cannot agree in the terms I did not know any thing better than to take him off your hands when his year is up, the first of April. I hope you will not have much trouble with him. We have never told him he was to be free. We sent by the stage a can of the best oysters that could be procured in Washington City D. C. I went and ordered them myself by a specimen showed me, and they were to be soddered &amp; sealed up clean &amp; nice. We hope you got them safe. We paid the freight on them and all, and should have been pleased to have accompanied them and been at your qr.tly meeting, but this we could not do. Did Ellen receive Harpers Mag. for Jan'y? We sent it by mail. And now we've sent the frame by Mr. Orrison. Did all come safe to hand? We should like to know always of the safe arrival of any thing we send. The frame cost two dollars and fifty cents, which is fifty cents over the two dollars exchanged notes. You wrote me that you had received the rent from Cline &amp; Orr. You can pay the tares, and if there is any left send it down. I am going up to Balt. tomorrow morning to see Dr. Davis who is sick with Rheumatism and shall return in the evening. We have all had bad colds, but by the blessing of Divine providence we are all well at present. We constantly feel the importance of trying to live prepared for the time of adversity, and truly we are most unfaithful considering the priceless privileges we enjoy. If we were more faithful in the improvement of our advantages we should be much more useful and much more happy. After all, what can we do to add to the advancement of Our Redeemers cause in the earth? If we are so unspeakably happy as to be saved at last will it not be through the unmerited mercy of Our Saviour and Redeemer? Surely all our hopes are vain unless they rest upon Him as our all and in all. And therefore we may not, we need not fear, but trust our all to Him who is our Wisdom &amp; righteousness &amp; sanctification and redemption—all in all to fallen and helpless creatures such as we are. May He lead us safely all our journey through, and bring us safely at last to the Land of better promise. Most aff. M. G. Hamilton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg Va.Feb 11 Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Leesburg Feb.y 11th 1853 My dear son Francis What has become of your interest for your old home, your Father, Brothers etc etc? Was I gifted with a spirit of prophecy when I stated in anticipation this state of things as likely to result from your attachment to a certain most bewitching personage? or did your affection depend only upon that legal subordination due to your father untill you were 21? You will begin to think with me, if you have not already found it out, that man is a selfish being, we have, we say, to take care of ourselves. Man generally flatters himself that his devotion, constant &amp; persevering to the lawful business of life, is justified by the word of God, but when the motive is properly dissected &amp; scrutinized, there will be found mixed up with it a large share of covetousness &amp; unsanctified desire. There is great room for improvement in our modes of thinking upon these subjects. The mental &amp; spiritual enjoyments of man are circumscribed or neglected by the everlasting effort to cater to the demands of the physical—cormorantlike man. With these suggestions I pass on, &amp; assure you that the infrequency of your epistles to us has been the cause of some unpleasant feelings &amp; surmises. Will you not amend your ways. Try &amp; do so &amp; I will promise to draw the pen of oblivion over your past errors in this respect. You have been repeatedly assured of the great pleasure it affords us to receive your letters often. I do not recollect whether you have been informed of the painful news from Ohio. Your Aunt Charlotte departed this life about the 22d ult. in childbed, &amp; left a most distressed Husband &amp; 6 or 7 little children. In of these sad bereavements &amp; adverse providences we are led to cry out, O Lord stay Thy hand, "behold the Goodness &amp; severity of God" but we will not give up our shield. We believe &amp; confess`Jesus Christ is the Son of God'. He is merciful &amp; true, `all things shall work together for Good to them who love him'. We rec.d a letter from her Husband who gave all the particulars. She was pious &amp; died with hope &amp; assurance of her acceptance with God. Chris Stover was here about 1st inst &amp; had got Aunt H. to consent to go out with him. They had got to Balto on their way where he.met a man from Tiffin who told him of the sad calamity. This so astonished him that he came back &amp; left H. here &amp; returned alone. We expect to hear from them soon. They all talk of moving back to Md. I have a good deal to say to you but as the mail will close in a few minutes I must defer them. I will however again assure you of the great solicitude &amp; interest constantly entertained for you welfare &amp; happiness by us all &amp; this should stimulate you to a return of some little acknowledgement. Our best love to you &amp; Edward. from yr father D. G. Smith P.S. I sent you a N. Year present. Did you receive it? In a late correspondence with your Uncle E.d he inquires particularly about you.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Margaret F. StevensCharlottsville VirginiaPoliteness of Miss E. E. Bear Harrisonburg February 14, 1853 My Dear Cousin Margaret I have been anxiously looking for the letter you promised in Mrs Stevens letter which came to hand last week. I saw little Willie Bear this morning who told me that Williette was quite sick with fever, and that you had sent for the Dr. I hope she is not very sick and will be well in a short time. Do write and let us know all about it. It makes us all feel quite uneasy to hear of the Dear little creature being sick and away from home. We sent John G. down to inquire of Mr Moore whether she was sick or not he said that she had been sick, but was a great deal better. That we hope to be the true statement about the Dear little Darling. We all think that you had better come home with John Graham that you will see very little pleasure in Washington with your Babe and especially if she is not well. I say come home we all want to see you very much. You have been away long enough for one time. I have been sad all day fearing that Willie was sick and not getting a letter from some one of you all. As Miss Bettie expects to go with John G. in the morning to Charlottsville I thought I would write a few lines by her. Your Ma says she is better today than she was on yesterday. She seems some days better than others, she has coughed less today than usual I think. Aunt Peggy is still here she is as well as usual. She and Aunt Polly have been quite busy knitting a Pair of socks for one of the Boys which she wants to send by Miss Bettie. Mr &amp; Mrs Hoover will leave in the morning. They will feel quite lonely at Mrs Stevens. Lucie regrets their leaving very much she seems very fond of Mrs Hoover. I think she is looking much better than when she first came to Town to Board. Is Mary &amp; Minnie with you yet, and when will they be over, we all want to see them. I hope Addie has recovered from her sore throat. Almost every one here have been complaining of violent colds. I have not heard of much sickness about here only bad colds. There is to be a marriage in Town to morrow night. Miss Susan Stirling and Mr. Goliday. Bro Cross gets that job. he says that he has the Privilege of taking one with him, so he asked me to go, but I guess I will hardly go with his invitation. I told him he must bring us some cake in his pocket. she bought that fine Bonnet at Miss Betties, she will be ever so nice about the Head. It is reported that Sarah Maupin is to be married shortly to Mr. McClung of Madison. I dont know if it is true or not. Malinda Nicholas is still very ill. I dont think that she can hardly last much longer from present appearances. I am going over to sit up to night with her. she sits up perfectly strait all the time cant lie down on account of her Cough. There was a good many of us went to see her Sunday evening, and sung &amp; prayed with her. George Conrad, John G. and Brother Cross were the Gentlemen who were there. Quin seemed as if he would kill himself crying. Poor creature he is to be pitied for he is a very Devoted Husband, he gives all his attentin to her. All the Black ones in the Kitchen are sick with colds. Rob was quite sick for a few days, he is still very hoarse. They are all well as usual at Mrs Stevens. I was over at your Room today how lonely it looks. Willies little face was not there to make it look cheerful &amp; gay to me. Tell Sallie I hear that Edgar is one of the smartest boys in all them parts. I hope she will bring him over to see us and that very soon. I feel very anxious to see the Dear little creature. How I love babies. Dont you think so. I expect to keep house for Miss Bettie while she is away. What a good time I will have by myself. How does William come on since you have been away is his health still good. Aunt Baxter Aunt Polly Cousin Mary Jane join with me in much love to all. Kiss the little ones for us. Do write soon some one of you all to let us hear how Willie is. from your Cousin Fannie tell Carrie to come home as soon as she can. excuse all errors</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Washington Feb 16 1853 Dear Bro. Smith We received yours desireing us to look for sundry articles of furniture therein mentioned, and after a careful examination of said articles in the stores of this City, we beg leave to report as follows—that our humble opinion is that, in all the articles named in your letter you would save money by purchasing in Balt. Carpets such as you want are 100$ to 1.06 &amp; 1.12½ &amp; no great things at that. Chairs such as you want are $18 &amp; $20 per doz. Rockers are 10 &amp; 12$. Sophas $20 &amp; $25. I am sure I could do better in Balt. They are not made here. All such things are brought from N. York &amp; Boston. In Balt. they manufacture them. There are houses in Balt. that sell Northern furniture, but I would not have it. It is made for sale and not for service. I speak particularly as to chairs &amp; sophas. And this is about as much as we can report at present. You had better defer it until after the 1st of March and we will meet in Balt. and do the matter Brown. We are thankful to our Heavenly Father that we are blessed with our usual degree of health, and that we are still endeavouring to keep in view our eternal salvation. We feel our unfaithfulness sometimes very oppressive, but we are upheld by the exceeding great and precious promises of that Word of our salvation which shall endure when time shall be no longer. May we be sanctified &amp; kept by that word of promise through faith unto Eternal Life. Most aff yours M. G. Hamilton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mary HarrisonHarrisonburg Virginia University February 25th 1853 My dear Mother, We received Caroline's letter yesterday and were greatly pained to hear that you still continued so ill. We trust that a merciful Providence will still raise you up from your bed of sickness and once more restore you to your friends. I regret exceedingly that we are so far separated. It would afford us inexpressible happiness to be able to minister to your comfort in any way, &amp; to assist in nursing, or any other duty, but alas! all we can do is to offer our sincere and fervent supplications at a throne of grace in your behalf that the Good Being may continue to vouchsafe his mercy and tender compassion to you, in this your hour of suffering and bodily affliction. Whether in life or death, we feel well assured his sustaining grace will be with you, his promises are never failing "as our day is, so shall our strength be". That such may be your experience is the sincere wish of our hearts. We cannot help cherishing a hope that we shall hear more favorable accounts in the next letter. The girls will of course regularly inform us how you are getting on. We were all much gratified to hear that Margaret Caroline and Williette arrived at home in perfect health and safety. It was most fortunate they went the day they did, the weather has been so very unfavorable subsequently. We seem likely to have more winter than we have had for some time. We indulge a hope that we may possibly get ice after all; under other circumstances I should deprecate the return of cold weather. Most of our family have been more or less sufferers from colds. Edward was very sick yesterday. He had a most distressing pain in his face, superadded to a bad cold in his head. To-day he is a good deal better, and I hope will soon be well again. Bobbie has been quite sick, but is getting well again. I think we have had more sickness in our family this winter than we have had for many years. There has been an unusual amount of sickness among the students. I believe there are no very serious cases at this time. Mr. Hamilton is recovering. We were feeling much solicitude about him at one time. I suppose the girls have told you how ill poor old Mrs. Quinn has been. She is now hovering as it were between life and death. I know you will be happy to hear that she has been humbly and sincerely striving to make her peace with God, and we hope has received his pardoning mercy. When Dr. Harrison and I last saw her she could not speak without great pain and difficulty, but made very significant signs expressive of her faith and trust in her Saviour and her entire reliance on him &amp; his mercy and salvation. I trust devoutly she may exchange this life for a brighter happier existence. Poor Mrs. Nicholas has at last gone to her reward. I feel deeply for good old Mr. Rohr, in the feebleness and infirmities of age, thus to be called on to bear so heavy a trial. In all probability he will ere long be re-united to his loved family. I now beg my best love may be given all the family. Dr. Harrison and the children also send their love. Ever your affectionate daughter, E. L. C. Harrison (over) P. S. I was very sorry in our hurry when Caroline left we forgot to send the money to Fannie. I will enclose it in this letter. E. H.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sherwood July 8th 1853 Dear E I rode over to see Mrs. Stark yesterday, &amp; she says she can probably let you have 20 lbs of butter if you wish as much at a shilling. I could send half up when Fanny goes, and bring the rest up prob.y when I go Tuesday week—if you should want as much please write me on the subject. Mrs. told me she expecte to take a nice hive of honey &amp; I also engaged 12 lbs of that for you. I got some very good from Martin last week. I weighed your carpet balls &amp; took them to Miss Sally-yours weighed 35½ lbs-and what I added 4½ just making 40 lbs-precisely the quantity for the warp. You forgot the canvas. Mrs. Stark has an old maiden aunt from Essex &amp; a little niece come up to pass the summer with her. I am very glad of it, as it would have been very bad for her to have had no female companion in her approaching confinement. We mean to send Betsy to stay ten days or a fortnight with her at the time. I hope it may not come quite as soon as she expects, the middle of this month. She has been suffering so much during the greater part of the time I hope at the last she will do well. We shall be quite gay in this neighbourhood next week. Brother Alexander's daughters are coming Tuesday to spend some days with me, Mrs. R. Carter expects the Miss Randolphs, &amp; Miss Cary from Baltimore, &amp; Nannie Johns has come to pass some time with Mrs. Stevenson. Mr. R. called at Mr. Stevenson's yesterday and said Mr. S. seemed to be highly pleased with the appointment of Mr. Smith &amp; predicts great things of him. D. Lewis will be a candidate for the Proctor's place and Mr. S. seemed very favorably disposed towards him. Mr. Minor is likely to be made chairman. I shall be really sorry if Lucy Downing cannot remain to the wedding. I am glad to say Mr. R. is well again. He went in to Charlottesville Tuesday evening to sign the agreement with Mr. Flannagan etc. stopped at Mr. Douglases Wednesday, &amp; was kept all night by the hard rain. E. wrote me that Annie &amp; herself were very much disappointed that they could not go in on the 29th, Mr. D. had hired hands, and was so busy in his harvest, he could not leave. I was quite surprised to hear Maria &amp; Mr. B. had gone to Culpeper. I thought they had given out the trip. I hope cousin Betsy T. was able this time to give M. some ice cream. Your affectionate sister &amp; love to all. M. R. Rives.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Millington Va.Feby 26 Miss Carolino E. HarrisonHarrisonburg Rockingham Virginia Midway Feb 26th 1853 My dear Sis. Carrie: I am truly sorry to hear of dear Mother's illness and very much surprised too, for I had had no intimation of her being more ailing than usual, until I received your letter; save a confused message sent me by cousin Robert Rodes, which I construed more favourably than I should have done. Surely she is being refined in the furnace of affliction, and being made mete for the Kingdom of Heaven. She has long since casted her care on Him who careth for her, &amp; I know he will watch over and take care of her; &amp; when she has done and suffered his will on earth, will take her to himself where she will spend an endless Eternity in singing his praise, with loved ones who are gone before. I hope she will yet be spared to us many days. Still feel an earnest desire that her days should be longer than mine, but Lord, thy will, not mine be done. All that I ask is that when called, each may have on the wedding garment ready to enter into the marriage supper of the Lamb-there there shall be no affliction, nor sorrows, no parting nor sighing, no mourning nor tears, and we shall be happy happy through the endless ages of Eternity. Oh! Carrie to this end let us live. Let us die daily to the world, and live afresh in Christ, our Saviour. I would be very glad if it were so that I could be with Mother now. Minnie, I think, would be a great comfort to her. She was very much distressed when I told her that her Grandma was sick and said she wanted to go to her Aunt Mary's house to see her. She often speaks of you, and says she wants to see you. I feel sorry that so happened that she did not go over with you; it may be all for the best however, we cant tell. Addie has gotten a good deal better-will go to Town tomorrow (if the weather be good) ready to commence school Monday. She still looks pale and thin. Pa has been greatly ailing for several days—is suffering with his stomach, &amp; is very much troubled by the return of water rash. I have suffered a good deal too with my side, have several times felt like having Pneumonia; but I hope to escape. Several of the servants are complaining also, caused by the sudden changes in the weather, I presume. I have not heard from Brother's since you left, but hope to hear tommorrow. I am very sorrow to hear of poor Mrs. Nicholas' death. Oh! let us heed the warning, "be ye also ready". I know his feeling. Nought but desolation pervades his heart. To die is the doom of all the living-and soon we will sleep too, the long sleep. I am glad to hear that Willie stood the ride over so well, and hope that she will have good health, now that she is at her old home again. The family here regret that Sister Mag. didn't get out here with her. I intended writing a letter to you and sister Mary, of a business nature, but cant do it now. I have been thinking more about making some permanent arrangement about living and making a proposition to you, which I will mention some other time, for my side and eyes are hurting me so that I can write no more tonight. The family unite with me in sending much love to you, Sisters Mary and Mag, Fannie, &amp; Mother. Minnie sends all kisses. May the Lord comfort and support my poor dear Mother is my prayer. Let me hear from her again as soon as practicable. Ever your afflicted Sister Mary</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Mary J. HarrisonHarrisonburg Virginia Univ. of Virginia Feb. 26. 1853 My dear Mary Jane, I thank you most heartily for your letter received this afternoon. We have been very anxious about dear Mother, and it was something to know that she was even a little better, We cannot but feel sad to think of her continued sufferings, although we know that it is our duty to submit in this, as in all things, to the will of our Heavenly Father. Try to encourage her to cast all her care on the kind &amp; loving Savior—to put all her trust in Him—asking Him, not doubting that he will hear &amp; grant her prayers of faith, to give her the grace to commit herself resignedly into his heavenly keeping. You know how much she is given to despondency. Encourage her to believe the gracious promises of God, that, if we put our trust in Him, we shall not be confounded—-that, committing ourselves to His care, he will guide &amp; comfort us, &amp; at last save us by his power. I wish I could be with you, knowing your care &amp; anxiety, and that it would afford dear Mother some comfort. But I cannot well leave home. I am embarrassed by the care of my own family, by the duties of my school, and by those of the Chairman's office. Just now our sick ones are better. Edward has been quite sick, and is yet complaining, but not with measles. Bobbie &amp; Peachey Charley have had bad colds, but they are decidedly better, as are Rosalie also &amp; Mary. No sign of measles among them yet. We were glad that Margaret &amp; Caroline were so fortunate in getting home before the weather changed so much for the worse, and hope that Williette may suffer no injury. Poor Mrs. Quinn died night before last of the effects of Pneumonia. She died trusting confidently in the atonement of Christ, and we doubt hot has gone to a peaceful home in Heaven. Please tell Mother that I would come to see her if I could. That I exceedingly regret that my occupation deprives me of the pleasure of being with her in her sickness. But that she must try to remember that the hand of her Heavenly Father is ever over her, &amp; that she must patiently &amp; confidently rely upon Him. If she should be tempted to unbelief &amp; to repine under her painful afflictions, she must always remember that Christ died for poor sinners, and that God having given us his Son will with him freely give us all things-that he will withhold no good thing from them that trust Him. She cannot doubt his mercy, goodness, and love. She cannot doubt that he will give her whatever is needful for her eternal welfare. If he send afflictions, it is our business to submit patiently, and to rejoice that he knows &amp; will bestow what is best for us.

      <field name="fulltext">Richmond Feby 27, 1853 Prof. F. H. Smith My dear Sir Since the rec.t of your very welcome letter I have been so occupied either with business, or Society, as to have fallen in arrears in my correspondence. From Dr. Schele we were pleased to learn that you &amp; Mary &amp; our other good friends at the Univ. were well, &amp; the session proceeding tranquilly. I need not say how much I have been gratified by the favourable mention I have heard of your professional labors. This is what I expected foretold. Early in the month the Senate passed a bill for the completion &amp; publication of the Geol. Map &amp; Report. It is now on th table in the lower house, &amp; will probably be disposed of today o tomorrow. It vests the entire control of the work in the hands o the Sec.y of State &amp; the geologist. These are the only terms on which I would consent to engage in the work, for it is the only mode by which it can be kept otu of the hands of under-bidding jobbers in printing, who here as elsewhere would ruin the work. The bill is sustained in the House of Delegates by most of the educated members &amp; generally I believe by those who are from the mining districts, but its fate is I think quite uncertain, so near the close of the session. Business is said to be managed ve much by out-door workers &amp; of these there are none to trouble th selves for the Survey. For myself, I revolt at what is called lobbying, although a ariter in Saturday's Enquirer calls me a Talleyrand of Lobby-members. Your kindness was certainly largely drawn upon in the matter of the apparatus. Before my brother Robert came to the Univ. none of the Philos. App: was ever taken to the Chem. lectur room, &amp; I only allowed it afterwards to a small extent because he repaid the favour to my department by valuable manual assistance as well as the use of agents &amp; glass ware. As I told you last Spring when talking of the relation between the Philos. &amp; Chem. Chairs &amp; their possible interference, the Dept. of N. Phil. cannot without injury give up the Imponderables. In strictness by far the greater part of the topics included under this head appertain to Mechan. Philos. At the Univ. of Va. it will I suppose always be necessary for the Chem. Prof. to shape his course somewhat independently of the Dept. of N. Philos. as bu few of his Med. students, attend or have attended that school. He must therefore give a brief acct. of the imponderables dwelling chiefly on their Chemical relations, &amp; he ought not I think to say more of their general Physics than is necessary to make the rest intelligible. Such subjects as Magnetism-Electro Magnetism, Mech. Electricity &amp; nearly all of Heat &amp; Light are the property of the Chair of Nat. Philos. Chemistry proper has become so vast a subject that both in treatises &amp; in lectures the tendency now is to exclude any treatment of these topics exceeding a b brief outline. Such are my opinions designed simply as a frank communication to yourself. I regret that the artist Mr. Martin has had such inadequate materials for making a portrait of our dear friend Courtena I have been looking at the picture in the hope of suggesting useful changes. Considering his data I think the painter has done remarkably well; yet he has only partially succeeded in giving the expression of the face. The chin &amp; mouth are truly given, but I miss the distinctive characters of the eyes &amp; brow. Perhaps to others the likeness would seem more complete. From some other pictures in Mr. M's studio I have formed a favorable opinion of his ability in making a likeness, &amp; regret the more that he has not in the present case had the benefit of a personal knowledge of the subject. Houchens must be in error as to the fragments of the Piezo-meter, which I am sure were left in the Apparatus room. On discovering the instrument to be broken, I borrowed one from my brother Robert for the use of the Lecture room, When I unpack my books now in Boston, I will overhaul my vols of the "Scientific Memoirs" &amp; let you know what are missing, &amp; whether any are duplicates. I formerly had a large crayon drawing of the Blue Sulphur Springs, lying in the garret. It was fastened on a board about 2 ft square &amp; placed in a shallow box. If it is still in the garret or has been taken with the minerals to the new building, I will thank you to let me know. Should it not be found I will have to unpack many of my large boxes in search of it. Mrs. Rogers joins me in love to Mary &amp; kind remembrances to all the family "over the way". Asking to be remembered to all my Univ. friends, I remain As ever yrs sincerely W. B. Rogers The chief opponent in the H. of Del. of the Geol. Bill is I understand Mr. Tomlin now one of the visitors of the Univ.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg Va.Mar 14 Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Leesburg March 14th 1853 My dear son Francis I have lately been corresponding with Col. J. W. Ware of Clarke county, who has the selling of a farm of 640 acres of Land in Culpeper Co. in answer to my inquiries, made probably in Jan. he said that the tract was very superior, well located and fine for grazing or wheat raising etc. etc. &amp; that 50$ pr acre was his price, but that 25,000 dollars would buy the farm. He also described the buildings &amp; improvements, which however did not please me, which together with the heavy price deterred me. I told him in reply that I would probably visit that county in early Spring &amp; would then look at it. In the meantime however not to let my application interfere with any negotiation he might have on hand with any other person, as there was great uncertainty of my becoming the purchaser. The matter remained in this state untill a few days ago. I rec.d a letter from him, offering the farm at 20,000 which is just 31.25 pr acre. This is a considerable decline &amp; has induced me to wish to see it. He says that if I will make up my mind soon, at that offer, that he was about on his way to Richmond (his letter dated 8th inst.) &amp; would be absent about 10 days &amp; he would expect to hear from me soon after his return. I have concluded to take a trip to Culpeper Ct. House next week, leaving here on Monday 21st inst. by stage to Alex.a thence on tues day by the Orange &amp; Alex.a R. R.d to Culpeper where I am told the cars arrive about 12 M.leaving Alex. about 9 A.M. I enclose Col. Ware's advertisement that you may know the location of the farm, &amp; I invite you to meet me there if you can arrange your business to get leave of absence for 3 or 4 days. You would have some 40 miles by R. R.d &amp; stage to get there, if you could send me an answer to get here by Saturday 19th &amp; let me know whether you could meet me I would be glad. If not in time to reach here you could direct to Alex, so as to arrive on Monday night. If you come get a letter of introduction if you can to some one who would give us desirable information as to farm for sale. If nothing prevents I expect to make the trip, very bad weather or indisposition might prevent, of which I might apprise you by Saturday if I change my mind, which however is improbable, at present, &amp; if I go I should be exceedingly glad to meet you. Possibly you could accompany me home &amp; spend a week with us. Get all the information you can, &amp; come well posted in regard to farms for sale etc. I feel now in the humor of a purchase if a bargain can be had. I am a little surprised &amp; chagrined that you &amp; Edw.d do not write oftener. We have no news to communicate. I believe I stated in one of my letters to you or Edw.d that Adelines youngest child was burnt. It survived but a few days, being so badly burnt, resulting from total carelessness for which Ann &amp; the Mother ought to have been punished. They left the little thing in the room by itself where a stove was in full blast &amp; it got to the door &amp; opened &amp; played with the fire etc. We are all in tolerable health for which Blessing we try constantly to cultivate a spirit of thankfulness to the Giver of all Good. I rec.d a letter of yours dated 18th Jan. only about the middle of Feb.y &amp; I think there is an interesting letter of yours still on the road. I refer to an answer of yours to a long letter about important matters I wrote you in Nov. &amp; which answer you seem to refer to in several letters of yours since rec.d. I have never rec.d an answer specially to that letter of Nov. I expect about the last of this month to pay Raleigh Colston the first deferred payment on my purchase from him amt.g to about 2150$—due 1st Apl. the deeds have not yet been made, but I want to comply strictly with my part of the contract, which requires in addition to the 4000$ cash payment, an annual payment of 2100 on the 1st day of Apl.for four years, with int. from 1st Jan 1852, for which I was to give my 4 personal Bonds, when he made the deed. I think it will be best to send the check to you &amp; let you ride out &amp; pay him, if he does not come here after it, taking his rec.t in proper form. I think I will do so if it will be convenient to you to attend to the payment. Be sure to answer this promptly, if in time to get your answer here, otherwise send it to Alex, so that I may get it in the way, or both failing thro the uncertainty of the mails then of you cant meet me write to Culpeper C.H. Our love to you both. Yrs affectionately D. G. Smith If I was certain of reaching you sooner I w.d leave home about Thursday next, but must be content to wait. How is Edw.d getting on in his studies. Will he graduate creditably?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Louisvill March 17 1853 My dear Friend How soothing to me was your kind consideration in writing to me the particulars of the death of one who was indeed dear to me, from all the touching incidents &amp; good relations of friend and neighbour for allmost 20 years, the Mr Wertenbakers had been thoughtful &amp; kind in writing of her severe &amp; protracted illness, her death and the disposition of her small saveings; but your letter was so full so feeling, it conveyed in full force the sad but happy result. All my letters to her have as far as I thought expediant, have been intended to draw her mind to a happier world, for felt the truth of this being forever a blight and dark one to her. Let me tell you, I had more cause to love that humble friend than anyone at the U. V. was aware of she alone except the Proctor knew of our destitution at Mrs. Bleatermans house, she supplied us from day to day with food, appeald to old Mrs. Lewis for wood, informd Mr. William Rogers &amp; Mr. Brigs of our situation &amp; they gave her money. She sent us so much, I rofused to take it from her pitance, she then told me she had asked these gentlemen for aid. Necesity made me accept, I offerd to let Colonel Woodly have articles that I felt belonged to me as gifts, telling him of my reduced circumstances, he refused to take them, saying I had no right to sell them, but offerd me no assistance &amp; told me the professors had lost all sympathy for me because I would not sell my negroes. He knew I had no right to sell the negroes of my children and as was afterwards shewn in court I could not make a bill. When Mrs. Woodly was taken in labour, he came for me at night I went to her(you know I was allways with her at these times) after that he sent me some supplys. My whole frame tingled with pride to be paid for what I had often given to her, as friend &amp; neighbour. I could not ask extort of these wives help from milk. I would not involve my good son Dr. Conway further, and should have been driven to the necessity of beging if it had not have been for small sums of money sent me from a distance to buy keepsakes for myself &amp; daughters. Nanny Hunter gave my poor Nanny a $5 gold piece, Mrs. Patterson sent me $20. Oh when Mrs McKennys flowers, fruits and nicetys from her table came over, it tantalized our feelings. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Wertenbaker contributed substantials, but the did not know the extent. After I left I wrote a circular to the professors, explaining how it was I did not sell, and telling of our extreme want for four months, as an evidence that I could not sell legally. I did not want such noble men, such friends and gentlemen from whom I had allways received such marked &amp; grattifying attention, as I believed from a knowledge of my unblemishd generous, and correct course, to change there opinion of me. I directed this circular to Dr. Cabell, with a request to shew it to the professors. He did so, &amp; wrote me a most affectionate reply and said all he could to soothe me. I heard from others that the Proctor had told the Professors that I had in my distress at our difficulty overdrawn my trials &amp; that I had never sufferd for any thing. I recapitulate this affair to shew what cause to love my dear departed friend I have after her sore &amp; mortifying sorrow, offerd her a home &amp; tender &amp; heartfelt sympathy in my house, but she allways declined. I would have nursed her &amp; supported her to the last moment in which I would have been kindly aided by my children. Little did I think when she was a barfooted washerwoman, living in a hut in the meddow &amp; I sending cold victuals, and now and thenparsels of tea to her, I was litterly casting my bred upon the waters, &amp; that she was to administer good victuals to me &amp; mine. I have nothing to tell you my beloved friend to turn the old and dreadful trial from your feeling heart. Our removal to the West has been most unfortunate for me, it seems I came out here to make a grave yard. Font, Mr. Conway, then a grand child, then Dr. Frank Conway, then and 17 servants all in 9 years, manny of the negroes were children. I have never been reconsiled for one moment &amp; feel as if I were on a steam boat &amp; just tied to the bank of an ever flooing river. I had the pleasure of having the lovely daughter of my true &amp; beloved friends Mr. &amp; Mrs. Saunders at our house a week ago on her way to Callifornia. It was a mellancholy pleasure. She was happy &amp; looked determination, sence, &amp; resignation. I was delighted with Dr. Pegram, he looked a real man full of &amp; tenderness. I had heard of Margrets &amp; the Drs. kindness in taking his &amp; her neices to live with them. You say you are afraid to tell items of news, least I may have been informed of them. No indeed I have not a correspondent in or about the U. V. or Charlottsvill. I made several offers to draw occasionally some of my old friends into an exchange of love &amp; gossip, but I found them tardy &amp; I quit. How our hearts bound with gladness to know of the prosperity of our beautiful &amp; cherished home. Do you know I call it the Swedenborgians heaven. They believe that we are not to leave this earth, but our spirit linger, and all that was repulsive in life will be changed, all of the best &amp; brightest, most noble &amp; intellectual of people remain at the place they were at in life, all obnoxious animals here banished, reptiles, the most beautiful and oderifeus flowers, purest air, best water and all that is grand in nature they have. Now where is that but at the University. I had but one interview with mrs. Smith but that was very prepossessing. I hear from her friends she is delighted with all of you &amp; everything. Let me tell you I was sounded &amp; consulted by the medical facoulty before Dr. Cabbel was offerd a situation in the medical school in this city. I knew he would not accept but I wanted him to have the honour. I expatiated on his merits, acquirements, his popularity in such terms that Sarha was interogated to know if I was not shewing of my oratory had lost sight of the man. When the Dr. declined I said I knew he would but as they the western men were disposed to detract from Virginia &amp; our University I wanted to let them see they could not get one of them. We have often heard of the continued health of our old &amp; valued friend Maria &amp; of your papa too. I wrote to your Maria about two years ago &amp; beged her to ask your papa to write to me. I wanted to put it on my center table to boast of. Why did you not tell me how you look after blooming and basing so many times. You know allthough a rose bush is as fragrant and as highly prized as ever, but it looks after many summers, seraggy and ugly. How is ti with you my Rose Mundi. How str strange to my ear &amp; recollection of you to hear you talk of your grandchild. You have indeed been one of fortunes kind and peculiar case, no sorrowing, no poverty, no home trials, a husband to love honour &amp; obey. Write again dear friend and tell me of your dear good Dr., often did he sooth &amp; shield me. Tell me fo Mary. I hear she's to be married. And of your sons I want to hear. I am proud of my sons, allthough not men of tallent they are honourable, industrious, affectionate. I look on them as Virginia gentlemen. Sar ah has changed greatly in appearance. She has sufferd more from our losses than I. Harry was her pet her love and occupied all her heart. Sarah will never marry, she has discarded three widdowers, because they had children. Fanny &amp; are this winter with Bet it would take a whole letter to tell you of Bet &amp; Bets. She is prosperous in every way, she is now the mother of six children. Mr Shields is in all respects a son, but I will not let either he or Mr. Atkinson know of my difficultys. I have visited them both once, they bore my expences. I have been all through this long letter, making room to tell you of Mrs. Bonnysastle. She has been here since June last with Ann Robbinson. Mrs. Bonnycastle has improved with years &amp; experiance, she is now a most charming woman, looks young, is fond of dress &amp; amusement, but does not enter into it in this city as Ann &amp; her husband are verry pious members of the Episcopal church. Mary is the most scrupulous young person I have heard of. She will not speak on the sabbath, although elegantly dressed for church, and bestows more time on her person on that day than any other. She goes to privit balls &amp; dances. Mrs. Bonnycastle appeared at a privit ball in a white sattin, with white lace over it, short sleeves, low neck, white plumes in her hair, lined with gold, all other adornment in the way of jewelry. She is not pleased with Louis vill &amp; is anxious to get away. Sarah &amp; I do enjoy her sosiety so much, &amp; she seems delighted to be with us. Dont this letter remind you of the french woman, in the tales of the castle who had endured so many trials and sufferd all sorts of sorrows &amp; would sit down under the shade of the tree &amp; account then to her friend with convulsive sobs. Should a butterfly wing its way in sight she would run after it with the gayety of a child. Thus you will think of me. Not so I wish to let you see our friends and neighbours. Let me tell you how near I was haveing Mrs. Emet &amp; Jane to see me summer before last. They were on there way home from Charlston by the way of Cincinata &amp; wrote me they would be at our house in a day or two &amp; that George Carr would be with them. Just think of our delight when they got to Cincinata they heard the Cholera was in the citty, wrot me an affectionate letter &amp; left us to regreat the event. I feel a glow of satisfaction when I think Mrs. Emit has visited Burmuda, if Mrs. Tucker could have been spared to enjoy it with them. I have more things to keep that dear &amp; valued friend in memory than any one I ever knew that was not a near relation. I cannot leave you without sending my kind remembrance to Charles, tell him my servants are well &amp; happy. The grown servants who are dead was Polly, Peter Willis and Davy. Dear friend, love again. Your letter sooth &amp; delighted us. M. T. C.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Washington 22 March (1853) Dear Bro. Smith It has been a long spell since we heard from you. What is the matter! Have you removed to your new Farm! Or are you opposed to writing in the present Administration! We live in the same place and would be as glad as ever to hear how you all are. Yesterday our new superintendent of the Census, Mr. DeBow made a clean sweep, and turned out every Clerk except Six or Seven with the view of reorganization of a more permanent Bureau, which will be organized tomorrow. He has promised me a place in that Bureau, and he seems to be a true man (altho a Locofoco). I am in hope of getting an increase of Salery in the present Administration, and Eliza is in hope that they will dissmiss me entirely as she don't like Washington. It makes very little difference any way as we can do very well without it. I had rather have some employment however. They have turned out very few regular Clerks as yet. But on the 30th of June every one goes out by Law, and then all the clerks in the employ of Govern.t at Wash.gtn will be appointed by examination before a committee of chief clerks in the respective Bureaus. This is, no doubt, a skeme to get all the Whigs out of Office and put in Locos. The Senate is still in session confirming appointments. The spring is opening upon us in all its beauty, and we feel thankful to our heavenly Father for the kindness of His providence by which we have been spared through another winter. But we are drawing nearer and nearere as time wears away to the close of our probation in this world, and we feel more and more the importance of getting ready for a home in Eternity. And O what are all the pleasures of time when compared to those promised to the child of God beyond this world of sorrow. May we all share those bright joys of the Heavenly world when we are done with the scenes of this. My health has been tolerable of late. Eliza is about as usual. E. Ridgely grows very fast, and often talks of visiting Leesburg next summer. She and her Mother have just returned from a visit to Balt.o. Mary Kate Davis will be married about the middle of next month. I write this item for Ellen. I did not get to conference, not being able to leave about that time. Am glad you have got Bro. Rogers back again, and hope he will have great success this year in his delightful work. Bro. Slicer has been appointed to collect money to build a large church in this City in a central place for the accommodations of strangers. This seems to be an age of church buildings, and while we get a great many fine churches we should be careful to be building up ourselves in the faith of the Gospel. We require frequent stimulants to prompt us to our work as Christians. Let us try to be faithful to our high and Holy calling. You will now except me to draw to a close. We send our love to you all. Let us hear from you soon. Pray for us. Most affection.ly &amp; truly M. G. Hamilton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Mrs. Mary HarrisonHarrisonburg, Virginia University of Virginia Mar. 23. 1853 My dear Mother, Mary Jane's letter (for which I owe her many thanks, especially as I am aware how difficult it must be for her to find the time and opportunity to write so frequently) reached me Sunday afternoon, and gave us the satisfaction of knowing that you had been improving a little. I trust that, through the blessing of Our Heavenly Father, you may gradually regain your customary health, and that you may grow better more rapidly as the weather becomes milder. We have not had very much sickness here apart from the measles, although many have suffered with colds. In &amp; about Charlottesville there have been more than the usual number of deaths, some from Pneumonia. Our own family is now pretty well, excepting that Flora is complaining. The vhildren have pretty well recovered, and, what is remarkable, have thus far escaped the measles. I hope that Mr. Cross has entirely recovered. He must have found it very difficult to attend to his public duties while suffering so much from indisposition. Give him my kind regards. I need not ask him to afford you such advice &amp; consolation as he can &amp; will give you. I trust you are abundantly comforted by divine grace, and that you are able to cast all your care on your Savior. Dont yield to any temptation to unbelief, but strive to be a simple &amp; childlike believer in God's promises through Christ Jesus. I hope Margaret has recovered, and Mary, and that the children are well. We were sorry to learn that both Mary &amp; Margaret were complaining. I was pleased to hear that Minnie had not forgotten her uncle Gess. I have not time to write now more than these few lines. I thought it would be agreeable to you to hear from us, and determined to write, even if it were only the shortest note. Affectionately yr. son, Gessner Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paid Leesburg Va.Mar 25 Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Va. Leesburg Va. March 24 1853 My dear Son Francis I have just returned from Culpeper and was very much disappointed at not meeting you there, and also at not recieving an answer to my letter on my way there, as I had requested you to send. On my return yesterday, I found at Alexandria your letter, enclosing one to Mr. Broadus, which of course is useless now. I found the farm that I went to look at, in such a delapidated condition that I at once concluded to have nothing to do with it. Ther are, however, as I found many other farms in market in that neighborhood, some very handsome and desirable. I became acquainted with several gentlemen there, among whom was Dr. Slaughter apparently a very estimable gentleman who was very communicative. Also his brother, Colonel Slaughter, and Dr. Welford. These gentlemen told me of a variety of farms in that neighborhood which could be bought tho' at advanced prices, owing to the railroad improvements, say from 16 to 30$. One belonging to the Bradford family had about 800 cares, beautifully located &amp; well improved with buildings, about 3 miles N. E. of C.H. It is said it could be bought at about 20$ pr. acre. This farm I was on. Old Con.l Slaughter the father of the Doctor has a farm about 4 m. east of the C.H. containing about 600 acres, said by the Dr. to be a good farm, though falling rather in the low lands, of the chocolate description. It can be bought for about 16$ pr. acre. This I did not see. If you had met me, I should have remained a day or two longer &amp; made a more minute &amp; general examination. The country around appears to be healthy &amp; handsome, but the lands are by no means prime. Probably you could make some further inquiries through some of your friends. In the mean time I shall be riding through Loudon &amp; Fauquier to see if I can be better pleased here than there. Write me soon upon this subject as I shall want your aid in making a selection. Enclosed you will find a certificate of deposit for 2150$ endorsed for the use of Mr. Raleigh Colston, also a corresponding receipt for him to sign. These you will please take to him at once Deliver the certificate to him, and get his signature to the receipt and re-inclose it to me. I took the certificate with me, intending to send it by you from Culpeper, which scheme of course failed. You will see the importance of attending to this matter at once and of acknowledging the receipt even before taking it out, that I may be apprised of its safe arrival, the uncertainty of the mail being such that it might miscarry. I should like to apprize the Bank in case of miscarriage so as to stop payment. I shall also write to Edward by this mail &amp; will send him a draft for 40$ which will probably carry him through. I will pay you for all expenses incurred by you in attending to this business We are all well. Our love to you &amp; E. Yours affectionately D. G. Smith P. S. I had a very pleasant trip to Culpeper. The weather was delightful.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Va.Aug. 3 Miss Caroline HarrisonHarrisonburg Virginia University April 2nd 1853 My dear Carolino, I cannot so well convince you of the great pleasure your letter afforded me, as by writing immediately to express our gratitude and thankfulness to hear that Mother is so much better. We trust the next letter will inform us that she is in her usual health. From our not hearing for a longer time than usual we hopefully inferred she must be better, and were truly happy to find a realization of our wishes. We were much concerned to hear there were still so many invalids among you, We shall be greatly relieved to hear that Margaret, Mary K. &amp; Mary Jane have again been restored to good health, and enjoying the mild balmy air of spring. Since you last heard from us, death has again visited our little community, and taken another member in the morning of life Mrs. Wards grandson William Swann, who never entirely recovered from the measles took cold and was seized with pneumonia and typhoid fever, which soon carried him off. Saturday last, the ninth day of his illness, he expired! From the first of his attack he seemed to have forebodings of his approaching end, and manifested a deep concern on the subject of his coul's salvation. Though a kind hearted affectionate boy, he was disposed to be a little wild, and we hope he has been taken from the evils to come, where sin and sorrow are no more felt or feared. His poor grandmother is deeply afflicted, as are his other relatives—Both Mary Briggs and Margaret Swann are interested on the subject of religion, and we trust their affliction may prove a blessing to them. It was a most touching and solemn spectacle to see his youthful associates bearing in his body to the Chapel, whore his funeral was preached by Mr. Gibson, who gave us a most interesting and impressive discourse from this text, "My son give me thine heart." Our family are all well at this time. Mr. Broadus Maria and Eliza went out yesterday evening to Mr. Wm. Farish's to remain until to-morrow. I am sure they will have a very pleasant visit. Eliza does not talk much better than when you saw her, she makes herself entirely understood by signs. I suppose it will be some time yet before she speaks. Bobbie's head still continues most obstinately bald. Every now and then I hear something to encourage a hope that he will untimately be blessed with a full suit of hair. Some children are five years old before they have any. I should like to see sweet little Williette. I suppose, but for her being so delicate she would have walked some time ago. I was very sorry to hear dear little Minna had sore eyes. I hope they are well by this time. She is doubtless as smart and interesting as ever. We are likely to have some changes next year which will surprise every one very much. Both Mr. Rogers and Dr. Smith intend resigning their professorships, the former wishes to be with his brothers, and to help his brother Henry in his geological labours, besides, I presume he thinks his wife would prefer being with her family, especially as her father is aged and infirm. We will be extremely sorry to part with them. The University will sustain a great loss in both cases. Since Mr. Guthrie, the father-in-law of Dr. Smith has a place in the Cabinet, Dr. S. is obliged to return to Louisville to take care of his immense property. He is said to be worth a million. They are very amiable pleasant people. I wish we may be as fortunate in their successors whoever they may be. The Dr. invited all the ladies of the place with the gentlemen of their families to come to his laboratory yesterday afternoon to see some experiments. We went and were very much gratified. He showed us some very pretty and instructive. I wish we had more frequently an opportunity of seeing such things. Mary McGuffey kept her secret so well, we never found out until the return of her lover from Philadelphia this spring, that she was engaged. The gentleman is a Dr. Stuart of Pennsylvania. He does not know where he will establish himself, consequently she does not know when she will be married, not for some time I presume—nor will Honrietta either. Mrs. Dr. McKennie has a son. She has not been well since her confinement. Mrs. McKennie has a good deal of troubles, her servants are so constantly sick, she is greatly confined by them. Her old woman died this morning. I presume you have heard Mrs. Stevens lost her cook. I was very sorry to hear it. I saw her in town a few evenings ago, she was looking very well &amp; Adoline Rodes also. I am almost afraid to say what I hear these days, some things are so ridiculous and prove so utterly untrue. It was reported for some time that poor old Betsey Stevens (whom you may probably have seen on the road, where she is pretty generally to be found) was eaten by a bear that got lose, and was running about the country. Whilst we were waiting to hear it confirmed some one said there was no doubt of it, for a gentleman who sat as one of the Coroners inquest saw her and told them of it. Shortly afterwards the old woman was seen and when told of the concern of her neighbours, said she "knew it was a story when she first heard it," for very good reasons I should say. All the family join me in much love to Mother-Margaret-Mary F. Mary Jane, Fannie and yourself. I am glad to hear aunt Baxter is better, give our love to her. Ever your attached sister, E. L. C. Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Univ.y of Virginia April 10. 1853 My dear Mary Jane, I received your letter this afternoon, and assure you that I am very thankful to you for writing. I know so well how difficult comparatively it must be for you to find the opportunity &amp; inclination to write, expecially suffering as you have been from indisposition, and burdened with so much care &amp; anxiety, that I am truly obliged to you for favoring me with a letter. Indeed I could wish that you had been able to send us more cheering news: but we must not allow ourselves to be cast down above measure. Sorrow and affliction seem to be the way through which God, our Heavenly Father, designs that we should walk. Let us remember that these may, through divine grace, be converted into real blessings. Only let us be patient &amp; submissive, humbly trusting in God, and all will work together for our good. Be careful not to expose yourself beyond what is indispensably necessary—and strive not to be anxious about the affairs of the family. In this, as in every thing else, we have a right, in we believe in God's good Providence, to commit our cause to Him. Do what you can, consistently with your health, but wuthout endangering it, and then doubt not that every thing will be ordered for the best. I still hope that Mother may be raised up from this sickness. I still hope that she will be sustained and comforted in all her affliction by the consolations of religion-that her faith will be abundantly strengthened, and her hope brightened. And if God shall be for us, why need we fear any evil? But, above all, let us continually strive to submit ourselves humbly &amp; thankfully to the will of our Heavenly Father. We feel great sympathy for Mary in her affliction, &amp; for Margaret in her anxiety. May God grant them support and comfort. We had not even heard of Mrs. Gen Lewis' illness. How mysterious are the ways of Providence! Of all Judge Lomax' daughters only Charlotte remains, and of all his children only three. I cannot but feel how many of my old friends are called away. I too am beginning to find that I am among the smaller number left behind. We ought to be ready too. We ought to live as in view of the grave to which are hastening. But for the extreme pressure of my duties, which demand all my time, I would certainly try to come over, if but for a day. I cannot now see how I cant get through my work. If you need any thing, let me know it, and you may be certain I will promptly do any thing in my power. What you most want is somebody to take charge of the family affairs. This, of course, must yet lie in the hands of Providence to appoint. But you may want money for this &amp; that necessary for your comfort. I enclose ten dollars to apply as you please. I would send more, but that I am just now rather straitened for cash having a large bond to pay off. Give my love to all the family, &amp; believe Yr. devoted brother, Gessner Harrison My dear Sister Mollie don't think me forgetful. (in another hand-writing—E. D. G.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">of Washington the roads are so miserable across the mountains. I am getting more anxious about home every day. I do hope this winterrwill finish William off with a City life. I think he is getting tired, he says he will stay no longer than the fourth of March. He is going to see Pierce go into office. Lawrence comes to see me every day he is pleased with his situation, says he wishes I would not go away. Mr. and Mrs. Deneale have gone to Washington to spend several days. I often think of you all when I am eating and enjoying Oysters and sweet potatoes. Mama would enjoy the latter so much. You all must feel very lonely without Mr. Cross when will he return. How is Sallie Herring health. I would like to hear she was so poorly when I left home. I hope Mama has been much better since I heard from Home till the next letter will be to her. I thought I would have written to Mrs. Stevens before this but really I have so little of interest to write that I postpone it hoping to have something that will entertain her very much. Give my love to her and Lucie and tell them Williette send them many kisses as well as her Grandmother Harrison Cousin Fannie and Aunt Mary. Give much love to aunt Baxter, Cousin Martha, Cousin Julia and all my friends who enquire for me. William join me in love to Mama Fannie and yourself. How does Clarissa come on. And aunt Sallie is she still cooking. I reckon she does not make so much salt rising bread as she did when I was at home. I wish I had a loaf of her nice bread and some good butter for Williette and myself. I have nearly filled my sheet with one thing and another. I hope it will afford you some pleasure. Write very soon. Just returned from dinner after three oclock dined on roast goose, escolloped Oysters, sweet potatoes very nice soup. And then we had potatoe pudding and fritters. It looks very much this evening like snow. I must close. Lawrence has just come in for me to walk somewhere or other. I may jump in an omnibus and go to Mitchell Conrads. Write often and do not let me get sick on account of not getting a letter. I remain your affectionate Sister Margaret P. S. I hope to see Mary if I go to the University. If the weather is such that I cannot carry Willie and the roads are passable I will go out to Mr. Rodes. I have not heard from Caroline for a week she then expected to go to see Mary. I did not answer her last letter thinking probably she had gone. I feel some hesitancy in going to brothers. His family is so large it seems almost an imposition to go there to spedn anytime, although I know they are glad to see me. I remain your Sister Margaret Dear Fannie, I send you Margaret's letters, she is anxious for you to make Williette a bonnet, perhaps you had better come in, in the morning &amp; see about it. I know of no way to send it, but by the mail bag, that would not be very safe. Ma is as usual. I wrote to Brother yesterday &amp; a note to Carrie. Have you written? Mr. Smallwood called to see you yesterday, but did not tell his business. With love to Cousin Julia. Your Cousin Mary Jane</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Francis H. Smith My dear Frank I know that you do not expect to hear from me, but I thought it might afford you a little pleasure to know that I was thinking of you, and therefore will enclose you a little note in a letter I am writing to Ma. I hope that you have not given up your intention of coming out here. The country air would do you good I am sure. Henry Rives and I take a ride on horseback every morning, which I enjoy greatly of course. It seems to me that such exercise suits me peculiarly. I play chess with Henry too at night, but he always beats me. When you come you must join me against him. I wonder if you miss me much, you do not know how glad I shall be to see you again, and resume our morning walks. I wonder too if you rise early enough to visit the spring and go to prayers. I have been sitting up rather late since I have (torn) dearest. I daresay you will to send you these few lines Ever</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore Apl 13 1853 Dear Bro. Smith It seems difficult to tell why it is that we have not heard from any of you so long. We have concluded that it was because we are out of Office and unsettled. You are aware that on the 21st of last month the Census Bureau was disolved and with the rest I was put out. They promised to give me another place in a m more permanent Bureau, but they have not done so yet, and I dont care much about it, as all the clerks are to be turned out on the 30th of June next by a Law of the last Congress, and it is understood that no Whig will be suffered to remain after that. The Chief Clerk sent for me and asked me if I was a Whig. I indignantly told him I was, and unless I saw better reasons to change than I have ever yet seen that I should continue to be a Whig. Many have changed among whom are Kepler and Turner and Bates etc. We thought it was best for us to leave Washington, lest we should be considered an Office seeker, a most despisable idea among the more respectable. If they give me an office soon I may accept of it, but I do not intend to make application any further than to wait upon their word of promise. Bro. Slicer has been very sick with inflamitory Rheumatism. Dr. Davis has also had a spell of it, and is just recovering from it. The rest of us are well. By the goodness of the Lord, in whose mercy we trust, we are trying to do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with Him. We attended one of the most delightful Love feasts at Exeter meeting last night. Old Aunty Brown was there and spoke with her usual good feeling. We hope you are all well. Kate will be married on Tuesday next. She will have no wedding except a few witnesses. She will be married by a German Reformed preacher, her pastor. Our love to Ellen &amp; the family. Truly M. G. H. (From M. G. Hamilton)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg Va.Apl 18 Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Va. Leesburg April 15th 1853 My dear son Francis In my letter lately written to Edward I requested him to say to you that I would shortly write to you, and now I have only to say among other things that your remissness in your correspondence with home, presents itself first, &amp; consequently the disposition here to complain on that score is natural. I got your letter from Alexandria by sending after it, (the one containing Dr. H's introduction to Judge Field). I ought to have rec.d that on my way up to Culpeper. I have just written to Dr. P? C. Slaughter of Cul. who kindly offered to convey to me intelligence in relation to several Estates which were expected to come into market soon. I find in the Nat. Intel. a farm offered for sale lying 8 miles below Warrenton, which is of good size, but I suppose it is situated rather low down in the red lands. I did intend however going to look at it, &amp; may do so next week. It belongs to Temple M. Washington, when I may also extend my ride along the Manassas R. R.d up where are other farms to look ar. If I could sell out in Loudon I should have little hesitation to go farther south, but I should dislike sacrificing my property here. Yet even this should not deter me if I could find a suitable location in all respects, especially as the step would be so gratifying to my children, whose pleasure &amp; happiness I wish to promote &amp; for which I do cheerfully labour. In a late letter from Edward to his Ma he alluded to a subject which has caused a stirring interest in the family,—the prospect of your promotion to a professorship, with strict injunctions however to keep silent for the present, inasmuch as there must be uncertainty in the matter. I wish you would yourself write me your views upon the prospect. Such an acquisition would be a subject of delight &amp; rejoicing here &amp; would confer high honor upon all the connexion. You are worthy of it, my son, aspire to it. You are a native Virginian, Virginia delights to honor her virtuous sons. I pray God it may be so. What a load of gratitude it would add to all my other obligations to my Heavenly Father who has been so good to me. All of your wishes shall be complied with in regard to the silver ware. Any hint from you as to the assortment desirable would aid in making the selection. Your hint about the "ware" presupposes some other interesting advent. Can't you communicate something more definite? We are enjoying usual health, for which Blessing from God we try ever to be thankful to Him. I ought however to say that I have had a new touch of Rhumatism in the knee &amp; am a little lame with some other slight indications of approaching age, but we try to be content &amp; happy, referring all of our interests to a kind Providence. May the Good Lord bless you abundantly. This is my daily prayer. Yrs. affectionately D. G. Smith P. S. I will give you a little statement here of our business. Our store is very much neglected of course. We are not doing much. Goshen has the past year paid me over $1500 Leedswood (wheat crop short) about 1000 Broad Run over 500 I have now on Leedswood 46 head of large cattle which cost me 1150$. Some smaller cattle &amp; some 80 large in partnership. Have but few cattle on Goshen &amp; B.d Run, owing to the high price last fall. We are however gathering a few along.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore Apl 25 1853 Dear Bro. Smith We received yours of the 12th in good time, and we would have acknowledged it sooner, but we have been very busy doing nothing. We are thankful for your condolence in our turned out condition. Dont you feel sorry? Well you perceive the Whigs must all share the same fate. Kepler, Michel and Lumsdon and many others have been turned out. Now aint I sorry? Yes I am that. But then there is just as much room out of Washington as in it, and I dont see the use of grieveing about it. Since we came home we have had quite a wedding. Miss Mary Kate has taken a rib. She was married last Tuesday. She had a few friends to witness the ceremony, not being able to have much of a wedding on account of her Father being so poorly. Our E. R. went to school this morning for the first time. We hope to see you soon. Bro. Slicer has been very sick with an attack of inflamatory rheumatism, and therefore has not been able to get me a place in the new Administration. I do not think they will keep Whigs in after the 1st of July. But he seems to think I must have a place, and I leave the matter in his hands. He is a very influential Democrat, and if he can get me a place I shall not object. By the blessing of providence we enjoy good health. Eliza is tolerable for her. She seems to be very thin, and I think she needs a visit to Leesburg to put some flesh on her frame. How would it do for us to come up and spend the summer? What would you charge for board for three? I suppose you will soon have a Rail Road along up the town branch, and then you msut have one to the Pt. of Rocks. I have no news to give you. E. sends her love to Ellen etc., and E. R sends hers also, and I send mine. Write soon. Farewell M. G. Hamilton Love to Bro. Rodgers family.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University April 29th, 1853 My dearest Mary I have just time enough this morning to send you two or three lines. I intended to write last night, but went to sleep over some natural philosophy, and did not wake until it was high time to retire. So I determined to rise this morning rather earlier than usual, in order to execute what was deferred. Sure enough my eyes popped open about 6 o'c., but my feelings were as usual, "a little more slumber": and I think that nothing less than my love for you, and desire to provoke you to good works ( i.e. to write to your deserted &amp; disconsolate admirer) could have furnished a motive sufficient to dispel the shackles of that siren, a morning doze. My love, this circumstance sets me to moralizing upon the tendency to procrastinate present duties, which has been growing upon me of late. I am afraid I shall never achieve any of the great objects of life, if I permit such a spirit to take possession of me. Can my dear little Mentor suggest a remedy? When you went away on Monday, I thought that I could bear the long separation with commendable firmness, -that I would not begin to repine for a week or so at least, and therefore I did not, as you saw, give evidence of any overpowering sorrow-although I did feel inwardly moved at parting from you. Would you believe it? I have been wandering about for a day or so, like one who has lost something, he doesnt know what or where. I come to my room, but cant content myself here. I step over to your house-but it seems so deserted in your absence, that I cant rest there long. So I glide about like a wandering ghost. When 5 o'clock comes, I feel that I have nobody to walk with. When I have an odd hour or so, I have nobody to spend it with. It is these innumerable small bonds which render my attachment to you too strong to be easily or hastily destroyed. I thought (although you did not have the unkindness to suggest it this time) that I would do wonders in the way of studying while you are away, but I find that when you are here, I cant resist the temptation to step over to talk with you, and when you are away, my thoughts are fixed on you, &amp; a feeling of loneliness hangs about me, so that in either case, books are thrown aside. I shall never do anything, until you marry me. Perhaps when you are my wife, and never away from me, I shall do something. Is this the suggestion of my evil genius Procrastination? Mr. Holcombe invited me to a large party at his house on Wednesday night, and I promised him to go. I thought I would have a budget of news to tell you-but I learned that it was to be a dancing party—that the fiddlers were engaged etc. So although my own sentiments are not decidedly adverse to such amusements, I determined after taking thought, in deference to your own &amp; your pa's opinions &amp; the rule of the church, not to go. Mr. Gholson told me they danced from 9 until 4 o'c. Miss Southall, Miss Pleasants, Miss Gamble etc. were there. The college ladies were invited &amp; not knowing the character of the party, Miss McGuffey was going, but on learning at a late hour that preparations had been extensively made for dancing, she abandoned her design. Your ma is not pleased that they concealed the fact of the dancing &amp; invited members of the church. Madame Bishop is certainly to be here on Friday, May 6th. You will miss the pleasure of hearing her. Will you permit me to gallant some pretty lady to the concert? Mrs. Le Chaud (how do you spell her name?) has been taken ill within a few days, and is now lying dangerously sick. I hope you are enjoying yourself finely-which is equivalent to wishing you plenty of work-as I believe you enjoy nothing but fatigue. Cant you write to me, my dearest? Oceans of love to you. God bless you. Your own Frank (Francis H. Smith to Mary Stuart Harrison)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Sherwood May 1st 1853 My own dear Frank I have been thinking of you so much to-day, that I cannot resist the inclination I feel to communicate with you in some way. I hope my dear that I am not doing wrong in thus yielding to my wishes on the sab bath day, of speaking some few words of love to one who has become to me a second and a better self. I cannot tell you all the feelings of love to you with which my heart has been swelling to-day, and with what j oy I have b een reflecting upon the strength of our mutual affection. How grateful I feel to our Heavenly Father for giving me unworthy as I am the ardent affection of such a heart, and one to lean upon so trustingly. Oh! my dear Frank, I do want to make you an obedient gentle wife, to know no other earthly will but your's, but such is the stubbornness and pride of my heart, that although such are ny feelings now and whenever thinking calmly. I cannot conceal from myself that many occasions and seasons must occur to put these right desires to the test, and many must be my failures in duty unless supported by grace from on high, and to this end I trust that your prayers will ascend with mine often and earnestly. You know dearest I have often felt misgivings and even repugnance to entering upon the marriage relation, but now that the time is drawing near when we shall be indissolubly united, I am so thankful that my feelings have undergone a change. I now yield myself with such readiness, yea with what joy to my husband's arms, and feel myself so unutterably blessed by his love. I have not one lingering fear now, but I long to be yours, wholly yours, my own kind love. And as day by day I feel more sensibly how exactly the wants of our natures are supplied, by this reciprocal love, so graciously implanted in our bosoms by our Heavenly Father, I feel that I cannot sufficiently bless God for his great goodness. And what reason it gives us to trust him for the future happiness of our immortal spirits, when our temporal interests are so kindly cared for. Yes! my dear Frank, when feelings of gushing tenderness for one another cause our bosoms to throb with joy, let us sanctify the Lord God in our hearts and give him the praise, thus ennobling and elevating, at the same time that we inhance mere earthly enjoyments by making them the occasion of magnifying the Lord our God. My dearest love I hope that I am not wearying you, and that it is not wrong to speak thus candidly the sentiments of my heart. I daresay it is not prudent to commit such thoughts to paper, but then I know whom I am confiding in, and that no eye but that for which it is intended will ever read these words. We are so much together my dear love that we are scarcely conscious until separated of the strength of our attachment, and indeed Frank you ought never to doubt the depth of my love, for at times when scarce conscious of the existence of ought but every day ordinary affections there comes up such an upwelling outgushing of intense feelings from the fountain of my soul, as when a tiny rivulet swollen by heavy rains becomes a mighty dashing torrent, sweeping all before it, so my whole being seems absorbed by one emotion. Love love love. Let us be swallowed up in love! but pure love, holy love, to the Creator first and creature next. God help us both to love purely and fervently, and may our earthly union sweet and endearing though it be being only the type of a more lasting more perfect one with our blessed Saviour above, animate us to renewed diligence in seeking to make our calling &amp; election sure. How many internal evidences we have of the truth of our holy religion in seeing how delicately adapted is the nature of the creature to the will of the Creator. I love my Frank so dearly, so devotedly, that were I a poor deluded Roman seeking to gain Heaven by self denial and good works (rather say hard works) I could certainly prove my sincerity in seeking my soul's salvation by throwing myself into a convent. I daresay such would have been my fate, had I been so situated, for I am by nature rather inclined to such things, but how different the teaching of the Bible, the word of inspiration says "Wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord. For the husband is head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, and he is the Saviour of the body. Then how safely I can indulge the natural affections of my heart, with such words in my mind, and dearest whether a triumph of human love or divine grace I know not, both I trust, even my proud unbending heart feels there is a sweetness, a fitness in the command to reverence &amp; obey one's husband, and it will be a welcome day to me when Frank cam claim such obedience from me as his wedded wife. I hope you will excuse all that is amiss in this letter my own true love, for the warmth of my affection must make my excuse, and I should not think such a plea could be made in vain to a lover. There are so many instances of forbearance and patience on your part towards me when wayward and fretful, that I cannot help feeling thankful for having experienced such demonstrations of regard from you, at the same time that it fills me with humility. I trust that by the grace and help of God, I may hereafter be of a more meek &amp; gentle spirit. Pray for me dearest. Ever your's in tenderest love Mary Stuart Harrison My dear Frank please don't laugh at me too much and tease me about what I have said in this letter. Affec yours M.S.H.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Univ. May 2d 1853 My sweet girl You can't tell how much joy your letter gave me. Expected blessings are as pleasant frequently as unexpected. I have read &amp; reread it. You seem to have written with the remark in view, which you mentioned to me some time since, as being made by a certain lady "that she wrote nothing in her letters etc etc". So to console myself, I tumbled over my papers &amp; got out the "warm letter" of la last summer. You don't know how heartily I blessed you, my dear, for your confidence and affection, &amp; I believe you have the same depth of love now-though you dont express the same "desiderium". The reading of two or three of those former missives quite reconciled me to the business letter rec.d yesterday. Don't think that I am so selfish as not to take the deepest interest in the least thing you write. I assure you every line is dear to me. Write anything &amp; everything you please. I would prefer always having a transcript of your feelings at the moment-to any expression made with a view of pleasing me. The flowers were so acceptable-more so than a costlier present—their sweet perfume reminding me of the gentle &amp; blessed influences of your own happy nature &amp; consistent Christian conduct-their pure white, symbolizing the virgin purity &amp; grace of the dear girl who sent them. Don't work too hard. I don't marry you for your clothes. I should be happy to take you in the "old red" &amp; nothing else. By the way (dont tell) Mrs. Broadus unintentionally let Miss Hill know you went away to work. I have been citting around among the girls lately at a great rate-walking on the terrace with one unmarried pretty girl &amp; also rising at 5¼ to go to Fry's spring in her company,-diked up now to go to town to visit another. You had better come home, old lady, &amp; see to your property, if you expect to find it where you left it. Some men have formed acquaintances courted &amp; been married in less than 3 weeks. You were invited to Mr. Holcombe's the other night. Only 4 ladies danced. I understand. I wish you would find out, if opportunity offers, Mr. Stev enson's views in regard to the appointment, &amp; also what Mr Rives grounds for his opinion of Mr. Cabell's pre-commitment are. Any thing you can find out by noting what is said in your presence, wi will interest me greatly. Your views of the impropriety of making court to Mr. Stevenson are remarkably just for so small a girl. I wrote to my daddy by this mail telling him among other things that we might be married in July. Mr. Dabney is convalescent. While very ill one day, he said to Jim Cochrane "how ugly you are". Jim immediately remarked to Dr. Cabell that Dabney must be in the woldest delirium. I am very much in want of your presence, my love. I must see you this week, if possible. I shall, if well, be with you on Saturday-Providence permitting. Owing to a change in your Ma's plan of sending her letter. I have been obliged to write at race horse speed. Write to me, my dearest. You have for your well-being in every respect the ardent prayers of your lover F. H. S. Take care of the green mountain beaux. They think that you reciprocate their love-Do you? Ah no. tis pity, tis not love you feel.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Univ. of Virginia May 2. 1853 My dear Mary Jane, I received your letter Saturday, and although you had not any very cheering news to give about our dear Mother's health, yet it was much to have some definite information. For want of this we had become very anxious. It seems to me hardly reasonable to expect that she should be able to endure a great while longer such continued &amp; severe sufferings. I am truly thankful that she has been so far sustained as to bear them with patience, and, if our Heavenly Father please to send affliction, &amp; accompanies it with grace to bear it resignedly, we ought to be thankful. Do encourage her to cast herself with perfect confidence on the all sufficient atonement of our blessed Redeemer, and, remembering that he ever lives above to make intercession for us, to ask Him nothing doubting, to bestow more and more of the comforts of his grace, so that she may rejoice in tribulation also. How willing is He to give! —more willing than are parents to bestow good things on their children. I know how apt dear Mother is to be despondent—but God can give strength to the humble &amp; believing heart. He will not forsake those that put their trust in Him; but with sorry trial will give grace to bear it. I am not able to leave home, else how gladly would I make haste to be with her. But if I cannot be with her, I want to know that she is happy in the love of the Savior. We have had some sickness in our family, besides my own attack, from which I am nearly recovered. Flora was taken very ill friday, having violent epileptic convulsions. These lasted all friday night, &amp; until saturday night, about 9 o'clock, when she began to be better. About noon saturday I almost gave up all hope of her recovery. I think now that she may survive this attack, although she is still ailing. Rosalie &amp; Charlotte are having the measles; but thus far quite mildly. We have a number yet to have them. Eliza expected to visit Maria Rives for a few days this week, but is prevented. She wishes to be with Mrs. McGuffey in her approaching sickness-for this &amp; other reasons, she cannot leave home. Had you heard that Mrs. Courtenay has twins? two boys—to be named Marshall &amp; Hamilton. I am not surprized at William Stevens consenting to become a candidate again—although I very much doubt if he is consulting either his interest or his comfort. I cannot understand how a man having a family can willingly consent to become a politician. But I have more than most men a dislike for public life. The family unite with me in love to Mother &amp; the rest. I saw Mr. Rodes today—his family was well. Yr. brother affectionately, Gessner Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Mary Jane HarrisonHarrisonburg Virginia University May 4th 1853 My dear Mary Jane, I have been wishing for some time to write to you, but as usual have been very much occupied and Dr. Harrison generally anticipated me. I was deeply concerned to hear that our dear Mother continued in so feeble a state. I had hoped that as the weather became milder she would improve, and once more be restored to her usual health; I often think how great a gratification it would be to me to be with her, but it seems that I am pretty much confined. We have unusual difficulties in our domestic affairs. Flora was taken very ill Friday last. During the night she was seized with violent convulsions, which have resulted in the premature birth of a child, born dead. I hope she will now get well though it may be some time before she can do any thing, if she ever is of any service again. In the mean time we find it quite difficult to obtain any one to take her place. Rosalie has nearly recovered from the measles. I never saw so mild a kind. She has not been the least sick. I hope the other members who are to have it, will be equally fortunate. Poor Mrs. McKennie has recently lost her mother. She sied at Mrs. Nelsons of pneumonia. I do not know whether Mrs. McKennie has returned yet. I feel very much for her, she must have arrived only to see her mother a very short while before her death. Mrs. Leschot is now ill with the same disease. There is but little hope of her recovery. Eugene Davis has a son very ill from the measles. It is not thought he can possibly recover. Mrs. Dr. Davis is getting well rapidly. She thinks of going to Lynchburg as soon as she is well enough to travel. Mrs. Courtenay had twins Sunday week. She calls them after her two brothers, Marshall and Hamilton. They are very diminutive little creatures. She is looking badly. She has been a good deal afflicted with asthma lately. She has an excellent nurse from Baltimore, besides one here. It takes them all to give the requisite attention. Sister Maria paid me a visit recently of a week. Mary returned with her and proposes remaining three weeks, that she might go on with her work uninterruptedly. She says she is making but slow progress. A very particular friend of ours Mrs. Blair Dabney of Campbell, has been in Charlottesville to see her son, who was ill, but is now recovering. Sister M. sent in her carriage for her and me to-day, but unfortunately I could not go. I greatly regretted this, as she is a very old and particular friend of our Mother's as well as our own. I promised myself much enjoyment in her society. I was greatly shocked and concerned to hear of Mrs. Gen'l Lewis' death. I had not even heard of her illness. How sadly the poor Lomax family have been afflicted. Surely there must be some wise purpose in this afflicting the good and excellent of earth. How dark these dispensations of Providence would seem, if not looked at with the eye of faith. Maria is very busy preparing to go to housekeeping, which they intend doing in August. Mr. Broadus has rented a house at the town end of Main Street, not very far from the Depot. They will procure some furniture from Dr. Smith on very advantageous terms. The new Baptist Church is begun, the members had a feast, &amp; some fancy articles to dispose of in aid of it last night. They propose having it three days. Our garden is looking very well. Our flowers are beginning to bloom abundantly, and the vegetables promise well. I have rarely had so fine a crop of peas. The locust trees are in full bloom, the whole air is filled with perfume. We have had an unusually mild spring, not a single frost that I recollect. I hope we shall have a plenty of strawberries. Last Saturday and Sunday we had quarterly meeting. Mr. Moorman was here and preached Sunday last. Maria joined the church Saturday. Dr. Harrison is pretty well again, though he has been very much fatigued and has lost a great deal of rest. I hope he may be able to get through his laborious duties without farther hindrance. All the family unite with me in sending much love to Mother, Mary, Caroline &amp; Fannie &amp; yourself, and a kiss for Minna. Our love also to aunt Baxter. I wish most sincerely she and Mother could not be separated. Ever your affectionate sister E. H.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Mary Stuart Harrison(Care of Geo. Rives, Esq.) Carter's Bridge P.O. Va. University of Virginia May 6th 1853 My dearest Mary You will see how imprudent you were to be so liberal as to write me two letters for one, at the beginning of this week-thereby giving some ground for expecting at least one in answer to each letter. `Consekence vas' as Mr. Weller wd say, that I might have been seen on yesterday, mournfully retracing my steps from the P. O. after a vain inquiry for an epistle. I can't forbear sending you a few words of greeting this morning, and I feel that I am in this only sympathizing with the scores of amorous birds who are giving their sweethearts a gay morning serenade upon the trees all around me. You ought to see how prettily the locusts on the lawn have put forth their blossoms. They with their fragrance. You find a more beautiful spot at present. It seems to me that there is more singing of birds this spring than usual. I have a complete orchestra now back of my window. Perhaps it is not so much an increase of singers as an increased disposition to hear them, due to a fellow-feeling, which perhaps makes us wondrous attentive as well as kind. There is one feeling of regret crossing my mind at this moment-that these merry lovers will all be married, settled &amp; have a house full of pretty pledges, before I, poor devil, shall be taking the initiatory steps. How we might envy the birds! What cares the little fellow on the bush there about Dr. Worsham or a Professorship? He would snap his fingers at both. He &amp; his wife have no difficulty about a house, they build one for themselves. What care they about getting Uncle Jaok? To be sure, he does not trouble himself much about Mary Harrison, but that only shows his want of taste. He gives me a lesson in one thing, I have no doubt that he pays the strictest attention to his mate's performance in a musical way, always applauding most vigorously and never critising, or calling to notice a false trill or I must imitate him. Again, more Him no anxiety for the provision in the future. The fields of the earth lie before him. He is one of God's freemen, and acts as though he were conscious of the fact, that his Father's eye is ever on him. No consciousness of guilt oppresses his heart. No lashes of conscience lacerate his bosom, therefore no tears ever dim his eyes. A life full of melody, spent in giving sweet pleasure to others, rejoicing the strong, comforting the sick &amp; despond.t by his glad song. Has not Christ taught us from this? "Behold the fowls of the air; for they sow not, neither do they reap. Your Heavenly Father feedeth them-take therefore no (anxious) thought for the morrow." But why take the consolation afforded here, unless I comply with the remainder of the injunction "Seek first the Kingdom of God." My dear precious girl-I am glad that one occasion of anxiety has been removed. I am assured that Dr. Cabell pronounced that there was no authority for saying that his uncle was pledged. On the contrary, his uncle had written to him, expressing his satisfaction that the University could furnish a candidate who could be recommended. I trust, yea pray, that I may soon be in a situation to take to my bosom my darling Mary, as my wedded wife. I look forward to that time, if God spares me, as an era in my religious as well as social life. This is the chief labor to get this appointment. ities and fatigues to be desired Time, which reveals all things, will soon decide this. Rosalie is running about quite well. Flora is, I believe, or was yesterday, still very sick. I havn't heard from Mrs. Leschot I don't know that I will go to hear Mad. Bishop tonight. I have been walking to Fry's spring of late. You must be my companion when you return. I am so thankful that your health is better than it was last year. You may expect me to-morrow about 12 o'clock. God bless you, my better self Frank (Torn for stamp)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paid 3 Miss Mary Stuart Harrison(care Geo Rives Esq) Carter's Bridge P.O. Va. University of Virginia May 13th/53 My dear Mary I feel like doing any thing but writing this morning, but I can't omit an opportunity of holding communion with you. I told you in my last that I was not very well. I felt worse yesterday &amp; last evening I consulted Dr. Cabell, who ordered me to bathe my feet in hot water &amp; take some Dover's powders. This I did, and this morning, although I feel weak and feverish, yet I have not the soreness on my breast which distressed me yesterday morning, and I trust I am much better. I shall not go out today. I perspired profusely during the whole of last night. Don't give yourself any uneasiness on my account. If I do not get better, you shall hear of it. I am sorry you are away, for your presence, or the knowledge that you are near me, is a great relief to me when I am unwell. Your dear letter gave me renewed proof that I am not forgotten where of all places in the world I most desire to be remembered. If at times I have indulged a faint suspicion that I was more lightly thought of than I wished to be, your conduct towards me, &amp; your letters to me, during the past year &amp; especially during the past month have proved that it was unfounded. And to tell the truth I am not certain, that I ever really &amp; truly doubted that you loved me. I hope you will never doubt my affection for you. I assure you that I love you, as I would love my wedded wife. Prayffor me constantly Mary. I need much prayer both of my own &amp; of others. I remember you with joy at a throne of grace. Dr. Cabell has just been into my room &amp; thinks I can be out tomorrow. My Father has bought me a handsome trunk &amp; set of silver which awaits my pleasure. I feel too weak to write more. Remember me earnestly in your prayers. God bless you, my own dearest Mary. Your lover F. H. Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia My dear Frank, It was very kind in you to write to me, when you felt so badly, and I thank you for it. It makes me feel low spirited to think of your being sick while I am away, especially as I shall not be able to hear from you again until Monday. I cannot help feeling somewhat uneasy meanwhile. Your father is very kind to you, I did not think it worth while to send his letter to you by mail, but will keep it carefully till I get home. I am surprized to hear of your brother Edward's being in love. It seems to me there must be some mistake about it or one of us would have heard something of it. Who can the lady be? Maria will tell you what my arrangements for getting home will be. I am ashamed of myself Frank for being so inconsiderate as to dream of asking you to come for me. I do not know how I could ever have done such a thing, but then I am such a very very silly little girl that I ought not to be surprized at my doing anything however thoughtless. Aunt Maria says it would be entirely out of the question, and so it would, please dont think of it on any account. Many thanks to you for the magazine, it has afforded me much pleasure, and I feel very grateful to you for thinking of it. I have actually cut a wisdom tooth, am I not getting old at a rapid rate? Mrs. Stevenson called Wednesday morning, and Aunt Maria intends taking me next week to return the visit. I wish you could have been here to see her. I cannot help feeling very sanguine now as to your success, indeed it seems to me almost certain, but then it is not right to be too sure. I do pray for you constantly my dear Frank, and feel happy in thinking you do the same for me. Of late especially I have been entirely too much engrossed in worldly things. Oh how hard it is to live loose to this world, and keep eternity in view. God help us both to be prepared for the issues of life and death, and keep us from the evil that is in this world. I shall await Monday's mail with anxiety, time will seem long till I hear again. Ever yours M. S. H. (Mary Stuart Harrison to Francis H. Smith)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. May 16 1853 Dear Br. Smith Yours of the 10th came safe to hand containing a draft for $44.39 and a statement of fence Bill etc. We hereby return thanks for the same. I called at Mr. Kirks and he says he will take the knives back, if not injured, with pleasure. He seems disposed to be very accomodating, and says he will sell you spoons or any thing in his line on as satisfactory terms as you can get them any where, and would be pleased to supply you according to order, subject to being returned if not suitable. I also looked at Divans at several of the furniture stores and find the price to be from 30 to 40 dollars a pair, such as you describe. Some how they seem to be high in comparison with other articles of furniture. Mr. Kirk says he will send you the price of the articles, but you can judge better by those you purchased. We feel thankful to our Heavenly Father for the continued blessing of health and happiness. The Dr. is improving since you were here, and we hope he will soon be recovered and be able to get about soon. I preached yesterday morning for Dr. Heiner (German Reformed) and my employment at present seems to be, to preach once on Sabbath, and meet classes during the week, and if we could live without money I would like my employment much, but you know a little occasionally is very needful. Don't you think you and Bro. Rodgers could employ me at a clever salery, like Bro. Guest is employed in Alex.a, as a Leesburg missionary? And to be a little more serious. Give our love to Ellen and the family, to Bro. R. and his, to the Misses Binns and all our friends and believe me Most truly etc M. G. Hamilton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sherwood May 17th 1853 My dear Frank I received your letter yesterday evening after anxiously waiting it all day. This morning whether from sleepiness or innocence I scarcely know, I feel no disposition to enter into a defence of myself against the charges of inconsistency etc. brought against me, but if you will pardon me prefer to leave all that until we meet. If the weather is good you may expect me about the middle of the day Saturday. Aunt Maria intends to come back home the same day, and I hope I need not say that I shall be delighted to be with you again, although you seem to think I have all of a sudden grown cold &amp; indifferent. I am sorry to learn that you are not yet perfectly recovered. I hope you will be very careful not to expose yourself in any way, for if there is anything I dread it is your being sick, especially when disease is so prevalent as at present. Have you heard anything of Miss Jane Randolph lately? I was concerned to hear from Redlands Sunday that she was very sick indeed, in Baltimore, if it is so her recovery must be very doubtful. I feel a great deal for Mr. Kean, it must make him very unhappy. Miss Ellen Randolph was at Redlands, but they would not let her know how her sister was, for fear of distressing her while on a visit. I am also sorry to hear that Mrs. Courtenay is so dangerously sick. Mrs. Cristopher Gilmer spent the day here yesterday so you see we have visitors. although in the country, and either to-day or to-morrow we will go out ourselves. Sunday we went to Temple Hill and heard a sermon from Mr. Doll. It was communion day, but I felt so sick and badly that we came away as soon as the congregation was dismissed. You must not think I am voluntarily injuring my eyes&amp; My health in any way. I am only anxious to do as much work here as possible because I know how little can be done at home, and I do not think it is because my heart is so set upon the clothes. I know that certain things must be done, and I only wish to do my portion of the labour, not surely because I enjoy such constant employment, but look forward I assure you with great joy to the time when it will be terminated. Please excuse my miserable writing. I am ashamed to send you such letters as I do. I do not think I will be able to write again before I go home, but I hope I shall hear from you. You have been very kind to write to me so regularly. With a great deal of love, Your truly attached Mary (Mary Stuart Harrison to Francis H. Smith)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia May 22. 1853 My dear Mother, As the Session draws towards its close my labors necessarily become even more severe, leaving me hardly the time for necessary rest. I am thus deprived not only of the opportunity of visiting you in your long continued and painful affliction, but even of that of writing to you. You must not imagine that I would willingly omit doing any thing I can do that would contribute to your comfort or happiness; but believe that I am constrained by circumstances which I cannot well control. I am thankful that thus far the present session, amid so much sickness in the community, my own health has been pretty good, excepting a slight attack that confined me to my room for a week. To complete the labors of the Session it will demand all my strength &amp; energy, even should my health be preserved. Edward has had a pretty sharp attack of the measles, but is now recovering fairly. Only Bob &amp; one of the negro children remain to have the measles. It is doubtful if Eliza Broadus has had them. She had no eruption, although she had some of the symptoms. I presume that you may have heard of poor Mrs. Courtenay's death. She had not recovered from her confinement-became very much worse Saturday &amp; Sunday, and died Monday. She leaves behind her Five little children. I presume, from what I have heard, that she had hardly any expectation of such an issue. The family had not expected it until Monday. Dr. Howard himself was hoping for her recovery until Monday morning. Our community was very greatly shocked by the unexpected and melancholy result. We ought to make this a solemn warning to be ready for the coming of the messenger of death. The only way of safety is to be always ready. This we may be, if we make Christ our timely refuge. I trust you have more bodily comfort, and that you are steadily and hourly reposing yourself on the all sufficient atonement of Christ-and that you have comfort in believing. Let not go your confidence, but implicitly believe God's promises of grace &amp; mercy, always remembering that we are saved through the great goodness &amp; mercy of God in Christ Jesus. Properly speaking our faith has no merit-we are by it enabled to receive the benefits of Christ's death &amp; atonement-but it is the free gift of God through Christ that we are saved. William Stevens mentioned in a note I had from him two or three days ago, that the rest of the family were pretty well. Please give them my love, &amp; believe me, Yr. son affectinately, Gessner Harrison Flora, who has been very ill, is slowly recovering, although she has not been so well today. At one time I had no hope of her recovery. Why does not Caroline sometimes write? I am always anxious to hear from you, and Mary Jane has not the opportunity to write as frequently as I could wish.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Richmond, Va.May 27 3 paid Miss Mary HarrisonUniversity of VirginiaCare of Dr. Harrison Richmond May 25 /53 Dear Mary Will you forgive me for not writing before this, I can plead no excuse except laziness. I have often thought of you, &amp; your dear family, &amp; shall always remember my visit to the University, with peculiar pleasure. The pleasant walks &amp; conversations we have had together, I can never forget. Although we were only a few days with each other, I formed attachments for you &amp; yours, which nothing can break. Now Mary did you not promise to come &amp; see me. I dont intend to let you off, but tease you to death untill you say "Yes". Vacation will soon be here &amp; then Mary you must come I will take no excuse. I hope Charlie is well before this. Richmond is very dull. My Sister has returned &amp; I feel more at home. I saw Miss Yancey about three weeks ago, she was looking very well. Pa, Ma, and all join me in urging you to come. Pa unites with me in sending best love to your dear family. My kindest regards to your brothers, &amp; Mr. Gibbons &amp; now dear Mary I must close. May you ever be blessed is the prayer of your fondly attached friend Julia C. Langhorne P. S. Please burn this as soon as read &amp; do not let any one see such a miserable scratch. J. C. L.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philadelphia, May 29, 1853 My dear Maria, I believe that I have now been as long in replying to your last letter, as you were in answering mine, but probably a want of something worth communicating has been the principal cause of the tardiness in both cases. Still the intercourse ought to be kept up, and at all events it is something to learn the state of our own health &amp; that of our families. I was glad to hear from Dr. Schele, who made a hasty visit to this place to give testimony in behalf of a young Belgian here under trial, that Mary Harrison had been passing some weeks with you, to the manifest benefit of her health. I presume that if Smith is elected Wm. Rogers's successor, she will be married soon—and even if that does not take place, though we have as yet received no hint to that effect. In a late trip to Baltimore I went over to Washington, &amp; there saw Mrs. Henry Tucker at Beverley's. She looks much older, but has her wonted spirits. Beverly has been for some time a candidate for the place of Marshall—and has many friends in the cabinet—but as the emoluments of the place are very large, he has some formidable competitors. Her sons David, Randolph, &amp; St. George are all prospering in their pursuits. Alfred is studying closely for the ministry—Tudor is doing nothing at this time. The Emmets have returned from Bermuda, where they were very cordially received &amp; entertained. I presume that the carpenters are now at work with you, &amp; consequently afford you a subject both of interest &amp; amusement. We are now looking for the arrival of Wm. Rives &amp; his family from France, but hear that they do not mean to stop in Philadelphia. We shall set out for Bedford Springs in less than four weeks from this time, &amp; return through the valley to Albemarle. Your mother's health is much improved. I was much pleased to hear of your favorable accounts of Tucker's improvement. You must endeavour to guard against his falling back when he returns home. I fear you will miss your friend Mrs. LeSchot, in selecting matters of taste at least. Joseph Wilmer's health has been of late so bad that he has not preached for months. There has been a singular epidemic here—the breaking out of carbuncles—&amp; the clergy have had their full share of it. He &amp; his family are going to pass the summer in Albemarle in the neighbourhood of their relations-the Coles's—but as their family is now large, they insist on keeping house if one can be obtained. Your mother sends you her love &amp; joins me in regard-to Mr. Rives &amp; the children I am Your ever affectionate father George Tucker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sherwood, June 4th 1853 My dear Husband I feel quite impatient to see you again although I do not suffer so much from loneliness as when you were in Baltimore, as Mama sleeps in the same room with me and I am in company all day. We got here in good time for dinner Wednesday and have been getting on very well so far, notwithstanding the trouble Eliza gives me for she does trouble me not a little. She has a hard cry every time she leaves me to go to Emma, who has been nursing her a good deal, but it is not the same thing as when Martha is with me to take the entire burden from me. Thursday I went to the Green Mountain Church and heard the first sermon before the Convocation, preached by Mr. Meade. As none of the people had come prepared to stay, there was no second service, but yesterday we went and stayed all day. Mr. Ernest preached in the morning what would have been an excellent sermon without the notes, but his appeals to the sinner and the ungodly fell rather flat on the ear, read from the paper before him. What a difference it does make surely! Please don't ever think for a moment of abandoning your present mode for any other. Reading won't answer, I am certain. Mr. Boyden in the afternoon gave us a discourse or rather a reading upon Heaven and its delights to the righteous, which seemed to me very tame. This morning Mr. Slack is to hold forth and this afternoon Mr. Meade. Whether rightly or not I cannot tell, but I have concluded to stay at home to-day. I thought two days out of the three would do for me, as I take but little interest and find but little profit, besides having a great deal of work to do and its being very fatiguing to stay in Church such a length of time on a very hot day. In justice to myself I must say however that none of these excuses would keep me away if I considered it my duty to go, if it were either my church or yours that was holding the meeting. Mama counted 28 people at the afternoon service yesterday!! I am anxious to hear how you succeeded and hope you found time to write. Mama heard from home yesterday and that made me feel still more anxious for my letter to come. Poor Mr. Courtenay he has his lot of affliction surely, but under the circumstances the death of the little children can hardly be regarded otherwise than as a merciful providence. I suppose by the time you get this letter, Bob will be almost over the Measles. Papa wrote that he was completely covered with the eruption &amp; doing very well. I am afraid Mary has had a hard time nursing him, as he seemed very much opposed to staying in the house the day we came away. I think you may expect us certainly to dinner Wednesday as Mama is anxious to go then and I shall not interpose the slightest objection. Aunt Maria said she expected to stay till Friday or Saturday, but I think she will let us go without making it seem like treating her badly. When I mentioned my having a great deal of work to do and little time to do it in, she said she intended to give me some help in preparing and that I must send out some work. A kind offer, but I must say I am not fond of receiving help where I have no way of returning the favor. Tell me what you think of it. George Rives came home yesterday and Dr. Bramham arrived while we were at Church, so that we are at no loss for society. However I shall not be sorry to be at home again with nobody but Lida &amp; Pa, for I don't see any people who are as interesting in my eyes. I rise very early in the morning but have not been able to do much work as yet, Lida and church have occupied nearly all the time. Next week Aunt Maria talks of taking me to return the visit Mrs. Moon paid me when I was here summer before last, and I reckon it would not amiss in me to ask for Miss Sanford too. She might like to see the wife of one whom she loves and admires and I should like to see her, especially as she might feel hurt if I should not make any inquiry about her. I am sorry there is to be no preaching Sunday as I dislike to have to stay at home all day with only nursing as an occupation. Another thing that I am sorry for is that I forgot to bring any stamps &amp; will have to charge the letter to Aunt Maria I reckon, as she says I must and does not keep stamps. I might read a good deal more than I do if Lida would sleep in the morning, but she wakes up almost as soon as I do and of course I can do but little at that hour of the day or indeed any other as long as Martha is sick. Papa wrote that he had not seen her but believed she was better. I hope indeed she will be well when I get back. I wish I could write more and better, but I feel quite destitute of ideas this morning and shall have to stop. With love to all the family in which Mama and Aunt Maria unite I am your affectionate wife Maria C. Broadus P.S. If you feel at a loss for something to occupy you till my return it would be doing me a favor to inquire of Mr. Foster the price of white powdered sugar and brown sugar of different qualities. I shall want some of both kinds for preserving before long. White loaf sugar also. I must stop though. Good-by— little husband. Lida would send a kiss if she were awake. (RSH)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Gessner HarrisonUniversity of Virginia Philadelphia- June 6, 1853 My dear Eliza, We are both very desirous of being present at Mary's marriage, and if you could say about what time in July it would be, we would so arrange our departure from this place, so as to go to Bedford &amp; to reach the University by the appointed day. We do not expect to stay at Bedford more than a fortnight-but in our journey through the valley, we may stop a day at Winchester but I presume the whole journey from Bedford Springs to Albemarle will not require more than 5 or 6 days. If Mary wants any thing of a bridal character here, she can say so, and it will not be necessary to send on the money. Your mother desires me to say that she has met with linen damask table cloths of sufficient quality 1 3/4 yd. wide at 62½ cents per yard, so as to make a dollar &amp; a half a piece. If either she or Maria Broaddus wants any she can bring 2 or 3 in her trunk. The Rives's left Philadelphia this morning for Albemarle. I yesterday went out to Mr. J. Francis Fisher's country seat, where they had been since Saturday to see them. They are all in good health, &amp; are anxious to get to a place of rest. Edward Coles &amp; myself passed a very pleasant day with them. I am truly sorry for the premature fate of Mrs. Courtenay. When there are so many children unguarded by the ever watchful eyes of a mother there is great danger of their suffering in health manners &amp; minds from neglect or mismanagement. I have little doubt, from all I hear, that Dr. Maupin will be appointed to the chemical chair, if he promises to accept. I have heard of no candidate for the pofessorship of Natural Philosophy but Mr. Smith. Let me know how this is. I have heard nothing of the Emmets since their arrival from Bermuda. Your Aunt Fanny writes me that Addis had insisted on a visit from her in the course of the summer, &amp; she showed some disposition to accept—but I hardly think the pleasures of the trip are worth the trouble &amp; expense. Your mother sends her love, &amp; loins me in regards to the Doctor Maria Mary etc. I am your ever affectionate father George Tucker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia, June 10th 1853 My dear Cousin Mama received Aunt Mary Jane's letter this evening saying that you had some thought of coming over to see us in a week or two, and I cannot lose any time in begging you to do so by all means. We were just consulting as to how we could get you to come, and I was so delighted when it was mentioned that you would probably do the very thing we wished. I am afraid you will think me very selfish in this, and in some degree I am for I shall be very thankful to get your assistance in some things, but I trust you know us all well enough to know that we all want very much to see you for your company alone. Most of my heavy work is done, but then there are so many nice little things to be made that take time, and I have so completely broken myself down with work, that even a little thing seems to me a heavy undertaking. Here there are so many interruptions that it quite discourages me. I cannot do a quarter as much as I did while I stayed with Aunt Maria, and I am quite in despair when I look forward to the near approach of speeches etc. when any steady application to wirk is so difficult. Knowing how rapidly you use your needle and how ready you are always to lend a helping hand, my thoughts turned directly to you, and I hope that your engagements will allow of your leaving home soon. I hope you will not be alarmed at the prospect of so much time, for I am sure you would not think what remains to be done anything very great, and if we both work some, I am sure there will be ample leisure for recreation too. We are all glad to hear that Grandma is in the main better, but very sorry that she still suffers so much. I hope dear little Willie is better. Aunt Mary Jane did not say that Aunt Margaret had any thoughts of coming over. I wish you could all be here, but that I suppose is not possible in Grandma's state of health. Grandpa &amp; Grandma Tucker will be influenced in their movements by the time of my marriage and as no precise time can be named for that until after the 29th, I suppose they cannot yet say exactly when they will pass through the valley. I was very much shocked to hear of Mrs. Douglass Gray's death. She was a lovely woman, and her loss must be deeply felt by her family. I suppose you have heard of the death of Mrs. Courtenay's twins. They were nearly six weeks old when they died and were buried in the same coffin. I have not seen Mrs. Stevens for a long time, when you come I daresay I shall be able to go to see her oftener. Mama &amp; Maria returned Wednesday from Mr. Rives' where they stayed a week, and as I had the housekeeping to do, I was but too delighted when they got home. Bob had the measles very badly during their absence, and as, in addition I made a good many preserves, I was pretty well worn out in that short while. Bob is now quite well again, and the hair is actually coming out on his head at last. Flora is not yet able to do anything, but is recovering slowly. I went to see Lucy Grattan the other day, she is staying now at Mrs. Gilmer's in town. She seems to be a remarkably amiable girl. We have been going out strawberry gathering lately, and in two evenings got about 10 quarts. I think that was doing very well for the boys, I only went once. Pa, Ma, &amp; Maria join me in a great deal of love to Yourself, Garndma, Aunt Mary Jane, Aunt Mary, Aunt Margaret, Aunt Caroline. Remember me to Mrs. Rodes if she is with you and kiss all the children. Your affectionate cousin Mary Stuart Harrison Tell Aunt Caroline I am very much obliged to her for the work she has dono. We will expect her over certainly. (To Fannie M. Stuart)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia June 11th. 1853 My dear Mother, I wished to write to you this week, but have been so much occupied that I could hardly command the time. It is now nearly 12 o'clock at night, and I necessarily wearied with the day's work &amp; care, so that I shall hardly be disposed to write more than a few lines. I am afraid if I defer writing until Monday, I may be prevented. We have still some sickness in our family. Rosalie, we were confident, had the measles some weeks ago, although the eruption was very slight, (if it was eruption at all, which now seems more than doubtful) and she was very little ailing. She returned with her mother Wednesday from Mr. Geo. Rives complaining as if she had caught cold. She has been moping &amp; looked badly ever since. Today she has been feverish &amp; more ailing, and now the eruption of measles has manifested itself. The same thing has occurred with two of the black children. Bob has nearly quite recovered, and Flora is walking about some. Eliza received Mary Jane's letter yesterday, for which we very thankful. We were glad to learn that you were generally something better, although still suffering. I hope you may gradually improve, and that you are resigned to the will &amp; appointment of your Heavenly Father. Commit yourself to His care, assured that he will order all things for the best. Never distrust his goodness and watchful care. We want no other proof of his unbounded love and compassion than that we have in the gift of His Son to ransom us from the death of sin to the life of righteousness. Mary Jane mentioned that Williette was ailing. I hope the dear little one is better. We shall be very anxious to hear from her. I understood from Col. Yancey, whom I saw a moment yesterday, on his way to Richmond, that Mr. Rodes had gone over the mountains. I trust Mary is better in health and spirits. I think it a good thing that they have formed a class for studying French. It will afford Mary useful diversion. It is good for us to be employed. Only let it be usefully, and, if possible, not in excess. By the way, I think you should be careful not to fatigue yourself with sitting up too long at a time. You must be exceedingly feeble, &amp; may very probably exhaust your little strength before you are aware. I am so anxious to see you &amp; the rest of the family, that I shall hasten over as soon as I can after the close of the session. But I do not pretend to form any plans as yet. I have so much work on hand, and so much commonly to attend to after the session closes, that I hardly can see yet at what time I may get away. If my life &amp; yours are spared, I shall hope to see you early in July. Give my love to all the family, including Margaret &amp; Wm. Stevens, &amp; to Aunt Baxter. Yr. son affectionately, Gessner Harrison Remember me to Mr. Cross.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harrisonburg Va,June 9 Mrs. Eliza L. C. HarrisonUniversity of Virginia Harrisonburg June (1853) My Dear Sister Many thanks to you for you prompt reply to my last letter, but I have not profited by your example, as it is more than a week since I received it. I am glad to say Ma continue to improve some little. She can sit up the greater portion of the day, though I think she exerts herself too much sometimes, she is so exhausted when night comes, she cannot rest very well. She has been suffering more with her throat for a day or two, has taken some cold I presume, she still suffers very much with palpitation of her heart. She always bids me not to flatter you to much in regard to her improvement. She cannot believe she is much better, as long as her throat and breast is so much affected, but I think her cough is better now than for a long time before. she is still obliged to take the Morphia. Poor little Villie is sick again. Margaret is very unhappy about her, but I hope she is not seriously indisposed. her eyes are somewhat inflamed, &amp; she has some fever. Maragret fears a head affection. The Dr. advised her to keep her very quiet to-day but that is very difficult to do. M's health is tolerably good now. Mary is still suffering a good deal, but I think she is in better spirits. She &amp; Mr. Cross with the other girls have formed a class for studying French &amp; some English studies. She is very much interested in it. I hope it will be of advantage to her. Minna is very well. We are looking a little for Mr. &amp; Mrs. Rodes &amp; little Lucie the last of this week. I hope they will come, we wish to see Lucie so much. I am sorry you will not be able to visit us this summer, but perhaps a trip later in the season will be more pleasant. We will be glad to see you whenever it suits you to come. We were not much surprised at the news your letter contained, as we had heard a rumor of it before. Caroline &amp; Fannie are very anxious to visit you then. Fannie wishes to go in a week or two. We can hardly all leave home at once, &amp; they will enjoy the visit more perhaps than I would. I have not thought of going. Will Mary &amp; Mr. Smith take a trip? If they do, cant they visit us. We will be pleased to have them with us a while. Caroline will send those things when she has an opportunity. Say to Maria we will be glad to see her &amp; Mr. Broadus &amp; Lida too this summer, if she is not to much interested in housekeeping. Cousin M. Effinger returned from Philadelphia a few days ago. I have not seen her, but she sent me word, that Mr. &amp; Mrs. Tucker intended coming up the Valley &amp; would stop with us a day or two. Do you know any thing of their arrangements? We will be very glad to see them, but I doubt if they come, as Mrs. Tucker objects to traveling in the stage. You have heard of Mrs. Douglass Grays death I presume. She died the same day I wrote to you. Her death was peaceful and happy. her babe is doing very well, but the second daughter is very delicate. They think she has a hip disease. Mrs. Williams starts to Baltimore next week to consult some physician in her case. The family dont think she can live long. I saw Mrs. Ruffner the other day, she has a fine boy. she is looking very well. Cousin Fannie Hunter has been very ill for several days, she is a little better this evening. Aunt Baxter is here now. She has been in the country for sometime, her health is not very good this summer. She sends her love to you and the family. Madame Bishop gives a concert in town to-night. Ma, Mary, Caroline, Fannie, &amp; Margaret join me in love to you Brother, Maria, Mary, Mr. Broadus, &amp; the boys &amp; Rosalie. We were disappointed that Mr. Gibson did not come to our meeting. We were delighted with Mr. Carter—he is an excellent preacher &amp; seems to be a deeply pious man. Mr. Bonnett was here too. Your affectionate Sister Mary Jane</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Middletown Conn.Jul 16 Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Charlottesville Virginia Middletown Ct. June 15, 1853 My esteemed friend Your favor by Yates Hunt was handed to me by him some days since, and I have written a letter to Dr. Harrison as you requested, but after further reflection I have some doubt as to the propriety of sending it. The question that has arisen in my mind is this-after having signed (as I did most cheerfully ) Dr. Smith's recommendation, will there not be danger of weakening the effect that may produce by giving occasion for a suspicion that I have been influenced more by feelings of friendship towards you or a concealed partisanship of some kind than by a conviction of your real merits and proper qualifications for the place? I do not know but I am altogether wrong in this, but the view has presented itself so strongly to my mind that I am inclined to hesitate, and desire to hear from you on the subject before forwarding the letter. Have the goodness to write me freely on the subject, as nothing could give me greater pleasure than to afford you any proper aid I may be able to in reference to this matter. I am fully satisfued of your ability, in every respect, to fill the place with credit to yourself &amp; the University of Virginia, and benefit to the cause of education; and would gladly do just the proper thing to aid you in obtaining the place. With a lively recollection of pleasant intercourse in former years, I remain very sincerely Yours respectfully John Johnston Mr. Francis H. Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. 17 June 1853 Dear Bro. Smith I write a few lines to let you know that our Bro James is very ill. He has been complaining of indisposition for a long time, and on walking out on Wednesday evening he fell upon the street and was helped home where he laid in a stupor during Wednesday night, all the time refusing to take medecine to relieve him. Yesterday however he consented to take some medicine, and to have leaches applied to his head by which means he experienced some relief, and is better today. His case is still very critical. We hope however he may recover soon. He seems to complain mostly of his head. I was with him several days this week. Eliza and I went to see him this morning, and altho he seemed somewhat better, yet he is not out of danger. I hardly think he will recover. His disease is complicated, the liver and brain however are the main points affected, and by the blessing of the Lord he may get better. I am glad to find that he and Hannah are disposed lay aside their difficulties with your family and mine. She told me yesterday to write you word how sick James is. I do not know when we shall be able to come to see you, but I hope soon. I should like to hear how the things answer that were sent last week. We have very warm weather, but we are getting a shower of rain to cool the air, and the prospect is, we shall have a good deal of it from the appearance of the clouds. We join in sending our love to all Most truly etc M. G. Hamilton Let us hear from you soon.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg June 17th 1853 My dear son Francis Yours of 14th inst was rec.d yesterday. In reply to what you say about yr health I say that Boils or Biles are considered by Medical solons as favorable to the general health of the body. They being the natural effort to throw off the corrupt matter of the body, &amp; the only attention necessary is to promote the discahrges by simple applications for a reasonable time, taking care that a perpetual issue is not contracted. The nausea complained of is no doubt traceable to yr mode of life. You do not perhaps take sufficient exercise. You have been instructed by me in these matters often before &amp; it may not be necessary to say much more now. As regards#your visit here &amp; the talked of bridal journey, I will give you my advice &amp; you have anticipated me, as you could see by consulting a letter I wrote Edw.d in May upon the subject of a northern trip. I think you have decided wisely to stick to Virginia. I am sure that a trip to the Springs would be of greater benefit than a northern trip. Yr. Ma &amp; I have been talking the matter over, &amp; she says that if it suits Marys arrangements she would greatly prefer your coming on immediately, &amp; remaining here a few days, &amp; from here going by way of Winchester &amp; the Valley to the Springs. You may wish to visit a week or two spent at Capon would do you good, &amp; we might possibly get over that far with you. After yr trip to the South West you could again return here or to the Uni. &amp; in case of yr election this w.d suit you. I would advise you not to think of a trip to the Northern cities. The lakes or falls might do, but the mountains of Va. are preferable to any of them. The Va. trip you must take, whether you are elected or otherwise. I think relaxation from duty &amp; a little bracing up is necessary to you &amp; perhaps Edward may need something that way. Yr. Ma says yr. friends will expect you here, so that without some better reason than you have already given for the nonperformance of her wishes will not be rec.d for good. Besides the presents hinted at could not so formally be made. I enclose to you two letters from Mr. Janney &amp; the other from Gen. Rust. You can use them as you may think best. They are placed in yr hands to do with as you please. They may possibly do you good. Gen. R. is a rather prominent Democrat, &amp; Mr. J. is known as a cautious man. We feel under many obligations to Mrs. Harrison for her kind invitation to us all, but I suppose you know that we could hardly all leave home at the same time, for so long a jouney, even to witness so interesting a ceremony, &amp; I do not know whether I myself can get out, so that you of course would not feel slighted in such case. Indeed my son I begin to feel some alarm at certain symtoms of threatened disease in my case. I commenced this letter on yesterday hoping to get it in the mail on 17th &amp; had written to the mark # on the first page. In the mean time a man called on farm matters &amp; we talked &amp; became excited &amp; animated, when while sitting on the old Tripod, there was such a rush of blood or something else which I felt sensibly passing up thro my neck to the head that I bounced out of my seat &amp; ejaculated "O my", called on Mr. Dulin to get me some water &amp; drank &amp; wet my head &amp; got relief. I have feared something of this sort all along, my make &amp; my habits all favour attacks of that sort. I often find my head feeling heavy &amp; dull, particularly after reading a good deal &amp; at night some whizzing or singing of the ears, sometimes for weeks &amp; days, night &amp; day. This has continued with little intermission for a year or two, untill I have come to regard it as of little moment. I have no doubt but it is all owing to disarrangement of the nervous tissue, want of regular &amp; proper exercise. Bro.s Sandy &amp; John have both had similar affections. Dr. Lee gave me some pills, would not bleed. I kept in the house all day &amp; took salts etc. &amp; read too much, so that I feel this morning (Saturday) a considerable dullness &amp; disturbance in the head. Otherwise my health is as good as could be expected. This spell tho a very slight one, hardly sufficient to attract serious notice, reminds me however that the time will come when perhaps you or Edw.d will have to take charge of the concerns at home. I have prayed the good Lord to whom I refer all my interests, that I might be able to fulfil what I perhaps presumptiously considered my mission here i.e. to raise up &amp; settle my children, as my father before me accomplished. I still hope this will be extended as a blessing to me, unworthy as I know myself to be. The shirts I am instructed to say will be taken in hand, &amp; 5 if not more may be ready by the time I should start to the Uni. if I should go. If I should conclude not to go, what w.d you think of it? or what would the family say? The journey is long &amp; the weather may be hot as now. Would you not excuse me? I am anxious to go. Write again &amp; soon. Dont forget yr dear friends in Md. Grandma &amp; Uncle Ed. I am afraid you have already forgotten them. They are the purest &amp; best people I ever know. God bless them. I sometimes fear that Summys mind is unsettled. He has often those odd ways of doing things looking dour &amp; &amp; says he cant help it. Cant sleep well, will get up &amp; go downstaire to see that all is right below &amp; many other odd freaks. I have to soold him often. I mention it now that you may if it comes in the way know how to use him etc. Kind treatment is best always. If I come out I will take Summy along. Our accademy is so poorly conducted that I have not sent How.d &amp; hardly can decide what to do with him &amp; Summy. Advise me. May the Good Lord Bless you is the prayer of yrs sincerely &amp; affectionately D. G. Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paid 6 Leesburg Va.Jun 20 Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Leesburg June 20th 1853 My dear son I could not enclose those letters with the one I wrote you dated 17th &amp; 18th &amp; I now send them in a seperate enclosure. Gen. A. Rogers of Middleburg would give you a most flattering letter, if you wish it I will get one, or you could apply direct to him. He is known as a legislator. Mr. Benedict is so low that he cant write you, but I understand he desired to do so if he was able, has expressed himself as gratified very much by yr letter, &amp; says he feels highly honored by the application, speaks in admiration of the terms of your compliments, &amp; of your character etc. I feel an assurance that you must succeed in your laudable enterprize, &amp; noble aspirations, fortune favours the brave, it is s.d. The position would afford you greater opportunities for usefulness, which w.d be used by you, I am sure to promote the good of man the good of society &amp; the Glory of God. This ought to be the design &amp; desire of aspirants. Give Edw.d incouragements. I hope that he will come out creditably &amp; nobly. Yr. Father D. G. Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Gessner HarrisonUniversity of Virginia Philadelphia— June 20—1853 My dear Eliza, We set out for Bedford Springs tomorrow, which is three days sooner than we had intended—but according to custom, as the time approaches for our leaving Philadelphia, the servants to secure places in time, either pick a quarrel with us &amp; leave us or behave so badly that we are obliged to turn them away— and for some days we have had but one in the house, and have been compelled to take our dinners at Miss Plumstead's. A comb has been bought for Mary, but as you did not give any directions about it, it is merely handsome without being costly. I feel very anxious about Mr. Smith's success, but am consoled with the belief that if he fails now, he will be more fortunate another time. I rather inferred that Dr. Schele had other views from his jocularly remarking on the preponderating influence of Dr. Howard &amp; his two sons in law &amp; Dr. H. &amp; his one.—and I thought at the time that he wouldhave had no objection to a like family influence through A. R.'s family. But these petty jealousies or rather manoeuvres are not worth serious notice, particularly as they may be easily defeated when they are discovered. We scarcely expect to be at Bedford Springs more than a fortnight, so that your letter directed to that place must reach me by the 7th of July. A letter from the University ought to get there in 4 or 5 days—so that you will doubtless be able to inform me of the result of the election—and if it is postponed, of thatfact &amp; the prospects of Smith. It was our intention of course to call on Mrs. Harrison, if we passed through Harrisonburg, as we expect &amp; if it does not too much delay our arrival at the University, to pass a night there. We expect also to make a similar visit to Mrs. Tucker in Winchester. Tell little Eliza, her grandmama has bought a doll for her, who, though in general very quiet &amp; well behaved, is easily made to cry—but she does not cry long as some naughty children do. Richard Dunglison goes to England in a packet that is to sail this week. He is very thin &amp; looks badly, without any particular complaint, &amp; his father thought a sea voyage would be likely to restore him, particularly as he will spend some time with his relatives. He seems to be his father's pride. He has good talents and the gentle amiable qualities of his mother. John is probably married 'ere this. To save time &amp; expense he prevailed on his betrothed to come out to California under the escort of Mr. King, his late principal, and thus the same overruling sense of convenience which often induces princes to disregard the ordinary rules of female decorum, has produced the like result with this humble pair, except that they have done from affection what the others do from reasons of state. Your mother joins me in love to the Dr. &amp; the children &amp; Mr. Broaddus. I am your affectionate father George Tucker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harrisonburg Va.Jun 23 Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Harrisonburg, Va. June 23rd '53 Dear Sir:- Your note came to hand this morning, and I have today written to Messrs Miller and McDonald, who are the only visitors with whom I have any very particular acquaintance. Your election to the place which you seek, will give me a great deal of pleasure, and I will most cheerfully do any thing in my power to promote it. In haste, yours Wm. G. Stevens</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia To The Board of Visitors of The University of Virginia Middleburg, Loudoun County 24 June 1853 To the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia Gent.n I have just learned that at your next session you will be called upon to fill a vacancy in the Chair of Natural Philosophy, and that Mr. Francis H. Smith of this county will be a candidate for the appointment. Ir gives me great pleasure to offer my testimony to his high claims to your consideration, and to assure you, that in my opinion he is every way worthy of the distinguished honour which he thus seeks at your hands. I have known Mr. Smith from his childhood. He gave evidence at an early period, of future distinction &amp; usefulness in the Republic of Letters, and has, for several years, been considered, I believe by all who know him, one of the most gifted &amp; promising young men in Virginia. Of his progress and attainments at your noble Institution, where he has been for the last three or four years, the Faculty will advise you. I have no pretensions to Scholarship myself, but from the universal testimony of those qualified to judge, there can be no doubt, that he would fill the Chair, honorably to himself &amp; with entire satisfaction to the Public. I know him as a man, &amp; can speak with confidence. He is a Gentleman of the highest character in all those qualities necessary to make the model of the Virginia student. And I am proud to know, that we have such material of domestic growth, for filling the Chairs of our Literary Institutions. His Father too, is one of our most respected Citizens. I trust, therefore, that on examination you will be satisfied of the high qualifications of Mr. Smith, and that the people of this, his native county, may have the gratification of seeing one of her sons occupying a position, so honouring to himself &amp; to them, &amp; so useful to his mother commonwealth. Most respectfully Yr. ob. serv.t Asa Rogers 24 June 1853 (Note enclosed) Dear Frank. I send the enclosed at the request of your Father whose letter has just reached me. I fear that no recommendation of mine will have much weight with the Board. Let it go for what it is worth. At any rate, you have my best wishes for your success. Arthur who is at home desires his kind regards to you. Yr. friend faithfully Asa Rogers (On the outside in F. H. Smith's writing is Gen. Rogers.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Bedford Springs— July 3d My dear Eliza, I had the pleasure of receiving both your letter &amp; the Doctor's directed to me at Hampton. We passed 16 days at that place, in general in great discomfort, &amp; I had a slight fever in addition to Louisa's indisposition. We went up the Bay to Baltimore where we stopped two days to rest, and then set off for this place which we reached in 2 days, on Monday the 28th of June. Your mother gave no signs of improvement for the first 3 or 4 days but yesterday &amp; today she has gained strength &amp; we have hopes from the effect of the mineral waters. Her liver however still inactive, &amp; she takes all her meals in her bed room. I am sorry that the Doctor has so much trouble with his book—but I trust that it will eventually make him some return for his labor. I received the copy he sent me, &amp; was able to run over it hastily, but was obliged to leave my copy in Baltimore in the care of a friend. Should it be favorably noticed by European critics, it will doubtless have an extensive sale here. I feel much obliged by Mr. Tutwiler's friendly notice of my history. The weather is doubtless as sultry with you as it seems to have been every where else, and both students &amp; Professors must suffer severely during the present month. Mrs. Pollard writes us that George Pollard mentions George Harrison in very favorable terms. We expect to remain here until about the 18th or 20th, but we have not determined whither we shall go, as we do not expect to be in Albemarle until about the middle of August. I also received a letter from Maria while at Hampton &amp; shall answer it next week. This is a dull place to me. The company was not 20 when we arrived, &amp; is less than 50 now. I have no books to read, &amp; but few newspapers. I am well in health but thinner than ever you saw me, and more than one person has discovered a strong likeness between General Jackson &amp; myself. Remember us in the kindest terms to the Doctor, Mary &amp; Mr. Smith. If you write immediately this letter reaches you, your letter will find me here. I am your ever affectionate father George Tucker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg July 4th 1853 My dear son Francis With feelings of proud satisfaction &amp; gratitude to God, I acknowledge the r.pt of your very welcome letter of 28th ult. conveying the pleasing intelligence of your success before the B.d of Visitors. This high honor reflects credit upon the whole connexion. You have earned it by your sole exertions, under the blessing &amp; directions of a good providence, which has ever guided you. Your high position is a responsible one, &amp; we shall be anxious that you should sustain yourself, &amp; that the school over which you are called to preside will loose none of the interest imported to it by your worthy predecessor while under your charge. The prayer of your anxious Father was. Lord grant success to my son Francis in his efforts to obtain a higher position of usefulness, so that I would call your attention to the fact that you owe a heavy debt of obligation to that Good Being who has ever been your friend &amp; guide. Never forget your duty to Him. It is so natural for man to forget his duty to God, while honored by men. I hope the faith of my beloved son is rooted &amp; grounded in God. We notice flattering newspaper notices of yr appointm.t. We receive continually the gratulations of yr friends here. It is the nature of man to laud a rising Genius. Let all your efforts be aimed at adding honor &amp; dignity to the station you have been placed in. I am still undetermined about the journey to the Uni. If I come I think I sh.d take the short out in my Rockaway &amp; take time leaving here about the Wednesday preceeding the 20th inst. There are difficulties in that arrangement. If you should conclude to visit Leesburg going out, you travelling in a pull convey.e would get here before I c.d return. Ellen is anxious to know yr. definite arrangement. She wishes to know if you intend to have much company with you. Can you not if this reaches you write to her at once. Perhaps a visit on yr return would be as well, when you could quietly spend a week or more with us &amp; rest yrself, but I cant approve yr northern visit I should greatly prefer a visit to the different Va. Springs, to enjoy the mountain air &amp; scenery, the good mt.n mutton, venison etc &amp; see the elite of the South who congregate there usually. Yr health w.d more likely be promoted by this trip. As regards yr friends funds, you may if I do not come draw on me for the whole or part as you like, a part w.d suit my means best just now, &amp; the bal. in a month or two. If I come I will pay you there, otherwise place yr dft endorsed well in yr Bank for collection &amp; it will be done. I did not get yrs till Sat, 2d inst. It was postmk 29th June. I fear this will not reach you at home, &amp; will request yr P.M. to forw.d it if he knows yr whereabouts. Write immediately. You say I must by all means come out about the 20th, &amp; you are to spend 2 or 3 weeks at the spgs. That alone w.d fetch the 20th. I would like to hear more definite arrangements. I feel deeply indebted to Dr. Harrison for his friendship tow.d you, &amp; this would prompt me to try &amp; come out that I might personally present him my warm thanks &amp; acknowledgements for his very effective attentions to the interest of my dear son, during his residence at the Uni. Be not elated my son, conduct yrself soberly &amp; with great dignity. Your blushing honors come thick upon you. In less than one short month you are put into high station &amp; will have conferred upon you as I understand one of the most dignified, pious &amp; amiable ladies of the land for a wife. It is enough to excite the envy of the less fortunate. Beware of such. May the Good Lord continue to bless &amp; prosper you, &amp; the sweet Lady yr intended wife, &amp; the good family with whom you will connect yrself Receive yr fathers Blessing also. Affectionately D. G. Smith P. S. Ellen w.d prefer yr visit here as you go on north, if there w.d not be much company with you. Our house capacity w.d not afford accomodations for more than 4 or 5 including yrself. She says she is not strong enough to undego much fatigue. The mails are so sluggish that probably we shall not get a letter from you before the time you have fixed for yr marriage. Edw.d will come if I do not &amp; he may accompany you on yr journey. I write in baste. You must correct &amp; punctuate.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Banister Lodge July 7th 1853 My dear Mother I would have written to you sooner, but since I arrived here I have been going about visiting so much that I have hardly had time. As it may interest you some little I will give you some account of our journey. We reached Richmond in safety about sundown, Wednesday evening. We staid at Mrs. Bruce's, who lives, I think on Schockoe hill. We spent a day there, &amp; the next day we got on the care to come here. Mrs. Bruce came also, as she was on the way to Mr. Charles Bruce's. Besides us, there were on the cars Mr. Logan &amp; Mrs. Tom Coleman both of whom I knew very well. Mr. Logan had his sister with him, who had been going to school in Richmond. She is a very pretty girl indeed. Mr. Coleman had his cousin also, who is very pretty too. After we had travelled about 70 miles by rail-road we had to proceed by stage the remainder of the journey. In the stage I was introduced to the 2 young ladies I mentioned by their cousin Mr. Coleman, &amp; we had a very pleasant journey, altho' the weather was excessively warm. I reached this place friday evening, late at night. I found Mrs. Clark to be a very kind &amp; cordial lady, &amp; she made me feel at home directly. Mr. Clark also is a very kind &amp; hospitable gentleman, he told me to tell Pa that he would be very glad if he would pay him a visit. Mrs. Clark performs beautifully on the piano. She has a great variety of tunes, it is a great treat indeed to listen to her. I have not heard her perform on the harp yet but she promised me she would play for me as soon as she could. She is now at Mr. Charles Bruce's. She has several little daughters, who seem to inherit their mothers taste for music, &amp; they play very well indeed for their ages. I have had a very pleasant time indeed since I have been here. We drive all around here visiting in a buggy with two horses. Monday the presbyterians had a fair at Halifax C.H. &amp; we all went there. There was a very large assembly indeed. I saw a great many very pretty young ladies. I never saw so much money made at a fair in my life, they made $650 in one day. We went the other evening to Mr. Carringtons to pay a visit &amp; found there only 7 young ladies. Wednesday we went to Mr. Grammer's (the Episcopal clergyman) &amp; found there 5 young ladies. I met there Mrs. Barksdale who said she knew you &amp; invited me to come &amp; see her. Mr. Tom Lee came up &amp; was introduced to me last Monday, &amp; he told me also that he knew you very well &amp; invited me to come &amp; see him. After leaving Mr. Grammer's we went to see Averett &amp; took dinner with him. After dinner we went to John Clark's brother-in-law's Mr. Tom Bruce's where we spent the night. This morning we went over to see Mr. Logan Old Mr. Logan told me he knew Grandpa Tucker very well. Mr. James Bruce sent word also that he wd be glad to see me. So you see I have been very well attended to, since I have been here. The people here are far more stylish than those about Charlottesville. I have met a great many persons who knew Grandpa Tucker &amp; also many who were old students. Mr. Claiborne, son-in-law of Mr. Clark, asked me after Uncle Rush, he lived, I think, next door to Mr. Broadus office Perhaps you recollect him. John Clark requested me to give you his best respects. I wd be much obliged to you if you will tell Tom to ask Elijah about John Clark's hat, he left a hat &amp; a cup at the University-he wishes Tom to take care of it for him. As it is late I must conclude. Write to me soon. Give my love to Pa, Maria, Mary, Edward &amp; the rest of the children &amp; family, (see preced. g p.) P. S. Address your letter to Halifax C.H. care of W.H. Clark. With love to all I remain, Your affectionate Son G. T. Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg Va.Jul 11 Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Va. Leesburg Va. July 9th '53 Dear brother Papa requests me to inform you what plans we have concluded on. It appears that we will start on Saturday the 16th— go to Warrenton Springs on that day—on Monday to Orange &amp; perhaps on the next day to the Univ.—but possibly a halt of one day may be made to look at farms. At any rate, we expect to reach the Univ. in time. It seems to be the general opinion that it would be better for you to call at home on your return from the tour. The question however is yet open—&amp; left to be decided when I see you. You shall have my services very gladly on the 21st. It is not entirely certain that Pap will be down: I shall be there if it is possible. Pap says he can assist you in the "furniture" bill to the extent of seven or eight hundred at least. Just returned myself from a small breeze in Maryland. Grandmother hopes to see you, she says, one of these days—when— she has no definite idea. I could not give much encouragement to the hope that it would be very soon. Yr affec. bro. Edw. B. Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sherwood July 16th 1853 My dear Eliza, I write a few lines to say that I will not be able to go up before Wednesday. One of the carriage horses is very lame from having been improperly shod &amp; could not be safely used earlier than that day. Mr. R. got back from Nelson yesterday very much broken down from the ride. I fear I shall not be able to prevail on him to go to the wedding. Henry &amp; I are going up to Alta Vista this evening on horse back to return tomorrow evening. M. Bell &amp; P. Henderson will return in a few days to New York and I shall not have another opportunity of seeing them. Tucker will come down on the boat to Scottsville Monday where we will send for him. He will probably beg so hard, &amp; be so jealous of Rosalie that you must not be surprised if I bring him also to the wedding. I suppose Papa &amp; Mama are with you by this time, if so, give a great deal of love from me. Uou are quite excusable for having forgotten my letter to Papa, there was nothing of consequence in it. He probably only thought me a little negligent of his request to write, which he will find on his arrival was not the case. I have a nice saddle of mutton which I am trying to keep on ice for you, at Mr. Timberlakes, all ours I am sorry to say is gone. Will you wish James to assist in waiting Thursday night? or will you have enough without him? He could very well come up that day if you wish it. Henry got a letter from George last evening. He desired him to give his thanks to M. for her letter of invitation &amp; tell her how sorry he was that he could not accept it. He will be thrashing his wheat and cannot at that time possibly leave home. Robert is much gratified by his invitation. He has this week been very sick though now well. He had one of his usual attacks and after that several severe chills. He was at Redlands &amp; did not get home till last evening. Isaetta was much pleased at being invited &amp; will go. I fear A. &amp; Ella Rives will hardly be able to come as they will the night before be at Miss M's marriage &amp; will be to much fatigued after sitting up so late. Mrs. Stark continues to improve. I am sorry Maria has moved as I fear she will be do busy at home I shall not see much of her. Willie was much pleased with Charlie's letter. If you have anything to say to me, send the letter to the office Monday as the mail comes out early Yuesday. Your affec. sister Maria</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. July 29th 1853 Dear Bro S. It gave us great pleasure to rec.d yours yesterday, and we are sorry we cannot avail ourselves of your kind invitation. You are aware of my obligations to attend to Havre. I am placed in a position between duty and pleasure, and the question is, can we enjoy pleasure in one place while duty calls our attention to another? We should take pleasure in being with you when Francis brings his bride home, and should like very much to pay our respects to the newly married couple, as well as their friends. But we do not see how we can enjoy another pleasure trip this summer. You will not therefore expect us as I do not think we can make it convenient. We will attend with pleasure to all commissions in due time. Write when you want the Good things. We can send them to the Point and you can get them the same day. We will do the best we can for you. By the Divine goodness we are well. James is getting a little better. I am convinced that we were benefited by our visit to L., and this only causes the more regret that we cannot get to see you again. Dr. Davis will talk about going to the springs, but did you ever know my Father to go from home? Well so it is with the Dr. and then he is getting busy, there being a good many children sick. We have had some excitement, the Mayor stopping street preaching. The people think he has no right to do it. It is at the instigations of the Catholics, and the Sun being a Catholic paper does not give a true version of affairs. I would not patronize that paper on any account. The Clipper contains a full and complete account of the matter. About 5000 citizens marched to the house of the Mayor and requested him to resign. Dont know what will be the result of it. All parties are against his honour the Myor in the matter. Our love to all. M. G. Hamilton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Aug 10th 1853 Dear Bro. Smith We have rec.d yrs of the 2nd and 8th insts, and have attended to yr requests as well as we could this hot weather. I ordered the books to be put in Pennamans Box, and the good things will be sent by themselves. All to arrive at the pt. of Rs on Saturday next, and we hope you will get them safe. Let us know. As regards the Boys I have not been able to learn by any means any thing about them. Hope by this time you have heard from them. If any thing uncommon had happened them you would soon hear, for nothing seems to escape the newspaper reporters. E. and I very much regret not being able to come again, but we do not see how it can be done this summer. Our love to Francis and his Bride. and all the rest. Yours truly &amp; aff. M. G. Hamilton Please hand the within to Miss Nancy. I forgot it when in L.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Aug. 12 1853 Dear Br. S. The box of confectionary will be sent off this evening so as to reach the Point of Rocks tomorrow morning. The Pine Apples and Oranges cannot be had of a quality sufficient to send. The rest of the things are forwarded. Hope you will get them safe, and sound. We have most extremely hot weather, and are trying to keep as cool as possible. There are too campmeetings in progress noe for Baltimore. But the weather is most too warm for us to attend. They are said to be very large. I go to H. de grace every Saturday. We should like to be you if it were not quite so hot and other things would permit. Hope you are all well. Our love to all. Most truly etc. M. G. Hamilton We have great cause of gratitude to God that we are well at present. Our love to Francis &amp; Lady, with our very best wishes.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Carters Bridge, VaAug. 19 Mrs. Gessner HarrisonUniversity of Virginia Sherwood Aug. 19th 1853 My dear Eliza In compliance with your request I write to tell you that you may expect Papa &amp; Mama next Tuesday; the day this summerfor arrivals and departures. Tell the girls we missed them very much. About an hour after they left, Mr. Douglas and Elizabeth came &amp; spent the day. E. regretted not meeting them, she invited us to dine with her Wednesday. Papa, Mama &amp; I accepted calling by Mr. Stevenson's on the way. We spent a pleasant day. In the afternoon Mr. &amp; Mrs. Buckner, some of their children &amp; Mary Fisher walked over. I felt some what ashamed to meet them, as they have been for weeks at Mrs. H's and I have never called on them. I got a note from Mrs. Robert Carter yesterday telling me that our new Preacher Mr. Nelson would have service at the Church Sunday and she hoped we would attend, which we are most happy to do. I hope he will prove an interesting preacher, as it seems to be our only chance. He has just been ordained though a married man, having previously been a lawyer. We were a good deal disappointed at not seeing Dr. H. when the carriage returned Monday evening, and hope he will be able to come next week when very probably the weather will be more agreeable. I think it very well Mr. R. has been kept at home this week as the workman (at last) arrived Wednesday and he would not have known exactly how to go to work without his instructions. I got a letter from F. Gwathmey a day or two since, she said she intended writing to you also in a few days. She gave me the pleasing intelligence that she would most probably accept our invitation and with Fanny and little Robert spend the winter with us. Virginia she said would be married about the 1st of November. I wish it was more certain that she was making a good match Poor F. said that she herself hoped to go to housekeeping in the spring, when by taking a few girls as boarders, keeping a cow and selling some of the milk etc she hoped to be able to support her family. I am so glad it occurred to Mr. Rives to invite her to spend the winter, I am sure it will be a very seasonable aid to her. She is feeling much anxiety about her son Theodore, who is now in New Orleans, where the Yellow fever is raging with more violence than it was ever known before. As he had it while living in Mobile I hope he may now escape. She seems with Christian trust to be endeavoring to be resigned to whatever may be God's will respecting him. Tom Macon has lost his wife there, after three days illness, and was himself recovering from a violent attack of the disease when his mother last heard from him. I hope you have by this time heard from Mary more than once again. It will soon be time for them to be turning their faces homewards, if they expect to be at the University as soon as they thought when they left. I hope Jack is putting the house in nice order for them. Flora thinks she is improving, she says her appetite is much better than when she came out. I am sorry to hear from her how sick Miranda has lately been. Poor Mrs. Stark has a rising breast, and is very much depressed. I hope it will not be tedious however, as it is not deep seated. That was indeed a most distressing affair of Lewis Randolph's, and though there are many extenuating circumstances connected with it, it must always be a source of wr wretchedness to himself and all his family. From what has been found out since of the condition of the negro at the time, it seems probable that he died from other causes than the slight wound given by the pocket pistol but as this was not ascertained, there is fear that the contrary opinion will most widely prevail. I feel deeply for them all. Mr. Rives has been to see them, and both Dr. Randolph &amp; Sally seem extremely grateful for the sympathy he has shown them. Edward amuses himself hunting, and while so engaged yesterday found some very good peaches for me on our Mc estate. Papa has just come in where I am writing and says you may expect them Monday instead of tuesday, as it will give Dr. H. a day longer in the week to make the trip to Nelson. E. Douglas said if I had not told her I was expecting Dr. H. she would have sent for you both to join us the day we dined with her. You must have had a warm walk to Mr. Maury's. I do not know how you could have ventured. All join me in love to yourselves and Maria, when you see her. Your fond sister Maria Rives</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sherwood Aug 22d 1853 Dear Eliza Willie seems disposed to return today and if Peachey has not gone with his aunt M. Jane to the country he had better some out, unless you may fear that an opportunity of their getting back in time for school, might not occur. The vacations are so long that it would be a pity for them not to be in place at the opening of school. Tucker is engaged at Frank Ruffins and as the school does not begin until Oct. we have the pleasure of his company for five or six weeks yet. Rosalie would be very glad if you would let your Rose come out in the carriage also. I Hope Dr. H. will be able to escape from his duties for a few days, but have not much expectation of it. We went to Church yesterday and heard Mr. Nelson. He has earnestness of manners, and was sometimes forcible in what he said, but he does not know how to manage his voice well. He has the appearance of being in delicate health. I do not believe he has positively decided on coming to this parish yet, and I am afraid it is our only chance for a minister. Tell Mary and Mr. Smith when they return that we will certainly a visit from them in the course of September there would not be much chance for it after the session began. I forgot to give Charley the 25 cts. sent to him as I do not think he found it necessary to have his shoes mended so that you can retain a quarter out of the 50 cts. I sent, and only send me 25 of good peaches of either kind, if they are not good today it is not of consequence sending them now, as at this time I have some very good ones the boys got for me last week not being bruised at all they keep without rotting. I send you a half bushel of lima beans and some tomatoes. I have not so many of the latter as I have had, they are beginning to declino, and yours I suppose are just coming to perfection. Those little pears I sent you are the best stewed I ever tasted. I had not tried them when I sent them. Parboil them, pour off that water and then add sugar and a little more water. They have much more flavour than the larger ones. With love to all Your affec. sister M. Rives Flora desires me to say that "she thinks she is improving smartly, and is very much pleased a great many calls were made on her yesterday and she attended church with much satisfaction. Jonny is anxious that she should spend some days with him this week. He is a relative. I hope she will be much benefitted by the trip.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sherwood Aug. 28th 1853 My dear Eliza Would you believe it Dr. Harrison forgot to give me your note until yesterday morning! when he by accident came across it in his pocket. They made a shorter stay in Nelson than at another time they would have been permitted to do. Gen. Brown was obliged to leave home the day after they got there to meet an engagement beyond Lynchburg, &amp; could neither dine with them at Oak Ridge or have them at his house. Dr. H. admires very much sister Peggy's establishment, management etc, but he was so much taken up with reading Jane Eyre while there that he did not walk about as much as he might to have done. Sister Peggy was much gratified by his visit. They met her coming down to Alta Vista, but she would insist on turning back. You are mistaken in thinking Papa &amp; Mama are not coming out again. I shall be much disappointed if it is not the case as papa told me the morning he left he would do so but said the next visit would be shorter. We will also be much disappointed if Mr. S. and Mary do not come. They might do so when Papa does if Mama would not bring such a heavy trunk, she might lay some of her things in the drawers until she returns. Burwell said the carriage was too heavy the other day, that the trunk seemed to way down the springs before they got in. I long to hear Mary tell of all she has seen. Mrs. Douglas wrote Elizabeth she should call upon them as soon as she heard they had arrived in Leesburg. Have you seen anything of a pr. of light colored kid gloves in the lower dressing room? Mama said she had seen a pr. I think I left them at the end of the session. I had not worn them more than once or twice I rode over Wednesday and spent the day with Mrs. Stark. Edward went on to Mr. Douglas' to borrow his pointer, dined there and came by for me in the evening. E. is quite successful in hunting. I think tomorrow I will call on Helen Wilmer. With love to all Your affec sister M. Rives</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Sep 1, 1853 Dear Bro. Smith Although I wrote last I wave the formality of waiting for a letter, as you have doubtless been very much engrossed in entertaining your new daughter. You said in your last that you expected Francis the next day. I hope you have realized all your anticipations in their visit, and that happiness will attend them all through life. This, however, will depend much upon their acknowledgement of God in all their Ways that He may direct their paths. Jer. 10.23. Prov. 3. 5-6. My principle object at this time is to say something about Guano, and I am sorry to have nothing new to say. The precious article still continues very scarce. I heard a man offer today $50 pr Ton, while it is quoted at $43 &amp; 44 in the papers, but he could not get it at any price. I am convinced that your best chance (if you have not bought) will be with Fitzehew Coyle, the agent for Washington City. He is the Agricultural man on 7th St. near Lathams Bank. I see no chance for you here. They say there is plenty coming in, but when it will be here we cannot tell at present. We hope to see you soon, as you stated in your last. We are happy to say that Balt. continues to be healthy, and when we consider the awful scorge which has been visiting New Orleans and other places we have great cause of thankfulness to our heavenly Father for His goodness towards us in this respect, and in all respects. Some of the churches in this City are at present favoured with revivals of Religion. The most successful is Monument Street, where scores are inquiring what they must do to be saved. May this become a general thing in this and every place. I am still attending to H. de Grace, and up to this time that place is entirely healthy, as much so as any place. We don't make our home there, but are trying to do them some good. Our love toaall. Yours most aff M. G. Hamilton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia Sep 3rd 1853 My dear Mother As I promised to write you as soon as possible after our arrival here, I thought I would make the attempt this morning, although I feel so stupid from the effects of a cold that I am afraid I must give you a very dull letter. We arrived here yesterday and found almost all the family at the cars expecting us. Every one at home is well, and of course it makes me very happy to be with them all again. We reached Culpeper Court House the same day we left you after quite a fatiguing ride, b ut after resting there that night and nearly all the next day we felt considerably refreshed, and ready to undertake the rest of the journey with renewed strength. We left father and Edward at Culpeper but Mr. Smith thinks they will probably be at home before this letter reaches you. I did not go with them to look at Mrs. Bradford's farm, b ut spent the day very pleasantly with some relations I met there. To-day the rain is pouring down and although it makes everything look gloomy I am glad it did not overtake us while we were still travelling. We met Dr. Clagett in Charlottesville just as we got out of the cars, but he said that he was just on the point of leaving, so we could only exchange a few words. We have not been able to procure a cook yet, nor can we hear of any one at all who would suit, but we will make every effort, for I do not suppose we shall feel settled or comfortable now until we get to housekeeping. All the silver came safely, not a single thing was hurt, the glass and pitcher as well. Ma and all our friends here admired our presents very much. After we came home we examined the sugar tongs and butter knives we had here, and found them so inferior to those which we left with you to exchange that we thought that we would change (part of a letter from Mary Stuart Smith to her mother-in-law Mrs. D.G. Smith after her honeymoon)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">V M I Sept 4th 53 My dear Ned I have not received received a letter from for three weeks or more &amp; I cant tell the reason. Whether you have writen or not I cannot say. We marched over to the Rockbridge Alum Springs &amp; made the short stay of a week. But not withstanding the short time we stayed we had a very pleasant time. I expected meet with Miss Cornelia there but was very disagrable disapointed. I have not heard any thing any thing from her but once since I have been here &amp; that was throug Issack. He told Ma to tell me that he saw her riding on horse back behind a buggy. But I expect he was mistaken. If you have heard any thing from her for gracious sake write to me about it. Write me all about my dogs horse &amp; every thing concerning home. I do not expect that you got my last letter. I wrote to you ask you to send me some good chewing Tobacco. Please get me some good chewing tobacco from Mondays down town and put it in a little box &amp; send it to me for there is none in 10 miles of the place. I will send you the money as soon as I get it from home. Please be certain to send it as I have not had any fit chew since I have been here. I find a good many fine fellers here. But I get very homesick when I think of the fun I would have if I was back with you. Please excuse all leving out word &amp; bad speling &amp; also very bad writing. All of my room mates join with me in love to you &amp; all the boys. I remain your dev. friend E. Garth</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg Sept 10th 1853 My dear son Francis. Yrs of 3d is at hand &amp; we are glad you are safe at Home, &amp; all well. I hope &amp; pray that the Good Lord will continue to smile upon you. I did not remain at Culpeper, but on the morning after you left we started on our return. I found that Mr. S. Bradford had made arrangements to buy &amp; was anxious to have the farm. I considered that should I remain to the sale, I should in the excitement of bidding pay more for the farm than my cooler judgement w.d approve. When I have an object in view I am not apt to knock under to any man &amp; therefore thought more prudent to withdraw. We are lonesome here on acct of the absence of Mary &amp; you. We hope you are getting on finely. I regret to hear by Marys letter that she is indisposed. The first thing you do, after dedicating yr new home to the daily acknowledgement of God, is to provide yrself with a good Bath, &amp; you &amp; Mary take it every morning. You will become fond of it. So yr wish is gratified in my failure to get Afton &amp; you now insist upon getting Morven (Mr. Higginbothams farm). It is a large farm, 12 to 13 hundred acres at 20$ is 24 to 26 thousand dollars, in 4 equal annual payments 6000 to 6500 pr An. &amp; Int. if at 6500 the 1st w.d be 6890$ 2d 7280$ 3d 7670$ 4th 8060$ in all $29,900. The farm at a cost of 26000$ w.d be equal to an annual Int of $1560, to which must be added taxes say 80 to 100$ rep.rs 150-so that it should rent for about 2000$ pr An. to pay even a reasonable dividend. Will it do that? If it is good land, a little over the average of Va. land in the Piedmont region, it ought to do it, &amp; 75 pr ct over that. I suppose that a reasonable time will be given for a resale, in the mean time see the parties &amp; ascertain if the 20$ at which it was bid in will buy it, &amp; whether a contract could be made to take the farm about the 1st of March, from which date to make the payments, when possession w.d be required in time for spring crops, or when if sold at Pub. sale it will take place. Then I want you to make a thorough &amp; strict examination of the whole premises, &amp; be able to give me answers to the following queries, so that I may determine whether it w.d be worth while for me to come out again. Discribe the various buildings, size &amp; condition &amp; materials in few words. 1. What has been the average yield of wheat for 5 yrs or 10 yrs past pr acre &amp; in agregate? Do of corn etc etc 2. What is the shape of tract. How wood land located. 3. No. of fields &amp; sizes, condition of fences. 4. Kind of timber, quality &amp; quantity, any locust on the farm? Chesnut, oak, pine, what proportions 5. Water for House, dairy &amp; bathing purposes. How convenient, &amp; quantity. Do. for Stock how fields supplied Is it pure &amp; wholesome? 6. What sort of stone predominates over the soil. Rock? is there much for fencing? &amp; has it been used for the purpose on the farm? 7. What proportion is up land &amp; what low land or flat as they call it in that county. N.B. The low land is I understood of very inferior quality. 8. What the condition of the fields? are they in grass? if so what sort? &amp; how covered? is it good grazing land? What sort of sheep pasture w.d it afford. is it kind for Blue grass? this is important. I should expect to graze 500 to 1000 sheep on such a farm, could it be done? 9. What is the character of neighborhood? what convenience for churches, schoold, mills etc. 10. Garden, Orchard &amp; other fruit 11. Any limestone upon it or near it? what quantity of meadow &amp; meadow land. if meadow how sett &amp; what sort of grass. &amp; any other matter relevant to this inquiry. If the farm is too large could a portion be sold readily? These are particular inquiries, very, but necessary. You can list them off on a seperate paper &amp; in one days examination c could answer them. In all these preliminaries of business I shall always consider myself as under the direction of Him whom I delight to acknowledge in all my ways, &amp; if it is His will that this enterprize shall prosper &amp; redound to my happiness &amp; the benefit of my children, &amp; should it succeed, I shall feel that is of my Makers bounty to me an unworthy son. God created nothing independent of himself, &amp; it is His will that his creatures should always feel &amp; acknowledge their dependence upon Him. I believe that you have been raised to the elevated position you now occupy for the purpose of glorifying Him, by doing good. You have had a moral &amp; virtuous training &amp; received blessings unspeakably great from Him in yr conversion. Take my advice &amp; join His church &amp; promote His work upon the earth. Take the example of yr Uncle Edward for faithfulness to the church &amp; love to God. You will be sustained in all positions in which you may be placed by His providence. He has promised to direct our paths if we acknowledge him in all our ways &amp; the blessed Saviour said Seek first the Kingdom of God &amp; His righteousness &amp; all other things shall be added. Cleave close to your best Friend &amp; Benefactor. Call on Him in your family daily. Establish his worship in yr house by erecting a family altar. The great lesson taught in the bible is our dependence upon God, &amp; the great duty inculcated is to love Him supremely. Lay down yr rules for all after life &amp; let yr duties to God be prominent. Wishing you &amp; Mary all health &amp; happiness, I am yrs with increasing affection D. G. Smith Accept our best love. Ed will write soon to Mary. Present my respects to Dr. H's family &amp; Rev.d Mr. Broadus &amp; Lady. (postcript to the preceding letter, found at a later date) Sept. 10. Since sealing the envelope I rec.d yrs by Culpeper &amp; as you seem so anxious, try &amp; get a delay of the sale untill I hear from you again, &amp; have time to get amt. if advisable. In this letter you say 900 acres can be had, does that include the buildings? if you can get the delay examine well as I requested in the enclosed letter &amp; let me hear soon. The time (March) mentioned would suit me best. See that the land is of good quality. I dont want a poor farm. I could sell out here during the winter. Goshen 10,000 Bd. Run 7,000 Leesburg 3,500 Store 5,000 Bonds 12,000 37,500 not all available soon. I could keep the Leedswood farm on which there will be to pay$7,500 in 2 or 3 yrs.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scranton Lackawanna Valley Sept 10 1853 Prof. F. H. Smith My dear Sir Your letter of the 5th inst enclosing a draft on the Farmers Bank of Va at Charlottesville for five hundred dollars, reached me yesterday evening. The term of your note was three months and would not expire until the 5th of next month. I hope you have not put yourself to any inconvenience in thus anticipating the time of pay.t &amp; beg you to leave the next pay.t to such time as may entirely suit you. Since I saw you in Phil.a we have been very busily engaged in the coal region on the Lackawanna &amp; east branch of Susqu Our head quarters are now at a village which ten years ago was without any thing to represent it but a little country mill. It now numbers four thousand inhabitants &amp; is the centre of a very large iron &amp; coal trade, with a wide-guage R. Road tying it to N. York &amp; a Hotel which would do credit to Chesnut St. So much for the vitality that comes from cool &amp; iron. You are by this time begin.g to think of Univ. matters &amp; the coming labours of the Lecture room. Be of good courage. Look forward &amp; be not over-anxious about the present. Mrs. Rogers sends her love to Mary &amp; joins me in kind regards to all the family. With best wishes I remain very truly your friend W. B.

      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg Sept 12th 1853 My dear son Francis I rec.d your letter direct, by Thursdays mail, &amp; the other by Culpeper only on Saturday. I wrote you by regular mail on 10th, but which will not get on untill today, &amp; having an opportunity by Mr. Orr today who goes to Warrenton I write this also, if peradventure it may arrive sooner. Yr letters are so pressing for an answer. I said in the other letter that you should get a delay of sale untill you could examine the premises &amp; correspond with me. I should not jump into a matter of such importance blindly There must be time &amp; opportunity to examine &amp; I dont think there is any great necessity for haste. The fact of its not having been sold at the Pub. sale will make all men cautious who are not acquainted with the farm, &amp; the disposition in man to get a better bargain w.d prolong a negotiation in such a case. I requested you to examine the premises. If the farm is desirable &amp; 900 acres of t the best c.d be had at 20$ &amp; my arrangements can be had, I think the probabilities w.d be in favour of the purchase strongly. I have not yet heard from Afton, but should not be much surprised to receive a proposition for the purchase of that farm. It is possible at least. Yrs affectionately D. G. Smith P. S. I have bargained to sell my large cattle 46 head for which I am to get 4$ pr 100 lbs gross w.t &amp; I think they will weigh 1250 to 1300 lbs. If I can get upon a farm I should greatly prefer the grazing to grian raising. Some 500 sheep or 1000 head cows, calves, colts, mules, swine. Poultry etc w.d occupy a reasonable portion of active life.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. HarrisonUniversity of Virginia Burwell Sherwood Sep 13th 1853 My dear Eliza As Mama Gorgot her work bag yesterday "having so many things to think of, Papa's, Georges gun etc," Burwell will go up for it today but I am glad to say not for that alone as I have to send my wood to the Factory which at any rate gave him the trip as far as Meriwethers Mill. It is such a good opportunity that I send you some quinces though they are not now ripe enough to preserve but will ripen in the cellar. I did not think of you sending me damsons as you now have three families to supply. I hear from Mama with surprise and regret that the cow we sent to Maria does not, (according to her understanding) give but one gal. of milk in the whole day instead of 2½ or perhaps more as she certainly did when she went from here. I saw what she gave in the evening myself which was a gal &amp; a half and in the morning though I did not see it measured it looked like four or five quarts. It is quite probable they leave too much for the calf-otherwise she could not have declined so very rapidly. Give my love to Mary &amp; Mr. S. and tell them we are very much disappointed that they cannot come out this month. It seems hard &amp; strange that I should give everybody a bridal dinner, but my own niece. Mr. Smith is feeling more anxiety than he need do I am sure about the introductory. I have no misgivings about it. I hope Maria will get her carpet done before she is confined. I hope Mrs. Broadus has come also as with your family you can not be as much with her as you would like I trust &amp; hope she will do well. Mama requests that you will wrap up her Morocco bag in paper so that it will not get rubbed. I must conclude. I am glad to hear from M. Rives that Isabelles health has improved considerably, she will be home now in a few days. Love from all to all. Your affectionate sister, M. R. Rives.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Middleburg September 16th 1853 Dear Ellen Prompted by a fervent desire that the peace and friendly intercourse that has so long existed in our family might continue I write this letter. Ellen you no doubt are aware ere this, that our feelings were very much wounded from the manner in which things were conducted dureing Franks visit in Leesburg. We certainly expected you would have shown us respect enough on that occasion to bid us be present. The kind of invitation you gave Mr. Smith I did not consider any invitation at all. I am sure Edward was over a few days before Frank came you could then if you had desired shown us that token of respect not that I cared one Iota about attending for I should hardly have gone that far to have seen Franks bride though I should like to have seen her if things had been conducted differently—-but Ellen was not your husbands relations good enough to welcome her. I ask the question, for it appears from circumstances they were not as not one of them were present. Do you think his Aunt Harriet would have been any disgrace to him in my opinion she would have been an honour. Daniels Boys ought never to forget her for did she not go there and take charge of these motherless children directly after their mothers death untill Daniels marriage and I think discharged her part faithfully. Ellen I do not write this without my husbands sanction for he requested me to do it and approves of every word I write. I can assure you he was exceedingly mortified when persons would ask him concerning the marriage to think he could give them no information as near a relation as he is. He did not mention it to Daniel when he was over because his feeling was so much hurt he forbore to speak of it. He does not think our family so greatly honoured by the alliance but considers the Smith family quite on a par with with any of the Harrison connection wherever it may be found and I think so too. I say nothing against Franks wife for I know nothing. She may be evry thing a woman ought to be and perhaps if I knew her I might love her very much, but is it worth while to make her think there are only a few people in the world good enough for her to associate with. As to Daniels children I have been very much attached to them I suppose it was on account of their loseing their Mother when they were so young, Francis particularly. We were pleased to hear of his success and his elevation to the Office he now holds—but think you it will not lower him in the estimation of the world if he forgets his relations. If we were ever to send one of our children to the university do you think he would know him. There is one thing certain I never expect either of my sons to be Professors but if one of them should so distinguish himself I do not think I should go beside myself. Ellen we profess to be Christians. Let us try and act as such in this respect and endeavour by all in our power to keep up the same kind feeling that has always prevailed in our family. I ask nothing more. We have enough of this worlds goods to satisfy our reasonable wants, for which I thank my heavenly father for every day that I live. I must now close. I hope I have said nothing harsh. If I have I did not intend it but merely to lay my whole heart open to you—as one Sister should to another. All are well and desire to be remembered to all, hopeing that things may speedily wear a different aspect, I remain your affectionate Sister Anna M. Smith (To Mrs. D. G. Smith from her sister in law)</field>

Head Qu.s V M I Sept 17th 1853 Dear Ned I am aware that I have neglected you very much indeed. But I know that you will not think hard of me when you hear my excuse. I have so much to attend to that I have not the time to do any thing &amp; moreover on Saturday it is almost impossible to write as my room is all the time crowded full of the Cadets making all kind of noise &amp; then I have to go to drill &amp; a roll call every minute. Now you have my excuse &amp; I know that you will forgive me. The times over here are so dull that I can find nothing to write at least that tend to entertain you. On my arrival I did not get a putting through though every other Plebe did. Eugene was twisted very much &amp; had his extensive beard shaved off. By the Bye I wish if you see Billy Gilmer you will tell him that the report which he heard about Gennie &amp; I was not so. He says that the report was that we had come back home with half of our head shaved after the manner of Goliath of Gath. You would be surprised to see how hard Eugene is studying, if he stops or makes a noise I have only to use the two magic letters D. B. &amp; he will become as gentle as a Lady of twenty five who is in want of a husband. But to change the subject I want you to let me know when you saw B. Sha. &amp; also when you see him next I wish you w'ld tell him not to forget to pay me that visit which he promised. I do not think that I ought to write to you after your writing to know whether you might call me Dear John. I should like to know what you would call me but that. I was so mad when I read that letter that if I could have got my hands on you I most assuredly would have been the death of you. You must not think hard of me if I do not answer all of your letters immediately. I must now conclude as it is time for dinner roll call. Write soon &amp; untill then I remain your devoted friend John C. Stockton P. S.

      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. E. L. C. Harrison,University of Virginia Harrisonburg Sept 17. 1853 My dear Eliza, I wrote to you from Staunton to warn the boys (&amp; others) if necessary, against exposing themselves, should it be true that Mr. Watson's (not Col. W's I presume) dog had run away mad. I hope there is no truth in Miss Terrill's fears on the subjectm yet prudent caution is wise. I stated also that I wished you to inform Mr. Munday that I would wait until I got home to decide about the flour. If you have not yet sent to him, I would rather you should just do what you think best. I dont care for a small difference in the price, even a dollar—and the flour seemed to me to be very extraordinarily good. Suppose you get only four barrels more of the same at present. Of course if you ordered 10 barrels, according to my first directions, the order must stand, and, any way, if you think best you may get yr. supply of this flour. Mother is rather complaining. We had a cold ride from Staunton this morning from 1½ to 6 o'clock, &amp; I think I caught some cold, but am not much affected by it. Mother sends you her love. Yr. husb. affectionately, Gessner Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg Sept 20th 53 My dear son Francis Yours was rec.d today &amp; I hasten to reply by return mail. Your description of the farm in question is so attractive that we have concluded to accept yr invitation &amp; come to see it. We have partially arranged to leave here on the 27th inst. in order to give time to view the premises. I should have to give them a very thorough &amp; carefull examination. You did not describe the woodland sufficiently. It may be rocky &amp; broken. There is a large body of it. Is there any prospect of its going above the 20$. You intimate in yr 1st letter that it could be had at that price. I am writing in the dark &amp; will have to finish in the morning. I have not much to add except to say that the idea of settling my business here, of selling off etc &amp; moving 100 miles to a new country, beginning life anew, forming new associations, a new business etc etc, is rather a heavy job for an oldish body, but then on the other hand to leave old disagreeable associations &amp; a declining business, one that I am tired of, together with enemies envious &amp; malicious, in a place rendered unpleasant from reminiscences of the most offensive character, &amp; having the prospect of the aid &amp; company of my children is encouraging. But this is a strain that I did not desig touching. I wish I could be pleased with the farm. Ellen dreads the country on acct of its loneliness. If neighbors are near it would obviate her objections to some extent. In the mean time I wish you to act prudently &amp; dont commit me nor yourself by any expression of my anxiety for the farm, but let it be understood that I am to be governed by my own judgement am some what of a pretty good judge of farm land &amp; will square my action by my conclusions. Mr. S. Bradford bo.t the Afton farm as was expected at $24.55 so Mr. Broaddus informed me at my request. Gen. Harvie of Richm.d was his competitor, but actuated by the same feeling that I had did not like to press the bidding agst a man who being attached to the premises desired to remain. If I had remained I shou probably have gone to 25 or over. Edw.d will likely accompany me, and there is some talk of Summys coming along. He has consented to go beyond Staunton to take charge of a Lady (the wife of Fenton Henderson) who wishes to visit this place. Her husband being so constantly engaged on the Central R. R.d as engineer is unable to attend her &amp; consequently Mrs. Dr. Lee has engaged S's services for that occasion. Yr requests as to the silver ware will be kept in mind. You say nothing of Marys health. We hope it is good. You speak of having had a spell of Hyppo, yourself. This is a very common occurance to young married folks. I have some experience in those things. The remedy is action, action. Bestir the gift of energy. The man who shrinks before difficulties sinks in mind, body &amp; spirits. He becomes smaller &amp; the mountains larger in imagination. But let him brace himself to the task &amp; resolve to do, raise himself to his utmost stature the mountain sinks &amp; he walks over. Never forget yr Benefactor &amp; ever faithful friend. Serve Him with a perfect heart &amp; willing mind &amp; He never will forsake you, but will lead you on safely. Yrs truly &amp; Aff.y D. G. Smith We all join in love to our dear Mary &amp; yrself.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sherwood Sep 26th 1853 Dear Eliza I send Mamas shoes up by a boy from aunt Carter's, who is going to town to carry his father some clean clothes (a man of Mr. Ben Perkins' in jail) none of our servants seemed inclined to go as they would have had to walk, and this is a safe opportunity. I presume it will not be of much consequence their not arriving early in the day, as I suppose Mama would of course wear her gaiters to church. I wish they were more attentive to requests at Flannagans. The note to you Henry left there early Wednesday morning asking them to send it to you promptly &amp; when B. called for the cloth you had gotten for Tucker, they told him they had sent it to you, though you requested them to keep it. This quite provoked me as I wanted the suit cut out early Monday. I will be much obliged to you if you will send it back to Flannagans, as Mr. Rives will be in town early Monday, but may not have time to go to the U.y, and he can bring it out. I am very much pleased with your selection of a bridal gift, it is a beautiful portfolio. I have written a letter to accompany it this morning, but wish I could have taken it myself. I do not think tho' it would have done for me to have left home at this time. I have a great deal to attend to and poor Tucker continues to suffer dreadfully with his finger. It is the second rising he has had lately. I fear he is going to have a succession of them, and that he will not be able to go to school at its opening. I wish I could be at Mary's nice dinner today. I can fancy how busy she has been. I long to see her in her new home. I am getting anxious to make my fall purchases, and to see you all, but do not know when I shall be able to go up, as the horses have so many trips to make hauling timber, going after wood, and probably two trips to take Henry &amp; Tucker to the U.y and to school. I am truly pleased to hear that Maria continues so well. I suppose she has not yet fixed upon a name for the little girl? Tell Edward he must not forget his promise of putting out some rose slips for me. I shall have a nice little green house under the end of the new porch. I must conclude as it is time I was sending off the parcel. Poor Mildred Perkins is at Dr. Randolph's—what a sad thing the total ruin of this family; servants, furniture stock every thing has been seized and taken off. I feel truly sorry for them. Mathew, Betsey Ann's husband, their dining room servant is a most excellent one. She you know is our Jane's sister-and he is the one to whom the boy is going tomorrow. With much love to Papa, Mama, Maria, Mary &amp; all. I remain truly Your fond sister Maria R. Rives</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia, October 3rd(1853) My dear Mother I cannot let father leave this morning without being the bearer of a letter to you, if it contains only a few lines. I am very sorry that he thinks he must go this morning, for he has been out in the country so much that we have had comparatively little of his company. However he has promised to come again in November, and bring you with him, when he can stay longer, and one of my chief objects in writing now is to beg you to come by all means. We will be so glad to see you. You must not think of coming, just to stay a week or two, for the journey here by the present route is so fatiguing, that I am sure you would need some time just to rest. Since father has actually made the purchase of the farm, I suppose we can offer that as a strong inducement for you to visit us. I am very anxious to see the place myself. I do hope you will be pleased with it. I at least am very glad of the purchase because it will bring you all so near to us. Many thanks to you for the nice sponge cake you sent me, which I assure you has been duly appreciated, and also for the receipts which were very acceptable. I have tried already to make the cake Mr. Smith admires so much, but he said it was not at all right, although it seemed to be very well baked, he said it did not taste at all as yours did. When you come I will try again so that you can tell me where the fault lies. I wish very much that I had your cap to send in the box &amp; I would certainly have had it ready, if Grandma had not given the pattern away as soon as I had finished, thinking I suppose that I did not want it, and the lady to whom it was given left the place while I was still under the impression that it had only been borrowed and would be returned to me. I can easily get it by writing, but still it disappointed me as I wished to do it immediately, and now I must necessarily be delayed. I will certainly have it ready for you in November however. I was very sorry that Summerfield did not come, but I hope his visit is only deferred for a short time. Two of your Loudoun boys from Mr. Minor's school said here the other day that if Summy were only at school with them they would be perfectly satisfied. Tell him and Howard that they must both write to me. I will be so glad to hear from them. I will have more time to answer their letters than either of their brothers. Yesterday our new chaplain Mr. Hanson preached for us for the first time, and we like him very much. He seems to be a plain practical preacher, and very liberal I judge from his appearing in the pulpit without a gown, and speaking without notes, which are two remarkable things for an Episcopalian. The University seems quite alive now, a great many students having already arrived. As it is nearly breakfast time and I am writing in rather a cold room I must conclude with much love to yourself Summerfield and Howard. Give my love to the Miss Clagetts also when you see them. Indeed there are many among the acquaintances I formed during my short stay in Leesburg whom I remember with interest and regard. Your sincerely attached daughter Mary Stuart Smith (To Mrs. Daniel G. Smith—her mother-in-law)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Oct 4th 1853 Dear Bro. Smith We rec.d your last, in which you speak of James, and advised me not to let his course toward me interrupt me, I only have to say that while he chooses to persue such conduct toward me which is extremely disagreable, yet I do not intend to suffer myself to be annoyed by him any more than I cannot avoid. I shall have nothing to do with him, until he acts toward me in a different manner. Hannah says I ought not mind him in his present state of mind, but if he has sense enough to treat others decently he might do the same to me. But I think my best course is to have nothing at all to do with him. I pd. 10$ for him today. We are beginning to feel our summer clothes too cool. We have had some frosty nights. The health of Balt. could not be better than it is, only 66 deaths last week, which is a very small proportion, and what is more remarkable still, Havre de Grace Station has been very healthy indeed. We have neither had sickness nor musquetoes there this year. I go up every Saturday and return on Tuesday, having a class to meet on Monday afternoon at 3 Oclock which makes it too late for me to come home on Monday. But as H. de Grace has very little interest for you, let us now talk about Guano, and really I have very little to write on that score. I have been thinking that you and Ellen would be on to see the Fair which is now going on here. Not the worlds Fair, nor yet a Leesburg Fair, but the Fair of the Mary.d Institute, and then you can get more satisfaction about Guano. It still remains scarce and high. A vessel comes in occasionally with a small quantity of the precious article, but not at all equal to the demand, and the agt. says that they cannot get Vessels to bring it in, and that is the reason of its scarcity. I paid Mr. Curlet (the confectionary) his bill soon after the things were sent, and omitted to mention it in my last. I do not mean by this to dun you for it, but to inform you how it stands. If you do not come on before the 15th Inst. you can bring Mr. Orrs Quarters rent with you. Eliza and I often talk about your pop visits and we want you to give us a longer visit this time so that we may have a little talk about things in general. The man with court house railing says he will keep you advised of his progress in the work. I called to see him but he was not in, and being a long walk I have not time tossee him this morning before the mail closes. Tell Bro Rodgers I saw his Father last night at the Fair, and the family are well. I also saw Wm. there who seems to be getting better health. We are all well, for which we feel thankful to our heavenly Father. We will expect to see you soon in Balt. May all the blessings of Kind providence be yours, and may we all be found faithful servants when we are called to our examination. Our love to all. Most truly M. G. Hamilton N. B. Eliza sends Ellen a strong and earnest invitation to come on and see us with you. Fair and all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg Oct. 8th 1853 My dear Children Francis &amp; Mary I arrived here on Tuesday evening safely. Found all well, &amp; pleased at the idea of getting to Albemarle. We are very anxious to hear from you &amp; know that F. is well &amp; has acquited himself like a hero, &amp; that his debut has done credit to himself &amp; to all connected with him, that he has dismissed all that diffidence &amp; assumed the tone &amp; bearing of a savan. I know that he possesses the qualifications, is competent to all the duties of his office &amp; if there be any faultering it will be in manners which can be overcome. In the presence of his pupils he must assume an affectionate confidence. He will receive the sympathy &amp; good wishes of all the sensible portion of his classes, with this knowledge &amp; these sentiments he can have nothing to fear. I hope all things will &amp; have worked together for good. I have such an abiding confidence &amp; trust in the goodness of our Heavenly Father, that I feel an assurance that all is right. I pray constantly, &amp; daily, for your success, happiness &amp; health. Ellen is delighted with Mary &amp; is much pleased with the affectionate tone of her letters. She will write her soon. So will the boys. I have sold my dwelling to Dr. Mott, including Mrs Hooks lot for 1850$—possession on or before 15th May next. Expect to sell the brick house soon. The Mill &amp; the store also, &amp; Broad Run farm. I will also sell Goshen if a fair price can be had (20 to 25$ pr ) if not I can manage to pay for the new farm &amp; keep Goshen &amp; Leedswood. Ellen is talking strongly about coming out in Nov.r if the weather is good. It is very probable that she will come with me. Summy may come in a week or so. Henry O Clagett wishes to visit Tom at Minors &amp; Billy at Lexington &amp; will perhaps be accompanied by Miss Lizzy &amp; perhaps Miss Julia. They will know when the Dr. returns home, who is now at his Prince George Estate. They wish Summy to go with them &amp; of course he is vociferous to do so. I wish Francis to recollect that if he does honor to his office &amp; boldly &amp; fearlessly discharges his duty, with credit to himself &amp; all concerned, that silver sett talked of may come along sooner than he might expect—in plain English I should take delight in adding it to the former present. I have made a very favourable report here upon Marys housekeeping essay. Tell Edward that he is remembered with all affection &amp; great hopes are entertained of his success. Accept new assurances of our warmest love &amp; affection &amp; believe me yr most affectionate father D. G. Smith P. S. Present my warmest regards to Dr. H. &amp; family. Send me the Jeffersonian.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia Oct 10th 1853 My dear Father I am very much obliged to you indeed for my share of your kind letter which we received yesterday. I had been thinking before that you must be anxious to hear how Mr. Smith passed through the ordeal which seemed to be such a terrible one to him, and determined to write you an account of his success myself, but I do not how it happened that I failed to do so when the time came. I cannot let him say a word about it now, for I cannot trust him to do justice to himself, in anyone else I should almost be persuaded to think it affectation to persist in thinking he has done badly when every one else is so much pleased. I am very happy to tell you, and I hear it from various and good authority that in his introductory he succeeded better than his best friends had hoped he would. Dr. Cabell and Mr. Broadus both came to tell me how well he had done while he was yet in the lecture room. Both of them I know to be true friends, and we can rely at least on the sincerity of their commendations. Dr. Cabell said that all was in the best taste, and even went so far as to say that he had never heard anything superior from Mr. Rogers, but then it must be remembered that he is no especial admirere of Mr. Rogers, and whatever Mr. Smith does at present we cannot expect from him the finished eloquence of a practised orator. Mr. Broadus said that in his soberest judgement he had succeeded admirably, and indeed I cannot find room to tell you of the favourable opinions expressed with regard to it by many good judges. They say all the students were highly gratified, and some admired it extravagantly. One young man said he didn't know what true eloquence was if that were not, for it went right to the heart. Of course I would not repeat all these eulogies upon Mr. Smith to any one but his own father, but I think you will like to hear really what was thought of his first effort as professor by his friends and the public generally, and I do not think I have exaggerated in the least his success. The number of his class is a little upwards of 80. I am sorry to say that his cold has not yet left him, but the cough is better and the soreness on the breast has entirely disappeared. We are very glad to hear that Mother talks of coming with you to see us in November. You must not let her give it out. We shall also be very glad to see Summerfield and the Misses Clagett. Ask the young ladies if they cannot stay with us, we can make room for them without any trouble and shall be pleased to have their company. I forgot to tell you what Mr. Smith told me to say about his lecturing, and you may see how exactly I have obeyed orders. He says he is getting along just tolerably so far, and that is the best he can say for himself, indeed he is about the only person I ever saw whom I thought was entirely too modest. However it certainly is erring on the safe side, and must be more conducive to humility than the opposite quality, let it be possessed in however moderate a degree. One of my ideas has always been that it was unnatural &amp; impossible for a person of superior intelligence to be brought in contact with others without perceiving his own superiority, but Mr. Smith is a living refutation or at least an exception to my rule, for I believe he really ranks himself very low among those whom others think cannot compare with him. At the same time it seems to me a full appreciation of one's own abilities and powers need not by any means involve self conceit, for the knowledge of possessing a gift or talent is very different from being proud or vain of it. For while the native clearness of the mind may make one feel within him the consciousness of genius or high intellectual endowments, still while he views all this as a gift of God and himself as the unworthy recipient of a kind Father's favours, he may at the same time be the most humble and lowly of men. In the same way I cannot believe a very beautiful person can look in a mirror and around them, and be wholly ignorant of their attractions, but I can believe that they may know it and be rather humbled than exalted by it if they view it rightly. But I hope you will excuse me for writing all this, it comes so natural to me to write just what occurs to me at the moment, and then when I think of what I have said I fool ashamed. I have not seen Edward for about a week. I suppose he is very busy getting regularly to work. I shall see him tomorrow however and deliver your message to him. Mr. Smith joins me in much love to yourself, Mother &amp; the boys. I hope that some one of you will always find time to write to us once in a week, or two weeks at most. Your sincerely attached daughter Mary Stuart Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Univ. of Virg.a Oct. 10 1853 Rov.d W. G. Cross My dear Sir, I was not able to read yr. letter until late today, and am abliged to return a very hurried answer. I was taken utterly by surprise by yr. communication, having had no idea of any such question pending. But I am free to say, that from what I know of you, I could not interpose any serious objection to the connection, supposing my sister to have well weighed the responsible position of a Methodist preacher's wife to wh. she would be introduced, and to be prepared to encounter it with full purpose to bear courageously &amp; with cheerful heart its inevitable hardships and trials. With sincere pleasure I have heard of your recovery, and assure you it affordsime pleasure to be of any little service to you in yr. illness, Very truly yours, Gessner Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Oct 11 1853 Dear Bro Smith I intended to answer your last this morning, but yours of yesterday came in before breakfast and you will receive this as a reply to both. Your long desired object, of leaving Leesburg, is at last about to be realized, and we most sencerely hope for your welfare and happiness in the change. There are many things to be considered in making a change of residence, many pros and many cons. You will, of course, find some strong ties in your old associations, and also some strong cords drawing you to the new ones, and the only question to be decided is, whether you are convinced in your own judgment that such change of residence will be to your advantage and that of yr family. In many respects we shall be sorry for you to leave Leesburg, but this should not influence you in so important a matter, and many others may be sorry, and you may be sorry to leave L. yourself. But the question remains to be settled, What will be best for you nad yours, and you must decide this in your own judgment, for none are prepared to decide this matter for you. May an alwise providence direct you in your arrangements as well as your destiny. You have been fortunate in find'g sale for your Leesburg property. I wish we could do the same. I will take six hundred dollars for the Orr estate, possession to be given when his lease is out, and thus join you in "closing out" at Leesburg. Would not Mott be willing to increase his possessions in that way? And as to Dave, I very much regret that he should give you so much trouble. I will bring him to Maryland and hire him out (not in the City) but in the country to some one that will manage him, and if that will not do, I will sell him. I do not intend to have much trouble with him. I suppose you will not be able to get a hand until about Christmas, but as soon as you say I will have him brought away. Eliza is anxious to sell him for a term, but that is not so easy to do, and we must do the best we can with the trouble. I presume there is no demend for Duncans services in Balt. at present. There were some members turned out of the church on Greatfalls Circuit a few weeks ago, and they have been trying to get a South preacher to come and help them make a disturbance. But I am told that there is no wish for a South-down except on the part of the persons who were expelled. I know of nothing on this subject in Balt. We all quiet at Havre. I expect to preach for them there until Con. I go on Saturday and return Monday or Tuesday. As for going South my answer is that Balt. is south enough for me. And I hate that idea worse than any other connected with your removal. Our enemies in Leesburg will consider it a victory. But I should not be influenced in any matter by them, because they are enemies, and enemies by wicked works. We are glad with you that Francis is doing so well. May the Lord be with him and keep him in all his ways. You and Ellen have not said any thing about coming to Balt. this fall. Had you not better! I must close at present. Give our love to all &amp; believe us as ever Truly &amp; aff. yours M. G. Hamilton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prof. F. H. SmithUniversity of Va. Leesburg Oct 11th 1853 Dear Sons Edward &amp; Francis I have just rec.d Mrs. Higginbothams letter of 6th inst. (a good while on the way0 in which she urges me to come on by the 12th inst (tomorrow) to attend the survey of the land &amp; to execute the bonds, to be ready to be returned to court, which she says sits about 15th or 16th inst. When I left Mrs H's it was understood that I should attend the sale of the personalty, which was supposed w.d come off about the last of Nov. &amp; that they were to have the county surveyor to make the survey at the earliest moment, have the plat, courses &amp; distances laid down, &amp; then ascertain the number of acres which when multiplied by $19.55 would give th amt of purchase money. The 4 bonds were to be drawn for the 4 equal amts of said sum, severally at 1,2,3,&amp;4 years, dated on the 15th day of December 1853 bearing interest from date, the int. payable abbually, &amp; that these bonds w.d be enclosed to me by mail for my signature, returned immediately for Mr. George Rives signature &amp; handed to Mrs. H. This I thought was understood. It will be impossible for me at the short &amp; unexpected notice to get out, &amp; I enclose my name to such bonds leaving the amt. blank to be filled up, to be executed by Mr. Rives. This I think will be satisfactory to the court. I have also taken the precaution to send 4 intire blank notes with my signature, so that if those I have partly filled up should not answer, then the blanks can be filled to suit the case. See Mr. Alex. Rives the brother of Mr. George R. who is a practising Lawyer at yr Bar &amp; ask him to attend to this business for me as my representative &amp; tell him that if there is any informality in the proceeding &amp; that if it is really necessary that I should be present, to get the court to make the order, so that I may comply with it when I come out in November. I cant get out now. I have requested Mr. Wood the manager to attend the survey &amp; in conjunction with the adjoining neighbors to fix the corners &amp; mark the lines, &amp; when the surveyor returns his report with the plat, courses &amp; distances etc reference may be made to them at all times to correct any mistake, &amp; should any be discovered (which is doubtful) the court w.d correct the same. I should like to get a copy of the survey plat etc by mail when I hear from you. One of you must give yr attention to this immediately. Whoever may best spare a short time. If the notes partly filled will answer, return the blanks to me, or vice versa, (return the others) enclosed is also a memorandum which you can hand to Mr. A. Rives. I suppose neither of you can attend the survey. Of course I can not request it, &amp; I dont know that any benefit could arise from such attention. Mr. Wood has been requested to do whatever is necessary &amp; even if I should be present I could not interfere in the survey inasmuch as it is done by the other party &amp; it will be for my examination only after the report is made &amp; the papers filed in court. I perhaps w.d make some exertions to get out if there was an indispensible necessity for my presence but intending a visit so soon after to attend the sale &amp; having a multiplicity of matters here calling for my attention I am not disposed to put myself to unnecessary inconvenience. Give to my dear daughter Mary my best love, she being a sharer with yourselves. Yr. Father truly D. G. Smith P. S. This being a business letter I have not much time to talk of family matters only to ass re you all of our continued &amp; undiminished interest in yr welfare. I have rejoiced greatly in the good news of F's success. The Good Lord will continue to bless you. I have sent but 4 blank bonds with my signature. Mr Rives will fill them up, &amp; seed what I think a proper form. I direct this to Francis, who will see Edward if he can not give attention.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Prof. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Wilkesbarre, Oct 11, 1853 My dear friend, I thank you for your kind letter which conveyed the pleasing news of your having passed the always trying ordeal of a first lecture, and of the bright prospects under which the session is commencing. You must expect, for some time, often to fall short of your idea of excellence in the Lecture room. Were it not so this idea of yours would be much less exalted than I know it to be. But occasional imperfections seen by yourself but perhaps not observed by your class ought not to give you concern or inspire despondency. They are part of the inevitable experience of all in your profession who have the sensibility which is necessary to real excellence in the end. Accept my thanks for your attention to the matter of business which is well arranged by a deposit in the Bank at Charlottesville. When I return to Phil. I will draw for the amt. &amp; send you a receipt. The carpet is of trifling value &amp; not worth the trouble of selling. If not in your way you may let it stand where it is or make what other disposition of it you please. I expect to leave the field about the 23 inst. &amp; will spend a day or two in Phil.a, after which I will probably make a geological visit to some Mesozoic localities in Va. While in the city I will endeavour to procure such articles for your Mineral department as may be necessary, &amp; will write you thence on the subject. You will smile when I tell you that I begin now daily to have a feeling as if the College bell were summoning me. Yet with something like a surge of want for the absence of the receding excitement of the Lecture room, I greatly enjoy the liberty I now have to ramble when I choose among the rocks &amp; by the streams of this lovely region. The familiar College scene is now before me &amp; my heart warms towards the kind friends &amp; colleagues with whom I used annually at this time to renew my intercourse. May blessings attend them &amp; the home in which I have dwelt &amp; laboured with them for seventeen years. Please remember me affectionately to them all, but especially to Dr. Harrison, whose true regard I have ever so deeply valued, &amp; to Mrs. H. &amp; Maria &amp; all the children. Mrs. Rogers joins me in affectionate wishes to Mary &amp; send her best regards to you. Again urging you to be of good heart, I remain Very truly your friend W. B. Rogers Kind remembrances to Hougens &amp; Dr. Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philadelphia Oct 27th, 1853 My dear Eliza, I was very glad to get a letter from you at last, though I readily excused you for not writing, as Mary's letter gave me the news of the University. I was very glad to learn from you what she had omitted—that Mr. Smith had overcome his first repugnance to an introductory lecture, and still more that he had acquitted himself in so satisfactory a way. The rest of his path in the session will be comparatively smooth, until he is called upon to punish one of those disorders which always must be expected, with more or less frequency, where so many young men are congregated. The members this year will, I think exceed 450, though fall short of the 500 I supposed they would approach. Mary's articles did not leave Philadelphia on Saturday, as I had expected, but, owing to some delay of the steamer, on Monday last—so that if they were to go to the University by railroad they might get there by tomorrow—but I know not whether that is a safe mode of sending a piano. Mr. Smith, in a postscript to Mary's letter said he would send on the money as soon as he knew the amount. I did inform him of it eight days ago, &amp; have not yet heard from him. This would have been of no importance whatever if I had not on the faith of his letter told Scheer &amp; the curtain man they should have their money this week, &amp; if it does not arrive, I may find some inconvenience in advancing so large a sum. The whole amount was $551.37 but from this must be deducted $7 for the piano cover. Mary wished one of India rubber and they are the best, but they are not made here—but in New York, &amp; those which Scher.r had are a dingy white with faint dingy flowers, &amp; we thought them so ugly that we declined sending one. The black ones are much handsomer—&amp; some one going to New York or dealing there might get her one—but take ear that it is not too small as some here would be. Your mother was taken last night with one of her distressing attacks, &amp; is consiquently very weak today. She previously had a respite of a fortnight—and this return was owing no doubt to overfatigue in procuring a waiter now that Pollard &amp; his wife are expected. I presume you have heard that Maria Hunton has married an old Bachelor of sixty worth two or three hundred thousand dollars. Frank &amp; Ned will now speak more favorably of her. Remeber us to the Dr. &amp; the childred I am Affectionately yours G. Tucker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Nov. 2, 1853 Dear Bro Smith Yours of the 31 came to hand this morning and I have given early attention to your requests. After voting for the Maine Law this morning I went to the Bank drew the money, and paid the following amounts as pr. inclosed Bills &amp; receipts—viz. Whitman $32.75 J. P. Cook 4.25 Janett &amp; sons 21.00 L. Curlett 12.37 Orrs rent 15.50 85.87 By your draft on Bank 85.62 .25 Bro. Jarrett said that he had sold you the clothes as low as he co could make them, &amp; he had you charged with freight 50 cents, which I made him take off, and tried to get him to take off 20$ for the bill but did not succeed. I tried also to get Whitman to take off that 25 cents but he would not. So you see I have done the best I could for you. We were disappointed in not seeing you and Ellen during our great Fair &amp; Cattle show. They are over. Eliza quilted the quilt pieced by Sister Cassa some 20 years ago and put it in the Fair on competition, and it drew a very pretty premium, so conside ed among the Ladies. It was what they call " a card case". She als put in a bottle of Blackberry cordial for which she rec.d a season ticket. I mention this for Ellens information and amusement. Docto Davis was on Sunday last taken with one of his attacks of Rheumatism tism, He is now getting better. We nearly all have colds, but we have cause for gratitude to our heavenly Father for the mercy we enjoy. We have not been able to learn any thing cirtain about the result of the Election here today, but we hope the Main Law Ticket has carried. This was the point of interest to us in this election I hope we shall get the Maine Law all over the country. I expect to take Eliza to H. de Grace with me next Saturday to spend a week or two, and if you conclude to make us a visit this fall let us know &amp; we will be at home. We can hardly say any thing about your going South, but w hope you will find your interest and happiness improved in the change you are about to make. I wish Mr. Orrs time was out so that I too might sell the old homestead as in all probability we shall scarcely ever see Leesburg after you leave. Please put yrself to some pains to sell that for us, as you did the other, and you will confer a lasting obligation. We are glad to hear from you as often as possible. May we all have grace to love God and keep His comma ments, so that wherever we live, or die, we may find a happy home in the Kingdom of Glory. Give our love to all. E. sends her love to E. and all our friends. Truly &amp; aff. M. G. Hamilton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paid 5 Leesburg Va.Nov 5 Mr. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Leesburg Nov.r 4th 1853 My dear son Francis I have not answered your last letter &amp; now wish to do so, or rather to say that you ought to continue to write whether answered in regular order or not. I will not however renew the old complaint of your neglect of home interests, inasmuch as you have so intirely concentrated your affections at another point. I wish however to give this letter a business complication &amp; will at once get upon the course. I will first say that I am somewhat dissatisfied at the delay on the part of the parties concerned in the matter of the reports of sale of Morven. They I understand were not made. Who is in fault I am not advised. I certainly expected to have the sale confirmed in the report at the late session of court Edward says in a late letter that the surveyor had not his report ready. I shall feel reluctant to move out before the sale is confirmed. Please in your next inform me when the next session of yr superioir court will take place. I shall even hesitate to do much upon the farm untill the court acts upon the sale. I had intended to send out during the winter a lot of fruit trees to have a new orchard planted, but will now decline doing so. I expect to come out to the sale, all things favouring my journey &amp; will perhaps get to Charlottesville on the Friday or Saturday preceeding the sale, say the 11th or 12th inst. I forgot to enquire about the prospect of hiring farm hands in your county, the rates etc. If yo have any means by which to gain information upon that subject try &amp; be able to inform me. I shall perhaps purchase at the sale a portion of the servants, but owing to the high preces, not so many as I may want. There is a report here that a considerable decline has taken place in the prices of servants in the cities. I think however that it will be safer to hire hands at 100$ pr An. than to pay 1000$ for them, looking alone at profits, but there are other considerations operating quite as potent. I dont know that I have informed you of the sale of my town property. I sold home to Dr. Mott for 1950$ &amp; the adjoining Brick at 700$. Our stock of goods is being run off at cost etc pretty fast, &amp; I am in treaty for the sale of broad run, &amp; perhaps Goshen may be sold before we leave. I think myself fortunate in the time of sale. Lands are up &amp; wheat etc. all in the ascendant. Our friends express much regret at our contemplated move. I believ many are very sincere. Some have declared a desire to go with us. W. H. Gray said he would sell out &amp; go &amp; thought Albemarle the most desirable place in the State. The Hardings are quite discons late etc etc ad in.— I write Mary a longish letter which I thought would bring a prompt response, in that I have been so far frustrated. I am glad to hear by Edwards letter that your health is improving, &amp; that you are getting on admirably. If your position will promote your happiness and will afford you the means of dispensing happiness to others, and of advancing moral improvement, my highest wishes will be gratified, &amp; the measure of my ambition will be filled. Let your great success stimulate you to greater effort, feeling all the time your dependence upon, as well as your vast obligation to, your Heavenly Father, who has so signally blessed you. Accept my increasing love for yourself &amp; our dear Mary &amp; let Edward share a large portion. from yours affectionately D. G. Smith P. S. More than a month ago I wrote to Mr. R. Colston &amp; have not heard from him in reply. I directed to Woodville P.O. Perhaps I was mistaken. Ask Edward to enquire.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia Nov. 10. 1853 My dear Eliza, Your letter dated the 5th, &amp; postmarked the 9th, reached me today. I had become quite anxious to hear from you, and more than commonly delighted to got your letter. I hope that dear little Bob has quite recovered, and that the rest of the family are well. I wrote a letter to send by friday's mail, but going to lecture hurriedly forgot to have it carried to the office. I hope you received it Monday. Mr. Wilkins arrived tuesday to dinner, and dined with Mr. Smith yesterday. Today Maria came up, &amp; Mr. Smith &amp; Mary joined us at dinner. Mr. W. expresses much regret at not finding you at home. He spoke of going out to Franklin Minor's tomorrow: but I do not know yet what are his actual arrangements. He seems to enjoy himself, altho' I must confess I am rather poor company, worse than common, from my occupation, and from my constant anxiety of mind. Indeed, he seems to be a very amiable gentleman, and easily contented. Cassandra was quite sick yesterday, but is better today. Tom has hurt his hand with a splinter, &amp; caught cold in it. He is suffering with it a good deal, and Joe has to do the chief waiting. He has managed it badly. I trust he may be better by tomorrow. I hope Mr. Rives was much pleased with his visit. The papers are full of laudatory accounts of the great fair. I am not able to take very much interest in them just now. I have hardly time to write more now, having much to do &amp; little opportunity to do it. My cold is almost entirely well. With much love to all, Yr. ever devoted husband, Gessner Harrison I enclose a letter that came today from Mrs. Mason. I will try to make her son's acquaintance as soon as I can. I dont exactly know where he boards: but can find out. I have hardly had any opportunity of knowing new students not in my own School, being so much confined by my duties. I try to be patient &amp; put my trust in a kind Providence: but find the trials of every day as much as I can bear.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Phil.a Nov 11. 1853 Prof. F. H. Smith My dear Sir. Since my return from geological work I have been endeavouring to comply with your request in relation to Chem.s &amp; Blowpipe reagents &amp; apparatus. Bullock &amp; Crenshaw of this City are now putting up a little order which I left with them, including as I think most or all of the articles you will need. Such reagents as are required only with in the state in which the common Apothecaries furnish them I have omitted, knowing that they can at any time be had in Charlottesville. You will see among the articles an excellent form of Chem.l Table Lamp. The whole amt of this order will be something less than $40. B &amp; C will send the package forthwith to their correspondent in Richmond by whom it will be promptly forwarded to you. I think you will find them obliging &amp; prepared to supply whatever chemicals or apparatus you may need. Mrs. Rogers is now in Boston whither I will soon follow her, to spend the early half of the Winter among our New England friends. After that we will move South &amp; will probably remain sometime in Eastern Virginia. I have been recently following up my examination of the Mesezoic rocks of Va in Fauquier etc.-by way of comparison with N. C. &amp; Pa, &amp; have got some curious results. In my wanderings I reached Richmond just as the fair was at its height, took a hurried glance at what seemed to be a very creditable display &amp; hastened away from the overwhelming crowd. I learned with great pleasure that the classes at the Univ: have continued to increase &amp; that the aggregate this year will much exceed that of any former session. By this time I trust the new harness fits comfortably on you. That you keep the traces well stretched I do not doubt. May all success attend you. Give kindest remembrances to Mary &amp; to all in the populous home across the way. Very truly your friend W. B. Rogers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia Nov 16th My dear Aunt I cannot tell you how often I have thought of writing to some one of you, and I feel that I have done very wrong in neglecting to do so, but I hope you will all pardon me, and I shall endeavour to do better in future. It seems to me a long while since we have heard from Harrisonburg, but it may be that you have written and I heard nothing of it, for they often forget to show me letters received at home, or indeed to mention them to me at all. I suppose you know that Ma has been out in the country for affortnight, and just returned Monday. I was delighted to see her (part cut off) at the same time, and Maria staid up here part of the time. Her little baby is one of the sweetest for her age I ever saw. I think her prettier than Eliza although resembling her a good deal. I do not believe I have ever written to thank you for the nice present of jelly etc. you sent me by pa, but I trust it is not too late now, for I assure you they have been of great service to me, and were most acceptable. I like housekeeping very much now. The only objection I have to it is that it occupies so much time and thought, for I cannot bear to expend so so many thoughts upon eating, but I suppose when I acquire more experience it will come more natural and not occupy my mind so much. (same cut off part) time is so limited that I do not expect to see much of her. Mr. Smith's father &amp; brother arrived here Sunday, but they have been so constantly in the country attending Mrs. Higginbotham's sale that we have seen scarcely anything of them. I hope however that they will be here to-day. I daresay you have heard that Mr. Smith's father bought Mrs. H's place, and they expect to move here in the spring. Aunt Mary has promised to pay us another visit, and Ma expects her almost every fine day. I believe Mr. Rodes expects to have some painting done and improvements made in his house, which she wishes to avoid and whenever the work is commenced she will come here. I did not see Mrs. Joseph Stevens, but for one minute on the street. She is the express image of her brother Le Roy, indeed I do not think I ever saw so strong s likeness before between brother and sister. I was glad to hear that Mr. August has been sent to Charlottesville because I believe he is a good preacher and is certainly a most excellent man. I do not know who your preachers are, and would like to hear. We are much pleased with our minister Mr. Hanson, and I believe he gives general satisfaction, although by no means so good a preacher as Mr. Gibson. My piano arrived a week or two ago, and I am delighted with it. Tell Cousin Fanny she must not forget the visit she promised to pay us before Christmas. I hope you will find time to write to me before long, it would give me so much pleasure to hear from you all. I hope Grandma is not suffering so much as usual, as I think we would certainly have heard if she had been sick. Mr. Smith unites with me in love to you one and all. Kiss Willie for me. I should like to see her so much. Your attached niece Mary Stuart Smith (to either Mary Jane or Caroline Harrison in Harrisonburg. E.D.G.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Nov 17 1853 Dear Bro. Smith We wrote last, hows-ever we will not discuss the matter, but try it again. Time is rolling onward &amp; bringing us nearer the close of another year. Perhaps it would well to say that as you are aware of Eliza's views in reference to Dave, (and I dont wish to cross her in regard to him) would it not be well to send home him at Christmas, inasmuch as you do not wish to purchase him for a term of years. We must do the best we can with him, and if you leave Leesburg (as you expect) in the spring we had rather have him here. We are sorry that you find it necessary to leave, for we shall hardly ever get to L. after you are gone, except to visit the graves of our friends who have gone to the better land. I dont know what the church will do without you, unless God shall raise up some one to take your place, for you have been almost every thing to us in Leesburg, and the Lord will, yea! He has rewarded you and will still reward you for it. May His blessing be upon you and yours in making the change of home which you contemplate. I expected to take E. with me to H. de G. last Saturday but owing to the sickness of her Father she could not go. We expect she will go with me next Saturday and stay several weeks. Dr. Davis is getting better, but he has a very bad cough, something like Brother Rosser had. The rest of us are well, which is daily cause of humble gratiyude to our Heavenly Father. I hope you will be able to get a purchaser for Orrs house before you leave. I should be sorry to have it left on hands. Mr. Forsythe note is coming due, wonder if he will be ready! We should like to see you all once more in your old Leesburg home, but we shall be obliged to wait until you get settled in your new place at Charlotsville. E. &amp; E. R. unite in sending their love. Write soon. Most aff. M. G. Hamilton E. R. had her likeness taken for Aunt Ellen, but has no way of sending it. Expected you to take it when you came on.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia Nov 18th (1853) My dear Mother I cannot tell you how much mortified I am at having to send your cap unfinished, after taking such a long time to make it. I must say however by way of excuse that I never could get the pattern until this week, although I sent for it several times. I hope you will not find any difficulty in making it up, or getting some one else to do it for you. All the work is done with the exception of a bow to finish it behind and that I can send soon by letter, and a piece to go around the crown, which I will try to do this morning. Mr. Smith joins me in thanking you for the nice presents you sent us. We have enjoyed the cake very much. We are very sorry that father and Summerfield must go to-day. I wish very much they could stay longer. With much love, Your affectionate daughter Mary Stuart Smith (To her mother-in-law Mrs. D. G. Smith)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg Dec.r 5th 1853 Dear Francis I rec.d yours in relation to Mr. Wood &amp; Higginbotham. I have written to Mr. Wood &amp; given such directions about the matters as I deemed proper. I think Mr. Elmslie G. Higgenbotham a very singular character. I wrote him from your house a very kind &amp; respectful letter requesting him to have the goodness to enclose the F. M. Policy that I might get the description of the property to have it reinsured. I have not yet heard from him, besides he strangely neglects to call on you for the payment I left for him, which he promised to do at his first visit. I w.d like to send 1000$ more, but for the uncertainty of getting it on the note. If you should see him ask if a payment at Christmas of 2000$ w.d be re.d on the Negro note. Having such a considerable interest now in your county I feel restless &amp; anxious to get out &amp; the settlements of matters here seem to drag, though we are doing as well &amp; we could expect &amp; hope to do better in Jan settling time. I told Mr. Wood to hire 3 men hands, good farmers. If you cam by advice or counsel aid him do so. We would like to get the Boy Spotswood, &amp; his sister Lucy, in some good genteel boarding house till we get out that they might learn to wait etc etc. I should like to have him under your man to learn his housewaiting qualities only. Why does not Mary write to us. I think she promised very well. We are well for which &amp; all of our Blessings we try to cultivate greatful feelings to our good &amp; kind God. Yrs truly D. G. Smith P. S. There is a Pennsylvanian Issee by the papers in your town selling fruit trees. If he will plant 50 of the peach trees on Morven around the garden &amp; through it in proper places &amp; warrent them to grow I will pay him in the summer at the rate of 15 to 20 cts each. If Edw.d could see him I w.d like the thing done. Tell E.d to have them assorted of mostly early kind, white red &amp; yellow clings about one half, the other of the best open seed etc. If done not to be pd for till it si ascertained that they will grow. In haste.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University Dec 5th 1853 My dear Mary Jane, I have been intending to write to you for some time, and to-day determined to defer it no longer. I was very glad to see Wm. Stevens and hear particularly from you all Saturday, although he only let us have a peep at him. He gave us the hope of seeing Nargaret and Fannie some time in the course of the winter. Little Williette must be a most interesting child. I quite long to see her. I had hoped to hear that Mother's health was better, but he seemed to think her cold still very bad and troublesome. I do hope she may be better when you write again. I was very glad to find your minister was likely to be so popular and accept able. We have been equally fortunate in ours. Mr. August is a great favorite in town. I got a letter from Mary Harrison Saturday. She expected to be here that day, but finding it would interfere with a trip her sisters wished to make, has postponed her visit to us until just before or after Christmas. Mr. Horace Burnley is to be married to a lady in Greenbriar, and wished the girls to accompany him. The house at Mr. Rodes will not be done until the spring. The workmen disappointed them. I should think they would prefer it so. It would be so very unpleasant to have building going on in the winter. Mr. Bear I believe has determined to remove to Harrisonburg on his father's account, or rather I should say beyond the mountain, for I do not know where he will live. I should suppose Mrs. Bear would di like giving up her comfortable establishment very much. As you may have heard, we have had very stormy times. All the clouds have blown over, and every thing has subsided into its usual calm. Dr. Harrison had a most responsible and disagreeable time. The excitement and anxiety almost made him sick. He is now, I am happy to say, very well, but as usual, oppressed by his troublesome. I do not see half as much of Maria and her children as I wish. Little Annie is a dear lovely little creature, and Eliza becoming more and more interesting. I believe there is nothing in the way of news. Every thing is as dull as possible. The neighbours are, if possible, more unseciable then ever. Mrs. McGuffey is now entirely occupied with her baby, her nurse being sick, and aunt Mobley is gone to Winchester to live with Fannie Magill who is now Mrs. Graham, wife of the Presbyterian minister. We had a very pleasant gentleman staying with us some days from England, a Mr. Wilkins. I was quite sorry to part with him. Mary is just come over to hear the children their lessons. Rosalic is improving faster than Willie I think I must now see what I can get for dinner as I asked an old student (Mr. Castleman) who preached for us last night , to dine with us to-day. With love to Mother, Margaret, Caroline and Fannie, I am your affectionate sister. E. L. C. Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore Dec 7, 1853 Dear Sister Ellen We have not heard from any of you for a good while. I met Mr. Wilder on the street today, and he told me you were all well, and that Bro Smith had been away from Town. I suppose that is the reason why he has not written lately. E. R. sends you her likeness by this first opportunity she has had. She also joins us in sending her love. We have just returned from H. de Grace after a three weeks visit to that place. E. R. says you will receive her likeness as a Christmas gift. Dr. Davis is in bed with the rheumatism. The rest of us are well as usual. We still hope to see you and Bro. Smith in Balt. before you leave Leesburg for Albemarle. Most aff. yr Bro. M. G. Hamilton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia Dec 7th 1853 My dear father Mr. Smith has just received your letter, and will no doubt answer it himself, but as I ought to have written to you so long ago I think I must at least answer it in part. I feel very sorry to appear to be so negligent in not writing, and blame myself I am sure as much as anyone else can do for allowing myself to procrastinate from day to daythe performance of a duty so easy and so pleasant to perform if only entered upon immediately. I think the reason I am so apt to put off letter writing is that it is a thing which does not enter into the daily routine of duties, and I am tempted to delay it from day to day, because other things seem more pressing at the moment, but when the time has insensibly slipped by, and I look back to see why I have not written, I can easily see that I have been greatly. Mr. Smith has been speaking of writing for a week past, and I always think that he can tell you everything so much more satisfactorily than I can, that I like to wait until a different time. Since the troublous times which you were witness to the University seems to have subsided into more than its usual quiet, and as far as I can see nothing seems to be thought of but studying. I suppose you have heard of the fire which took place last Sunday week near here, but as eventually no property was much injured except that belonging to Mr. Morse the keeper of a grog shop, little sympathy seemed to be felt by anyone. I hear however that he is raising a subscription in Charlottesville to rebuild his shop, even getting money from some poor free negroes, under the pretext of requiring charity, while in reality he has become quite rich upon his ill gotten gains, and will feel his loss slightly. Yesterday Ma and I paid some visits in the country, and among others to Mrs. Macon who will be quite a near neighbour of yours. She and her daughters who is a very sweet girl expressed great pleasure at the idea of your becoming a neighbour of theirs, and hoped they would find you sociable. Mr. Robert Carter whom I heard you speak of meeting, has met with a great affliction lately in the death of his eldest child, a lovely little girl of seven years of age. Her parents at first seemed utterly inconsolable, although she seemed to be one of those unnaturally good children who seem to belong more to heaven than earth, and in her last moments gave evidence of her happy destination by forgetting her own intense suffering in comforting them, telling them not to cry that she was going to heaven to see Jesus and her little sisters who died before. This affliction has however brought one blessing at least with it, it has been the blessed means of reconciling the family to Mr. Rives and Aunt Maria with whom they have had no friendly intercourse for ten or twelve years past and I hope sincerely it will be productive of continued good to them all. We were very sorry to see in the Leesburg paper a notice of the death of Mr. Orr's child. I recollect the little boy very well, and feel much sympathy for them. You did not mention in the letter we received to-day when we might hope to see you here again. I thought you intended to come out this month, but Mr. Smith says you have put it off he believes until February. I have been hoping that you would come about Christmas time, and that being holiday time for every body, that you would be able to spend more of your time with us. Mr. Smith talks somewhat of of paying a short visit to New York at Christmas partly on business and partly for pleasure, but I daresay when the time comes he will decline the trip, for he cannot make up his mind to miss even a few lectures. I must thank Howard for his last letter. I have by no means forgotten the obligations I am under to both him and Summerfield, but I hope they will not be ceremonious with me, but write whenever they can. Tell Mother I am still expecting to hear from her. I send enclosed the last piece to the cap. I hope she found no difficulty about making it up. Mr. Smith is now at lecture, but I have no doubt he will have something to say to you for himself With much love to Yourself, Mother, and the boys I am Your affectionate daughter Mary Stuart Smith (To her father-in-law Daniel G. Smith, who had just bought Morven in Albemarle County)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Dec 9 1853 Dear Bro. Smith Yours of the 6th came to hand yesterday. The day before yesterday I saw Mr. Wilder who told me you were all well. I sent by him a note to Ellen together with Eliza Ridgelys likeness which she was very anxious to send to her Aunt, and which she expected to send by you if you paid us a visit during the fall. Mr. W. says the people are very sorry you are going to leave Leesburg. I told him we were sorry too, in some respects, but that we had no doubt it would be much better for you and your family. And we do sincerely hope and pray that all things may work together for good in the change of home you are about to make. Great has been the change which has come over Leesburg since you and I first knew it. I know of no consideration that could induce me to make my home there after you shall have left it. All attraction seems to be withdrawn from it for me,except (as I said in a former letter) the graves of my ancestry, which I shall hope to visit occasionally as long as I can. Not that I do not appreciate the friendship of some few that still remain. How true it is that here we have no continuing City. We lodge awhile in tents here in the wilderness, hoping after a few years to be permitted to cross over into the good land, that land which flows with milk &amp; honey, where I trust we shall all obtain an inheritance incorruptable, undefiled and that fadeth not away. As regards my own movements, I do not know what I may do in the spring, but at present our expectation is that we shall not receive a regular appointment to any field of labor. I do not think my health sufficiently good, nor do I consider Eliza's health at all equal to the exposures of the Itinerancy, and we may probably remain Sup as before. Doctor Davis is now (and nearly always) confined to his bed, and we do not know at what time he may be taken from us. Well now a word about Dave. I intended to say in a former letter that you could consult your own convenience in sending him home either at Christmas, or when you leave in April or May. I do not wish you to send him until you leave, if you find it necessary to keep him until that time. I have no other use for him but to hire him out, which I should do if you send him in the spring just as well as at Christmas. You will therefore suit your own convenience in the matter. I am told that the southerners are not at all satisfied with their new preacher Mr. Cross. You have seen that the property question has been amicably settled with the aid of Judge Mclane, and it is to be hoped that a better state of feeling will be brough to operate between the two churches. Congress has chosen one from each side as Chaplins both being "hards". No more at present. We all join in love to you all. May we have grace to live here so as to live together hereafter. Most aff. yrs M. G. Hamilton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mary S. SmithUniversity of Virginia Charlottesville Dec 13th My dear Mary, As I find that it will not be convenient to me to go to the University to-night I thought I ought to inform you of the change in my plans. Mr. Broadus is not going to the country to-day and therefore I will defer my visit to you until he does go. I shall go to-morrow afternoon to help about the Salad although I think it can very well go on without my assistance. But as I am always ready to go to see you all I shall take that as an excuse to pay you a short visit. I have determined to return home before tea and so miss the party—and the good things. I went to Mr. Flannagan's but found that Mr. Smith had already executed your commission. Your affectionate sister, Maria C. Broadus</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Boston Dec. 20. 1853 Prof. F. H. Smith My dear friend On my return from geological work early last month, I made a selection in Phil.a of such Chem.s and other articles as I supposed you might want, &amp; left an order with Bullock &amp; Eversham of Phil.a to put them up &amp; send them to you. This I presume they did promptly, but not having heard from you on the subject, I think it possible that they failed to comply with my directions. When you have time, inform me if the articles were such as you wanted. Perhaps there may be other matters of Apparatus or agents which I can aid you in procuring here or elsewhere. You know it wi will give me pleasure in any way in my power to facilitate your plans. I was made quite anxious by the first notices I met of the late trouble in Charlottesville; but I am truly glad to learn that it has passed away without any evil result. A Charlottesville paper brings me weekly some of the local news, but I can gather from it nothing of Univ: affairs, &amp; it is best that this is so. But I long to hear something of those social details, &amp; college interests, in which for so many years I was a sharer &amp; in which I would still take a lively interest sympathising concern. Can you not steal an hour from your college tasks to tell me of my old home &amp; of the good friends &amp; neighbors whom we never can forget. Mrs. Rogers sends enclosed a little present for Isabella &amp; by the same mail a picture-book each for Charley &amp; Johnny. She will thank Mary to present them. Give our kindest Christmas greetings to Dr. Harrison &amp; family, &amp; to other friends who may enquire about us. With the best wishes of the Season to Mary &amp; yourself from us both I remain Your friend W. B. Rogers</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Dec 21 1853 Dear Bro Smith Yours of the 16th is rec.d stating that Mr. Orr is inclined to give 600$ for the house, but could you not get him to pay 300$ down and 100$ annually for four years, which you perceive would be 700$. It is doubtless worth it, and would bring more if it were not encumbered by the lease, and I do not think he ought to avail himself of that consideration as it would not be an encumbrance to him. This seems be the best we can do at present. I shall be greatly obliged to you to do the best you can for us, and let us hear as soon as convenient. You are no doubt very busy preparing to remove. We hope you may be favored with the blessing of a Gracious Providence, and all things may work together for yr. good. We are sorry to hear of those twinges of the rheumatism. Dr. Davis is still in his room with it. He has suffered very much. We shall be glad to see you in the City soon. You say perhaps you will keep Dave until April. Very well, that will do as well as Christmas. His year will be up the 1st of April. Inclosed I send Mr. Fs Note, which you will have the goodness to attend to and send the amt. by draft on one of the Balt. Banks. I will enquire about Guano when I go out. Let us hear from you soon. Our love to all. Most truly M. G. Hamilton E. says give Dave 50 cts &amp; charge.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Miss Mary Jane HarrisonHarrisonburg Virginia Univ.y of Virginia Dec.r 21. 1853 My dear Mary Jane, I have failed to write to you, not because I did not have you all in mind, but for other reasons which I have not the time nor the inclination to trouble you with. And now that I do write, the first matter communicated will cause you equal pain and surprise. Our friend &amp; neighbor Mr. Courtenay died this morning about 2 o'clock, after an illness (fever) of only eleven days. He was taken sick saturday last a week, although he had been somewhat ailing before for some days. The first attack which was one of bilious dyssentery &amp; vomiting, seemed to yield to treatment, but the fever which manifested itself, and became typhoid, soon prostrated him beyond recovery. This is an inexpressibly great affliction to his family, to us as his friends, and a most serious loss to the University. How it behooves us to be always ready! You will be pleased to hear, (what is the only thing that, to poor human sight, brings consolation in this heavy bereavement) that poor Mr. Courtenay gave not only in his last illness before consciousness fled, but during the past half year or more in letters to his sister in law, the most satisfactory evidence of a change of heart. He showed a perfect resignation to die, (as he thought from the first bad symptoms he would) resting his hopes upon the Savior's merits. I trust you are all getting on better than when last we heard from you. That Mother is better, and that you are all striving to live daily for a better world. Let us trust to our blessed Savior more—live more dead to the world &amp; above its vanities. You asked my opinion about the tombstones—but I mislaid yr. letter, &amp; cant remember exactly what you said. I think the circumstances of the family hardly allow beyond modest tombstones for our friends. I have thought so from the first, and this is my opinion still. And as for the railing around the lot, I would have that also plain and unostentatious. I would be content with one made of locust posts, some 2½ feet high, connected by neat iron chains. Such I saw in Laurel Hill Cemetery. An iron wrought railing would cost a good round sum of money. And where is it to come from? If the tombstones should be put up, the railing may be left until I consult with you all, if it please God to spare us, when I next come over. Please give my love to Mother, Caroline, Margaret, Fanny, &amp; the rest, and believe me yr. devoted brother, Gessner Harrison</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Philadelphia Dec 24, '53 My dear Eliza, Your letter conveying the distressing intelligence of Mr. Courtenay's death reached me last evening. From what I had previously heard I apprehended that result. Most truly do I lament it on account of his young family, on account of the University, and on account of himself. I have always been on the best terms with him, took a great pleasure in his society and conversation, and in fact I have never known a more right minded &amp; principled man. Whatever appeared to his dispassionate judgment right, to that he firmly &amp; strictly conformed. You are not likely to find his equal in a successor. I apprehend you have underrated the provision he has left for his children—it is doubtless far less than could be wished or than his merits entitled him to, but he certainly could not have spent his income in any year at the University, and must have been worth at least $15,000—and I should hope more. I should be glad to be informed on this subject as soon as the facts are ascertained. Professor of the University here is a good mathematician—but I know not whether he would accept the place in Virginia, but presume from what I have heard him say, that he would not if he could be chosen to the office of provost-now vacant. David Tucker &amp; his family are now here for the holidays. In consequence of an offensive notice by John Randolph of my speech on the Missouri question in Garland's life of him, I wrote to Garland some time ago at St. Louis, and receiving no answer addressed him a short note at Washington. A copy of his answer &amp; my letter are now inclosed, &amp; I wish to take counsel of the Doctor, Mr. Smith, Mr. Rives &amp; yourself &amp; Maria as to the course I should now take. To publish these letters would make known his disparaging remarks to hundreds or thousands to whom they were previously unknown, at the same time it is not easy to submit quietly to injustice when one has the means of vindication in their hands. I have sometimes thought of having a few copies of these letters printed, &amp; communicated in my former district &amp; other places where his notice has been read &amp; understood—but Dunglison thinks that even such a guarded publication would find its way into the papers—and therefore he advises against it. Your mother's health is as it was—her last attack was this day week—she sends you her love. Remember us to the Doctor, the children Mr. Smith &amp; Mr. Broaddus, &amp; believe me Your truly affectionate father George Tucker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Professor Francis H. SmithUnion Place Hotel New York City University of Virginia Dec 25th 1853 My dearest husband I cannot tell you how much I have missed you already and have begun now to count the days that must elapse before your return. I shall certainly expect at least one or two letters from you, and as soon as you can let me know the precise day that you will reach home, that I may have everything ready to give you a pleasant welcome. Our house looks cold and deserted now and I would not have you find it so when you come back. We went to town this morning, and heard Mr. Manning preach. I remembered my precious husband at the communion table and wished that he could be with me. I hope, however you have spent a pleasant profitable sabbath day where you are, better indeed than we often spend when happy in each other's society. To-night Mr. Meade preached for us, his text being the latter portion of the parable of the prodigal son. I do miss you sadly, my dearest, but for so short a time at least, it certainly would be very ungrateful and wrong to repine. I shall try my usual remedy for loneliness, a renewed diligence in work, and I hope I shall not be tempted to wish any of our valuable time to be hastened or shortened when it may be turned to so good account. I felt so lonely yesterday when I heard the whistle of the cars, and knew it was the signal for a first separation between me and my loved husband. I cannot help feeling some uneasiness about your sickness, and so many dangers are travellers subjected to now, that I cannot feel that you are safe until I actually see you again. But I know that such fears are unworthy a Christian, and try continually to think with renewed confidence of the kind providence which has hitherto preserved us both, and being all powerful is fully able to keep you in perfect safety although surrounded by circumstances of peril. I pray that God may keep my dear Frank and return him to me in health &amp; happiness. I must stop for to-night but will try to add a few words in the morning. Good-night dearest. I dare say we will both go to sleep thinking of each other. Your devoted wife. M.S.S. Monday. I have a great deal to say to you, but find that the mail hour has come and cannot run the risk of not sending what is already said. Can you not get a frame for St. Cecelia? Yours most affectionately. M. S. S. I have a great horror of my letter going to the dead letter office. I will write to-morrow again. Monday night. My dear Frank, I am ashamed to send you such a rambling letter. I could not get it into the post-office this morning and feel as if I must add a few words at least, just to let you know that all is well with us. Christmas has passed in a most gloomy manner here as might have been expected, and indeed nothing else would seem appropriate under present circumstances. Sarah Courtenay tells me that her Aunt speaks of returning with you, but I suppose they spoke to you about it in order that you might not pass through Baltimore without their knowledge. I went to see Sarah this evening, and found the whole family wonderfully supported under their heavy affliction. Sunday morning as neither of my scholars were present at Sunday school, I took charge of your little class, and was much interested in teaching them. Mr. Kean was here Sunday and walked home with me from church. He expressed great regret at not finding you at home, saying that he wished to see us in our own home. If you have no objection, when you let me know the day for your return, I can invite and you can ask him yourself I will probably spend several days your absence. I am glad for (torn to get stamp) is so clear, but it must be I am sure the shawl must Ma gave me a very pretty present case. If you could conveniently would it not be wise to get some cards printed for us. Mrs. Cabeal sent us some nice oranges &amp; malaga grapes with jelly etc. I wish you could have been here to eat some, but no doubt in New York you are bountifully supplied with things of every description. I hope taht you are well enough now to enjoy everything around you. I am so anxious my dearest to hear from you, and rather expected to receive a letter to-day. Good bye again dearest. Your affectionately attached wife Mary Stuart Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">New York City Dec 26th (1853) 11 o'clock at night My dear Wife I am elated, elevated, intoxicated, positively drunk with sentiment. I seem to have had a gorgeous dream-an opium-eaters elysian somnolence-to have been treading enchanted ground, where forms of beauty met the eye, &amp; a heavenly harmony enrapt the soul. Handel's sublime oratorio of the Messiah still lingers on my ear, with its sweet melodious strains &amp; its majestic choral symphonies. Never shall I forget this night-the only regret I feel is that you were not with me, (for the pleasure would have been doubled by sharing it with you) and that I cannot telegraph or write you into a proper appreciation of the supernatural power of this grand composition. O, I feel as if I could be eloquent. It would out. Even as I was walking home up Broadway, I threw up my hands, &amp; gave utterance to the " " in presence of the silent walls, which lifted their sombre forms toward the stars. That last chorus-the Amen- when Jullien, the Jupiter Tonans of conductors, rising to full height, as if filled with the lofty conception— threw our his arms &amp; as he brought his baton sweeping through the air, the tremendous burst of praise from hundreds of human voices, seconded by the powerful orchestra-this brought me down feet &amp; hands, and as I rose, I shouted bravo so enthusiastically, that I made a lady just before me jump, as if struck. I really thought, while sitting there, that if the song of the Lamb was so grand &amp; overpowering, when sung by a limited number of imperfect feeble human voices, attended by material instruments of wood &amp; brass, on earth, what will be the inconceivable rapture of that anthem, when hymned by a countless multitude of redeemed sinners, without discord &amp; accompanied by the angelic host of heavenly harpers, in the world to come! May we make part of that chorus!! I could talk to you long on this theme, but must defer it until I see you. I left Washington this morning before day break-came to Baltimore to breakfast &amp; supposing that I had an hour to spare-was leisurely discussing that meal, when, as I was in the midst of two hard-boiled eggs-a voice came on the silent air, which told me, "Eat no more". I was compelled to run with a half a hard egg, sticking in my throat, leaving the other lone one, untouched upon the table. I had a pleasant ride to Phil.a having the good fortune to get an intelligent and sociable gentleman by me. When I arrived in Phil.a at 1 o'clock, finding that dinner at the Girard would not be ready before 2, at wh. time I was to start for N.Y. I concluded cluded to get my hair dressed &amp; to step round &amp; see your Grandpa, altho' I could not deliver your parcel, my trunk having gone forward by express. I found both your g.d parents at home &amp; glad to see me, tho' your grandpa said he would as soon have expected to see the University in Phil.a at this time as me. Your Grandma, tho she complained like Mr. Williamson of being in dishabille, gave me what I call an old fashioned hug-pressed me to stay-or take a lunch-or break bread in some shape. She herself was invited to dine out, &amp; she was particular in informing me that it was at 5 o'clock-so she is in the fashion yet. She showed me her pretty Christmas presents etc, called out her maid or cook to look at me, introducing me as her son in law. The cook stared &amp; curtsied as to a specimen of giraffe. I saw little Miss Dunglison who said her father is ill of gout. Mr. Tucker walked with me down street, but could not let me off withal, Schele-like &amp; scaly-like, indulging in one of his gibes or jokes, whichever you please to think it. Learning that I was going in the Camden Cars at 2 o'clock, 'Aha" said he, ` I see-that's the two dollar line'.* * I am sorry he was mistaken. I had to pay $3. as I expected. Jullien &amp; his whole band are staying at this Hotel, so I shall see the lion in his den. This city &amp; Phil.a have had a gala day from public appearance as I came through. I could not well resist their pressing invitation to spend a part or all of a day with them, on my return. He said he sent Mrs. Broadus some knife-trays &amp; tea a short time since- &amp; also a letter of Mr. Garlands to your home folks, which it was intended I should see-but your parents have not seen fit to allow me to do so. I had a pleasant ride to the city-making on the way the acquaintance of a young Southerner-Mr. Hayden, who has been educated partly in this country &amp; partly in France &amp; Germany. A Virginian by birth, &amp; acquainted with many who have been students at the Univ., &amp; very intelligent himself &amp; a Catholic withal. You may suppose I passed an agreeable time. I am to call on him at the Metropol.n soon. We got here after 7. I had my trunk taken to the Clarendon &amp; went myself directly to the concert-which had already commenced when I entered- &amp; here I am in the 6th or 5th story of the Clarendon, sending to my dear beloved Mary the warmest love &amp; heartiest benisons from the inmost soul of her affec. husband.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Va. Mrs. Ellen E. SmithLeesburg Loudoun County Va. University of Virginia Dec 27th 1853 My dear Mother I was highly gratified at the reception of your long expected letter, and have delayed answering it much longer than I intended. During the first week or ten days however we have all been kept in such a state of apprehension and distress on account of Mr. Courtenay's illness and death, that together with some few preparations necessary for Christmas times, I have been kept in such an uneasy state that I could scarcely enter upon any employment with much zest. Mr. Smith was also taken quite sick Wednesday evening, and was confined to bed for one day, and I was quite apprehensive that he would have a serious attack. Rather imprudently he left home Saturday to visit New York for a few days, chiefly to purchase some apparatus very much needed in his department, and which he thought he could not well obtain through commissioners. I could not help feeling very uneasy about him, but was somewhat relieved by getting a letter this evening written in Washington saying that he was much better at the time he wrote, although he had a chill, with fever afterwa it, the night he stopped at Richmond. I feel very thankful that he seems in a fair way to get well, and that he has escaped a severe illness. Father's two letters to him arrived to-day and as he is to be absent until next week I took the liberty of opening them, although I could not help feeling some scruples about it. I thought however that I had better do so, as they were in all probability business letters that would need prompt attention, and I was glad I did so for I can at least acknowledge their receipt, and promise safe keeping for them. Although I read the letters, I am so stupid and inexperienced about every thing of the kind, I could not exactly tell whether there was any thing that must be done necessarily before his return, but I shall send for Edward in the morning, and I am sure that he will do everything that is needful. I am staying with Ma now because it was entirely too lonely to stay by myself, and besides I am not remarkable for courage and heroism, and do not think I should fancy being in a house alone. At all events it furnished me with a good excuse for returning to old quarters for a short while, and it was only to-day that a gentleman &amp; lady deeing me here took me for an unmarried daughter of pa's and said they knew Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith had called to see them, but did not hear of my being with them, whereupon I made due explanations of co course. This has been the most gloomy Christmas I ever spent. I hope it was far different with you, and that you were blessed with feelings more in accordance with the usual cheerfulness of the season. Mr. Courtenay's death has been a heavy blow to the University as well as to his family &amp; friends. Altogether it is a most peculiarly afflictive dispensation of providence, as far as it regards this world, for all seem to be confident that he has made a glorious exchange, having reached a haven of rest, after a life of more than usual suffering and toil. But when one looks at his family of seven children left without father or mother, and with slender means of support it is enough to make the heart bleed. But God who has seen fit to bereave them soearly of their natural protectors, will undoubtedly be a father to them, and provide for them more effectually than any earthly parent. It is thought it will be very difficult to make an appointment to the chair of mathematics, and utterly impossible to supply his place in all respects. Edward &amp; George seem both to regret much not being able to pursue their mixed mathematics, for a diploma in that school seems to be prized more highly than any other among all the students and it is a high mark for ambition. I was much pleased to hear that some of your friends remembered and spoke of me. I feel much obliged to them for it, and am sure that I reciprocate their regard, for I felt most grateful for the kindness I received in Leesburg, and it would give me great pleasure to meet with many or all of them again. Indeed I liked everyone I saw, for everyone was kind and I had neither time nor disposition to find fault with any. As it is rather painful to my eyes to write at night, and the mail leaves early in the morning, it is time for me to conclude. I have not forgotten that I owe both Summy and Howard a letter, and if I am slow I think I will surely pay my debts, but I hope they will not be ceremonious with me but write as often as they can, for their letters give me great pleasure. With much love to yourself, father, Summy &amp; Howard I am your sincerely attached daughter Mary Stuart Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">New YorkDec 28 Mrs. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Va. Va. New York Dec.r 27th 1853 My dear wife I intended to write to you last night, but found myself too sleepy &amp; the hour too late, when I thought of doing so. I reruned to my chamber, again filld with pleasurable recollections of the sweet strains I had before been listening to. I c.d not resist the temptation to go again to hear Jullien in one of his ordinary concerts &amp; from what I heard I think I shall go every night I am here, except Thursday night perchance, when I wish to go to the Tabernacle to hear Gavazzi's parting lecture. We had a grand treat last night-altho' I was sorry there were not so many there, as I saw at the oratorio the evening previous. We listened to a great many beautiful pieces-&amp; some very grand. I shall perticularize a few. Motte Zerr sang beautifully an aria from Lucia-&amp; a sonnet "where the bee sucks, there such I", which was rapturously encored. I dont think her equal to Sontag, but a remarkably fine singer. The great exhibition quadrille was grand. It embodied the national airs of many countries, " Mourie por la patrie" "the Marsellaise" a chinese H—- gong- Asiatic war song etc. When Yankee doodle was suddenly struck up, the emotion of the auditors could scarcely be restrained, &amp; presently amid the chimes of bells &amp; peals of cannon, burst forth the English "God save the Queen", the audience fairly shouted with delight,- &amp; M. Jullien, lifting his baton, gave us "Hail Columbia" in an unequalled style. The whole vast assemblage rose to their feet as one man, &amp; continued so during the playing of this air. The other remarkable piece was a Christmas symphony by our countryman W. H. Frey of Philad.a, which w.d I think do honor to any composer, at least if played by Jullien's Band. It commenced with a Christmas Hymn &amp; after some other music, we heard the wailing of the wind &amp; a snow storm (it being the night before Christmas), so admirably imitated by the violins that the dullest could not fail to comprehend the meaning, &amp; amid the moaning, a dirge like air, portraying the death by cold of a traveller. Then came the strokes of the clock announcing midnight&amp; presently were heard the jingling of the bells &amp; prancing gallop of the Santa Claus' little team accompanied by a merry little air. Then the team stops, he descends the chimney, deposits the presents, &amp; returns &amp; again the little coach &amp; four trot &amp; jingle on. Presently after sweet dreams, a sound of joy &amp; surprise is heard as from children discovering their toys, &amp; then as they seize them to try what they are, such a piping of whistles, barking of dogs, squeaking &amp; racket was never heard. Presently all is lost &amp; drowned in the grand finale, the Hallelujah chorus. I spent the day yesterday in business-have not met an acquaintance yet. Went first to Westermans &amp; bo.t books-then to Bailliere's &amp; bo.t more-then to Goupils- to Pikes- to Appletons etc I find here not even all the limited apparatus I want, &amp; shall have to order from Europe. I went into some big stores, wholesale stores, down on some of the crooked little streets, where Tuttle I presume gets his, &amp; you cant imagine the number &amp; variety of these evidences of German ingenuity. I am going to Crystal Palace today, &amp; to other places. Ardent love to you. God bless my darling companion. Your husband F. H. Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt Dec 28 1853 Dear Bro. Smith I wrote to you a few days ago in great haste, and do not know what I wrote except that I thought Mr. Orr ought to give $700 for the house. Not having heard from you, I wish to say that if you cannot get $700 try $650, and rather than not sell I would even take $600, which seems to be much less than its value. I therefore desire you to make the best sale for us that you can, as I believe you will. I do not wish to have the trouble of the old concern after you leave, and it will doubtless be best to sell it. Aware that you are very busy preparing to remove I do not wish to give you too much trouble, but by your attention to this small matter will oblige your B. We hope you have had a happy Christmas. Doctor Davis had his usual family celebration on Monday, when all his children and grand children were present to eat Turkey and Oysters and all sorts of good things of the season. On Sabbath (which was Christmas) we had no more disipation and disorder than on an ordinary Sabbath. All was quiet and decent throughout the City. But on Monday last (which was kept as Christmas) the whole rowdyism of the City seemed to vomit out all the abominable wickedness imaginable, and disgraceful as it is to the authorities of Balt. The police force together was not sufficient to keep order, and we are sorry to find rowdyism and violence in the ascendency. Well enough of this. I saw Bro. Hirst of Loudoun Circuit yesterday and among other things, I asked him who he and Bro Hildt thought most probably would be the successor of our Bro Rodgers in L. He says they have fixed upon Felder Israel of Berryville. What do you think of it? He is a clever fellow and no doubt would do well. I was also talking with A. A. Reece P. E. of Rockingham and he thinks he has one in his District that would suit well. So you see we are calling attention to the subject of a preacher for Leesburg. We hope the good Lord will be favorable and raise up some one to take your place when you are gone, but the prospect is dark and gloomy. And we also hope you may be made a great blessing where you are going. In my last you received Mr. Forsythe first note due Jan.y 1st, which you will be good enough to collect and forward the amount. I am told that the south have a poor concern of a preacher You recollect some time before their conference Charley Davis and Presiding Elder Carter come ove to Balt. Co. and formed a class, yea a circuit, called Howard Circuit, and you have no doubt also soon that the Va conference refused to send a preacher over here to starve. And thus their attempt at disturbance went for nothing. I hope since the property question is settled that all strife will cease. I will attend to the Guano and let you know in my next. E. joins in love. Truly &amp; aff. M. G. Hamilton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">New York Dec 30th/53 My dear wife Your letter(the one to care of Westerman &amp; Co.) reached me this morning, I have sent a servant to Union Place Hotel for the other. It gives me great pleasure to read your assurances of love &amp; remembrance, to think that there is one heart wh. beats for me, tho' it be 500 miles off, while I am surrounded here by thousands of strange faces, persons who know nothing &amp; care less if possible for your little husband, &amp; who wd. not miss him, if he were suddenly snatched from life. I have always thought the crowded city a more gloomy solitude than the barren desert, just in the proportion that the men who dwell in the former are superior to the beasts who inherit the latter. The clerk just tells me he has sent a letter to my room &amp; I must stop till it come back &amp; then see what it contains. Ah! I see from the direction it is not from my dear wife, but from Albort Hunt. He wishes to come, but my letter did not reach him in time to allow him to answer me. I spent yesterday partly at the Crystal Palace, &amp; partly down town. The former is pretty much as we left it. Many article have been removed the most noticeable thing I saw was the Sevres china, painted quite handsomely, but not as striking as I expected &amp; the tapastry from Gobelin-which is exquisite-the most beautiful landscapes &amp; figures worked with thread &amp; from behind. Also a St. John done in Mosaic, wh. is worth $60000 &amp; wd deceive almost any one into the belief that it is an old oil painting. I have little to tell. I had a sleigh ride yesterday of 2½ miles for which I paid the exorbitant price of six and a quarter (not dollars bu cents). Sleighd are jingling now right merrily. I wish we had come to the Clarendon last summer. Much love to you, dearest Affectionately yours forever F. H. Smith (have seen another pretty girl in calico)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Margaret F. StevensHarrisonburg Rockingham Cty Virginia University of Virginia Jan My dear Sister Mag: Many thanks for the kind letter you sent me. I intended answering it before I left home, but there was so much company and confusion that I found it impossible to write with any degree of pleasure, &amp; defered doing so until I should come here. In coming down I took cold &amp; have been suffering so much that I could not attempt writing, &amp; even now I am so nervous that I find it very difficult to compose myself sufficiently to write. I hope my appology is sufficient with the promise that your next letter shall be more promptly attended to, should I not again be wholly unable. I came down with the children &amp; Charlotte a week ago on yesterday, found all very well. The day after we came I spent with Mary, together with Sister, &amp; Maria, but was suffering so much that I had to lie down the greater portion of the time. Mary had every thing in the nicest order, &amp; a very nice dinner. Maria thinks she (Mary) takes more pleasure in her housekeeping &amp; succeeds better in many things than she does-though in the beginning all the prophesies were in her favor. Mary I think is looking better than I ever saw her, &amp; seems perfectly happy. Maria is looking rather lean, owing I suppose to nursing her babe. She has had a good deal of trouble in getting a cook, &amp; had to nurse both of her children for several days &amp; let Martha go in the kitchen which she said had almost broken her down. Little Annie Harrison is a remarkably sweet little creature—her features are not very symetrical but her expression of face is so sweet and gentle. Lida I merely saw, she has the whooping cough &amp; I feared so much that my children wd. take it that we left instantly upon her coming into the room. She is looking very fat &amp; well. Maria says however that she is sometimes very sick at night, &amp; is very troublesome. Tho' tis said to be a very mild form of the whooping cough there have been several deaths in Charlottesville from it, &amp; I cant fully get my consent for the children to have it, &amp; will use every precaution to prevent their having it, &amp; if after all they have it &amp; it should prove serious I cannot charge myself with bringing it upon them. I feel that I will be perfectly resigned to whatever fate Providence may allot to them knowing that so long as I trust in God all must work for my good. A gloom still hangs over the University because of Mr. Courtncy's death. Sister says his family bear it with remarkable fortitude. What a comfort it must be to them to have such an assurance of his happiness as he left. My heart is touched with deepest sympathy when ere I see his little boys, they seem so unconscious of their loss. They are staying at Dr. Howard's. Mrs. Cabell &amp; Mary McGuffy are all of the University Iddies that I have seen. Mary asked me to go with my work &amp; sit with her in her room. I think I will do so before long. Mrs. Cabell seemed to appreciate my every feeling, &amp; said it was that which had kept her from coming before when I have been here. On yesterday Sallie Stevens &amp; Ginnio Miller called to see us. Lucy &amp; Mary Bell came up to the Rotunda; but did not come here. Sister as yet has not had it in her power to call on them. I fear that I shall not be able to get to see them at all. Suffering as I do, I think I would not be justified in attempting the walk down. Sallie &amp; Ginnie were looking very well. John Harris has had another call to Richmond- he was here on Saturday evening after dining at Mr. Maupin's. I thought I never saw him looking so well. Tis said to be the opinion of most persons that Ginnie will never marry him. Mr. Hart a brother of Mrs. Addison Maupin's is said to be very much in love with her. It seems hard that he should be treated thus after such a manifestation of his love for her, but tis the fate of many. He told us that Mother was in her usual health when he left Harrisonburg a week before, but since then Brother received a letter from Sister Mary saying that she was more ailing. I am sorry to hear of it &amp; sincerely hope she is much better ere this. I wished very much that I had a letter ready for him, to have carried you; as he kindly offered to carry bundles or messages—he said he would go to see Mother &amp; let her hear from us. I hope he did so. Minnie &amp; Lucy trouble me so that I scarcely know what I am writing about. Charlotte is out &amp; while I was getting Lucy from the fire Minnie thought she would write a word to you &amp; blotted my letter. She sends her love a kisses to you &amp; Williette. She was wrapping up a needle for you too, but unfortunately she broke it. She says I must tell you she's mighty sorry. How is little Villiette getting on? Does her hair curl now? Tell me all about the nice things you have made for her. Does she wear drawers yet? Kiss her many times for me &amp; tell her I'm going to take Minnie &amp; Lucy ever the mountains to see her. Give a great deal of love to Mother, Sister Mary, Carrie, &amp; Fannie &amp; Mr. Stevens for me &amp; accept for yourself the best wishes and sincere love of your deeply afflicted Sister Mary N. B. How is poor Mrs. Logna? Do you know if she ever got the letter I wrote for her? When you see her again please remember me kindly to her, &amp; tell I would be glad to hear from her if she can have the courage to write. Writing sometimes relieves my heart of its load of sorrows as much as any thing else. Do excuse this scrawl. I am really ashamed to send it. Writing by candle light with children around I find is any thing but agreeable.</field>

Smith We rec.d yrs of the 3rd with the notes of Mr. Orr and also a draft for 306 dollars including the $106 of Mr. Forsythe and $200 as Mr. Orrs first payment, and we this morning rec.d yr note enclosing the Deed, but its now entirely too late to have it executed in time for this Mail, and I will attend to it so as to send it by the next. I shall expect Mr. O. as a matter of course to pay up the rent to the 2nd of January, which will be about 2½ months amounting to $14.60. And you will accept our thanks for your kindness. We believe you have done the best for us that could be done under the circumstances, and it is a consumation long desired by us, as you very well know. And yet there is something that seems to draw about the heart in parting with old friends. Well I suppose this is the nature of this state of being, changes must be made continually. I saw Bro. Rodgers when he was here a few days since, and part of our conversation (as you might suppose) was in regard to the change you are about to make. He is doubtless one of your warmest friends, and while he regrets most deeply the loss the M. E. C. in L. must of necessity suffer in yr removal, yet he thinks it will decidedly promote the comfort of your family as well as that of yourself, and that you are doing wisely having as good opportunities for doing good in Albemarle as in Loudoun, besides having your children under your own suppervision and within your influence. You must excuse scratching as I am not prepared to write a long letter, and shall send something by the next mail. E and her Ma are at Mr. Mullers who married Mary C. E's next sister. She had a Son this morning before day. Our love to all. More soon Most truly etc. M. G. Hamilton We have very bad colds, but we feel thankfull to our Heavenly Father that we have been spared another year.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sherwood Jan 7th 1854 Dear Eliza I got a letter from F. Gwathmey yesterday giving me the very pleasing intelligence that she would come up in the cars to Charlottesville next Monday. She spoke of writing to you and asking the favor of Dr. Harrison to meet her at the Depot. I shall take an early breakfast and certainly be there myself by the time they come in, so that if Dr. H. goes down he must not get a hack. If I should by chance be a few minutes later than the cars, they must not think I am not coming, but go to Mr. Broadus and sit with Maria until I do come. I will carry F. and her little boy to the U.y, and we will remain that day and night with you, and come out to dinner the next day. I really feel delighted that at last I am to have Frances with me. Dr. Brainerd would not come to C., and he would have left Richmond before I could get there, so that his remedy with me must remain untried. I have a sort of conviction though, that it would have been of service to me. I am thankful however that my eyes are getting a little better than they have been. I ought before to have thanked you for the pretty little pickle knife &amp; fork you sent me, it was what I wanted. Tucker and Rosalie were very much pleased and obliged to you and Mary for the books you sent them. Tucker covered his, and took it to school. R. says you certainly did get a very pretty one for her. She is reading it now to me, and seems to be much interested by it. I take the same view that you do of J. Randolph's remarks. His ill nature was so well known &amp; prejudice so strong that no one would much regard remarks made by him. At the same time, I think it will be very well for Mr. Garland to suppress the passage in future additions and he need not have put it in the first. My closet has only been completed today and after breakfast I shall have the agreeable task of arranging it. That meal is now ready and I must conclude with love to all Your fond sister Maria R. Rives</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Va. Jan'y 9th 1854 Dear Father Your letter of the 4th inst. came duly to hand. Francis had already sent the money to Mr. E. G. Higginbotham, who I suppose, will acknowledge the receipt in the course of a day or two. He sent it the day before your letter arrived. I shall try to have an eye to the Guano. I saw Mr. Wood a few days ago. He came to get your name to some notes of hire. Francis not being at home, at the time, &amp; the business seeming all to be straight, to avoid trouble I took the liberty of putting your name to them myself. F. H. S. gave me a check on the Farmer's Bank in your name the other day for 80$. I did not want so much, but he wanted to borrow some &amp; I thought that as the money was drawing no interest in the Bk. a small sum w.d be as safe in his hands as in the Bank &amp; much more convenient to get at, when I shall need it. There was nothing special, I believe, which it was desirable for the bor to contain. I am afraid my calculated expenses for this year will fall below the actual. I left so many clothes to be bought &amp; the books necessary for Moral Philosophy exceed what I thought they would cost by so much—that I begin seriously to think my expenses will not much fall below those of last session. Sister Mary &amp; Francis are both very well. Ditto for myself. I will write to Summy as soon as possible. Love to all. Yr. affectionate Son Edw.d B. Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University Jan 12th 1854 My dear Mary Jane, I have been for many days intending to write to you, but as usual some unforeseen circumstances have prevented my doing so. I was much obliged to you for your kind letter, which contained many things I wished to answer immediately. I have greatly regretted not being able to call on the young ladies at Mr. Stevens'. The weather has been such as to preclude walking To-day I intended going down, but yesterday it commenced raining violently and continues to-day, so I shall be prevented some time longer. Mrs. Stevens and Virginia Miller called to see Mary and myself yesterday. The girls accompanied them to the University but were too ceremonious to call on us. I feel a little curious to know how matters stand with Mr. Harris and Miss Miller. He called to see us, and looked very well and cheerful. I never saw her look prettier than she did yesterday. I believe she is a good deal admired by some of the students. Mary, Minna and Lucy have been with us since Tuesday week. The children are well. Lucy is a very sweet pretty little creature. She is getting over her shyness almost entirely. Minna roads very well for one of her age &amp; seems fond of her book. Mary is still very delicate. She is a good deal complaining to-day. She talks of taking lessons in Frendh and music to enable her to instruct her children. I think it a very good idea. It would divert her mind from her own cares and sorrows, and furnish her an object of interest to occupy her. Fannie Rodes and their governess, Miss Sherman from Vermont, came down Saturday last to see the University. It was however so very cold, they declined visiting the Rotunda, preferring to do so when the weather was milder. Miss Sherman is a pretty young girl, of very genteel manners and doubtless well qualified to teach. The family seem much pleased with her. Mr. Rodes thinks of taking a few bairders. I am very sorry Eliza has the whooping cough. Mary would like to pass some of her time with Maria but is doubtful about the propriety of letting her children take the disease at this time of the year. Eliza is getting on remarkably well with it. We had an unusually dull Christmas with us. Indeed such a gloom was cast over the whole community by Mr. Courtenay's death that it disinclined every one to enjoyment of any kind. His family will remain until the spring, when they will remove to Baltimore to reside with their uncle David Courtenay. I believe he left enough to support his family, with economy. You have of course heard that Mr. Nelson is appointed to take charge of the senior classes, and Mr. Dinwiddie the junior. This is only a temporary arrangement. Mr. Venable is one of the most prominent candidates for the professorship. I am very glad to hear there is a prospect of our seeing Caroline this winter. We should be truly pleased to have her with us whenever she is disposed to come. You made some enquiry ab about mama's health. She is pretty much as when she left here. She has a new physician who gives her more encouragement. Dr. Page, her former one, I imagine has given up practice, as he has come in possession of several hundred thousands. She has a friend and relative of hers, a Miss Smith, living with her who is no doubt a great comfort. Papa spoke very highly of her. Mr. Smith called to see them, on his way to New York. Papa and Mama were going to dine out that day. I am very happy to hear you are so much pleased with your new preacher. We heard a very favorable account of him. Mr. August is much liked in town. He is now gone to see Mr. Johnston married, to whom I know not, not being able to get to town I know very little of the news. Tell Fannie poor Mrs. John H. Bibb is perfectly deranged. She has been taken by her friends to the Baltimore Hospital, There being no room in Staunton. It is a most melancholy circumstance. She has a family of most interesting children. I trust indeed she may be restored. Mr. Broadus and Maria passed a few days with her before Christmas. They were quite persuaded her mind was then in an unsound state. She was very kind and insisted on making many presents to Lida. I am nearly through the troublesome job of putting away my pork. Through a mistake we have a double quantity, which has been quite a labour. It is said we are to have Ole Bull, Strakosch &amp; Signirina Patti to perform in the town Hall tomorrow night. It will be a great treat no doubt. Mr. Smith was enchanted with the music he heard in New York. He bought some very handsome engravings, and beautiful drawings of various kinds. The engravings are handsomely framed for the parlour. From what you said I flattered myself Mother was better than usual. My best love to her, Margaret, Caroline and Fannie. Kiss Williette for me Your affec.te sister, Eliza</field>
      <field name="fulltext">(Jan 13 1854) Sherwood Saturday m.g Dear Eliza I have just received your letter and write you a few lines by the return of the mail to explain why you have not yet seen F. Gwathemey and myself. Last Saturday I got a letter from Frances, saying she found she had been too hasty in fixing upon a day to come up, having some matters which would still detain her, (though she hoped but a few days longer) in Richmond. I wrote her that the cars now passed the U.y so that she need not get out at the Depot and that if she would write you when she was coming that you and Dr. H. would be in waiting at McKennie's Book store to receive her. As E. Douglas will be coming home the middle of next week I suspect she will come at the same time. She said if it was agreeable to us she would like to bring little Frank Moore also with her which I of course most willingly consented to. Dr. Brainerd I see is coming to Charlottesville next week. Mr. R. and I intend to go up Tuesday to see him and hear his lecture that night in the Baptist Church. You voteries of science will no doubt be much amused at our faith and credulity. But what cannot do harm is worth trying if it may perchance do good. I hope F. will arrive to come out with me the next day. How I envy you the treat which no doubt you will enjoy tonight in attending the concert of Ole Bull in Charlottesville. The horses have gone to Scottsville and the roads are torrible or I should have begged Mr. R. to have sent me in today. The arrangement made to fill the chair of Mathematics is no doubt the best till the end of the session. I hope with you that Mr. Tutwiler may get the appointment when one is made. I am sorry you have been so late in getting your pork. There is so much more risque-that it may be injured by the fly when it is not completely cured by the time they first make their appearance in February. I must conclude as to Carter's Bridge is a long walk for our mail boy Isaac to take after dinner. Remember me to Mrs.R. Harrison and all the rest around you. I hope Papa is well. I fear he has one of his colds or I think he would have written to me this week. Your much attached sister M. Rives</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg Jan 17th 1854 My dear son Francis I herewith enclose a Bank dft on the Exchange Bk of Alex for 2250$ it is endorsed with my name, payable to Raleigh Colston Esq.r. It is designed to pay the 3d instalment upon my purchase f from him of his Fauquier farm, which w.d fall due on 1st April next, but which he intimated to me in a recent letter that he w.d receive in advance. I enclose also a recp.t for him to sign, presuming however that your time is too much taken up in your school, I have also written to Edward by this mail directing him to take the dft forthwith &amp; ride out to Mr. Colstons &amp; pay him &amp; take the rep.t. Get him off at once as the interest will accumulate by delay. The amt of payment is 2000$ with int. from 1st Jan 1852, which at 6 pr ct int to the say 20th inst will be $2246.66, so that Mr. C. will pay Edw.d $3.33 in cash if it is pd on 20th inst. or at the rate of 33 1/3 cts pr day more or less. The amt of payment bears 10$ pr. mo. int. or 33 1/3 pr. day. So that the 2250$ w.d pay to the end of this month. If Mr. Colston has provided himself with a loan as he said he w.d do if I did not send this, and refuses to take this now, he must reendorse the dft to your credit, &amp; then I wish you to exchange it at the Far.rs Bk for a dft on Richmond, which dft you will please endorse "Pay to Elmslie G. Higgenbotham Com.r of court on acct of D. G. Smiths purchase of servants etc." and enclose it to him at Richmond at once, directing him to pay of off the larger note, the balance of which is 2000$ &amp; some int. &amp; make the statement on the back, &amp; enclose it to me. Also to apply the leal of the 2250$ towards the payment of the joint note of myself &amp; Rob. Hill Carter &amp; send me a re.pt of the amt thus credited. These directions are full—perhaps more so than necessary, but as you are inexperienced in some things it is well enough to be very specific. It is not likely that Mr. C. will refuse, but it is well enough to have another place ready in case he does. I have got through my store pretty nearly, leaving but about 500$ worth on hand and going off daily. I shall try hard to get out in Feb. to your court, if the weather is very good. I have not yet learned when the session commences. We may be able to move in April. I have not yet sold either of my farms &amp; fear that I shall not be able to do so soon, as at present advised. I will go on and advertize B.d Run at Pub. sale to be sold probably in March. Goshen I may hold on to for a longer time. It will pay well to keep &amp; I may if I sell B.d Run be able to get on without selling it, provided the crops &amp; prices are good. We want to hear from you about yr N. York trip etc. I hope all is getting on well at Morven &amp; that you and the family are well. We rec.d pr Summy &amp; How.d Marys last letters. You will please reassure her of our increasing attachment &amp; love, &amp; thank her for those very appropriate and affectionate letters to the boys. Yrs affectionately D. G. Smith The rept enclosed has a blank or two to be filled up.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Jan 19th 1854 Dear Sis Ellen We received Mr. Smiths letter this morning informing us of the death of Aunt McCabe. Knowing her extreme age and feebleness we were not much surprised to hear of her death, as we have been looking for it for some time. To her the change was a happy one, as she was fully prepared, and waiting for the message "It is enough, come up higher" and now doubtless mingles with our loved ones (so may of whom are gone before) in that bright world, where "Not the slightest touch of pain, nor sorrow's least alloy, can violate our rest or stain, our purity of joy". Our loss is her eternal gain. May we so live through divine grace, that when we die we may all meet in heaven. Mr. H. has been indisposed for several week past and for the last week has been confined to bed with what appeared to be a bad attack of the Piles, but it has proved to be an Abscess in the Rectum. He suffers a great deal of pain and will continue to do so until it comes to a head and discharges its contents. The Drs. say there is no danger from it, but it will be tedious, as it takes some time for them to gather, and will be some time in healing up. This accounts for his seeming neglect in not attending to the Guano, as this alone has prevented him. I am much obliged to you for your advice to him in regard to taking an appointment. I believe that he had made up his mind not to travel next year but if there was any doubt on the subject, this indisposition will settle it. He now says he will not take an effective relation this Spring. The book store alluded to, was one of the topics of conversation when E. Fox was here, but whether it will ever be any thing more, will be for the future to develope. Pa is still confined to his room. Sometimes worse and then better. He is better today than he has been this week. E. R. has a cold. The rest of the family are well. It is getting late, and Mr. H. requires my attention, and I must draw to a close. Write to us soon. Our love to all. Aff. and truly E. P. Hamilton (Mrs. M. G. Hamilton to Mrs. D. G. Smith)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Jan 24th 1854 Dear Sis E. I wrote you last week informing you that Mr. H. was confined to his bed with an abscess in the rectum. It is not in the rectum but near it. It was lanced on Sabbath morning and has been discharging ever since. He suffers no pain from it now but it is very sore. We keep much and fat poultices constantly applied. They soften the part and keep the pus running. He is better but very weak. The Dr. says with care in ouring this up, he hopes he will have much better health than he has enjoyed for some time. It is very slow in healing up and will probably confine him to his bed several weeks longer. We hope you are all well. Did you get my letter. Write to us soon. Our love to all. In great haste yr aff Sis E. P. Hamilton (Mrs. M. G. Hamilton to Mrs. D. G. Smith)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg Feby 4th 1854 My dear son Francis I rec.d yours of 1st today, and am glad that you have resolved upon reformation in letter writing as you say, begining with a new month. I have a great deal of correspondence on my hands about this time, but manage to get a letter to you or Edward about once a week. I now on Saturday night am answering yours in my warm room. I enclose to you a dft on the Exchge Bank at Alex.a for 1000$ endorsed to your use. You will please deposit it in the Far. Bk. to my credit as usual, unless you may have use for any part; then the bal. can be so deposited. I wish to send another in a week or two, so as to have enough soon to pay the remainder of the large note, uponwwhich we have already pd $4,575.00. There remains 2000$ of the principal, with some 50$ or more int. Did Mr. Higgenbotham authorize you to deposit the 3000$ to his credit? or did you send him a check? You do not say, and as I keep no record of my letters I have forgotten my specific instructions to you. I wonder what Mr. Wood is doing. I do not expect to get out to your court next week. There has been so much alarm of late in our town on acct of several recent fires, the work of incendiaries no doubt, that we do not like to be from home &amp; Ellen objects to my going. I need not say that I regret this, to me, disapointment, but there is no real business necessity to call me there. I wrote to Edward, &amp; requeste him to act for me in certain contingencies, which however are not, I think likely, to happen. He will advise with you upon the subject. Mr. Wood informed me that the money for those cattle he bo.t will be due at your Feb. court. Please pay it about 40$ more or less. You make our an indefinite allusion to a remark of Mr. George Rives, the force of which I can not apprehend. While I confess to a rather unsuspecting and confiding trust in my fellow men I think I have sufficient penetration to prevent imposition. I can not call to mind what act of mine Mr. R. could have had in view, which would justify his remark. I shall however be thankful to him or any other friend for timely hints, having for their object my good, and so far as my acquaintance extends with Mr. R., I believe him to be sincerely my friend, and for this high favour, I feel indebted to you, my son. By your noble conduct you have shed lasting honour upon your connexions. Of this I am proud. I regard myself wholly a child of providence, and while I may have been more prosperous in life than many of my compeers, it has not been because of any innate, or acquired, wisdom or foresight sight, but more by the impulsive prompting of that good overruling &amp; superintending providence which I always delight to acknowledge and for which I constantly endeavour to cultivate the deepest feelings of gratitude. We are every day doing something having reference to our expected move to Albe.e. I suppose we have not over 200 or 300$ worth of our store goods left on hand. Summy &amp; How.d are delighte at the prospect of a release from their clerking duties. H. is now going to school. S. is looking rather thin &amp; delicate, otherwise w.d try &amp; get him to school for a few months. I am the more anxious to get on the farm on his acct where he may have the full benefit of the free range of the country, &amp; exercise to strengthe him, before entering fully upon a course of study. He is growing very fast. We may get out in April. I think we shall be able to settle our accts &amp; business in all of Feb. &amp; Mar. We expect to spend a week in Alex on our way to purchase furniture etc. We are negotiating for a fine new carriage, which took the prem. at our Ag.r exebition, (400$). I expect to send out some 6 horses, wagon, with head of sundries etc etc in this month. I have ordered 4 tons more of guano from Richm.d which will be in C. next week &amp; I wish Ed or you to buy my clover seed in C. Get some good farmer to judg for you of the quality (15 Bus). Perhaps Mr. Wood is a good judge. About the Housekeeper. Your Ma says she is not in haste, but you can continue to make inquiries about one. I think it w.d be pleasant to have a good matronly old lady, to give us company etc. The boys will perhaps be off at school &amp; we two old folks may be lonesome, &amp; perhaps be immercifully troublesome to you, for we should, of the country is too lonely, call often to spend a few days by way of variation. Tell our dear Mary that we are feeling stronger attachments for her daily, and her Ma here talks perhaps more about her than any one else. We anticipate much comfort &amp; enjoyment from her society. Give her our best love, &amp; accept for yourself a large share, and to Edward not a small portion. Truly &amp; affectionately yr Father D. G. Smith P. S. Please acknowledge the rept. instanter &amp; say about the action of the court.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">February 9th 1854 My dear Mary Jane, I have been intending for the past day or two to answer your last kind letter, but I have been more than usually hindered, in consequence of several cases of sickness in our family. Edward has been sick for a week, but is now, I am thankful to say, getting well. He intends dressing himself to-day. He had a bronchial affection &amp; his liver was somewhat deranged. There is such a tendency to Pneumonia, that I feel grateful indeed that he should have escaped a severe attack. Tom has not been so fortunate. He is now very sick with Pneumonia, brought on no doubt from a neglected cold. Servants are so stupid. They will not tell very often that any thing is the matter with them until they are almost in the article of death. I hope he may not have a long attack. I was truly pained to hear of poor cousin Frances Hunter's low condition. One can only hope she is now released from her life of trouble and sorrow. I trust aunt Baxter is well, and that she has abundant consolation from on high, in this her time of heavy affliction. Joe Rice told me they had but recently heard of his uncle John Baxter's death, though it occurred so long ago. It seems true indeed that afflictions never come alone. There is a great deal of sickness about here. I hear of many cases of Pneumonia—seems the prevailing disease. The panic about small pox is subsiding, but numbers have taken the precaution of being vaccinated. Minnie and Lucy were vaccinated a second time. It did not take the first. Mary and her children left me Saturday last. Unfortunately Caroline's letter arrived the day after they went away so she must not be surprised if Mary should not get it for a week to come. The mail only goes once a week to Millington. I was very sorry it did not come sooner, as I wished to hear from you all very much. Poor Mary went away very unwell. She had taken a walk from town the day before, which was too much for her. I consider her health very bad. I wish she would consult some skilful Physician. Indeed I wish most heartily she would go to Philadelphia. The entire change of scene would benefit her spirits greatly, which are greatly affected by her bodily maladies. Mama's health is improving. She has been much better lately. Maria and her children are well, likewise Mary and Mr. Smith. I could write more but as I have Tom's work to do must conclude. With much love to Mother, and a hope that she is better—also to Margaret, of whose troublesome eruption I hope she is relieved, to Caroline and Fannie. How much I wish to see Williette and hear her sing. My love and sympathy to aunt Baxter, for whom I feel deeply. Your brother is as well as usual. I am ever your affectionate sister, E. L. C. Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Univ. of Virg.a Feb. 13. 1854 My dear Sister Mary, I received yr. letter today, and was really annoyed to think how long I had delayed writing to you. I cannot stop now to explain the causes of my delay. Lately, I have been suffering with a cold, and every day seems to bring with it full occupation. I should think it a profitable investment of funds to buy stock at par in yr. new bank, provided its management be committed to honest and capable men. Of the men selected I know nothing. Rightly managed it ought to derive 10 per cent. My only doubt arises from the liability of the stocks on wh. its circulation is based to become depreciated, owing to the unprincipled prodigality with which the legislature is increasing the state debt. I have taken some shares in a similar Bank (the Monticello) established in Charlottesville, but feel some uneasiness about the result. The shares, for which I paid $100, w.d now command $110. I would sell at once if I had any opportunity of better, i. e. safer investment. Your Bank, having no competition, ought to do a better business, than our bank here. Ours is doing well. If the shares can be had at par, i. e. for $100 each, I w.d buy. And as the money is lying ready, I would take the amount in this stock. If I see Wm. Stevens I will speak with him about the matter. It seems to me impossible that he can have collected the money from Chrisman merely to lend it to himself, unless the security were doubtful. Viginsay sends me word that the stones are nearly ready. I shall send the money as soon as they are put up. The inscription should, I think, be made to face towards the grave. Please send him word, as he wished to know. Give my love to Mother &amp; all the family. Yr. brother, affectionately, Gessner Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg Feb. 14th 1854 My dear son Francis Yours of 10th inst. is just reo.d &amp; I wish to say one or two things in reply, and in the first place I expect to hear something about the action of the court in the confirmation of the salo, but did not by yours. I saw by the papers that the court did not remain over 2 days in session, not doing any contested business but I presumed that they dispatched all plain business, as they remained part of 2 days. I hope so at least. I wanted to correct a blunder of Mr. Woods in his pork report. He wrote you in Dec.r that he had sold 2418 lbs porj in Charlottesville @ 5 3/4 to be paid at a future day. You say he reported to you 80 odd dolls for pork. I wish you would get Edward to see if Mr. W. has made a mistake. There is in one or the other. 2418 at 5 2/6 amts to $139.03 ¼ Let it be seen to soon. He is no scholar. Your Bank statement is 998.72 Bal I say 988.72 &amp; if Mr. Wood deposits the Pork money 139.03 Would leve to my credit 1127.75 Subject to the cattle bill of $42.00 &amp; Edwards &amp; your demands. The incendiaries are still at work. On Sunday night we had our Or. Mtg broken up by 2 fires. Summy has detailed the acct in a letter to Mary. There is an immense excitement here, vigilent commands, patrols &amp; all of the usual precautionary measures have been taken. It seems to me that these must be crazy persons, or children at the work for no sane man w.d risk his safety by working at so early an hour &amp; a moon light night. We have fine weather here now, as warm as spring, &amp; it makes us think of moving. Tell Edw.d to write about the court, clover seed etc. I have not yet heard from Mr. H. W. Fry of Richm.d from whom I oredered 4 tons Mexican guano. I wonder if it was sent. Love to all. Yrs truly &amp; affectionately D. G. Smith P. S. Your quotation of clover seed is high in C. In Beato it is selling at 6.50 which is a decline &amp; it is lower. I suppose Mr. Flanagan will get it in Richm.d at 7 to 7½ so that it may cost us about 8$ adding a com. to him.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philadelphia Feb 18—'54 My dear Eliza, I am now several letters in your debt owing in part to my having twice written to Dr. Harrison. I have not yet heard whether the small pox has spread since it appeared in Charlottesville, but as a late letter from Maria does not mention it, I presume that the alarm it first created has passed away. We never hoar from Maria or Mary, and your mother has always wished to know who the letter was from, which Mr. Smith said he had for her with a parcel, and which she hoped to get on his return from New York, when to our great disappointment he passed through this place so unceremoniously without letting us see him. Her old malady seems to be quite subdued, but a cold which she got by imprudent exposure confined her for a week to her room, &amp; for the first time she has ventured downstairs today. Her cough is still troublesome at night. I wrote Mr. Rives more than a fortnight since, informing him that I had not been able to get any timothy seed within his limits, and ten days afterwards he had not received my letter. I cannot account for it—and lest my last letter should also miscarry you had better mention it again—as I fear the delay will be a source of vexation &amp; disappointment to him. The rest of my letter is for the Doctor. A letter from Chicago today informs me that $2,000 was offered for one of our lots in Carpenter addition in 4 payments with interest—but as Ogden Jones &amp; I thought it would bring more 6 months hence I declined the offer. Indeed I doubt whether when property is manifestly so increasing in value, it would be advisable now to sell one of those—but one or two in Tucker's addition I should have no objection to sell. The President of the Rock Island R.R. informs me that the stock carries 10 per cent interest, convertible into scrip, until the road is received from the contractors, which he expects will be on the 10th of July next—but the scrip itself carries no int- erest—as I had been wrongly informed. A. C. Flagg, the Treasurer of the company will give the necessary information about the steps to be taken to convert the scrip into stock, &amp; to get more scrip if required. He lives in New York. But nothing need be done until July. The road was expected to be completed to the Mississippi by the 25th of this month. In the report to the syockholders the Directors do not seem to promise more than 10 per cent dividends the first year. I yet hope they will exceed that, but though they do not they will certainly increase afterwards. I send you a newspaper by which you will see more of the brilliant prospects of that wonderful town. Mrs. T. sends you &amp; the children including Mary Maria Messrs. Broaddus &amp; Smith her love in which I join &amp; I am affectionately yours George Tucker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Feb 20th 1854 Dear Sis E. We have been looking for a letter from you for a week and better. Mr. H. is still confined to his bed where he has been since the 11th of Jan. The Abscess was lanced 4 weeks yesterday and has been discharging ever since more or less. Pa says it is immensely large and will take a long time to heal. We have given up all idea that he will be able to attend the session of Conference which begins the 1st of March. I do not think (judging from the past) he will be able to sit up by that time, but we hope for the best, and are trying to submit to the will of our heavenly Father, who knows what is best for us and will not afflict us more than we are able to bear. E. R. and I have had bad colds, but are better of them. Pa is much better. The rest of the family are well. Was Aunt McCabe buried in the place where our dear little Cassie was laid, by the side of Rossy, or where? This is a very wintry day. The snow is falling thick and fast. Our love to all. Write soon. yr aff Sis E. P. Hamilton P. S. Mr. H. desires Bro. Smith to send him a copy of Mr. Orr's deed of trust. (Mrs. M. G. Hamilton to Mrs. D. G. Smith)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Mar 1st 1854 Dear Sis E. Mr. Rodgers was to see Mr. H. this morning early, and we were disappointed in not receiving a letter from you by him as it has been some time since you wrote. It would be very gratifying to Mr. H. to hear from Mr. Smith at least once a week during his tedious confinement. He is still unable to set up and at times suffers a good deal of pain. The Abscess continues to discharge freely. Pa says it is very extensive and will take a long time to heal up. It is a very great privation to him not to be able to attend the Conference which commences this morning, and mingle with the Preachers as he has been accustomed to do, and which to him was always a sorce of great pleasure. I suppose as Spring comes on you are anxiously looking forward to the time when you will leave Leesburg for the South. When do you expect to move. I am glad to hear that Leesburg has done her part so nobly, and come out in finances. You deserve a great deal of credit. E. R. is well and sends a great deal of love. We have all had bad colds, but are getting better. Pa is again confined to his bed but we hope only for a day or two. Write soon. Our love to all. yr aff Sister E. P. Hamilton (Mrs. M. G.

      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Mar 1st 1854 Mr. D. G. Smith Dr Bro Having written to you and E. this morning, I merely write to inform you that your letter dated 24th ult. is just received, having been missent as the envelope testifies and this accounts for your silence as we supposed. The draft is safely received. Your explanation with regard to the deed of trust is fully satisfactory to Mr. H. He does not wish a copy. We do not think there is any ground for uneasiness on Mr. H's account. The reason why he cannot sit up is on account of the location of the disease. He cannot bear the pressure upon the part which would ensue if he were to sit up. Should there be any change that would be dangerous we would inform you immediately. I will write often and let you hear from him. He is much obliged to you for attending to his matters. Please excuse all errors as I am in a great hurry. Our love to all. Most truely E. P.

      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg Mar 6th 1854 My dear son Francis Your note enclosed in a letter to Summy informs me of the clover seed purchase etc. I would be glad you w.d suggest to Mr. Wood the necessity of making some early garden, &amp; if he has not already got early potatoes for planting, ask Messrs Flanagan &amp; Co. to get us a Bbl of real Nova Scotia &amp; Maine Meroer potatoes from Richm.d to be certain that they are Northern fruit. There is a singular circumstance connected with the history of my affairs in Albemarle &amp; no less vexatious than singular, and that is with all my solicitation I have not to this time heard what the court did in relation to the sale of Morven. That was a palin business &amp; required the attention of no one from the frightened population &amp; of course I expected a decree of confirmation. If you can without much trouble get the information &amp; send it to me. Ask Mr. Rives by word or note."Did the court confirm the sale of Morven? Was there a commisioner appointed to receive the payments?" etc. The weather is becoming spring like, the deep snow has nearly disappeared, coming as it did (2 weeks ago today) prevented me sending the wagon as early as I expected. I shall if nothing prevents start it on Wednesday, 8th inst &amp; it may get there by 15th or 16th (8 days). I want Edw.d to pay some attention to it. I will inform Mr. Wood &amp; get him to meet it in town so that the driver Mr. Wm Sanders may return at once by R. R.d. I employ him by the day &amp; pay expenses. Mr. Wood can have our ox teams or wagon bro.t in from Morven &amp; divide the load to take out over the bad roads from C'ville to Morven, &amp; if the road is so very bad he could leave a part of the load in storage in town. Mr. Sanders may carry along a small package for you or Edw.d &amp; one for Mr. A. Douglas which will be left with you. I will direct him to call on you or Edward. Although I have written this upon various business matters I do not wish you to give any attention if by so doing you should interfere with your school business: but turn these matters over to Edward. We are well, except slight colds, &amp; all things work pretty well. Many expressions of regret are made by our neighbors at our intended move. Many are sincere. I have never written a word to my good friend Mr. Geo. Rives. Excuse me to him. Yrs truly &amp; affectionately D. G. Smith P. S. I regret to hear of Edwards folly mentioned in yr P. S.

I wish to consult you upon a small matter. We have been heretofore talking about getting furniture in Alex.ia but thought that perhaps we might get a portion of heavy things in C'ville. Will you take the trouble to make the enquiry. We should want a sett of dining tables, called Extension, say 4½ feet wide, &amp; 11 to 12 feet long when extended. Ours here is 4 ft 2 in wide. We want a strong well made mahogany table, also some other tables for rooms, breakfast, parlor etc., also bureaus secretary, Book case, Lounge, Bedsteads etc etc. Get a list describing the qualities &amp; prices &amp; send to me, wardrobes, wash stands tubs etc etc. You will excuse me for putting you to this trouble, but it may be done by getting a list as above &amp; looking at the articles to judge of the quality etc. In haste.

      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore Mar 17th 1854 Dear Sis E. &amp; bro D. I have delayed writing until this morning, so as to give you all the information I can about Mr. H. After waiting some time in hopes that the abscess would get well, Pa sent for Dr. Smith (the most eminent Surgeon in the City &amp; Professor of Surgery and Anatomy in the Maryland University) and had the abscess laid open yesterday afternoon. The operation was severe but soon over, after which they applied a bread, milk &amp; laudanum poultice to the part. They then gave him a large anodyne which composed him and enabled him to pass the night comfortably. This morning Mr. H. has very little uneasiness and Pa says it will heal up very rapidly. Dr. Smith told me after the operation that Mr. H. would soon be well, as the sore had nothing to do now but to heal up. Our trust is in our heavenly Father and with his blessing upon the means used for which we most ardently pray we feel encouraged to hope that he will soon recover. We have tried to be submissive to this severe affliction and have felt that we were sustained and comforted by the influences of the holy Spirit. Pray for us, that this dispensation may be sanctified to our good! Almost the whole family have been sick this winter. Ma has had a very bad cold, the girls one after another have had little spells and Pa is laid up every now and then. I have not time to write more. I will write again soon. Our love to all— in great haste yr aff Sis E. P. Hamilton (Mrs. M. G. Hamilton to Mrs. D. G. Smith)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Univ.y of Virginia Mar. 21. '54 My dear friend, I received your letter by today's mail, and w.d be very much inclined, if I had but the opportunity, to write about many things. Among the changes wh. warn one of the advance of years, none is more sensibly felt than the gradual passing away by one cause &amp; another of those who shared our every day thoughts and feelings—whom we could freely commune with. It w.d have been most agreeable to me to have restored the broken links of the chain of my life, in some sort, by having you here among my colleagues. I regret that the faint hope I had that this might come to pas, is destined to be disappointed. I am disposed to think that your reasons are satisfactory for declining to change your residence &amp; pursuits. There are some advantages here; but they do not include the provision for one's family, and only in a certain sense the education of one's children. It takes nearly, if not quite, every copper I receive to pay my expenses. I have labored very hard, have borne many griefs, and am growing old in drudgery, and have yet scarcely done any thing towards laying up a supply for a rainy day. The education of my boys is exceedingly difficult to accomplish-chiefly because I cannot command a moment scarcely to attend to them, being always day by day, &amp; night by night, prossed to the utmost of my strength by the demands of public business. I have found the Chairmanship forced upon me year after year—and this with my large classes makes me the veriest slave of the public, while my children are neglected. If I had not the conviction that my situation was ordered by providence, I w.d hardly be able to endure it. I hope at the end of this session to lay down, the dignity and thankless cares of this chairman's office, although the same difficulties stand in the way of my so doing. The Board of Visitors have been singularly content with my administration of affairs of discipline, and dont care, I believe, to make a change. And what makes the matter worse, we have no one probably ( to speak to you in confidence) that is at the same time willing to undertake the duties of Chairman and capable of successfully discharging them. I have, however, the written pledge of the Board that I shall be relieved at the end of this year. Pardon this talk about myself, into wh. I have fallen insensibly. Maria, you know, married the Rev Mr. Broadus, who has charge of the Baptist Church in Charlottesville. She is a member of the Methodist Church. But the difference of Church relations does not seem to impair the happiness of the union. They have two children. Mary was married last summer to Mr. Smith, who succeeded Mr. Rogers in the chair of N. Philosophy. He is acquitting himself so well as to meet fully the expectations of his friends. George Tucker, our oldest son, expects, with good reason, I hope, to take his master's degree this session. He has very fair ability and attainments for his age. What profession he will assume is yet to be decided. He thinks of the law. But I have no means to set him up. Edward Tiffin, our second son, is far more backward in his education, and I doubt if he is going to make a scholar. I doubt if he is fairly qualified to enter the University-and I dont see clearly what destination I am to give him. Should I have more time to devote to him, I may be able to solve the question-but now I dont see the solution. Peachey and Charley, the two next, are frequenting such schools as I can here obtain. They have both good natural endowments, and know some little—but nothing compared to what they ought to know. The few hours they have of daily instruction during the session allowing them, unlooked after by me as they must be, to spend their time too much in idleness. Henry William, the next boy, has learned almost nothing-although 9 years old—having had no teaching, except the little wh. his sister Mary has forced upon him. Bleanor Rosalie, our third daughter, is rather delicate, and only now begins to be taught a little at home by her sister &amp; mother. She seems disposed to learn—but where to get a school for her I know not. I cannot send her from home, and w.d not, if I could. Our youngest, Robert Lewis, is a fine boy, and is 5 years old. I would like to have the opportunity to have him properly educated. This depends chiefly, as I see it now, upon being freed from a part of my present duties, as does the education of my other older boys. I have given you a rather unpromising picture of my upper group of boys, but I try to look forward to doing something better for them. I have set forth some of the difficulties they have had to contend with. I have, I believe, done as well for them as, in my painful circumstances, I could. I am afraid it is rather unfair to return you so gloomy a sketch for the extremely pleasant and cheerful one you have been kind enough to give me of yrs young circle. I except from the above remark my two oldest children. They are most happily circumstanced, being married to men of work and promise, and being so near to us that we see them almost every day. They themselves have such education and lustre as fit them for their station, and both are members of the Meth. Church. Mr. Smith is himself a member of the Meth. Church. My letter has become a long one, and yet I am loth to stop here. If, however, you can read what I have written, it is well. My wife sends her love to your wife, yourself, &amp; family, in wh. I heartily unite. Yr. friend truly, Gessner Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Leesburg Mar 24, 1854 My dear son Francis I rec.d yours of 20th Linst., and am pleased at its contents. I did not mean to give you any cause for excuses, having only in some degree playfully stated that I was surprised that a little information so easily obtained, &amp; which I had several times asked for, could not be obtained &amp; communicated. I have hesitated to encumber you with much of my business, however desirable it is to me, that I could hace your services, because of your multiplied duties in your new station. Of course I should rather suffer inconvenience in my matters, than interfere perhaps detrimentally with your duties, &amp; for this reason I have on several occasions referred business to Edward, which perhaps your riper experience could have better managed. Of course my interests which are large in Alba.e should have the attention of some one of the family, and not left wholly to strangers, altho Mr. Wood may be trustworthy, he cant feel as full an interest as ourselves. You must not however permit anything to interupt your own peculiar business. It is all important that you acquaint yourself with high credit in your new station, &amp; I feel a greater degree of solicitude for your success than for any advantage I might derive from yr attention to Morven, for in the one case much inconvenience &amp; loss might result, while in the other (latter) it could be but of temporary disquiet if neglected. I hope now you will no longer feel uneasy. We shall not perhaps get out before May. I have not succeeded in selling either of my farms &amp; shall therefore be under the necessity of borrowing some money for the payment of the bal of my purchase of sevts. etc. We have nearly settled up but cant collect all. Will perhaps leave uncollected some 6,000$. Uncle Sandy owes 3700$. I hope he will be able to sell his farm. The Loudoun Branch R. R.d passes on one corner of it &amp; will enhance its value. When you see Mr. Wood urge him up with his corn planting &amp; oats sowing. You did not say how the wheat was looking on Morven. The money in Bank is at your disposal. You may have use for some of it &amp; perhaps Edw.d will want 60 or 80$ more. I shall make no calculations for its apprepriation in my matters here, but leave it subject to charges &amp; demands for schooling, if wanted. Yr. Ma joins me in love to our dear Mary, &amp; yourself—assured by Yrs affectionately D. G. Smith P. S. We expect to pass thro Alex.a where we shall perhaps purchase much of our new furniture. I think however the prices in C'ville are not high if the articles are good, about their quality you say nothing. The carriage &amp; expenses would be considerable if bo.t in Alex.a which might possibly be saved if bo.t in C'ville. Will Edward succeed? How does he conduct himself? I dislike his not visiting you oftener. Tell him so.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore April 4th 1854 Dear Sis E. &amp; bro. D. Mr. Hamilton is still improving, his sore is healing up very rapidly. We expect he will soon be able to leave his bed and if nothing happens he will get out by the 1st of May. We received yours of the 1st yesterday and were very sorry to hear of the loss you sustained in the accident that occured to the colt. It is a wonder that Dave did not break his neck too, as we expect he will some of these days by his recklessness. The weather is becoming more mild and I think you will find it more pleasant to move in May than it would have been this month. Eliza Ridgely has the measles. She is on one side of the room and her Pa on the other and I am nurse for both, so you perceive that my hands are pretty full just now. She appears to have them light, but as it is necessary to exclude the light from her eyes as much as possible we keep the room quite dark, so if my letter is written more crooked than usual you must remember that I could scarcely see to write at all. The rest of our sick are convalescent. Ma is nearly well, but is still very weak. Pa is better also and expects to go out as soon as the weather will permit him. Mrs. Nicholson was to see me yesterday. She seems to be in usual health. She has been quite unwell since she left L. but has recovered. She received a letter from Bro. Rodgers a few days ago. They are delighted with their appointment, have a fine residence with good furniture and every thing to make it pleasant. She expects to join them in their new home the last of this month. She sends her love to you and all her friends. Our love to all our friends and all your family. Write soon and often. yr aff Sister E. P. Hamilton (Mrs. M. G. Hamilton to Mrs. D. G. Smith)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charlottesville April 7 1854 Dear Bro:- Your letter informing me of the unsettled matter between Rogers &amp; myself came to hand during my absence in Philad.a or it would have been answered sooner. I transfered the Shafer note to Nevel, precisely for the am't I received it from you, so if there was a mistake you will have to correct it with him. We made off a list of the Notes transfered to him which he has doubtless now in his possession. We have no news, except the street fight on last Monday an account of which you will find in the Jeffersonian. We are "as well as could be expected under all the circumstances". In haste yours J. R.

      <field name="fulltext">Indianapolis Ia Apl. 14th 54 Dear Wife:- Here is I at the capital of the Hoosier State. I came up this morning from Cincinnati. It being but 109 miles we got here early in the day, and stoped to look at the town. Tomorrow I expect to go to Chicago, and spend the next day (Sunday) there. The distance is about 220 miles, and I expect to get there before night. Travelling is a mere circumstance in these regions. Railroads run over the country in all directions. Seven roads come to this city, and two others are in course of construction. Sixty four trains of cars come in every day. In fact the whistle of the Locomotive may be heard almost continually. This is a considerable town—its situation is beautiful and it is rapidly improving. Seven hundred houses are to be built this summer. Rather ahead of Rocktown. Every body is in a hurry, and to look at the movements of the people it might be supposed that they had not more than one year to live. It has been raining to-day, but now looks like clearing up, and I hope will be fair tomorrow. I will be home some of those days. I suppose I am not badly needed at home. Kiss Willie. I dreamed about her last night. Hoping this will find all well, I remain as ever yrs Wm. G. Stevens</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Charlottesville VaApr 23 Mrs. E. L. C. HarrisonUniversity of Virginia Midway April 22nd 1854 My dear Sister: Had I been differently circumstanced I would have written in answer to your kind letters long before this. For the last week I have been greatly troubled with neuralgia in my left side, &amp; the same indescribable suffering in my back and bowels as when with you: and to add to my uncomfortableness there is but little else around me but noise an confusion. The workmen are here at last, and the family and every thing else almost have to be crowded into this the new part of the house so that I have but a poor chance of getting much quiet or rest. This morning however my nerves are somewhat composed &amp; I take advantage of this unusual circumstance to write. I was truly concerned to hear that you had had so much affliction in your family, and especially that you had suffered so much yourself. Tom's illness must have frustrated your domestic arrangements very much. Indeed I dont see how you managed to get along without him. By this time I hope he is able to discharge his duties and you are relieved of much trouble and anxiety. Bodily and family afflictions are the orderings of a wise and gracious God, and designed for our good, tho' for the time grievous to be borne. Evidences are they of our Father's loving and caring for us—they are the promptings of his love, and looking to him as their author the deepest pang of body and soul is sweet. As you said, Sister, 'tis all important that we should make religion the chief business of life. Almost every day some friend or acquaintance falls around us, reminding us that we too are mortal and know not how soon we may likewise fall. Uncle Ryland Rodes, Pa's oldest brother died week before last of Pneumonia. On Saturday morning his physicians thought him in a fair way to get well; but before the middle of the day the disease seize the brain and he died on Sunday evening. Pa was sent for on Saturday night &amp; got to his house about noon Sunday; but his Brother never knew him—he had fallen into a stupor and never opened his eyes except when suffering great pain, and then there was no expression-all consciousness was gone. His family is most deeply distressed and all that we can hope is that they may become resigned, and be profited by their deep affliction. We have been very much concerned about Brother for some while; but he is better now and we think is getting well. About a month ago he took a deep cold and we feared it was about to fix itself upon his lungs-he had a cough-look very badly &amp; had night sweats. I hope the worst is over with him. I did not undertake music and French as I designed. I found that I could not stand it, at least I would have little or no satisfaction in doing it, for the least effort of mind affects my nerves so much that I would have been in a continued state of excitement. And to practice too I w.d have had to have occupied pretty nearly the very spot in which my loved one breathed his last, and this was too great a trial. I have not heard from over the mountain for two weeks. I fully expected a letter from Carrie by the last mail, and being so anxious to hear from Mother I was greatly disappointed in not getting one. Minnie and Lucy send many thanks to Aunt Eliza for the nice dresses you sent them. Lucy is talking very plainly now, says almost any thing she wishes. Ma, Miss Sherman and the girls unite with me in love to you &amp; family. My love to Mary and Maria. I hope to hear from you soon. Affectionately your Sister Mary</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. April 24th 1854 Dear Sis E. &amp; bro D. We received yours of 20th inst and it found us very much as when we last wrote. Mr. H. is about the same. He is still unable to sit up, his wound heals so slowly as scarcely to show any change. E. R. is well, and has again started to school. Ma is much better but not able to attend to any thing yet. The rest of the family are well, except myself. I have a bad cold which I think might claim some relationship to the Grippe you have in Leesburg. We are sorry the weather has been so much against you this Spring, but surely it cannot last much longer. Your plan of taking Baltimore in your route is the best, for we want to see you before you go south. We would prefer Dave to stay until you come, a few days will not make any difference, and it will be much safer for him to come with you than to come alone, for while it would increase the expense, we would not think it safe for him to come alone, as there are always busibodies peeping and peering about. Let us know definitely when to expect you. Our love to all. Write soon. yr aff Sister E. P. Hamilton (Mrs. M. G. Hamilton to Mrs. D. G. Smith)</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Alexandria May 2.d 1854 My dear son Francis Enclosed I send you a Bank draft on Bank of Va. for $6000, which I wish you to put in Bank to your credit so as to draw &amp; apply it as follows. I have written to E. G. Higgenbotham, requesting him to send those sale notes of mine to some authorized agent of his, (Mr. Wood, atty or any other) &amp; to let you know where to find them, &amp; pay them off. There is the leal on the larger note of 2000$ with some interest I suppose, also the joint note of R. H. Carter &amp; myself $1450 &amp; perhaps Int. This I will pay in full &amp; arrange with Mr. C. Also the 2315$ note for cattle grain etc. This leaves bears no interest, but the 2 former I am inclined to think, nay I am sure, do &amp; this must be p.d to a person duly authorized by Mrs. Higgenbotham, as executrix etc. The 2 former to E.G.H. Com.r etc perhaps it would be as well to enquire of Mr. Alex Rives who are the proper payees, &amp; when you do so you had better pay Mr. R. any fee he may have charged to me for several matters upon which he has been consulted etc. The whole amt of those notes will be some 5800$. If E. G. H. does not send promptly as I requested him by this mail, &amp; let you know, please drop him a line &amp; urge him to do so. The notes will fall due about 17th May, but I wish to pay now. We are here, so far on our way, expecting to spend a few days in Balto, a day or two in Geotown &amp; as many more in Alex.a. May get out about 12th of May. Praying the blessing of our Heavenly Father upon my children, I assure you of my continued love. Affectionately yrs D. G. Smith P. S. I requested Mr. Wood to see R. H. Carter about the woman Mary &amp; he will report to you whether she is well enough as pr contract before paying that joint note. I had forgotten to mention this matter in the body of this letter. I had written the within in Leesburg expecting to despatch it from here by mail on my arrival, but as Summy will go out tomorrow morning to carry out 3 trunks, carpet bag, Hand trunks, Dog etc &amp; I will sew the letter in his vest pocket so that it may be as safe as pr mail. There is a severe change in the weather &amp; on the way here on Tuesday I exposed myself &amp; took a violent cold &amp; am now suffering with a pain in the left breast &amp; irritation in the throat &amp; chest etc. I am almost persuaded to go on to C'ville &amp; after a while when we get littler weather come on to purchase, but I hope to get better in a day or so.

      <field name="fulltext">Univ.y of Virginia May 7. 1854 My dear Caroline, I received Mary Jane's letter today, and as I have not this long time either written to you or heard by letter from you, I shall send my answer to you instead of to her. True I have very little to write; but I am not contented without occasionally writing, if it but a few lines, and I am always glad to hear from you if you would write but enough to let us know how you are doing, &amp; what immediately concerns yourself and the family. We have been reduced to few in number, and since dear Rush's death, you have lost almost wholly a natural protector. I feel deeply for you all; but am so much immersed in the cares of my public duties, added to the charge of my own large family, that I can do very little in the way of rendering you any assistance, by counsel even. Yet I am always anxious for your well being, and w.d be glad to hear more frequently from you. Especially would I be glad to hear of your spiritual welfare—that you are making this your great concern, how you may enjoy God here, &amp; prepare to meet him in peace hereafter. He alone is wise who "seeks first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness", for he has the assurance that "all things else shall be added unto him." This Kingdom must be sought by simple faith in Christ as our prophet (Teacher), priest (atoning sacrifice), and King ( law giver &amp; ruler), and with all the heart. We cannot serve two masters. We cannot love God &amp; love the world at the same time. We were glad to hear that dear Mother, although still sufforing so much, was a little better than when Mary wrote last. May God abundantly comfort her in her afflictions, and cause the light of his countenance to shine upon her. We have had a number of conversions among us lately, including above 20 students, &amp; some 5 in the families, namely 3 Miss Courtenays &amp; the 2 Miss Howards. We rejoice in this good work, and pray that it may become more and more powerful. How ready is God to bless, and how unbelieving are we! An Episcopal minister preached for us tonight a good sermon. He is named Coffin (Dr. I think)-and who do you think I found him to bo? The Methodist preacher Coffin who was once on Rockingham Circuit. With love to all. Yr. bro. aff. G. Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Alexandria May 8th 54 My dear children I rec.d from you Francis your letter in regard to fish, &amp; have attended to yr order, &amp; since our return from Balto I have been informed by yr note that the draft was rec.d &amp; Higgenbotham w.d be attended to. We expect to get to C Ville about on Wednesday or Thursday. The weather has been so cold we cant half attend to our matters. I am now sitting by the fire with my overc.t on my shoulders, writing this. We heard Dr. Roberts of Balto preach today, a good sermon, &amp; we communed with the Alex.e friends. They seen to be a more loveing &amp; devoted people than those we left behind. I think we shall have to get a good part of our supplies, (furniture etc) at C Ville. It is high here &amp; the fr.t very high. We shall have to stop with you a faw days. Can you accomodate us? I notice what you say about my deposite in Bk. &amp; am not at all surprissed, when you loaned me the 1000$ I thought you too sanguine, but the offer being prompted by the kindness of yr heart &amp; desire to relieve &amp; aid yr father, that I could not refuse &amp; unhesitatingly gratified you, persuaded at the time that it could not be permanent, &amp; therefore made the deposit in anticipation of yr demands. It is a cheap exporience for you. Next year I have no doubt you will be able to invest 1500$ permanently. Yr. expences hereafter should not &amp; need not exceed 1500$ &amp; this is a large allowance. Last y.r you had all to fix &amp; buy, besides experience in management. It was necessary &amp; unavoidable. I hope you &amp; Edward will find the fund sufficient for yr demands. This moveing enterprize I find is not so pleasant as it might be. I have had a miserable cold which sticks to me like a leech, since our return from Balt. I got Summy's letter by which I find he got out safe, but the goods are still at Gordonsville. I hope they may be got on at once. The carriage by exposure may be damaged, or depredated upon if there is no responsible agent there. Perhaps between the 2 companies it may be neglected &amp; Summy had better go down &amp; have it sent up &amp; pay the freight. I shall send in a few days a roll of carpetting; a roll of oil cloth in long Box, a Blk Smith Bellows, Anville, vise, Brass kettle, a shower Bath, a refrigerator, some 5 to 7 Bbls fish, I keg roes, 2' Bbls sugar, 1 Bbl or Box China ware, 1 do Coffee, etc etc. Also so e Bo es furniture Bales Beds etc etc all of which must be got on soon. I hope Summy will be manly &amp; attentive to business till I Got on. He ought to ride to Morven, &amp; open the last boxes we sent so as to air the beds &amp; clothes, if damp. I hope our dear Mary &amp; babe are well. We want to find her so &amp; in good spirits &amp; Edward I must not forget. We rejoice at his happy change. Accept our best love for one &amp; all. We have concluded to let Howard preceed us a few days &amp; he will hand you this. Your affectionate father D. G.

      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore June 5th 1854 Dear Sis E. We have waited a month hoping to hear from you or Mr. Smith, and Mr. H. wishes me to send you a line to inquire the cause of your silence. Soos after you left us a letter was received for Mr. Smith. Mr. H. enclosed a note in it and forwarded it to Charlottesville to the care of Francis. Did you receive it? A few days after you left us, we moved into the room you occupied during your short sojourn with us, which we find much more pleasant for the summer. Mr. H. is about the same as when you left him. On last Saturday week they operated on him again almost as severely as the first one, since which time he is thought to be in a better condition. This morning Pa said it was healing very fast, and they now think it will improve more rapidly. Pa is still very feeble. The rest of the family are well. Are you all settled in your now home? How do you like it? We hope you are pleased. Let us hear from you as often as possible. Do not forget to inform us of your address when you write. Ma &amp; the family send their love.

      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia June 11. 1854 My dear Mother, It has been some considerable time since we heard from you, and we are of course anxious to know how you are doing. I was disappointed at not getting a letter today. I know how difficult it is sometimes for the girls to write, especially as they have so much to claim their attention; and do not think of finding fault with them. I have been so much occupied with my business that I have hardly had the opportunity to write to you, although I would be glad to write often. I am glad that I am able to say that the health of our family, through the mercy of a kind providence is pretty good. I have been somewhat ailing for some days, but am nearly well again. I need all the strength of good health to enable me to get through the labors of the remainder of the Session. Our servant Tom is slowly mending: but whether he will ever be well I am yet unable to say. I trust, my dear Mother, you are abundantly sustained by Heavenly grace in all your afflictions, and that you find comfort in casting all your care on Jesus &amp; his atonement. As I have often said to you, our afflictions may be made blessings, indeed, if we patiently and humbly commit our cause into the hands of our merciful &amp; sympathizing friend, the Savior of Sinners. We should give ourselves and all we hope or wish into his care, asking Him, in perfect confidence that he willingly takes charge of us, to guide us continually in the way of life. To doubt his love and mercy, after all that he has done for us, is very wrong. To trust him, to ask him for his blessing, believing that he answers our prayer, is well pleasing in His sight. Let us conctantly cherish the recollection of his goodness as well as of our unworthiness, and pray for the Holy Spirit to strengthen our faith to claim all his blessed promises. Maria &amp; the children were some days with us while Mr. Broadus was in Richmond. They are all well. Mary's infant is growing finely, and improves daily. Yr. son affectionately, Gessner Harrison All would send their love if they knew I was writing. G. H. Mary Rush and the children are now with you, we understand, and I trust they are well. Give my love to Mary &amp; to the rest of the family.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia July 7. 1854 My dear Mary Jane, Eliza wrote to you that we expected to reach Harrisonburg tuesday next. I have been striving to arrange my affairs to visit you as soon as possible, and my hope was to be ready to leave at the time we had appointed: but I am now afraid I may be delayed some days. I have some business remaining which I can hardly leave to other hands, and begin to doubt if I can accomplish it so soon as monday. I dont want you to be disappointed, and write accordingly. I have been compelled to neglect my private business so much that, although I have exerted myself, and almost wholly disregarded the intense heat to get it arranged so far as may be now necessary, I have some things left that ought to be attended to, and which I may not be able to settle before tuesday. Besides I dont know exactly the arrangement of the valley stages—whether we can go on immediately from Staunton or must be detained a day. Some day next week, if Providence permit, we shall expect to see you. Meantime give our love to Mother and all the family. Yr. brother affectionately, Gessner Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Peachey HarrisonHarrisonburgJudy Ann Sherwood July 9th '54 My dear Mrs. Harrison, I was very sorry not to be able to keep my promise to Mary Jane last year, of sending you some salsify seed. I am glad now that I can send you some for the coming year. I have been much pleased to hear that your health has been rather better than usual this Spring. I trust that though you may never again be totally exempt from all bodily infirmity, that yet your health may be such as to give a charm to life, and that you may long be spared to your family and friends. May we hope to see you again on this side of the mountain? When I should claim a longer visit than your last one to me. Eliza will tell you that our dear father's health seems at last giving way, but as he has improved since he has been with us I trust he may get over his recent attack. Mr. Rives I am sorry to say is very unwell. The warm weather we have lately had has had a most debilitating effect upon him. He joins me in best regards to you and the girls as do also Papa &amp; Mama. Most truly and sincerely yours, Maria R. Rives</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Maria C. BroadusCulpeper Court House Morven, July 11th 1854 My dear Maria, I have been wishing to write to you ever since you left, but never thought of it at a time when I could do so. From the date of my letter you will see that I am not at home, and therefore have not been able to attend to your request as to blackberries, but I think I may promise certainly to do them yet, and it will afford me great pleasure to accommodate you. There are quantities of blackberries all around here, to be had for the gathering, and if I can only get some the day I go home it would save some little expense and trouble. Summerfield and I walked out yesterday and gathered 2 quarts in less than half an hour, and not half on the bushes are ripe yet,it seems to me they will last a week or two longer. I thought I could write you a long letter, but I find it so difficult to compose my mind this morning, that I do not know whether I can og on with this attempt at a letter. Mr. Smith left here Sunday morning to go to church, and here it is tuesday and I can neither see nor hear anything of him, nor imagine any business which could have detained him. You know I am not much given to apprehending evil, but in this instance I confess to feeling great uneasiness, and it is only by great effort that I can sit down to do anything. We are invited to spend the day at Mr. Douglasses and it is a delightful morning for going. I hope Mr. Smith will arrive before the time comes for us to go. Friday we rode to Mr. Stevenson's and went from there to Mr. Rives' where we remained until late in the evening. Saturday we dined at Mrs. Macon's and had quite a pleasant time. Miss Virgilia upon further accuaintance is an uncommonly pleasing girl, and there is a Miss Heath staying there, who is a very pretty girl. So you see we have been quite gay in the country, but I am getting more and more sober in my tastes, and enjoy nothing so much as quiet with regular employment. Yesterday I commenced a tragedy of Goethe's, from reading which I anticipate much pleasure. The young ladies all left me on Monday week, leaving us as quiet as possible. I received a letter the other day from Mrs. Fleming urging us to visit them this summer and if Mr. Smith agrees to it, I think we must go. As Howard is in a hurry to be off to town I must close.my letter. With much love to yourself, Mr. Broadus &amp; the children. Your affectionate Sister Mary Stuart Smith (RSH)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Aug 1st 1854 Dear Ellen, There is little or no change in Mr. H. His symptoms are rather more favourable, but he is very weak and the heat of the season makes him suffer more than he would do. The swelling has abated some little. The wound continues about the same, but we are still encouraged to hope that when the weather becomes cooler he may get better. We are glad to hear you are all well. We received Mr. S's letter of the 28th yesterday. I should write more frequently if there was any information with regard to Mr. H. to communicate, and if any important change takes place either way I will let you know immediately. I am constantly with him day and night, and never go out except once in two or three weeks to get a little fresh air. The weather has been and still is intensely hot. The health of our City is very good, and I hope it may continue. We are all well for which we are very thankful. Our love to all. Write soon. yr aff Sister E. P. Hamilton (Mrs. M. G. Hamiltom to Mrs. D. G. Smith)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Richmond, August 7, 1854 Dear Sally, William has enclosed you to day ticket to Lucy Olivers wedding. I told him he might go up Thursday or Friday next &amp; take you up if you wish &amp; can go. You must not go unless all the children &amp; Nannie &amp; the Baby are entirely well. I do not see how you can leave Alice. She will not consent I am sure. Can you leave her? If you take her Ellen must go with you to take care of her &amp; you must not let her eat anything to hurt her. Probably she will stay with Sister Nannie &amp; the Baby which will be much best. Try to persuade her to do so. You ought to go over Tuesday morning. The wedding takes place at night &amp; come back Wednesday evening, as you cannot stay from Alice more than one night I am sure. William will bring your wrapper which Mr. Allen had not sent to the store, also the childrens dark aprons and a box of candles for Nannie &amp; probably some other things. Our grapes begin to turn &amp; look tempting. You must not let Nannie come back until 1st Sept or later. Write to me often &amp; address your letters plainly to care of Robertson &amp; Hudson, New York. Dear Sally I wish I could be with you—take good care of yourself &amp; all the dear ones with you. Kiss the children for me &amp; give my best love to all. Richard goes with us in the morning. Yours ever &amp; truly Wm. (Elizabeth Echols' grandfather. EDG)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harrisonburg Aug. 21st 1854 My dear father I feel that both Mr. Smith and I have been very negligent in not writing to some one of you since we left you, but I hope you will excuse us as we both think we can offer good apologies. Mr. Smith stayed at Rawley Springs only 3 or 4 days, and returning here left friday morning for the White Sulphur. I think he was somewhat improved by the Rawley water, but he found the place too dull and uninteresting to stay long. I have not heard from him since he reached the Springs so I cannot tell when he thinks of returning home, but I know he is very anxious to be there by the 1st of September. I am to meet him in Staunton. The baby is growing fast, and is as well and happy as possible. I promised Mr. Smith friday certainly to write to you that on the next day, but I have been quite sick ever since, and feel weak to-day, although I hope I am nearly well. This is court day here and the town is therefore quite noisy although usually a quiet place. My eyes pain me a good deal to-day which must make my excuse for writing merely a short note; I simply desired to let you know that we were all doing well, and would probably be at home soon, when we hope to see you all. I hope you are all well likewise. With much love to yourself, Mother, and the boys. I am your affectionate daughter Mary Stuart Smith (To Dr. Gessner Harrison)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Aug.23rd 1854 Dear Sis E. There is no apparent change in Mr. H. All his symptoms continue about the same as when I last wrote and there is very little hope of improvement in the Abscess until his general health is better. This desirable result they are endeavouring to accomplish by the constant use of Tonics taken internally, and also by exciting and stimulating appliances to the wound, but his system is so dormant that every effort to excite it has had little or no effect as yet. Pa called in Dr. Dunbar (a gentleman of much skill and experience in his profession) to his aid, and after an examination of the case, he approved of all the means which were being employed and concurred with Pa, that the abscess could not heal without a great improvement in the general health of Mr. H. They also think it would not do to heal it up quickly, as it might turn inwardly upon some vital part. But amid these discouraging outward prospects, his spirit continues cheerful and he is kept peaceful, and resigned to whatever may be the will of our heavenly Father concerning him. He is very patient, and I find it an easy task to nurse him. E. R. is a great help to me, and delights to wait on her Papa. She has a cold at this time, but her health has been very good all the Summer. My own health has been much better than for several years past. I feel very grateful that it is so, as I am thus enabled to attend M. G. H. constantly. Our trust is still in our Father in heaven who while he has so long and deeply afflicted us still sustains and comforts us with his grace. Continue to pray for us. We hope you are all well and happy. Write soon and often. Our love to all. yr aff Sister E. P. Hamilton (Mrs. M. G. Hamilton to Mrs. D. G. Smith)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Fincastle Sept 7th 1854 Dear Cousin Caroline After so long a time, I now attempt to write to you in answer to your letter to grandma. I think I owe you an explanation for not having written sooner, which I fully intended doing, But for several reasons I have not done so. I have been away from home lately, and have been very busy when at home for we all have to start to school soon. Boxter is going to Washington College, and we have all been very busy so as to have everything in readiness by next week. Grandma was highly gratified and pleased to hear from you-she is always delighted to hear from Harrisonburg. She was very anxious about Aunt Martha having heard some time ago of her being sick. We have not heard from there since, but I hope she is now well. I am happy to inform you of grandma's good health—she says she thinks she can attempt to go to Harrisonburg this fall very safely, as she thinks she can't rest satisfied without seeing you all soon again. There has been a great deal of sickness in our town this summer, but it has been remarkably healthy compared with some other places. I think it one of the most healthy situations I know. We of course dont expect to be free from those epidemicks which prevail all around us, but besides which we have very little sickness. My little sister, Rosa Emeline, had a very severe attack of Flux, b ut has now recovered entirely, except that we have had little or no sickness in the family. Pa received the Charlestown paper yesterday which informed us of Cousin John Huntor's marriage. We were not at all surprised to hear of it, as Aunt Martha had written telling us that it was to be. Grandma sends her love to your Ma and sisters—to Aunt Martha and little Maggie and to Cousin Fannie Stuart and thinks she might write to her. She told me to thank you kindly for your letter for it was so very satisfactory—she wishes you would write often. Tell Aunt Martha that she says she expects to be at home in October. Please excuse the freedom with which I have written my first letter to you, if it should appear so, for I can never write any other way than what I think. Although I've never seen you I have heard you spoken of so often that I dont think of you as a stranger. Ma sends her best love to you all. Please overlook all mistakes and write soon. Your affectionate cousin M. R. Paine</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore Sept 20th 1854 Dear Sis &amp; bro Smith Yours of the 15th inst has been received. We were glad to hear you were all well. You complain of not hearing from us more frequently. I wrote you twice since your letter before the last was received, and if there was any improvement in Mr. H's condition I would gladly inform you of it, but as far as we can judge he continues the same. I do not think his strength is declining and he suffers no pain from the Abscess, and were it not for the difficulty of breathing occasioned by the swelling of his stomach pressing against the lungs he would be comparatively comfortable. From this cause he experiences much uneasiness at times. The Abscess does not appear to be healing although it does not discharge so much as formerly. He has been confined to his bed nearly nine months and the Summer has been unusually severe, and yet he has been sustained and brought through it by our heavenly Father. Even in the midst of affliction we realize that "The Lord is good" and with the assurance of his word, that "all his ways are faithfulness and truth" and that no good thing will be withhold from them that walk uprightly" we endeavor still to trust in Him. We are in hopes that the cool weather may brace him up so that he may be able to go about the house again if no more. He still maintains his cheerfulness and his spirits are as elastic as ever. Bro. Rodgers was to see us last week. He was very well and much pleased with his new home. He, as well as we, regrets that we could not all meet at your house this summer to enjoy your company and partake of your hospitalities, as we had anticipated, but if we are faithful to the grace given already we need not be disappointed in meeting all our friends on that blest shore where parting is no more. There, "No slightest touch of pain, No sorrow's least alloy, Can violate our rest, or stain Our purity of joy." May this be our happy portion forever. Let us here from you often. Our love to all. yr aff Sister Eliza P. Hamilton (Mrs. M. G. Hamilton to Mrs. D. G. Smith)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore Oct 10th 1854 Mr. Daniel Smith Sir, I send you these hurried lines to inform you of the change for the worse in our Brother Matthew. From 3 O'clock today he has lain in strong convulsions. He has not been conscious of any thing since. Although we were expecting his death, at some time from the affliction, yet it came in such a manner we least expected. Eliza bears it as well as we could expect. We will let you know by Telegraph when there is a change for the worse or better. In haste With respect H. V. Davis N. B. Sister wishes me to say if you can come on she will very glad to see you. H.

      <field name="fulltext">University Va. Oc. 11th 1854 My dear Mary Jane, I have been wishing and intending to write to you for come time past, but as usual at this season of the year so many family cares crowd upon me I find it quite difficult to perform my duty as a correspondent. After some deliberation your brothet consented to let George attend the Polytechnic school in Philadelphia, to prepare himself for a civil engineer, the vocation he has chosen to follow. He left us on Thursday last, and arrived safely in Philadelphia 12 o'clock the same night. I hope it may be of service to him in many ways. He requires more knowledge of the world before he enters upon it. He was suffering from a boil on his neck, which I hope only occasion temporary inconvenience. Mary is now unable to do any thing, from some affection of her eyes, owing to nursing her baby Dr. Cabell thinks. She is quite depressed from this cause. It is a sore privation to one so active and busy as she is disposed to be. Her sweet little infant is as fat and good as she can be. The University has opened very auspiciously. There are upwards of 415 who have been leave to matriculate. Your brother has 175 or more in his class. Mr. Smith nearly a hundred; so far, every thing promises to go on smoothly. I trsut it may continue so. I do not know that you ever heard of the agreeable visit. we had from Mr. Tutwiler &amp; his daughter Maggie, who is a fine intelligent pleasant girl. They were here from Saturday until the following Tuesday morning early in September. It seemed to me he looked better than when last here. He asked very particularly after his Harrisonburg friends, and seems to feel an unabated interest in all his old friends. Edward has become a student &amp; I hope will be stimulated to greater exertion. Peachey, Charley and Willie go to Mr. Fu—- a student. I teach Rosalie every day. Mrs. Wm. C. Rives has a fair in Charlottesville Friday and Saturday. We do not feel particularly interested in it, as it is to complete a very costly church in her neighborhood, which ought to have been finished long ago. The whole Union has been laid under contribution. She wrote a note to all of her acquaintances here asking aid. Much against our will, we were constrained to do a little out of courtesy to her. The Presbyterians and Baptists also intend having fairs. I feel much more interested in theirs. Maria and her little family are well. She was at Mary's Monday spending the day. Mr. Broadus' congregation have raised his salary to $1300. His church is not yet completed. We had a visit from Judge Clement Clay of Alabama and his charming wife, who is one of the most interesting persons I ever saw. They called in Charlottesville &amp; remained some days on their way from the springs. She lives in Huntsville and told me a great deal of Eliza Beirne and Maria Irwin whose name we heard for the first time. She married remarkably well, but was in a singular condition, having had every appearance of being in the family way for ten months, without any result. I feel very uneasy about her. Poor Eliza I fear will ultimately die from cancer. I fear the disease is in her system, and that the operation performed will only bring temporary relief. She has been at the springs all summer. We deeply regret Mother's infirm state of health should have prevented her coming over to pay us a visit. I trust we shall hear she has been suffering less of late. With best love to her, Margaret, Caroline, Fannie &amp; a kiss for Williette, I am ever your affectionate sister, E. L. C. Harrison P. S. I have heard nothing of Mary lately</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore Oct. 17th 1854 Dear Sis E. I am very much disappointed in not hearing from you and Mr. Smith. Can it be that you have not received a hasty note written by Hannah Virginia on the 10th informing you of the violent turn in Mr. Hs disease—or a line or two from me on Thursday telling you he was some little better? Today he is no worse, though weak as an infant, and Pa says with care he may so far rally as to be as well as he was before this last attack. The spasms on Tuesday afternoon and night were most severe. Two or three times during the night they all thought he was dead except Pa—he said no. Dr. Houck said he was, that there was no pulse at the wrist and the heart had ceased to beat—but Pa insisted he would revive-and through the mercy and goodness of our heavenly Father he did revive—but did not return to consciousness until Thursday morning about day—when he recognized me and called me. O how my poor heart loaped within me at the sound of his loved voice—for I feared I should never hear it again. He has spoken of you both frequently—and sends his kindest love to you and also to the boys. I would like to write more but cannotspare the time—as he requires constant attention. Pa has been untiring in his attentions exertions to relieve him— and has sat at his bedside for five or six hours at a time. It has been a great comfort to me to have him here, as I know nothing has been, or will be left undone that could be of service to him. Pray for us—that the Lord would continue to bless the means employed and restore him again—or if this cannot be that he would prepare us for all his will and sustain and support us in this our time of need. O for grace to bear the blow whenever it does come. He is perfectly resigned to his Father's will and as patient as possible—no murmur or complaint escapes his lips.

      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Gessner HarrisonUniversity of VirginiaMr. Rives Sherwood Oct. 25th 1854 My dear Eliza It is quite a trial to me that all this fine weather should pass by without my being able to go up to make my fall purchases. But there are so many things on hand that cannot be put off such as digging potatoes, hauling sand to point the new house etc etc. that I have to postpone my trip yet for another weekm besides these things it is quite probable that Gen B. &amp; sister Lucy may be here towards the last of the week and I should not like to be away. Mr. Rives will have to go in Sunday evening so as to be in time for the Richmond cars in the morning (Monday) and I shall probably go in at the same time, though I do not much like for us both to be away at the same time. I shall consequently make but a short trip but hope you will be able to come out with me. It seems to me I never saw as much to do any fall before. Mr. R. has James and John out all the time, and I have not yet been able to put down a single carpet. I saw Mrs. Stevenson last week and she gave me some amusing anecdotes of the springs. She seems to think that Dr. Schele addressed Miss Pickens-besides being very attentive to her over the mountains he came out several times to see her while she was at Enniscothy. Col. P. made some enquiries about Dr. S. as if they were taking the matter into consideration. He is evidently bent upon being married, &amp; if possible to some one of consequence. How is George getting on in Philadelphia? I hope his boil has not been as tedious as mine which after being very large is gradually disappearing without having much of a head. Mr. Edward Coles has returned without purchasing of Stricker, they could not agree about the price. Mrs. Thacker told ne she wished you would send out some rags for her to finish your carpet. She says she has some balls chiefly red. She does not think those will be more than 6 or ten yds. &amp; it would not take a great many. Jane has finished your work which I will take up. Mr. Gadcomb plays agreeably on the Piano. I hope after awhile he will give Rosalie lessons. He says he was in bad health for a long time &amp; took lessons two years. Mrs. Stark is now making a good deal of butter. She is putting up about 40 lbs for me and says Mrs. Ward from the U.y sent her word she would take 100 lbs. at 20 cts.-perhaps she might also put up some for you or Mary at the same price if you wish it. Mr. R. has to go in tomorrow but will not have time to see you. Your affec sister Maria</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nov 14th Tuesday 54 My dear Maria, I have been promising myself, for some time, to write to you; but the natural indolence of my nature has so well argued with my feeble resolution, that procrastination was the result. Hoping then you will pardon my silence, and attribute it to the real cause, in future, I promise to be a faithful correspondent &amp; hope you will follow such good example. I have written home two letters lately &amp; have received no answer as yet. Ma does not favour me with very long letters, &amp; therefore there shd be a greater abundance of them. I may be curious in my tastes but I like to have long letters &amp; badly written, it is a pleasure to me to con them over a second time &amp; thus prolong the delight. So never apologize to me for a badly written letter. We have quite a large party here now. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Boden, Mrs. Donnell &amp; Miss Robbins. The 3 first will not be here more than a week more. Fr. the short acquaintance I have formed with Miss Robbins I like her very much, tho' not pretty she is very lively &amp; good humoured &amp; seems to be amiable and obliging. She plays on no instrument &amp; thus is deficient in one of the most attractive of accomplishments. I would give a good deal to hear you play some of your pieces. I have heard no good music on the piano since I have been here. I hope you find time to practise some little every day. I went to see Mr. &amp; Mrs. Outerbridge some time ago, &amp; the former said he admired your playing very much. Mrs. Outbridge asked concerning you &amp; Mary. I was sorry that you had not sent some messages to them. They are very kind people. I am very sorry that I could not send Mary her gloves, the person I gave them to was taken sick &amp; could not clean them by the promised time. I missed two opportunities pending them, one by Mrs. Bledsoe &amp; the second by a box I sent home containing a coat I could not wear. By the by, will you please tell Pa I sent off my coat in a small box yesterday. It was directed to him &amp; went by Adams Express. Tell Mary I will send them by the 1st opportunity. I have received several letters fr. Edward Smith, &amp; from the tone of the last I gathered that he had been unsuccessful or rather disappointed in his love affairs. I too dislike to pry into his or anybody's secrets, &amp; therefore I will not ask him about it. You may perhaps have heard some rumour concerning the officer (for I know that the Univ.y is not wanting in tattless) if so, I feel a curiosity to have my conjectures either confirmed or dissipated. I was very much obliged to you for the cake you sent me. I enjoyed it very much. I wrote to Mary some time past, &amp; have not received an answer; her silence I conjecture from what Ed. Smith said was owing to her eyes. I hope they may soon get well. Is her little girl as fat as ever? I was very sorry to hear that poor Mr. McKennie had been attacked with such violent disorder. I am anxious to hear more about him. I have not found as yet many acquaintances in the city, tho' I know some few young ladies. I was introduced to a Miss Shubrick this morning whom I found quite pretty etc. 1 2 doors below us there are 2 young ladies ( the Misses Cleeman) whom I visit, &amp; like very much. Mrs. Cleeman is a Virginian by birth. I saw Mr. Rogers in the street some days since but did not speak to him as he was busy talking to a number of gentlemen. I have not called on Dr. &amp; Mrs. Rogers tho' I design doing so shortly—they live on Girard Street not far from this house. I shall call this evening at Dr. Dunglison's. I have been there only once since my arrival. When you write you must give me a long &amp; detailed account of everything which engages your attention, from the most trivial occurrence to the gravest matters. Kiss Lida &amp; Annie for me. Give my love to Mary &amp; Mr. Smith, Pa &amp; Ma &amp; all my brothers &amp; Rosalie when you go to the University, &amp; to all inquiring friends say that I do not forget them. Tell Mr. Broadus that I would be thankful if when he is disengaged he would sometimes write to me. I must now conclude, by wishing you the joy &amp; happiness. My love to Mr. Broadus &amp; so for yourself &amp; children receive my love. Your affectionate brother Geo. T. Harrison Grandma &amp; Grandpa would send their love if knew I was writing.

      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Nov. 16th 1854 My Dear Sister E. I embrace a moment of leisure to inform you that Mr. H. is a little better than when I last wrote. The improvement is slight and very slow and we cannot tell whether it is permanent or only temporary, but we are thankful for even a mitigation of his sufferings. I cannot describe the extreme suffering he has endured from difficulty of breathing and pain in various parts of the body. Every one, even the Physicians, consider his restoration thus far as almost a miracle. Our trust is still in Him who does all things well, and if he sees best for us, he can and will raise him up again. His mind is kept in peace being firmly stayed on the Lord. His constant desire and prayer is for entire resignation to the will of our heavenly Father. Pray for us, that the means employed may be rendered still more efficient, that he may be restored to health once more. E. R. is well and sends her love. She is very attentive to her Papa and makes herself useful. The rest of us are in usual health. Our love to all. Write soon and often. yr aff Sister E. P. Hamilton (Mrs. M. G. Hamilton to Mrs. D. G.

      <field name="fulltext">Midway Nov. 19th 54 My dear Sister Mary: Your very kind letter reached me on yesterday about noon &amp; I was making preparations to write to you in answer Tom Yancey &amp; his friend Mr. Jones came in, &amp; I had to take Fannie's place in assisting Ma in some work she was about, in order that she might entertain them. Addie is still away &amp; all such responsibilities here are resting on Fannie. I regret it exceedingly for tho' I am still suffering a good deal I intended writing you a good long letter. I am glad to hear that Mother is having better health &amp; hope that she will be content to stay constantly in doors &amp; not run the risk of taking cold &amp; increase her sufferings by going out I promised myself the pleasure of seeing her &amp; all of you this trip of Pa's, but owing to my recent attack of nervousness &amp; neuralgia &amp; the cold changeable weather I must be disappointed. I— suffered intensely for some days &amp; nights. My nervousness was so great that the least sound or jar caused by walking across the room almost crazed me. I yet fear that 'twill yet send me to the lunatic asylum. I feel a great deal better now, pretty nearly free of pain. but still ache a good deal in my left side, from head to foot as usual, &amp; my nervos are by no means composed. I hope tho' by being prudent &amp; quiet to be in my usual health soon. I had heard of Mrs. Effinger's death but never heard any of its particulars. Was she a member of any church? How mysterious are the dispensations of Providence! Mrs Spears death had not reached us. Tho' she had such a death like look last summer I cant realize that she too has gone to the spirit land. Oh how important to live for Eternity! to let all that we think say &amp; do have a direct intent to please God our Father, &amp; thereby secure his continual favour. Then tho' death may come at any time, even as a thief in the night we will have no fear-nay we would welcome him as the faithful messenger of our Father to take us to his bosom of love-to join with the redeemed &amp; loved ones where sorrow &amp; parting shall never, never come. Oh for grace to die daily to the world &amp; live afresh to Christ. God requires the whole heart or none at all, &amp; yet how the most of us live-one moment for God &amp; hours perhaps days for ourselves &amp; the world. Oh! Father forgive us &amp; help us for the future to break loose from the world with all its sins &amp; pleasures, &amp; give our hearts unreservedly to thee. I have much to tell you about but Pa is ready to start &amp; I must stop. I will write to Mother this week if I am able. Give my love to her &amp; all. If Carrie &amp; Fannie think the straw bonnet will do for Minnie &amp; will not cost as much as a new one, get them to have it fixed for her if you please. I would be glad too if you would get for me enough cruel white &amp; crimson to make rigolettes &amp; comforts for Lute &amp; Minnie. I will only want crimson enough to make the balls-the rest white, &amp; 1 yd. of buff calico like the dresses Sister Mag. gave the children. Minnie got hers stained &amp; I will have to take some out of the skirt. If Miss Bettie has any pretty material for hoods &amp; dont cost too much I w.d be obliged to you to get them-the down too. The children send all kisses, My love to every body. Very hurriedly but affectionately your Sister Mary Lucy says she is sorry for Willie &amp; she must come to see her &amp; Minnie.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Dr. Gessner Harrison (Professor of Ancient Languages)University of Virginia Columbus, Miss: Nov. 21st 1854 Dear Sir— I am sure I need make no apology for troubling you with this letter, as the object of my writing is to subserve the cause of education. The Trustees of a School about to be started in the southwestern part of this county have solicited me, as their old acquaintance and friend, to give them my aid in procuring suitable Teachers; and in the first place a Principal; and I have consented to do what I can for them. They prefer one who has been raised and educated in the South, and especially one who is a graduate of the University of Virginia. In discharging the task, which I have agreed to undertake for them, it has occurred to me that I could not do better than to address you for information upon the subject. Of the many who have gone through a course of study in your school of Ancient Languages, there no doubt may be some who have been preparing themselves for the profession of Teachers, and who would, of course, be glad to get a lucrative situation in that capacity in a healthy, pleasant section of the country, where the society is good, liberal minded and intelligent. Precisely such a situation is offered in the high school, proposed to be started at Crawfordsville in this county. I send you the advertisement of the Trustees, to which I would beg your attention. I have visited that neighborhood often, am well acquainted there, and know that it is all it is represented to be in the advertisement. The people are planters all, most of them independent in fortune, generous hearted and intelligent—the fortunati agricolaeof Virgil. They want a school of the first order at their doors, and they will pay liberally for it. What the exact salary will be, I do not feel authorized to say, but I presume about one thousand dollars per annum, which, considering the cheapness of living in that section of country, I should think would be a tempting offer to a man just setting out in life, and whose only fortune, or hope of a fortune consist in his good moral characterm his intellect and his energy. If, out of the many who have attended your classes and have completed their studies at the University, you know of any one whom you could recommend as competent and faithful, and who would be willing to accept such a situation as that offered in the enclosed advertisement, I shall be happy to be made the medium through you of giving the information to the Trustees; and I hope I shall not be considered intrusive, if I request an early answer from you. Mississippi has heretofore, I believe, been well represented at the University of Virginia, and in order that she may be better represented in future, it is all important that we should have good Teachers to take charge of our schools. No where, we feel persuaded, can we more safely look for such Teachers than to Virginia and to the Alumni of your Institution. I cannot close this letter, without congratulating you on the highly flourishing present condition and still brighter prospects of the University, in which you, for a quarter of a century have been one of the chief and honored Professors. My latest information is that the number of students already reaches four hundred and fifty for the present session, and that it is increasing. When I left the University in 1827, there were not two hundred—a change indeed! With my best wishes for your health and happiness and for the continued prosperity of the University, I remain, dear Sir, Most respectfully yours, H. H. Worthington (This is the advertisement—worth copying I think! E.D.G.) Teachers Wanted The undersigned, as Trustees, have been instructed by the members of the Dabney Lipscomb Lodge of Masons no. 144, to make public application for a teacher or teachers to take charge of a first class school, which will go into operation on the 1st of January next, at Crawfordsville in the south western part of Lowndes county, Mississippi. They have purchased a house and lot, and everything will be ready for the opening of the school by the day mentioned. The location is one of the best in all the southern country. Though in a prairie region, the lot is sandy land, the only spot of the kind in all that part of the country, and the water is excellent—pure, cool and limpid. The Mobile and Ohio Rail Road, now fast approaching its completion, will run directly by the place; this with the branch rail road to Columbus will afford it unsurpassed facilities for traveling in every direction. The teacher or teachers to be selected will be expected to be thoroughly proficient in every branch of English Education, as well as in the Classics, Mathematics, etc, and must bring undoubted references of good moral character. None others need apply. And while we would not be exclusive, we yet deem it pertinent to say that a member of the Masonic Fraternity would be preferred. The salary will be liberal and punctually paid. Apply to Scott Thompson Esq., Chairman of the Board of Trustees at Crawfordsville, Lowndes county, Mississippi. Scott Thompson A. W. Richardson Jesse Smith October 21, 1854</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Midway December 6th 1854 My dear Sister Mary Your kind letter came safely &amp; I trust was duly appreciated, tho I did not answer it as soon as I should have done if everything had been well with me. Again I have been suffering greatly with neuralgia. My nervousness has not been so great as in the first attack, but I have suffered intensely. I felt rather badlt from Friday till Monday morning of lastweek, which time Ma &amp; Pa had fixed on to go to Town to have their pictures taken by Mr. Keagy, leaving me in charge of her domestic concerns, &amp; rather than they should be disappointed I encouraged them to be off-that I should be able I thought to act the part devolving upon me. But soon after they started I felt worse and was suffering exceedingly in a little while, &amp; was not relieved for several days. I have used a great deal of Laudanum, &amp; am under its influence a good deal now. 'Twas resorted to as the last remedy- for I cant bear the idea of habituating myself to the use of it. From it I have received temporary relief &amp; tho my thoughts &amp; ideas are scattering and without any control- I will not let this opportunity slip of sending you a letter before one could reach you by our cross mail. I was truly concerned to hear of Mother's illness but hope she may be better if not entirely relieved by this time. What a comfort it must be to her to have aunt Baxter with her! I trust that their being together will prove comforting &amp; beneficial to both. Does she (aunt Baxter) stay with you much? Of the general good health of our Town I was glad to hear, &amp; happy to learn that God has again visited our branch of his church in the conviction &amp; conversion of sinners. May they prove faithful is my prayer. I am much obliged to you too for the kindness extended in making th those purchases for the children. Will you please to tell me where the down is put, &amp; how the skirt is put on, whether the ends hang down loosely, or are confined to the head piece &amp; how all must be cut straight or bias, &amp; how to be quilted-in rows or squares I am glad you could not find the worsted for rigolettes. They can do without them. About the ribbon on Minnie's bonnet, do as you all think best. If what was on is not too much soiled put it on, but if it is please get new &amp; send the bill with the bonnet. Pa has just returned from the burial of one of his sisters Mrs. Smith, mother to the youth who called with Dr. Williams to see me. She was a good woman- all that gave her any concern was le leaving her little children. I hope she has made a happy exchange of worlds &amp; that friends will be raised up for her motherless little ones. Only nine months elapsed between her &amp; uncle Rylands death. May it prove a lasting warning to all surviving them. Be ye also ready. Addie &amp; two of our cousins came up from Buckingham together. Joe Jones (the brother) has been confined to his room the greater portion of the time since they came. Has had something like jaundice. He is better now in a fair way to recover. The rest of the family is pretty well with the e ception of myself. Lucy &amp; Minnie are both well and in fine spirits. They are both sleeping now or they would have some message to send you. Minnie sometimes says she is going over the mountains when Addie goes. I am thinking when the time comes she will think she cant leave me. I expect to go to the University soon after Christmas. We will have a still house soon. The little Yanceys, Miss Sherman, two of our friends &amp; Fannie will leave Saturday morning if arrangements are carried into effect. My love to Mrs. Stevens &amp; Lucy. Sallie speaks of coming out here to spend Christmas holidays. I hope she may. The family unite with me in sending love to you, Mother Sister Mag &amp; all. Kiss Willie for me. Good bye. Affectionately your sister Mary F. Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University Dec 12th 1854 My dear Mary Jane, I thank you very kindly for youe last truly acceptable letter, which should have been answered before but for some painful circumstances. Poor Tom, after lingering so long, expired on Thursday last at half past seven in the morning. I could wish he had given more decided evidences of a change of heart and preparation for another life. He told Cassandra Monday before he died that he felt he was not prepared, that he must be lost if he died as he then was, and said he would try to pray, that he had often thought during his illness he would give himself to the Lord, but his pains were so severe he could not pray, and when he obtained relief he was so exhausted he was equally incapable. Poor fellow he furnishes but another strong argument to those in health, not to put off the salvation of their souls to a dying bed. He exhibited the most remarkable apathy to the subject and it seemed impossible to arouse him to a sense of his condition. We can but hope as "God seeth not as man" the prayers offered in much feebleness and weakness may have been accepted. I was truly happy that we were able to afford him every thing that could contribute to his comfort. He became perfectly helpless only three days before his death. The University has been in an unusual state of excitement for several days past, in consequence of Mr. Nash's and Edwards suspension for three months. The circumstances are these. Mr. Helm the friend and room-mate of Mr. Nash, was insulted by a drunken student at the Presbyterian Fair in Charlottesville. The following morning Helm called on the young man (Henderson) for an apology which was refused. Cromlin from Alabama the friend of Mr. Henderson was determined to settle the matter by fighting. Mr. Helm proposed to refer the matter to his friend, he looked in Mr. Nash's face and said twice "damn your friends". Where-upon Mr. N. struck him. He drew a bowie knife, but upon Mr. Nash's pointing a pistol at him he desisted. Mr. Helm upon being challenged to a fight gave him a blow, Cromlin drew a bowie knife and cut at him several times. Being unarmed Helm called upon Edward who handed him a pistol which served to intimidate him. For being armed Mr. Nash and Edward were punished. The Faculty are extremely anxious to put a stop to the use of arms. If they could effect their object I would be heartily glad for Edward to remain a year instead of three months, but I greatly fear it will have a contrary effect. A petition has been sent in by the students to beg their being re-instated. I presume it will be hardly granted. I cannot see how they can do it consistently. Edward has received a great many kind offers of assistance in his studies, which Dr. Harrison thinks he could not accept with propriety, as they were from persons attached to the University, Mr. Joynes, Mr. Dinwiddie, &amp; Mr. Smith. I have been extremely anxious to hear from Mother again. I hope she is recovering from her attack &amp; that we shall hear some good news of her. Your brother has of course a good deal of trouble just at this time. He fears Edward will sustain a great loss in not being able to attend the lectures. He requires the stimulant of the lecture room. I called on Mrs. Harris yesterday. I only knew of her being here Sunday. I was quite surprised to find her at the stimulant of the lecture room. I called on Mrs. Harris yesterday. I only knew of her being here Sunday. I was quite surprised to find her at Church. She is looking very well. Mr. Broadus and Maria are well. They dined with us yesterday. The latter came out in her new cloak made by herself. I think it is the prettiost I have seen this winter. I hear very agreeable accounts of George. He is a great favorite with every body. I am glad he has resumed his music. He practises with Richard Dunglison &amp; a young man at Miss Plumstead's. Miss Robbins from the Eastern Shore a friend of Ma's is spending the winter with her. Mr. Smith is well again. Mary's eyes continue in the same state. I have heard of some other persons affected in the same way from the same cause. I think Mr. Bowcocks conduct any thing but what a Christian minister's should be. I think we might mention some standing hypocrites as well as kneeling ones. My best love to Mother, Margaret, Caroline &amp; Fannie. I wish I could see Williette Kiss her for me. Tell Fannie she must let us hear from her when she goes to Baltimore. Mary Harrison will hardly pay us a visit until Miss Sherman leaves. Your affectionate sister E. L. C. Harrison Our minister is a Mr. Whitehead. No body knows him here.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">To Dr. Gessner Harrison My Dear Sir I am much obliged to you for your promptness in replying to my late communication. I inadvertently omitted to ask you to forward to W. R. Capehart, Murry Hill P.O. Bertie Cty North Carolina a printed copy of the Laws of the University, which I now beg you to be so good as to do. Mr. C. is the young gentleman who speaks of joining the institution &amp; I am anxious that he should be well informed on every subject connected with its management. There is some prejudice existing in this State against Virginia &amp; hor favoured University, of which I presume you are not aware; so strong in some instances as to lead to a preference of Northern institutions. I hope this feeling is confined to the marginal counties; indeed I believe it is; though one would suppose a freer intercourse &amp; better acquaintance would long since have nullified the feeling. Your letter afforded me no ordinary degree of pleasure. I read again &amp; again your once familiar signature, with increased &amp; increasing emotions. It was like opening a new a lost chapter of my life, with all its familiar incidents &amp; exciting pasts. And you now have nine children! What a contrast with my two!!! Six boys &amp; three daughters? I but two daughters!!! One grown son &amp; two married daughters? I but two children!!! My eldest is only 15. The youngest 11 years of age &amp; yet our ages do not differ materially!! You have been but once married &amp; I twice! A daughter by each wife is all that I have left- ( a son by each having died many years since)-while you have been blessed with nine by one! I wish I had two sons, though I do not make that wish in complaint. After leaving the University I studied Law &amp; obtained license to practice-boarded in W.S. immediately afterwards, &amp; soon after my return married a niece of our collegiate friend Norborne W Lewis of Brunswick, Va-purchased an estate on the Roanoke in this State-settled upon it &amp; directed my energies to the cultivation of the soil. My wife soon died &amp; in 1840 I married Miss Kate Capehart of Bertie Cty. N.C. She is still alive &amp; in the enjoyment of good health &amp; comparativel youth. By the by she bids me say to you that time has dealt with me gently indeed for with the exception of a few gray hairs I look &amp; am younger &amp; handsomer than when she first formed my acquaintance. I have never engaged in public life though repeatedly solicited by the Democracy of this State, deeming it unsuited to my temper &amp; uncongenial to my tastes. Apart from that I never placed that estimate upon honours, (as my whole course at the University abundantly shews) which others did. My life has been a prudent one, free from all &amp; every species of dissapation; &amp; the result thus far fully gratifying. Though never engaging in public life I have nevertheless been a political student &amp; kept well up with the times in all its progressive moves, &amp; now regard myself a `young American' though like yourself approaching that period of life where caution begins to predominate &amp; the fire of youth begins to be mistaken for its folly. I know what your course in life has been, always knew "the result". I hope all your children may inherit the Father's virtues. Present me kindly to your Lady &amp; believe me Your friend Thos. Goode Tucker (Summit P.C. North Carolina Dec 17, 1854 P.S. What has become of Tutwiler?—-Wertenbaker?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Midway December 28th 54 My dear Sister: The tidings brought me by your last kind letter were truly painful, but were ordered in the one case, &amp; permitted in the other, by an all-wise Providence for good; &amp; I trust that we will be properly exercised thereby. How uncertain are the promises we make ourselves for the future! How little we know today of what tomorrow will bring! Oh! how necessary, how all important to feel continually our utter helplessness, &amp; lean upon the strong arm of God for succour &amp; support to bear &amp; we should, the troubles &amp; afflictions incident to our pilgrimage here. I rejoice with you in Edward's reinstatement; &amp; earnestly hope that he may never be placed in similar circumstances again, Tho' the motives which prompted him to act were highly honourable &amp; praiseworthy-to act thus under the most favourable circumstances brings upon one's friends feelings of pain and anxiety, &amp; for the future I hope, I pray he may be saved from all such scenes. With my love tell him I congratulate him upon the final result of his troubles &amp; hope that eventually all will prove to his good. Poor Tom-his fate was a sad one. I dont know why you had never told me so; but I was under the impression that he was still able to render service in the dining room, &amp; was not prepared to hoar of his death. But he has gone the way of all flesh, &amp; we would fain hope to a brighter better world than this. I feel greatly concerned about Mother. I have not heard from her for three weeks. Why 'tis so I cant account-they may have written &amp; the letters are lying in an office somewhere. If the morning mail brings me no letter from them I will certainly write by the daily mail. We are all alone. Miss Sherman left two weeks ago for her home, Uncle William's daughters a week after, &amp; on friday before Christmas Brother, Miss Jones, our relations, &amp; Maria left for Buckingham. (Fannie has been out there some weeks). Pa has been from home the greater portion of the time for the last week, &amp; there is so much quiet that this scarcely feels like home. I must say however that I have enjoyed it, tho' 'twould have been more pleasant &amp; profitable too if the family had been more together. 'Tis a time I think that calls for praise &amp; thanksgiving, &amp; ought to be a religious, rather than a mirthful jubilee. The children have both had dreadful colds, but are better of them now. Ma thinks Lucy has worms-she has been on the verge of delirium several times, all of a sudden, &amp; she thinks worms must have caused it. We have given her calomel, but I dont think it has any effect in that way yet. The rest of us are in usual health. I am still suffering in my old way-sometimes scarcely able to be up tho' I am looking to be in common health. Addie speaks of goingover the mountains soon to spend a week &amp; Minnie I think will go with her. She is anxious to see her Grandma, &amp; I have given my consent for her to go. If she does I cannot visit you before she comes back. I cant say exactly when; but I judge about the first of February. Addie &amp; Ma wish to be remembered kindly to you. My love to Brother, Mr. Broadus, Maria, Mr. Smith &amp; Mary, Rose &amp; all of the boys. Kiss Lida &amp; all of the little ones. Lucy is asleep, but Minnie is up &amp; sends Lida, Anna, Eliza, Rosa &amp; yourself love &amp; kisses. To Bobbie she wishes you to say that she is going down to see him soon &amp; thinks they will make a very nice little class in studying geography. I hope to hear from you soon. Affectionately your Sister, M. F. Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Va.Dec 30 Miss Mary Jane HarrisonHarrisonburg Virginia University Dec 29th 1854 My dear Mary Jane, I was extremely glad to get your letter a few days since, and now hasten to answer it. We were all rejoiced to hear that Mother was better, and hope she will be still farther improved when we next hear. I need not say how much pleasure it would afford us if you could pay the visit you spoke of. I still hope you may find it in your power to do so. I shall be very happy to see Fannie if she will make us a visit in the spring. I hope indeed her health may be greatly improved by a little change. Mr. Hardesty I presume had left when your letter came, at least it was some time after every one else had gone, who proposed going away. I can get Maria's pattorn and send it by the first opportunity, though it does not appear to be the most fashionable style. Those most worn are made full to a yoke. I dare say you have seen them, for every one here almost has one made in that style. Miss Calhoun a young lady staying at Dr. McGuffey's, who seems very dashing, has a black satin one made in that way. Sister Maria has Maria's pattern. I will send and get it, if you still wish it &amp; send it by the first opportunity. We had a very quiet Christmas. The morning was a delightful one, but the after part of the day was rather gloomy. Mary had a Christmastree Saturday night for the little children of the University. It was very pretty, lighted with tapers and a number of pretty things suspended on it. They seemed to enjoy it very much. It was a pretty sight to see all the little creatures around it. Sophy Bledsoe helped Mary a good deal. She is a very smart ingenious girl, and has a great turn for fancy work, as well as useful. Mary goes to Mr. Bledsoe's every day to hear them read, as she is unable to read herself. They kindly insisted on her coming over every day. Lucy Downing is also very kind in going over and reading an hour every morning. The day after I wrote to you, Mr. Nash and Edward were reinstated, much to our relief. I am sure it would have been a serious disadvantage to Edward. I hope he will be more prudent in future, and that no similar occasion may arise to need his interposition. Christmas is always to me rather gloomy time. We almost always make some change in our domestic arrangements, which is more or less unpleasant. Peyton, the man whom Dr. Harrison purchased of Mr. Farish, got drunk a few weeks ago, and we thought it safest to return him to his master now when we could do so without any difficulty. In many respects he was a good servant, but not such an one as I should care to own. He was almost too large &amp; too old to be trained well as a dining room servant. Henry, Flora's second son, is confined by an accident he met with some weeks ago. He was loading a cart with wood and the load fell upon him, by the upsetting of the cart. He is now getting better, and we propose taking him in the house. He is a smart boy, but of course it will be very troublesome. George was well when we heard from him. Mary's eyes continue pretty much in the same condition. She thinks they are rather better. Your brother has had a most troublesome boil under his knee. It almost prevents his being able to go about. It is in a bad place. Every time he moves he irritates it. He is not willing to lie by all the time, which is the only way to do. Give my best love to Mother, Margaret, Caroline, &amp; a kiss for Williette, also to aunt Baxter. Ever your affectionate sister, E. L. C. Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Gessner HarrisonUniversity of Virginia Sherwood Jan 12th 1855 I am sorry my dear Eliza I have not had an opportunity before of sending the cloak pattern. I hope you will not get it too late to be of use to Mary Jane this winter. I have finished mine, and wish you could see how smart it looks, reflecting great credit on my economy &amp; ingenuity. No one would have supposed that the old London cloak was capable of coming out again with such an imposing effect. It shows the advantage of good materials. I wish we were together, that I might have a hand on yours, though perhaps you are too fashionable to wear silk, when cloth is the rage. Tell Maria I was just a week about. I got a letter from Papa yesterday written Saturday. He said they were all, but Mama going that night to the Opera, to see Grisi in Norma. He said he had gotten 4 tickets at 3 dollars, but Mama's scruples prevented her going to the Theatre especially on Saturday night, &amp; he disposed of one. George was anticipating a great treat. They had called the day before to take leave of Mrs. Patterson, who in a few days, with Helen, a Miss Norris, Robert his wife &amp; sister, were to embark for Europe to remain a year or two. Papa was called to the parlour to see two gentlemen the morning he wrote, and to his surprise found the two Mr. Lauries; who are making a visit to the United States. He told him that Mrs. Conger is living with her brother William in a large house in New York, which they built, and that they give a large dinner once a week. Poor Tom Tucker is dead, and I am very much surprised to hear, that he would have spells of intoxication, thoug he still attended to business. Richard who was formerly so intemperate has reformed, and now has a good situation on some rail road, I feel sad when I think of the fate of this family. They were kind and affectionate to me, and I spent many happy hours with them. Catherine keeps house in New York &amp; Fanny lives still in Bermuda. Most of their misfortunes I daresay may be traced to the terrible infirmity of Mrs. Tucker. In childhood they were too much left to their own guidance, and many of them yielded to her besetting sin. Mr. Rives will either come up by the cars today or by the boat tomorrow, to Scottsville; Mr. Flannagan has withdrawn from the concern in Richmond, and the new firm will be "Stokes and Co." I see Mr. F. commends the new firm to the patronage of his friends, from which I hope the change has been made, without creating any bad feeling on his part. Mr. R. has had bad weather for his trip, did you ever see such a number of dark days together? It is a proof of the improvement in my eyes that I have been able to sew all the while. I send you a letter I got from F. Gwathmey to read though she says that she intends writing to you soon. I was not aware until she wrote that she had a little granddaughter in Baltimore, more than three months old. I suppose Rosalie told you that I found the "instruction book" at Flannagans. I waited until the cars came in that day, &amp; sent to see if Mr. G, had arrived. He had but declined going out as he wished to get Dr. Norris to operate on his teeth. I left &amp; he went to see the dentist, finding he would be engaged all daym he hired a buggy and attempted to overtake us. We got here just as the children had finished dinner and just as Rosalie &amp; I had eaten the Turkey hash they left, to our surprise the little man came up. looking as cold as a frog and saying he was very hungry only having taken a cup of coffee that day. When I asked him if he would give Rosalie lessons in Music he very readily said "yes he would", but has not yet proposed to begin. He is not as reserved as he was, but is a strange little body. Certainly inclined to take his ease. He is probably waiting for longer days to come. Abram brought the news from Nelson of the death of dear Mrs. Anthony, though I did not hear it until last week. I have written to poor Mary Ann. I feel deep sympathy for them all, and well know what a dreadful bereavement it is, though she has so long been in such feeble health. She died Thursday, in Xmas week. I wish you would send my little clock to Smith to regulate, and tell him, that it required winding up twice a day, after he had it before. Give my love to Dr. H. Maria, Mary etc and hoping I shall hear from you soon, I remain your affectionate sister Maria Rives. P. S. As I presume you never got the note I wrote you by Mr. Gadcomb-I will tell you here that the children were delighted with the books you &amp; Mary sent them at Xmas, and Tucker &amp; R. have been reading theirs with much interest. This is Rosalie's birthday and having a few I have treated her to a Charlotte.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University Jan 17th /55 My dear Mary Jane, Hearing that Mr. Bowcock was going to Harrisonburg this morning, I thought I would send the pattern by him, which I presume you will understand. The piece in front is sometimes worn loose, but Maria keeps hers fastened below, which is a great improvement. Here has the effect of a plain round cloak. The loose ones look as if they had been torn. The trimming is put on the edge of that side piece as well as down the front and around the yoke. Your brother has been suffering a good deal with a sore leg. I hope it is now in the way of getting better or well. The last sore has been more like a carbuncle. These things are always tedious, and will take their time. He is apprehensive that another is coming on his thigh. Maria has been suffering with pain in her head, similar to an attack she had in Harrisonburg some years ago. I believe it is sun pain. It comes on at regular periods every day. She is getting better, but I fear it may be some time before she is well. Mary is quite well, as also little Eliza, who is a sprightly little creature. Our sympathies have been much excited lately, by the death of Mrs. M. Carter, who was confined about five or six weeks ago, but never seemed well. She finally had an attack of pleurisy which occasioned her death. Her friends had much com to comfort them, she was not taken unawares, but seemed willing to go, and left a cheering evidence of her fitness for Heaven. It is sad indeed to see one so young, taken away from a young family, but God, who does all things well, has no doubt ordered all in wisdom. Mary wrote me word she would visit us in February. I shall be trulygled to see her. I must bring my letter to a hasty conclusion as I fear Mr. B. may go early. My best love to Mother, Margaret &amp; Caroline, a kiss for Williette. We are greatly pleased with our preacher, though no one but Mary had heard him preach. Ever your affectionate sister, E. Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore January 24 1855 My Dear Cousin Mary I have thought for some time that I would write you a line to let you know that you too are not forgotten by me. I intend to write to all, and not slight any of my Friends who I have left behind. Cousin Margaret's letter came to hand on Yesterday it gave me great pleasure indeed to hear again from home, and that Aunt Polly was better than when I last heard from her. I do hope it may continue and that she still will improve in health. I am always glad to hear from any of you all be sure and write often, to one who thinks of you all very frequently and wish sometimes that I could see you all to have a little chit-chat about matters &amp; things in general. And so William has sold his interest in the store at last. I know he is glad to get out of it. My Uncle Dick is beginning to use his money, or his wifes in a hurry, so much for marrying a rich Lady, he had better take the House too. I suppose he would if it was not for boarding Mrs Stevens &amp; Lucie. I have been thinking since I got Cousin Margarets letter that perhaps William would get in the notion of buying the House if Cousin Margaret was willing, but if I were in her place I would not get into that scrape for a good deal. I suppose in the Spring we will have new neighbours, how do you think you will like them, I guess if they are like they used to be, they will borrow us out of House and home. Lida did not seem to care to go to Housekeeping whe when I saw her last, thought she would prefer boarding as she knew but little about domestic affairs. Where will Mr Way go now that he has sold his House &amp; lots. I am always sorry to hear of any of our Southern Brethern selling, with the idea of going away. I always wish for more to come. I like to see my Church increasing in membership &amp; such as will hold out faithful to the end. I wish myself home every Sunday to go to my own Church dont call me selfish, for really I cant help having such feelings. I dont enjoy myself here like I do at home when I go to Church. I am so very anxious to see &amp; hear Bro Clark preach, from what I hear of him, he must please both in private and public. What is William's opinion of him, does he find any fault to him, like he did to our Bro Williams. I hope the climate will suite him better than it did our Bro Williams. I do hope that this will be a pleasant year to all, and that Bro Clark may win many souls to Christ, that he may feel that he was not sent to us in vain, it would make my Heart rejoice to hear of a revival of Religion in the Southern Church. Tell Caroline that I say she has cut me out of my Preacher Beau from the way he is writing to her, when he promised me that he would write me. I dont know what to think of such treatment from one of our Preachers. I hope she will not captivate our Bro Clark too, before I get back I beg of her to let some one else have a little chance at him, now that she has two strings to her bow already. His singing I know would charm me. I expect it is better that I am away, or may be I would be smitten with him as I hear he is such a nice Young Man. I am sorry that I have not gotten you a Cloak pattern yet. I did not know whether you would be willing to pay for one or no, so I have not bought one yet. The full Cloaks are all the rage here, some put the Yoke all around to the front, quite deep which I think are very pretty. I have not been to Mrs Brown since she promised to get a pattern for me. I have been very busy working for Mary. Have you made your Cloak yet. I wish I was there to help you if you have not. You must be sure and take the Green plaid. I bought it for you and the gayer one for Caroline, if she was here she would think it very plain, compared with the gay broad plaids which are worn here. I am sorry that William did not take Cousin Margaret one. I told him to get her one, but he thought she was rigged out for this Winter and would not care for one, but I knew better than he did, but if I were in her place I would not get one this Winter. I saw a very pretty piece of silk for 4/6 purple &amp; white not very broad or narrow plaid which would make a very pretty Dress for Summer maybe she would like that, or some other colour at the same price. I have been thinking very seriously of buying Furs to keep my Neck and Wrists warm instead of getting a silk Dress. if I had a little more money I could buy both and maybe I will. I intend pricing Furs this week to see how cheap I can get a set. I will attend to the Hankerchief's. if you want to be in the Fashion put deep Lace on your collars. They are worn very large indeed and plain Black Velvet Bonnets with Plumes on the sides are all the go. You see a few of other colours, but very few without Plumes and Satin Cloaks made full with velvet stripes put on. They are lovely. We are all as well as could be expected. Kiss Willie for me and tell her I want to see her very much. The family join with me in love to all. Give my respects to William &amp; Bob why dont they write to me. I dare say they have someone rare fun now that they are together. Try and make them good boys. who does William beau now that I am away. Give my love to all. Write soon, very soon and give me all the news. Did Addie &amp; Minnie. Bell sends kisses to Willie From your Cousin Fannie</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Feb 14th 1855 Dear Sis E Bro S Your mutual letter of the 10th was received last evening, and I was surprised to learn you had not received any letter from us for some time past. I wrote you a long epistle immediately on the receipt of yours four weeks ago and wondered why you did not write again. How does it happen that our letters so frequently misscarry. It was not the case between here and old Leesburg. The blame must lie somewhere, and we may as well place it to the charge of Post-Master Campbell and make the best of it. I wish it was my pleasant task this morning to inform you that Mr. H. was better, but it seems to us that he is very much the same that he has been for some months past. The sore, the swelling, and indeed all the symptoms continue pretty much the same. He suffers no pain and the only difficulty he has is shortness of breath produced by distension of the stomach pressing against the lungs. He is also very nervous which prevents him from sleeping as much as he ought. however we regard it as coming from the Lord and it is our prayer and wish always to say "Let him do as seemeth him good". His appettte continues good, he eats anything that he desires as his Physicians make no restrictions with regard to his food, and yet it is strange his strength does not increase. He is still unable to sit up even in the bed, and cannot turn himself without a little assistance. Not able to write even his name or else he would write to you. He is generally cheerful, and glad to see his friends. James pays him a visit once a week and Hannah once in two or three weeks, sometimes they bring the Children with them. James has entirely recovered his health and Hannah is very fleshy, weighing between 180 and 200 lbs. The weather with us has been for some time intensely cold it snowed now and then for nearly 3 or 4 days and there was quite good sleighing. You speak of being deprived of Church privileges in your new neighborhood. I can sympathize with you in this respect as Mr. H's continued illness has prevented me from attending public worship for a year and more, but we remember that the Lord is not confined to places, and we have his word to read and other good books, and in these and other private means of Grace we often realize that he has not forsaken us. Pray for us that our faith and patience may hold out, and (Part of a letter from Mrs. M. G. Hamilton to Mrs. D. G. Smith)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philad. Feb 22, 1855 My dear Eliza, You have 'ere this received from George full accounts of our health &amp; all that concerns us here, as we learnt yesterday, through Mrs. Blackford, that he reached the University on Saturday last ( the 17th). I had not supposed that we should get this information through an indirect channel, especially as he had promised his grandmother to write from Baltimore or Washington, if it was only five lines, to let her know whether Emily Robins had been able to got down the Chesapeake. He should be cautious in making promises, but when once made, they should be faithfully &amp; strictly fulfilled. I always thought a friend of Mr. Long's passed the highest encomium on him when he said that he (Long) was one of the very few men he had met with in life who always did a little more than he promised. I hope George will be diligent in improving the very great advantages of his present situation, both in attending Mr. Shaw, &amp; most of the others lectures. This is General Washington's birthday—which was ushered in by a salute of 31 guns. The Richmond Blues have come on by invitation to share in the festivities of the day. I sent a copy of my late work on the Census to C. Clay at Washington for George. I shall send one to the Doctor Mr. Broadus &amp; Mr. Smith. The Lowries, formerly of New York, &amp; now on a visit from England, supped with us last evening. Mrs. Outerbridge has lately added a little girl to her family, which now consists of four sons and four daughters. Tell Mary I ventured to buy the Chinese candlesticks as I thought they would be acceptable &amp; the price was low. I hope the china pleased her. You seemed to have been much pleased with Mr. Wise's speech at Charlottesville. He is no doubt an amusing &amp; sometimes fircible speaker—but one whom I dont much esteem. Extremely vain, as well as ambitious, he has been remarkably versatile both as to me &amp; measures, &amp; constant only to on purpose the advancement of Henry A Wise. Still I would prefer him as Governor to many who might be brought forward. Your mother sends her love. Remember me to the Doctor Mary, Maria, their husbands George &amp; the other children, in which your mother unites, &amp; believe me to be Your ever affectionate father George Tucker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Midway February 1855 My dear Sister: I intended writing to you last week, but was in one of my absent moods &amp; forgot to write in time for the mail. I am so much oblige to you for your kind letters, would that I could write oftener to you in order to get them more frequently. I must tell you tho' Sister that I thought the time long-very long between my last &amp; your answer. When one is due me from you I expect it very anxiously, forgetting all my shortcomings when in debt to you. I really feared that I had said something which had offended you, &amp; that you wd. not write again, but after reflecting I felt sure that if I had said any thing offensive you would have written the sooner for an explanation. Sister sometimes I am filled with feelings of desperation &amp; say &amp; do things which in my calmer moments cause me much distress &amp; if I should ever say or do anything calculated to wound or offend I pray-I beseech you think nothing of it-for mercy's sake pass it by unnoticed. I was going to tell you some of my sufferings of mind but I will not trouble you. God only knows what my fate will be. I sometimes trust in the mercy &amp; goodness of God, or at least try to do so, &amp; hope to obtain pardon &amp; justification &amp; even sanctification through the death &amp; glorious resurrection of our Lord &amp; Saviour Jesus Christ, but at other times. I may say nearly all the time, gloom, deep gloom &amp; darkness pervade my soul. Oh pray for me-ask for nothing for me but deliverance from sin-that lost &amp; ruined as I am, I may fall in the arms of my Saviour, &amp; have a bright &amp; full assurance that he is my Saviour &amp; that I am received of him. This is all I ask. Give me this &amp; sustaining grace &amp; I can cheerfully resign my all into his hands, &amp; then I shall have all that I desire. I have not heard from over the mountains for two weeks. When we last heard Aunt Baxter was very ill &amp; I fear greatly to hear the next tidings from her. Poor old lady she has had much affliction in this life &amp; I trust by it she has been purified-yea refined even as fine gold and made more mete to join with those who have gone up through great tribulations. I hope to hear from them by tomorrow's mail, &amp; that she is better. Should she be taken now, Mother would I fear not survive long. What a selfish creature I am, Oh may I be forgiven all. I saw merely a notice of Mrs. McCarty's death in the Charlottesville paper; but was not sure 'twas your friend until I received your letter. What a comfort to her husband &amp; friends to have such an assurance of her having exchanged the cares and sufferings of this life for the never fading joys of heaven. What else is there worth living for? The joys and pleasures of this world soon dio-friends fail &amp; return to their mother dust, &amp; poor frail creatures how could we live even here, say nothing of hereafter, without the comfort of Religion. Was Mrs. McCarty a member of any church? We are much concerned about our dear brother Gibson. He has been extremely ill of Pneumonia for two weeks-his life was despaired of; but during the last few days, his symptoms are more favourable &amp; we are hoping (almost against hope) that he will recover. He is aware of his danger &amp; says if he goes he will go in peace. 'Tis said that Mr. Littleton (his colleague) is in Richmond very ill of the same disease. I hope to hear soon of his convalescence. Truly is God sending his judgments through the land. When I commenced I thought I would write only a note, but have filled my sheet with I scarcely know what, &amp; there is much unsaid that I would like to say-but enough for the present. My love to Maria, Mary, Brother, Messrs Broadus &amp; Smith &amp; all. I hope to see you soon, but I cant say when-exactly when. I forgot to say before that I have been suffering very much of late, consulted Dr. Henderson-he advises me to consult Dr. Howard. I am very anxious to see him. All unite with me in sending love to you &amp; family. The children are both asleep. Affectionately your Sister M. F. Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">At Home February 27th 1855 My Dear Aunt I've been trying, ever since your letter came to hand, to answer it, but my efforts (as you'll perceive) have failed to produce a letter to you. Your letter came one rainy Sunday when I was returning from Church in the carriage with Aunt Lucy. I was very much obliged to you for writing me so long a letter in answer to my little short one. I knew when I wrote it was not worth sending, but sent it because it is a principal of economy with me never to take the trouble to write a letter I do not send. I was so sorry Uncle John didn't come to Fredericksburg while I was there—the schoolgirls were always wishing he would come. I was very sorry to leave so soon, but it was unavoidable, and I had to submit quitely. The day I came home was a wretched day—snowing constantly and very cold, but I did not care much for cold or storm as I was well protected with wraps. I've been very pleasantly engaged since my return nursing my little Sister Rosalie. She is one of the most beautiful babies that has ever been seen—has black eyes and hair and very symetrical features. She is very fat and laughs whenever you will talk to her a little. I almost fear to love the dear little one for fear, like my other idol, she may be torn from me. Jacky is in raptures all the time, and says he will have his Sister called "the sound of a trumpet". I Can't think where he got the impression, but you know he is an odd child any way. One day he and Tommie were playing going on journeys, &amp; Tommie said he was starting to France. Jacky said "Thomas give my best love to Napoleon, and please don't lose it." Mother has been quite well, but not so strong as she generally is. Tommie has, for the last week, been having an attack of Catarrh fever—he has been very sick, but is better now. It is very lonely here now—no parties—no any thing that is calculated to interest one at all. Everyone I know is married except Lute Hill and she is going to leave soon. Old Dr. Ashby is to be married soon—would you believe it. "They say" she is very wealthy indeed, but I can hardly think she will marry him, though I hope she may. Bettie Ward is still in New York and from what I can learn is cutting "quite a dash". New Year's day she was dressed in a lemon coloured silk dress—very bare arms and low neck—quite gay don't you think so? She has promised to get married and invite me to spend a winter with her. It is the most fashionable thing you could imagine to board at the "Waverly Hotel", the whole town has gone there. Bettie Storrow's beau still visits her, and of course she will be married before long. Cousin Virginia Broadus is engaged to be married to a very nice man in Luray and will go home soon, and then be married and come back to live. Brother and Sister left yesterday for the "far West". They seemed happy at the idea of going, and I said no word in objection, though I felt very sad at parting from them for so long a time. Brother was very much pleased with his visit to you. They are all well at Mr. Bickers's, but I have not been able to go there yet. All send love to all. My love to Uncle and kisses to the little ones. Write soon to Your loving niece Mary (RSH)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore MdMar 7 Miss Mary J. HarrisonHarrisonburg Rockingham County Baltimore March 6 1855 My Dear Cousin Mary I fully intended answering your very kind letter last week, but was so much occupied in nursing after Marys nurse left that I had not much time for anything, so I had to put it off until to-day Mary is doing very well, the babe is growing finely, it is a very fat plump little creature, and cries but very little only when it has the cholic and that is not very often. She thinks of coming down stairs the last of the week if nothing prevents. Anna Bell is very fond of the Baby as she calls her, she is not the least jealous of it, she is a great deal fonder of her Father than her Mother, cries for him every time he goes out. Mary says that is just what he wants her to do he was afraid she would not think as much of him as she did of her, she sleeps with him every night and has ever since Mary has been sick. I wish you could hear her calling me Aunty when she wants me to give her my Basket that is a great eyesore to her, and her great delight is to spread the things over the floor. She is a very cunning little tad. I tell her to call Willie she says Willie very sweet. Mary said Yesterday she wished I would stay with her all summer, but I guess I cant stay away from the Burg so long as that. I will want to see you too bad for anything if I stay so long as that. Do you think I had better stay or not give me your advice on the subject. I was sorry to hear that Aunt Polly had taken cold by going to see Aunt Baxter. I hope they are both better by this time, Yes well. I was very sorry to hear that Mary Rush was still so complaining and that Dear little Minnie had been so sick. I do hope she is well again. Has Addie &amp; Minnie been over yet. I wish they would wait until I get back then I could see them too. Tell Willie I do want to see her too bad for any use. She is still my little Pet. ask her what I must bring her when I come home. You say that you are sorry that I bought you two Dresses. Why didnt you let Margaret have the Raw silk then as she was so anxious for one. Then I could have gotten you a summer dress of some kind. I wish now that I had saved the money, as you regret spending anything to supply your wants. If you all want me to get things for you send me a list by John Graham or Miss Bettie, and do measure the Passage and let me see what I can get a oil Cloth for. I think we need one very much. I wish you would send me my white Cape. I have half a notion to have it coloured if I thought it would look nice, but I dont like dyed silk, they look mighty poor I think, if you think it will do to wear this summer dont send it for I do hate coloured goods. Mr Bell &amp; Maupin was to see me last night. Mr Maupin invvited vited me down to Mr Hurst to look at the new goods, said they had just gotten in some very nice Tissues he said he would sell me one cheap, now if you want Dresses just say what kind and I will try and get them to please if I possibly can. I intend getting several dresses for myself before I leave. I have been thinking very seriously of getting a green and white silk plaid for this summer. Would you or would you not. I see some very handsome Dress goods in the windows to tempt people to buy. if only my pocket was heavy couldnt I buy nice things now that I see so many. if you want Gaiters just send the money I can get them without the least trouble. Why is Margaret so busy making shirts now, is William going to Texas this Spring.for sure. I saw John Harnsberger on his way to Iowa. he gave me a good deal of news. I am generally very well posted in the affairs of home. I shant know where to find some of the people when I get home there will have been so many changes. I heard Mrs McMurren had concluded not to take Georges house. it will be quite a disappointment to Die, as she had set her Heart on Boarding. If I have an opportunity I will send M sleeves and those Handkerchiefs, if Rucy wants one too I will get it with pleasure if she sends me the money. mine wont hold out to but so many things, and if I dont I will bring them myself. I am very glad to hear that our Choir is in such a flourishing condition, hope it will continue. Conference sits tomorrow. I think I will go sometimes it is so far I dont think I will get there very often, but I must go cometime to say that I have been to Conference. I wonder if our Bro William will be here I would like to see him very much. do you ever hear from him. I do wonder what has become of the letters he promised to write me, he aint clever for treating me so. Has that old Bureau of mine arrived yet; if it has I wish you would get John Foster to fix it up a little not to cost much. I would like to have it to store away some of my rags. Tell John Graham &amp; William Berry I will write soon. I would write more but I intend going out this evening to pay some visits, it is such a pleasant evening to walk around. Mary &amp; Dill join with me in love to you all. give my respects to Bro Clark. how sorry I was to hear of Mr Gibsons death, another good man gone home to rest. I am looking every day for a letter from Caroline &amp; Margaret. tell Willie I send her a lot of kisses. how is Clarissa well and fattening or not. I hear that all the new married folks are fattening very fast. Tell Margaret not to follow their example if she pleases. Give my love to all who inquire for me. I often think of home &amp; home folks. Write soon, very soon. When you write over the Mountains give them a great deal of love for me.

      <field name="fulltext">Harrisonburg March 27th 1855 My Dear Brother Ma received your kind letter sometime since, and has been very anxious to have it answered before this. if she could write herself you would hear from her more frequently than you do I have no doubt. She has been very much indisposed for a week past. She took a violent cold by some means which affected her like the croup, she had besides some symtoms of bronchitis, she spit some blood one or two days it alarmed her a good deal, but perhaps it was an advantage to her. She has not had so much pain as usual with these spells, but has been very sick, &amp; still is very sick at her stomach. she is very sleepy &amp; drousy but the cough medicine may produce that effect, it has a good deal of morphia in it. she cough almost incessantly one day &amp; was compeled to use it very freely. She is I hope better, though not able to sit up at all, &amp; I trust will soon be in her usual health. I wish she could have more repose. She allows the concerns of life to worry her so much. She is so nervous &amp; irratable that nothing scarcely goes right about her. She has a very unmanageable set to deal with it is true but if she would take things more quietly perhaps it would be as well. We have Sukey at home to add to her trials. William had hired her out, but after trying her a month, she was sent home by William's consent. The girl at the hotel has been a losing business in every way. she has become more worthless than ever, &amp; then we will not get her hire. Mr. Mauck refuses to pay it till her physicians bill is paid, and what do you think that is? Dr. Butler sent in a bill of thirty six dollars for services rendered her during the year. We did not know she was ill enough to require a physician but once or twice, &amp; then but for a short time. Ma is unwilling for it to be paid. Says he must sue her first, &amp; this year she has lost the hire of her. She could hire by the week, but she is not willing to do that. We could find employment for her, but Ma thinks it is to expensive to keep so many servants about her, these hard times. I still hope we may get her a home in the country, it would be much better for her. We are expecting every day the little black children to take the measles. William Berry had them and Tom was obliged to wait on him. he has been sick with a cold. Emma is quite sick to-day. She has had a cold for sometime, I hope it will not prove to be anything severe. There is a great deal of sickness about here. Typhoid Pneumonia is prevailing more than for three years, but not many fatal cases. The weather is very cold and disagreeable every body almost has a cold &amp; hoarseness. Margaret &amp; Willie have both been sick with colds. Margaret feared Willie would have the croup but she has escaped an attack though not well yet. Mr, Rodes &amp; Addie got here Saturday evening. We were very glad to see them. They will remain till the last of the week. We wish Minna could have come with them. She would have been a great comfort to her Grandma. We are looking for Fannie home this week, her brother wished her to stay with them, but she prefers being with us, &amp; Miss Bettie gives her as good wages as she could get there. Aunt Baxter is improving she goes about the house, but has not been down to see us yet. Lizzie Scott's daughter who is in this country called to see us this evening. her Mother has declined visiting her friends here on account of I am sorry I would have liked so much to have seen her. We were glad to hear Lida Broadus was recovering we were very anxious about her, we did not know Anna had been sick, till I received Sister's last letter. I hope she is quite well now. We were truly glad to hear you were recovering of your cold, &amp; those disagrecable boils you were afflicted with. I hope your health will now be good, so that you will be able to get through the session with comfort. Caroline wishes me to say to Mary she will write to her soon. I hope she will receive benefit from the remedies she is using. Give our love to her &amp; the children. I am very glad Lucie escaped with so slight an injury. I hope there will be no scars. Ma &amp; Caroline join me in much love to yourself, Sister, Maria, Mary, Rosalie &amp; the boys. Your affectionate Sister Mary Jane</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. April 2nd 1855 Dear Sis E. Yours of the 23 ult arrived safe. We were glad to hear of your continued good health and prosperity. I wish we could say the same with regard to ourselves as a whole. Yet do not understand me as complaining of the dealings of Providence towards us. On the contrary we have much for which to be thankful. My own health and that of E. R. has been very good all the winter. This has been a great blessing to me, as I have been able more entirely to attend to Mr. H. His condition is about the same as when I wrote last, the sore is not doing much, the swelling is sometimes very great, and sometimes not so bad. At present it is less than for some days past. His cough does not trouble him much but his weakness still continues. He is still unable to turn himself in bed without assistance. He is still calmly and patiently trying to suffer all his Master's will amd expects to conquer even the last enemy, and to shout victory through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. At times I hope he will be raised up from his sickness and be restored to me and his friends again. O that this might be the case, it would be almost like receiving him from the grave. Yet I remember that nothing is too hard for the Lord to do, and in him is my only hope. I believe he will do what is best for us and for his own glory, and "never will I remove out of his hands our cause" either temporally or spiritually, but trust to his love and mercy, that all will be right. Continue to remember us at a throne of grace. Pa appears to be better, though his cough is very troublesome. The rest of the family are well. James was here yesterday and brought a letter from your Cousin Mrs. Hinton, except some rheumatism her health has been better than usual the past winter, but they are in great distrese on account of the death of her Son William's wife whom she desoribes as a very interesting lady. The wife of her son Erasmus is now in very bad health and they are uneasy on her account. Although the tenor of the letter is rather gloomy yet the old Lady is sustained by a strong faith in the goodness and love of her heavenly Father. She sends a great deal of love, and hopes to meet and know all her Father's relations in a brighter and better world than this. (Part of a letter from Mrs. M. G. Hamilton to Mrs. D. G. Smith)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University April 18th 1855 My dear Mary Jane, I was greatly concerned to hear Mother was so much of an invalid still. We had hoped she was improving in health, as the weather became more mild and settled. Your brother has had a very severe attack of inflammation in the face, which caused him a great deal of suffering. You may recollect he has had several similar attacks, but this has been one of the most obstinate. I am thankful to say, he is now in his usual health &amp; would like so much to visit Mother, if he possibly can make his arrangements to do so, I am sure he will, but he lost a good deal of time from his sickness, which of course makes him exceedingly busy now. If Mother should get no better, I sometimes think I must go and see her myself, but I trust she may improve, and that we shall have better tidings of her in your next letter. Mary Harrison is now in Charlottesville. Dr. Harrison saw her and Maria on the street yesterday. She has been suffering a vast deal from the tartar emetic ointment on her back, but I hope in a short time she will be able to see come benefit resulting from the means she is using. She will return the last of this week to the University to remain soem time longer I believe. She went last Saturday to Mr. Stovens' and I suppose will divide her time between her &amp; Maria. Mrs. Keblinger with whom she intends staying some part of the time, has recently lost her mother. Sister Maria has recently passed a few days with me. She is looking very well, but was obliged to return soon, as it is so busy a season in the country. Mary thinks her eyes are improving. She has weaned her little girl, who is running all about. We heard with great pain of dear Margaret's affection of the eye. I trust most devoutly she may not lose the sight. How much I wish I could help to beguile the tedium of her confinement. It is as you observed a sad privation, and one which awakens in my bosom a deeper sympathy than almost any other bodily affliction. I pray most sincerely that the Good Being may see fit to avert so heavy a calamity, and that she may soon be relieved of this painful malady. They are going on quite rapidly with the Parsonage. I suppose it will be completed by September for Mr. Broadus. I sometimes fear that just as we get our children settled around us, we shall be obliged to go away. It is pretty hard living here now. Dr. Harrison is making nothing at all for his family. Unless some changes are made I am sure he will not remain here. With much love to Mother, Margaret, Caroline and Fannie, I am ever your affectionate sister E. L. C. Harrison P. S. You regretted not inviting George to Harrisonburg, but he could not possibly have gone. He is again deeply immersed in study, and has nothing to encourage him in the profession he has chosen. Such numbers are pursuing the same occupation, and the times so hard it is impossible to get a place, Even the best Engineers are now out of employment. He is afraid he will be obliged to teach school, whic he abhors. It is now the only way to make money. Mr. Joynes went over the mountains with the intention of going to Harrisonburg, but was taken sick in Staunton, and has not yet returned. Both he and I took cold the night of the celebration. I was really very sick Saturday night, and felt that I was somewhat imprudent in going out Sunday, but could not resist the pleasure of hearing Dr. Alexander preach, who gave us two delightful sermons on Sunday. I feel now pretty well again. Yours ever, E. H.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. April 23rd 1855 Dear Sis E. We received your joint letter on Saturday morning. It found Mr. H. about the same. We are thankful that he is no worse although he does not appear to be any better. The Abscess for a week or so has been discharging more than for some time past. He does not gain any strength, and his weakness combined with the swelling keep him as helpless as an infant. His appetite continues good, and he rests tolerably well at night. I was in hopes that as the spring opened and the weather became warmer he would be able to sit up, but judging from a day or two last week when it was very warm, I am afraid it will not have a very beneficial effect upon him, but I will not borrow trouble on interest, believing that "sufficient for the day is the evil thereof". I saw a notice in the paper that the Adams &amp; Co. Express that failed in San Francisco was not connected with the one through this region, and if they have a bar attached to the Railroad passing through C. Mr. H. says there would be no risk in sending by it, but if there is not a bar belonging to them, he thinks there may be some uncertainty about the eggs reaching him and you better not send them, and he will take the will for the deed. Write soon. We all join in love to you and yours, yr aff Sister Eliza P. Hamilton (I am in a great hurry, you must excuse this)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. May 12th 1855 Dear Sis E. We received yours a day or two ago, and altho I am very much fatigued yet I will hastily write you a line or so before night. Mr. H. has been rather more unwell yesterday and today. I was up with him the greater part of the night. He is very nervous and less able to bear pain than he was sometime ago. The swelling is confined chiefly to the stomach and lower limbs. On Tuesday last we placed him on a patent bed made for the sick, which would raise him up in a sitting posture by means of cords and pulleys, or raise him entirely from the bed, when he would be suspended as in a hammock, and a good many other advantages, but like every other patent invention we found the disadvantages more than equal, so after giving it a fair trial we placed him on his own bed again much to his relief. We do not wish you to trouble yourselves about the eggs, as they are now plenty and very cheap with us. When Mr. H. sent that little note they were very scarce, and brought a high price as it was about Easter and during Lent. You know the Catholics must have them at any price. I have not time to say more, but will write again soon. The rest of us are well, for which we are thankful. Write soon. Our love to all—in haste yr aff Sis E. P. Hamilton (Mrs. M. G. Hamilton to Mrs. D. G. Smith)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Thursday May 17th 1855 Dear Sis E. I wrote you on Saturday that Mr. H. was more unwell. On Sabbath he was alarmingly ill, and since then he has been gradually sinking. He suffers intensely on account of the pressure of water on the lungs, and when awake is very restless constantly desiring to change his position which his great weakness prevents His mind is clear and in perfect peace, he frequently in the midst of severe suffering breaks out in exclamations of praise to his redeemer. He realizes his situation and says"his prospect for the future life is bright and now though he can only talk of his Saviour he will soon see and enjoy him forever". Pray for us that in this trying ordeal we may be kept by the power of God. Some of our friends think he may rally again, but I am almost beyond hope. your afflicted Sister E. P. Hamilton Should any change take place you will be immediately informed of it.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philadelphia. May 18, 1855 My dear Eliza, I am now two letters in your debt, and was about to write to you about a week ago, but after your mother, about that time, wrote to George, I postponed my letter. I was truly sorry to hear that the Doctor's boil continued to persecute him. It is however much better that the noxious matter of the system should pass off in that form than in a fever or a chronic disease. I think Mary is right in trying some watering place for the affection in her eyes. I fear that Mr. Smith will not be able to meet with any lectures on geology. The few that are delivered on that subject in the U. S. are comprehended in some general course, which will have been over by the time he comes on. He must then rely on his own reading, aided as he may be by conferring with the Rogers's or other geologists. As Mrs. Pollard has not yet received the parcel sent to her by Prosser Harrison, I would be obliged to George if he would learn from his friend to whom he confided the parcel, &amp; let me know immediately. I am glad to hear that he has some prospect of employment as an engineer. Should he however be disappointed, let him not be discouraged, for the suspension of those works which require engineering science is but temporary. I was glad to hear of Lucy Downing's good fortune. I presume her rumoured liaison still continues. The scarcity of provisions of which you speak is universal. The price of meat of all kinds is so dear in this market, that the poorer class is not able to buy it. Mutton 14 cents, Beef from 12 to 29 cents. I have several times been obliged to give 50 cents a pound for butter. Should there be another short crop, the consequences would be appalling. But the prospect of a good crop if grain is good in almost every part of the country. I hear that Lorenzo Lewis's widow is now in Philadelphia but I have not seen her. This day fortnight we set out for the Eastern Shore &amp; expect to continue there until the 1st of July, when we again bend our course to the North—probably Newport, though it is not acsolutely certain. Tutwiler's two daughters are here attending Mrs. Trist's school. One of them has been to see us, but I was out &amp; did not see her. The Episcopal convention for the state is now in Convention. They have been discussing the propriety of permitting a black preacher to take a scat among them. The Bishop was strongly in favor of it. Dr. Ducuchet as strongly opposed to it—&amp; J. Wilmer our former chaplain made a great speech also in opposition. I wonder if the Bishop would be willing to let his daughter be married to a "black Brother" however unexceptionable in other respects. I think that a large part of the civilized world are crazed on this subject of African slavery. Apropos! I was sorry to read a few days since in a newspaper that a sister of Mrs. Beecher Stowe had had been insulted at the University with a mock serenade, &amp; that the same occasion was thought a fitting one for burning her sister in effigy. The article was headed " Virginia Chivalry". Pray let me know the particulars. Your mother's health is still very delicate—but I trust I trust that a visit to her native county, &amp; her relatives will prove beneficial to her. She desires her love to you &amp; all the rest of your family. I do the same &amp; am your ever affectionate father George Tucker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">REV. MATTHEW G. HAMILTON The Preachers' Meeting of the M. E. Church, of this city, appointed Rev. B. N. Brown a committee to draft something suitable on the death of our esteemed brother, Rev. Matthew G. Hamilton, which occurred in this city May 19th, 1852, at the residence of Dr. Davis, his wife's step-father. In compliance with the resolution, he submitted the following, which was adopted, with the request that it be published in our Christian Advocate and Journal. Thomas Myers, Sec. Strawbridge Parsonage, Baltimore, June 11. MATTHEW GREENTREE HAMILTON was born in Leesburg, Loudon County, Virginia, on March 29, 1810. At a camp-meeting held about four miles south of Leesburg, and on Sept. 5th, 1827, he was born again, not of the will of the flesh, nor of man, but of the Spirit of God. He immediately assumed the personal responsibilities of membership in the Methodist Episcopal Church, and was soon appointed to the charge of a class. Having been licensed to exhort, he was, in the winter of 1835, employed by the presiding elder to supply the demands of a circuit; and the following spring was received on trial in the Baltimore Annual Conference, and appointed to Woodstock Circuit. He continued in active service until 1850, when he was compelled from failing health to ask a supernumerary relation. For a short time during that relation he resumed with great cheerfulness the duties of an effective man. But it was short. A malignant disease, hitherto rather latent, now developed itself, and for sixteen months of uninterrupted confinement to bed its wasting hand grappled with a constitution of unusual vigor, till the strong man bowed to the stroke of a mighty foe. A singular tenacity of life, combined with a vigorous constitution, subjected our brother to an extraordinary degree of suffering in the progress of disease. If humanity can be made perfect through suffering, then indeed was the work of salvation finished in him. We are witnesses of his patience and suffering. No paroxysm of pain, however, extorted from him a murmur. The spirit of cheerfulness, so characteristic of him as a man, remained unchanged during the whole of his protracted illness. As a preacher, brother Hamilton possessed, among other elements of usefulness and power, one of rare attainment—the power of exhortation—a talent with which so few are endowed even to mediocrity: it was possessed by him, with but little rivalry in our conference— an element of success this which told with signal effect upon the people to whom he ministered, and the hundreds gathered into the Church during the fourteen years of his active service. In his intercourse with society, such was the pervading influence of his cheerful spirit, united with a generousness of feeling and courtesy of manner, that his memory will be sacredly cherished by the extended circle of acquaintances formed during his itinerant ministry. At the late period of great trial in the history of our Church in Leesburg, he rendered most essential service by personal exertions and responsibilities, which contributed to relieve the property from embarrassment. The severity and tediousness of the sickness through which he passed, afforded ample opportunity to test the power of Christianity, and to give triumph to the soul amid the fire of affliction. Though he had everything to live for that makes life desirable, yet he rejoiced in constant hope of a glory yet to be revealed. "Glory", said he one day to his wife, "was the first word I uttered after my conversion, and I expect it will be the last I shall speak when leaving the world!" It was true: the last word was "glory," and the radiance left upon his countenance spoke in silent majesty the triumph of the soul after the spirit had gone to God. His domestic relations, as husband and father; the ceaseless watchings, the ministrations, like an angel of mercy, performed by a devoted wife, and the outflow of affection's tears, must delineate a character which the pencil cannot trace. In paying this tribute to the memory of our dear fellow-labourer, we most heartily offer our sympathies to his more heavily bereaved family and friends, and, in earnest prayer, commend them to the "Husband of the widow, and the Father of the fatherless." B. N. Brown (Matthew G. Hamilton was the brother of the 3rd Mrs. Daniel Grove Smith of Morven. Attached to this clipping was a sketch of his tombstone done by his daughter, Eliza Ridgeley Hamilton (Uhler) with the following written on it by his wife " This is drawn by Lidie from memory. Rather rough but will give you the idea. This is the Tomb or headstone. It is about 8 ft. high." These were sent to Mrs. Smith.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Baltimore May 21st 1855 Dear Sis E. Thinking you would like to hear the particulars of the last hours of my beloved husband I will try to school myself to the task and give you such information as you will be thankful to hear. On last friday week he appeared to be much more unwell than usual and on Sabbath he was extremely ill being in constant agonizing pain all day—towards evening he was somewhat relieved but perfectly prostrated—his sufferings during the last week were intense but he bore it with great submission and patience. He was perfectly rational to the last and conversed freely about his prospects for the future. He enjoyed much of the presence and favour of his Saviour and his confidence in his goodness seemed to increase hourly. In the midst of severe pain and anguish of body, he would break out in rapturous praises and even call upon those around to join him in praising God for all his mercy towards him. On Tuesday morning after being raised in the bed to have his pillow arranged he nearly swooned away from weakness—before he was entirely relieved he said "Glory and honour be ascribed to him forever who hath loved us and washed us in his own blood" and turning to me he said 'cant you say so. Let all the people say so. Mr. Jarrett coming in at this instant he held his hand out to him exclaiming Glory to God. O how sweet, to be complete in him who died for me. This happy state of mind continued to the last. Bish op Waugh visited him on Thursday. He held an animated conversation with him on the glories of the better land, and said the doctrines he had preached to others now fully sustained him, and disclaiming all merit he said when he came to die he wanted no other plea save " I the chief of Sinners am but Jesus died for me". At another time he said ` I can talk of my Saviour now but I shall soon see him and enjoy him forever'. Again he said `O perfect joy! O glorious hope!' Expressions similar to these were constantly falling from his lips. The closing scene was very peaceful, not a muscle moved and as the last breath passed from his lips a bright smile flitted over his face giving it a most heavenly expression which continued to the closing of the coffin. He looked more natural than he had done for months. He was buried by the side of our beloved children. 6 of the Ministers were pallbearers, L. F. Morgan, Geo, Brooke, Sam'l Register, Wm. Harden, John C. Dice and Wm. Hank. Nearly all the stationed Ministers attended his funeral with a large number of friends. John Bear officiated assisted by Mr. N. Wilson. I have thus endeavoured to give you an account of his last hours. To describe my own feelings I shall not attempt. E. R. is well and is greatly grieved at the loss of her dear Papa. We are all as well as could be expected. Although I know that my great loss is his unspeakable gain, yet I feel momentarily the necessity to pray for submission to this severe dispensation from my heavenly Father. I would not murmur, when I remember the severe suffering which he endured is now over forever, but no tongue can tell how much I miss him—our every thought was shared by each other. To whom shall I now go for counsel or advice. Yet I remember there is one who has promised to be a Father to the fatherless and a husband to the Widow. To him I look and on him alone I depend. That his grace which has sustained me thus far may continue to support and comfort me and mine pray for us. Write soon, in great affliction Yr aff Sister E. P. Hamilton I forgot to mention that my dearest love directed me to give his love to all his friends and tell them to hold on their way and meet him in the kingdom</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Ellen E. Smithnear Charlottsville Albemarle Co. Va.care of Mr. D. G. Smith Balto. Md May 30 1855 Dear Madam As there are but two that now live who were once members of a large family, the parents, and nearly all of the children have gone to a better world than the one we inhabit, each one, before bidding adieu to earth, gave undeniable proof of the happy change wrought upon the heart. It becomes me, (as the only male left) to say a few words in relation to the very unnecessary, and I might say, sinfull course pursued by us for several years past, and as we wish atlast to meet those who have died happily saved by gracem we should try the very few days we shall yet live in this world of sorrow, to amend our course, especially towards each other. We should mutually consent to look over the past. I have had my sorrows long &amp; many. The afflictions of various kinds &amp; sometimes very heavy, thro' which I have passed, astonishes me when I think of them that I yet live. I feel almost entirely alone in this life, were it not for my little family a wife &amp; three children I should feel very little concern about anything below the skies. I have been in this large &amp; growing city nearly eight years, and more than two years of that time lying upon my sick bed several times supposed to be dieing, and now enjoy once again good health, altho my afflictions have been very severe I nevertheless feel grateful to God for his unbounded goodness to me &amp; mine. I have not known at any time of my life the need of friends so certainly as I have the past winter, my means being limited &amp; every thing so high in price, and my health feeble. Now that I have regained my health I hope to put forth more exertion and be better able to meet the necessities of our little charge. Poor Eliza feels very much the loss of her Husband. Mat died triumphlenty. Eliza was untireing in her attention. She manifested more of heartfelt devotion than any one I ever knew. She is a good woman, &amp; an affectionate wife, during his long illness she was truly constant in every attention. I pray God we may all atlast meet in Heaven. Your Bro Ja.s L. Hamilton 172 Monument St Mrs. Ellen E. Smith My dear Ellen It is all most dark but I could not bear the idea of letting this letter start without saying a few words myself. I regret very much I did not know that you and your Husband was here. I should have gone to see both of you, and thought hard of your not comeing to see us. I want you to see our children. We have Betty, Maulsby and Pink. I have taught them to call you aunt Ellen and uncle Smith and to love you both. Betty and Maulsby are up at Ma's and will remain there untill fall. Betty has grown to be quite a large girl speaks french and performs remarkably well on the piano. We are not able to own one but have rented one for her. She often talks of you and wants to see you. I have promised her that she should pay you and her uncle Smith a visit when she is grown. She is thought to be very much like you. How is Howard he is nearly grown by this time. Remember me to Mr. Smith and family. I shall be glad to hear from you at any time and hope to see you both here. My dear Ellen the times are very hard. We have seen a great deal of trouble, but when I see you I shall tell you all. Write soon. I remain as ever your sister. H. E. H. When Betty comes home she shall write to you both. I reckon you can make out to read this I could not see.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia June 3, 1855 My dear Mother, I know that you will be pleased to hear that we are all, through a merciful providence enjoyed pretty good health. Eliza has had a bad cold, attended with a severe cough, but is nearly recovered; and so with Rosalie. I have been much better myself in my general health the past week or more, and have been in that time freed from the boils which confined me so much during the winter and spring. Although much occupied, I have found opportunity to get some exercise, and this no doubt has done me more good than any thing else. The Baptist association for Virginia has been in session in Charlottesville since thursday, and a great crowd has been in attendance. I believe that every body has found some place to eat and sleep, almost every house being filled more or less. We have had five very good and agreeable persons until this evening, when we have six, two of them ministers. I understand the preaching has been generally very good. We had two very good sermons in the Chapel today. It is very pleasant to become acquainted with persons of other denominations who have genuine piety. It helps to make us more charitable, and to remove prejudices. The last news we had from you represented you as suffering very much. I trust that you may be better before this time. Above all I trust that you have become more and more convinced that the grace of God is sufficient for you, and that you faith grows stronger and stronger. The great secret is to put all our confidence in our Great Redeemer-to cast ourselves continually at the foot of the Cross, and by humble believing prayer to make known our wants to Him. I have not heard whether Mary has gone over the mountains yet. She looked very feeble when last I saw her. With much love to all the family, &amp; to Aunt Baxter. Yr. son, affectionately, Gessner Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">University of Virginia June 10. 1855 My dear Mother, Although I have nothing of interest to communicate, beyond the fact that we are all in pretty good health, except Mary, who is still suffering with her eyes, I thought I would write a few lines to you tonight, knowing that I may have hardly any opportunity of writing again before the end of the month. I have so many examinations papers to read that I begin to fear that I may not be able to complete them in time. Eliza chanced to meet Mr. Rodes in town friday, and from him learned that Mary and the children had reached Harrisonburg in safety. I am glad that you will have this comfort, and trust that Mary's health also may be improved. Tommy Rodes reported that you were still very feeble. Tommy Harrison called a few minutes friday. He had seen Margaret before leaving home, &amp; said she was much better, not only in her eyes, but also in her face. I would be glad to visit you sooner, but cannot get away before July. Mary talks of going to try Rawley's Springs. If so I shall endeavor to arrange it to carry her over with me. I was sorry not to be able to see Mr. Clarke, as I would have been glad to make his acquaintance. I have written this not knowing whether Eliza had already acknowledged the receipt of the box which Mr. Clarke was so kind as to bring, and the good things it contained. They were very acceptable, as is every thing in the way of provisions. Unfortunately the eggs were all broken in the carrying. We have never seen such scarcity. And yet up to this time we have always had something. Besides the scarcity is the enormous price of every thing to eat. For young chickens, about the size of partridges they have been asking a shilling, but since the `association' is past, I believe the price is reduced to 12½ cents. The price of butter was lately 37½ cents. I believe that also has come down, probably to 25 cents. At such prices I cannot see how most people are to make ends meet. Flour is $14.50. Even if we have good crops, the price is likely to be high. We must learn not be anxious about these things, but to trust more than we have done to a kind providence. May be it is designed to teach us this lesson. We ought to be more grateful, and to remember more than we do how dependant we are upon our Heavenly Father for life and all things. Above all we should trust Him for his grace, and commit all our ways to Him. Please give my love to all the family, including Fanny, and Aunt Baxter, and believe me Ever affectionately yr. son, Gessner Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. D. G. SmithCharlottesville Albemarle County Va. Balt. June 18th 1855 Dear Sis E. I received yours of the 8th inst. also the one written a few weeks before. I should have replied to your former letter but I have been very much engaged and my mind has been occupied with other things, but I will now devote a short time to you. I am thankful to hear you are all well. I hope your health may be preserved. My own health and that of E. R. is very good, and though in the midst of very severe affliction I have not been forsaken of my Heavenly Father, yet I feel my loss more deeply every day. For more than 12 years he had shared my every joy and sorrow, and when affliction and death visited our little circle and tore from our embrace our beloved Children, he, by his cheerful submission to the Will of our heavenly Father and his strong confidence in his unerring wisdom and goodness, helped me to bear their loss, and taught me to acquiesce in the dispensation of Providence—but now I drink the bitter cup alone and am bereft of my greatest and dearest earthly blessing.How desolate and empty this world appears. My Lilie is all that I have left to me of my own immediate family. O may I have grace given me to supply to her in some degree the loss of her dear, dear Papa, and train her up in the fear of the Lord. It is my earnest prayer that she may early be brought to choose her Father's God for her God and Guide, and that she may walk in the narrow way of Life all her days and be a useful member to the Church and community, wherever her lot may be cast—and then may she hope to be reunited with her dear Father and friends again, when the toils of life are o'er, on that blissful shore where parting is no more. Our friends are very kind and attentive and I feel grateful to the good Lord for so many alleviations to my sorrow, My greatest comfort is to sit down and commune with my own heart upon the many precious hours we have passed together in this room and call to remembrance sayings and expressions with which he would comfort and encourage me—and at the same time would endeavour to prepare me for that which has now come upon me. I find it no easy task to resign one so fondly loved—and who was so loving, affectionate and indulgent as he was to me—but while I mourn I try not to murmur. I know that to him the change is unspeakable gain, and I cannot in my selfish grief wish him back again to his suffering and pain. I feel a bright hope that we shall meet again, and together praise our Saviour &amp; Redeemer for all that he has done for us. And when we meet on that eternal shore there will be no more parting, nor sickness, nor pain nor sorrow nor crying nor death—but we shall enjoy the society of each other without the fear of seperation. I will give you a quotation from hervey which has been almost constantly on mind, "I know thou art gone to the home of the rest Then why should my soul be (stamp torn out.E.D.G.) I know thou art where the And the Mourner looks up, Where Love has put off, in the land of its birth The stains it had gathered in this, And Hope the sweet Singer that gladdened the Earth Lies asleep on the bosom of bliss. In the hush of the night-on the waste of the Sea Or alone with the breeze on the hill There is ever a presence that whispers of thee, And my spirit lies down and is still." I feel that it is my duty to submit to the dealings of Providence towards me and though His ways are mysterious, I will endeavour to commit myself, my Child and all our interests to his keeping—who chastises us for our profit—feeling that it is our Father who smites us—and must do it for our good. Pray for us that we may still trust in the Lord and that his grace may support and sustain us. Ma and the family unite in love to you all. E. R. sends her love. She would like very much to see you.

      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Mary S. Smith Care of John Siter &amp; SonRawley Springs Harrisonburg July 11th 1855 My dear wife I arrived here about sunset yesterday evening, after a tolerably pleasant ride. I went first to the tavern &amp; took my supper, &amp; then to the post office to mail the letters. I found all well at Grandma Harrison's. She invited insisted on my staying with her, and consequently I occupied last night the room of Mr. Clark, who has gone on a visit to Rockbridge. I retired about 11 o'clock, and commenced reading an old magazine, which I picked up on the table. After becoming immorsed in this for some time, (every body else in the house being in bed) I was somewhat startled by a snore from under the bed. I seized tthe tongs, lifted the curtains, &amp; by dint of punching, succeeded in expelling a negro boy (son of the cook here I believe) who was there for mischief I presume. I have said nothing about it to the family. Your pa &amp; family intend spending a day with you, but when I cannot say. I tried to persuade Mrs. B. by the offer of paying all her expenses, to remain with you, but did not succeed. Your pa intends returning next Friday week, -that is on the 19th of this month. Mr. Broadus will come over soon after &amp; return with Mrs. B. to Charlottesville during the first part of the subsequent week. So you can take your choice, with which party you will go back. I shall leave $50 with your pa. He will arrange your board bill etc. If you stay till Friday the 19th your bill with Sites would amount to something like $24, that is if he charges $8 the first week &amp; $7 the second. You ought to have $20 &amp; over left, after getting to the University, with which you could pay Mrs. Fife etc. I shall see the shoemaker this morning about the shoes-but I fear there will be no chance of getting them to Rawloy today. I will try to do what I can. Give my love to the young ladies, or if that is not proper my best regards. I came away from you with a reluctant heart, and am yet painfully undecided as to the propriety of an absence from you for so long a time. I trust however I am not doing a thing which is palpably wrong. Take great care of yourself. Don't fatigue yourself. Let Eliza do her own walking as far as you are concerned. Kiss her many times for me. My Warmest affection to you, my dear, Your truly attached husband F. H. Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Watertown. New York, July 19th 1855 My dear Mary I wrote to you last from Burlington I think. Tuesday morning we left that place &amp; crossed Lake Champlain in a steamboat, landing at a place called Port Kent. Where procuring seats in a stage we were set down at the Ausable river, 3 miles distant a few yards from the stage road, we came suddenly upon an enormous gorge, 200 feet deep, yet not more than 30 wide, fissured out of the solid sandstone. Clmabering down this chasm, thro' which the river flows, we made our first essay at breaking rooks. I was so fortunate as to be the first to find the small shell we were searching for. I think the sight of this enormous fissure, with the dtriking scenery it presents, would have alone repaid me for my whole journey. We went next day further up the lake to Chazy landing &amp; thence into the country again, to see what is termed the Chazy Limestone &amp; to gather its fossils, in which we succeeded pretty well. Last night we went in an open wagon to Champlain, and after a night of roasting in a hot attic room, rose this morning pretty well wilted. We came today 114 miles by railway from Champlain to Ogdenburg, across the northern portion of New York within sight of Canada. Thence 75 miles by steamer up the St Lawrence river to Cape Vincent, on the border of Lake Ontario. From C.V. we came by railway this evening to this place, and are housed in an excellent hotel. On our way up the river we passed through the farfamed thousand isles of the St. Lawrence. They were very picturesque, tho' not quite so striking perhaps as I had expected them to be. We shall be in this neighborhood for several days, &amp; shall go hence to Lookport &amp; thence to Buffalo &amp; Niagara. I have just requested Col. Jewett, who is writing home, to have my letters forwarded to Buffalo, so that I shall not hear from you, dearest, for ten days perhaps. This is very tantalizing. I have been with two wedding parties on my tour, one on the stage between New Market &amp; Strasburg—where the bride appeared quite overcome at leaving her home. Another today on the cars-viz a lovesick couple, whose billing and cooing were sufficiently amusing. Our party consists of 7 besides the Colonel, 6 Southerners &amp; 1 Yankee. There are, Harrison of Missouri, McReady of South Carolina &amp; White of N.Y. all sent by Prof. Agassiz. Prof. O'Leary from the Catholic's College at Emmitsburg Md. Hollowell of Alabama Venable &amp; myself. We make a great picture, in our shirtsleeves, with our big hammers, striding through these Yankee towns—the people staring at us &amp; wondering what we find in the stones, which we so assiduously pound. It is rare that one of us has a clean shirt for half a day. I find however, that I care very little, since I am unknown. We have been cajoling the apothecaries &amp; barkeepers, sometimes with difficulty, out of brandy &amp; gin, of which we carry several flasks with us. I wish, my dear, you would say to my father that I have hardly time to write to you, or I would with pleasure reply to his last letter. I may get a chance however to drop him a line or two. Thank him for his kind offer of money &amp; tell him the object of my visit North-which I thought I had done myself long ago. Don't forget your husband, Mary, in your prayers. Believe that he thinks of you, &amp; loves to do so, longing for the time which shall restore him to you. I prize your love far beyond any earthly possession. Write to me, my dear, if there is anything which you want that I can get for you here-or for Eliza. Kiss her for me. Your devoted husband F. H. Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Richmond,VaJul20 3 paid Prof. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Va.Private Richmond July 20th 1855 My dear friend I was unfortunate in not seeing you at the University on the 29th when I was there for space. perhaps, of an hour. I did not arrive in time to do more than witness the delivery of the Masters' Diplomas, the last act in the ceremony of the Public Day, and after the crowd dispersed, my attention was called in the direction of one or two ladies of my acquaintance, with whom I was left alone by the unforeseen and provoking departure of their proper escorts. A haok was on the way to Charlottesville at the time of my release, and I was compelled to take the chance of getting there otherwise than on foot. The Alumni dinner took up the rest of the day, and on the next I left for Staunton, to meet a positive engagement. It was my purpose to have called on Prof. Smith, as well as on other Profs, but I was prevented, as you see, by want of time. However, I heard more from others about you, than I would have heard from yourself, and therefore I don't regret missing you so much, pleasant as you are to look upon. It is well that men should know how they stand in the esteem of their race, and on this account I take the liberty of saying between you and me that you stand a very fair chance of being damned (to use a saying of Buckingham's) since he is accursed of whom all men speak well. There was an universal sentiment in your favor, going to make you out a great man, and I would have been disposed to rate you one, had I not enjoyed better opportunities than any of my informants of knowing the opposite. As however the world is on one side and I on the other, numbers will doubtless carry the day, and you be decided as indeed a great man! I will enter a minority protest to any such verdict, placing my judgment above that of all the rest of mankind combined: unless you occupy the same ground with me. What a "jog-trot" gait is mine, by the way. You have gone up like a rocket and not come down like a stick, while I have spent my time in fixing and getting ready to go up, without rising in the slightest. The worst of the matter is, that now and then a random desire takes possession of me, which it is utterly impossible to carry out. My practice draws its slow length along so slowly, that all my matrimonial aspirations are actually nipped in the bud. What am I to do about this? The "gal" is poor,- I am poor,- therefore etc. I don't believe all creation could starve me from practising law, if I remained single, but the question is just narrowed down to this: Shall I sacrifice my profession for a wife? What is your opinion about it? You see, I can make a living—at least I think so, but am not even certain of that—at teaching, or on a tight, very tight, pinoh, at editing; but at law a poor wife operates as an estoppal. You were surprised before, and upon hearing this, will be more surprised than you were at first, at my throwing up the place at Concord, but I would not have been satisfied there as a subordinate, treated badly by the boys, and my sister will no longer be an obstacle to my removal from Richmond, as was the case last winter. If I could get a nice Professorship, I would be very glad to take it with a wife in the bargain: and as you intimated during our correspondence last winter, I want you to have a look-out for one for me. Now, in conclusion, let me beg you to keep all this communication strictly confidential, as I know you will do. Furthermore, write me about yourself, since I have written so much about myself. Yours sincerely James Pleasants</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harrisonburg July 25th 1855 My dear Mother I was glad to receive your kind letter &amp; to hear of your pleasant ride &amp; safe arrival home. Miss Taliaferro was unexpectedly sent for by her friends &amp; went to Staunton without coming through Harrisonburg &amp; I will stay with Grandma until Tuesday of next week. I will try to meet the cars so that I may get home the same day; but if I fail in doing so, will not get there 'till Wednesday. I therefore fear very much that I will not see you then, for I am sure you will be at Mr. Rives' before that. I was very sorry that I forgot to ask you to return my thanks to Sophia Bledsoe for the nice present she sent me. If you have an opportunity please do it now although its rather late. I send enclosed a letter from grandpa Tucker which arrived Monday evening. I hope you will excuse the liberty I took of opening it, as I could send it so much more conveniently this way. A letter also came to you from Charlie, but as I suppose there is nothing of great importance in it will keep it 'till I go. Grandma, I think, is pretty much the same, although complaining a great deal. She taxes her strength by walking about: Aunt Baxter spent part of the day here yesterday &amp; is also looking quite feeble. She expressed much regret b ecause of n ot being able to see more of you during your visit. Aunt Margaret leaves this evening for Philadelphia, but seems to go with many misgivings about leaving Willie. The rest of the family is pretty much as you left them. I am much obliged to Pa for cutting Eliza's gums, for it gave her almost immediate relief. With much love to you all in which the family unite I am Your affectionate daughter Mary Stuart Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Sherwood July 25th '55 Dear Eliza, Edward forgot your note to me the other day, but brought a message that you did not wish to be sent for until Monday next. Burwell will got to the U.y in time enough for you to reach here to dinner unless you prefer coming in the afternoon. I am glad you left Mrs. Harrison so much better than you had any reason to expect and hope she may yet be spared some time to her family. I got a letter from Papa yesterday. He said they took into consideration my invitation but were deterred from accepting it by tow considerations, the warmth of the summer here, which he has such a dread of, and a wish to confer with a publisher in regard to the 1st Vol. at least of his history, which he wishes to come out this fall. Mama had been much improved by the use of the water both in health and her eyes and could now eat almost abything with impunity. Happy condition for her. They were to leave for Philadelphia this week, and would most probably go to Long Branch. I hope Mary Smith has found the Rawley water of benefit to her eyes. I am glad she has had two such agreeable companions. Mr. R. &amp; myself went up last week to see sister Paulina. She is very much reduced, and still suffers a great deal, but I hope is better &amp; that she will slowly recover—her face is still somewhat distorted but her articulation is more distinct and she has again the use of her hand which was paralyzed. Poor Lucy looks still more delicate than she did last fall, and has had repeated hemorrhages sonce one inthe carriage just before she reached Alta Vista. It is astonishing though how cheerful she is notwithstanding. Though she frequently speaks as if she was quite aware of her danger. They all spoke affectionately of you and begged that while you were here, we would come up to see them. Margaret has a fine boy, much more like Capt. Bell than herself. Capt. Bell is now there and will probably stay some time. he expects to be ordered out to sea this fall. E. Douglas has also a very fine daughter, I can not say as usual sweet little girl she is so large, and she is too small to judge of her beauty. She seemed to have a very good nurse a Miss Pearly of Charlottesville. I was not able to send Betsey as I wished to do having so much company &amp; Julia being unable to cook—but she will now in a day or two. I promised E. when you came out that we would spend a day with her, she begged that we would come soon. We will go at the same time to see Mrs. Smith as Mary will by that time be there. I felt quite sorry to part with Belle &amp; L—- They were both I think much charmed with their visit to Albemarle and no part of it more than the portion spent at the U.y. Lucy said she felt as much at home with you as me. George has been very industrious. I am writing before breakfast &amp; he has been here some time having walked from Mr. Smith's. Edward &amp; Willie have risen early and gone out to shoot some squirrels to make a Brunswick stew for Mr. Rives, it is said to be very fine. Ned speaks of going to study with S. Smith. All here join in much love to you all. I hope Dr. H. intends to come out with you. You will have a plenty of room in the carriage for him. Your aff. sister Maria</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philadelphia, July 27th, 1855 My dear Eliza, We reached this place on Thursday to dinner, &amp; regretted that we could not stop to see you—&amp; uncertain whether you had not already gone to Sherwood. I was the more anxious to see you after hearing from young Stephens, who lives in Alexandria, that Mary's eyes were no better. The Rockbridge Alum Springs have proved efficacious in so many affections of the eyes that I most strongly recommend Mary to make a trial of them. We met, the day after we arrived, Wm. Stephens &amp; his wife, who had come on to consult Dr. Norris. They returned our visit last evening, &amp; I learnt from them that they had seen Norris, who advised Mrs. S. to go at once to some of the Virginia Springs. He seemed to prefer the White Sulphur. He would not give any opinion of the character of the disease, but I should suppose it was scrofulous in its character, in which case the Alum Springs would be decisively preferable to nay other. Mrs. T's health has I think been greatly benefited by her trip—&amp; her eyesight is almost as good as ever. We are now boarding at Miss Plumstead's! but sleep at home. We set off for Newport to-morrowm but shall stop in New York all Tuesday. I wrote to you as soon as I arrived herem but in my hurry omitting to put a stamp on my letter, I presumed it would not be forwarded under the last postoffice law, &amp; therefore now write you again, &amp; address you at Sherwood. Your mother sends you her love, &amp; joins me in remembrances to Maria, Mr. Rives, Dr. Harrison &amp; all your children. Tell Maria I shall write her after I reach Newport. I am your ever affectionate father George Tucker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paid 3 University of va.Aug 3 Prof. F. H. Smith Care of Col. JewettUtica New York University of Virginia Aug. 1st '55 My own precious husband I know you will forgive me for disregarding your earnest request that I would not write to you myself just for this one time. I assure you I will be doubly careful in other respects not to use my eyes too freely, and really this morning I have felt as if I must write to you with my own hands to thank you for the dear kind letters you have sent me during your absence. It seems to me that all I say is so cold and indifferent through another person and cam afford you but little satisfaction when it reaches you, except by informing you merely that we are all safe. Instead of returning home with pa I concluded to remain a week or ten days with Grandma, and so did not get home until this morning, unattended by any one but Elizabeth &amp; the baby. Indeed I could not have come well with pa, as they hired a hack which was heavily loaded as it was. With my usual thoughtlessness I did not think until a few days since that you would expect me to be at home, and therefore suffered a good deal from disappointment as day by day the stages would come in and bring no letter for me. I could not help sometimes fearing something had happened to you, and could only quiet myself by banishing the idea and reflecting that God was as near to protect you afar off, as when we were side by side, and that he would surely restore you to me in his own good time. I cannot tell you how much I long to have you with me again, but you must not think from that, that I am dissatisfied and unhappy. On the contrary I have been generally blesses with some degree of cheerfulness ever since we parted. I try to think always of the few short weeks to elapse before your return, and it is a source of continual gratification to me to remember that your wishes for a tour of the kind are at last fulfilled. Still I count the days and weeks as I never do when you are with me, and Oh! will it not be happiness to us both to meet again? I did not forget our wedding day, but thought of you and prayed for you with feelings of peculiar affection at that time. In reviewing our married life I see much to mourn over and regret in my conduct, and as you express somewhat the same feelings, it cannot be a very wrong conclusion to arrive at that we have both erred. However that may be, one thing I am sure of, that our love has a fine foundation in the very depths of both our hearts, which nothing I am convinced can ever shake, however the imperfections of our nature may sometimes produce coldness and even apparent unkindness of feeling. God strengthen and help us both to perform our duties to one another by the aid of his spirit through whom alone we can do anything aright! Eliza has not forgotten you. Yesterday I asked her whom she was going home to see, and getting no immediate reply I commenced, Charley, Jack, and before I could go on she said with her sweet little voice "papa". I suppose she missed you and thought you must be at home. I had to get her some powders and get Dr. Gordon to cut her gums in Harrisonburg and now she is looking much better, I think, although still more peevish &amp; self willed than formerly. Elizabeth however has been sick almost constantly since you left, and now has the asthma very badly. Indeed she can lift Eliza no better if as well as I can, and if she does not improve I hardly know what we can do. Your father very kindly promised to send for me as soon as I got here, so that the carriage may come any day. Lucy very kindlt offered before I proposed it to go with me instead of Elizabeth, who might stay at home and try to recruit. If I can get them a message I shall ask them not to send for me until the middle or last of next week, and one plan which has occurred to me is to stay out at Morven until you get home. I am almost sure that you would wish to pay them a visit of a few days at least on your return, and I cannot bear the idea of your going away from me again even for a day, and if I get home once more I suppose it would be impossible for me to ride that distance again. They would certainly send for you as soon as you get to Charlottesville, but perhaps you would be too tired to go out and it may not suit you otherwise. Whatever you wish I am perfectly ready to do, I just thought I would ask your opinion of that plan, devised probably by my own selfishness. Try to see Mr. Hunt in your travels and give him my love. Remember me to Mr. Venable too, I am very glad you have his companionship. It pained me, my dearest, to hear in your last letter that you were sick. I trust you are entirely recovered by this time. It makes me anxious however to hear from you again. Would you believe it! After just gotting 4 letters at once I was so unconscionable as to hope for one today, it seems as if I scarcely deserved what I have, to wish for more in half a day. It puts me in mind of Eliza's perpetual "mo" "mo" at Rawley. I do not know whether you will be inclined to laugh or scold when I tell you that I have opened another of Mr. Pleasant's confidential letters, dated July 20th. I did it this time too in perfect innocence, although he had taken the precaution to write "Private" distinctly on the back. Being rather anuunusual thing to proclaim that a letter contains secrets on the outside, and having besides no postage stamp, with my usual heedlessness I hastily concluded that it had not come by mail but by private opportunity, overlooking entirely the postmark "Richmond". A curious missive it is too. The sum of it is that he was at the University the 29th and had no time to come to see you. He asks your advice whether he shall give up his favourite profession &amp; marry a lady whom he loves although poor. In short he wishes you again to look out for a professorship for him, as his sister no longer needs him in Richmond. He says a subordinate position such as at Mr. Coleman's would not suit him. I found among the papers, cards to Mary Fleming's marriage to Mr. Schooler, which is to take place the 8th of this month. When Eliza is in a good humour she hugs &amp; kisses me for papa, and is sweeter than ever. When I got home it looked so desolate without you I could scarcely help crying, but then the letters cheered me almost immediately. Pa even is not at home. God bless and keep my beloved husband. Ever your devoted wife Mary Mrs. Col. Watson is very ill, expected to die. The fat Mr. Keblinger too was carried off last week by typhoid fever. I have sent 3 letters to Utica besides this, but to no one's care.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Utica N.Y.Aug 3 Mrs. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Utica Aug 3d 1855 My dearest wife We left New York yesterday morning &amp; came to Avon Springs (a sulphur spring like our White Sulphur) where we found quite a lively village. We did not however turn aside from our regular employment for amusement, but having dispatched our geological business, we started in an evening train for Rochester. Owing to an accident to a freight train upon the road, we had to go so slowly as to cause us to miss the cars for Utica. We were consequently compelled to spedn a dull evening in a noisy hotel &amp; then ride from 12½ to 5 o'clock in the morning. My anxiety to get to Utica was acused by my desire to hear from you. At the Avon Sp.s I had telegraphed to Buffalo to have my letterd sent to Utica if any should arrive there. I was at first grievously disappointed this morning when the postmaster told me there was nothing for me. I began to think that something of a serious nature must have occurred to prevent your writing. Happening to ask the attendant whether the letters he had examined were all that had been received for t three weeks, he referred me to an advertized list, where to my joy I found 3 recorded for me. These I immediately claimed &amp; devoured with avidity. I have not time before the closing of the mail to tell you all the thoughts suggested by the perusal of them. I am glad to learn that you are well &amp; hopeful, &amp; that Eliza is improving, but extremely sorry that your eye sight has not been materially benefitted. I shall endeavor to get the opinion &amp; advice of some experienced oculist in ref. to your case before I get home. I learn with regret, from Mrs. Broadis' kind letterm that it is sickly in Charlottesville. If so be sure to stay as much as possible in the country, (if circumstances admit of your leaving home). You must thank Mrs. B. for her letter &amp; ask her to write again. She is so particular in her information, that her letters are exceedingly satisfactory. After all, what I have read seems to come through a third uninterested party, and does not bring that feeling of responding affection-of cordial sympathy, which arises in my bosom when I read my dear Mary's own words. But don't try your eyes to give me such pleasure, which is unnecessary, though so dear. What is essential to know is that you are well and happy. We are to go tomorrow to Trenton Falls, where we shall probably re main over Sunday. On Monday to Scholaric, where we expect to find Professors Agassiz &amp; Hall. Two or three days there will terminate our tour. Farewell my darling. Remember your husband. You are his dearest, most prized possession. May God bless you! My love to all our family &amp; relatives. Yours most truly F. H. S.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Union, Aug. 6th, 1855 My dear Mrs. Harrison, I cannot thank you enough for your very agreeable letter, &amp; I assure you it would (have) been answered long ago, but I have had innumerable interruptions. Aunt Adeline &amp; I have been here for nearly a week, spending our time very delightfully with Mr. Andrew Beirne, &amp; his two little daughters. We expected to see Cousin Ellen Gordon &amp; her husband, from Huntsville, but were greatly disappointed to find, they left the day before our arrival. Cousin Margaret is rapidly improving—indeed the Doctor hopes the Red Sweet has almost cured her. We all leave next tuesday for Lexington, where we will spend a week at Col. Reed's, &amp; then go home. I am really glad. I begin to feel a little tired of the mountains &amp; then too I want to see all my University friends so much. It has been raining successively for three, or four days, &amp; it makes me feel right gloomy. This is not the gayest, or most brilliant town in the world under any circumstances, but in bad weather it's enough to break anybody's heart. We are going to the Salt Sulphur this evening, only two miles from here. There was a large fancy ball at the Sweet Springs several nights' ago—some of the dresses were beautiful, &amp; some perfectly ridiculous. I wont attempt to describe anything until I see you. I believe all the watering places in the mountains are filled to overflowing. The fatal fever has driven large numbers from Norfolk &amp; Portsmouth &amp; it is really sad to see so many grave faces among us. I wish very much you had been with us this summer, our time has been so delightfully spent. I wish too you could have seen old Mrs. Kelly at the Red Sweet. She is so curious. A few nights before I left there, everybody was in a whirl of excitement, preparing for tableaux. Old Mrs. K. was asked to represent Queen Elizabeth, she consented reluctantly, &amp; like a spoilt child pouted, &amp; said she"Would prefer being Mary Queen of Scots, as I think, without my cap, there is a likeness." I wonder if she really thought so? "Oh! vanity of vanities, all is vanity". Her grand-daughter, Miss Watson was dressed up in the most unbecoming, fantastic style, &amp; made to dance every night—her steps were entirely in keeping with her appearance. Please dont mention this to any of the Presbyterians, particularly Mr. Dinwiddie, if you do a conspiracy will immediately be formed against me. I left Dr. &amp; Mrs. Davis at the Red Sweet, they have both improved wonderfully. I laugh and tell Dr. D. if he has any feeling he will prepare his mother for the shock. You know she said "if Stage gets fat, I shall be so mortified". I am glad Mr. Smith has had such a pleasant trip, I hope he came back with renewed strength. Sophie Bledsoe writes to me every now, &amp; then, but I'm not so "well posted up with University news" as you supposed I would be. I shall feel highly honoured to receive another of your charming letters, still I feel some delicacy in pressing you to write, knowing how much you have to do. If you can find time I shall be greatly obliged &amp; delighted. Direct to Lexington, Va. Care of Col. Reed. I wish I had something entertaining to tell you, but in a little town like this, news is a scarce commodity. Cousin Margaret, the Dr., &amp; Mrs. Alexander all desired to be affectionately remembered to you. Aunt Adeline unites with me in warmest love to you, &amp; all our kind friends around you. Remember me most particularly to dear Mary, &amp; also to Mr. Smith. Your sincerely attached friend (over) L. W. Downing P. S. Aunt A. begs you will say to Mrs. John Minor, with her best love, that she is hourly reminded of her by the shoe-bag— it has been the most useful thing she has. I forgot to say the tableaux were abandoned, greatly to Mrs. Kelly's regret. (Lucy Wilson Downing (Mrs. E. B. Smith) to Mrs. Gessner Harrison)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Albany N.Y.Aug 10 Mrs. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Va. Albany Aug. 9th 1855 My dearest Mary I left Utica on Tuesday morning without receiving a letter from you. I have now heard nothing from you since your return to the Univ.y. Indeed I do not know that you have gotten any letter I have written you since I came North. I am exceedingly anxious to learn how you are, and if not letter comes, shall feel like cutting short my stay here. We went on Monday (two of us) in company with Dr. Copeman of Utica ro Canastola to see the great Mr. Spencer, the maker of microscopes. We found him very affable &amp; kind. I think I shall try one of his instruments if you will allow me to spend so much money. On Monday afternoon, I packed &amp; forwarded a large box of specimens to the University. If it is sent to our house as it doubtless will be, please allow no one to open or disturb it but have it put in a safe place, where it will be kept dry. Ruesday we left Utica for Scholaric where we arrived by stage at sundown. Scholaric valley is the most beautiful I ever beheld. I cannot imagine a more delightful spot in which to spend a few weeks. It is secluded comparatively, by not being intersected by any railroad. We may see &amp; enjoy it together some of these days. We remained there geologising until yesterday. Professor James Hall of Albany joined us day before yesterday, &amp; has been a most agreeable addition to our party. Yesterday at noon, after much shaking of hands &amp; expression of good wishes, our party broke up Some of us coming to Albany &amp; a few staying a day or two longer with Col. Jewett. MacReady &amp; myself stopped here over night, in order to accept Mr. Hall's invitation to visit his private collection of geolog.l specimens this morning. I shall remain here today &amp; go to New York tomorrow in the steamboat. On Monday I propose to go to Middletown, Conn, in order to examine what is called "the new old sandstone" in which I expect to be assisted by Prof. Johnson. On Wednesday I desire to get to Providence R.I. where the Scientific Assoc.n begins its meeting on that day. I do not know how long I shall wish to stop there. If I get no letter from you, I must vut my visit short, for I cannot endure the suspence, especially as your health was precarious when I left. It requires 2 or 3 days for a letter to come from the Univ. to this region. You can therefore calculate where to direct it. My health is quite good, notwithstanding my dissipation in cigars, for which you will scold me. Accept. my dearest wife, my warmest love, &amp; the assurance that I prize more &amp; more the treasure of your affection. I pray God to bless you in soul &amp; body, &amp; to sustain you in the hour of your necessity. Believe that your husband fondly preserves your image in his heart &amp; that his last thought at night is of his dear Mary. Most affectionately yours Francis H. Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">New York City Aug. 11th 1855 My dearest Mary I promised in my note of this afternoon that I would write to you tonight. I find myself so tired however &amp; have so many things to talk about that I will beg your indulgence until tomorrow, when I trust it will be no sin to finish that I now commence. I wish my darling little wife now away in Virginia a happy &amp; refreshing slumber regretting much that I must wait yet a few days before I can lay my head in her dear bosom-my sweetest home. Good night! God bless you! Sunday night. I resume with gladness, my love, the work I began last night. And first I must tell you, as I have been accustomed to do, what have been my wanderings since last I wrote. On Thursday we left as I think I told you, the Schoharic Valley and came to Albany where we stopped at a very excellent house "Congress Hall" Friday morning Mr. Macready &amp; myself walked out to the residence of Prof. Hall, who received us very kindly. We spent the morning, looking over his vast collection of fossils. We took wine with him. After dinner we called again upon him, and when I was about leaving, he took me over to his dwelling, some distance from his museum, to introduce me to Mrs. Hall, so that, as he said, I might hereafter feel free to call and stay at his house, whether he was at home or not. I was very much pleased with this visit. I took the steamboat that night and came to New York City. I have rooms at the Astor House. Yesterday, a most pleasant day, I spent very agreeably at the Astor &amp; Mercantile Libraries, &amp; at the Book &amp; Instrument stores I see vast quantities of books which I want, but have not means to buy &amp; so must practise self denial. It was while at Western Arms that your letter was handed to me, having arrived while I was standing ing in the store. I was overjoyed at seeing My Mary's handwriting-was glad to learn the improvement in your eyesight, only to ge made sorry that to contribute to my gratifica.n you had injured them again. If you write at all, my dear, don't write more than a few lines. I will suggest a plan, which will combine all possible advantages. Let Summerfield or Mr. Broadus or any one who will, write in his or her own name, all matters of news or of general interest and then you, if you can without agony, put in a few words of love I don't like any one's writing for you. They tell no more than if writing themselves &amp; it seems cold as coming from you. Let the letters be directed to the "Astor House" New York. I saw Dr. Schele yesterday but did not get a chance of speaking to him. I have been approached by two old students since I arrived, Mr. Maury &amp; Mr. Hall of Norfolk. The latter was scared away by the yellow fever. I was much amused yesterday by seeing an announcement in immense capitals hung against Barnum's museum, that there could be seen at all hours, our old friend "the Swiss bearded lady, and her son the infant Esau." Esau is represented as a tall boy with a smock frock &amp; an immense beard. I presume he is quite a rival of his famous namesake, though I have not been to see him. Today I have been at church twice—in the morning at the old John St. Church, where we worshipped once, when in New York, as you will recollect, &amp; in the afternoon at Trinity Church. I desired very much to go to hear Dr. Alexander but did not think of it in time. This is a most pleasant time to visit New York. It is so remarkably cool, that one can walk in the sun even for a long time, without being oppressed. I desire to leave in the morning for Middletown, where I hope to have a pleasant time. I have not seen Albert Hunt yet, &amp; know not where he is. In reference to those books, do, my love, as you choose. Lend what you please to careful persons, merely taking a note of it to prevent forgetfulness. Enjoin upon Summerfield not to soil your Waverley-as we value them so much. I hope my little daughter does not disturb her dear mama. Tell her, that her papa does not like that, but kiss her nevertheless for him. Providence favoring, I shall be at home next week, and I assure you I shall not want to make any more long excursions without your company, for a long time. With many prayers for your happiness, I remain in unabated affection, your devoted husband, F. H. Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Providence R.I.Aug 16 Mrs. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Va. Providence Aug 16th 1855 My dearly beloved wife I left New York city on Monday morning for Middletown, where I arrived about 2 o'clock the same day. Every thing appeared, quite familiar to me, the same buildings with few exceptions, the same old walks &amp; many well remembered faces. The first person whom I want to see after taking rooms at the Hotel, was Mr. Thompson. He appeared delighted to see me again &amp; pressed me to take tea at his house that evening, which it gave me pleasure to do. In the afternoon I called on my old Professor Johnston. I found only his wife at home &amp; was most cordially welcomed. I saw the Professor afterward in the College building, &amp; had a long talk about old times. I found that he was to start the next day for Providence and I concluded to go with him, as I expected to have his assistance, when I planned to stay in Middletown for the purpose of geologising-and his purpose to leave so soon would have deprived me of a good part of the benefit I expected to derive from my visit. In the evening I took tea at Mrs. Thompson's, my old landlady, and I am sure I never had a heartier greeting, than I received from her. She inquired particularly about you, and indeed every one expressed a kind wish, that I had brought you with me. I am sure that their kind feelings towards me would have been equally extended to my dear little wife. Van Vleck and his wife had been boarding with them for 18 months but had left a few days before to visit his father in New York. I was sorry that I could not see them. Hunt had also left. The next morning I took breakfast with Prof. &amp; Mrs. Johnston, and met my old friend, Miss Josephine Holdich, whom I was rather surprised to find yet unmarried. I called afterwards on Prof. Lindsay and upon Mrs. Holdich who is spending the summer in Middletown. Mrs. Thompson seemed so anxious to have my danguerreotype, that I had one taken for her. At 11 o'clock I started with Prof J. for this place. We got here at 4 o'clock day before yesterday. I took lodgings at the City Hotel. I went into the dining room to get a late dinner, &amp; found but one man there, an old gentleman, who very politely invited addressed me, &amp; entered into conversation with me. In the course of it, he remarked he was from Philadelphia. I told him I had observed the name of Dr. Dunglison of Philadelphia upon the register, and that I was desirous of seeing him. Said he, "that is my name". I gave him my own, and we had of course a very warm shake of hands. He told me that your Grandpa &amp; gr.dma were at New Port, and as it is but a short ride from here, I shall go down to see them some evening. The Dr. very politely introduced me to several gentlemen of eminence, among them, to Prof. Mahan of West Point. We walked about the City together during the evening. The next day, the associa.n met in the chapel of Brown University in this city. Just before opening, Mr. Rogers appeared in the room, and I was very happy to grasp his hand again. Mrs. Rogers is with him. We had a very interesting meeting yesterday. Mr. Rogers made a handsome impromptu speech. It brought back old times vividly to my recollection. He has not changed a particle, it appears to me. Yesterday evening, I took tea at Prof. Coawell's. He is a warm hearted man, &amp; recollects with great pleasure a visit he made to the University 30 years ago, at which time he dined with Mr. Jefferson. His daughter &amp; his future son-in-law (a professor here) were exceedingly agreeable. The latter also visited Virginia a few years ago, &amp; fell into the hands of Billy Gilmer, of whose jokes &amp; squibs he preserves a merry recollection. I went with Prof.Caswell at 9 o'clock to a reception at President Waylands, where the whole association were met. Dr. W. was glad, he said, to see anyone from the University-&amp; requested me to present his respects to Dr. McGuffey particularly. Will you do it for me? I met Mrs. Rogers there. We had a long talk. She wants to visit Virginia-says she prefers our society to that at Boston, which she found unpleasantly stiff, cold &amp; ram-roddish after leaving Virginia. She looks a little older than she used to do. Mr. Rogers intends paying us a visit in October. I met Van Vleck here. I have been fortunate in becoming acquainted through my various friends, with the most distinguished scientific men of the country. Nothing could exceed the cordiality with which I was received by Prof. Agassiz, to whom I was introduced this morning by Prof. Hall. Mr. Pierce also was very polite. In addition to these I have become acquainted with Prof. Henry, Dr. Gould, Prof. Loomis, Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Bache. The latter told me I looked very much like his dear friend Mr. Courtenay when he was of my age. In all this politeness I observe an evident respect for the University of Virginia—whose high position is beginning to be recognised by intelligent men everywhere. How happy would I be if I could aspire to add anything to an institution which I have so much reason to love. I will write again soon. Till then farewell. God bless my dear wife &amp; daughter! With sincere affection, your attached husband F. H. Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paid 3 Tye River Warehouse Va.Sep 5 Mrs. Eliza L. C. Harrison Care of Dr. Gesner HarrisonUniversity of Virginia Inglewood September 3d 1855 My dear Eliza Your very kind &amp; affectionate letter arrived when I was confined to my bed from an accident to my foot which ran some risk of proving a dangerous one. All danger was averted by care and attention though I had a tedious confinement of about 5 weeks. I do not exaggerate, nay I fall short of the truth; when I say your letter was a real solace to me-the tender ties of our early happy days seem to cast a radiance over the present &amp; future as well as the past. How vividly did the past rise up before me with all its joys &amp; sorrow. Your first great grief, my dear Eliza is the death of your Mother. What a black day it was to me-how desolate miserable I was. I was so young in sorrow that I did not even know my proper place was by your side. Mr. Read gave us a holyday; and oh what a sorrowful time it was-it was the first cloud on my horizon, as well as yours, &amp; even now it looms forth among other griefs with such distinctness. You really are so young &amp; bright that I am tempted to forget the 25 years that have passed since your marriage and believe you ot be the same Eliza who shared with me dear Otwayanna's ridicule as being "pleased with a feather &amp; tickled with a straw". Your promise to visit me in October gives me great pleasure. I hope you will not allow yourself to be deterred from a faithful performance. I have for you &amp; Maria violated the laws of my country, Maine liquor laws and all &amp; surreptiously obtained spirit &amp; made a huge jar of brandy peaches for your delectation. Will not say there may not be a little of the old time cordial of Perfect Love brewing for you besides the intangible portion in my heart. Lucy I think had rather an ambition to write to Mrs. Harrison for me again &amp; rather hesitated hinted as much to me but I felt a kind of jealously of any ones answering your letter but my own self. I was constantly expecting to be about in a few days; and the Dr. assured me I would be &amp; reserved the privilege until I recovered. I see George has accepted a situation in Charlottesville. I congratulate you on having him so near you. I think you an enviable woman with 6 fine boys. My dear only son is a constant sour source of solicitude-he is so far from me &amp; his constitution is very feeble. He fell off 10 lb the week before he left me &amp; whom one has just flesh enough to cover their bones 10 pounds is a serious loss. He met with a great affliction when he was at home in the death of a young friend &amp; this affected his health &amp; spirits very much- he left home exceedingly depressed so as to give me the greatest anxiety. I hope from the tone of his letters that his spirits have revived. I think I mentioned to you his being warmly attached to two youths members of the Baptist Church one of them a boy of great amiability &amp; intelligence &amp; of a most angelic temper was taken with typhoid fever and died about 10 days before Patrick went to college. He is better satisfied from home this year &amp; more &amp; more pleased with Emory &amp; Henry. They have accomodations for 250 young men. The country is a very abundant &amp; health one. The professors very able and very kind so that Patrick has only to regret his separation from friends &amp; home. I have been having quite a lonely time this summer. Anna &amp; Henry feel very much wronged not to have one of the girls with them constantly. I never have more than two &amp; frequently only one member of my family besides Mr. Cabell. If I had six great fine boys like you I would not have time to be lonesome. My sister as well as Anna are always ready to rob me of the girls; so that when I keep them at home it is with great difficulty. I hope Mrs. Smith found her summer excursion beneficial to her eyes. We have a very interesting young lady in our nrighborhood a member of your church Miss Matilda Smiley who says she is a acquaintance of both of your daughters &amp; expressed a great desire to visit yo when you come to see me. She is our young &amp; lovely poetess "Matilda" but I greatly fear that we shall not long have the privilege of her society on earth; she has just lost a favorite brother &amp; nephew and her affliction has greatly impaired her health. She has once before had a hemorhage from her lungs &amp; her disease has returned on her with great violence &amp; ther is scarcely a possibility of her restoration. My sisters unite with me in anticipating a great deal of enjoyment in seeing you. Margaret has the most vivid recollections connected with you &amp; your family &amp; wishes me to give her timely notice so as to get to see you as soon as possible. I am afraid from the time you named `October' that I shall not have the pleasure of seeing Dr. Harrison with you. It would be a great gratification to me to see him here &amp; I shall not dispair of his coming at some future time. I suppose you heard cousin Polly through the death of an uncle had had a large accession to her fortune and could afford to lose an "interminable series" of rich dark green barege veils. I have not seen her since my return home. I dare say we are two jolly s we shall meet about the time of Willies marriage. I hope you are going to bring Rosalie. Speaking of cousin Polly reminds me of her quixotic excursion in behalf of cousin Pollys veil. Do not my dear Eliza imitate my bad example &amp; make me wait so long to hear from you. Lucy criticised my excuse &amp; reminded me said I reminded her of Mr. Squeers who was so crippled in his legs that he could not hold a pen &amp; that she did not see what my foot had to do with my writing but I was alarmed at my symptoms &amp; out of spirits at the prospect of parting with Patrick for 10 months so that I did not have the heart to write. The girls nursed me so well &amp; arranged Patricks clothes &amp; kept house for me that I rather think I improved and feel strong er than when I saw you at the University. Give my most affectionate regard to Dr. Harrison. I have the most pleasant remembrances of his knidness &amp; hospitality although he was being pulled "seven ways for Sunday" &amp; one can scarcely understand how he found time to have a kind feeling for every body. I hope to see him "more quiet time". Remember me to your daughters &amp; sons Peachey &amp; Ned as well as George &amp; believe me dear Eliza Your very sincere friend M. A. C abell. Sally desires her love to you &amp; thanks for your kind mention of her. Lucy has been with Anna for the last 10 days.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Francis H. SmithUniversity of Virginia Utica Sep 5th 1855 My dearest Mary I am prompted to send you a line or two this evening. I have received no letter from you since those of which I have already told you. I wrote from Watertown July 22d requesting a cheque. It makes me somewhat anxious about it, that I have heard nothing of it; and if sent it may have been lost. We spent yesterday at Trenton Falls, 18 miles from this place. It is indeed a lovely spot, about which we will talk when I see you. Last night we attended a party at Col. Jewett's, where we met some of the most respectable society of the city. I did not make the acquaintance of any young lady, confining myself to the gentlemen &amp; the married ladies. Today, I went to Church with the Jewetts, who are exceedingly high in their Episcopal faith. This afternoon I have been dozing. We shall stay in this place until Tuesday. I hope to hear from you soon, my love. I have thought a good deal about our home affairs. It is well to go off from one's home occasionally, for then, I think, the circumstances of domestic life, like a landscape viewed from a distance, acquire their true proportions. Proximity often distorts small affairs into undue importance. I want to see Eliza so much. I hope she will not forget her pa. Kiss her for her dear little postscript. I trust to read still batter and longer letters from her, one of these days. I send you my warmest love, dearest. Remember me to all my friends &amp; especially to my father &amp; his family. Yours in fondest affection F. H. Smith</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harrisonburg Sept 5th 1855 My Dear Sister You must really excuse me for not answering your kind letter sooner, as my engagements have been more numerous than usual. Ma has had Clarissa hired out for several weeks. The consequence was we had the greater portion of the work to do. Suky could not get through with the cooking washing &amp; ironing for our family &amp; attend to her child, besides Ma permitted her to nurse Mrs. Martz babe several times a day. Her attention was so much divided you may know we got but little good of her. The Presbytery came off in the meantime &amp; we had company to entertain, so you may know I had but little time to write. Clarissa came home yesterday. I dont know which one Ma will hire out again. She has put Tom in the country too. it is said at a very good place. We miss him very much on some accounts, but it is better for him he had gotten to be such an unmanageable boy. Margaret &amp; William &amp; Lucy &amp; Sue Heneberger left last Wednesday for Burner Springs. We have heard once from them. They were pleased but could not tell then that they had derived any benefit Mitchell Conrad says Margaret ought by all means to have gone to the All-healing. He is just from there &amp; has great faith in its waters. She left Willie at home with Fannie. She is very well &amp; very contented. Fannie &amp; Mary Rush are busily engaged in making tops for gaiters. Mr. Way pays them fifty cents a pair. They can make two pair a day. I fear it is to confining for Mary. She has been more complaining lately, not deservedly. I think she has improved very much since she has been with us, both in spirits &amp; health. Minnie is well, but misses Lucy very much as we all do. I fear Mary will not make her visit much longer now that Lucy has left her. Caroline speaks of going with her when she goes. It is surprising how much Ma has improved this summer &amp; if she was in a situation she could feel she was not obliged to expose herself to the damp &amp; cold, I think she would be in very comfortable health. She has been suffering very much from a swelling in her feet &amp; legs. There was quite a full attendance of ministers at the Presbytery &amp; quite a number of strangers, every thing past of pleasantly &amp; agreeably. Mr. Bocock was installed. The Church is quite pretty since it has been firnished. They had no accessions to the Church but Bob Hardesty. They consider him quite a gain hoping I presume to get his father &amp; mother. Mr. Bocock has been lamenting the tendency to a sectarian spirit that he thought was manifested here &amp; wished some effort made to put it down. To show what he is doing, I will tell you one instance. The trustees of the seminary had elected Mr. McGruder a new school Presbyterian to teach the next session, but instead of encouraging his members to support that school, he has gotten 10 gentlemen to raise a salary of 500 dollars to employ a son of Dr. Whites to teach in town. It will of course break down the other school, for it is difficult to keep it up any way, &amp; it was all done secretly. They are now trying to get up a female school for a Lady of there Church. I have been preserving &amp; pickling but have not been able to get any Peaches yet. We got the first we have had yesterday but they were very indifferent. I fear I shall not get any fit to preserve. But for the kindness of some friends in the country we would not have tomatoes enough to eat. I have not put one up yet. We have fine corn but not much else in our garden. We continue to have a great deal of rain. it has been raining more or less for two days &amp; nights. some persons perdict a great deal of sickness, but I hope it will not be so, John Green Smith &amp; his Lady arrived from California last Saturday. I have not seen them yet. The report came here that he was unhappily married &amp; had become very dissapated. I hope it is not true. Ma received a letter from Maria some time since. I will answer it shortly. Our love to her if she has returned, also to Mary &amp; kisses to the children. Ma &amp; all join me in love to yourself, brother, Rosalie &amp; the boys. Your affectionate Sister, Mary J. Harrison</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs. Polly HarrisonHarrisonburg Rockingham Co., Va. Saturday aft. Mrs. Harrison, I will now endeavor to fulfill my long neglected promise to write you. I could not allow my silence to argue forgetfulness, for rest assured that your kindness to me will ever be remembered, the more because I was a stranger not only to yourself &amp; family, but to all by whom I am surrounded, &amp; being far from my home and friends I am doubly grateful for any kindness or attention shown me. I have delayed for no other reason than that of a lack of interesting or important items to communicate knowing that you hear often from Mrs. H and Fannie consequently I have waited from week to week in the vain hope of at last finding something to write about. We are all much pleased to have Mrs. Harrison &amp; the children with us again. Little Lucy is improving rapidly. I do think that she is a beautiful child and universally admired. Poor children! so soon deprived of a father's love &amp; care. May their Mother long be spared to them to teach &amp; instruct them in the great truths of Divine Word, to tell them of him, who blessed little children &amp; said "of such is the kingdom of God" &amp; may the God of the fatherless ever supply their every want and in blessing them here prepare them for the enjoyment of "Heaven's bliss". They are a source of the greatest comfort to their afflicted mother's widowed heart, &amp; I hope that God in mercy will spare them both to her many long years. I know too well the anguish that one feels in giving up near &amp; dear friends in the providence of God I am left an orphan sometimes I am tempted to murmur. I cannot see why it was necessary for me to be deprived of my father's care, my mother's boundless love &amp; tender anxiety &amp; left alone, then I pray for forgiveness &amp; for resignation &amp; for God's grace to prepare me to meet them in the mansions of the blest. There we'll never never part. It is a consoling thought that the seperation is short, the reunion eternal. You too have buried your loved ones, &amp; soon expect to meet them. I often feel as if I would like to be as near the grave as yourself, for aught I know I am, again I experience such a fear &amp; abhorrence of its gloom-its loneliness-life to me is sweet &amp; I cling to it with all the earnestness which ever characterizes hopeful youth—yet sometimes in the solitude &amp; quiet of night there comes over me a sense of its uncertainty, of the insufficiency of a worldly life to afford pleasure, then I resolve to consecrate my heart, life and abilities all to the cause of Christ. But with returning day returns sin, &amp; I yield to the temptation and daily offen my Saviour. Will you not remember me in your prayers? I do not ever expect to see you again. I return home in December. I may visit Virginia at some future time, yet I will ever remember my visit at your house, the hospitality &amp; cordiality with which you received me. Please give my love to Miss Mary &amp; Miss Carrie, Miss Stewart &amp; Mrs. Stevens. My respects to Mr. Williams. Yours in sincerity, A. Sherman</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Millington Va2 Sept Mrs. Mary HarrisonHarrisonburg Virginia University of Virginia Sep My dear Grandmother I must appear very negligent to you, after promising to write you an account of our journey home, to be silent so long. My only excuse is, that I have been just as busy as I possibly could be ever since our arrival, and although it is very true that I might at any time almost have written you a few lines, I did not feel as if I cared to send a letter unless I could have time to say every thing you would like to hear. We have been quite anxious to hear how you are. I do hope you have improved greatly since we left. To begin at the beginning, the morning we left Harrisonburg we had a very pleasant ride to Staunton, where we found Mr. Smith ready to receive us at the stage office. We stayed at the American Hotel where I was very much pleased, it seems to me a much better house than the Virginia. I found Mr. Smith looking considerably worse than when he was with us in Harrisonburg but it was rather the effects of his indisposition at the springs than any present complaint for he is on the whole quite well now. Tell Aunt Caroline he asked me directly where she was, and regretted with me that she did not come. We found all well at home except Ma's servants all of whom have been sick in turn I believe. Maria did not return home until yesterday and I found her compnay very pleasant although we had to keep Annie separate from Eliza. One reason I did not write to you immediately was that she begged me to let her take my place, and something prevented her accomplishing it, but she says she will certainly let you hear from her before long. Grandpa &amp; Grandma intend returning to Philadelphia in about ten days. George has not yet decided whether he will accompany them, but he seems disposed to do so. Yesterday they saw in the newspapers an account of old Dr. Patterson's death, which accounts for his son's not writing. He has been paralysed and perfectly helpless for a long time, which I suppose must reconcile his family somewhat to his death, as life could no longer be desirable to him. Last night Charles Wertenbaker and some other young men constructed a balloon of tissue paper, and you never saw anything ascend more beautifully than it did. It went up so high that it appeared like a distant star, and so far off that the most far sighted could not see it descend. I thought the boys certainly deserved great credit for their ingenuity. The idea was of ballooning was suggested by Mr. Elliott's ascension last week which was a very successful one, although he came down only 7 miles from here. I have just heard that Aunt Maria is at pa's, but have not seen her yet. Pa still speaks of visiting you again this vacation if he can raise the wherewithal, and he will be pretty sure to do that. Edward has not yet returned, but Ma expects him soon. You will wonder I daresay why I have been so busy, but it is easy to explain when I tell you that I found all the preserves I had made spoiling from not having been closed up, and I set to work immediately to make them over as well as some fresh. Lucy has not come back yet, and we have had some company every day since we have been at home, with an inexperienced young girl only for help. Yesterday Grandpa &amp; Grandma and Mr. &amp; Mrs. Bledsoe &amp; their daughter dined here, and I must say I gave them rather a poor dinner although I did the best I could under the circumstances. Mrs. Bledsoe talks in true Yankee style, but seems to be a well informed amiable woman. Miss Sophy Bledsoe is very pleasing in appearance, and I hope they will improve upon farther acquaintance. Mrs. McGuffey is suffering a good deal from a rising breast, and he baby is exceedingly delicate also, it will be wonderful if either of them live long. Mr. &amp; Mrs. Minor are still at the Springs. Dr. Cabell's family are also absent. Indeed the University looks almost as much (part of a letter from Mary Stuart Smith to her grandmother Mrs. Peachy Harrison.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Sept. 7th 1855 Dear Sis E. Though I am very busy this morning I will devote a few moments to you. Yours of 30th ult. came safe to hand and found us all in the enjoyment of usual health. E. Ridgely was very much pleased with her letter and will answer soon. The vacation being over, she returned to school last Monday. Doubtless you will be lonesome without your Sons and being in the Country you will be apt to become depressed and dispirited, but it is for their benefit and I rejoice with you, that they are already repaying their father and yourself for the care and pains you have so freely bestowed upon them. It would be a great comfort to me if we were situated so that we could see each other frequently, but I have learn ed long ago that we cannot have every thing in this world just as we want it. Yet I remember if we live right and are faithful to the grace given, we will meet again with our beloved ones where "all is calm and joy and peace" and where parting is no more. The health of our City is good. Through the mercy of the Lord we have thus far preserved from the Epidemic that has been desolating neighborin Cities. Their condition is distressing in the extreme. Ma &amp; the girls join me in love to you all. Write soon. I will try and do better next time. Yr aff. Sister Eliza P. Hamilton If Mr. Smith in visiting Loudon takes the district en route, can he not come over to B. if it is only for a few hours. We would be very glad to see him, and you also if you would only come.

She contemplates a short residence in your vicinity, while her son is being educated at your University. Doctor Habersham and myself will gratefully appreciate whatever civilities you may extend to her. I am anxious she should imbibe pleasant impressions of my native state, and in securing to her your acquaintanceship, and friendship, I could scarcely surround her with more pleasant influences, while you, I am sure, will admire, and appreciate the lovely attributes of mind, and heart, which adorn my new Cousin.

      <field name="fulltext">Edward T. Harrison Care Dr. G. HarrisonUniversity of Va. Petersburg Sept.r 27 1855 My dear Ned I should have written to you several weeks ago, but unavoidable circumstances have kept me from doing a great many things that I wanted very much to do. Many of our relations are here, and their being here requires all of my time in attending to them &amp; their wants. Father arrived here yesterday, and told me of the very pleasant day he spent with you all in Charlottesville. My only regret was that you did not come down with them, altho' I knew I was expecting an impossibility. Old Geo or yourself must come down Christmas &amp; spend "old Xmas" week with me at my Farm. We will have good times and will not disgrace the weak by refraining from mirth &amp; conviviality, but will have an anniversary of the week, as it used to be in "Old times", "Waveless wells of punch", "kind hearts", &amp; "lassies true", as Wilson says, we'll have. I am not joking, you must come down. Now one word, as a favor; Jimmy will soon be coming to yr. place. You do not know how wild he is. Living at a whorehouse is nothing—getting drunk is a small matter with him—running in debt to extremes, is a matter of no consequence. And I know exactly what his course is going to be at the University—&amp; if you do not exercise all of your self control, he might lead you astray, &amp; at the final you would feel rather "blankish". Jimmy will spree at the University, live at the whorehouse—go greatly in debt— be constantly visiting ladies—&amp; do no studying—for God's sake, &amp; for my own, Ned, do try and keep him from gambling, drinking etc. The wildest company, Jimmy will seek, &amp; he will be ruined before he knows it. I do not mind a young man's being wild in a moderate way, (as we used to be), for every boy must "sow his wild oats", a person may take a frolic now &amp; then &amp; may play at cards, without forming any seated bad habits, but when a person delights in dissapating all of the time, &amp; follows bad habits constantly, &amp; is unceasingly indulging in pursuits, degrading in themselves, then I fear for him. Now Jimmy seems to be perfectly reckless, as to any consequence &amp; does not seem to appreciate advice from me. But I think that you &amp; Geo c.d keep him straight. Such a letter as this, concerning my own brother, I w.d not write to any one but to yourself or Geo, &amp; feeling that, for any of yr brothers I w.d feel it a pleasure to do the same thing, if circumstances happened to require it, I know that you will not disregard what I say, or think it of no importance. Do not let any one but Geo see this letter, and do not let Jimmy know, that you know he is such a hell of a care. But keep him straight for my sake. You will have every opportunity of finding out whether he goes in debt, gambles or frolics, &amp; if he does correct him &amp; let me know it. If you were in my situation, with a wild bro away from you, you w.d feel as I do. Please send all of my things down immediately by Express. I shall expect them. Remember me to every body of my acquaintance up there, except Bledsoe or his family. I w.d not feed them, if they were starving, I do not think. Especially give my respects to Mrs. Smith &amp; her family. I shall never give up my idea of having yr. Father down here. Tell him he must come down &amp; look around, when I get fixed. Very sincerely yr friend Jos. Van Holt Nash</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Culpeper Sep 5th 1855 My dear Mother, As it has been more than a week now since we left home, I suppose you will feel some anxiety to hear how we are, especially as Annie seemed a little indisposed. Lida has had something of the same cruption, but they both took medicine, and are getting rid of it, without being made sick in the least. I could not take them to the Camp-meeting, as the weather was bad, and I was fearful of giving trouble by taking them with me. We enjoyed the meeting very much, hearing excellent sermons, and feeling joy at the conversion of those in whom we were interested. Among the preachers were Dr. Jeter, Dr. Burrowes, Mr. Adams of Baltimore and several others of distinction. I was glad to make the acquaintance of Aunt Lucy, Uncle William F. Broadus' wife. She is a very jovial pleasant companion, and I felt like I had known her for some time. I find no difficulty whatever in claiming kin with them both, their manners are so kind and affectionate. I am quite anxious to pay them a visit in Fredericksburg, and hope to do so before very long, should nothing prevent. I came back to Mr. Bicker's Friday evening, but Mr. Broadus was so much interested, he remained till the next morning. That night about 20 persons professed conversion, among whom was Martin Burnley. The boys doubtless recollect him. We staid at Mr. Bicker's until this morning, when we had promised to return to the C. H., and as there was some difficulty in getting us baggage and all here in the carriage, we concluded to come in the wagon. I havn't been in a wagon before for many a long day, but although I feared the jolting we had a very pleasant ride. As we had only three miles to come it couldn't last long. Sister Martha is in good health and spirits, and her children although delicate in appearance, are quite well. She has partly promised to pay us a visit during the coming twelve months. I have heard that Cousin Betsey Thompson was not well. I suppose I shall see some one of the family to-morrow. I have so short a time to stay here that I must confess I don't care about seeing people much, and experience a feeling of regret at hearing that I am to receive several visits to-morrow. I suppose you are all comfortably settled now. Mary and Mr. Smith at home again, and Grandpa &amp; Grandma at the University. I am sorry to be away at this time, as I am afraid that I shall have but little of their society. I hope Grandma's health is good now, and that she has derived great benefit from her summer's travels. We shall be at home next Wednesday, and I suppose they will still be with you at that time. I feel quite anxious to hear whether any movement has been made with regard to Dr. Smith's house. I am so uneasy for fear that we cannot move before the 1st of October, and that time would suit us so much better than any other. I mean to hope that all will come right, as Mr. Broadus says, and does too, notwithstanding the prospect is not perfectly clear. Have those presses been made yet? I am sorry that I didn't speak myself to Dr. Howard about them, but I mean to be satisfied with whatever is done. If you should see Margaret Swann, tell her that Mama did not go to the Camp-meeting, in consequence of finding her sister Mrs. Pendleton at Culpeper C. H. After she left though, she staid with us at Mr. Bicker's, and came here with us to-day. She is well, and has gone out now to see Miss Betty Ward and her sister Matilda. I think she said she would write to Margaret soon. I can't think of anything that would be of especial interest to you, except to mention that I saw Mr. Latham, and Dr. Bowen &amp; his bride at the Camp-meeting. Tell Grandma that Mrs. Bowen inquired most affectionately after her, and expressed the hope that she &amp; Grandpa would visit her Mother &amp; Father this summer. I never saw happiness more plainly expressed in any countenance than in that of Dr. Boen. He was a student about six years ago. I saw Mrs. Newby also, (formerly Miss Georgiana Ward) She recollects her visit to the University with great delight. I don't wonder that every body treasures up a sweet recollection of that place, for I have the same feeling towards it myself, and love to hear strangers praise it. Mr. Broadus unites with me in love to you and Papa, Mary and Mr. Smith, Grandpa &amp; Grandma, and all the boys, and Rosalie. If you can write to me I shall be glad to receive a letter from you while I am here. But I don't want you to write if you are too busy. Affectionately your daughter, Maria C. Broadus</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philadelphia— Oct 6, '55 My dear Eliza, We reached this place without accident on Monday to dinner, after staying two days in Baltimore, where we arrived on the day we left you before sunset. I have been very busy running about to the Post Office, Bank, etc. and have concluded to stop at the Pierre Home, but tho' the Home is excellent we are not accomodated to our liking as to rooms being compelled to do without a sitting room or to take a very small one &amp; pay for ourselves &amp; servant $44 a week. Mrs Pico asked us for two rooms $50 a week. Tell Mary Emmet that Eliza Tucker desired me to say that she would be glad she would stop there &amp; see her sisters. We dined with them on Sunday last. Besides these, two other young ladies from Bermuda are their guests. They are a sister of Tom Hall's &amp; his betrothed a daughter of Mr. Daniel Tucker's— so that I presumo their house is nearly full. Tell Dr. Harrison that I hear there will be a dividend on the Rock Island stock in January, &amp; that the present low price is imputed not so much to their diminished receipts as to the purposes of the Directors to lower the price of stock with a view to speculation, according to the abominable system so prevalent with New York Directors. Louisa sends you her love &amp; thanks for all your kindness, &amp; joins me in love to all around you. I am your ever affectionate father George Tucker P. S. I have advertised to rent my house ready furnishedm &amp; have already had four applications for it. I am just about to go to shew it to some of the applicants. (Mrs. Tucker's hand-writing) Kiss my dear little children for me &amp; do not let Maria Louisa forget me tell her I will write her a little letter soon. I beg you to remember me most kindly to Flora &amp; indeed to all your good servants who were all kind to me—also my best regards to the Doctor, the last not least in my estimation— &amp; the boys. tell I suppose she has had a visit from her ——beau. Willy Dunglison is to be married on Tuesday. We are invited to the wedding. Miss Trist on Wednesday next—the day after W. D. Jeff Trist was married some days ago. Yours most affectionately L. A. T. P. S. Remember me to Mary &amp; Jane &amp; give my best love to Mary Jane Harrison when she comes—this morning brought with last night 8 applications for our house. I shall have to go there &amp; see it cleaned thougherly paint &amp; windows up to the 5th Story, &amp; all the carpets put down before any one will take it, also pack all our house linene &amp; clothes-&amp; china &amp; glass-&amp; books-a heavy job for me to superintend—my girl Sarah I suppose will come today &amp; can help me I have in traveling taken a bad cold-but otherwise continue better. No old attacks Yours L. A. T.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Midway October 12th 1855 My dear Sister: As I know you are anxious to hear from little Lucy, I embrace the first opportunity of sending you tidings from her. Doctors Anderson &amp; Bibb have both pronounced her out of danger now &amp; without a relapse will very soon be in her usual health. The Bronchial symptoms have not yielded yet altogether, but they think will, with the use of Hive syrup &amp; the wearing of flannel. She has been very sprightly today, most too much so for my comfort for I am often compelled to check her. Hor appetite too is getting very good &amp; I am greatly troubled to control her in eating. `Want to eat' is her almost constant song, &amp; she wants things she ought not to have. I hope to be able to control her however &amp; that she may recover entirely and relieve me from the fatigue &amp; anxiety of nursing her. I feel very tired &amp; out of sorts from my constant confinement with her. Her blister is drying up-causes her very little pain now. I was feeling so anxious &amp; nervous while you were here, my dear sister, that it seems to me but like a dream that you made us the visit. `Twas a comfort, a great comfort to me to have you with me when Lulie was so sick, but it grieves me now to think I did so little to contribute to your pleasure while with us. I comfort myself however by the reflection, that you know the feelings of a mother under such circumstances &amp; this is a sufficient apology to offer. Johnnie &amp; the girls failed to get back in the evening of the day you left as they expected. Cousin Hettie would have them to spend the night with her. Fannie tells me that she is much more cheerful than when she last saw her. I am glad to hear it, but poo woman, I know she has times of deep, deep sorrow. Sallie Bear is making preparation to go with Fannie to the Petersburg school. Mrs. Stevens is extremely desirous that she should go, &amp; no doubt will be of incalculable advantage to her to be thrown more upon her own resources than she can be while with her aunt. Tho' I have been expecting a letter from over the mountains for some time it has not come yet. Mother &amp; all are in at least their usual health I imagine or we would have heard from them before this. It may be that we will hear by tomorrow's mail. Have you heard from them since Carrie's letter came? How are Mary &amp; her babe getting on. I hope they have suffered no inconvenience from the changeable weather we have had of late. A great deal of love to her from me if you please. I am looking forward with a great deal of pleasure when I shall see her again. Maria &amp; her children are well I hope-love to her, Mr. Broadu Brother, George the two Hosalies, &amp; the boys. The family unite in sending love to yourself &amp; family. I hope to get up early enough in the morning to send Brother a piece of mutton. I hope to hear from you soon. Ever your attached sister Mary F. Harrison Carrie says you will please to look in the top drawer of the bureau in the room which she occupied &amp; get the pattern of silk-fold it so as to fit the carpet-bag to be brought out, &amp; wrap around it an additional paper &amp; get uncle Daniel to bring it to her tomorrow There is a pair of bishop's lawn sleeves in the same drawer which she would be obliged to you to send also. She sends love to Brother, yourself &amp; all.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Oct 15th 1855 Dear Sis E. Yours of 2nd inst was received and ought to have been acknowledged are this but I have been much engaged and could not very well have written sooner. I am thankful to be able to say we are all well. Pa appears to be better than usual for him. Our city has been highly favoured of Providence this fall—in an exemption from all Epidemics, and indeed it has been unusually healthy which calls loudly upon us for gratitude to the Author of all our mercies. The Maryland Institute is now having its annual exhibition it is represented as being much superior to any former one, and is very numerously visited. The girls and E.R. have season tickets, and go whenever they please. I do not feel any disposition to mingle in such scenes, and therefore stay away. I know how to sympathize with you in the privations to which you refer, but our heavenly Father is not confined to places and while we trust in him and seek to please him, we shall realize his presence and favour. We have our Closets and his written word, means instituted by himself and through them he has often revealed his love to the hearts of his Children. From these sources I have drawn my chief consolation and support in my deepest sorrow. Truly the Lord has sustained me around and about me have been the everlasting arms, and though I cannot understand why my dearest comfort was taken from me, yet I feel that it is my duty to submit. I believe that He who has taken my beloved to a mansion of bliss, will guide all my steps and wandering below, and if I am faithful until death I shall be reunited again in an eternal reunion with my dearly loved ones around the throne of God. Pray for me. I have had a Tombstone placed over the hallowed grave of my dearest Love. The base is plain white marble-surmounted by a slab of Italian, the whole surmounted by an urn of the purest white—on the upper part is a wreath in the centre of which is the words "To my Husband", below the wreath is his name ago and death in large raised letters, and then follows the inscription. The verse of Scripture was selected by himself. (The foot stone is plain with his Initials on it). It is plain but very neat-and said to be very pretty by those of my friends in whose judgement I could confide. I should like Mr. S. and you to see it. I hope he will come on next month. Try and come with him if it is only for a few days. Ma and the girls send their kindest regards. E. R. is very busy with her lessons. She joins me in love to all. Write soon. yr aff Sister Eliza P. Hamilton (Mrs. M. G. Hamilton to Mrs. D.G. Smith)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Harrisonburg, Va.Oct. 23 Mrs. Maria C. BroadusUniversity of Virginia Harrisonburg October 24th 1855 My dear Maria, I am really ashamed your kind letter to Ma has remained so long unanswered. You know my failing in regard to writing letters, but I think I would have made an effort to have written before this, if Caroline had not talked of writing to you every week after your letter was received, till she left. Since then I have been very much engaged. Have you gone to the Parsonage yet? and how are you pleased? We have not heard from the University for several weeks, and dont know your movements. It will be very pleasant to you to be so near your fathers family &amp; Mary. You will have much to occupy you the first year if you attempt to improve the grounds around your house. George said you would not have many conveniences. That is unfortunate as it is difficult for housekeepers to get along well without closets etc etc. Margaret is fully installed in house keeping but it is not by any means agreeable situated as she is. She is to sensitive an independent in her feelings to be at ease. I hope after awhile she will like it better. Her health is better. Her face is somewhat improved, but her eyes are still very weak. She can use them very little. Willie is well, grows very fast, and still says and does many smart things her friends think. She has been begging all day to go with her father to Alexandria. He leaves tomorrow, &amp; would go if her Mother would consent. She frequently speaks of Lida &amp; Annie &amp; her other cousins. Our family circle is very small at present. We number but four, Ma, Fannie, Mr. Clarke &amp; myself. Clarissa &amp; Emma are our all the servants at home. Fannie is at Miss Bettie Bears all day except at meals. We have it very quiet &amp; lonely. Ma has been in better health the last two months. She has been able to sit up the greatest portion of every day &amp; looks stronger &amp; better. She has been however somewhat more ailing the last week, has taken come cold I presume. She will expose herself more than she ought. She has been visiting some, spent several evenings out, and several days at Cousin Julia's. Her spirits are at least cheered by going out some, if she derives no other advantage. Mr. Clarke has been very much indisposed for several weeks with a bad cold &amp; cough, not able to attend to his duties part of the time. He is now improving &amp; I hope will soon be well. He has not been blessed with any fruits of his labors with us yet. We are looking forward to our Quarterly meeting next week with interest, hoping &amp; praying some good many be done &amp; revival is greatly needed in our Church &amp; all the Churches here. It is thought Mr. Clarke is an admirer of Miss Lucie Stevens. She is a fine young lady. He will be fortunate if he succeeds in winning her. We had a marriage in town last week, Miss Sue Heneberger and Dr. Dold. He has gained a fortune by marriage if not by the practice of medicine. His profession has not been very profitable to him. Aunt Baxter is in bad health. She is now suffering with a cold &amp; cough. I fear she will not live long. She is failing faster in strength &amp; health than Ma. I hope Mr. Broadus us in better health. George said he was somewhat ailing. His duties will not be so arduous at the University as in town. He and brother failed to make us the second visit they half promised. We looked for them till the session began or at least till George came. Though his visit was unexpected we were delighted to see him &amp; would have been glad to have kept him longer. I suppose you have seen but little of Caroline. She has spent most of her time at Mr. Rodes. She will go to the University shortly I presume to spend some time. I have not heard from her for ten days. We are anxious to hear how Lucy is. She was quite sick when we heard last. Ma, Margaret &amp; Fannie join me in much love to Mr. Broadus &amp; yourself with kisses to the children. Give our love to your fathers family and Mary. I hope you will not follow my example &amp; delay writing so long. We are always glad to hear from you. Your affectionate Aunt Mary J. Harrison (RSH)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Cincinnati, Nov 1st 1855. My dear friend, This is a dull, damp, unpleasant afternoon: just the kind of day, that makes one enjoy staying in the house, and talking with their friends. I would enjoy a talk with you this afternoon very much, if you were only here, but as you are not here, I must do the best I can, by talking with my pen. I suppose by this time, you have almost gotten to feel at home in your new house. The University I know seems more like home to you than the town does, so there is no necessity of my asking you "How you like the University?" and "If you have ever seen the place before"? Have you commenced bringing up your family of chickens yet? You remember that was one thing that made you want to live at the University. Since I parted from you, I have seen a great many persons and things, and have been in two or three different places, so that if I were to try to tell about all that has taken place, I would have to write such a long letter, that I think you would get tired, before you would have read half through it; so I will content myself, with writing about some few things. Let me commence with Dayton. I have fallen quite in love with the place. I cannot as yet say much about the people, for I have only gotten acquainted with a very few, but the city is such a clean, white, pleasant one. I do think sister should be thankful, that she has such a home. I am so glad she is not living in this black city, Cincinnati. It is a little more than two weeks, since I came down here. I am making a visit to my uncle Alexander McGuffey. I expect to return to Dayton next Tuesday. I am getting quite anxious to get back, to see my nephew Willie. He is a great boy of course. I would not be surprised if he were talking bythe time I return to Dayton. Who would have thought, that after all my expectations of having the whole of this afternoon for writing, I should be interrupted. But so it is; a servant has just come in, and told me that a cousin of mine, is coming to take me to a concert this evening. So as I have to write another letter, and have also to dress (a very important thing this last) before the time for the concert, I will have to send you a shorter letter than I intended. If you can find the time to write to me, I will be very glad to hear from you. How is your sister Mary's health now? I hope her eyes are much better. When you write, tell me all the news. I will be glad to hear about every one at the University. Will you be so kind, as to tell father or Laura, the first time you see them, that they may direct their letters to me to Dayton. When I last wrote to them, I told them to send their letters to Cincinnati; I expected then to have remained here longer than until next Tuesday. Give my love to Mr. Broadus, and a kiss to each of your little ones. Please also remember me to your father, mother, and sister Mary. I remain your true friend Henrietta McGuffey (RSH)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Paris, Nov. 7th, 1855 My Dear Wife, Your very welcome letter of the 20th Oct. found me yesterday in London—-at ½ past 8 last night we left via Dover &amp; Calais &amp; today at 11 we reached this most splendid city in the world. First however let me advert to the contents of yr letter. It contains much of interest. You had previously written me about Tommy's profession of religion, but said nothing about the girls. I trust their young hearts may become thoroughly imbued with the love of Christ &amp; that they may never lose these sacred influencces, but live &amp; grow in them daily. I am really grieved to hear of poor Sutter's death. I hopes he would get well—how does his poor wife bear it! like a true Christian no doubt! truly poor Brother &amp; Sister Sutton have had afflictions to come heavily upon them. May God enable them to bear all &amp; yet praise Him. Poor M. Preston, yet why say poor—he is blessed—in having a disposition a desire to turn to Christ. May he if still living have faith saving faith &amp; if already gone may his heart have been cheered with the sweet assurance that his sins were all forgiven—through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. how empty do all things earthly seem, when afflictions lie heavily upon us. How utterly insufficient is all that earth can give us—when we feel that death is near. Oh Lord grant that we, all of us, may have Christ formed within our hearts the hope of Glory. To promise ourselves any such happiness we must walk in his commandments &amp; statutes blamelessly. God help us to do so. Sunday morning last I heard preaching in the Wesleyan Chapel on City Road street London—the chapel was built by Mr. Wesley—the interior is very handsome yet neat the wa;;s are filled with monuments under the galleries &amp; in the rear. The pulpit does not stand against the rear wall but some twenty feet out. The recess is a semicircle &amp; used for the communion, in this recess are slabs to Jno. &amp; Chas. Wesley, Fletcher, Coke, Watson &amp; some other distinguished Wesletans. The congregation was a good one, yet not over 30 remained to communion. In the afternoon we went to St. Paul's Uathedral, probably the handsomest Cathedral in the world &amp; heard a sermon, and chaunting of all the Psalms and Paryers—the chaunting is all by Men &amp; Boys, in white gowns, and is thrilling beyond description. The organ is fine toned &amp; when the sound swells through the long aisles &amp; lofty arches it is sublime. William &amp; myself on Monday went up to the top of the ball 660 feet high, it is very laboring. We went also to the Tower of London which I must tell you about when we meet. I was very sick crossing the channel last night, as were nearly all the passengers &amp; my head is not yet clear of it. We are at the Hotel Windsor on the Rue Rivoli which runs along side the Tuileries. I suppose one of the most magnificent public gardens in the world, at lower side commences the Champ-Elysses—a most beautiful drive lined with trees on each side, here is also a great open place or square covered with grand Monuments &amp; rising in the center the Luxor (a tall shaft covered with Hieroglyphics) brought from Egypt by Napoleon &amp; supposed over 3000 years old. The sight is grand beyond description, carriages driving in every direction, soldiers on horseback &amp; on foot, pedestrians male &amp; female, people from every land you may say &amp; rising near all the magnificent Palme d'Industrie or Chrystal Palace, whilst we were in the midst of this exciting scene this afternoon we observed the mounted guards &amp; foot police actively clearing out the road, when presently came furiously by the Imperial carriages, these with four horses to each with postiooions and outriders, whipping &amp; spurring the horses to their utmost speed. We could not see the inmates but I understood the Emperor was in one of the carriages. They drove up to the Crystal Palace. Wm. &amp; myself went in but saw nothing of the Royal party. It is now bed time. I will reserve a small space for the morning &amp; then close, so good night &amp; God bless you all. Thursday Nov. 8th, 1855 Dear Sally—I have but little more to add as my page is nearly full. This is a charming day. Paris is gay, smiling and doubtless happy. The French are the happiest looking people in the world—you will be delighted when you come over with the bright looks of the handsome chamber maids, with the neatest white caps on, jabbering away in French and looking as innocent as doves, and may be for aught I know. Every thing is done here to amuse the people that can be imagined, that is the policy of the government, to keep them from feeling that they are oppressed. William is complaining of his foot, he hurt it going up to Adl—- Seat near Edinburgh &amp; has not gotten over it. Kiss Charley, Lizzy, Ally, Carry, Lelia, Rosalie, Tommy, Robby &amp; Nanny &amp; take 1000 for yourself. Love to all &amp; every body. Farewell &amp; may Heaven bless you. Ever your William (This is from Mr. William Bell to his wife. He was the grandfather of Elizabeth Echols. EDG)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Philadelphia, Nov 15, '55 My dear Eliza, I wrote to you yesterday, &amp; from a lapse of memory, very common to me of late, I directed my letter to the University, instead of your new residence. I write now, however principally to ask you for the address of your uncle Farley. Maria sent me a letter from him to her in which he expresses a great desire that I would write to him, &amp; I set about doing so, but his letter was dated at "Creole" simply, &amp; I find by the gazeteers that there are several places so called in different states, &amp; tho' I was under the impression that he lived in Missouri yet to be ceratin I thought I would first ascertain the fact from you. Love to all. I am unalterably yours Geo. Tucker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Nov 17th 1855 Dear Sis E. Yours of the 9th inst came safe to hand, and I was glad to hear you were all well, prosperous and happy. I am at a loss for something interesting to communicate to you, and I fancy I hear you exclaim can it be possible that any one living in a large city can be at a loss for something to write about. The ladies are taken up with gayety, dress, and fashion as usual, and the gentlemen are deeply engrossed with politics and though I feel thankful that the recent election resulted as it did and thereby secured to us State Officers of true American principles, and two Congressmen of the right stamp, yet I feel little interest in things of this sort. Last Thursday was thanksgiving day and as Kate wanted me to dine with her I went to Broadway Church, so as to be convenient to her house. Norval Wilson preached an excellent sermon on national gratitude and submission to God. It was a sorrowful day to me throughout my mind was constantly recurring to the mournful scenes through which I had passed since the last thanksgiving. I trust I felt grateful for that sustaining grace which was so freely given to me, and I strive daily to commit all my ways and interests into the hands of the Lord. I am glad you have not given up the idea of visiting us this season. We shall all be very glad to see you and Mr. Smith. We are very well except Pa, and he is getting better. Our love to all. Write soon and let us know when we may expect you. your affectionate Sister Eliza P. Hamilton</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Nov. 17th 1855 My Dear Aunt I was very much gratified when I received your kind letter but have not had time to answer it. I have been going to school constantly and I am obliged to study hard to keep up in my classes. I suppose Ma has told you that I have left Mr. Carter's and am going to the Misses Hull's Academy on Fayette St. In your last letter to Ma you speak of coming to see us either the last of this month or the first of next. Do not fail to come and to come soon for I want to see you very much. You have doubtless heard of the American victory achieved in this State at the last election. It was celebrated by a grand torchlight procession on Wednesday night nearly every house in our neighborhood was illuminated and flowers were seen in great profusion; the procession was very long and said to be the finest in our city ever witnessed we are all well except Grand Pa who has been very sick but is now able to sit up.

I write therefore to say that the child has been better again today, and seems but slightly indisposed. Willie &amp; Thornton are both much better. If you ask me if I have wholly abandoned all idea of going to the conference, I can only say that I have been too busy to think of it, and will probably allow the time to go by while I am undecided.

      <field name="fulltext">Charlottesville Nov. 30, 1855 Mr. F. H. Smith Dear Sir, If you desire to retain the servant Lucy another year, will you be so good as to inform me, at some early day, that I may know whether to seek a place for her elsewhere. In consideration of her somewhat delicate health, the terms of hire asked will be the same as heretofore. Lucy's mistress is under the impression from what she has heard from other servants, that Lucy's rheumatism is perhaps aggravated by her sleeping apartment being paved with brick—the brick floor being always liable to dampness. If this be so, perhaps it would not be amiss to suggest, if you retain her in your service, that a plank floor might be put down, over the bricks, which would probably render her less subject to attacks of rheumatism, and make her health better, as well as enable her to be more useful in your service. Very respectfully yours Allan B. Magruder</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mt. Jackson Dec 12th Dear Cousin Since writing to you a few days ago, in which I said I wished you to get me some winter flowers, amd linning for a straw Bonnet, which I intended to wear this winter, I concluded this morning, that it was so much soiled, that I would not get linning and flowers for it, but would write to you to make me one. I saw Cousin Mary Bonnet, and think it is very pretty, except the colour, and I would prefer any other colour to green as I do not like green very much. Fanny I will leave you to select the colour for I know you have more taste than I have. I would like to have it by next Friday I do not wish it to cost more than Cousin Mary's, as I think hers is fine enough for this neighbourhood. I will pay you for it when I see you. The family send their love. Your affectionate Cousin Bettie (To Fanny Stuart)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Balt. Jan 1st 1856 Dear Sister E. Two months have nearly passed away since I heard from you. I feel quite uneasy about you. Is any thing the matter. I thought the reason why you did not write might possibly be that you and Mr. Smith were coming on, but Winter having come upon us so heavily, I relinquish all hope of seeing any of you before the Spring. The New Year finds us in the enjoyment of our usual health, surrounded with many blessings for which I feel unfeignedly thankful. The past year has been the darkest and most sorrowful of my life—every day the void occasioned by the loss of my beloved seems to enlarge and press more heavily upon me, and at this season when all around me has been gay and cheerful, I have withdrawn as it were within myself and communed with departed joys, until my poor heart has ached with its burden of grief. Yet I anticipate a joyful reunion in a better world. The God whom he loved and served has promised to be the Friend, the Guide, the God of the Widow and the Father of the Fatherless, and on his faithful word I do and will rely. He has supported and kept me thus far, and I feel willing still to put my trust in him and to commit all my ways and Interests to his care and keeping. E. R. is very well, and is now at school. She grows very fast and becomes more and more like her dear father. She has that same cheerful amiable affectionate disposition and it is my daily prayer that she may resemble him in those moral and christian virtues which so beautifully adorned his character and life. Pa seems to be about as usual. The rest are well. The weather is clear and cold. The health of our City is good. I hope you will let me hear from you very soon. Ma &amp; the girls send their love. Our love to all. yr affectionate Sister Eliza P. Hamilton Mrs. M. G. Hamilton to Mrs. D. G. Smith)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Mrs.Gessner HarrisonUniversity of Virginia Philad.a Jan 14, 1856 My dear Eliza, I am several letters in your debt, but presumed that my letters to your husband would be the same as if to yourself. Uour last &amp; the Doctor's, written since, both reached me yesterday, the deep snow having delayed the mails. I may write to the Doctor upon his new plan, if anything occurs more than what I shall now say. If he builds on the slope of the hill, as he proposes, the basement story may be of stone, which I believe is abundant there, and that is much cheaper than either brick or wood. On this account, and on account of the saving in the roof n would be cheaper than the one I sent. I am not sure that I understand how he proposes to get on the upper floor of 4 rooms—a Passage of only 4 feet would not admit of a stair from one passage to the other. Perhaps he would have that also on the outside. I was very glad to hear that the dispute with Philips was settled, for I did not know but the Doctor was completely in his power as his heaviest payment of interest, &amp; will not be until after two years, while the consideration he pays will be during this year, and I rate what he will probably get at $700 or $800. I do not think he is as much worsted by Philips's after clap as he thinks. If the note discounted for the Doctor was for 90 days, I apprehend I shall feel no difficulty in taking it up before it becomes due. Certainly not if I receive what I am warranted in counting on. I fear now I have no chance of getting my Texas debt this year. Fortunately I have never allowed myself to count on it, so that the disappointment will produce no practical inconvenience. I was greatly grieved to hear of poor Jack's accident. Let me know how he gets one. I have for the first winter I have been in Phila. have had no fall this year. I presume that as my limbs get naturally stiffer I take more pains in walking—but in more than 20 falls I never sustained the least injury, for my practice is when I find I have lost my balance, I quietly lie down. But I spoke too fast. I have twice had falls in which I was hurt, once on stairs, &amp; again at the door atops, when I could neither recover myself, nor pursue my plan of lying quietly down. I have never received the letter from George which you said he was to write, btu as I knew he had his hands full I excused him, &amp; still excuse him if a letter would interfere with his studies. The weather has been distressingly cold here, as it was with you. The thermometer shews, as I always thought, that there was little difference between the climate of Philadelphia &amp; the University, your greater elevation being equal to our more Northern latitude. Your mother sends you her love, &amp; joins me in remembrances to all the children etc. You say nothing of Mary's eyes. I am your Ever affectionate father G. Tucker</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Midway January 21st 1856 My dear Sister: Again and again I have thought of your request and my promise to you when leaving your house; but it seems only to defer as often its fulfillment. I have many apologies to offer for my neglected duty, but the most weighty of all is my bodily sufferings, with those feelings of desperation to which I have so long been a victim. I sometimes think I feel worse than I did-even when I would have cast from me the children that God has given me. How strange it is that I cannot be rid of this awful distress of mind. I know that disease is at the bottom of it all, or I am sure my reason would be gone. I try to submit-to bear patiently that which the Lord sees fit to send upon me, but I often have great want of faith, sometimes feel there is no interest for me in the Saviour of mankind. Yet I cannot let go entirely, a faint, glimmering hope still keeps my head above the waters. I know that the most heinous of all sins is to doubt the willingness &amp; ability of God my Saviour to save me, tho' the chief of sinners. Still my heart is so prone to unbelief. My dear sister may I ask you to pray for me-Oh pray earnestly that in my nakedness &amp; utter helplesness I may so approach my Saviour that he will give me pardon &amp; peace, &amp; joy in believing. I would not trouble you with my sorrows, did I not know that you would extend me sympathy, &amp; bear me up at the Throne of grace which in some measure relieves my heart. Oh I have been a great sinner, but to save sinners was Christ's mission on earth, and oh that I may be enabled to flee unto him, &amp; bring glory &amp; honour to his most worthy name. I have suffered much with my back and bowels since my visit to you. I cant bear much exercise you know, &amp; I walked rather much when visiting my friends in Charlottesville &amp; shopping. I have despaired ever recovering. My eyes too are very weak, &amp; I find it very difficult to do the necessary work for myself and my poor dear children. I am teaching Lutie a little. She is do full of life &amp; fun that 'tis not an easy task. She is now learning the 4th lesson in Worcester's primmer. Minnie I think is doing something better. She is now reading the New Testament regularly through-spelling, doing a little at arithmetic &amp; is getting on very well in Geography. Lucy I hope will de better after a while. How is George getting on with his school? I often think of him when teaching my charge. I hope he gets on with but little trouble now-a-days. What a fall of snow, or rather what falls of snow we have had. I have no recollection of seeing it of such a depth. The poor of the land must suffer for want of fire, if not for food. Carrie I suppose is still with you. When does she think of going home? If not soon I hope to see her again. I shall have to go down to get Dr. Wise to fix my teeth, &amp; would be glad to have her with me. From what I have heard of Bro's purchase you must be pleased with it; I am sorry that you go farther from us, but the distance is not very great. You will have a very nice home &amp; I hope that Brother will be successful in his undertaking. Maria &amp; Mary with their families are well I hope. My love to each one of them, &amp; to Bro., Carrie, George, the Rosalies &amp; Edward &amp; all the boys. The children send love to all. Affectionately your sister Mary N. B. Please say to Carrie that Bro. Ross brought the shoes &amp; letters, &amp; I will write to her if she remain any length of time. Have you heard from over the mountains lately? I have not heard the first of December. Friday morning. I am feeling very badly; but expect to go to Mr. Chapman's tomorrow. I will be glad to hear from you very soon.</field>
