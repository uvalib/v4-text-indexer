      <field name="fulltext">IN MEMORIAM This study is published in memory of the late Marie Goebel Kimball. Her Jeffersonian writings enriched the world of scholarship, and her recent bequest to the University of Virginia will make possible the further enrichment of the University's Jeffersonian collections.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A Reconstruction of Jefferson's Fine Arts Library It was Thomas Jefferson who originally selected and arranged for the purchase of the fine arts books at the University of Virginia. A few of the very volumes acquired by Jefferson for the University's library have survived the ravages of time and fire, and in recent years an effort has been made to replace all books in the original group that have not survived. Books ordered but never acquired are also being searched for. Limited funds and limited opportunities have left a list of works needed that is still a long one, but a report on the projected reassembly is in order for several reasons. The chief object in publishing the list of desiderata in its present form is to give interested persons the opportunity of helping the University of Virginia in a reconstruction that will have the greatest importance for future students of the fine arts. Gifts of volumes needed, or of funds for their purchase as the books appear on the market, will be heartily welcomed. The books still needed by the University are first listed, in alphabetical order to facilitate easy checking. They are listed in the present-day fashion of bibliographical citation to show exactly which edition is needed. Following the main desiderata list in an analysis of its sources, with a brief historical sketch of Jefferson's efforts to furnish the University of Virginia with a proper library in the fine arts. Finally, there is appended a list of books that have survived from the original Jeffersonian collection in the fine arts, or have been added as replacements, or are duplicates of volumes in Jefferson's private architectural libraries. The combination of the two lists as they stand will be of permanent interest to the student of Jeffersonian architecture.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Desiderata List Books needed by the University of Virginia in its reconstruction of Jefferson's original fine arts library, or in duplicating Jefferson's private architectural collections. ABERDEEN, GEORGE HAMILTON-GORDON, 4TH EARL OF. AN INQUIRY INTO THE PRINCIPLES OF BEAUTY IN GRECIAN ARCHITECTURE. London, 1822. Jefferson ordered it for the University, and a copy had been received by 1828, but the library now has only the 1860 reprint in Weale's Scientific and Technical Series. [1] ALBERTI, LEONE BATTISTA. L'ARCHITECTURA DI LEONBATISTA ALBERTI; TRADOTTA IN LINGUA FIORENTINA DA COSIMO BARTOLI . . . CON LA AGGIUNTA DE' DISEGNI. Venice, 1565. Jefferson sold his copy to Congress: Sowerby 4199. [2] ARTEAGA, ESTEBAN. LE RIVOLUZIONI DEL TEATRO MUSICALE ITALIANO. Bologna, 1783-88. 3 vols. Jefferson ordered all three volumes, but only two were received by the University, and these have not survived. Jefferson himself owned and sold to Congress the 3-volume edition of Venice 1785: Sowerby 4256. [3] BARLOW, PETER. AN ESSAY ON THE STRENGTH AND STRESS OF TIMBER. London, 1818. This was the second edition, which it may be assumed Jefferson had in mind when he ordered the book for the University. The first edition was 1817. The library has a copy of the 3rd edition of 1826, but this was issued after Jefferson's list was made up, perhaps even after Jefferson's death. There is no record of the library's having acquired any edition in Jefferson's lifetime. [4] BARTOLI, PIETRO SANTI. RACCOLTA DI GEMME ANTICHE FIGURATE, INCISE DA PIETRO SANTI BARTOLI ED ILLUSTRATE DA MICHELANGELO CAUSEO DE LA CHAUSSE. Rome, 1805. 2 vols. 2nd ed. Jefferson ordered it for the University, but there is no record of its ever having been received. The library now has of Bartoli's works, only his Admiranda Romanorum Antiquitatum, 1693. [5] BASAN, PIERRE FRANCOIS. DICTIONNAIRE DES GRAVEURS ANCIENS ET MODERNES DEPUIS L'ORIGINE DE LA GRAVURE; AVEC UNE NOTICE DES PRINCIPALES ESTAMPES QU'ILS ONT GRAVEES. SUIVI DES CATALOGUES DES OEUVRES DE JACQUES JORDANS, &amp; DE CORNEILLE VISSCHER. PAR F. BASAN. Paris, 1767. 3 vols. Jefferson apparently knew that the 3rd volume of this edition was omitted in the 1789 edition. He ordered the 1767 edition for the University, and it was in the collection by 1828, but it has not survived. [6] BECKER, WILHELM GOTTLIEB. NEUE GARTEN- UND LANDSCHAFTS-GABAUDE. Leipzig, 1798-99. 34 plates with descriptive text, issued in 4 folders. Jefferson's French title, "Plans d'architecture," is not on the book, but that this was the book ordered for the University in 1825 seems certain from Jefferson's use of the same title for the same work on the copy he sold to Congress: Sowerby 4223. [7] BIRCH, WILLIAM. THE CITY OF PHILADELPHIA, IN THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA NORTH AMERICA: AS IT APPEARED IN THE YEAR 1800 CONSISTING OF TWENTY EIGHT PLATES. Springfield Cot, Pa., 1800. Jefferson sold his copy to Congress: Sowerby 4161. The library has only a microcard edition. [8] BORGHINI, RAFAELLO. IL REPOSO, IN CUI DELLE PITTURA E DELLA SCULPTURA SI FAVELLA. Milan, 1807. 3 vols. The set was in the library before Jefferson made up his want list. It was more fully identified in the 1828 Catalogue. [9] BRUSCO, GIACOMO. DESCRIPTION DES BEAUTES DE GENES ET DE SES ENVIRONS, ORNEES DE DIFFERENTES VUES, DE TAILLES DOUCE, ET DE LA CARTE TOPOGRAPHIQUE DE LA VILLE. Genes, 1781. Jefferson sold his copy to Congress: Sowerby 3910. [10] BUILDER'S PRICE-BOOK; CONTAINING A CORRECT LIST OF THE PRICES ALLOWED BY THE MOST EMINENT SURVEYORS IN LONDON, TO THE SEVERAL ARTIFICERS CONCERNED IN BUILDING. THE FIFTH EDITION, CORRECT ED. BY AN EXPERIENCED SURVEYOR. London, 1788. Jefferson sold his copy to Congress: Sowerby 1181. [11] BUILDERS' PRICES, PHILADELPHIA, WASHINGTON, AND PITTSBURGH. [Philadelphia? post 1815? and ante 1826]. A copy was in Jefferson's library at the time of his death. The title, otherwise identified only as an 8vo, is from the 1829 sale catalogue, lot 243, but see also Thurlow &amp; Berkeley No. 1605. [12] CASLON, WILLIAM. A SPECIMEN OF PRINTING TYPES. London, 1764. Jefferson sold his copy to Congress: Sowerby 1135. The library has only the 1785 edition of this title, issued by the younger William Caslon. [13] CASTELL, ROBERT. THE VILLAS OF THE ANCIENTS ILLUSTRATED. London, 1728. Although ordered for the University, there is no record of its having been acquired. Jefferson's own copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4191. [14] CELLINI, BENVENUTO. OPERE. Milan, 1806-11. 3 vols. The first two volumes, comprising the VITA, were edited by Gio. Palamede Carpani. The third volume included the DUE TRATTI, etc. The work was already in the University's collection when Jefferson made up his want list. [15] CHAMBERS, SIR WILLIAM. DESIGNS OF CHINESE BUILDINGS, FURNITURE, DRESSES, MACHINES, AND UTENSILS. London, 1757. Jefferson ordered it, but there is no record of the library's ever having received the book. Jefferson's copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4220. The library has only a photo-copy of the 5-leaf preface to this work, of which Samuel Johnson was the supposed author. [16] CHAMBERS, SIR WILLIAM. PLANS, ELEVATIONS, SECTIONS, AND PERSPECTIVE VIEWS OF THE GARDENS AND BUILDINGS AT KEW, IN SURRY. London, 1763. Jefferson ordered it, and the library received a copy, but it has not survived. Jefferson's own copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4225. [17] CLARKE, EDWARD DANIEL. GREEK MARBLES BROUGHT FROM THE SHORES OF THE EUXINE, ARCHIPELAGO, AND MEDITERRANEAN, AND DEPOSITED IN THE VESTIBULE OF THE PUBLIC LIBRARY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE. Cambridge, 1809. Jefferson's "4" annotation on the order for this book either indicates an error on his part as to the number of volumes or else doubt as to whether the format was quarto or octavo. The book was in the collection by 1828 but has not survived. [18] CLENDENIN, JOHN. THE PRACTICAL SURVEYOR'S ASSISTANT. Philadelphia, 1793. Jefferson sold his copy to Congress: Sowerby 3709. [19] COETNEMPREN DE KERSAINT, ARMAND GUY SIMON, COMTE DE. DISCOURS SUR LES MONUMENS PUBLIQUES, PRONONCE AU CONSEIL DU DEPARTMENT DE PARIS, LE 15 DECEMBRE 1791, PAR ARMAND-GUY KERSAINT. Paris, 1792. This was ordered by Jefferson, but there is no record of the library's ever having acquired it. Jefferson's own copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4212. [20] COINTERAUX, FRANCOIS. ECOLE D'ARCHITECTURE RURALE. Paris, 1791. Jefferson sold his copy to Congress: Sowerby 1177. [21] COLLECTION OF PAPERS ON NAVAL ARCHITECTURE, ORIGINALLY COMMUNICATED THROUGH THE CHANNEL OF THE EUROPEAN MAGAZINE. THE SECOND EDITION. London, 1791-1800. 2 vols. Ordered by Jefferson for the University, but there is no record of the library's ever having received a copy. Jefferson's own copy, or at least part of it, he sold to Congress: Sowerby 1227. Miss Sowerby's annotation on the edition has not, however, been followed here, where the British Museum description has been copied. [22] DATI, CARLO ROBERTO. VITE DE' PITTORI ANTICHI. Milan, 1806. The work was in the library before Jefferson made up his want list. It was more fully identified in the 1828 Catalogue. [23] DELORME, PHILIBERT. NOUVELLES INVENTIONS POUR BIEN BASTIR ET A PETIT FRAIZ, TROUVEES N'A GUERES PAR PHILIBERT DE L'ORME. Paris, 1576. The library has an earlier edition of 1567, under the title Le Premier Tome de l'Architecture, but the first edition of this work under the 1576 title was in 1561. This is the same edition that Jefferson sold to Congress: Sowerby 4183. [24] DESGODETZ, ANTOINE BABUTY. LES EDIFICES ANTIQUES DE ROME. Paris, 1779. It was the Jombert edition that Jefferson owned: Sowerby 4198. And it was certainly also this edition that the 1828 catalogue described as "1729", presumably from a misreading of the Roman numerals. [25] DONATI, ALESSANDRO. ALEXANDRI DONATI . . . ROMA VETUS AC RECENS UTRIUSQUE. AEDIFICIIS ILLUSTRATA. Amsterdam, 1695. Jefferson ordered it, but there is no record of the library's having acquired it. Jefferson's own copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4185. [26] DURAND, JEAN NICOLAS LOUIS. RECUEIL ET PARALLELE DES EDIFICES DE TOUT GENRE. Paris, 1800. The date on the title page reads "An IX," which the 1828 catalogue took to mean 1801. [27] ENCYCLOPEDIE METHODIQUE, OU PAR ORDRE DE MATIERES, PAR UNE SOCIETE DE GENS DE LETTRES. Paris, 1782-1816. Not completed until 1832, this encyclopedia was to reach eventually to 102 numbers, or 337 parts, comprising 166 and a half volumes of quarto text and 51 parts of illustrations with a total of 6439 plates. Jefferson's own set, which he sold to Congress, contained 136 ½ volumes: Sowerby 4888. In 1828, the library had 162 of the volumes, probably all that had been issued to that date. Of these, only the volumes concerning Mathematics are now in the library, but these alone are enough to confirm that the dating of the set in the printed Catalogue of 1828 is wrong. The beginning date of 1787 given there is almost certainly a misprint for 1782, when the printing of the encyclopedia actually began. Jefferson, presumably to distinguish the set from the alphabetically arranged work of Diderot and D'Alembert, referred to it under the name of its first publisher, Panckoucke. Since the present listing concerns the fine arts, the following sections only are relevant, and indeed, as Brunet pointed out long ago, the volumes on the different subject matters have, for more than a century, usually been sold separately. ANTIQUITES ET MYTHOLOGIE. 10 parts in 5 vols., plus 2 vols. of 380 plates. ARCHITECTURE. 3 vols. ART ARATOIRE ET DU JARDINAGE. 1 vol. and 54 plates. ARTS AT METIERS. 16 parts in 8 vols., and 1509 plates. BEAUX-ARTS. 2 parts in 4 vols., and 1 vol. of 115 plates. MUSIQUE. 3 parts in 2 vols., with 188 plates. [28] ETIENNE, JEAN D'. MEMOIRE SUR LA DECOUVERTE D'UN CIMENT IMPENETRABLE A L'EAU; ET SUR L'APPLICATION DE CE MEME CIMENT A UNE TERRASSE DE LA MAISON DE L'AUTEUR. Paris, 1782. Jefferson ordered it for the University, but there is no record of its having been received by the library. Jefferson's copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4204. This edition was printed by Philippe-Denys Pierres, who a few years later was to print Jefferson's Notes on Virginia. [29] FELIBIEN, ANDRE, SIEUR DES AVAUX ET DE JAVERCY. ENTRETIENS SUR LES VIES ET SUR LES OUVRAGES DES PLUS EXCELLENS PEINTURES ANCIENS ET MODERNES: AVEC LA VIE DES ARCHITECTS. Amsterdam, 1706. 5 vols. This is the edition Jefferson sold to Congress: Sowerby 4248. See the note under Félibien in the appendix. [30] FERGUSON, JAMES. THE ART OF DRAWING IN PERSPECTIVE. London, 1775. The evidence for a copy of this work's having belonged to Jefferson is in the manuscript library catalogue now at the Massachusetts Historical Society. The book was apparently not sold to Congress, and does not appear in the 1829 sale catalogue. [30a] FICORONI, FRANCESCO. LE VESTIGIA E RARITE DI ROMA ANTICA. Rome, 1744. 2 vols. Jefferson ordered this in a single volume, and it is apparently sometimes so bound. There is no record of the library's ever having acquired the book, but Jefferson's own copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4196. [31] FREART DE CHAMBRAY, ROLAND. PARALLELE DE L'ARCHITECTURE ANTIQUE, SUIVANT LES DIX PRINCIPAUX QUI ONT ECRIT SUR LES CINQ ORDRES. PAR MM. ERRARD &amp; DE CHAMBRAY. Paris, 1766. See the entry under Jombert. The library has only the 4th edition, 1733, in the John Evelyn English translation. [32] GELL, SIR WILLIAM. POMPEIANA: THE TOPOGRAPHY, EDIFICES, AND ORNAMENTS OF POMPEII. BY SIR WILLIAM GELL . . . AND JOHN P. GANDY. London, 1817-19. Jefferson ordered it, but there is no record of the library's ever having received it. The library has only the partial reprint of 1880. under the title Pompeii, its Destruction and Re-Discovery. [33] GIBBS, JAMES. RULES FOR DRAWING THE SEVERAL PARTS OF ARCHITECTURE, IN A MORE EXACT AND EASY MANNER THAN HAS BEEN HERETOFORE PRACTISED. London, 1732. Jefferson in 1825 ordered the 1732 edition for the University, perhaps forgetting that it was the 1738 edition he had sold to Congress. See the next entry. There is no record of the University's ever having received the book. [34] GIBBS, JAMES. RULES FOR DRAWING THE SEVERAL PARTS OF ARCHITECTURE . . . THE SECOND EDITION. London, 1738. This is the edition Jefferson sold to Congress: Sowerby 4184. The library has an undated 20th-century reprint of it only. Kimball incorrectly identified the volume Jefferson sold to Congress as the 3rd edition of 1753. [35] GIBSON, ROBERT. A TREATISE OF PRACTICAL SURVEYING . . . THE SIXTH EDITION. Philadelphia, 1790. Jefferson sold his copy of this edition to Congress: Sowerby 3707. The earliest editions now in the library are those of 1792 and 1796. For a note on other editions of this book, see the Appendix. [36] HALFPENNY, WILLIAM, PRACTICAL ARCHITECTURE, OR A SURE GUIDE TO THE TRUE WORKING ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF THAT SCIENCE, REPRESENTING THE FIVE ORDERS, WITH THEIR SEVERAL DOORS AND WINDOWS, TAKEN FROM INIGO JONES AND OTHER CELEBRATED ARCHITECTS . . . London, 1724. The edition sold by Jefferson to Congress has not been postively identified: Sowerby 4186. The 1724 is Kimball's conjecture. The library has only his Twelve Beautiful Designs of 1750. [37] HANCARVILLE, PIERRE FRANCOIS HUGHES CALLED D'HANCARVILLE. RECHERCHES SUR L'ORIGINE, L'ESPRIT ET LES PROGRES DES ARTS DE LA GRECE. London, 1785. 3 vols.

WITH CRITICAL REMARKS: AND OBSERVATIONS ON THE MODERN TASTE IN GARDENING. London, 1777. 2 vols. The library has only a poor copy of the first volume, acquired in recent years. Jefferson ordered a copy for the University, but none was received in his lifetime. His own copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4228. [39] JESS, ZACHARIAH. A COMPENDIOUS SYSTEM OF PRACTICAL SURVEYING, AND DIVIDING OF LAND. 2d ed. Philadelphia, 1814. Jefferson had a copy in his private library at the time of his death. The 1829 sale catalogue (lot 414) does not specify the edition, but it seems unlikely that Jefferson would have owned the Wilmington 1799 first edition. [40] JOHNSON, STEPHEN WILLIAM. RURAL ECONOMY: CONTAINING A TREATISE ON PISE BUILDING. New-Brunswick, N.J., 1806. Jefferson sold his copy to Congress: Sowerby 1178. [41] JOMBERT, CHARLES ANTOINE. BIBLIOTHEQUE PORTATIVE D'ARCHITECTURE ELEMENTAIRE, A L'USAGE DES ARTISTES, DIVISEE EN 6 PARTIES. Paris, 1764-66. 4 parts, generally in 2 vols.

OEuvres d'Architecture de Vincent Scamozzi; 4. Parallèle de l'Architecture Antique avec la Moderne, suivant les dix principaux auteurs qui ont écrit sur les cinq ordres, par MM. Errard et de Chambray. Jefferson ordered the work, but there is no record of the library's having acquired it. Jefferson's own copies of the second and fourth parts were sold to Congress: Sowerby 4215-6. And all four of the parts were in his private library at the time of his death. They were sold as lot 723 in the 1829 sale. [42] JONES, INIGO. THE DESIGNS OF INIGO JONES, CONSISTING OF PLANS AND ELEVATIONS FOR PUBLICK AND PRIVATE BUILDINGS. PUBLISH'D BY WILLIAM KENT. London, 1727. 2 vols. in one. For a note on this edition, a copy of which Jefferson sold to Congress (Sowerby 4217), and on the edition of 1770, see the Appendix. [43] KELSALL, CHARLES. PHANTASM OF AN UNIVERSITY. London, 1814. The second part contains the architectural detail. The copy received by Jefferson for the University before he made up the want list was the gift of James Madison, but it has not survived. [44] KENNET, BASIL. ROMAE ANTIQUAE NOTITIA: OR, THE ANTIQUITIES OF ROME . . . WITH COPPER CUTTS OF THE PRINCIPAL BUILDINGS . . . ELEVENTH EDITION CORRECTED AND IMPROVED. London, 1746.

A WORK ENTIRELY NEW; DEDUCED FROM THE PRINCIPLES OF DR. BROOK TAYLOR; AND PERFORMED BY TWO RULES ONLY OF UNIVERSAL APPLICATION. London, 1761. 2 vols. Jefferson specifically ordered this edition, though there is no record of the library's having acquired it. Jefferson's own copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4207. The library has the 3rd edition of 1765. [46] KRAFFT, JOHANN KARL. PLANS, COUPES, ELEVATIONS DES PLUS BELLES MAISONS ET DES HOTELS CONSTRUITS A PARIS ET DANS LES ENVIRONS, PUBLIES PAR J.-CH. KRAFFT, ARCHITECTE, ET RANSONNETTE, GRAVEUR. Paris, 1801-1802. Issued in 20 parts. Text in French, German, and English, in parallel columns. Jefferson ordered it, but there is no record of the library's having acquired the book. Jefferson's own copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4214. [47] LA FAYE, POLYCARPE DE. RECHERCHES SUR LA PREPARATION QUE LES ROMAINS DONNOIENT A LA CHAUX, DONT ILS SE SERVOIENT POUR LEURS CONSTRUCTIONS, &amp; SUR LA COMPOSITION &amp; L'EMPLOI DE LEURS MORTIERS. Paris, 1777. Ordered by Jefferson for the University, but there is no record of the library's ever having received a copy. Jefferson sold his own copy to Congress: Sowerby 1176 and 4205. [48] LANDON, CHARLES PAUL. ANNALES DU MUSEE ET DE L'ECOLE MODERNE DES BEAUX-ARTS. Paris, 1800-09. 17 vols. and 4 vols. of Supplement. The library lacks volumes 1-3, and 17; see the entry in the Appendix. [49] LANGLEY, BATTY. PRACTICAL GEOMETRY, APPLIED TO THE ARTS OF BUILDING, SURVEYING, GARDENING AND MENSURATION . . . THE SECOND EDITION. London, 1729. This is the edition Jefferson sold to Congress: Sowerby 4185. The library has only this author's City and Country Builder's, and Workman's Treasury of 1740. [50] LE CLERC, SEBASTIEN. TRAITE DE GEOMETRIE THEORIQUE ET PRATIQUE, A L'USAGE DES ARTISTES. Paris, 1774. Jefferson sold his copy to Congress: Sowerby 3710. The library has only the 1764 edition of Jombert. [51] LE ROY, JULIEN DAVID. LES RUINS DES PLUS BEAUX MONUMENTS DE LA GRECE. Paris, 1758. 2 vols. This is the edition supplied to Jefferson for the University. Whether there was also in Jefferson's possession a London edition of 1759 in English, with the title RUINS OF ATHENS remains in doubt. See Sowerby 4189. [52] LIPSIUS, JUSTUS. ROMA ILLUSTRATA . . . ET GEORGII FABRICII CHEMNICENSIS VETERIS ROMAE . . . EX NOVA RECENSIONE ANTONII THYSII . . . London, 1692. Jefferson sold his copy to Congress: Sowerby 117. [53] LUBERSAC DE LIVRON, CHARLES FRANCOIS DE. DISCOURS SUR LES MONUMENS PUBLICS DE TOUS LES AGES ET DE TOUS LES PEUPLES CONNUS, SUIVI D'UNE DESCRIPTION DE MONUMENT PROJETE A LA GLOIRE DE LOUIS XVI ET DE LA FRANCE. Paris, 1775. 2 parts in one volume. This was ordered by Jefferson and bought for the University, but the copy has not survived. Jefferson's own copy was sold to Congress (Sowerby 4210) and has also disappeared. [54] MAPS. COLLECTION OF PLANS OF TOWNS. A large folio with this binder's title was sold by Jefferson to Congress. Miss Sowerby's note on it (No. 3859) gives the known details. In 1805 it was bound into an Atlas 16 × 22 inches. Before April 10, 1791, the collection contained plans of Frankfort on the Mayne, Carlsruhe, Amsterdam, Strasburg, Paris, Orleans, Bordeaux, Lyons, Montpelier, Marseilles, Turin, and Milan. Some of Jefferson's later purchases of American maps are also detailed by Miss Sowerby, though the chief group of these may have remained in Jefferson's private library until his death. Cf., for example, lot 347 in the 1829 sale catalogue: PLANS AND FORTS OF AMERICA, 8vo. [55] MARECHAL, PIERRE SYLVAIN. LES ANTIQUITES D'HERCULANUM. Paris, 1780-1803. 12 vols. The library lacks volumes 10-12. See the entry in the Appendix. [56] MASCHERONI, LORENZO. NUOVE RICERCHE SULL' EQUILIBRIO DELLE VOLTE. Bergamo, 1785. Jefferson's copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4203. The library has several of Mascheroni's geometrical works. [57] MAUCOMBLE, JEAN FRANCOIS DIEUDONNE. HISTOIRE ABREGEE DE LA VILLE DE NISMES, AVEC LA DESCRIPTION DE SES ANTIQUITES. Amsterdam, 1767. 2 parts in one vol. Plate 5 is of the Maison Carrée. Jefferson sold his copy to Congress: Sowerby 3886. [58] MEINERT, FRIEDERICH. SCHONE LANDBAUKUNST. Leipzig, 1798. This was ordered by Jefferson for the University, but there is no record of the library's ever having received a copy. Jefferson sold his own copy to Congress: Sowerby 4224. The identification of the work is incomplete, since the LC copy has not survived, but see Jefferson's own queries concerning its "4 cahiers" under Sowerby 4222. [59] MIGNERON DE BROQUEVILLE. DESCRIPTION DU PONT DE BRIENNE, CONSTRUIT A BORDEAUX . . . Bordeaux, 1788? Jefferson's copy, bound with other works, was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4200. [60] MILIZIA, FRANCESCO. PRINCIPJ DI ARCHITETTURA CIVILE, EDIZ. RIVEDUTA DA GIOV.-BATT. CIPRIANI. Bassano, 1813. 3 vols. Jefferson's University order was presumably for this edition, the latest he could have known of, since he is not likely to have heard of the 1825 reprint, and would likely have preferred the 1813 edition to that of 1804. There is no record of the library's ever having received the set. But there was a copy of this edition in Jefferson's private library at the time of his death. It was sold as lot 720 in the 1829 sale. [61] MITCHELL, ROBERT. PLANS AND VIEWS IN PERSPECTIVE, WITH DESCRIPTIONS OF BUILDINGS ERECTED IN ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND; AND ALSO AN ESSAY, TO ELUCIDATE THE GRECIAN, ROMAN AND GOTHIC ARCHITECTURE. London, 1801. Text in English and French. Jefferson ordered it, but there is no record that the library ever acquired the book. Jefferson's copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4208. [62] MITFORD, WILLIAM. PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN IN ARCHITECTURE TRACED IN OBSERVATIONS ON BUILDINGS PRIMEVAL, EGYPTIAN, PHOENICIAN OR SYRIAN, GRECIAN, ROMAN. London, 1819. This was in Jefferson's private library at the time of his death, and was sold as lot 730 in the 1829 sale. The identification of the edition is Kimball's. [63] MONTFAUCON, BERNARD DE. ANTIQUITY EXPLAINED, AND REPRESENTED IN SCULPTURES. BY THE LEARNED FATHER MONTFAUCON. TRANSLATED INTO ENGLISH BY DAVID HUMPHREYS. London, 1721-22 and 1725. Of the ten volumes issued, the library lacks only the first. Jefferson, perhaps ignorant of the 1725 volume, ordered a 9-volume folio edition, but there is no record of any of the volumes having been received in Jefferson's lifetime. [64] NICHOLSON, PETER. THE CARPENTER'S AND JOINER'S ASSISTANT. London, 1797. The work was first published in 1792. This was the 2nd edition that Jefferson ordered in 1825 for the University, but there is no record of its ever having been received by the library. [65] NICHOLSON, PETER. CARPENTER'S NEW GUIDE. London, 1808. The library has the 11th edition of 1834. Jefferson in ordering this for the University did not specify in the way of edition anything more than "London," and there were London editions in 1792, 1797, 1801, 1805, and 1808 that he could have meant. There is no record of any edition having been recived by the library in Jefferson's lifetime. [66] NICHOLSON, PETER. THE PRINCIPLES OF ARCHITECTURE; CONTAINING THE FUNDAMENTAL RULES OF THE ART IN GEOMETRY, ARITHMETIC AND MENSURATION. London, 1809. 3 vols. Jefferson in ordering this for the University specified only a 3-volume edition in octavo, which could also have referred to the original edition of 1795-98. There is no record of either edition having been received by the library. [67] PALLADIO, ANDREA. ARCHITECTURE DE PALLADIO, CONTENANT LES CINQ ORDRES D'ARCHITECTURE, SUIVANT CET AUTEUR, SES OBSERVATIONS SUR LA MANIERE DE BIEN BATIR, &amp; SON TRAITE DES GRANDS CHEMINS &amp; DES PONTS, TANT DE CHARPENTE QUE DE MACONNERIE. Paris, 1764. See the entry under Jombert. The library has no French editions. [68] PALLADIO, ANDREA. THE ARCHITECTURE OF A. PALLADIO; IN FOUR BOOKS . . . REVIS'D, DESIGN'D, AND PUBLISH'D BY GIACOMO LEONI . . . THE 3D ED. COR. WITH NOTES AND REMARKS OF INIGO JONES . . . AND ALSO AN APPENDIX, CONTAINING THE ANTIQUITIES OF ROME. WRITTEN BY A. PALLADIO. AND A DISCOURSE OF THE FIRES OF THE ANCIENTS . . . London, 1742. This is one of the editions of Palladio that Jefferson sold to Congress: Sowerby 4174. It is the third Leoni edition. For notes on the two earlier editions, see the Appendix. [69] PALLADIO, ANDREA. I CINQUE ORDINI DELL' ARCHITETTURA. Rome, 1801. This was the quarto edition of Cipriani. It is known from the Kean list to have been in the library at a time when only Jefferson controlled the acquisitions. Later records of this volume (e.g., 1828 Catalogue entries on pages 105 and 108) make one wonder whether there were two copies of this edition in the library, or (if there was only one) whether it was given to Jefferson for the library by Joseph Coolidge or James Madison. [70] PALLADIO, ANDREA. LES QUATRE LIVRES DE L'ARCHITECTURE. Paris, 1650. This was the French translation of the Sieur de Chambrai. Jefferson sold a copy to Congress: Sowerby No. 4181. [71] PATTE, PIERRE. MONUMENS ERIGES EN FRANCE A LA GLOIRE DE LOUIS XV, PRECEDES D'UN TABLEAU DU PROGRESS DES ARTS &amp; DES SCIENCES SOUS CE REGNE. Paris, 1765. This was ordered by Jefferson for the University and received by the library, but the copy has not survived. Jefferson's own copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4211. [72] PERRAULT, CLAUDE. ORDONNANCE DES CINQ ESPECES DE COLONNES SELON LA METHODE DES ANCIENS. Paris, 1683. Ordered by Jefferson and received by the library, but the copy has not survived. [73] PERRAULT, CLAUDE. A TREATISE OF THE FIVE ORDERS OF COLUMNS IN ARCHITECTURE, VIZ., TOSCAN, DORIC, IONIC, CORINTHIAN AND COMPOSITE . . . TO WHICH IS ANNEX'D A DISCOURSE CONCERNING PILASTERS: AND OF SEVERAL ABUSES INTRODUCED INTO ARCHITECTURE . . . WRITTEN IN FRENCH BY CLAUDE PERRAULT . . . MADE ENGLISH BY JOHN JAMES. . . SECOND EDITION. London, 1722. This is the edition that Jefferson sold to Congress: Sowerby 4182. Kimball in identifying it misprinted 1708. [74] PERRIER, FRANCOIS. ILLMO. M. D. ROGERIO DU PLESSEIS . . . HEROI VIRTUTUM ET MAGNARUM ARTIUM EXIMIO CULTORI . . . SEGMENTA NOBILIUM SIGNORUM E STATUARUM. Rome, 1638-53. Jefferson ordered this for the University but there is no record of its ever having been received. His own copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4231. [75] PILKINGTON, MATTHEW. THE GENTLEMAN'S AND CONOISSEUR'S DICTIONARY OF PAINTERS . . . A NEW EDITION, WITH . . . ADDITIONS, AN APPENDIX, AND AN INDEX, BY H. FUSELI. London, 1810. Ordered by Jefferson for the University, but not supplied to the library. See the next entry. The library has the 1797 and 1857 editions. [76] PILKINGTON, MATTHEW. THE GENTLEMAN'S AND CONOISSEUR'S DICTIONARY OF PAINTERS. London, 1824. 2 vols. This was the edition revised and corrected by Watkins, and was the one supplied to Jefferson despite his order for the 1810 edition. See the preceding entry. It is worth noting that half a century later, in 1871, Lowndes was still saying that the 1810 edition was the "best." The set originally received has not survived. [77] PIRANESI, GIOVANNI BATTISTA. VEDUTE DI ROMA ANTICA ET MODERNA. Rome, 1748. The title given here, after Sowerby 4197, is something of a composite, which will surprise no one familiar with the bibliography of Piranesi. The restrikes from the Piranesi plates have been so numerous and so unsystematized that it is difficult to determine either what Jefferson was ordering for the University or what he himself bought for his private library. He recommended that the University get a single folio volume entitled "Vedute di Roma antica et moderna del Piranesi." The volume in his own library, later sold to Congress, was described in 1840 as a Rome, 1748, quarto edition with the (binder's?) title "Varie Vedute di Roma antica e Moderna," but the volume is not now known to be in existence, and thus escapes further analysis. It seems clear enough that Jefferson did not own the two folio volume edition of the late 1760's issued by Piranesi, the 127 plates of which were to make up vols. 16 and 17 of the 1800 collected restrike. [78] PIROLI, TOMMASO. ANTIQUITES D'HERCULANUM. Paris. 1804-05. 6 vols. The library lacks vols. 5-6. See the entry in the Appendix. [79] PLUMIER, CHARLES. L'ART DE TOURNER, OU DE FAIRE EN PERFECTION TOUTES SORTES D'OUVRAGES AU TOUR. Lyon, 1701. Jefferson sold his copy to Congress: Sowerby 1183. [80] PORTEFEUILLE DES ARTISTS, OU DESSINS DE CHATEAUX. Leipzig, 1800. See the entry under Stieglitz. [81] PRETI, FRANCESCO MARIA. ELEMENTI DI ARCHITETTURA. Venice, 1780. Jefferson's copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4202. [82] REPERTORY OF ARTS, MANUFACTURES, AND AGRICULTURE. London, 1794-1802. 16 vols. Jefferson's order called for 15 volumes only, so he was apparently thinking only of the first series or else was ignorant of the fact that the journal ran much longer. As a result of the original order, the University actually bought more than the 16 volumes in its first years of operation. Of the first series, the library now has only a mutilated copy of the fourth volume. [83] ROLAND LE VIRLOYS, CHARLES FRANCOIS. DICTIONNAIRE. D'ARCHITECTURE, CIVILE, MILITAIRE ET NAVALE, ANTIQUE, ANCIENNE ET MODERNE, ET DE TOUS LES ARTS ET METIERS QUI EN DEPENDENT. Paris, 1770-71. 3 vols. Jefferson's copy, bound in 2 vols., was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4206. [84] RONDELET, JEAN BAPTISTE. TRAITE THEORIQUE ET PRACTIQUE DE L'ART DE BATIR. Paris, 1812-17. 8 vols. Ordered by Jefferson for the University, but there is no record of its ever having been received. [85] ROSSI, FILIPPO DE. RITRATTO DI ROMA ANTICA, NEL QUALE SONO FIGURATI I PRINCIPALI TEMPIJ, THEATRI, ANFITEATRI, CERCHI, NAUMACHIE, ARCHI TRIONFALI, CURIE, BASILICHE, COLONNE, ORDINE DEL TRIONFO, DIGNITA MILITARI, E CIVILE, RITI, CERIMONIE, &amp; ALTRE COSE NOTABILI. Rome, 1654. Jefferson ordered it for the University, but there is no record of the library's having acquired it. Jefferson's own copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4192, q.v. for a comment on Kimball's effort to redate it 1645. [86] ROSSI, FILIPPO DE. RITRATTO DI ROMA MODERNA, NEL QUALE SONO EFFIGIATI CHIESE, CORPI SANTI, RELIQUIE, INDULGENZE, MONASTERIJ, HOSPEDALE, ORATORIJ, COMPAGNIE DE' SECOLARI, COLEGIJ . . . &amp; ALTRE COSE NOTABILI. Rome, 1652. Jefferson ordered it for the University, but there is no record of the library's having acquired it. Jefferson's own copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4193. [87] SANVITALE, FEDERIGO. ELEMENTI DI ARCHITETTURA CIVILE. Brescia, 1765. Jefferson's copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4201. [87a] SCAMOZZI, VICENZO. LES CINQ ORDRES D'ARCHITECTURE DE VINCENT SCAMOZZI . . . TIREZ DU SIXIEME LIVRE DE SON IDEE GENERALE D'ARCHITECTURE; AVEC LES PLANCHES ORIGINALES. PAR AUGUSTIN CHARLES D'AVILER. Paris, 1685. A copy of this edition was sold by Jefferson to Congress: Sowerby 4178. [88] SCAMOZZI, VICENZO. DISCORSI SOPRA L'ANTICHITA DI ROMA. Venice, 1582. This was the edition of Girolamo Porro. Jefferson ordered it for the University, but there is no record of the library's having acquired it. Jefferson's own copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4194. [89] SCAMOZZI, VICENZO. THE MIRROR OF ARCHITECTURE: OR, THE GROUND-RULES OF THE ART OF BUILDING. EXACTLY LAID DOWN BY VINCENT SCAMOZZI . . . WITH THE DESCRIPTION AND USE OF A JOINT RULE . . . BY JOHN BROWN. THE 7TH ED. WHEREUNTO IS ADDED A COMPENDIUM OF THE ART OF BUILDING . . . BY WILLIAM LEYBUBN. London, 1734. The curious spelling "Leybubn" is a misprint for Leybourn. Jefferson sold a copy of this edition to Congress: Sowerby 4179. [90] SCAMOZZI, VICENZO. OEUVRES D'ARCHITECTURE. Paris, 1764. See the entry under Jombert. [91] SERLIO, SEBASTIANO. IL SETTIMO LIBRO D'ARCHITETTURA DI SEBASTIANO SERGLIO, NEL QUAL SI TRATTA DI MOLTI ACCIDENTI, CHE POSSANO OCCORRER' AL ARCHITETTO. Frankfurt am Main, 1575. Text in Italian and Latin. Jefferson sold his copy to Congress: Sowerby 4176. [92] SMEATON, JOHN. A NARRATIVE OF THE BUILDING AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE EDYSTONE LIGHTHOUSE WITH STONE: TO WHICH IS SUBJOINED, AN APPENDIX, GIVING SOME ACCOUNT OF THE LIGHTHOUSE ON THE SPURN POINT, BUILT UPON A SAND. London, 1791. Jefferson's copy (See the following entry) was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4213. Of Smeaton's works, the library has only his Reports, 1812, and Miscellaneous Papers, 1814. [93] SMEATON, JOHN. A NARRATIVE OF THE BUILDING AND A DESCRIPTION OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE EDYSTONE LIGHTHOUSE. London, 1813. Jefferson himself owned the 1791 edition (See the preceding entry), so perhaps it was that edition he was ordering for the University even after the library had acquired the 1813 edition, though he is presumed to have been a party to the acquisition of the 1813 edition and may simply have forgotten that the title had already been acquired. The identification of the Kean entry of 1825 with the 1813 edition seems likely from the 1828 Catalogue annotation. [94] SOCIETY FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE, London. THE REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE FOR CONDUCTING THE EXPERIMENTS OF THE SOCIETY. London, 1800? Jefferson ordered a copy for the University, but there is no record of the library's ever having received a copy. [95] STIEGLITZ, CHRISTIAN LUDWIG. PLANS ET DESSINS TIRES DE LA BELLE ARCHITECTURE. Leipzig, 1800. Jefferson's description ("Portefeuille des artists, ou dessins de chateaux etc." one volume, quarto, "Leips. 1800") leaves some ground for doubt about the identification of this volume, and the library has only a German translation of 1805 of the Stieglitz work, acquired in modern times. That Jefferson made his desideratum note from a recollection of the copy he had sold to Congress seems certain, but the LC copy has not survived, Hilliard never found a copy for the University, and Miss Sowerby (No. 4222) despaired of identifying the book. [96] STOW: A DESCRIPTION OF THE MAGNIFICENT HOUSE AND GARDENS OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE GEORGE GREENVILLE NUGENT TEMPLE . . . A NEW EDITION . . . Buckingham, B. Seeley, etc., 1783. In 1825 Jefferson ordered only a single octavo volume. Under this specification the University acquired the 1797 edition described in the Appendix. The 1783 edition described here, however, is the one that Jefferson sold to Congress: Sowerby 4229. [97] TREDGOLD, THOMAS. ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF CARPENTRY. London and Oxford, 1820. Ordered by Jefferson for the University, but there is no record that it was ever received. The library has only later editions. [98] VASARI, GIORGIO. LE VITE DE' PIU ECCELLENTI PITTORI, SCULTORI, ET ARCHITETTI. Bologna, 1648-1663. 3 vols. This is both the edition ordered by Jefferson for the University and the edition that Jefferson sold to Congress: Sowerby 4240. The library has only modern editions of this classic, and there is no record of the original order's having been filled. [99] VIGNOLA, GIACOMO BAROZZIO, CALLED VIGNOLA. REGLES DES CINQ ORDERS D'ARCHITECTURE. Paris, 1764. See the entry under Jombert. The library has only a French edition of 1786 and what appears to be a sophisticated copy of the first edition of Venice 1563. [100] VIGNOLA, GIACOMO BAROZZIO, CALLED VIGNOLA. REGOLA DELI CINQUE ORDINI D'ARCHITETTURA . . . CON LA NUOVA AGGIONTA DI M. A. BUONAROTI. Amsterdam, 1619. This is the edition of Vignola that Jefferson sold to Congress: Sowerby 4177. [101] VISCONTI, ENNIO QUIRINO. A LETTER FROM THE CHEVALIER CANOVA TO THE EARL OF ELGIN. London, 1816. Ordered by Jefferson for the University, and in the library by 1828, but the copy has not survived. [102] VITRUVIUS POLLIO. ABREGE DES DIX LIVRES DE L'ARCHITECTURE DE VITRUVE, PAR PERRAULT. Paris, 1674, or Amsterdam, 1682. A copy of one of these two editions was in Jefferson's private library at the time of his death and was sold as lot 722 in the 1829 sale. Kimball identifies it as the Paris 1674 edition, but there is nothing in the sale catalogue to indicate which of the duodecimo editions it actually was. [103] VITRUVIUS POLLIO. LES DIX LIVRES D'ARCHITECTURE DE VITRUVE, CORRIGEZ ET TRADUITS NOUVELLEMENT EN FRANCOIS, AVEC DES NOTES &amp; DES FIGURES. SECONDE EDITION . . . PAR M. PERRAULT. Paris, 1684.

The library has Ware's Designs of Inigo Jones of 1735? which the DNB calls the first edition of this work, though Kimball calls the 1767 edition the second rather than the third. In any case, the copy Jefferson ordered for the library can be identified as either the 1756 or the 1757 edition from the title, though there is no record of the library's ever having received it. There was, however, a copy of one of these two editions in Jefferson's private library at the time of his death, and it was sold as lot 721 in the 1829 sale. [106] WHATELY, THOMAS.

Jefferson did not specify to Hilliard which edition of this book he wanted for the University, but this is the one Hilliard supplied him with, though the copy has not survived. It is perhaps also this edition that was in Jefferson's private library at the time of his death and was sold as lot 727 in the 1829 sale. [108] WINCKELMANN, JOHANN JOACHIM.

      <field name="fulltext">Jefferson Procures A Library On the Fine Arts In the minute book of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia under the date of October 15, 1825, Thomas Jefferson recorded in his own hand the resolution "that the board approves of the advance of 18,000. Dollars to William Hilliard, agent for procuring the library."1. 1. Constance E Thurlow &amp; Francis L Berkeley, Jr., The Jefferson Papers of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Va., 1950, Item 1517. A letter of May 22, 1825, from Jefferson to Hilliard, shows that this approval was made after the money had been deposited to Hilliard's account: "our money is deposited in the Virginia and Farmer's banks at Richmond and our Bursar will write by the next mail (of the 25th) to have the sum of 18,000 D. immediately deposited to your credit in the bank of the U. S. at Philadelphia. I have added 3000. D. to the 15. M. originally agreed upon. Further than this our funds do not admit us to go at present with convenience, and moreover I confidently expect that that sum may cover the whole purchase."2. 2. Elizabeth Cometti, Jefferson's Ideas on a University Library, Charlottesville, Va., 1950, p 22. Some of Jefferson's abbreviations have been expanded in quotations from this and other sources. This $18,000 was a portion of the $50,000 received from the "central government"3. 3. Thurlow &amp; Berkeley, Jefferson Papers, op cit., Item 1517. as a part compensation to the Commonwealth of Virginia for its advances during the War of 1812.4. 4. Philip Alexander Bruce, History of the University of Virginia, N. Y., 1920, Vol 2, p 38-40. As early as 1820 Jefferson was dealing with budgetary matters concerning the purchase of books, for in that year he proposed uses for hypothetical revenues of $15,000 and $30,000 a year. For the first he included an item "Books, say 150. vols. a year @ 10.D.—1,500" or ten per cent of the total budget, while for the second he asks for "Books, suppose 600. vols. a year @ 10.D.—6,000"5. 5. Thurlow &amp; Berkeley, Jefferson Papers, op cit., Item 1832. or twenty per cent of the total budget. Before the University opened its doors in 1825, Jefferson had spent what must have been a happy time compiling a catalogue of books for the proposed library. Although he had some help, notably from Bishop James Madison for the section on theology,6. 6. Bruce, History of the University, op cit., Vol.2, p.40. when he worked with the list for architecture, gardening, painting, sculpture, and music he was on firm ground, since he himself had owned one of the largest such fine arts collections in the country. Even after his library had been sold to Congress in 1815, he started reassembling this fine arts collection to include what was for the time a respectable number of architectural books. Fifty books on architecture alone were sold in 1815, while at least six and possibly five others on the same subject were in Jefferson's library at his death.7. 7. Fiske Kimball, Thomas Jefferson, Architect, Boston, 1916, p.90-101. Comparable libraries in the United States usually contained fewer such books. Samuel McIntire had seven works on architecture at his death in 1811.8. 8. Fiske Kimball, Mr. Samuel McIntire, Carver, Architect of Salem, Portland, Me., 1940, p.23. Charles Bulfinch had in his possession about fifteen architectural books until his death in 1844.9. 9. Charles A. Place, Charles Bulfinch, Architect and Citizen, Boston, 1925, p.285-6. William Byrd's library at Westover showed some twenty-seven architectural entries when it was offered for sale in 1777.10. 10.

Carpenter's Company of the City and County of Philadelphia, Finding List of the Library, Philadelphia, 1894. Some version of Palladio was the most commonly owned architectural book, both by gentlemen as well as by those more actively engaged in building. Joseph Coolidge presented a Palladio to the young University, as did James Madison, its second Rector.12. 12. A Catalogue of the Library of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, 1828. There is also a letter from a master carpenter mentioning his own copy of Palladio and telling how it differed from Jefferson's edition.13. 13. Thurlow &amp; Berkeley, Jefferson Papers, op cit., Item 1703: James Oldham to Thomas Jefferson, June 21, 1819: "J. Oldham sends Mr. Jefferson the Draughts of the window frames for his examination. The Dorick of Diocletions baths, Chambray, is not in the Book of Palladio which I have, and I must aske the faver of Mr. Jefferson to lone me the book to lay down my cornice and I will immediately return it safe. . ." See also Items 1733 and 1863, in one of which Jefferson specified certain entablatures by the numbers of specific plates in his copy of Palladio. In the library of the University of Virginia there is a manuscript copy of Jefferson's want list of books. It is labelled "President Jefferson's Catalogue of Books For the University of Virginia Library. 1825."14. 14. Thurlow &amp; Berkeley, Jefferson Papers, op cit., Item 2109. Written in what is probably the hand of Nicholas Trist, it is endorsed by Jefferson as follows: "The preceeding catalogue is that of the books with the purchase of which Mr. Wm. Hilliard is charged on behalf of the University of Virginia. Th: Jefferson Rector June 3. 1825." It is arranged in the order Jefferson had devised for his own library. This method divided knowledge into the three faculties of Memory, Reason, and Imagination, subtitled respectively History, Philosophy, and Fine Arts. These are further sub-divided into a total of forty-two headings, of which several contain books in the fields of building and the fine arts. Such books are found under "Hist-Civil-Ancient," "Technical Arts" (a subdivision of History, Civil), "Architecture" (a sub-division of Fine Arts), "Gardening. Painting. Sculpture. Music" (also a sub-division of Fine Arts), and "Polygraphical," a section which fell outside the three main divisions. F. W. Page, a former librarian of the University of Virginia, described an earlier want list, evidently in Jefferson's own hand: We have a manuscript volume, without date, but evidently prepared by him between the years 1820 and 1825, which he styles A Catalogue of Books Forming the Body of a Library for the University of Virginia, prefaced by an explanation of the views on which it is based, and by his classification into forty-two chapters, embracing 6,860 volumes, estimated to cost $24,076.50. A Catalogue of Books Forming the Body of a Library for the University of Virginia, to be afterwards enlarged by annual additions—An explanation of the Views on which this Catalogue has been Prepared. 1. Great standard works of established reputation, too voluminous and too expensive for private libraries, should have a place in every public library, for the free resort of individuals. 2. Not merely the best books in their respective branches of science should be selected, but such also as were deemed good in their day, and which consequently furnish a history of the advance of the science. 3. The opera omnia of writers on various subjects are sometimes placed in that chapter of this Catalogue to which their principal work belongs, and sometimes referred to the Polygraphical chapter. 4. In some cases, besides the opera omnia, a detached tract has been also placed in its proper chapter, on account of editorial or other merit. 5. Books in very rare languages are considered here as specimens of language only, and are placed in the chapter of Philology, without regard to their subject. 6. Of the classical authors, several editions are often set down on account of some peculiar merit in each. 7. Translations are occasionally noted, on account of their peculiar merit or of difficulties of their originals. 8. Indifferent books are sometimes inserted, because none good are known on the same subject. 9. Nothing of mere amusement should lumber a public library. 10. The 8vo. form is generally preferred, for the convenience with which it is handled, and the compactness and symmetry of arrangement on the shelves of the library.15. 15. Practically the same rule is in Jefferson's letter to Hilliard of September 16, 1825. See Cometti, Jefferson's Ideas on a University Library, op cit., p 34. 11. Some chapters are defective for want of a more familiar knowledge of their subject in the compiler, others from schisms in the science they relate to. In Medicine, e. g., the changes of theory which have successfully prevailed, from the age of Hippocrates to the present day, have produced distinct schools, acting on different hypotheses, and headed by respected names, such as Stahl, Boerhaave, Sydenham, Hoffman, Cudden, and our own good Dr. Rush, whose depletive and mercurial systems have formed a school, or perhaps revived that which arose on Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood. In Religion, divided as it is into multifarious creeds, differing in their bases, and more or less in their superstructure, such moral works have been chiefly selected as may be approved by all, omitting what is controversial and merely sectarian. Metaphysics have been incorporated with Ethics, and little extension given to them. For, while some attention may be usefully bestowed on the operations of thought, prolonged investigations of a faculty unamenable to the test of our senses, is an expense of time too unprofitable to be worthy of indulgence. Geology, too, has been merged in Mineralogy, which may properly embrace what is useful in this science, that is to say, a knowledge of the general stratification, collection and sequence of the different species of rocks and other mineral substances, while it takes no cognisance of theories for the self-generation of the universe, or the particular revolutions of our own globe by the agency of water, fire, or other agent, subordinate to the fiat of the Creator.16. 16. F. W. Page, "Our Library," dated Sept. 10, 1895, in Alumni Bulletin of the University of Virginia, Vol 2, No 3, November 1895, p.79. The manuscript described by Page has disappeared, presumably as a result of the disastrous library fire of 1895,17. 17. A Catalogue of the Library of the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, 1828; 1945 facsimile edition of W. H. Peden, p.2. but Jefferson's signed endorsement of the existing manuscript catalogue and his mentioning it in a letter of June 3, 1825 to Hilliard ("The copying of our Catalogue was finished yesterday, and I now inclose it")18. 18. Thurlow &amp; Berkeley, Jefferson Papers, op cit., Item 2189. attest its closeness to his original selections for the library of the new University. Bruce states that "All the volumes [in Jefferson's catalogue] descriptive of architecture, sculpture, painting, and music were written in Italian."19. 19. Bruce, History of the University of Virginia, op cit., Vol.2, p.188. That this was incorrect is seen when one examines the list itself or considers this passage in a letter from Jefferson to Hilliard dated November 4, 1825: ". . . in foreign books a strong regard to the edition named except where a newer and obviously better has been published, and a discretionary latitude as to recent editions of English books, and in no case a translation unless expressly specified. In general I wrote the title in the language described, but where I did not understand the language, I was not always exact in doing that, but the face of the catalogue shows that originals in all languages are what we want."20. 20. Thurlow &amp; Berkeley, Jefferson Papers, op cit., Item 2255. As we have seen, Jefferson also preferred the octavo size,21. 21. See footnote 15. but in the field of the fine arts a great variety of sizes had to be purchased. The fine arts list from the existing manuscript catalogue follows. The initials to the left of the titles refer to the country (A for America, F for France, G for Germany. England appears as L for London) in which the books could best be purchased; the first column of figures to the right indicates the number of volumes; and the second column of figures to the right indicates the format (folio, octavo, quarto, duodecimo). Sometimes the date and the place of imprint are also included. The bracketed numbers refer to the desiderata list beginning on page 7. A bracketed asterisk indicates that the University now owns the volume and that it is listed in the Appendix.

A dozen of the volumes were duodecimo, eighty-some were octavo, about fifty were quarto, forty-some folio, and a few did not have their sizes indicated. We have two ways of saying which of the books ordered by Jefferson were actually acquired in Jefferson's lifetime: one source is a manuscript catalogue of the library compiled even before the Hilliard list was completed, and the other is a printed catalogue that was to appear within two years after Jefferson's death. The slight manuscript list, "Catalogue of the Library of the University of Virginia" by John V. Kean, was dated May 16, 1825, and was thus completed some two months after the University had opened its doors and before any books recommended by the faculty could have been added to the collection. It provides eleven relevant titles: CHAPTER 14. TECHNICAL ARTS Smeaton's Eddystone lighthouse. grand format. [94] CHAPTER 18. GEOMETRY Cresswell's Linear Perspective. 8vo. [*] Atwood on Arches. 4to.

Many if not all of the books on the manuscript want list were already known to Jefferson. His own library, either before or after the sale to the Library of Congress, or both, contained at least thirty-seven of the architectural titles that also appeared in the catalogue sent to Hilliard,25. 25. Kimball, Thomas Jefferson Architect, op cit., p 90-101. But See also footnotes 29 and 30. and these have frequently helped to identify the editions Jefferson must have had in mind for the University. To reconstruct the fine arts library as it was proposed in the catalogue sent to Hilliard is thus not as difficult a task as it first appeared. Such a reconstruction was begun by the late Mr. E. S. Campbell, Chairman of the School of Art and Architecture from 1927 until his death in 1950. Mr. Campbell had purchased a dozen titles as they became available and as funds permitted. Since his death, another dozen items have been acquired. Thus, with titles surviving from Jefferson's original purchase and with replacements, the University of Virginia is today already numerically in as strong a position as it was in 1828 toward establishing the collection in the fine arts that Jefferson proposed, but it still lacks many titles of the ones originally ordered. When the seventy titles (more or less) needed to complete Jefferson's original order for the University are added to the collection, it will be a much smaller step to complete a reconstruction of Jefferson's personal architectural library. Of the books listed by Kimball26. 26. Kimball, Thomas Jefferson, Architect, op cit., p.90-101. the library already owns a few, including two of the Palladios. In addition, the library also has a copy of a Palladio not listed by Kimball, the Leoni edition of 1721, which Jefferson used in building the University,27. 27. Thurlow &amp; Berkeley, Jefferson Papers, op cit., Item 1863: Specifications for capitals in which Jefferson refers to specific plates in this edition of Palladio. though it is uncertain whether the copy used by Jefferson was his personal property.28. 28. John V. Kean, Catalogue of the Library of the University of Virginia, a manuscript dated May 16, 1825, lists a Leoni edition of Palladio and adds the marginal note: "(at Monticello)". Thus the book appears to have been the property of the University on this date, but whether it had been purchased by the University or given to the University by Jefferson is uncertain. When Miss Sowerby completes her excellent work on Jefferson's books, it will be easier to complete a reconstruction of the entire section on the fine arts in the personal library, an important step since Jefferson clearly had in mind from time to time that these books were to form a posthumous supplement to the University's holdings. Meanwhile, however, there are still thirty-some architectural books known to be lacking when the titles in the personal library are used as a source. These titles have, therefore, been added to the list of desiderata.29. 29. Which titles have been so supplied will be apparent from the annotations to the lists themselves A word on the sources of information concerning Jefferson's personal libraries, however, is in order. Kimball, Thomas Jefferson, Architect, op cit., p 90-101, was the pioneer effort at listing the architectural books in all of Jefferson's private libraries. Some additions and a few corrections are made here to Kimball's listings. Other than manuscript lists, there were formerly available only three important printed sources of information on the library Jefferson sold to Congress: (1) Catalogue of the Library of the United States, Washington, 1815. (2) Catalogue of the Library of Congress, Washington, 1830. (3) Catalogue of the Library of Congress, in the Capitol of the United States of America, Washington, 1840. That these need to be used with caution may be evidenced by a single example. The 1840 Catalogue assigned to Jefferson's library the Congressional copy of Claude Leopold Genneté's Nouvelle Construction de Chiminées, Liege, 1760, which apparently, however, never did belong to Jefferson. Fortunately, the work of E. Millicent Sowerby, Catalogue of the Library of Thomas Jefferson, Washington, 1952- (four of the five volumes have been published as the present list goes to press), is in process of superceding the earlier and less reliable printed catalogues For the last of Jefferson's libraries, no such similar study exists, and recourse still has to be made to the sale catalogue: Catalogue. President Jefferson's Library . . . By Nathaniel P. Poor . . . Washington, 1829, 14 p. A facsimile of this was issued by the Clements Library in 1944 without annotation. One fact needs to be emphasized here. The present lists have been made up of fine arts items culled from the list prepared by Jefferson for the University, and they have been supplemented by architectural30. 30. Kimball's implicit definition of an architectural book has in general been followed in the present listing (thus the omission from the present lists, for example, of books in the private library on gems), but the boundary line between an architectural book and one on engineering or mathematics is sometimes shadowy. Books on surveying have generally been included, but otherwise the books on applied mathematics have generally been excluded. Books on shipbuilding have been omitted, with two exceptions which have been included arbitrarily as a concession to titles containing the word "Architecture." Books on dykes, bridges, and fortifications have been omitted as being more strictly of an engineering nature The selection of architecturally important books from Jefferson's headings of "Geography," "History," and the like, has been peculiarly difficult Not many additions, however, will in the future be made in the field of Jefferson's interests in Roman antiquities In a slightly different category, Maucomble's Histoire Abrégée de la Ville de Nîmes obviously needed to be added to former lists, and has been added here, but perhaps others will want to make further additions to the northern European group In American architecture, only William Birch's City of Philadelphia has been added to correct a formerly conspicuous omission, and it seems doubtful that much else could conceivably be added in this field without embracing the problem of isolated plates in otherwise largely irrelevant books. books from Jefferson's private libraries. The anomalous position of music in this treatment will be immediately apparent. The architectural books were strongly represented in the public collection, less strongly in the private one. The reverse was true of the music books. The listing of Jefferson's musical library interests, therefore, awaits a different and separate study, as does the listing of his books on painting, sculpture, and the fine arts generally. When it is remembered, however, that Jefferson's architectural achievements are second only to his political contributions to the history of the United States, the importance of the group of books dealt with here can be appreciated. Without these books it is impossible to understand fully either Jefferson's philosophy of architecture or his sources for the visual forms with which he gave objective life to that philosophy.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Appendix A list of books now in the University of Virginia Library, remaining from, or replacing, books from the original fine arts collection assembled by Thomas Jefferson, or duplicating books from Jefferson's private architectural collec.tions ADAM, ALEXANDER. ROMAN ANTIQUITIES. New York, 1819. Jefferson ordered this for the University, but there is no record of its having been received. The library now has Jefferson's copy, acquired in recent years by the McGregor Library. *A1819.A332. ADAM, ROBERT. RUINS OF THE PALACE OF THE EMPEROR DIOCLETIAN AT SPALATRO IN DALMATIA. London, 1764. Ordered by Jefferson for the University, but there is no record of its having been received in Jefferson's lifetime. (A) NA320.A3.1764. ALDRICH, HENRY. THE ELEMENTS OF CIVIL ARCHITECTURE, ACCORDING TO VITRUVIUS AND OTHER ANCIENTS, AND THE MOST APPROVED PRACTICE OF MODERN AUTHORS, ESPECIALLY PALLADIO. . . TRANSLATED BY THE REV. PHILIP SMYTH. . . SECOND EDITION. Oxford, 1818. The copy of this book presented by Joseph Coolidge to Jefferson for the library was replaced in the 19th century with one inscribed on the leaf following the title page: University Library, June 1840, John Beaford, London." *NA2515.A4.1818. ATWOOD, GEORGE. A DISSERTATION ON THE CONSTRUCTION AND PROPERTIES OF ARCHES. London, 1801. The copy now in the library, and, so far as can be determined, the copy received by Jefferson for the University, lacked the 1804 Supplement. (E) TG327.A88. BALDINUCCI, FILIPPO. OPERE. Milan, 1808-1812. 14 vols. This is a set that was already in the library in the Spring of 1825 when Jefferson was making up his want list. *N27.B2.1808. BUILDER'S DICTIONARY: OR, GENTLEMAN AND ARCHITECT'S COMPANION. London, 1734. 2 vols. Though not directly associated with Jefferson, the library's copy is from the books of Joseph C. Cabell, and is thus intimately associated with the beginnings of the University. Jefferson not only ordered this book for the University, he also sold a copy to Congress: Sowerby 4187. *NA31.B82.1734. BURNEY, CHARLES. THE PRESENT STATE OF MUSIC IN FRANCE AND ITALY. London, 1771; and 2D ED., COR. London, 1773. Jefferson ordered the work for the University without specifying the edition, and, as with the following item, neither edition was received, though it may be presumed that he would have preferred that of 1773. Nevertheless, it was a copy of the 1771 edition that he sold to Congress: Sowerby 4253. The library's present copies of these two editions are from the Mackay-Smith Collection. *ML195.B96.1771 &amp; 1773. BURNEY, CHARLES. THE PRESENT STATE OF MUSIC IN GERMANY, THE NETHERLANDS, AND UNITED PROVINCES . . . 2D ED., COR. London, 1775. 2 vols. Jefferson ordered the work for the University without specifying the edition, though his general instructions to Hilliard would certainly have produced the corrected edition if they had produced either. No copy of this, however, is known to have been acquired in Jefferson's lifetime. The copy Jefferson sold Congress was the 1773 edition: Sowerby 4254. The library's present copy of the 1775 edition is from the Mackay-Smith Collection. *ML195.B963.1775. CHARNOCK, JOHN. HISTORY OF MARINE ARCHITECTURE. London, 1801-2. 3 vols. The set ordered by Jefferson for the University is still in the library, though it now lacks a frontispiece. *VM15.C48.1801. CHIPPENDALE, THOMAS. THE GENTLEMAN AND CABINET-MAKER'S DIRECTOR. . . THE SECOND EDITION. London, 1755. The library copy was the gift of the Class of 1952. It duplicates the copy Jefferson sold to Congress (Sowerby 4221), which Kimball incorrectly called the "3d". *NK.2542.C5A3. CLERISSEAU, CHARLES LOUIS. ANTIQUITES DE LA FRANCE. Paris, 1778. The half-title of the "Première Partie" (which is all that ever appeared) is "Monumens de Nismes." This edition was printed by P. D. Pierres, who a few years later was to print the first edition of Jefferson's Notes on Virginia. Jefferson ordered this book for the University, but there is no record that it was acquired in his lifetime. His own copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4209. (A)NA335.N5C6.1778. CRESSWELL, DANIEL. THE ELEMENTS OF LINEAR PERSPECTIVE, DESIGNED FOR THE USE OF STUDENTS IN THE UNIVERSITY. Cambridge, 1811. The volume is now bound with Cresswell's TREATISE ON SPHERICS, and there is evidence from the nature of the 1825 Kean entry and the 1828 printed entry that the binding was done between these years. *QA535.C7. CUTBUSH, JAMES. THE AMERICAN ARTIST'S MANUAL. Philadelphia, 1814. 2 vols. Jefferson ordered this, but there is no evidence that a copy was acquired before 1828. The library's present copy was the gift of A. C. Taylor. *T9.C95.1814. DEZALLIER D'ARGENTVILLE, ANTOINE JOSEPH. THEORY AND PRACTICE OF GARDENING. . . BY LESIEUR ALEXANDER LE BLOND. DONE FROM THE LATE EDITION PRINTED AT PARIS, BY JOHN JAMES. . . THE SECOND EDITION. London, 1728. The library's present copy duplicates the one Jefferson sold to Congress: Sowerby 4226. *SB461.D48. DOSSIE, ROBERT. THE HANDMAID TO THE ARTS. 2D ED. London, 1764. 2 vols. The library still owns the set acquired on Jefferson's order. The copy Jefferson sold to Congress was also this edition: Sowerby 1094. *TP144.D72.1764. FELIBIEN, ANDRE, SIEUR DES AVAUX ET DE JAVERCY. ENTRETIENS SUR LES VIES ET SUR LES OUVRAGES DES PLUS EXCELLENS PEINTURES ANCIENS ET MODERNS: AVEC LA VIE DES ARCHITECTES. Trevoux, 1775. 6 vols. Jefferson originally ordered for the University a 5-volume set in 12mo, thus indicating that he had the Amsterdam 1706 edition in mind: See the entry in the Desiderata list. What Hilliard bought for him was a 6-volume set, which is still in the library. *N27.F3.1725. GIBBS, JAMES. A BOOK OF ARCHITECTURE, CONTAINING DESIGNS OF BUILDINGS AND ORNAMENTS. London, 1728. Not only ordered by Jefferson for the University and actually received, but Jefferson also had a copy which he sold to Congress: Sowerby 4218. (A) NA2620.G5.1728. GIBSON, ROBERT. THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF SURVEYING . . . WITH . . . A NEW SET OF ACCURATE MATHEMATICAL TABLES. BY D. P. ADAMS. New York, 1811 or 1814. There was a copy in Jefferson's private library at the time of his death, but the 1829 sale catalogue (lot 413), except to show that it was one of the Adams editions, did not exactly identify the volume. Either of the ones now in the University library, as described above, could be a duplicate of the one Jefferson had. Furthermore, it was probably one of these editions Jefferson ordered for the University in 1825. For an earlier edition under another title, see the Desiderata list. *TA545.G4.1811 and 1814. GIBSON, ROBERT. THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF SURVEYING. New York, 1821. This edition has the tables of James Ryan. In ordering the book for the University, Jefferson did not specify the edition, but this is the one that was actually supplied, though neither of the copies now in the library is the one Jefferson bought for the University. *TA545.G4.1821. GROSE, FRANCIS. RULES FOR DRAWING CARICATURAS. London, 1791? See the entry under Hogarth. HEELY, JOSEPH. LETTERS ON THE BEAUTIES OF HAGLEY. London, 1777. 2 vols. Ordered by Jefferson, but there is no record that the library received a copy before 1828. The library now has only a poor copy of the first volume. See the description in the Desiderata list. DA660.H45. HOGARTH, WILLIAM. HOGARTH'S ANALYSIS OF BEAUTY. London, 1791? The library's copy is bound with Francis Grose's Rules for Drawing Caricaturas, is the copy purchased for the University on Jefferson's order, and is the one that the 1828 Catalogue dated 1776. *N70.H7. JONES, INIGO. THE DESIGNS OF INIGO JONES, CONSISTING OF PLANS AND ELEVATIONS FOR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE BUILDINGS. PUBLISHED BY WILLIAM KENT, WITH SOME ADDITIONAL DESIGNS. London, 1770. 2 vols. in one. This is the edition ordered by Jefferson for the University, and the one actually bought, but Jefferson's own copy which he sold to Congress (Sowerby 4217), was the less expensive edition of 1727. See the Desiderata list. (A) NA997.57K4.1770. KENNETT, BASIL. ROMAE ANTIQUA NOTITIA; OR; THE ANTIQUITIES OF ROME .Philadelphia, 1822. The library still owns the copy acquired on Jefferson's order. Jefferson's own copy, which he sold to Congress, was the 11th London edition of 1746: Sowerby 114. *DG76.K34.1822. LANDON, CHARLES PAUL. ANNALES DU MUSEE ET DE L'ECOLE MODERNE DES BEAUX-ARTS. Paris, 1800-09. 17 vols. and supplement (PAYSAGES ET TABLEAUX DE GENRE) 1805. 4 vols. Jefferson's order for 20 vols. shows that he was aware of the supplement. Hilliard apparently filled the order with a 17-volume set consisting of the supplement and volumes 4-16 of the main set. This is the 17-vol. set described in the 1828 Catalogue. It is still in the library, still lacking vol. 17 and the first three volumes. Jefferson himself owned and sold to Congress a 10-volume set, complete only for volumes issued to 1806: Sowerby 4244. *N2010.L3.1800. LE CLERC, SEBASTIEN. TRAITE D'ARCHITECTURE. Paris, 1714. 2 vols. The library still owns the copy acquired on Jefferson's order, which is in 2 volumes, not one as specified. The copy that Jefferson sold to Congress, however, had the 4 parts bound in one volume: Sowerby 4181. *NA2515.L46.1714. LE GRAND, AUGUSTIN. GALERIE DES ANTIQUES. Paris, 1803. Jefferson ordered it, and it was in the library by 1828. Jefferson's own copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby: 4243. (A) N2030.L5.1803. LEONARDO DA VINCI. A TREATISE ON PAINTING. London, 1721. Ordered by Jefferson for the University, but there is no record of its having been received. Jefferson's own copy was sold to Congress: Sowerby 4237. The present library copy is from the collection of T. W. Tottie. *ND1130.L6.1721. MAJOR, THOMAS. THE RUINS OF PAESTUM. London, 1768. Jefferson ordered it and it was received by 1828, but the copy has not survived. The library's present copy is from the collection of William Arthur, sixth Duke of Portland. *NA285.P3M2.1768. MARECHAL, PIERRE SYLVAIN. LES ANTIQUITES D'HERCULANUM, AVEC LES EXPLICATIONS. Paris, 1780-1803. 12 vols. This was the edition engraved by François Anne David, under whose name Brunet enters it, and though it was issued in both 4to and 8vo, there still remains some doubt as to whether this was the set Jefferson had in mind when he ordered a 7-volume 8vo set. One thing, however, is sure: that this set is what Jefferson got from his order, because the 1828 Catalogue acknowledges the presence of the 12-volume set. Of this, only the first nine volumes have survived. *DG70.H5M2.1780. MONTFAUCON, BERNARD DE. ANTIQUITY EXPLAINED. London, 1721-22 and 1725. Ordered by Jefferson, but there is no record that the set was received before 1828. The library lacks the first volume only. See the description in the Desiderata list. *DE57.- M79. MORRIS, ROBERT. SELECT ARCHITECTURE: BEING REGULAR DESIGNS OF PLANS AND ELEVATIONS WELL SUITED TO BOTH TOWN AND COUNTRY. London, 1755. The library's copy is a duplicate of the one Jefferson sold to Congress: Sowerby 4219. The University also has a copy of Morris's Lectures on Architecture, 1734. (A)NA7328.M6.1755. PALLADIO, ANDREA. THE ARCHITECTURE . . . REVIS'D, DESIGN'D, AND PUBLISH'D BY GIACOMO LEONI . . . London, 1715. 4 parts, generally bound in 2 vols. This was the first Leoni edition; the two following editions were also associated with Jefferson. This one was in the library Jefferson sold to Congress: Sowerby 4175. *NA2517.P3.1715. PALLADIO, ANDREA. THE ARCHITECTURE . . . REVIS'D, DESIGN'D, AND PUBLISH'D BY GIACOMO LEONI . . . SECOND EDITION. London, 1721. 2 vols. The copy now in the library was the gift of Thomas Nelson Page. The case for this having been the edition recorded by Kean as being in the University's collection in 1825, though physically the books were then "at Monticello," rests on the certainty that this was one of the editions used during the construction of the University. The volumes apparently never got back from Monticello because they do not appear in the 1828 printed catalogue. *NA2517.P3.1721. PALLADIO, ANDREA. THE FIRST BOOK OF ARCHITECTURE . . . WITH AN APPENDIX TOUCHING DOORS AND WINDOWS BY PR. LE MUET . . . TRANSLATED . . . BY GODFREY RICHARDS. London, 1700. That Jefferson owned a copy is clear from the annotation "Palladio's 1st book of architecture, with Le Muet on doors &amp; windows" in his manuscript library catalogue now at the Massachusetts Historical Society, but the copy apparently did not go to Congress in 1815, and there is no record of it in the 1829 sale catalogue. Which edition Jefferson owned is a matter, therefore, of speculation. Kimball, p.97-8, listed as possibilities the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 7th, and 12 editions (of 1663, 1668, 1676, 1708, and 1733 respectively, though he misprinted two of these dates). The edition now at the University, the gift of the Rev. Lee M. Dean, is as likely as any other, so far as is now known. *NA2517.P3.1700. PIROLI, TOMMASO. ANTIQUITES D'HERCULANUM, GRAVEES PAR TH. PIROLI, ET PUBLIEES PAR F. ET P. PIRANESI, FRERES. Paris, 1804-05. 6 vols. The library still has the first four of the six volumes acquired on Jefferson's original order. *DG70.H5P6.1804. POTTER, JOHN, ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY. ARCHAEOLOGIA GRAECA: OR, THE ANTIQUITIES OF GREECE . . . WITH A LIFE OF THE AUTHOR, BY ROBERT ANDERSON . . . AND A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE LIVES AND WRITINGS OF THE MOST CELEBRATED GREEK AUTHORS; BY GEORGE DUNBAR. Edinburgh, 1824. 2 vols. Ordered by Jefferson, this set was in the library by 1828, but the original copies have not survived. The library's present set was the gift of R. L. Harrison. DF76.P86.1824. REPERTORY OF ARTS, MANUFACTURES, AND AGRICULTURE. London, 1794-1802. 16 vols. The library has only the 4th volume. See the entry in the Desiderata list. T1.R4. RUMFORD, SIR BENJAMIN THOMPSON, COUNT. ESSAYS, POLITICAL, ECONOMICAL, AND PHILOSOPHICAL. Boston, 1798-1804. 3 vols. All three volumes were ordered by Jefferson for the library, but there is no evidence that they had been received by 1828. Jefferson himself owned the first two volumes (Sowerby 1182), and some of the chapters in this work had a notable influence on Jefferson as a practicing architect; e.g., Essay IV in Volume One (1798) OF CHIMNEY FIRE-PLACES, and ESSAY I in Volume Two (1799) OF THE MANAGEMENT OF FIRE, AND THE ECONOMY OF FUEL. In modern times, the library has acquired a set of the books. *Q113.R92.1798. SPENCE, JOSEPH. POLYMETIS. London, 1747. The library's present copy is the one ordered by Jefferson. The 1828 Catalogue entry indicating that the one Hilliard sent was an 1818 edition is an error, brought about by an accidental transfer of imprint from the preceding item. The copy Jefferson sold to Congress was also this edition: Sowerby 4230. *N5613.S7.1747. STOWE. A DESCRIPTION OF THE HOUSE AND GARDENS OF THE MOST NOBLE &amp; PUISSANT PRINCE, GEORGE-GRENVILLE-NUGENT-TEMPLE, MARQUIS OF BUCKINGHAM. London, 1797. Ordered by Jefferson and received by 1828. For a note on the 1783 edition, see the Desiderata list. (A) DA664.-S8.1797. STUART, JAMES. THE ANTIQUITIES OF ATHENS, MEASURED AND DELINEATED BY JAMES STUART . . . AND NICHOLAS REVETT. London, 1762-1830. 5 vols. Ordered by Jefferson, but there is no record that the library acquired a set before 1828. The library's present set was the gift of G. Harris. Jefferson accurately specified 4 volumes. The 5th appeared after his death. He himself owned another copy of the first volume, which he sold to Congress: Sowerby 4190. *NA280.S9.1762. TOULONGEON, FRANCOIS EMMANUEL. MANUEL DU MUSEUM FRANCAIS. Paris, 1802-08. 10 parts in 5 vols. The library still has the set acquired on Jefferson's order. Jefferson's own set, which he sold to Congress, was originally bound in four volumes and was later bound into three: Sowerby 4245. *N2030.T7.1802. WINCKELMANN, JOHANN JOACHIM. STORIA DELLE ARTI DEL DESIGNO PRESSO GLI ANTICHI, DI GIOVANNI WINKELMANN. TRADOTTA DAL TEDESCO E IN QUESTA EDIZIONE CORRETTA E AUMENTATA DALL ABATE CARLO FEA. Rome, 1783-86. 3 vols. This is clearly the edition Jefferson ordered for the University, but there is no record of its ever having been received. The library's present set was the gift of the Virginia State Library. Jefferson himself owned the 1779 edition. See the Desiderata list. (A) N5330.W77.1783. WOOD, ROBERT. THE RUINS OF BALBEC. London, 1757. Ordered by Jefferson and received by 1828, but the copy has not survived. Jefferson himself had another copy, which he sold to Congress: Sowerby 4188. The library's present copy was the gift of G. Harris. (A)NA335.B2W8.1757. WOOD, ROBERT. THE RUINS OF PALMYRA. London, 1753. Ordered by Jefferson and received by 1828, but the copy has not survived. The library's present copy was the gift of G. Harris. (A) NA335.P2W8.</field>
