Assistant in History JOSEPH METTAUER HURT, M. A. Assistant in Philosophy EUGENE PRICE BROWN Student Assistant in Chemistry RAYMOND CARLYLE DINGLEDINE, Student Assistant in Physics Required for Enrolment in the Department.âThe possession of a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank; or, in the case of a graduate of an institution of such rank that does not confer a baccalaureate degree, presentation of a certificate of graduation in a course of study accepted by the academic faculty as fully equivalent to that ordinarily required for the degree in question. A candidate fulfilling these conditions will be registered as a graduate student if he is pursuing one or more graduate courses. Should he desire not only to enter this department, but also to become a candidate for the Master's or Doctor's degree, he should promptly secure from the Registrar of the University a blank form of application, which, when properly filled out, should be mailed to the Dean of this department, together with a catalogue of the institution from which the candidate received his baccalaureate degree. In case that institution has (1) a faculty of at least six professors giving their full time to college or university work; if it has (2) entrance requirements equal to those of this university; and if it has (3) a course of four full years in liberal arts and sciences; such candidate will not be required to do any undergraduate work here except such as the Committee on Rules and Courses or the professors in charge may consider necessary for the successful prosecution of the graduate courses elected for the higher degree. If, however, the institution in question does not meet the three conditions mentioned above, such candidate will be considered individually by the Committee on Rules and Courses, which will note especially his deficiencies, for the purpose of prescribing such courses as will supply them. Graduate in a School. Any student who successfully completes all the courses offered in any academic school is entitled to a diploma of graduation in that school; but a student thus pursuing graduate studies will not be registered as a member of this department unless he has satisfied the conditions above stated. Master of Arts. The degree of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia will be conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts of this university who has completed the work in four fully organized graduate courses chosen by himself and approved by the academic faculty; each of which courses must be one in which the professor regularly meets the class not less than three hours a week. The four courses must be chosen from at least three distinct subjects distributed among three different academic schools, except by special order of the academic faculty; and three of the courses must be cognate, which means that they must be selected, for example, from such kindred groups of subjects as languages and literature, or mathematics and natural science, or history, economics and philosophy, or philosophy, education and biology, etc. Students who take such graduate courses in some subjects before receiving the B. A. degree will not be granted the M. A. degree unless they take at least two of their graduate courses in the academic year when the latter degree is conferred. Nor shall any student take the Master's degree until at least one year after the prerequisite Bachelor's degree has been conferred, except with the special consent of the Academic Faculty. A description of the courses open to candidates for the master's degree is given in its proper connection in that portion of the General Catalogue which treats of the work of the independent academic schools, pp. 123-167. None of these courses indicated by the letter "C" will be counted for the M. A. degree unless preceded by undergraduate work of "B" grade amounting to at least six session-hours in the same subject, or (in case only one three-session-hour course is offered in that subject) by one B course in that subject and another B course in the same Group (see p. 170 of the General Catalogue for 1912-1913); which B courses must be approved by the professor in charge of the "C" course in question. The courses indicated are also, in many cases, included among the advanced courses that may be offered as electives at large for the degree of Bachelor of Arts: credit can be obtained for any such course in but one of these capacities by the same candidate; work done for the lower degree being in no case counted again as part of the work required for the attainment of the higher degree. Master of Science. The degree of Master of Science of the University of Virginia will be conferred upon a holder of the cultural degree (p. 170 of the General Catalogue for 1912-1913) of Bachelor of Science, under regulations exactly similar to those under which the degree of Master of Arts is conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts. Candidates for the degree of Master of Science need therefore,âin order to see in detail what will be required of them,â merely substitute the letters "B. S." for "B. A.," and the letters "M. S." for "M. A.," wherever "B. A." and "M. A.," respectively occur in the statement (p. 6) of the requirements for the degree of Master of Arts. The degree of Master of Science will also be conferred upon the holder of the vocational degree of Bachelor of Science upon conditions similar to those required of the holder of the cultural degree; provided that the graduate courses pursued by the candidate shall be chiefly those in continuation of the principal subject of his work for the Bachelor's degree, and shall be chosen with the approval of the professor or professors concerned; and provided also that the name of this principal subject shall be inscribed upon his diploma. Doctor of Philosophy. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Virginia will be conferred upon the holder of the B. A. or cultural B. S. degree of this university, or (under the regulations mentioned below) upon the holder of a similar degree from some other chartered institution of learning who possesses a reading knowledge of French and German, and who completes the prescribed graduate work in three cognate subjects (see page 8), chosen by himself from at least two academic schools and approved by the academic faculty; this graduate work to be pursued for at least three years in the major subject, for at least two years in the primary minor, and for at least one year in the secondary minor subject. It is to be noted, however, that no "C" course can be counted for the Ph. D. degree unless preceded by undergraduate work of "B" grade amounting to at least six session-hours in the same subject, or (in case only one three-session-hour course is offered in that subject), by one "B" course in it and another B course in the same Group (see p. 170 of the General Catalogue for 1912-1913); which "B" courses must be approved by the professor in charge of the "C" course in question. It is also provided that any student taking the second or third year of graduate work in a subject may be required by the professor, with the approval of the academic faculty, to attend such lectures or courses in any of the academic schools as the professor may deem necessary. The "reading knowledge" of French and German mentioned above is intended to enable the candidate to pursue his chosen subjects through the medium of books and periodicals in the French and German languages. His ability to do this must be tested at the beginning of the first year of his candidacy by examinations on these languages in the presence of a committee consisting of the professor of the candidate's major subject and the professors of French and German. In case of failure on either or both of the examinations, he will be required to enter the appropriate class or classes in one or both of the languages, and will not be regarded as a regular candidate for the doctorate until he has fulfilled the requirements in French and German. It is provided, however, that any student who has already passed on courses B1 and B2 in either or both of the languages at this university shall be considered as having the requisite knowledge of either or both of them, as the case may be. Graduate work done in other universities may be accepted in lieu of resident work done here, provided sufficient evidence is furnished by examination, written or oral, or both, that such work has been of a grade similar to that required here, and has been satisfactorily performed, and provided also that, while it shall be possible for a candidate to get credit in this way for the whole of his secondary minor subject, every candidate must take here at least one advanced course in his primary minor, and at least one year's work in his major subject. It is also provided that a candidate who is a professor, in charge of the subject selected by him as major, in a chartered college or university, may be allowed by the academic faculty to spend only two years in resident work at this university. The graduate work of the last year of candidacy shall in all cases be done at this university, unless the academic faculty shall for special reasons direct otherwise. Upon the completion of the approved courses, the candidate shall submit to the academic faculty a dissertation exhibiting independent research in some branch of his major subject. The dissertation must be submitted not later than April 15 of the year in which the candidate applies for the degree. Moreover, the copy presented for the faculty's approval shall be written (type-written, if feasible) on paper of prescribed quality and size; shall be bound; and shall have certain prescribed phrases on the cover and title page. If accepted as satisfactory by the faculty, this copy shall immediately become the property of the university. If approved, the dissertation must be printed at the candidate's expense before the degree is conferred, and one hundred copies deposited in the library of the university; or, if this be impracticable on account of lack of time, the candidate must deposit with the Bursar a sum of money sufficient to have a hundred copies of the dissertation printed. The instruction open to candidates for the doctor's degree in each of the academic schools is described in a preceding portion of the catalogue. No graduate course can be counted for the doctor's degree unless the professor regularly meets the class not less than three hours a week. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses at the University for a Virginia student in the Department of Graduate Studies may be estimated at from $220 a year upward, according to the mode of living: for students from other states this minimum should be increased by a sum ranging from $90 to $130 for tuition fees. A fuller statement of expenses, including the conditions under which Virginia or other students are entitled to free tuition, will be found on pp. 102-103, of the General Catalogue for 1912-1913. Applicants for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy who are granted the privilege of non-residence during a portion of their candidacy, under conditions above stated, are required to matriculate and pay the annual university fee of $40 if not Virginians, and $10 if Virginians, during such period of non-residence. For days and hours of lectures and for dates of examinations in the Department of Graduate Studies, see schedule on next page.

Professor Fitz-Hugh, Adjunct Professor McLemore. Primarily for Graduates. Latin D1: Course C1 or Course C2 or the equivalent of either, prerequisite.âThis course extends through three years and is intended for those who desire to specialize for one, two, or three years in classical philology. It contemplates especially the needs of those who choose Latin as their major elective for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Roman civilization is the vital link between the Hellenic and the Romanic, and hence Latin philology, which is the science of Roman civilization, has vital points of contact with Greek philology on the one hand and with Romanic on the other. If the candidate's major elective be Latin, a respectable familiarity with Greek is required, since the language, literature, and life of the Romans are saturated with Greek influence. If the candidate's major elective be Romanic, the technical Greek requirement is waived as far as practically possible, and he is guided into the history of the Roman popular vernacular, the common source of the Romanic tongues, and into an acquaintance with the authors illustrating the Vulgar Latin in literature. Plan of Work.âIt is the aim of this course, as far as the teaching force and the resources of the School permit, to prepare the candidate to investigate independently the sources of our knowledge of the language, monuments (literary and objective), and life of the Romans. The following is therefore an outline of the course: I. In Language: Elements of comparative grammar (Giles supplemented by Hirt and Sommer on Sounds and Inflections and by Brugmann and Schmalz on Syntax)âintroduction to Latin historical grammar (Lindsay, supplemented by Landgraf)âsystematic grammar (KÃ¼hner) with stylistic exercises, oral and written, in conjunction with Cicero's De Oratoreâreading of epigraphic and literary monuments illustrating the history of the Latin Language. II. In the Literary and Objective Monuments of the Romans: Reading of authors in groups systematically planned to illustrate the literary life of the Romansâhistory and interpretation of texts âelements of palÃ¦ography (Johnson, supplemented by Thompson), epigraphy (Lindsay, supplemented by Egbert and Cagnat, numismatics (Gnecchi, supplemented by Hill), topography and remains (Platner, Peterson, Huelson, Mau, Strack, FurtwÃ¦ngler). III. In Roman Life: Constructive study of Roman culture-historyâreading of authors illustrating the development of Roman civilizationâstudy of modern authorities in Roman culture-history (Philippson, Nissen, Mommsen, Marquardt-Mommsen, Preller-Jordon, Springer-Michaelis and Winter, Schanz, Windelband). Friday, Saturday, 12-2. Cabell Hall. Professor Fitz-Hugh, Adjunct Professor McLemore.

In the discussion of the Ordinary Differential Equation particular attention is paid to the theory of integration of such equations as admit of a known Transformation Group, and the classic methods of integration are compared with those which flow from the Theory of Continuous Groups. A similar method is adopted in the study of the Linear Partial Differential Equation of the First Order. As far as the time admits, the theories of integration of the Complete System, as well as those of the General Partial Differential Equation of the First and Second Orders, will be discussed. Hours by appointment. Professor Page. [Only one of the courses D1 and D2 will be offered in 1913-14.] Mathematics D3: A Course in the Theory of Functions: Course C1 prerequisite.âIn this class is offered to advanced students a course in Mathematical Analysis. The treatment of the subject is arranged under three heads, as follows: The design of the numbers of analysis and the laws of the operations to which they are subject are studied after the methods of Dedekind and Tannery, Cantor and Weierstrass, as introductory to the study of functions. The study of the Theory of Functions of a Real Variable, including series, products, and continued fractions. The General Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable is studied after the methods of Cauchy, Riemann, and Weierstrass. A special study is made of the series of Taylor and of Fourier.

The lectures will give a general account of philosophical speculation from its beginnings among the Greeks to the present time. The endeavor will be made to present the various philosophical systems in their relation to the science and general civilization of the ages to which they belong, and to estimate their social and political significance. A large part of the year will be devoted to the theories and problems of modern times. Reading of texts and commentaries, lectures, discussions, and essays. Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 10-11. Rotunda, S. E. Professor Lefevre. Philosophy C2: Social Psychology.â(Open to students who have taken Courses B1, or B2, or B3, or their equivalents.) In this course, general psychological principles will be applied to the study of the social relations of the self, and the influences which determine feeling and action in the individual as a member of the group, e. g., the sentiments of religious, political, and social crowds. The attempt is made to approach social facts from the mental side. The study of social consciousness, as involved in the genesis and growth of social institutions; the psychology of education; the psychology of religion; and the evolution of social consciousness will engage the attention in this course. Reading of texts, lectures, discussions, and reports. Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday. Hours to be arranged. Rotunda, S. E. Mr. Diggs. Text-Books.âTo be announced. Primarily for Graduates. Philosophy D1.â(Open to students who have taken or are taking Course C1.) Empiricism and Rationalism. The empirical movement as represented by Locke, Hume, and Mill, and the rationalistic movement as represented especially by Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz, will be studied with reference to their distinctive methods. Reading of texts and commentaries, lectures, discussions, and essays. Professor Lefevre. Philosophy D2.â(Open to students who have taken or are taking Course C1.) The Critical Philosophy of Kant. The greater part of the year will be devoted to the careful study of the Critique of Pure Reason and the Critique of Practical Reason. Collateral reading of standard commentaries and of selected recent literature on the subject will be required. Special attention will be given to Kant's relation to previous philosophical systems, to the development of his own philosophy, and to the interrelation of his three Critiques. Reading of texts, lectures, discussions, and reports. Professor Lefevre. Further advanced work in Philosophy will be arranged in accordance with the needs of individual students. [Courses D1 and D2 will be given in alternate years.] SCHOOL OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Associate Professor Hoxton. Adjunct Professor Sparrow. Mr. Marshall. Mr. Dingledine. For Graduates and Undergraduates. Physics C1 and C2: Physics B1 and Mathematics B2 or the equivalent prerequisite.âEither of these courses may be a combination of two of the four subjects outlined below, each subject being pursued for one half of a year. The choice of subject in each case is determined by the purposes of the student, the approval of the professors concerned, and usually a sequence in time. Advanced laboratory exercises occupying six hours per week will be required. The character of this work may be varied to meet individual needs. The work of all these courses requires an elementary knowledge of the calculus. In order to attain this in the least passible time, the student desiring to specialize in Physics is advised to take up Mathematics A2 followed by Mathematics B3. Electricity and Magnetism. Elements of the mathematical theory with emphasis on electrical measurements. Modern ideas of electricity and matter will be introduced. Hours by appointment, first half-year. Associate Professor Hoxton. Optics. Development from a moderately advanced standpoint special attention being paid to the theory of modern optical instruments. Hours by appointment second half-year. Associate Professor Hoxton. Heat. Principles of thermometry, calorimetry, kinetic theory, etc., with special attention to the fundamentals of thermodynamics illustrated by applications to heat engines and to solutions. Hours by appointment, first half-year. Adjunct Professor Sparrow. Properties of Matter. Gravitation, elasticity, and the properties of liquids and gases, special emphasis being laid on the kinetic theory of matter. Hours by appointment, second half-year. Adjunct Professor Sparrow. A Laboratory Fee of five dollars is required for each of the three above courses. Physics D1 and D2: The work of these courses is of an advanced type, designed to bring the student into touch with modern methods of physical research. With this end in view the contents of the courses will be varied from year to year, ranging over the more important fields of physics in a cycle of about three years. The formal preparation necessary for these courses will vary somewhat with the nature of the subjects treated. What is necessary in a certain maturity of mind with reference to the subject. The student who has not had training in mathematics equivalent to Course C1 will probably be unable to follow with profit any D course dealing with the mathematical side of physics, while the student who has not had the equivalent of the corresponding C course in physics, will be unable to pursue a D course dealing with the experimental side. For the session of 1913-1914 courses will be offered in Thermodynamics and Kinetic Theory, and in General Dynamics. Hours by appointment. Associate Professor Hoxton, Adjunct Professor Sparrow.
