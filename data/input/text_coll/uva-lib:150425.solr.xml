      <field name="desc_meta_file_display">&lt;description type="note"&gt;The collection contains a bound manuscript journal Reminiscences of my Life and Work among the Freedmen of Charlottesville, Virginia, from March 1st 1866 to July 1st 1875. Vol. 1, together with a carte-de-visite portrait, n.d., of Carkin by Charlottesville photographer William Roads, and a copy of her certificate of commission as a teacher of ex-slaves issued by the Eastern Department of the American Freedmen's Aid Commission.&lt;/description&gt;</field>
      <field name="desc_meta_file_display">&lt;description type="note"&gt;In her reminiscences Carkin describes her arrival; the town of Charlottesville; military occupation; the University of Virginia and its students; Monticello; fellow teachers, particularly Anna Gardner, Isabella Gibbons and Paul Lewis; schoolhouses, schoolrooms, teaching duties, and students; entertainment; and travel, including a trip to Grant's inauguration and one to the Virginia constitutional convention of 1867-1868.&lt;/description&gt;</field>
      <field name="desc_meta_file_display">&lt;description type="note"&gt;She discusses the lives of the freedmen and their desire for an education; religious revivals; harassment of the school staff and the freedmen by townspeople and university students; celebrations and social events; trips to town by local mountaineers; and a Rivanna River flood in 1870. Aspects of local life different from New England are noted particularly in the purchase of food and fuel, lack of sanitation, and casual cruelty to animals.&lt;/description&gt;</field>
      <field name="desc_meta_file_display">&lt;description type="note"&gt;Thomas Jefferson Randolph and Alexander Rives are mentioned briefly.&lt;/description&gt;</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Reminiscencences of my Life and Work among the Freedmen of Charlottesville Virginia &gt;From March 1st 1866 To July 1st 1875 Vol. 1 Chapter First The New England Freedmens Aid Society was organized Feb. 7th 1862, having its headquarters in Room 8 Studio Building Tremont St. Boston Mass. Hon. John A. Andrew, the famous war governor of Massachusetts was the first President, and the Society numbered among its members some of the noted people of the time. Miss Hannah E. Stevenson was Secretary of the Teachers Committee when I received my commission as teacher. Other members whose names were well and widely known were Wm. Lloyd Garrison the famous abolitionist, Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney Lucretia Crocker, Thomas W. Higginson, Rev. John Parkman, Hon. Martin Brimmer, and many others whose names were regularly published in the "Freedmens Record" a small magazine, issued (at first) monthly, and later on at irregular intervals for a time until finally its publication was dropped. Auxiliary Branch Societies were organized in various towns throughout New England. Each Branch Society raising the sum of 500.00 yearly had a special teacher assigned to it, with whom the secretary of such society entered into correspondence upon matters relating to his or her school – (It was usually her as women teachers far outnumbered the men). Each teacher was expected to write, at least one letter, and make out a report of the school, every month to the parent Society in Boston, and a monthly letter to the Branch Society and it was frequently necessary to write two or three in place of one. For a time also they were expected to report monthly to the Freedmen's Bureau in Washington. In fact no Freedmens teacher ever had to seek far for an occasion to write a letter to somebody or for somebody. The main Society paid the salaries of the teachers and their travelling expenses to and from their schools every year. Buildings for school purposes were usually furnished by the War Department or Freedmen's Bureau. .taking any suitable building that had been used for Confederate hospitals or other Confederate purposes. These buildings were used until means could be procured to erect better ones. Money for this purpose was raised in various ways. Contributions from individuals and from Freedmen's Bureau and funds raised by the Freedmen themselves, all helped to swell the amount required, so that after a few years fairly comfortable and convenient buildings were erected in many of the larger cities and towns. Later on when the Societies and Bureau had closed their work the war impoverished towns of the South found these buildings a great help in starting the schools required by their new constitutions. After a few years the Freedmens Aid Society became a part of a national organization called The Freedmens Union Commission, and other changes took place, from time to time in that association as well as in the Freedmens Bureau. As fast as the people of the Confederate States showed a disposition to accept the situation and co-operate with the friends of education in the North, the Society gradually withdrew its teachers from the field, leaving the local school boards to take up and carry on the work they had begun — until finally in the late seventies the entire work was dropped as far as organized northern aid was concerned. The schools, well equipped with necessary furniture and other articles, were, from that time, continued and carried on under the auspices of the people of the South. In many instances the native colored teachers were adopted with the schools. This explanation will help to make the situation clear to any one, who, although having heard of the Freedmen's schools never knew how they originated or were supported. During the nine and a half years that I labored among these people, I met with many and varied experiences of a curious, interesting terrifying or comical nature, and have thought it might not be amiss to put such of these experiences as I can now recall, on paper, for future reference or the possible entertainment of other persons, and will begin with my journey to and first appearance in Charlottesville omitting all events this side the Potomac.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter Second I wonder if I shall ever forget the absorbing interest with which I looked from the car window as I traveled down the Orange &amp; Alexandria R. R. the morning of March 2d 1866. The names of the different stations as they were hurled at us by the shrill quick voice of the conductor — Brandy Manassas — Rappahannock — Orange — Culpepper Rapidan etc had each its little separate history that meant so much to me or some one that I knew. One year of peace had not effaced the outward scars of war. Remnants of old uniforms, old canteens, and the bleaching bones of horses were scattered all about, while here and there stockades and other defensive works still remained. "The Yankees have made a terrible piece of work of this country" said a lady who occupied a seat by my side a portion of the way. At Gordonsville the cars stopped half an hour for refreshments or some other cause, and it was curious to see the crowd of colored men, women, and children who seemed to spring out of the ground, as it were, each individual bearing aloft a tray of eatables. They flocked about the car windows vieing with each other in their efforts to secure the attention of the passengers. "Have a snack!" "Have a snack!" "Nice fresh snack!" came from many pairs of lips at once, while as many pairs of eyes threw beseeching glances upon the faces of the passengers inside. I succumbed to the combined entreaty of lips and eyes, and invested in a piece of some fried chicken, daintily couched upon a piece of bread, although I had brought a well filled lunch basket with me, the contents of which were not as yet exhausted. The chicken proved quite palatable, but its accessory, the bread, belonged to that unfortunate class of objects whose appearance is not such as to create a desire for a more intimate acquaintance so, as the train moved on I cast it forth, heedless as to whether it fell "upon the waters" or otherwise. If it did pray Heaven it may not "return" even "after many days." One source of constant anxiety to me was that at so many places where we stopped, there would be no station or other house in sight. Often the only sign of life would be a man standing upon an uncovered platform, a saddled-horse tied to a post, and two or three barrels and boxes doing duty for civilization I thought if Charlottesville should be like that what was I to do with my two trunks and no conveyance to take me anywhere. However as the train approached my destination there grew to be a more decidedly inhabited look about the country, and finally we steamed into Charlottesville, amid the shouts of hack drivers and porters. In something of a spirit of mischief I addressed myself to several white ladies asking where I could find Miss Anna Gardner, she being the teacher who had preceded me by several months, and with whom I was to be associated. Each one whom I addressed drew back with a cold stare and the reply "No, I don't know her." so I gained nothing by my questions but the curious, and not over friendly regard of the crowd assembled at the station. I was about to pursue my inquiries among the colored people where I knew I should get the information I required when I met another lady to whom I put my question. She, more courteous than the others pointed out an omnibus which she told me would take me where I wished to go, and even spoke to the driver for me. I learned her name afterwards, but regret to say I have forgotten it, but I have not forgotten her exceptional politeness Upon arriving at my destination I was deposited upon the broad piazza of an immense brick building the exterior of which struck me as being inan advanced state of dilapidation A wide hall, the door of which stood open passed through the centre terminating in a door at the rear, with a corridor running from midway to the left. At the right of the hall the whole lower floor formed one large room. At the left were four square rooms. I do not suppose I studied out this fact immediately upon entering, but having pointed out the features of the hall, enter into this further bit of information The only person in sight was a blue-coated soldier pacing the hall with a gun upon his shoulder. I was about to go forward and address him, when an officer stepped out of a door at the left. I explained my business to him, and he kindly sent a message to Miss Gardner, who was in school at that hour, to inform her of my arrival, and courteously invited me to dine with his family who were quartered there. This officer was Major Head — a man with many good qualities and one great failing — an occasional over indulgence in strong drink. While awaiting dinner Miss Gardner came in. Although this was our first meeting it seemed as if we were old acquaintances, as we were both Massachusetts women, and met upon what then seemed the soil of the enemy, and amid such formidable surroundings. And so began a friendship which lasted as long as she lived. After dinner Major Head and Miss Gardner held a council, and a room was given me on the second floor which had been occupied by a young man — Mr. Woodman — a teacher from Newburyport Mass. He had occupied the room but a short time and then gone to board in a family near by named Musgrove. Mr. Musgrove was also a teacher. The room was bare of furniture except a bedstead made of short pieces of timber for parts upon which strips of board had been mailed forming a rough frame to put a bed on. The straw bed used by Mr. W. was still there. There was also a primitive sort of a washstand with the bowl and pitcher of the previous occupant. Major Head sent his orderly for my trunks and when they arrived, Miss Gardner directed her woman to build a fire in the fireplace which stretched across a corner of the room, and brought me in a wooden chair, a small square table of the same rude style as the washstand and a short bench. I unpacked my trunks, made up my bed, having brought bedding for the purpose, hung up my dresses on nails that were driven in the wall, put some books and small articles on the broad mantelpiece and sat down feeling quite at home. I had come out expecting rough living, and should have been truly disappointed had I found home comforts and luxuries The next day I went with Miss Gardner to her school which was kept in a large wooden building erected by the Confederates for a hospital It was 140 feet long by some 70 feet in width and two stories high. This served us as a school building for three or four years, and for a portion of that time we had living rooms fitted up for ourselves in the second story. Here we had a school of four grades numbering something more than two hundred pupils, ranging in age from six to twenty five or thirty years, and of every shade of color from the purest blonde to the duskiest black. I even had for a time in my day school two women who were past sixty years of age, for old as well as young flocked to us hungering and thirsting for the knowledge which had been denied to them heretofore. Poor souls! It was hard to refuse any but our conveniences for teaching were limited. I opened an evening school where I instructed forty-five adults, three evenings in a week, and we encouraged our more advanced pupils to impart what they learned in school to their less favored friends; and this was the way the work began in Charlottesville. When at the end of nine and a half years I bade a final adieu to the scene of so much pleasant labor, I could hardly realize that this was the place where we had found a race of people so ignorant that they imagined "a right smart education" could be acquired by a few weeks study. Their mistakes in this matter were both ludicrous and pathetic. Said one man, who by his native shrewdness and industry had acquired some little property. "I shall take Sarah (his daughter) out of school. I have been sending her to Miss Anna dese six months and she dont know 'nuff to do my law business for me." But old and young learned, in time, that an education could not be acquired in six months or six years, and as time sped on the mists were lifted in a measure from their poor darkened eyes, and they began to realize that freedom meant ownership of themselves with the privilege of choosing their own occupations — not as theymany of them first thought, exemption from all labor.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter Third Charlottesville, Va. Charlottesville is on the Rivanna river, a branch of the James, and is about 118 miles southwest of Washington D. C. and 90 miles northwest of Richmond. The main range of the Blue Ridge mountains is some 20 miles northwest of the town but there are scattering spurs of this range all about the place. The Ragged Mts, as they are called, lie a little to the west or southwest while Monticello and some other eminences are near by the town. The scenery about the place is magnificent beyond description with the long blue line of the mountains in the distance, and the wooded giant hills near by. Sometimes in the early morning the sun would pour a flood of light upon the green upper portion of the mountain nearest us, and tinge with a variety of colors the clouds or mists hovering about one third of the way below the summit. Always beautiful, at such times its charms would be enhanced a hundred fold. No further words are needed for one to understand that Charlottesville, as far as locality is concerned must in the nature of things be a wonderfully beautiful place. The soil is of a reddish clay which during a rain forms into a clinging kind of mud, very unpleasant to travel through. During the years I was in the place there were very few street crossings such as we are accustomed to in northern towns. Instead they had what they called stepping stones — that is stones of vary ing shape and size placed at irregular distances across the street. One needed to be an expert gymnast to accomplish the crossing feat in safety. Should he happen to slip from the top of one of these curious conveniences, many of which would be round and smooth on the upper side, he would find himself liberally bespattered with a solution of the "sacred soil of Virginia." This same soil, however, was rich in nutriment for vegetation as the fields of corn, wheat, tobacco etc attested. The climate of Charlottesville is, of course much milder than that of New England. Still there was much cold weather in the winters, and the mercury would sometimes fall below the zero mark and there would be snowfalls of considerable depth. But the snow never lasted long — scarcely as long as the mud it helped to form, and Spring greeted us quite early. High winds were frequent and sometimes terrifying. We never remained through the hottest season — always coming north the last of June or first of July. The incorporated town, or rather city of Charlottesville numbered some 4000 inhabitants in the late sixties. It was the county seat of Albemarle. Outside the town limits was a considerable area of unincorporated land in Albemarle Co. belonging to Charlottesville township. Our school was outside the corporation, as was also the University of Va. A stranger visiting Charlottesville was likely to be impressed by the sight of the liberal handiwork of Nature, and the very meagre assistance she had received from man. For a town of its size the place was singularly destitute of municipal conveniences. There was no adequate water supply, wells being the sole dependence in this respect, and one well often had to serve for several families, consequently instead of being placed conveniently near one house they were usually arranged so to be inconvenient for all. The water was very good however, and was brought into the houses in pails or pitchers by servants, who often carried these vessels on their heads. I have seen the woman who worked for us bring three full pails of water at one time — one on her head and one in each hand. I asked her once if she couldn't manage to carry one on each shoulder too. Aside from the lack of water I think there was no fire company or any kind of fire apparatus in the town, so any building that caught fire might well be considered as doomed, and it is really a matter of great surprise that during the years that I was there, there was never a serious conflagration. A IA good many isolated buildings were burned, but there were no fires on a large scale. In case of a fire the citizens turned to and did what they could in carrying water and other work necessary to subdue the flames or save property, but it was unorganized work and very inefficient. I never learned whether there was any regular system for taking care of the streets, but all the highways in and about the town were in a very poor condition. Outside the more populous part of the town the sidewalks were usually of plank, and always more or less broken and dilapidated, and the unpaved streets after a heavy rain would be a mass of sticky mud. Wheels would sometimes sink nearly to their hubs, and the poor horses had a hard time dragging themselves and their loads through it. Sometimes the country roads would be impassible for days at a time, and there would be a famine in such articles as fuel, fresh meat, poultry, butter eggs and milk. I remember one time when we could get no wood on account of the state of the roads caused by a prolonged rainstorm, and should have suffered for want of a fire had not some of our boys brought us wood from their homes in bags slung over their shoulders There was probably a dealer in wood and coal in the town, but the business must have been on a small scale, and when we needed fuel we would have some of the older boys watch for a load of wood coming in from the country — make a bargain for it, and have it put in the place of storage. To a New Englander this seems rather a hap-hazard way of getting supplies, but it was the best we could do at that time. The markets also seemed to depend upon the local country supplies for meat vegetables, butter eggs etc. We could rarely get good beef, and the flesh of the scavenger swine had no temptation for us, but the mutton, lamb, and poultry were excellent. We also had an occasional meal of venison, as well as some of the smaller wild game, as squirrels, pheasants etc. I often regret that I made no effort to try a bit of 'possum, but I did not think much about it while there. When I first went out it was hard to get butter fit to eat, but after awhile we learned to watch for country dealers, and get a supply from them. In those early years all provisions were very high. I do not recall the price of butter, but I remember I paid 25 cts a pound for granulated sugar, and 40 cts for raisins. Milk was ten cents a quart, and very blue and creamless at that. I could get no salt pork such as we have in the north — everything was bacon. Baked beans of New England style were unknown. One of the colored women heard me bemoan the fact that I could have no baked beans, so she set herself to work to prepare some for me. First she boiled the beans to a mush and rubbed them through a strainer, then formed them into small round cakes and baked them. They were quite palatable but didn't seem much like the real article. A little experience with Virginia beans showed me that many of them were tenanted by a small black bug. This was not appetizing so I learned to carry beans, salt pork and bean pot as well as many other articles of food with me and after that I had my regular dish of New England baked beans. I did a good deal of my own cooking as the Virginia methods were too rich to be healthful for ones regular diet, but the cooks were masters of the art in their own way, and I shall never forget their delicious fried chicken and Sally Lunns. A good deal of their cooking was done by an old fashioned fireplace. For baking they used a large, round, flat kettle with a tight fitting cover, which they called an oven. As I never witnessed the process of baking in it, I do not know how it was managed; but however it was done they usually made a success of their work. There were quite a number of grocerys and dry good stores in town.— two or three druggists and about the same number of Jewellers. There was no large city nearer than Richmond so peopledepended largely upon the local merchants. I never heard that there was any law regulating the sale of liquor, so every grocery was a liquor store as well. The drinking habit was almost universal, and persons in a state of beastly intoxication a common sight on the street. There was one policeman, called the Town Sergeant who was supposed to keep order in the place, and I think there were a few others detailed for extra duty, but street fights and rowdyism prevailed, and even murders were so common as to have lost the power of inspiring the horror they would in one of our northern towns of like size. All this seems the more remarkable when we remember that Charlottesville is a town of the highest culture and great refinement. In trying to account for this extraordinary state of things, one must remember that many different causes have combined to effect this difference. The very foundations of Virginia and New England were as different as possible. There could be little in common between the earnest, sober, hard working Puritans ofthe northern section, and the gay, idle, impecunious and extravagant younger sons of noblemen who settled Virginia. The climatic influences were different, and more than all, the habits of thought and feeling engendered by slavery tended to develope a recklessness of action among the people which culture scarcely seemed to soften to any great extent. The town was not protected from epidemics of sickness by any very rigid sanitary measures. I understood that there was a law protecting buzzards, as they were the necessary scavengers of the streets, and by ways of the town. Dead dogs, cats, and other creatures were thrown on to some vacant lot for these loathsome birds to feast upon. There was very little pretence of effort to encourage public cleanliness, and all sorts of refuse matter lay about unheeded. During my first years there cattle and pigs roamed the streets at will. Often the only subsistence of the cow of some poor person, was what she gathered at the roadside, and on open unoccupied lots. The swine were the efficient assistants of the buzzards, as scavengers. The people of the place were professedly religious and there were a goodly number of churches of the various Orthodox denominations — Presbyterians Methodists, Baptists, Carmelites Episcopalian and a sect called Christians, and I think there was a Jewish synagogue, as there were a good many Jews in the town. Our position as teachers of the Freedmen was such as to shut us out of the sympathy and society of the white people generally, so I can say but little in regard to them socially except that I have reason to think they were, in their own way, very kind and charming people. A few — a very few met us with some degree of cordiality, and we found them very agreeable, but we went there immediately after the close of the war, and it was too soon for us to expect the feeling of bitterness to have died out. We ourselves had suffered and carried the bitterness of that suffering in our own souls, but these people had witnessed the death of all they had hoped for and fought for. — and we were Yankees. It could not have been easy for them to look upon us as friends so soon particularly in view of the work we went there to do, which, to their minds was not a friendly one. There were no public schools in Charlottesville when I went there, but these came in with the new state constitution. There was a young ladies school, or seminary, but if I ever heard how it was managed I have forgotten. There was a school for boys taught by a Mr. Williams. The school was within a few rods of our own, and as I think of it now its seems remarkable that there was never a clash between the boys of the two schools. There were probably other private schools in the place, but I either never heard of them, or have forgotten them. I never saw any snuff dipping while there, although tobacco in other forms was universally used by the men, and not unfrequently by the women. It was quite common for little boys to both smoke and chew tobacco, and it was necessary for us to take a firm stand against its use in school, or the boys would have chewed during school hours. However when they found it must be no tobacco, or no school they submitted with such grace as they could. Another rather alarming habit of the male population was carrying pistols. Even the colored boys soon acquired the habit, and several times I found it necessary to take pistols from boys who had brought them to school. A stranger coming into my school-room might have thought I had to resort to desperate measures to govern my school seeing one or two revolvers lying on my table. But the boys soon learned that pistols like tobacco were not allowed in school, and I ceased to be annoyed by them which was no small relief. A little way to the west of Charlottesville, among the Ragged Mts. lived a class of people known as "poor whites." They were exactly as one sees them represented in pictures or on the stage — long, lank, with straight unkempt locks, and nondescript clothes. I would often see a whole family — man, woman and several children come up the railroad track together on a Saturday morning each with a pail of meagre looking strawberries to sell. These they would dispose of for a small sum, and lay out the proceeds in a little bacon and corn meal, the larger part going for whisky and tobacco. If we walked down the street a little later in the day we would be likely to find them sitting contentedly on the curbstone, smoking their pipes and talking over the incidents of the day. Thus the whole family would spend the entire dayin doing what one bright boy could have done in half the time, except, perhaps the amount of smoking accomplished. I was told that some of these people lived in a kind of hut with only the bare earth for a floor, and that they generously shared these primitive accommodations with their pigs and fowls, as well as their dogs. There seemed to be no very extensive manufacturies in or about Charlottesville. All that I can now recall are the Charlottesville Woolen Mills —(the extent of which I never learned), and a brick yard which occupied the lot next our school. The land being a red clay was particularly suited to this purpose. The works were not extensive — there being only a small number of kilns. I fancy all the bricks made there found a market in the town or vicinity but I may be mistaken. Travelling about the vicinity was largely done on horse-back, two or three person after riding together on one horse. I once saw a man riding with a harrow fastenedin some way upon the back of the horse behind him. It was probably much easier getting over the rough roads on horseback than in a carriage. An omnibus used to run between the town and the University with some attempt at regularity. Railroad accommodations were not very good at that time. The Orange &amp; Alexandria R. R. extended from Washington through the town to Lynchburg. (How much, if any farther, I do not know) and the Virginia Central fromRichmond through Charlottesville to Staunton — perhaps farther. These roads formed a junction near our school, and I think used the same track to Gordonsville where the lines separated again. There were only two passenger trains per day each way on either road passing through both ways near noon and midnight. The dwelling houses, as far as they came under my observation were not generally constructed with aneye to convenience in the same degree as houses of the same class in the north. The kitchens were usually small separate buildings in the rear of the main house, and very little thought seemed to have been given to the idea of making one's labor light. That would naturally be a remote consideration to people who had no practical knowledge of household labor themselves, and who with their numerous slaves could see no occasion for labor saving conveniences: and so the work was done, in what seemed to us a very hard as well as slip-shod way. There was no law for the protection of dumb animals, and there seemed to be a deplorable lack of feeling in regard to their sufferings from the thoughtlessness and cruelty of their owners. No doubt there were many of the citizens whose feelings like our own were outraged by the barbarities inflicted upon the lower creatures, but there was little that could be done, with no law, and no visible public sentiment on the side of kindness. Cows would wander about on the outskirts of the town all winter, nibbling the dead grass by the wayside or getting a slender feast from the sides of an occasional haystack. Mere skeletons they seemed scarcely able to drag themselves about — without shelter in the coldest storms of winter. Spring must have seemed doubly beautiful to them. Horses were overloaded, overdriven and beaten without the slightest show of mercy. Slavery had hardened the hearts of both master and slave, and all animals had to suffer in consequence. Of course there were exceptions, but brutality was such an ever present habit that we came to regard it as the hard unfailing rule. It was the custom in Charlottesville to keep a great many dogs,— partly for hunting and partly for protection from marauders. If a man were in moderate circumstances he might content himself with two or three, but if he werevery poor indeed he would perhaps have five or six. These dogs were usually ferocious and when one had occasion to call at a home he was likely to be met by three or four yelping, snarling canines. People usually waited at the gate for some one to come and call the creatures off, but never having been accustomed to savage dogs, I at first paid no attention to their apparent ferocity and would go right on up to the door through the snarling pack, supposing that this was their eccentric way of welcoming a stranger. I wonder now that I am here to tell of it, but I really had no idea that they were dangerous until I witnessed the surprise of people at what they looked upon as my temerity. Perhaps the fact that I showed no fear, held the savage brutes in awe. Through the early years of the Civil War, Charlottesville escaped the ravages of the marching armies, and became a rendezvous for the sick and wounded. The spacious buildings of the University of Va. were putto hospital uses along with the three storied Mudwall or Delevan House, which was our home for a time. There were also five or six rough wooden hospital buildings erected near by the largest of which was 140 ft long by about 70 ft in width and two stories high. The sick and wounded Confederate soldiers and a few Union prisoners in like condition were cared for here. Among the latter was Major Savage, a brother of the wife of Prof. Wm. B. Rogers who, with some other 13 or 14 Union prisoners died here, and were buried in the cemetary attached to the University grounds where, in after years we would go occasionally to lay our offering of flowers in memory of those whose graves were beyond our reach. Later on their remains were removed to the national cemetary at Culpepper. Many were the delicacies these poor Union soldiers received from the hands of the colored people, conveyed to them in various secret ways. When Sheridan made his famous raid through this part of Virginia the people of this place got their first taste of what war meant at their own door. As there were no troops to oppose them the town escaped the ruin which is the usual fate of places where battles are fought. Sheridan soon moved on, and many of the slaves followed in the wake of the army — refugeed they called it. Among the most noted men of Charlottesville was Judge Alexander Rives whose residence — Carlton — was on the outskirts of the town. If my memory serves me correctly he was a brother of the Hon. Wm. C. Rives at one time minister to France, and early lover of Eugenie who afterward married Napoleon 3d Judge Rives was a cultured high-bred gentleman — one of whom Virginia could well afford to be proud. I understand from the colored woman who had been the nurse of his children that he graduated from Harvard College. He was a large slaveholder, and keen sighted enough to see that secession meant the death of this peculiar institution, consequently he cast his vote against the measure. This roused the ire of the hot blooded young secession element, and a party of young men— presumably mostly students from the University — went out to his place one night, and cut off the tops of two rows of young shade trees which had recently been planted on both sides of the long avenue leading up to his house. It is gratifying to be able to say that this act of vandalism failed in its object as the cutting only served to make them take on a more symmetrical form. However Judge Rives might oppose secession he was a true Virginian rather than a true American, and went with his state. After the war was over he wisely accepted the situation and gave his hearty support to the U.S. government. It was my good fortune to hear him deliver an elequent address before the delegates to the Constitutional Convention at Richmond. He became one of the trustees of the Hampton Normal school at the solicitation of Gen. Armstrong who came to Charlottesville for that purpose, and called on us while there. He also became one of the trustees of our school at Charlottesville, and in doing so became a member of the same board as one of his ex-slaves Paul Lewis, his one time body servant. Another noted citizen was Col. Jefferson Randolph, a grandson of Thomas Jefferson. He with several other gentlemen of the place addressed the colored people on the grounds in front of our school house previous to the election of delegates to the constitutional convention. He was a white haired old man at this time and began his address by telling the colored people that many years before he had favored emancipation. Perhaps the words of his distinguished grandfather rang in his ears. "I tremble for my country when I remember that God is just." There were several other men of considerable note of whom I can now recall only the names like Judge Cochrane, Profs Miner and McGuffy of the University and many whose names even have escaped me. I have tried to make as correct and faithful a picture as possible of Charlottesville as I knew it, and if some things seem exaggerated I can only say that I have written without prejudice, and have told all things as I found them to the best of my recollection. I often regret that I took no notes when there — but never dreamed I should have occasion to use them, and was too much absorbed in my daily work to give any thought to such matters.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter Fourth Monticello Monticello, the mountain upon which stood the home of Thomas Jefferson was one and a half or possibly two miles from the centre of the town of Charlottesville, and a little farther from our school We made several visits to the place during the years we were there — visits that have left a vivid impression of the magnificent beauty of the place, and of the terrible condition of the road we had to travel to reach it. Visitors must have recalled the old tune "Jordans a hard road to trabel" when making a trip over this particular piece of highway. Before reaching the foot of the mountain, whether by the regular road or by driving through the grounds of "Carlton" Judge Rives place it was necessary to ford the river, as there was no bridge at the time. This feat was accomplished with much splashing and jerking. The water being very muddy like all streams in that part of Virginia it was necessary that the uninitiated should exercise a wholesome faith in horse, driver and vehicle in order to insure her own comfort when it would seem sometimes as if the horse was about to disappear altogether. The ascent of the mountain was by a road, than which than which nothing could possibly be worse. When I remember the rocks, stumps and gullies that filled what was by courtesy called the road, I wonder that horses could have dragged us up, or that any vehicle could have been made that would stand such a strain. But our courage was always equal to the venture and the object attained justified our efforts. The view from the summit was magnificent beyond description. In one direction was the long level line of the horizon with nothing to obstruct the vision Below us the town and all about waving fields of grain with the silver thread of the Rivanna winding through the green fields and meadows. No Eden could be fairer. The house is a stately old mansion. Through the front door we entered a hall octagonal or hexagonal in form (I cannot be sure which but think it was a hexagon) A clock over the front door showed a dial both outside and inside; the weights hanging on each side of the door in the hall. A gallery ran around a portion of the hall at the height of the second floor. On a high shelf at our rightthe left of the door stood a bust of Voltaire. The floor of the hall was a wonderful piece of work. A hexagonal figure of some dark wood, nine or ten inches in diameter, framed by very light wood possibly two inches wide the whole put together so nicely that it seemed like one solid board very highly polished. This was the work of one of his slaves and is a marvel of beauty and perfection. It was into this hall that the British Col. Tarleton rode his horse when he came with his troopers to capture Jefferson, who discovered their approach in season to escape into the mountain by a secret passage. We were told that the marks of his horses shoes could be found on the floor of the hall but we failed to discover them. We visited the parlor and library and went up stairs. Such curious, narrow, wholly enclosed windingflights of stairs! It would be impossible to take a large modern chair up over them. The bedrooms were very peculiar. Each had an alcove as large as a full sized bed with slats of wood fitted in lengthwise upon which the bed was made, so no bedsteads were required and no one could get to the bed except from the front. The windows swung in and out as transomes sometimes do. There seemed but little to see that had belonged to the distinguished owner. In a chamber we were shown the chair he used after his health failed — a plain wooden rocker. The slave quarters consisted of long low building divided into small compartments, neither so comfortable or cheerful as we should provide for our cattle. The grounds about the house must have been beautiful when Jefferson was there to care for them. A little way from the summit of the mountain is the family burial place which we visited, and from which I once brought away a root of very beautiful ivy, and one of periwinkle and sent them to a friend who planted them and they flourished for years. At that time Jeffersons monument had suffered much at the hands of vandal sight-seers and was dreadfully defaced by pieces of the stone being chipped off to carry away as relics. I hope the place is better cared for now, and that it has been made more convenient for tourists to reach the home of one of Virginia's greatest men. It would seem as if it might be made interesting by putting the place in charge of some one capable of giving information on many points, which the curious visitor of my day had to content himself to do without. It would be of especial interest to strangers to be shown theavenue through which Jefferson escaped the clutches of Tarleton as well as many other points of interest, but even as I saw it I found it very interesting — so interesting that after the lapse of thirty years it stands as a vivid picture in my memory, and I would give much to repeat the tour and see through my age-dimmed vision that which charmed the clear eyes of my younger days.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter Fifth The University of Virginia I regret that I did not learn in what year this University was founded — only that it was the offspring of the brain of Thomas Jefferson so it must have been very late in the 18th or early in the 19th century. It is, I should say, about three fourths of a mile from the centre of Charlottesville on the Virginia Central R. R. near its junction with the Orange &amp; Alexandria R .R. The college grounds are enclosed by the main buildings at one end from the right and left sides of which extend the dormitories of the students. So many years have passed since I visited the place that my recollections of it all are very dim. I remember that the students had formed themselves into two societies — the Washington Society and the Jefferson Society. Each Society had its own hall. In Jefferson hall I think there was a fine copy of Raphaels "School of Athens" each figure in the group being life size. A fine statue of Jefferson was placed in position during the years I was there. An excellent whispering gallery was a feature of one of the rooms of the building. Jeffersons whole soul went into the planning and making of this University, and he watched its material progress with the closest scrutiny and deepest anxiety. I am afraid he would have found less satisfaction in the mental and moral progress of the students had he come upon the scene about a century later. This is only a whisper however, and detracts nothing from the moral value of his efforts to establish a model University. Young men from all parts of the South and some parts of the North came here as students. Any one living near the University would soon become impressed with the idea that it was a pretty wild and reckless crowd judging from appearances Probably the larger part were orderly and studious but the disorderly and reckless elements are always more in evidence from the very fact of their disorderliness, and our experience of them as neighbors did not tend to raise them in our estimation as a whole. Woe to the unfortunate individual, behe professor or citizen of the town who in any way gained the ill will of one of these students. With faces masked, and torches made of brooms dipped in tar and lighted they would march to his house to the music of tin pans and tin horns, and surrounding the building make night hideous as only yelling demons can. The victim might not always escape with only a Calithump. Injury to person and property were not uncommon, and murder not unknown. As we lived about half way between the town and the University we were naturally objects of some interest to them, although they never treated us to a Calithump. During the first few years of our work there, they probably felt that we were in a way under the protection of the national government and in later years they had become accustomed to our work there so we were never seriously disturbed. I do not mean by this that we were wholly ignored, for they often paid us the compliment of threats, or broke our windows or showed us some other delicate attention of a similar nature. At one time they had a habit of climbing upon the top of the cars of the Va. Central trains that stopped at the University station. With their pockets filled with stones, as the train moved on they would throw these missiles right and left as they pleased. The train passed within a rod of our school building, and they would sometimes make a target of our windows, two or three times breaking every pane of glass in a window. This was expensive as well as unpleasant for us. One Saturday when I heard the train coming I seated myself quietly at my open window facing the track, book in hand. As the train drew near I could see that every one had a stone ready. I looked up from my book innocently as if it had never occurred to me that they would do so brutal a thing as to throw — and they didn't. Disgusted with their conduct the railroad company refused to allow the trains to stop at the University soafter that when it was necessary for them to take the cars they were compelled to go down town to do so. On the night that the news was received of the first election of Gen. Grant to the Presidency I was roused from a sound sleep by the crashing of stones through the window of my sitting room. A party of students had been down town to get the election returns, and, furious at learning of the Republican success vented their spite in that way, making the act energetic by a vigorous accompaniment of oaths and imprecations — as if we could have prevented the election of Grant had we wished to do so — which we didn't. It was fortunate for me that my bedroom was in the rear of my sitting room. Had it been otherwise the consequences might have been serious. During the years when the Ku Klux were causing so much disturbance in the South, they once left a picture of a coffin with the regulation mark K. K. K. upon it at our door, and they made various efforts to annoy us — perhaps with a view of frightening us away, not considering perhaps, that had we been timid and easily frightened we should not have gone in the first place. I have mentioned these two or three instances of their exhibition of ill will toward us as Yankees, and toward our work of educating the freed people, as specimens of some of the annoyances to which we were occasionally subjected, but it would lengthen this chapter unnecessarily to recount them all, even if I could remember them. They formed a unique part of our experience there and I have introduced enough to make the whole easily comprehended. On a few occasions some of the Professors or students visited our schools. This we were always glad to have them do, hoping in this way to arouse an interest in our work there, and we often had a good dealof satisfaction in hearing through various sources, that they had been very favorably impressed with what they had seen and heard. One of the Professors even complimented our work highly in an article published in the local paper. Coming from such a source it meant a good deal to us. One day — late in the afternoon — I was surprised by the entrance of two young men who walked up to my platform, their faces beaming with smiles and introduced themselves in this wise. "We are students from the University. We study Moral Philosophy under Prof. McGuffey, and we are anxious to know something of the workings of your school system." This was all so sudden, and they were so breezy and so sunny, that I found myself shaking hands with them without any volition on my own part, and giving them a smiling welcome, before I fully realized their presence. I had seats placed for them and went on with the lesson that was in progress when they entered to which they listened with every appearance of interest. I strongly suspected that the interest was all on the surface, but if so they were good actors and commended what they heard very highly, and rising they bowed themselves out saying they wished to visit the other rooms. It was evident they had been drinking a little although not what one could call the worse for liquor — only excessively polite. When they went to Miss Gardners room it was quite late in P. M. and she had already dismissed a class of boys, who had stopped in the vicinity of the school house for a game of ball. Soon after they left my room it was time for me to close school, and some of my boys told those of Miss Gardners who were outside that two drunken students had gone into her school-room, upon which six or seven of her larger boys — grown young men — sent for her to come to the door, and volunteered to remove the students if she wished them to do so. She thanked the boys but assured them that she was very glad to have the young men visit the school, as they were perfectly well behaved and exceptionally intelligent. She took a good deal of pain to show them what her pupils could do, and they confessed they were much surprised as well as pleased. After my school was dismissed I remained in the room while some of the girls put it in order for the next day. I stood upon the platform with one hand full of tiny flags which had been used in an entertainment the night before, and which I had gathered from the desks where they had been left. When the students coming form Miss Gardners room were about to pass my door, seeing me they came in to tell how well they had been entertained there. Then one of them said, referring to the flags in my hand "Shall we take one?" I replied "Certainly" when each took a flag and stuck in the lapel of his coat saying as they did so "We will wear them in remembrance of you." As I knew that many of the students had been Confederate soldiers I embraced the opportunity for a little hit. "O no!" said I "Wear them as an emblem of the Union." "I don't know as we shall prize them much as an emblem of the Union." was the reply "But we will wear them in remembrance of you and your school." and bowing politely they passed out. We learned afterwards that they spoke in the highest terms of the school, and the proficiency of the colored pupils in their studies, and we were also told that these two students were at the head of the classes. We were the recipients of frequent notes from students expressing an interest in our work and asking permission to call on us. We invariable replied that we should be pleased to receive them as visitors in our school any day they chose to call. On a few occasions some of them called at our rooms without the formality of a not asking permission — merely sending up a card at the door. At such times Miss Gardner always insisted, spite of my protests, that we should receive them. However I took care to throw the burden of the conversation upon her, which I think was much to her liking, as I knew she enjoyed subjecting them to a moral and intellectual dissection. More than once while we were in C. there were quarrels among the students which ended fatally. Knives and pistols would be drawn upon the slightest provocation, but if a student were arrested and put into the jail his fellow students would batter down the doors and release him. In what was called the "University Burying Ground" we were shown the graves of two professors who were murdered by students. The rougher element among them showed a special spite toward any colored man or boy who was neatly dressed, usually knocking him from the sidewalk if nothing worse. Occasionally some high spirited young colored man would resent such interference when perhaps pistols would be drawn on both sides. Luckily in every instance that came to my knowledge there were cooler heads who used their influence with both parties and prevented blood shed — and possibly a race war. As for the young women and girls, many of whom were nearly or quite white, and some of them remarkably pretty — they were in constantdanger of insult and abusive treatment, and the young colored men were frequently warned of punishment that would be meted out to them if they were rash enough to act as protectors of these girls by escorting them when it was necessary for them to go out in the evening. If a young girl left unprotected in the evening reached her destination unharmed, she could well consider herself as cared for by a special Providence. In these days when I hear so much of the crimes committed by whitecolored men upon white women, I hearken back to that time when I knew that any colored woman was looked upon by (shall I say) a majority of the white men of the community as their rightful prey, and she was in a sense helpless and unprotected by the law as well as by public opinion. It seems a terrible accusation to make, but nevertheless I believe that at the time I was there, there was nothing else in the locality that had so demoralizing an effect upon the colored youth of both sexes as our vicinity to the University of Virginia. Many of the growing boys were employed asby students as servants where they were pretty sure to receive an education of a most undesirable and vicious nature. And the girls — just released from slavery where their status was about the same as that of the domestic animals — is it any wonder that many of them were morally weak while all were practically defenceless? And it was a common and bitter experience with us to have some girl of whom we had hoped to make a bright particular star for the guidance and uplifting of the race, disappoint our hopes in the cruelest way through the temptations and influences emanating from the University. I have not written thus strongly in condemnation of the University and its students, because of the occasional annoyances we suffered through their actions. On the contrary I have vainly endeavored to recall something of which I can speak more favorably but my utmost efforts to do so have failed. I am sorry for I would like to say something pleasant of this great work of Jefferson — this largest of Southern universities. I have "set down naught in malice" and heartily wish it might have been my good fortune to have caught an occasional glimpse of the "silver lining" behind the clouds I have described. I firmly believe the "silver lining" was there, but from our position only the dark side was apparent. It would give me great pleasure to learn that the unfortunate conditions I have described no longer exist and that this great college has attained to the ideal of its founder.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter Sixth Our Homes and School Houses Our first home was in the large brick building described in a previous chapter and known as the Mudwall, or Delavan. It was three stories high and there were eight rooms on the 2d floor and the same number on the 3d. The lower floor was described in Chap. 2d There was also a basement with several cellar-like rooms where some of the very poorest colored people were allowed to burrow while the property was held by the U. S. government. The rooms above were all exactly alike. A door opened from the hall, opposite which was one large window. A fireplace was built across the corner of the room, over which was a mantel. There were no closets nor anything to take away the bare appearance of the plastered walls. My room was furnished at first as described in Chapter 2d but I gradually accumulated a few necessary articles as a desk, an extra chair or two etc. It did not r equire much to make me comfortable then, and bare walls, and barer floors were circumstances hardly worth considering as I mentally contrasted the luxury of our surroundings with the homeless life of the poor soldiers whose toil and sufferings had made this opportunity possible. This was our home for the first year and a portion of the second. Our schoolrooms were in the long building mentioned in a previous chapter. My own was at the front end to the left of the hall. Mrs. Gibbons' one of the colored teachers was opposite mine at the right. Miss Gardner at the extreme rear at the left, and Mr. Pratts (previously taught by Mr. Musgrove a citizen of the place, and after Mr. Pratt left by Paul Lewis one of Miss Gardners pupils) was opposite hers. Between my room and Miss Gardners were two large rooms, which served as a place for the pupils wraps, a storage for fuel and other purposes. The large space between the two schoolrooms on the right was used for a time by the colored people for a Baptist church. While Mr. Woodman taught there his school was upstairs on the right side at the front. Paul Lewis with his family hadliving rooms up there, and also his father and mother, who had with them a daughter son and grandson. Beside the rooms I have mentioned there was a large amount of unoccupied space until the Delavan, where we lived was ceded back to the original owners by the United States government when Miss Gardner and I had each two rooms fitted up there for our own use.which we occupied April 5th 1867 These rooms were quite large. My sitting room had two windows at the north and two looking east — my bedroom one window only facing east. This rear room was my dining room and storage place as well as chamber. The two occupied the space immediately above my schoolroom. The inner walls of the whole building were clap-boarded like the outside of a house. These wall were freshly whitewashed every year as long as we lived there, and the school-rooms were decorated with wreaths and arches of evergreen which the boys would go out and gather at stated times when all hands would go to work to decorate. One huge wreath made on a barrel hoop was hung from the ceiling in the centre of the room. Arches were placed above each door and window, and large wreaths hung in the spaces between. The effect was very pretty and cheerful taking away the grim unfinished look of the rough walls. We were too much interested in our work and too busy to let our imagination dwell upon the dark stains here and there upon the floors, stains as un-removable as those upon the keys of Bluebeard — and as significant, but the superstition of some of our colored friends peopled the building with phantom soldiers who flitted restlessly about the place at night. Poor fellows! If they did gather about the last scenes of their life on earth, they kindly refrained from disturbing us, and we lived there as serenely as if there were no phantoms of friends or enemies about us. For some years our school furniture consisted of rough benches without backs or desks and a few rough tables doing duty as desks. Indeed we had little else until we built a school house some years later. The furnishings of my sitting room consisted of an air tight stove, a long narrow rough table which I covered with a green cloth and upon which I kept books, ornaments etc. a small table, four or five chairs and a wood box. Anything served as an ornament for the walls — wreaths pictures cut from magazines and papers etc. This was our home and work shop for some three years or a little more andI will try to give here a rough outline of the building as I recall it now after the lapse of more than thirty five years. Pencil drawings of first and second floors with descriptions of rooms written in ink. The drawing on the left side of the page is of the "First Story" with Front Door, Rear Door and internal doors marked and most windows noted with a "W." Rooms on the left of the center hall are labeled "School room Mrs. G. "Bap Church" "School room Mr. M., Mr. P and P. Lewis." Rooms on the right of the center hall are "School room Miss C." two storage rooms (with a hall to an exterior door between them) both identified as "Rear room" then "School room Miss G." The drawing on the right side of the page is identified as the "Second Story" with internal doors and windows marked. Rooms on the left of the center hall are "School room one year Mr. W. an unmarked room, "Bedroom Miss Gardner and "Miss G. sitting room." Rooms on the right of the center hall are "Miss C. sitting room" "Bedroom Miss Carkin and four rooms marked in two places as "P. Lewis rooms." The points of the compass on these rough plans (drawn mostly in pencil for convenience) are those used on maps so one can see that the house fronted north or nearly so. The Orange &amp; Alexandria R. R. passed directly in front of the building not more than a rod from the door, and there was a large open lot between the railroad and the street which our pupils used as a playground. On the east of the school-house was a small brick yard, and there was quite an extent of open ground at the west and south. At the end of the time mentioned above the U. S. government gave the building for a school, and with help from the Freedmens Bureau and the aid gained through friends at the North and some work on our own part in getting up entertainments of various kinds we got the means to buy the land and take down and rebuild the house in a manner better suited to the purposes of a school. This wasmostly done during the summer vacation of three months although we found quite a little to be completed when we returned to our work in October. The new house had two schoolrooms in the first and two on the second floor. In the rear of the lower schoolrooms were two living rooms for the janitors family — Paul Lewis one of the teachers acting in that capacity at first. Miss Gardner and I each had a sitting room above the janitors rooms and we also each had a rough room fitted up as a sleeping room in the loft. By this time we had begun to come to an appetite for a few simple luxuries, so I got wall paper and put it on myself and we each indulged in a modest carpet. Miss Gardner bought a second hand lounge, and I got together some pieces of timber and boards, and with the aid of one of the boys built one for myself stuffing and covering it nicely, so at last we began to live in a civilized way. Aside from one or two slight changes we had made in the building everything seemed settled for the rest of the time we remained there. The changes consisted in enlarging one of the lower rooms by taking in the hall which gave space for a small stage or platform where we could have entertainments or other gatherings. A piazza was also built each side of the projecting porch, and doors were cut from our living rooms up stairs into our school-rooms. The schools were all furnished with plain double desks black boards and maps, and a few pictures. A small library was collected for the use of the schools, and later a Worcesters Unabridged Dictionary and a magnetic gloveglobe were sent us as well as a few other necessary small articles. We used as text books Hilliards Readers, Kerls Grammar, Greenleafs and Robinsons Arithmetics, Colton &amp; Fitchers Geography various books on U. S. History, Geology, Algebra Philosophy, Botany, Literature etc. In short we were not confined to special text books, but read and taught from what seemed to offer the best instruction. We naturally became much attached to the homes and schools that had grown up under our hands, and gained in usefulness and comfort with the years, and although some of the details of that old time picture cannot now be accurately recalled, the general idea of the whole seems to stand out as clearly as ever. In a sense our home there was more to us than it might have been under other circumstances for we had little or nothing outside our home and our work, except as it reached out and included the social religious and political life of the people: and although these lines of work reached far out into the country about us, they all centred in the spot where we lived and worked.

The upper hall should have been made wider with little ante rooms at the entrance to the school rooms. There was a stairway leading to the attic near the entrance of the rear hall and under the whole school house was a basement wood room</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter Seventh The Military When I reached Charlottesville March 2d – 66 I found a small guard of soldiers stationed there under command of Major Head. I think these troops belonged to some Pennsylvania regiment but do not remember which one. The Majors Headquarters were in the Delevan where we had our first home, and the soldiers barracks were at first in the long building where we had our schools, but they were soon removed to the good-sized structure connected to the rear of the Delevan by a square platform: so we who were occupants of the house lived a kind of semi-military life. As our work took us to our schoolrooms frequently in the evening we became quite accustomed to the challenge of the sentinel on our return "Who goes there?" "Friends." "Advance friends and be recognized." after which ceremony we could pass into the building and up to our rooms. The presence of Mrs. Head whose mother and sister visited her separately during the spring, gave us a little pleasant Society. Major Head was a good disciplinarian and as a rule the soldiers were orderly, but occasionally some one would be guilty of some misconduct — usually it would be a case of too much strong drink — and be put under guard. Such cases usually came under our notice as the guard would have to bring his prisoner to the common pump to wash his face and hands. One morning when I rang my bell, a very young soldier under guard at the pump, evidently under the impression that he was a school boy, walked quietly in and took his seat with the boys in spite of the protestations of his guard who was too much taken by surprise at his unexpected movement to stop him before he got in and seated himself. It was quite evident that he was under a drunken delusion, and it took considerable energetic coaxing on the part of his guard to get him away. Judging from his looks he had not been long out of school. Occasionally some of the soldiers would indulge in a little sport at the expense of the colored boys, and frighten them by chasing them around the building when they were sure the Yankee teachers were not where they could see them. But we always knew about it for some of the boys were sure to complain to us that the "Yankees have been running us." All soldiers who wore a blue uniform were "Yankees" to them, whether they came from Maine or Oregon. We rarely heard them spoken of as soldiers. In fact I think the white people always gave them this title — to them a most opprobrious term. But whatever may have been the faults of these soldiers, we were treated with the utmost courtesy by them. Wherever we met them they silently raised their caps, or put up a hand in military salute. There were only two or three whose names we learned out of the crowd of seventy or eighty stationed there — the Majors orderly and one or two others but they all knew us and gave us the same courteous recognition as they tendered Mrs. Head, the Majors wife. Our pupils used to bring us the greatest profusion of the most beautiful flowers — so many that they actually constituted "an embarrassment of riches." I had so many one day that I left them in the school-room until one of my girls could get a basket to bring them over to me. When she came she said the soldiers at the barracks in the rear of the house tried to coax her to let them have some. "Please give me just one white flower." But she sternly refused. "They are all for Miss C" she told them. I told her I thought I might spare a few out of half a bushel, so I filled two or three vases and sent the rest down to them. If there was a sick soldier in the hospital we shared our flowers with him, and we often furnished the soldiers with enough to decorate the graves of the Union dead who rested in the University burying ground a half mile away. After the soldiers were gone we used to make little pilgrimages to the place with our own offering of flowers until the bodies were removed to the national cemetary at Culpepper. In the latter part of May of '66 we were told that orders had come for the troops to be removed from Charlottesville. The colored people were very much alarmed, and we felt that our position there would scarcely be secure without their protection, so with the approval of Maj. Head and the other teachers Miss Gardner went to Washington to appeal to the authorities there to allow the soldiers to remain awhile longer. They gave her request respectful consideration, but their final conclusion was that a guard was no longer necessary there, and on the morning of the 8th of June, a special train stood on the track about two rods in the rear of our home and we sat at the windows and watched the soldiers file on board. When all was ready for a start Miss G. said "We ought not let them go without a sign that we notice their departure" so we waved our handkerchiefs as the train moved off. Instantly the soldiers wavedswung their caps in return, and gave us three cheers. So ended my small experience of military life. We heard of many threats to break up our school after the soldiers left. I find in my diary of that date this significant item "They threaten to burn us out." but we went on with our work as if we had no thought of trouble, and it proved the wisest course, for the trouble did not come.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter Eighth Our teachers When Miss Anna Gardner was sent to Charlottesville in the autumn of '65 she found a school for colored children which had been opened by a Mr. Musgrove, a white citizen of the place. She reported the fact to the Society in Boston at once, and they as promptly offered to adopt his school and pay him a salary for his work. He was glad to accept their offer, as he had been teaching for such uncertain and meagre fees as the poor colored people could pay, and the change to sure and definite wages was naturally agreeable. He held the position of teacher for the Society but a short time, however. His methods of teaching the various branches required were not up to the standard, and the Committee felt that they could not afford to waste the funds of the Society; so he was removed to make way for one considered more satisfactory. We all regretted that the Committee were not willing to have given him a longer trial, as he had enlisted so promptly in the unpopular work of teaching the Freedmen. It seemed to us that a few timely hints as to methods and a little time given for opportunity to improve would have been both just and wise, and we made an appeal in his favor, but they seemed to feel that the welfare of the school depended upon the change, and so the change was made, and Mr. Musgrove no longer formed one of our corps of teachers. Miss Anna Gardner, the first teacher sent to Charlottesville by the Freedmens Aid Society organized the school in the autumn of '65. She was a native of Nantucket, and was a woman of middle age when I made her acquaintance. She was an old time abolitionist and had stood before furious pro-slavery mobs with Garrison, Phillips, Steven &amp; Abby Kelley Foster, Lydia Maria Child, and others of the famous anti-slavery people who fought the "sum of all villainies" in those never-to-be-forgotten years that preceded the Civil War. She was a Quaker by birth and education but she was a soldier by nature although her Quaker training made her deprecate bloodshed. But she was always ready to meet the foe in argument, and never hauled down her flag or sounded a retreat. She used to say that she was a physical coward, but she rightfully claimed that she was morally brave. For the first two or thee years of our work there she seemed to be in constant dread of danger from mobs, or secret assassins, but in spite of her fears she never hesitated to say or do the thing she thought ought to be said or done regardless of the irritation or anger it might cause among those who were opposed, both to our work and our presence among them. I think now it would have been wiser had she taken a more conciliatory tone in her dealings with a people who were sore from their recent struggle and defeat. But she was aggressive in the honesty of her opinions, and seemingly could not make allowance for the difference views held by her opponents. She was a most excellent teacher, never permitting a half understanding of any subject in her pupils. Every step must be made perfectly clear before the next was taken. When the school was fairly organized and graded she was placed at the head as Principal, a position she held for more than five years. The school at Charlottesville was not her first experience among the Freedmen. She had previously taught in New Berne N. C. and after leaving Charlottesville she taught some time in Elizabeth N. C. Her interest in the colored people had formed a part of her whole life. In 1838 when a very young woman, she opened a school for the colored children of Nantucket who were not then allowed public school privileges. She had a beautiful, heart-shaped gold medal which those pupils presented her, which was engraved with a statement of this fact. She had aided many poor fugitive slaves to escape by secreting them and in other ways assisting them to gain their freedom across the line in Canada. She told me that one of her first recollections was of a fugitive slave whom the man hunter had traced to her fathers house. She could never forget the contrast between his black skin and the ashy whiteness of his lips when he found they had come for him. Her father managed to get him out of an obscure rear window while the search was on, and other abolitionists aided his escape. She came of good old anti slavery stock One of her ancestors was the "Goodman Macy" of Whittiers poem. Mrs Phebe Ann Hanaford was her cousin, and she numbered among her friends most of the noted people of the day She wrote articles for various periodicals upon the burning questions of the times — Temperance, Anti-slavery — Woman Suffrage etc. Some of these with various poems, and other articles from her pen were gathered into a small volume called "Harvest Gleanings" not many years before she died. This work was done under the supervision of Mrs Hanaford When well along in years Miss Gardner met with a serious accident whichcrippled her for life. She attempted to rescue a child which had been thrown down in the street under the feet of a horse and her hip was broken in doing so. Miss Gardner lived beyond the four score mark and was bright and active to the end. We corresponded regularly for a number of years until her eyesight failed her, and after that occasional letters passed between us. She was one upon whose friendship I felt I could always rely. One who was never afraid to criticize my work, or disagree with me when she thought me in the wrong, and for that reason I came to feel that I could always learn the truth from her — the truth as she saw it, and I knew that a word of praise from her lips was of value for she never bestowed it to flatter ones vanity or win his good will. A good, brave, noble woman, who always did the thing that seemed right in her eyes. Another teacher from the north had preceded me by a few months — a young man from Newburyport Mass., Mr. Charles H. Woodman. It was a strange thing for the Society to do, particular as they usually werecareful not to send very young or inexperienced teachers into the field, that they should have made an exception of this wholly inexperienced and immature boy of eighteen years. Two circumstances evidently influenced them in his favor. He was enthusiastic in the cause, and had the warm friendship and admiration of an influential member of the Teachers Committee. He was a bright, intelligent well-meaninglad having a fair education, and doubtless entered into the work of teaching the Freedmen with the true missionary spirit, ready and willing to make sacrifices if need be in the cause. But he knew nothing of teaching and the position in which he found himself held many temptations for an immature young man, whose moral stamina had not become sufficiently strengthened by habits of self-control. He remained until the close of the school year at the end of June, but was not given a position again in Charlottesville or elsewhere. When I had been in Charlottesville about two months a change was made in one of the schools — Mr. Musgrove being removed and his school put in charge of Mr. John Wesley Pratt of Massachusetts who took charge of the school the latter part of April. As I remember Mr. Pratt I should say that he was upwards of forty years old at that time. He was a successful teacher but only remained in C. until the end of the school year, as the Committee thought it best to put some of the more advanced of the colored pupils in charge of the Primary classes, so Mr. Pratt, with his wife and young son were sent to Orange Court House, Va where they taught for some time — I do not now remember how long, but probably as long as the Society continued to support a school in that place. The next teacher to assume her duties under the auspices of the Society was a native colored woman, Mrs Isabella Gibbons. I think she opened her school in the fall of 1866. Her husband was a Baptist preacher of a great deal of untutored power and eloquence. They had both been slaves and were especially happy to be free, as they had a large family of children for whose welfare they were naturally anxious. Mrs. Gibbons was a handsome, capable woman, some thirty-five years old. She made an excellent teacher. She was one of the colored people who had rendered much aid to sick and wounded Union prisoners lodged in the hospitals around Charlottesville. She continued in the work during my stay there, and for several years after I came away, being employed by the local school board. In February 1867 a colored man Paul Lewis, who like Mrs. Gibbons, was one of Miss Gardners pupils was placed in charge of another school of the same grade as that of Mrs. Gibbons. Both of these teachers were given positions with the understanding that they should continue their studies while teaching. Paul Lewis was a slave of Hon. Alexander Rives. His mother was the nurse of Mr. Rives children. He was wholly unlike Mrs. Gibbons who was very quick and bright. Paul was slow, but deep. He made a good teacher, adopting Miss Gardners methods of instruction, and drilling his pupils very thoroughly. He continued in the work for a year or two after I left, and then owing to some trouble he had with a white resident, he lost his position as teacher, and resumed his old trade of shoe making. In 1871 Miss Gardner thinking it best to make a change, resigned her position as Principal of the school at Charlottesville and I was promoted to fill the place. Miss Annie D. Holmes of Chelsea Mass. was elected to the position made vacant by my promotion. Miss Holmes had already had a large experience as teacher among the Freedmen. She had taught on the South Carolina islands, and in Columbus and Jonesboro Ga. and Gordonsville Va. and brought to the work in Charlottesville all the advantages gained from that experience, as well as her natural intelligence and enthusiasm for the work. She possessed the gift of winning the confidence and affection of her pupils in a marked degree. She was very independent in her views and actions, and set about rectifying what seemed wrong in her eyes with absolute fearlessness as regarded consequences. Our relations were of the pleasantest nature, and I felt the deepest regret when, at the end of two years, the Society in Boston decided to withdraw her from Charlottesville and put her to work elsewhere. This was in accordance with the rule they had made of gradually dropping their work into the hands of the local school-boards. Miss Holmes went again to Georgia, and I was left the only white teacher in the school where I remained two years longer. But our friendship has survived more than thirty years of separation fed by the remembrance of our work together, and by occasional meetings and an irregular correspondence. The isolated northern teachers felt for each other something of the comradeship that soldiers feel for their companions in march and battle. We were, in a sense in the enemys country, and looked to each other for companionship and support amid trials which it would be difficult for the uninitiated to understand, because only those who have lived the life can know the brightness of its sunshine or the darkness of its clouds. But however black the clouds might sometime hover I do not believe there is a surviving teacher of that period who would say the she was sorry she had been given the opportunity to taste the bitter as well as the sweet of the life of a teacher among the Freedmen. See "Left Overs. Chap</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter Ninth Our Schools When I went to Charlottesville in the spring of 1866, the various schools that had been opened for the benefit of the Freedmen were wholly independent of each other. Each teacher admitted as many pupils as he or she could accommodate without regard to educational qualifications: for in spite of the fact that it was unlawful in Virginia to teach a slave to read, many of them had tasted the forbidden fruit in one way or another, so there was quite a material difference in the attainments of the applicants for admission to the "free schools" as ours were called by the colored people. Miss Gardner had been quick to recognize the necessity of better organization and placed the matter before the committee. The result was that I was sent to take charge of the pupils collected under her care, with the exception of thirty of the more advanced who remained with her, forming the nucleus of what was later styled the High &amp; Normal department of the school. In addition to the thirty or forty pupils that came under my care from Miss Gardners room I admitted a sufficient number of outsiders to increase my number to seventy or more. A year or so later the schools were systematically graded — two rooms being devoted to the Primary department, from which the pupils graduated into the Grammar School and from there to the High School. It must be explained here that the status of this school was not the same as that of a High School in one of our northern cities or towns. As a High School it was simply a dream of the future, but the object was to make it a reality as speedily as possible. The branches taught in this grade were Reading, Writing, Arithmetic, Grammar with composition, Geography, Natural Philosophy History, a little geology etc. etc. It was necessary that the languages, higher mathematics etc should wait until the pupils thoroughly understood those branches which would be of most importance in their every day lives. So the branches taught in the two upper grades differed less in kind than in degree. The pupils in the Primary department learned to read write and spell and were grounded in the rudements of Geography and Arithmetic. The two teachers in this department — Mrs. Gibbons and Mr. Lewis followed the methods of Miss Gardner by whom they had been themselves instructed, so their classes always entered the Grammar School well fitted to take up the work which was expected of them there. As years passed, the grades advanced somewhat, but owing to the difficulties of the situation, the schools could not in the few years we spent there be raised to the level of the same grade in the North, but the few branches studied were thoroughly understood not only as regarded the facts themselves but the causes undelying those facts We found the colored people were naturallydramatic and many of them had beautifully soft and clear voices so they were easily taught to be fine readers and speakers. Aside from this they were, like pupils everywhere, some proficient in one branch, some in another, and some seemingly mere dullards, although we avoided as far as possible admitting pupils of the latter class, as it would have been a waste of our time and the means of the Society to to give instruction to such when those of better ability were waiting to be taught. We were supposed to give our time to such as would be useful in the uplifting of the race. The dull ones were not to be neglected in the end, but our first object was to push the bright adult pupils forward as rapidly as possible that they might serve as teachers for others younger or less brilliant. In the early years of our work there it was suggested that each teacher give a name to his or her school. Miss Gardner was a great admirer of Thomas Jefferson so her schoolwas named for him. In tender remembrance of our recently martyred President mine was called the "Lincoln School" The primary school under Mrs. Gibbons was called the "Major Savage School in honor of a Union officer who died a prisoner in Charlottesville and whose remains were interred in the cemetary just beyond the buildings of the University of Virginia. The Primary school taught by Paul Lewis was called the John Brown school after the hero of Harpers Ferry. When the new school house was built it was named "The Jefferson School" as it had now become one school of three grades with a Principal and sub-teachers. Our school hours were from 9 A. M. until 12, and from 1 to 4 P. M. every week day except Saturday Our holidays were Thanksgiving Day, Christmas week, the Monday after Easter, and the Monday after Whitsuntide. The Christmas holidays included New Years, or Emancipation Day. Many of our pupils came long distances — from two or three to five or six miles to school I remember one boy of 18 or 19 year who lived five miles away, and attended school regularly although he had to earn his living by working at his trade — shoemaking — in the evening He told me after he left school that he hardly knew how he lived at the time. There were many others who made a similar struggle in order to enjoy the privilege of attending school. To them the old adage "Knowledge is Power" was full of meaning, and they felt its truth in all its intensity. They felt that the power of their white superiors lay in the education that had been denied them, so they feltthought that no labor was too arduous and no sacrifice too great, so that they might drink of the cup held out to them by their friends at the North. The colored people are naturally very musical and our school exercises were usually opened and closed with singing. The songs were various in their nature. Sunday school hymns. Temperance songs and songs born of the events of the Civil War were the most common. Mrs. Howes "Battle Hymn of the Republic" was a favorite. For special occasions we wrote the words of songs which were adapted to well known tunes. It was a pleasure to do this, they all seemed so pleased with a song prepared expressly for them Miss Gardner and I each fitted words to the once familiar tune "Kingdom Come" and many other popular tunes were made to bear similar burdens. I don't know how it happened that the old plantation hymns were never sung in our schools. Perhaps they carried with them too strong a savor of the old slave days. However that might be, some of our pupils in after years travelled the world over singing these old slave melodies before vast crowds of enthusiastic listeners. It would be hard for one educated in our public schools to understand the confusedideas many of the freed people entertained concerning the relation of cities and towns to the States — in regard to historical facts and many other circumstances. I happened to mention one day that I came from Massachusetts. "Is Massachusetts in Boston?" queried one of my pupils. In the minds of some of these people, Boston meant the whole North. All their hopes seemed centered in this great, all-embracing Boston. I will relate another little circumstance which will give an idea of their hazy views in regard to historical facts. One day in our reading we came upon something relating to Bunker Hill so I told them about the great battle that was fought there is 1779. "Where you there?" Do you remember about it?" were the questions asked. To their minds all wars were included in the Civil War which meant so much to them. At another time I was explaining the lines on the map of the earths surface to a class in Geography. I was careful to speak of them as imaginary lines, but the adjective evidently did not impress itself upon their minds as it should have done for at the end of the lesson one boy remarked that he should think that "ships at sea would get all tangled up in the equator." These incidents will serve to show that we had to begin at the very bottom of every subject taught. Even the common, ordinary words we used in explanation of facts often conveyed a different meaning to their minds from that intended. The first day I taught in school I dismissed them for the noon day recess at twelve o-clock. "Shall you have school this evening?" they asked. "No" said I "There will be no school in the evening." At one o-clock I rang the bell, and about a dozen or fifteen pupils straggled in. "Where are all the others?" said I. "They said you wouldn't have school this evening." was the reply. So I learned the meaning of the word "evening" as they understood it. One day when two or three women — parents of some of the pupils — were calling on us, the conversation turned upon a boy who had many very peculiar traits, and I happened to remark that he was a "great rogue." They seemed mush shocked and one of them said that she "never thought that of him." I assured her that "I didn't mind it at all." In fact "I rather liked a rogue." This was more shocking still until Miss Gardner, who was quietly laughing to herself, said, "They think you mean a thief." and explained to them the different meaning we gave the word in the North. So my reputation was saved from the stigma of encouraging a thief. The work of taking care of the schoolrooms was performed by the pupils under the supervision of the teachers. The girls did the daily sweeping and dusting, and the boys cut the wood, and made the fires. When there was a regular cleaning up the boys and girls were both pressed into service. Occasionally some of the older boys would do a little job of carpenter work, or other repairing, like setting panes of glass or fixing a refractory lock, rehanging a door etc. The text books used in the school were shipped to us from the rooms of the Society in Boston and sold to the pupils as needed, the money thus received being credited to the Society as such a part of our wages. After the Society co-operated with the local school board the text books of the State of Virginia were introduced into those departments that fell under their supervision. Very soon after I began teaching in 1866 I opened an evening school for adults holding a two hour session three evenings in a week. I kept this up for about two years until we had trained some of the more advanced pupils to take up work of this kind. In this class I had pupils from twenty to more than sixty years of age. The very oldest attempted nothing beyond reading and writing, but many of those of forty years and under made remarkable progress. One woman who did laundry work told me she kept her books on her ironing table and learned her lessons while she worked, and nearly all these adult pupils found it necessary to pursue their studies under similar difficulties. But they were in earnest and determined to overcome all obstacles. I remember when I reached home one summer, I found a letter awaiting me which had anticipated my arrival by a day. This letter was from one of my evening pupils — a woman named Johnson, who, six weeks before could not form a single letter with her pen. It was a wonderful satisfaction to her to be able to send me the first letter I received from the South during my summer vacation. It will be readily understood that there wasn't time in the few brief hours I could devote to this evening class to give instruction in many branches. I taught them to read, spell and write, and they learned the rudiments of Arithmetic. Some of the brightest pupils became quite proficient in the latter branch through decimal fractions. This seems a very meagre education but it meant much to them, and they showed that they appreciated my efforts to help them in every way they could. Their efforts to show their devotion to us were often pathetic in their eagerness. They blossomed out in the form of gifts of articles, which they thought would please us, and which we often felt they could ill afford. We were the recipients of numerous pieces of gaily decorated china ware — cups and saucers, plates, vases, mugs etc. and sometimes articles in silver were given us. Now and then some one would select a book or picture as an offering. Flowers and fruits were showered upon us in their season and the amount of cooked food that was brought us at certain times would have enabled us to set up a boarding house. I had a rough table which must have been at least seven feet by three, and I now recall one Christmas when it was loaded with food from end to end. Chickens fried and roasted boiled ham, roast pig (or shote as they called it) baked fish, oysters, salads, sweet and white potatoes squashes, parsnips, turnips, onions, cabbage, apples, oranges, bananas, grapes, raisins figs, dates nuts pies, cake, blanc-mange, custards, bread, rolls, crisp little short biscuits, and the delicious Virginia Sally Lunns, with plenty of candy to sweeten us up. Nor did they show their devotion to us in gifts alone. They got up feasts, and picnics, and barbecues and every kind of entertainment in their power for our amusement, and frequently some of the young men who owned musical instruments would bring their violins or guitars and give us an evening seranade. Each summer when we left for our annual vacation early in July they bade us God speed with sad faces and many tears, and they welcomed our advent in late September with many demonstrations of joy It may be true that as a race these people are apt to be careless and thoughtless, but I can testify that they were ever thoughtful for us, and spared no pains to make our life among them as pleasant as it lay in their power to do. As every circumstance of our lives in Charlottesville was in some way connected with our school work it is not necessary to give further special attention to this subject.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter Tenth Entertainments As the colored people were not permitted to share in the amusements of the whites except in a manner to emphasize the fact of their degradation we felt it incumbent upon us to have some sort of entertainment of a moral and educational character, which should serve both to instruct and amuse; and the most available plan at first was the School Exhibition in which songs, recitations and dialogues formed the whole of the program. These were all carefully selected by ourselves, and each pupil given the part best adapted to his ability. Miss Gardner, as Principal was the first to bring out her pupils in this way, and the other schools followed in succession, so that the School Exhibition came to be looked forward to by the pupils as an agreeable change from the ordinary routine of school work. Miss Gardner also originated the idea of a Masquerade party, and we selected all the characters and planned the costumes for the maskers. In all these entertainments we were greatly assisted by two of the most prominent colored men in the town — Messrs Robert and James Scott, brothers, who with the son of the former, Robert Scott Jr. furnished us with the best music the town afforded. The Scotts were noted musicians, and their services were in demand in the most aristocratic families of Charlottesville After I became Principal of the school, I formed among my pupils the "Jefferson Amateur Dramatic Association." Our plays dealt largely with the question of intemperance, as the drinking habit was so common among both the white and colored people of the place. If my memory serves me rightly "Ten Nights in a Bar-room was the most pretentious piece we put upon the boards. "Bakers Temperance Dramas" furnished us several "The Little Brown Jug" "The Last Loaf" "Man with a Demijohn." "Seeing the Elephant." "We're all Teetotallers" etc. I also remember one called "Aunt Dinahs Pledge" which I picked up somewhere and I also found plays on other subjects suited to our needs. We usually charged an admission fee of 15 cts and we always had a few white people in the audience. It would give a real actor spasms to look over our stage properties. For instance, in the scene in the wood or grove in "Ten Nights in a Bar-room" small evergreen trees were made to stand on the stage through which the actors skulked in and out as necessary. For the Bar Room a long wooden table was arranged with glasses, bottles, etc. to resemble a bar. In "Seeing the Elephant," the huge beast was made of two boys, two paper cones, and a grey blanket. Where money was required Confederate bills of which plenty could be obtained at that time, were used We also had entertainments consisting of tableaux charades etc, and we occasionally consented to the pupils holding a Fair for some special school purpose. All the money r`aised through the different entertainments was used for some special school purpose We also formed Societies for various purposes. A "Freedmens Aid Society" as a branch to the one in Boston, "A "Mutual Improvement Society" A "Union League." The "Cheney Society" The "Equal Rights Association" The "Gardner Society" etc. These did not all exist at the same time, but were formed when occasion for some new organization seemed apparent and disbanded when the object was attained or seemed no longer desirable. Sometimes one organization became merged in another of a different name but similar nature. The colored people often prepared entertainments for our especial benefit. Sometimes it was a picnic or a barbecue — sometimes a feast at one of their houses. When it became a matter of preparing good things to eat, there was never any lack either in quantity or quality. It was a matter of regret to us that these poor people should so strain the small means at their disposal to make a feast for us, but, the cost incurred, there was nothing for us to do but to show our appreciation of their efforts by enjoying the same. I have mentioned in a previous chapter that we were frequently treated to a serenade in the evening At Christmas we usually had a tree with gifts for all our pupils. These gifts were sent to each school by the special branch society actively interested in its welfare and consisted of books, pictures, clothing, handkerchiefs and other articles of use orfor ornament. I will describe one Christmas festival which was a little out of the ordinary. That year our branch society failed to send articles suitable for a tree in sufficient number to supply more than twenty or thirty of my seventy odd pupils. I explained the matter to them and asked if they were willing that the contents of the box should be distributed among the very poor to which they readily consented. I then arranged a program for a little festival on Christmas eve in which the exercises were to be singing, reading etc. A few days later Miss Gardners society sent her an enormous box, with special gifts marked for each of her pupils, besides a vast number of other nice things: and she generously offered me enough to put with the few suitable articles I already had to make a nice gift for each member of my school. As they expected nothing I planned a little surprise for them, and arranged with one of Miss Gardners older boys to act the part of Santa Claus itbeing difficult to procure a sledge, with the proper supply of reindeer, I had a barrel filled with the gifts neatly done up and marked. This was placed on a wheelbarrow in the room back of the school room, while we went through the exercises of the evening as planned. When we were all through with the exception of the closing song, I made a little speech in which I told them that without doubt Santa Claus appreciated their unselfishness in donating their Christmas gifts to those more needy than themselves, and as he was probably riding about that evening if we could hail him in passing he might possibly be induced to make us a call. Two of the older girls were appointed to look for him. By this time the interest and curiosity of the pupils was at its height, and they watched with eager eyes as one of the girls opened the stove door, and called "Santa Claus! Santa Claus!" There was no response and I told them the stove pipe was probably too small for him to come through with his pack so they had better try the door. They opened the door into the hall and repeated the call but in vain. Then they went to the back door and called. Immediately a figure with a long white beard and clad in furs pushing a wheel-barrow in front of him passed through the aisle and stationed itself in the open space before the platform. What a moment of excitement followed! They jumped up and down and clapped their hands, and cheered and shouted until it was a perfect pandemonium and it took some time for them to subdue their emotions sufficiently to enable us to proceed with the distribution of the gifts. The surprise was perfect, and the value of the simple gifts correspondingly heightened. As a rule our Christmas entertainments consisted of recitations, singing, and a tree and we usually had some kind of a celebration on Jan.1st Emancipation Day and on several occasions we combined the two, postponing our Christmas festival a week. Christmas had always been the greatest day of the year with the colored people, whether bond or free, but we did what we could to teach them, the importance to themselves, of Emancipation Day. On April 19th 1875we celebrated the day by reading the story of the "Concord Fight" and many other entertaining bits of history of Revolutionary days, and the singing of patriotic songs, with speeches by their friends who came to witness the exercises etc so while Massachusetts towns were rejoicing with elaborate festivities we had our humble celebration six hundred miles away. There were other entertainments as the dedication of a new school house we had built — a festival of the "Equal Rights Association" and many occasions of a pleasant nature that are only vaguely remembered now, but in every instance whatever the occasion we always tried to so manage the affair that it would instruct as well as amuse.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter Eleventh Religious Revivals, Etc One of the greatest difficulties we had to contend with in our work was the occasional spell of madness which would attack the chief part of the community of colored people, called a religious revival. When the frenzy was at its height, all sense of responsibility in other matters became second to the one idea of saving souls. Meetings would be held every night far into the small hours of the morning, where, not only men and women, but even little children, many not more than five or six years old, would be exhorted and prayed for, until frightened and excited, they would be led trembling and crying to the "mourners bench." Not infrequently they would seem to fall in fits, and roll upon the floor, groaning and praying; the more ignorant the subject, the greater and more wonderful were the manifestations of a new birth. Then would follow days of "mourning," when a subject of these attacks would go about mechanically with sober face speaking to no one except to answer a question or respond to a salute, and cowering by himself in some secluded spot whenever possible. This might go on for several days, or possibly two or three weeks, and then he would proclaim his conversion to the world, and relate the wonderful experience through which he had passed. Now he had "found Jesus," and was "born again" — in short, he had become a "Christian." Our pupils who became victims of the prevailing mania, would lose all interest in their studies, and possibly give up school entirely for a time, until the heat of the spiritual contest was over, when most of them would return to us, anxious to be installed in their old positions as pupils, and some of them rather ashamed of the figure they cut during the time of excitement. Before many weeks had passed, the bountiful harvest of converts would be much reduced by many backsliders. A very honest and intelligent young woman related to me the circumstances connected with her conversion. She was talking with several other girls who had passed through truly wonderful experiences. This girl — Margaret — was of a naturally serious turn of mind, and anxious to attain the highest spiritual good through any source that offered opportunity and she tried to make her companions understand her feelings in this matter but with their minds so full of their own crude ideas of what religion meant they failed utterly to comprehend her views, and put their own construction upon her efforts to explain. "O, you have found Jesus!" "Maggie's done got religion!" etc were the exclamations that greeted her remarks. She was dazed, and excited and submitted to be led by them to the "mourners bench" and finally taken into the fold as a "lamb of God:" but she always felt there was a mistake, because her quiet desire for spiritual good seemed so different from the wonderful experiences she had heard related by others. The great mass of the colored people held very unique views as to what constituted religion. It seemed to be a subtle something which elevated its subject to the dignity of a "child of God," without in the least affecting his moral attitude towards his fellow men. There were certain acts in life which were considered sinful if committed by a member of the church, although they could bring no harm to to the unconverted as they were already as deep as possible under the "wrath of God," and no act of theirs couldpossibly make them more vile than they were by nature. All kinds of games were forbidden to church members, so was the singing of secular songs, but religion had nothing to do with morals. A pure, upright, honest life was not considered a necessary part of the spiritual outfit of a Christian. As is the case with most rules, this one had its exceptions, and the more intelligence became disseminated among them, the more numerous became the exceptions. The whole idea of a religious revival among the Freedmen at the time of our work there could be summed up in the phrase Spiritual intoxication." Singing seems as natural to the negro as to the birds and all their religious exercises were varied and enlivened by Gospel Hymns, and the old plantation melodies. These latter are of unknown origin and seem to have sprung involuntarily from the brains of (shall we say?) possible poets. The words were usually a fervent invocation, and the music of a weird nature. I recall very little of them now only the chorus of one here and there, as Roll, Jordan roll! Roll, Jordan roll! I want to go to heaven when I die, To hear Jordan roll. or Swing Low sweet chariot, I'm going for to carry me home. These plantation songs became very popular from about 1870 for about ten years or so, and some of my old pupils travelled to distant lands giving concerts consisting almost wholly of these curious musical waifs. There were other songs written by white people often spoken of as "Negro Melodies": such as "Suwanee River," "Old Kentucky Home," "Nellie Grey," "Old Black Joe," and others, which were familiar to our ears about the middle of the 19th century. I remember one autumn evening in Virginia hearing a peculiar and monotonous kind of singing in the distance, and asked my serving woman what it was. "O." said she "Thats a corn song. Somebody's having a corn shucking, and the men are singing the corn song." She went on to explain that when some farmer had his corn ready to be husked it was made into a huge pile out of doors, and a few men set to work "shucking" and singing the corn song. As whiskey was always liberally served on such occasions, men and boys who heard the singing would follow the sound as the rats followed the music of the Pied Piper of Hamlin. Each one as he arrived on the scene, lent a hand to the shucking and a voice to the corn song, to say nothing of a thirsty throat to the whiskey. In this way the corn would be quickly undressed with no expense to the owner except the juice of some cheap whiskey. Returning to the subject of religion most of the Freedmen about Charlottesville professed the Baptist faith, and supported two churches, the 1st and 2d Baptist. There were also some Methodists — enough to form a small society, which was presided over by a very ignorant colored man, well stocked with piety but sadly lacking in moral qualities. In the earlier years of our life among these people, the ministers who were supposed to proclaim the word of God from the desks of the two Baptist churches were much like their Methodist brother in character, but sometime in the early seventies, each of these churches secured the services of a young man of good moral character and fair education. As the lives of the church members were so much under the influence of their minister, it was quite a step in the right direction for them to secure religious leaders who really influenced them for their good, and consequently no little help and encouragement to us as one can readily believe. In the celebration of marriages and the conduct of funerals, the ex-slaves took their cue from the white people, and aped their manners, and style of dress etc. as far as they were able. They often spent large sums which they could ill afford, to procure the clothing and food they considered necessary for a reasonable display on such occasions, and perhaps, nearly starved for weeks afterward to make up for the unusual outlay: but, perhaps, in this they were no worse than many people of whiter skins, and a better opportunity to judge between what is necessary and proper, and what is simply foolish extravagance. One of the superstitions of the more ignorant of these people was the fear of being "conjured" which meant the same as what is more commonly called "hoo-dooed." Whether the belief in this peculiar form of the black art was common among the people of Charlottesville I am unable to say, as I seldom heard the subject mentioned except now and then among our pupils as a matter for a joke; but enough was said to show that there were some who believed that evil minded persons could often exercise some supernatural power for ill over those who were so unfortunate as to offend them. The ex-slaves were every whit as fond of creature comforts as their white neighbors. "Good eatings" and warm rooms were very essential to their happiness. Good, well-fitting clothes were also necessary to the more intelligent, while cheap finery and gew-gaws filled all the requirements in this line for those of a less intelligent sense of the fitness of things. Many of the colored women and girls would wind pieces of twine around locks of their woolly hair making it stand up all over their heads like little tails. The process was called "wrapping" and was done to straighten it in a measure and really served to take out some of the kink, so that on dress occasions they could arrange their locks more after the manner of white people. With a wonderful intuition as to what was becoming in dress, those of very dark skins usually affected bright colors — reds and yellows predominating — while those of lighter or very fair complexions were apt to select softer shades of color. However the style and color of their dresses werewas not always a matter of choice with them, as some poor creatures never knew what it was to have an article of clothing made expressly for them, but had to consider themselves happy if made comfortable in the cast of apparel of others more fortunate, and in such cases the question of color was necessarily second to the greater question of comfort. Any thoughtful, unprejudiced person could not have lived among these people very long, without percieving that all the seeming absurdities in dress, religion etc. were the efforts of a people to adapt themselves as best they could to the circumstances by which they were surrounded, and a reaching out for "something better than they had known."</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter Twelfth Incidents of Travel In looking over old diaries, I find, under date of July 8th 1867this item. "On my way from Virginia I rode from Washington to New York in the car with Gen. &amp; Mrs. Grant." This was the only time I ever saw Gen. Grant except on the day of his inauguration March 4th 1869. At that time I had been teaching in Charlottesville three years, and went to Washington accompanied by Mrs. Isabella Gibbons one of our colored teachers. Her husband was a Baptist preacher and presided over a church in that city, so, through him we secured accommodations for a few days. I did not attempt to witness the inauguration ceremonies but saw the procession from the Treasury Building from which spot I waved my handkerchief to the incoming President in return for the bow with which he saluted the group assembled there. After the procession, (which was very long) had passed, we went to the Capitol, and Mr. Gibbons who was familiar with every part of it, took us well over the vast structure. Although I had seen the main part of the building before, I had not been in the basement, so this was quite a revelation to me with its restaurants, barber shops etc etc. Returning to the main floor, Mr. G. espied a page hastening towards the Senate Chamber with a message. Said he "That boy has a list of the names of the new Presidents Cabinet. We'll see who they are." saying which he stopped the page and asked to see the list. So we got ahead of the U. S. Senate that time. We went on to the Senate Chamber, however, and heard the names read to that august body. I stayed in Washington three or four days at that time, and while there heard "Blind Tom" the musical wonder, visited Charles Sumners house, the navy yard Smithsonian Institute and other places of interest. This was not my first visit in Washington, however, as in July 1867Miss Gardner and I stopped over for a day, on our way to Charlottesville at the Hotel of Mr. Joy corner of 8th St and Pennsylvania Ave. Mr. Joy was a Massachusetts man, and upon learning that we were Freedmen's teachers exerted himself to make our visit there pleasant. He introduced us to Mr. &amp; Mrs. John Jolliffe. Mr. Jolliffe was a Virginia lawyer, a Quaker by birth, and an old time abolitionist. He was the lawyer who defended Margaret Garner, the slave mother who killed her two little daughters to save them from the fate she knew awaited them in slavery. He was very much interested in our work, and opened a correspondence with us in regard to it. He had a good deal of influence in Washington, and offered to get us positions in the schools there, or if we preferred, in some of the departments, but we were too much interested in our work in Virginia to consider any other position however advantageous it might be. Mr. Jolliffe died, at an advanced age, a year or two later, and was followed to his grave by a procession which included a large part of the colored population of the city. It was on the visit above mentioned that I had the good fortune to meet a young gentleman from Boston whose name I have most ungratefully forgotten, but who acted as my escort to all the principal places of interest in the city, and it was with him that I made my first ascent up the dome of the Capitol — a feat I accomplished two or three times afterward. He took me around to Fords Theatre where President Lincoln was shot, and pointed out the house where he died, as well showing me the Patent Office, Smithsonian Institute and Treasury Building. We stopped at Mr. Joys once more — the following year I think — and went into both Houses of Congress which was in session at the time. I remember hearing Charles Sumner say a few earnest words, but do not now recall the matter under discussion. I saw Ben Butler in the House. The relations between President Johnson and the Congress were very much strained at the time. Miss G. and I wished very much to attend one of the receptions at the White House, but our feelings toward Mr. Johnson were none too kindly and we could not make up our minds to shake hands with him, while we would not commit so unpardonable a breach of good manners as to follow the example of some who, we were told, deliberately insulted the President by refusing his proffered hand when introduced. No act of his could be an excuse for such discourtesy for no one, unconnected with affairs of the government was compelled to meet him. He undoubtedly acted up to his own idea of what was right, and should at least, have been accorded the consideration due to the President when met at a public reception. I have always regretted that I never took the trip to Mt. Vernon which I could easily have done by stopping over an extra day in Washington, but I postponed it from time to time until the opportunity slipped away, as opportunities have a habit of doing unless we seize them as they halt before us. Early in 1868 a Convention for the purpose of framing a new State Constitution preparatory to readmission to the Union was held at Richmond Two delegates — both Republican — were sent from Charlottesville. Mr. Thompson, white, a printer, and an old friend of Garrison, and James T. S. Taylor, colored — a former pupil in my night school. Naturally Miss Gardner and I were much interested in the work of this Convention, so on Feb. 27th we went down to Richmond for a few days. Mr. Thompson secured board for us at the Monticello House where he was staying. He with a friend of his, also a delegate, met us at the station, and asked us if we would like to attend a political meeting to be held that evening in the Convention hall at the Capital. Judge Rives of Charlottesville Mr. Underwood, and John Minor Botts were to be the principal speakers. Of course we accepted the invitation gladly. After supper Mr. Thompson came to us and said that he had learned that there would probably be no ladies present, and possibly we would not care to go under such circumstances but Miss Gardner assured him it would make no difference to her, if he and his friend did not object to taking us there. Of course they professed to be more than willing, and equally of course, I felt all right to follow Miss Gardners lead, so we went and listened to bright and witty speeches from Mr. Underwood and Mr. Botts, and an exceedingly eloquent and delightful one from Judge Rives. There was just one other lady present on that occasion, the wife of one of the delegates. We felt that she was probably glad that we were there to keep her in countenance, although she was, probably, like ourselves too independent to mind it much. There was one other delegate with whom we had a slight acquaintance — Lieut. Fred. Poor from Gordonsville. He recognized us and came from his place in the hall to greet us. We enjoyed the speeches much, and were very glad we went. On the following day we visited the school taught by Miss Bessie Canedy, who was an old friend of Miss Gardners and in the afternoon we attended the Convention at the Capital. Feb 29th we visited Libby Prison, attended the Convention, and called at the Teachers Home. In the Home were some with whom we had become acquainted, viz Miss Abby Francis of Cambridge, a niece of Lydia Maria Child, and the Misses Ball and Miss Harriet Buttrick of Concord. March 1st Sunday. Attended Jeff Davis' church (Episcopal) in the morning and dined at the Teachers Home by invitation March 2d Went out to Gambill Hill, visited several schools, and attended the Convention. This wound up our trip to Richmond as we returned to Charlottesville the following day. I had an interesting experience beginning with Sept. 29th 1870. I was on my way to Charlottesville, and when the train left Washington that morning it was raining heavily. Occupying the seat with me was a refined appearing lady of seventy odd years, whom I afterwards learned was Mrs. Mary S. Livermore of Cambridge. Travelling in company with her were Mrs Lewis, a young woman from Tennessee, with her little son six years old. Mrs. Lewis had been visiting in the North, and Mrs Livermore was going on to spend the winter with her. I learned these facts from the conversation that passed between the two ladies, as Mrs Lewis and her son sat directly in front of us The rain continued to fall in torrents through the forenoon. We reached Gordonsville about mid-day, where trains usually halted half an hour or so for lunch. But the half hour extended to an hour — two hours — and other trains arrived — this being a junction — and still we stayed on. Finally the word got round among the passengers that there was a great flood on the streams ahead of us, and the bridges were either unsafe or entirely swept away. There was nothing to do but to make the best of it, and the passengers who did not care to leave the train for the hotel, resorted to all sorts of expedients to make themselves comfort able for the night. Whenever the harrassed conductor came into the car he was besieged with questions which he was unable to answer satisfactorily, and the hotels were besieged by hungry travellers for food, which it strained their resources to provide. There was a terrible onslaught made upon the poultry yards to appease the appetites of so many hungry people. Happily for me, I had plenty of food still in my lunch basket, which I shared with Mrs. Livermore and her companions. We made acquaintance rapidly under the unusual circumstances, and Mrs. Livermore became a lifelong friend. The train remained stalled there that night, and until late in the afternoon of the following day when it moved on about sixteen miles to a small place called Shadwell which was only four miles from Charlottesville, but between us and my destination two bridges had been swept away — the one across the Rivanna river, which we struck at Shadwell and the one across Moores Creek near Charlottesville. The Rivanna, usually a tiny stream, which could, at times be crossed in some place on the stones in its bed, was now a raging, seething torrent. As it was impossible to proceed with the train, it was decided to take it back to Washington. Previous to this, however, the conductor had returned to me the last coupon of my ticket, saying he thought it unlikely that he should be able to see me through to my destination I still keep it as a souvenir of that memorable journey. In the meantime I had learned from the conversation I could not avoid hearing that passed between Mrs. Livermore and Mrs. Lewis that they were without money to meet such an emergency as we had met. They had through tickets and their baggage was expressed through, and Mrs. Livermore had her bank books, and some jewelry of value, but they had less than five dollars in money between them. Mrs. Livermore was a feeble old lady, and Mrs. Lewis was in no condition to travel contend with extra hardships in travelling being within a month of her confinement. Fortunately I had a good supply of money with me as the Society in Boston had advanced me two months salary besides my traveling expenses, so I had over a hundred dollars on hand, therefore I offered them the loan of ten dollars, which they gratefully accepted. I also invited them to stop with me in Charlottesville when we got there until they could resume their journey, for we soon learned that the flood was quite extensive and travel by rail between us and Tennessee was impossible, so they were very glad to accept the offer of a shelter under my roof, and when it was announced that the train was to return to Washington, Mrs. Livermore went out to a near by house and asked the woman who occupied it if she could keep us over night which she readily consented to do; so we took up our hand baggage consisting of traveling bags lunch baskets, wraps and a basket containing pots of small plants which Mrs. Lewis was taking home with her. Our exodus was not unnoticed, for soon four gentlemen put in an appearance and asked for lodging. Our hostess evidently considered it the part of wisdom to "make hay while the sun shines" so she agreed to take them. The establishment was not a large one. The main house consisted of two good sized square rooms in the rear of which was the kitchen, separate from the house as was usual at that time in Virginia. Our hostess with the help of a colored girl prepared us a very good and substantial supper, which, if I remember rightly we ate in the kitchen, and then came the preparations for the night. The four gentlemen occupied what I suppose was the living room, camping as best they could on the floor. In the other room was one old fashioned ordinary bed, which Mrs. Livermore, Mrs. Lewis and myself were told we were to occupy. We partially undressed and threw ourselves upon it crosswise. On a low chest was made a fairly comfortable pallet for Mrs. Lewis little boy. Our hostess had five children of her own. She reserved a trundle-bed, which she drew from beneath the larger bed, for herself and her youngest child. For the others she would throw down a mat or a woolen garment, and point to one of the other four to lie down upon it. Each one would obediently curl himself upon the spot indicated by her gesture, and all of them remained quiet through the night, as I can testify for I slept very little myself. The comical side of the position in which we found ourselves presented itself with so much force that I was shaking with smothered laughter a good part of the night. It was so ludicrous — ten of us in one moderate-sized room spread about very much like sheep in a pen — a most unique experience, and as I was young and well, and not far from my destination I could enjoy the strangeness of it all, but I doubt if it seemed as funny to Mrs. Livermore and her friend with no money, and still a long journey before them. In the morning we had our breakfast and settled with our hostess, and then looked over the situation. The river had settled a little, but was still a whirling mass of water. The four gentlemen had disappeared, and we were told they had crossed the river. I said if they could get across we could do the same, so we applied to a colored man who had a boat to take us over. He agreed to take us one at a time but would not attempt to carry us all at once. I went first, and when well out in the stream the boat got pretty giddy; but I was landed safely in a tobacco field, which the day before had been under water. Anyone acquainted with the nature of Virginia soil, will understand the luxurious softness of the ground beneath our feet after we were all safely landed. We made tracks — and pretty deep ones too — for the nearest house which belonged to a well-to-do gentleman named Smith, where, we had been told we might procure horses to take us to Moores Creek. We were kindly received and urged to remain until we could proceed on our journey in comfort, but I was too near home to be contented to stay and my companions were as eager as myself to get on to Charlottesville, so Mr. Smith sent a man to ascertain if horses could go to the Creek. He soon returned with the discouraging news that there were so many gullies washed out, that travelling on horseback would be impossible. So thanking Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith for all they had done, and all they had tried to do for us we set out on our pilgrimage of two and a half miles to the Creek. We were accompanied by a colored man and woman and a boy and girl some twelve or thirteen years of age. They carried our hand baggage, and assisted us in any necessary way. I suppose these helpers were sent with us by the Smiths, but do not now remember whether that was the case, or whether we had engaged the man, and the others had volunteered their assistance. Any way we could hardly have got along without them We did not make any special effort to follow the road, which gave us no better travelling than the fields. We were liable to get our feet entangled in the telegraph wires (the poles having been thrown down by the flood) as well as other obstacles, so we chose the easiest walking, whether highway or field. My chief anxiety was on account of poor Mrs. Lewis, who would frequently drop down and declare her inability to proceed. At such times, while Mrs. Livermore sat by her to encourage and comfort her, I would hasten on a little way and then return, to assure them that the path before us was much better than what we had already travelled, and so encouraged and a little rested she would face the inevitable and press on once more. We would frequently come to ditches or gullies five or six feet wide, and as many in depth. In such emergencies, the man who accompanied us would bring a rail from a nearby fence to form a slender bridge which we would cross by clasping hands — the man at the head of the chain, and sidle across. I do not remember how many such bridges we traversed. Sometimes we would have to climb a steep bank — pulling ourselves up by the vines and bushes growing there. At one place I found I had assisted myself by clinging to the vine of the poison oak as it is called in Virginia — better known here as ivy, but luckily I experienced no ill effects from it. We were thankful enough when we came in sight of Moores Creek — the last obstacle between us and Charlottesville — and a mud be-spattered, dilapidated looking crowd we were. They had constructed a ferry across the Creek, so we crossed easily to the Charlottesville side. A man was waiting there with a rough wagon, who wanted to take us into town, and my companions were in favor of employing him, but I said most emphatically "No! We have had a hard journey so far, and will finish it in comfort." and seeing a colored boy who belonged to our schools loitering about there I sent him to town for a carriage "the best one in town" was the order. I then took my tired friends to the house of a colored woman I knew to await its arrival. She made Mrs. Lewis lie down, while she prepared tea for us, and did all she could for our comfort. By the time the carriage arrived, all were much refreshed, and in a better condition to finish our journey. As we rode through the principal street of the town we passed two of the gentlemen who had lodged in the house with us at Shadwell. They recognized us and raised their hats and Mrs. Lewis expressed her gratitude that I did not consent to taking the shabby vehicle we saw at the Creek. She had not supposed that Charlottesville was so large and important a place. When we reached my Virginia home, I had Miss Gardners bed chamber put in order for Mrs. Lewis and her little boy, as Miss G. had not arrived and I knew she could not reach the place until the roads were passable. A bed was made each night on the couch in my sitting room for Mrs. Livermore. They remained my guests for a week, when learning that a freight train was about to try to pass down their line, they decided to get passage on it if possible. Chairs were carried out to the junction of the two roads near the school house, and there they sat with their few belongings about them for hours, not daring to leave for fear the train would come along, and knowing it would only wait to change the switch. It finally came, and they were helped into a car and rode on as we afterwards learned, into greater hardships and more difficulties than they had experienced before. Sometimes they rode on hand cars, and sometimes they had to walk for miles between conveyences. The money I loaned them purchased food and paid for lodgings here and there. People were kind to them seeing their pitiful condition, and after several days of this uncomfortable pilgrimage, they they reached Mrs. Lewis home in Tennessee. I heard from them as soon as they could possibly write me, and they returned the ten dollars promptly. Miss Gardner arrived the day they left. One of my trunks reached me in about a week, and the other some days later. I considered myself fortunate to get them at all. This storm was always spoken of afterwards by the colored people as the time of the "great fresh," meaning freshet.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Chapter Thirteenth Incidents about Home I have related in a previous chapter that our first home was in a large brick building called indifferently "The Mudwall" or "The Delavan." This building had been used by the Confederates for a hospital, and so came under the jurisdiction of the U. S. government at the close of the war. Sometime in '67 or '68 the property was ceded back to the original owners, and we had living rooms fitted up for us in the building used for our schools. A colored family named Poindexter had lo occupied some of the lower rooms in Mudwall, having acted as servants in Maj. Heads family while the military were there. This family hastened to secure a home elsewhere as quickly as possible, but it was necessary for Miss Gardner and myself to remain until our rooms in the school building were ready for us to occupy. Miss Gardner felt that it wasn't quite safe for us to be entirely alone in this big building at night, so a young man who attended my evening school, volunteered to sleep in one of the lower rooms to act as a guard, or be called upon in any emergency. He was a tall strong fellow quite black, and had been a soldier in some one of the colored regiments. He was very anxious to learn, and used to spend his evenings while guarding our portals in studying his "Second Reader" I do not now recall his name. One evening there was to be some kind of a political meeting among the colored people, so he asked us if we would mind if he did not come in until about 10 o-clock as he wished to attend the meeting. We assured him that it would be all right, and we would sit up until he came and let him in, so we barred the doors securely and went to our separate rooms to read or write. Sometime between 9 and 10 Miss Gardner came to my room in a state of great trepidation declaring that she had heard some one walking about in the rooms down stairs. I felt sure that it was her imagination, but said I would go down and see, so I took my lamp and went down, she remaining lamp in hand at the head of the stairs as a sort of rear guard. I searched three of the rooms on the left of the hall without success, and then as I started for the large room at the right, I heard a slight sound and felt sure the intruder was in there. It seemed anything but a pleasant duty to go in, but I thought if danger was there it was best to put on a bold front and meet it half way rather than to wait for it to creep upon us, so I went in — a little shaky, I must confess, but determined to ferret out the cause of the sounds we had heard. I looked all about the room, behind the big pillars, and in the dark corners. There was nothing there to produce any kind of a sound. There was still one more room at the immediate left of the front door, and as I came back into the hall, I heard a slight noise in that direction. I started to go in when a hearty laugh at the front door stopped me, and I saw our guard looking in through the side light you can imagine that it was with a sense of relief that I unbarred the door and admitted, him. It happened that the meeting closed some -what earlier than he expected it would, and it was his step upon the piazza, and knock at the door that Miss Gardner had mistaken for noises in the rooms below. He saw me come down the stairs, as he supposed to let him in, and could not, at first, understand why I went hurrying from room to room instead of opening the door. But when I came out of the large room, and started for the one near the door, the truth dawned upon him, and the comical features of the situation struck him so forcibly that he laughed aloud — the best thing he could have done, as nothing else could have swept away the creepiness of the situation so promptly as did that merry, hearty laugh. I have mentioned in a previous chapter some of the annoyances we suffered from the students breaking our windows etc. and I will here relate another of their escapades as it seems to fit into this chapter. The incident occurred several months previous to the one just related while the Poindexters still occupied their rooms on the lower floor. The front door opening on the piazza usually stood open until quite late, and one evening some students passing up the railroad track, bravely "bearded the lion in his den," by rushing into the hall stamping and swearing like demons. Evidently their purpose was simply to frighten us, but knowing the reputation many of them bore, we could not be sure that no harm was intended. Miss Gardner hastened to my room and begged me to lock the door, which I did at first, but as the noise and racket continued I could not endure to remain inside, so I went out telling her to lock herself in if she chose, but I preferred the freedom of the large halls and many rooms to dodge about in if there were any real danger, and I wanted to see just what they were doing: so I placed myself at the head of the stairs, where I was in the dark, and could see them jumping and kicking about in the hall below, the open door giving light enough for that purpose. "Come on up stairs! Come on! Lets go up stairs!" I could hear one of them say but no move was made to do so Had they started to come up, it was my intention to speak, and, if possible halt them at once. Some of the colored people had told them to be very careful how they disturbed us, as we each had two revolvers and knew how to use them. This was a fairy tale, but it might have had its weight, for of course, had it been true, we should have had a decided advantage, standing at the head of the stairs in the dark, while they were exposed from the light through the open door. However they made no move to come up, and much to my relief, they soon went away. I saw as they passed through the door that there were four of them. I remained at er the number buried there but it must have been many hundred for the cemetary was a large one. The graves were arranged in regular rows each with its white head board, lettered in black and very many of the graves bore only this inscription "Unknown Union Soldier" with Co. and Regt. This brought home to me in all its force the fact that there were many families mourning the loss of dear ones, whose fate was all unknown to them, and of whose last resting place they had no knowledge. Of course we made a good many trips to Monticello (which place I have described in a previous chapter) this being the most interesting spot in the vicinity to our occasional visitors, but what I have related covers about all that we made any attempt to see outside Charlottesville in the nine and a half years I was there</field>
