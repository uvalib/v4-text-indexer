      <field name="fulltext">Note In my report for 1904 I gave the reasons in favor of the printing by the Library of this and of similar unpublished manuscript records in its possession. It would save excessive wear and tear upon the originals; it would enable the texts to be studied by investigators who can not come to Washington; and it would encourage that thorough, detailed, and continuing study of them which their value and interest and a proper understanding of American history require. These reasons apply with peculiar force to the Records of the Virginia Company, unique in themselves and unique of their kind, and an additional one, in their case influential; that publication would make them available to persons who would not master the difficult chirography of the original. Their history is fully told in the Introduction by Miss Kingsbury, and their importance as a document emphasized in the Preface by Professor Osgood. Previous efforts to secure their publication in extenso had not been successful. The present one originated in a proposal by Professor Osgood in behalf of the Public Archives Commission of the American Historical Association to edit them as a contribution to one of the Annual Reports of the Association; and although the work as issued is an independent publication of the Library, it has had the benefit of his expert counsel. It was at his instance also that Miss Kingsbury, then a graduate student in his department at Columbia, began the undertaking which she has so well accomplished, and which has consisted (1) in a complete transcript of the text itself; (2) in a close study not merely of this but of the numerous collateral and subsidiary documents both here and abroad; (3) in the preparation of the Introduction, Notes, Bibliography, and Index; and (4) in aid upon the proof. The proof has also, however, been read word for word with the original text, and revised by the Chief of the Division of Manuscripts, with the excellent assistance of Miss Minnie V. Stinson of that Division. Herbert Putnam Librarian of Congress Worthington Chauncey Ford Chief, Division of Manuscripts</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Preface The records, and especially the Court Book, of the Virginia Company of London have long been regarded as among the most precious manuscript treasures which have found a lodgment within the United States. Not only is their inherent value as an historical source very great, as has been explained by the editor in her introduction, but a sentimental value also attaches to them. This has a twofold origin. It arises, in the first place, from the fact that they belong at once to the romantic period of our own beginnings and to the heroic period of England's great struggle against absolutism. The men who figure in the pages of this record were at the same time playing their parts, on the one side or the other, in the controversies which were then beginning with James I, and which were to broaden and deepen under his son till England was plunged into the agonies of the great civil war. They were contemporaries, and in not a few cases associates, of Coke and Eliot and Hampden, of Bacon and Wentworth and Buckingham. The names of Sandys and the Ferrars stand high on the roll of patriots by which the first generation of the Stuart period is distinguished. These same men also, together with a long list of the merchants and nobles of the time, were deeply interested in discovery and colonization. As successors of Gilbert and Raleigh they were planting a new England beyond the Atlantic. About this enterprise still clung some of the spirit and memories of the Elizabethan seamen and their early struggles with Spain. In the days when Smythe and Sandys were active the prosaic age of English colonization had not yet begun. The glamour of romance, of the heroic, attaches to the founding of Virginia and Plymouth, and makes them fit subjects for the poet. By the time when the other colonies were founded the glow and inspiration had grown faint or wholly disappeared. In the Records of the Virginia Company some reflection may be seen of this early zeal, of the plans and ideals to which it gave rise. Even their pages, cast in a style which is quite unusual in records of this nature, make one realize that he is in the company of noble and earnest spirits, men who were conscious that they were engaged in a great enterprise. The Court Book itself, now that it is printed in full, will be found to be a worthy monument of English speech, as it was used at the close of the Elizabethan epoch and by contemporaries of Shakespeare and Bacon. The fate which probably befell the original of this record, and the unusual steps which it became necessary to take in order to secure and preserve a copy, were nat- ural consequences of the struggles of the time, and add still further to the interest of the text as we now possess it. Miss Kingsbury, by her use of the Ferrar papers, has been able to establish by the clearest proof the connection of Nicholas Ferrar with the transcription, and in many other ways she has added definiteness to the accounts usually given of the origin and preservation of the record as we now possess it. The transfer of the copy of the Court Book to Virginia and its transmission from hand to hand till, through the medium of Thomas Jefferson's library, it finally passed into the possession of Congress fittingly concludes the remarkable history of the preservation of this manuscript. The high estimate which has been placed on its value is evidenced not only by the use that has been made of it by historians, but by the long-continued efforts which have been made to secure its publication. In 1858 Mr. J. Wingate Thornton, in an article in the "Historical Magazine," explained the nature of the Court Book, told how it had been preserved, and insisted upon the importance of its being published. "As these volumes are of national rather than of local interest," said he, "reaching back to the very foundation of the English companies for colonizing America; as they have escaped the chances and mishaps of two centuries, on either side of the Atlantic, ... and as Providence has now placed them in the keeping of our National Congress, is it not our national duty to have them appropriately edited and published?" The following year Mr. Thornton published a pamphlet in Boston, in which he outlined the history of the manuscript and again raised the question of its publication. But soon the Civil War came on, and plans of that kind, especially so far as they related to southern history, had to be postponed. But in 1868, three years after the close of the war, Mr. Edward D. Neill pre- sented a memorial to Congress, in which he dwelt on the neglect by historians of these most valuable manuscripts. He stated that, while preparing his book entitled "Terra Mariae," he had familiarized himself with the chirography of the records. He now offered to undertake their editing without compensation, if he might be fur- nished with two copyists for a limited time and be allowed a small sum for stationery and contingent expenses. But this offer met with no response, and Mr. Neill was forced to content himself with the publication of extracts from the manuscript in his "History of the Virginia Company of London" (Albany, 1869). In March, 1877, Mr. Robert A. Brock, of the Virginia Historical Society, pub- lished in the "Richmond Daily Dispatch" a "Plea for the Publication of the Records of the Virginia Company." In 1881 Senator John W. Johnston, of Virginia, intro- duced into Congress a bill which was intended to provide for the publication of the records. This passed the Senate, but failed in the House. During three successive sessions between the years 1885 and 1888 Dr. J. Franklin Jameson applied to the Library Committee of Congress for permission to edit and publish the records without expense to the Government. His plan was to obtain a sufficient number of subscribers to justify the issue of the volumes by a private firm and to meet the cost of the sale. Another suggestion which he also made was the appointment of a commission which should concern itself with the publishing of historical material in the possession of Congress. While occupied with this matter Dr. Jameson explained the history and value of the records to the Rhode Island Historical Society, and his address was reviewed in the "Magazine of American History" (vol. 21, January–June, 1889, p. 82). But meantime some progress had been made with the actual printing of the Court Book. Mr. Conway Robinson had made copious extracts from it, especially of the documentary material which is contained in the second volume. His extracts the Virginia Historical Society published in 1889, under the editorship of Mr. R. A. Brock. Until the present time this edition, in two volumes, has served the purpose of most students. But the requirements of historical study in this country have now reached a point where more complete and critical editions of the sources are needed than have been common in the past. If this need was to be met, it became at once apparent that no body of records was better adapted for a beginning than those which related to the Virginia Company of London. In date and subject matter they stand at the very threshold of American history. In character they form a distinct and unique group of material. By the issue of a definitive edition of these records the demand which scholars have so long made for their publication would be met and satisfied. It was under the influence of considerations like these that the present work was undertaken. In the preparation of this body of records for the press critical accuracy and helpfulness have been sought in all possible ways. The spelling of the original has been carefully preserved throughout, for in editing a source of this character and importance any attempt to modernize the text would be properly regarded as unjusti- fiable. Not only has the spelling been preserved, but also the signs and abbrevia- tions which abound, the use of which the men of the period had inherited from still earlier times. So far as such a thing is possible in print, the text is exactly repro- duced in these volumes, while an added element of reality is supplied by the photo- graphs of specimen pages of the original manuscript. Brief notes have been added where it was necessary to explain or call attention to obscurities, omissions, or other irregularities in the text, the purpose being to enable the reader to gain information of this kind from the printed page with the same certainty as if he were using the manuscript. In the notes, cross references have also been given to the documents of the company and to its publications, when they have been found to reproduce, or to illustrate and make more definite, the state- ments which are contained in the Court Book. In citations of this kind the number of each document is given as it appears in the List of Records in the Introduction. In this way the unity of the records of the company as a whole receives illustration, and the investigator will be aided in any effort which he may make to learn all which they have to reveal in reference to any subject. Finally, the index completes the invaluable service which Miss Kingsbury has rendered in the editorship of the work. Herbert L. Osgood Columbia University</field>

      <field name="fulltext">1. The Character of the Company The individual effort which had revealed itself at the close of the medieval period in other phases of the economic development and in the military history of the past quarter century was especially prominent in the movement in 1606 for a society of adventurers to trade in Virginia. The commercial advance had been due chiefly to private enterprise, and the naval expeditions into the West Indies against the Spanish had been fitted out and prosecuted by such adventurous spirits as Sir Francis Drake, while the zeal for exploration and for gold, which inspired John and Sebastian Cabot to search for a passage to Cathay and the East Indies in 1497, led Sir Humphrey Gilbert and Sir Walter Raleigh a century later to seek out the resources of the lands from Florida to Newfoundland. It is the same spirit of adventure which inspired the narratives of John Smith and Henry Spelman as they told of their relations with the Indians of America. But it is in the progress of both the commercial and the political life of England that the Virginia Company is important. For the plantation founded and nourished by a private concern as an enterprise purely for gain was the social cause from which developed the colony as a form of government. Its political organization is seen in its relations to the Crown, of which there were two distinct phases. During the first three years it was distinctly a creature of the King, the affairs of which were conducted by the King through a council created by himself and responsible to himself, while to the investors were left the privileges of raising the funds, furnishing the supplies, and sending out the expeditions. It was a modification of this form of management to which the government reverted after the dissolution of the Company in 1624, and again at the end of the century when royal colonies were substituted for proprietary and corporate forms throughout America. In the second phase the undertakers became distinctly proprietary, retaining the commercial responsibilities, but assum- ing governmental functions in place of the King. A comparison between the royal grants for discovery in the sixteenth century and those of the Virginia Company shows that there was an increase in the direct territorial relations between King and subject, a limitation upon monopoly of trade, and a tendency on the part of the Crown to retain directly or indirectly the powers of government. Thus, in the letters patent to Richard Warde, Thomas Ashehurst, and associates in 1501,a a Biddle, Cabot, Appendix, pp. 312, 314, for this charter. to Sir Humphrey Gilbert in 1578, and to Sir Walter Raleigh in 1584,b b Hakluyt, Principal Navigations, VIII, 17–23, 289–296. the Crown conferred proprietorship of land with the right to grant it out in fee simple at will. But in 1606 the land was held by the undertakers, and again in 1609 by the adventurers and planters in free and common socage, as of the manor of Greenwich of the county of Kent. Under the first Vir- ginia charter it was granted by the King to those approved by the council; under the second, by the members of the company to anyone who should have adventured a certain sum of money or his person. The fief, distinctly so called in the early charters, for which homage was to be rendered, with no service, however, save that of one-fifth of the gold and silver gained, had disappeared; and the only direct feudal relation with the King which remained arose from the requirement of a per cent of the precious metals. The monopoly of trade by which Warde, Gilbert, and Raleigh were allowed to seize and detain any one who trafficked within two hundred leagues of a set- tlement was altered in 1606 so that the planters had only the right of collecting a tax from such interlopers. The rights of government which had been surrendered absolutely to the grantees in the sixteenth century charters were reserved to the King by the letters patent of 1606 to be exercised through the council. In 1609 these powers were conferred on the company as an open body, it must be remem- bered, and thus differed from the earlier grants and from the later proprietary grants to Lord Baltimore or to William Penn. Although the charter emphasizes the government of the plantation, the Virginia Company was purely a commercial enterprise conducted by a private concern, even before the charter of 1609, as is shown by the history of its early years. It was backed by the patronage of the King, but only for the purpose of advancing the trade of the Kingdom in foreign parts and saving the Crown from expense and responsi- bility, as had been the policy in regard to the other trading companies. Nevertheless, it was a step toward colonial expansion, for, as has well been said, "the explorer is potentially a colonizer," and the army of laborers on the plantation became in time an army of free tenants in a colony.c c Osgood, H. L., The American Colonies in the 17th Century, I, 83. While in the spirit of its commercial life the company was closely allied to the efforts for exploration and search for gold, morally supported by Elizabeth in her feudal grants, in its organization, as well as in its pur- pose, it resembled the private companies for trade based on ancient charters, and in its development is to be understood only through a knowledge of both of these earlier movements. Thus in order to protect trade, but not for exploration and settlement, the ancient charters granted to the Merchant Adventurers in 1407 and 1462, and particularly the one of 1564, incorporated that company into a "Body Politick." The words of the grant declared its purpose to be "for the good Government, Rule and Order of the * * * Fellowship of Merchants Adventurers * * *. As also of all and every other of the subject of our heirs * * * using the seate of Trade of the said Merchants Adventurers * * *."a a Lingelbach, The Merchant Adventurers of England, 218–236 for extracts from the charters. The first two are published in Rymer, Foedera, and Hakluyt. This was also the object expressed in the charter to the East India Company,b b East India Company, Charters. although it contained an additional provi- sion for the acquisition of lands by purchase. Monopoly of trade and powers of government over factors, masters, or others in the employ of the company were conferred, but the exemption from customs was to continue for only four years, and the only settlements provided for were to have the form of factories. It had been established as a regulated company, that is, one in which each individual invested his own capital subject to the rules of the company; but in 1612 by increasing the importance of the directors and investing sums for a limited period it became a joint stock company.c c Cunningham, W., the Growth of English Industry and Commerce in Modern Times (edition of 1903), Part I, ch. VI, sec. VII. As a prototype of the companies later incorporated both for discovery and trade, such as the Virginia Company, the Muscovy or Russian Company, known as the "Merchant Adventurers of England for the discoveries of lands and territories unknown," was established in 1555 with a joint stock of £6,000. Sebastian Cabot was appointed governor for life and with him was associated a board of directors of 4 consuls and 24 assistants. However, this company had also the rights of the compa- nies for exploration—that is, those of conquest, of acquiring lands, and of seizing the ships of any who should infringe on their monopoly of trade.d d See the patent in Hakluyt, II, 304–316. For full citation of the titles of printed works referred to in the notes, see the Bibliography, p. 212, post. In 1583 a committee from the Muscovy merchants drew up a set of resolutions concerning a conference with M. Carlile upon his "intended discoverie and attempt into the hithermost parts of America,"e e See "Articles set down by the Committees appointed in behalfe of the Company of muscovian Marchants to conferre with M. Carlile, upon his intended discoverie and attempt into the hither most parts of America," printed in Hakluyt, VIII, 147–150. which was not dissimilar to the plan of Sir Walter Raleigh, and hence foreshadowed companies of the seventeenth century. It proposed to send forth 100 men for one year, providing £4,000 for the adventure, in order to gain a "knowledge of the particular estate of the country and gather what commodity may hereafter be looked for." Also, like the Virginia Company, it provided for a joint stock consisting of two groups, one of "adventurers" and one of "enterprisers," each to have one-half of the lands which should be divided among the members by the generality, but all trade was to belong to the adventurers and the corporation was to be closed after the first adventure. The scheme differed from the sixteenth century enterprises, which were especially intended for exploration, in that no question of government was considered, but it conformed to the ideas of Gilbert and Raleigh and of the trading companies, in that its rights over trade were to be purely monopolistic. Apparently this plan of the Muscovy Company stands as a connecting link between the ideas of the explorer and those of the trader and the planter, a plan which may be said to have been carried out by the Virginia Company. It is significant that many of the members of the Virginia Company were men who had taken part in the expeditions of the late sixteenth century and had been interested in certain private voyages of exploration carried on during the five years preceding the receipt of its first charter, while most of the leaders of this company were at the same time stock- holders and even officers in the Muscovy Company, the Company of Merchant Adventurers, the East India Company, and later of the Turkey, the Guinea, and the African companies. It is unnecessary to cite the charters of other companies or to search the history of the trading corporations of the sixteenth century in order to show that the Virginia Company was similar in character. But, like the Muscovy Company and the East India Company, it was established to carry on trade in new and uninhabited lands, and hence had the additional features of a company whose purpose was exploration and plantation. The latter characteristic appears more especially in the charter, the former in the instructions and correspondence of the entire period of its life. The object of its first undertakers was doubtless to search for minerals and for a route to the southwest, and to secure for trade the materials which were native and peculiar to those regions. The plantation was a necessity for this purpose, and incidentally, because of the character of the country, it was forced to become a colony. To estab- lish a settlement which should become a market for English goods, to advance the shipping, to spread the religion of the Kingdom were doubtless motives which aroused sympathy for the undertaking; but the arguments which brought investment were the opportunities for gain. The position of the Virginia Company in the development of English exploration and trade was therefore important, and the study of its history is of value not only for the light which it throws on Virginia itself but for an understanding of the economic condition of England as well. Nor is this all. The few private records which remain of the Merchant Adventurers Company and those of the East India Company correspond so closely in form and in subject-matter to the court book of the Virginia Company that the similarity in form of organization and methods of conducting business is established. The fact that the private records, the books from which the knowledge of the actual financial transactions could be obtained, are missing in most cases, may prove that their loss in the case of the early Virginia Company is not due to intentional destruction, but to the general opinion of the period that such material was valueless. The only other enterprise of which there is sufficient material for anything like an exhaustive study is the East India Company, and hence its records combine with those of the Virginia Company to supply a source of information concerning all of these companies. The conclusion seems valid, therefore, that the great mass of min- utes, orders, instructions, letters, and memoranda of the company for Virginia will aid in the interpretation of the comparatively few records of the earlier associations. The records of this company are necessary to enable one to comprehend the life of the other companies, as is its history to the understanding of their development. It was during the life of the company that the plantation gradually assumed the aspects of a colony, that the settlement which was originally planned for exploration and the discovery of gold became a center for the development of the natural and agricultural resources of the surrounding country. The origin within the colony of the assembly, of local government, of private ownership of land, and of freedom of trade is to be found before the dissolution of the company by the Crown. There- fore the records of the company, as well as those of the colony, form the material through which the history of the beginnings of English colonies, viewed from the standpoint of the colonist, is to be gained. Their value for the comprehension of the development of political institutions in England is not so patent. The growing correspondence between the Crown and the company and the interference in the acts of the company stand as evidence of the gradual increase of the interest of the Crown or its council in the undertaking. This interest was most apparent when the tobacco trade promised a revenue to the Crown, but the encouragement of the growth of other staple products, the spasmodic revival of acts touching English shipping and the balance of trade, and the main- tenance of staple ports in England are all new activities appearing in the records of the company. Throughout, also, is apparent the readiness to allow the already uncertain economic policy to be altered or nullified by the political relations with Spain, or because of moral or whimsical views. The gradual definition of policy on the part of the Stuarts, perhaps first apparent under Charles I, is closely connected with the leaders of the Virginia Company. The opinions expressed in the courts of the company by the adherents both of the Puritan party and of the party of the Crown, the correspondence between the Privy Council and the company, the letters and memoranda concerning the company and its policy, and the story of the formation of the Sandys and the Warwick factions, resulting in the dissolution of the company, furnish evidence of the gradual development of the despotic attitude of the Stuarts, especially in their reach for revenue and in their repression of the principles of freedom. The appointment of the commissions to investigate the affairs of the company and the condition of the colony, the creation of a commission for the control of the colony after the overthrow of the charter, the later appointment of a committee of the Privy Council for the same purpose are all steps in the growth of a colonial system and of a colonial policy. Although the maturity of this system and policy is not reached until after the Commonwealth, the influence of the associates of James I and of Charles I is apparent. Every phase of colonial development, from the mixed system which existed under the patent of 1606 to the chartered proprietary company after 1609 and the royal province after 1624, is here illustrated. The transition from the chartered to the Royal Government in 1624, the prelude to "the most important transition in American history previous to the colonial revolt," is only to be understood from these records, since the tendency to self-government in the colony is one of the pretended reasons for the overthrow of the company. All the steps of the change are to be traced in the royal correspondence, in the memoranda of the royal party, and in the record of the suit under the writ of quo warranto. The significance of such material is best understood from the fact that "the constitutional law and practice of the old colonial system has not yet been attempted to be known," and as yet no book has been written concerning the forms or functions of the British Government as employed in colonial administration. 2. The Records of the Company under Sir Thomas Smythe The Organization of the Company as in 1606 In the year preceding the grant of a charter to the Virginia Company there had been movements along two lines for establishing plantations in Virginia, one by private investment and the other by royal patronage. Examples of the private interests are the enterprise of the Earl of Southampton in 1605 and that of Lord Zouch as set forth in his contracta a Printed in full in Brown, Genesis of the United States, I, 33–35. with Captain George Waymouth of October 30, 1605. In this Lord Zouch agreed to secure and provide two ships and 200 men of "arts suitable for a colony," and to pay £100 to Captain Waymouth for the trans- portation of the same. The interesting feature is the agreement, suggestive of feudal relations, that Lord Zouch should be the first officer and have the first choice of land, while Captain Waymouth as second officer should have second choice of land, which he was to hold from the former as lord paramount for himself, his heirs and assigns. At the same time Sir John Popham was busily engaged in the attempt to form royal colonies by obtaining charters from the Crown, whereby the territory from 34° to 45° north latitude should be taken under the protection of the King, and private settlements should thus be excluded. The plan which obtained followed neither course, though it was bound to result in a modification of Popham's scheme. The motives of the grantees and the arguments which induced the King in 1606 to abandon the policy of Elizabeth and to give royal patronage to the undertaking, and even to assume royal control, are set forth in a petition presented to Parliament in 1606, entitled "Reasons for raising a publique stocke to be imploied in the discovering of such countries as may be found most convenient * * * ."b b Printed in full, Brown, Genesis, I, 36–42. It is evident, however, that the unknown plan of investment in the adventure of 1606 is not here suggested, since there was no intima- tion of financial support by the King. The stock was apparently to be raised by a tax "Upon the emoderate gaines of those that contrary to lawe abuse the poore." and was not in any way to be "raised upon the sweat of the poore or the industrie of the husbandmen, Artificer, or tradisman," but in such a way that nothing should "be demanded from anie man without presente assurance of gaine and hope of future profit * * * but in such sorte that the payer shall for every ijd paied gaine iiijd." To the Kingdom and to the Crown were to redound the greatest gain. Ten thousand pounds a year were to be added to His Majesty's receipts by an increase of many thousand pounds in the imposts and customs; and furthermore it "would savior too much of affectacon of a popular State to levie monies without imparting some convenient portion to his Majestie." But the value to shipping was emphasized perhaps more vigorously as developing a defence to the island, as furnishing a source for the necessities for ships—cordage, pitch, tar, and resin—and as protecting the shipping from decay. The desirability of a revival of the declining export trade, as well as that of establishing the importation of necessities from a part of the dominions, though distant, was urged, together with the importance of strengthening by settlement those countries already acquired by discovery. That such undertakings by private enterprise had been failures; that it was more honorable for the State to back an exploitation by public consent than by private monopoly; that public colonies were bound to be more obedient and industrious because of the greater confidence in the character of the control, were all reasons which had long before been set forth whereby to gain the support of the Crown. Charter of 1606. The royal aid as finally obtained for a colonial enterprise came in a somewhat different form. The letters patent to Sir Thomas Gates and others for plantations to be made in Virginiaa a For a reprint of the letters patent, see Brown, Genesis, I, 52–62, or Poore's Constitutions. show that the investment was made solely by individuals, and that the joint stock was not public, although in the regulation of affairs in the colony the body of undertakers was to have little influence, even as far as its commercial interests in the plantation were concerned. The business management was left to the joint stock companies, and the magazine was controlled by a treasurer or cape merchant and by two clerks elected by the President and Council in the Colony. In fact, the only activity of the adventurers, so far as it is revealed in the extant documents, consisted in the choice in London of one or more groups of agents, called "companies," to manage the goods sent out and received and to look after the profits.b b Articles, Instructions and Orders for the government of the Colonies, November 20, 1606. Reprinted in Brown, Genesis, I, 64–75, from a manuscript record book in the register's office of Virginia. There is a manuscript copy in the Library of Congress, in the Virginia Miscellaneous Records, 1606–1692, pp. 25–33. The undertakers were to have all lands with their resources which lay within 50 miles of the plantation in any direction, together with the islands within 100 miles of the coast, and were privileged to inhabit and fortify the same according as the council for Virginia should direct. The right freely to transport subjects was granted the investors, while they were permitted customs free for seven years to export armor, provisions, and all necessities of life for the colonists. They could impose upon any subjects of the Crown, who were not adventurers, trafficking in those regions, a tax of 2? per cent of the articles concerned, and upon foreigners twice that amount, and thus maintain a control of the trade for twenty-one years. But the government of the colonies and of the territory of Virginia was reserved to the Crown through the council of thirteen for Virginia, which was to be appointed by the King and to reside in England. Instructionsa a Printed in full, Brown, Genesis, I, 64–75. were issued and signed by the royal hand, which outlined the form of administering affairs in the settlement and created a council of thirteen in the colony. They conferred upon it the right to coin money and to pass ordinances which should be valid till altered by the Crown, provided that they should be consonant with the laws of England. This council in Virginia was to choose its own president for one year. It could remove him or any member for just cause and fill the vacancies. All civil causes and all lesser criminal cases were to be decided by the president and council, the former having two votes in case of a tie. Cases of manslaughter and the more heinous crimes were to be tried before a jury and were punishable with death. To the president and council was reserved the right of pardon. The council in England nominated to the Crown the persons to whom lands were to be granted by the King. It had, in fact, the supervision of affairs, appointed the first council in Virginia, issued orders for the conduct of the first expedition under Captain Newport,b b See Certain Orders and Directions, December 10, 1606.

Manuscript in the Library of Congress, Vir- ginia Miscellaneous Records, 1606–1692, pp. 14–17. Reprinted in Brown, Genesis, 1, 79–85. as to the establishment of a fort and of a town. It is in this latter document that the first indication of the real motive of the undertaking is found. The orders laid down were to "make choice" of the river "which bendeth most toward the North-West, for that way you shall soonest find the other sea," while the choice of a healthy location, wise inter- course with the natives, and the fortification and preparation of a single settle- ment were emphasized. The chief objects, however, were to plant in a place which should be fitted "to receive the trade of all the countries about," to dis- cover minerals, and to find the passage to the western sea. The loss of the records, both of the council and of the "companies" for trade, covering this period, leaves, as the only source of information, both for affairs in England and in Virginia, the narratives of the early settlers. Of these the most important are the reports of Captain Newport, and the relations of John Smith, of Edward Maria Wingfield, and of George Percy.a a See John Smith, A True Relation, 1608, reprinted in Arber, Works of John Smith, 1884; Discourse of Virginia, by Edward Maria Wingfield, printed in the Archaeologia Americana, IV, 77–103; Observa- tions gathered out of a Discourse of the Plantation * in Virginia * 1606, by George Percy, printed in Brown, Genesis, I, 152–168; and the following documents probably written by Captain Archer: A Relatyon of the Discovery of Our River, from James Forte into the maine: * * by Capt. Christopher Newport, 1607, printed in Archaeologia Americana, IV, 40–58; The Description of the now-discovered river and country of Virginia, printed in the Archaeologia Americana, IV, 59–62; A Brief Description of the People, printed in Archaeologia Americana, IV, 63–65. The council had dispatched three expeditions, all under Captain Newport; one in December, 1606, in three ships with 120 emigrants; another in October, 1607, with two vessels and about the same number of passengers; and a third in August of 1608 with about 70 emigrants. The reports of Newport, Percy, Wingfield, and Smith encouraged the managers of the enterprise to continue their efforts, but proved that a change in object as well as in policy would be necessary. From Newport came descriptions of the fruitful- ness of the soil, of the quantities of fish and of timber, and of clay for making brick, and enumerations of the possible exports, comprising sturgeon, clapboard, wainscot, saxafrage, tobacco, dyes, furs, pitch, resin, turpentine, oils, wines, wood and soap ashes, iron, copper, pearls; but the reports as to the mines were vague. He declared that the country was rich in gold and copper, and took home with him earth to be assayed, while Smith, in A True Relation, states that he had been left to dig a rock which Captain Newport thought was a mine, but no mention of results is made. The full description of the country by Newport and also by Captain John Smith gave the council a clear idea of its geography, as is indicated by the instructions to Sir Thomas Gates in 1609. But the expedition, which penetrated to a distance of 160 miles up the river, brought the explorers to hostile tribes and left the council still uncertain, though hopeful of the discovery of a passage to the south sea. Further- more, Captain Newport positively stated that there could be no commerce with the Indians, and all evidence shows that the natives were to be a resource for the neces- sities of life rather than for the exchange of lucrative objects of trade. Hence it is that the broadside which was issued by the company in 1609,b b Nova Britannia, printed February 18, 1609. This document is reprinted in Force's Tracts, I, No. 6. as an incident of its attempt to secure capital for the undertaking in its new form, emphasized the rich- ness of the soil and the resources of the country—which in later years would yield abundant return—the value of the settlement as a market for English cloths, and the advantage to shipping and shipbuilding which would come from colonization. But the effort to develop the resources of the country and to found a settlement for such purposes rather than for exploration required larger investments and more men. Then, too, the regulation of the affairs of the colony without any control from the council in England meant continued jealousies and quarrels among such a small number of colonists and under such unsettled conditions. According to Wingfield the provisions for defense seem to have been insufficient, the magazine was mismanaged, and the relations with the Indians were strained. To John Smith must be attributed the wisdom of foreseeing the necessity of strong support from England and of the establishment of permanent colonial settlements and the develop- ment of the country for self-support.a a For a history of the organization of the company and of the founding of the colony, see Osgood, I, Chs. i-iv. The Change in Character from 1606 to 1609 The fact that the source of authority before 1609 was in the Crown is nowhere so clearly evidenced as in the records themselves. The fundamental documents emanated from the King and his Council or from the council for Virginia representing the royal authority, all instructions to officers bore the sign manual and all letters and reports from Captain Newport, from Edward- Maria Wingfield, and from his associates were addressed to the council for Virginia. Furthermore, the president and council appeared in the name of the Crown as the plaintiffs in a suit by which an attempt was made to enforce the contract with the master of the "Guift of God" for supplying provisions to the passengers in a voyage to North Virginia.b b Bibliographical List of the Records of the Virginia Company, post, p. 121, No. 7. The direct relations of the planters to the Crown are similarly emphasized by two heretofore unpublished documents, which are in the Library of Congress, consisting of the oaths administered to the colonists and to the secretary of the colony.c c List of Records, p. 121, Nos. 5, 6. The commercial status of the undertaking is more difficult to determine than the political. That the company was organized for the purpose of exploration and trade has been proved, but whether the control of trade was vested in the council or in companies or groups of undertakers is uncertain. The exact relation of the council to the plantation and of the Crown to the enterprise must have been stated in the court book, in which were kept the records of the acts of the council and perhaps of the companies for the administration of trade. This book, covering the period from the 28th of January, 1606, to the 14th of February, 1615, was in the possession of the company as late as 1623, but unfortunately no trace of the book has yet been discovered and even its existence has heretofore been unknown.a a When the Privy Council demanded the records of the company, a receipt bearing the date April 21, 1623, was given to the secretary of the company for the "several court books." This document was discovered by the Editor among the Ferrar papers, Magdalene College, Cambridge, in December 1903. See List of Records, p. 171, No. 470. Whatever may have been the source of control, the narrations of Captain Percy, Edward-Maria Wingfield, and Captain Newport indicate that the business of the company consisted chiefly in raising funds and equipping expeditions to be sent to Virginia under Captain Newport. This failure of the investment to bring in returns of gold and silver and of articles for trade, or to accomplish anything in the way of discovery of trade routes to the East Indies during the first three years, served to convince both King and undertakers that a change in method of control was essential. The document known as "Reasons against publishing the Kings title to Virginia. A justification for planting Virginia"b b This document was recently found by the Editor in the Bodleian Library. Ibid., p. 121, No. 1. seems to show an agitation among the investors arising from fear lest the desire to placate Spain, or religious considerations, might lead the Crown to abandon the scheme. The arguments there adduced may well explain the readiness of the King to surrender not only the com- mercial and territorial control but also full rights of government to the corporate body of the Virginia company, and thus to avoid any rupture with Spain. Certain it is that the desire for more direct authority and for securing larger investments were the motives of the petitioners in asking for a new charter. As a result of this movement the letters patent of 1609 were issued, transform- ing the undertakers into a body politic. In this case also the documents are especially characteristic of the organization. Whereas the Crown was formerly the source of all power, beginning with 1609 the council of the company, acting as a standing committee for the adventurers rather than in the name of the King, exercised the controlling authority. After the charter of 1612 had provided for more frequent meetings of the generality, the council was gradually superseded by special committees and the tendency arose to decide all matters of importance in the general quarter courts and to insist upon all communications being addressed to the company rather than to the council. The act of incorporation erected a commercial company and made it the overlord of a proprietary province. It at once strengthened its plantation as a center for traffic and established a system for joint management of land and trade to extend over a period of seven years, prom- ising dividends to the adventurer and support to the planter. The records of the corporation reveal as clearly as do its broadsides and pamphlets that it was a business venture. These records may be grouped into seven classes.a a For the documents in these various classes, see the classifications by Roman numerals at the left of each entry under the "List of Records," post, pp. 121–205. The Classes of Records I.The fundamental documents of the company were those by virtue of which it had its legal formation, and consisted of the letters patent, charters, and orders in council issued by the King and Privy Council. II.The activity of the adventurers was recorded in the court books, which com- prised the minutes of the transactions of the company. In those books were kept the discussions and decisions with regard to the plantation, the granting of land, and all financial policies and plans for developing the enterprise and increasing the income. III.In carrying on its business the company gave commissions to the governors of the colony, issued regulations for the settlers, and, from time to time, sent instructions to the governor and council of the colony. It also granted lands and patents, entered into contracts, issued receipts, made pleas in court, and kept statements of accounts. IV.From the colony itself came reports, declarations, letters, and complaints. They were an essential part of the records of the company and often determined its course of action. V.To the public, for the purpose of inspiring confidence, securing adventurers, and maintaining the interest and support of its members, as well as of defending itself against the accusations of its enemies, the company issued advertisements, broadsides of its shipping investments, declarations, pamphlets, and sermons. VI.A large part of the information which came to the company was derived from private correspondence between members of the company and individual plant- ers. Furthermore, there was a gradual tendency to permit individuals or groups of individuals of the company to form stock companies for trade or plantation, and records of these transactions formed a valuable supplement to those of the company itself. VII.To the student of history another group of supplementary material is of great value. It comes from the records of contemporary companies, corporations, and towns, as well as from the correspondence of officers of state or of other persons who were not directly concerned in the transactions of the Virginia Company. All of these records of the company for the period previous to 1616, so far as they were known to him, were collected and reprinted in full or cited, if already available in America, by Alexander Brown, in the year 1890.a a For the documents of the period from 1606–1609 not mentioned by Mr. Brown in his Genesis of the United States, most of which have recently been discovered, see List of the Records of the Virginia Company, post, pp. 121–125, Nos. 1–38. I.—FUNDAMENTAL DOCUMENTS As far as appears from the evidence of the extant documents, when by the charters of 1609 and 1612, James I surrendered to the company full rights of trade, as well as territorial and governmental rights in Virginia he apparently lost all interest and part in the undertaking, and it was only when the plantation had developed into the colony, and when at the expiration of the privileges of free importation in 1619, the business of the corporation had become so good as to offer a prospect of revenue that the King in his council began to interfere in the affairs of the company.b b In March, 1619, Abraham and John Jacobs received a grant for the collection of customs or imports on tobacco. This became an important feature of the business of the company in its later procedure. See List of Records, pp. 127, 129, Nos. 53, 73. In 1613, under the administration of Sir Thomas Smythe, the adventurers were com- pelled to appeal to the Crown because of the complications with France which arose from the expedition of Sir Samuel Argall along the northern coasts of America,c c Brown, Genesis, II, 640–644. while a similar relation was brought about by the controversy with Spain with regard to the attack on Spanish vessels by the ship Treasurer in 1619.d d List of Records, p. 132, No. 102. In both instances the protection desired was granted. When the financial stringency forced the adven- turers to great efforts in 1614, and they appealed unsuccessfully to Parliament for aid, the Privy Council attempted to arouse confidence in the undertaking throughout the country. It passed orders urging the city companies of London to invest sums in the Virginia lottery, and in the following year it addressed similar orders to the "Several Cityes and Townes of the Kingdome,"e e Brown, Genesis, II, 676, 679, 685, 733, 760. with special letters to the lieu- tenants of County Surrey.f f List of Records, p. 126, No. 49. But the aid thus secured was not such as to draw upon the resources of the Crown, and the attempt of members of the company to gain a monopoly of the tobacco trade in 1616 met with the same opposition as had similar efforts on the part of the merchant adventurers in previous years. On the other hand the company was com- pelled against its will to submit to the treatment of its plantation as a penal colony by James I in his spasmodic efforts to develop a policy which should save England from an overpopulation of vagabonds.a a There is a series of 14 orders of the Privy Council for the transportation of prisoners to Virginia in the years 1617 and 1618 not hitherto noted. List of Records, pp. 121–131, Nos. 4, 41, 65, 90. The transportation thus effected is mentioned by Miss E. M. Leonard, The Early History of the English Poor Relief, pp. 229–230, n. With the exception of these unimportant relations with the Crown, the company seems to have conducted its business independently of royal aid or interference dur- ing the first decade of its existence as a corporate body. II.—THE COURT BOOK It is therefore in the court book of the company and in its instructions, corre- spondence, and other records suggested under the preceding classifications II and III, that its activity and methods must be found. That court books were kept under the administration of Sir Thomas Smythe is known from the receipt in the Ferrar papers, already referred to. The first book extended from January 28, 1606, to February 14, 1615, and with it were "other perticuler writings belonging to the company." The second included the period between January 31, 1615, and July 28, 1619. What these books contained can only be surmised from the scope of the two later volumes, dated April 28, 1619, to May 22, 1622, and May 20, 1622, to April 2, 1623, the contemporary copies of which are now extant and in the Library of Congress, at Washington.b b This receipt covered these four volumes, "the other perticuler writings belonging to the company," and two volumes of the court book of the Somers Islands Company, December 3, 1613, to January 24, 1620, and February 7, 1620, to February 19, 1622. However, the second volume of the court book, which is now in the Library of Congress—the fourth volume here mentioned—was continued until June 19, 1624, after the return of the records to the company. The contents of the "other perticuler writings," none of which are now known to be extant, are suggested by a memorandum of Sir Nathaniel Rich in a document among the Manchester papers. In attempting to prove the good done during Sir Thomas Smythe's administration Rich cites certain records as authority. The first one mentioned was a "booke of perticulers" con- taining the "Public workes: done in Sr T. Smithes tyme", and showing "the plenty of Armes &amp;c left in Sr Th. Smithes tyme"; the second was a "?ticular already deliuered to the Comrs." in which appeared the "Staple Co?odityes raysed in Sr T. Smithes tyme"; while the third formed a "colle? of the publi? workes made by Sr Sa. Argall wch he [comenset]" and was entitled "The ?ticulars of the Boates". Rich mentions two documents contained in this volume. He states that pages "11, 12, 13, 14, 15, &amp;c.," contain the "League of the Natiues," and that on pages 51 to 59 was "Sir T. Dales ?re." In his notes for discussion Rich also refers to "The Courte Bookes," and further declares that "Wrott remembers 4 warrants" by which lotteries were erected under the hands of the "Counsell of Virginia". In connection with the lottery he cites "th' Accompts" of Gabnell and declares that "He kept Tables".a a This paper is evidently a series of rough notes of heads and references to prove charges of mismanagement by the Sandys faction. It is in the handwriting of Sir N. Rich. List of Records, p. 167, No. 438. Thus the discovery by the Editor of these two documents in these two similar collections belonging to the hostile factions has proved that the company possessed record books; but a knowledge of their contents must be gained from other sources. To supply the loss of these documents of the company, both during the control of the council and after that control had passed into the hands of the company by virtue of the charter of 1612, there is a considerable mass of material, which affords a fair outline of the transactions of the company and the life of the colony. But much of this information is lacking in the completeness and authenticity which would have been supplied by the court book and the other records. The greatest loss is perhaps that of definite knowledge concerning the financial status of the company. The sums adventured by individuals and corporations is preserved in two alphabetical lists; but, so far as is known, only one of these lists is official, and that includes the names of the particular adventure about the year 1610.b b Brown, Genesis, I, 465–469. The other is an unpublished list apparently both incomplete and unofficial, and was probably made somewhat later than 1618 at the order of the court,c c For an act providing for such a compilation see the record of the court, Dec. 15, 1619. although the date 1618 has been assigned to it in the Manchester papers, where it is to be found.d d List of Records, p. 127, No. 58. From the records of the various London companies and from records of English towns, as also from adventures sealed to individuals by the Virginia Company, comes the most authentic information concerning the large sums invested during this decade. In a similar way the knowledge, otherwise to be found in the court book and "The ?ticulers of the Boates," concerning the ships dispatched and the sums expended for the equipment of planters, individuals, and companies, is scattering and indefinite. The broadsides issued are calls for adventurers, planters, and colonists, with the requirements or statements concerning the lottery schemes; but they do not furnish the wide information which is found in those of the later period. So far as revenue is concerned, there was probably little except that which came from new adventurers and the lotteries, but we have no way of knowing even that resource, while our knowledge of the income from tobacco and commodities brought from Virginia is derived from three or four scattering receipts only, found mostly among the papers of the Earl of De La Warr and of Lord Sackville.a a List of Records, Nos. 59, 60. Also Brown, Genesis, II, 772. Even our knowledge as to the economic condition of the colony is most indefinite and comes only from printed pamphlets issued by the company. Judging from the sources of information in the later period, this uncertainty is due to the disappearance of the letters themselves, since, after 1619, the published relations of individual planters, the declarations by the company, and even the records of the court books are all more general in character than the letters which were sent from the colony to the company. Furthermore, in the later period the daily acts of the colonists and their needs, as reported from time to time by returning ships, afforded the adventurers a body of information concerning the social condition of the colony which in form and accuracy left little to be desired. After the time of Captain John Smith not much was accurately known of the colony until the year 1617, when Captain John Rolfe and Ralph Hamor supplied statistics as to the numbers, condi- tion, settlements, and resources of the colony as it then was. The individual enterprises of this decade in the life of the company are altogether unknown, except from a few contracts for shipping found here and there. Such movements must at least have been noted in the court book. Of the first "hundred," established in 1618, nothing is recorded except the single report, heretofore unknown,b b Ibid., No. 76. This is among the Ferrar papers of Magdalene College, Cambridge. of a meeting of the committee for Smythes Hundred. But the greatest loss which we suffer through the disappearance of the court book is that of material which should throw light on the aims, motives, and unsuccessful efforts of the company and on the struggles and difficulties through which it passed. For example, there is a single reference to an attempt to found a college, but no infor- mation whatever on the subject. The factions which developed and which resulted finally in the dissolution of the company evidently existed in this period, for a letter from Chamberlain to Carleton, dated May 8, 1619,c c Ibid., No. 108. in which he speaks of the failure to reelect Sir Thomas Smythe as treasurer of the Virginia Company as having been "somewhat bettered at a later meeting of the Summers Island Company by his choice as treasurer of that company," proves that the change was due to factional differences, although the extant court books open with the refusal of Sir Thomas Smythe to continue as treasurer. Similarly, the choice of officers for the company, the votes received by each candidate, the appointments to positions in the colony, the petitions to the company and its action thereupon, and numerous other acts, revealing the relations and attitude of the individual members, are all unknown.a a Scattering information of such a character concerning this period appears in the discussions and quarrels recorded in the later court books. III.—DOCUMENTS ISSUED BY THE COMPANY Of the official documents issued by the company during the decade from 1609 to 1619 the most important have been unknown up to this time. They include the first instructions ever given to a governor of a colony by an English administrative body, and the records of the first suits entered by the company in chancery for the purpose of enforcing the payments of sums adventured in the company and of securing a part of the income from the lottery, which the company claimed had been withheld by the agent, William Leveson.b b List of Records, pp. 123–124, Nos. 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31. There are three cases recorded in the chancery proceedings in which the company attempted to enforce the payment of adventured sums. The bill of complaint is identical in each case, with the exception of the names of the defendant and the sums they underwrote. The bill, dated April 28, 1613, against Sir Henry Nevile, Sir Henry Carye, and eighteen others is printed in Brown's Genesis of the United States, II, pp. 623–631, from a copy found among the Smyth of Nibley papers. It differs slightly in orthography only from the original record. The five recorded answers supply even more valuable information than the bills of complaints. The knowledge which the administrators of the affairs of the company had gained from the early settlers, and their grasp of the necessities for exploration, for trade, and for the conduct of affairs in the plantation, has hitherto been a matter of surmise based on the relations of the planters. From the "Instruc?ons, orders, and constitu?ons to Sir Thomas Gates,"c c This manuscript is in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, Ashmolean Manuscripts, 1147, folios 175–190a. It was discovered by the Editor in October, 1903. See also List of Records, p. 122, No. 10. in May, 1609, and a similar document given to "Sir Thos. West Knight Lo:Lawarr"d d Ashmolean Manuscripts, 1147, folios 191–205a. See also List of Records, p. 122, No. 11. in 1609 or 1610 comes a revelation of the motives of the adventurers, as well as of the policy adopted and of the methods outlined for the prosecution of their efforts. These instructions to Gates and De La Warr afforded the authority for the termination of the previous govern- ment in Virginia, the stated ideas of the company as to locations for settlements, forts, and magazines, and concerning journeys inland. It also included an interesting reference to Raleigh's colonists. The general policy in administering the affairs of the colonists and the detailed orders as to the relations with the Indians, as far as they concern guards, trade, and treaties, and the daily life of the inhabitants, indicate a definiteness in the control of the company which formerly was not understood. In such a revelation of the knowledge of the country and of the natives there is a basis for belief that the affairs of the company were managed and its records were kept in a systematic and businesslike way.a a Care on the part of the company is also seen in the general instructions of 1609 to the lieutenant- governor of Virginia, which are known only through a copy of the sixth article, preserved in the paper of the Marquis of Lansdowne. Ibid., No. 9. The company had become convinced that the policy of John Smith was a wise one, and hence it ordered that a number of plantations should be settled and that efforts should be immediately directed to building healthful and sufficient houses and to planting widely enough for the self-support of the community. Here was the germ which was to develop into the colony, but the plan was as yet by no means so far-reaching. A common store, a common magazine, common refectories, labor by groups with a superintendent for each five or six persons, the prohibition of trade with the Indians except through the truck merchant were economic methods which looked to the gain of the adventurer in London rather than to the develop- ment of a colonial settlement. When the settlers had become self-supporting and capable of defense, then measures were to be taken to provide returns, so "that our fleetes come not home empty." Discovery of the seas and of royal mines, exchange of commodities, the exaction of tribute, and the development of the resources of the country for the purpose of securing "wines, pitche, Tarre, sope-ashes, Steele, Iron, Pipestaues, hempe, flaxe," silk grass, fishing for pearls, cod, and sturgeon were to be the sources of revenue. The instructions placed authority implicitly in the hands of the governor, who was expected to hear, but not necessarily to heed, the advice of the council and to judge according to "naturall right and equity then vppon the nicenes of the lawe." The agents of the corporation—the governor and his council in Virginia—received their authorization for the exercise of judicial as well as legislative powers through a commission. The one issued to Sir Thomas Gates is lost, but doubtless is as similar to that given to Lord La Warrb b The commission bears the date February 28, 1610. It is printed in full in Brown, Genesis, I, 376–384. as are his instructions. With the exception of a set of "Instructions for such things as are to be sente from Virginia, 1610,"c c Printed in full in Brown, Genesis, I, 384–386. these orders and commissions are the only documents which show anything of the direct authority exercised by the company over affairs in the plantation until the issue of the "Great Charter of privileges, orders, and Lawes" in November, 1618.d d Post, p. 34. This set of instructions to Governor George Yeardley, although given late in 1618, belongs both in spirit and effect to the period of the Sandys-Southampton administration. Otherwise, the whole course of the activity of the company under Sir Thomas Smythe was in strong contrast with the work of Sir Edwin Sandys. It was a con- tinual struggle to arouse such interest in the scheme as would result in investment. The problem of marketing the products of the colony, which concerned the later company, did not arise until toward the close of the period, when a single unsuccessful effort was made to gain a monopoly of the sale of tobacco. In order to increase the capital stock, the company made personal appeals and issued printed statements and descriptions which it scattered broadly. The story is told in the lists of adventurers cited above, in the earnest endeavors to secure new planters and new adventures from individual town and guild, in the efforts to enforce the payment of sums already adventured, in a few receipts concerning tobacco, in the lottery schemes, which were legalized by the charter of 1612, and in printed broadsides and declarations. Thus the sums adventured by individuals, by the various London companies, and by the towns of England are given in a series of requests for adventure and in bills of adventurea a For the text of these adventures, see Brown, Genesis, I, 238, 252–3, 308, 391–2 (has signature of secretary and seal of company), 452–3, 453–4, 461–2, 463–5; II, 496 (signature and seal), 555. For two not yet published see List of Records, pp. 122, 123, Nos. 16, 17, 23. issued by the company and found in the records of those companies and townsb b For this series of about 30 records see Brown, Genesis, I, 254, 257, 257–8, 277, 277–8, 278, 280–2, 291, 292–3, 302–6, 306–7, 309–10, 388–9, 390, 344; II, 558–9, 560, 561, 592, 686–8, 690–1, 768–9, 757. Also List of Records, p. 122, No. 15. as also in private collections. The chancery proceedings, in three suits, state that the company attempted to secure an adventure of £18,000 and the equipment of 600 men during the year 1611, and the failure to accomplish its purpose was set forth by the defendants as a reason for refusing to pay the sums adventured. Incidentally there was mentioned an income in the year 1613 of £8,000 from the lottery, of £2,000 from the sale of the Somers Islands, and of £600 or £800 from the disposal of the ship De La Warr.c c Ibid., Nos. 21, 22, 25, 27, 31. However, with the exception of an unpublished letter from Sandys to the mayor of Sandwichd d Printed in Brown, Genesis, I, 461–2, 463–5. concerning the adventure by that town, in which he inclosed a list of the subscribers to that particular adventure, with the sums set down by each,e e The list is printed in full in Brown, Genesis, I, 465–9. the official records reveal but little as to the sums which must have been received by the company. In a similar manner there are unauthentic records of economic value concerning the lotteries and the importation of tobacco. Of the latter a few receipts and mem- oranda among the papers of Lord Sackvillef f List of Records, p. 127, No. 59. and the Earl De La Warrg g Ibid., No. 35, 60, and Brown, Genesis, II, 772. See also reference to payments for tobacco sent to Virginia in the List of Records, p. 122, No. 13. are positively all there is in existence relating to the origin of a trade which was estimated in 1619 to be worth £100,000. Of the former, there is a "Declaration for the Lottery," published in 1615 by the company, and an order of the Privy Council, together with letters urging the towns of the Kingdom to adventure in this the second great lottery of the company.a a Brown, Genesis, II, 760–766. For unpublished letters, see List of Records, p. 124, Nos. 32, 33, 34. A letter from the governor of the Virginia Company to the mayor and aldermen of Ipswichb b Ibid., No. 71. is to the same effect, but none of these documents tell of the income therefrom. The only record which will give an idea of the value of the first lottery is in the chancery proceedings, and relates to a suit of the company with William Leveson to secure moneys from the lottery,c c Ibid., No. 28. in which the sum received in 1613 is here stated to have been £2,793 and 10 shillings. The answer of Leveson is of further interest in that it alone tells of the methods by which the business was conducted and of the house built for the lottery west of St. Paul's Church. V.—PUBLICATIONS OF THE COMPANYd d Because of the close relation of the publications of the company to the documents issued by the company, the discussion of Class V precedes that of Class IV. The struggle for capital and for settlers before 1616 is most apparent from the advertisements that were issued. The broadsides of the years 1609, 1610, and 1611 are printed as official declarations of an intention on the part of the company to send voyages to Virginia, and contain the necessary information as to the classes of emigrants wanted—artificers only—and the conditions and rewards for emigration. The broadside of February, 1611, is of most value, in that the classes of emigrants with the numbers of each desired are specified, while that of 1610 is a defense against the slander of recently returned colonists, and emphasizes the former need of artificers as colonists.e e These are all reprinted in Brown, Genesis, I, (1) 248–249, (2) 354–356, (3) 439, (4) 445, (5) 469–470. The broadsides of 1613 and 1615 concern the drawing of the lotteries, the latter declaring in a general way the prosperous condition of the country and announcing the prizes and rewards, thus affording some conception of the sums received from such an enterprise.f f Brown, Genesis, I, 608, 761–765. The publications of the year 1616 disclose, as well as assert, the prosperity of the settlement and the assurance of its success, though giving no statistical information. That of April arranges for the first division of lands among old adventurers and promises the same to new adven- turers, declaring the intention to send a new governor and surveyors to the colony for the purpose, while that of the winter of the same year announces that any settlers may return to England who will.a a Brown, Genesis, I, 774–779, 797–799. In addition to the advertisements for investment and adventure, both of person and of money, the company put forth a series of publications, consisting of four sermons preached before the company at stated intervals, intended to arouse both interest and confidence in their undertaking. These afford but little if any definite information, but reveal the spirit of the times, as also the lines of criticism and resistance which the company had continually to meet.b b Brown, Genesis, I, (1) 282; (2) 293; (3) 312–316; (4) 360–373. A fourth sermon preached by Richard Crakanthorpe, March 24, 1608/9, on the anniversary of the accession of James I, has favorable references to the project. See Brown, Genesis, I. 255–256. But of far greater importance to a comprehension of the attitude of the com- pany, and especially of the progress of the plantation, are the declarations concern- ing the colony, which were published by the company.c c Brown either reprints all of these or cites the reference. Genesis, I, (1) 241–243; (2) 279–280; (3) 337–353; (4) 420–426; (5) 427–428; (6) 477–478; II, (7) 558–559; (7) 577–588, 611–620; (9) 746–747. They are nine in number, and bear the following titles and dates: (1)Nova Britannia. London, 1609. (2)Virginia richly valued. London, April 15, 1609. (3)A True and sincere declaration of the purpose and ends of the Plantation, "by the authority of the Governor and Councellors of the Plantation." London, 1610. [December 14, 1609.] (4)Nevves from Virginia—a poem. 1610. (5)A True declaration of the estate of the colony of Virginia, by the order of the "Councell of Virginia." London, 1610. (6)De La Warr's Relation. London, July 6, 1611, with Crashaw's Epistle Dedicatorie as a preface. (7)The New life of Virginea—second part of Noua Britannia, by "the Coun- sell of Virginea." London, May 1, 1612. (8)Good Newes from Virginia, by Whittaker. London, 1613. (9)A booke called an narracon of the present State of Virginia by Ralph Hammer. London, 1615. The documents published in 1609 and also the poem of 1610 were efforts on the part of the company to defend itself against charges of failure in earlier years and to reveal the advantages which were promised under the new system of government. This is distinctly the tone and motive of the Nova Britannia, in which appear argu- ments in favor of the colony, and the statements of the plans, resources, and needs of the colony, together with an outline of the government which was now to be administered. A True and sincere declaration further explains the unsatisfactory condition of the colony by reference to the incompetence of previous governors, furnishing perhaps the best historical narrative which was issued by the company during the first period of the plantation. It also holds out the promise of improved conditions under Gates and De La Warr, who are to be shortly sent to Virginia with a complete outfit of men and provisions. The second document describes the southern part of the country and cites the advantages of Florida as evidence of the opportunities in Virginia. After the time of De La Warr the published accounts of the plans, movements, and successes of the colonists became more complete. While the state- ments of De La Warr in his Relation are a bare outline of the conditions as he found them and the improvements in trade and discovery to which Captain Argall had contributed, together with his lordship's plans for the future, it is of value as forming, with Hamor's narrative four years later, a surprisingly accurate and satisfactory treatment of the development in the colony during those years. Hamor gives a clear statement of the methods and success of Captain Dale in his relations with the Indians, of his organization and reform of the colony, and of his establishment of order therein, and reveals clearly the state of affairs on the arrival of Gates, the cause of the failure heretofore, and the details of the building of the successive towns, with descriptions and statistics for each. He gives also an his- torical narrative of the relations with the various Indian tribes and his knowledge and statements concerning the resources of the country are equally satisfactory. While Whittaker's Good Newes from Virginia and The New Life of Virginea are of value as corroborative evidence, they add but little to the knowledge of condi- tions or resources, and evidently were written more in the spirit of the poem of 1610, being intended to inspire confidence in the management of the colony, in the new system, and in the officers installed, as well as to arouse enthusiasm in the project. It is evident that these publications are of more direct value in the study of the progress of the colony and tell at first hand but little more than the methods employed by the company to gain its end, but, together with the other reports from the colony which are preserved in manuscript form, they to an extent supply what has been lost by the disappearance of the court book. They prove that there was a gradual change in the motive and means of the company, due entirely to the exigencies of the case. The failure to discover precious metals forced the company to concern itself with the development of the resources of the country and with the production of staple articles which were needed in England. Then, too, the first written laws promulgated by Gates, De La Warr, and Dale in 1610–1612, martial in form and harsh in character, reveal the type of the plantation which the company now proposed;a a For the Colony of Virginea Britannia, Lawes Divine, Morall and Martiall, &amp;c., entered for publica- tion on December 13, 1611, is a code first established by Sir Thomas Gates, May 24, 1610, approved by the lord governor, June 12, 1610, and exemplified and enlarged by Sir Thomas Dale, June 22, 1611. They are reprinted in Force, Tracts, Vol. III. the freedom of the individual was to be reduced to a minimum, all labor was to be regulated as if it were a military discipline and the produce was to belong to the common store. Thus the evils of the early settlement were to be avoided. But of necessity this plan was temporary. Argall, like Smith, was a good colonizer. The explorations of Smith and his trade with the Indians, together with the order and prosperity which were brought by Dale, resulted in the founding of various settlements, such as Henrico and others farther south, which became self-supporting and independent of the "supplies" from England. This meant that the company was to be forced to assume a different attitude toward the colony; that the common labor, common store, and common trade must be abandoned. By 1614 private lands had been given to a few inhabitants, every family had been assured of a house of four rooms, rent free, for one year, and women had been sent to the colony to aid in keeping the settlers contented and permanent. Whether the company made any resistance to this development within the set- tlement, by which the adventurer in London must share the profit with the planter, will only be known when the court book shall have been discovered, but it is certain that by 1616 the point of view of the leaders of the company had changed. They had then come to realize that they were to be the middlemen for the marketing of the produce of the planters. This is proved by the movement in 1616 for the monopoly of the importation of the only lucrative staple, tobacco. Again, in 1619, when the time for free importation from the plantation had expired, they most eagerly sought an adjustment with the Crown, although, in 1614, Sir Edwin Sandys, by this time the leading spirit in the company, had been the chairman in the House committee which reported against monopolies. To such an extent had the colony now grown that the instructions given to Sir George Yeardley in November, 1618, called "The Great Charter of privileges, orders, and Lawes," recognized the necessity for local government. They provided for two houses, the "Council of State," to be chosen by the company in its quarter court, and the general assembly, to consist "of the Council of State and two Burgesses chosen out of each Town Hundred or other particular Plantation."a a List of Records, p. 129, No. 72. The great dif- ference between this act of the company and that of nine years before, when the instructions to Gates were issued and the laws of Dale were approved, is apparent. Whether it was due entirely to the necessities arising from the changed conditions in the colony heretofore noted or to the abuse of power by Samuel Argall, from 1616 to 1619, is uncertain.b b There are extracts from two letters dealing with the alleged misappropriations and abuse of power by Captain Argall, deputy governor from May, 1617, to April 20, 1619. One of these was addressed to Captain Argall and bears the date August 22, 1618; the other to Lord De La Warr, August 23, 1618. They are preserved in the court book of the company under the date of June 19, 1622. See also Ibid., Nos. 82, 83. Whether it was but a reflection of the growing popular senti- ment within the company by which the generality exercised the powers of adminis- tration or whether it was due to the influence of the "opposition" in parliament can not be settled without fuller records than are at present extant. IV.—LETTERS FROM THE PLANTERS AND RECORDS OF THE COLONY The printed reports from the colonists and the printed declarations of the company were of course based on the letters from the planters and on those from the governor and council of Virginia to the Virginia Company. There were also letters from indi- viduals in the colony to officers of the company or to other adventurers in England. They may perhaps reveal more clearly the condition of affairs in the colony and the influences which moved the company in its change of policy, since they do not attempt to conceal, excuse, or palliate any of the circumstances. Six of these narrate the story of the voyage of Gates and Somers, the misery in the plantation on the arrival of Gates and of De La Warr in 1610, and the steps that were taken to improve con- ditions.c c These letters were from the governor and council, July 7, 1610; from John Radcliffe, October 4, 1609, Gabriel Archer, August 31, 1609, and from Captain Somers and Lord La Warr, August, 1610, to the Earl of Salisbury; and from William Strachey in A True Repertory, July 15, 1610. They are reprinted in Brown, Genesis, I, 328–332, 400–402, 402–413, 416–417. Through other letters from the colony the company gained its knowledge respecting voyages to Virginia, progress and order in the colony, and the building of Jamestown,d d See Strachey, A True Repertory, in Purchas, His Pilgrimes, IV, pp. 1734–1756. especially under Sir Thomas Dale, and as to the prosperity of the settlers. Dale in 1611, outlined his plans and his achievements, urged the sending of 2,000 men, and suggested that the difficulty of securing planters might be overcome by making the settlement a penal colony. In 1615, 1616, and 1617 the company received reassurances from Dale, Hamor, and Rolfe of the prosperity of the colony; but the publications of the company and the letters from the colony from 1615 to 1618 were either very few in number, or have not been preserved. These were the years of the excessive abuses in the colony under Sir Samuel Argall.a a For the log book of Argall and for these letters from Spelman, Dale, Argall, and Rolfe, see Brown, Genesis, I, 428–439, 483–488, 488–494, 501–508; II, 639–640: Virginia Magazine of History, IV, 28, 29; X, 134–138. Also noted in the List of Records post, p. 125, Nos. 39, 40. The only evidence of records kept by the colonists is an abstract of "A Register book during the Go?mt of Saml Argall Esqr admiral, and for ye time present, prin- cipal Gour of Virga" in the year 1618. This abstract was probably made in 1730 under the direction of R. Hickman, deputy clerk of the general court of Virginia at that time, and has heretofore been unnoticed. From it comes a knowledge of correspondence between the governor and Bermuda Hundred and Kicoughtan, and between the governor and the company in London. A complaint of the largeness of privilege given to Captain Martin in his grant is significant because of the long con- test during later years, between the company and Captain Martin over this patent. There are, too, a number of commissions to officers for trade and for command, and several warrants, edicts, and proclamations. These are very similar in character to those issued by the governor and council in 1623, and reveal the fact that methods of government had not altered materially, though the source of authority had been changed by the great charter of 1618. The severity of penalty and the threats of reduction to slavery for offense are perhaps the features most characteristic of the period.b b For full citation of these abstracts of about twenty documents, see Ibid., Nos. 40, 42–48, 50– 52, 55–57, 64, 65, 67, 74, 75. VI.—PRIVATE PAPERS OF ADVENTURERS While the company probably did not officially use the private correspondence received from the colony by individual adventurers, it doubtless profited by the information which it contained. Thus, the relation of John Rolfe,c c Reprinted in the Virginia Historical Register, I. addressed to Lord Rich and the King in 1616, ranked in value with the descriptions of Ralph Hamor, for it discussed the water supply of the colony, its food, clothing, houses, and government and gave statistical information as to the various towns, their location, the number of their inhabitants, and their officers. There are at least six other letters extant, similar in character, though of less value.d d (1) Sir Samuell Argall to Nicholas Hawes, June, 1613; (2) Whittaker to Crashaw, August 9, 1611; (3) Percy to Northumberland, August 17, 1611; (4) Dale to Winwood, June 3, 1616; (5) Dale to D. M., June 18, 1614; (6) Whittaker to Master G., June 18, 1614. See Brown, Genesis, I, (1) 640–644; (2) 497–500; (3) 500–501; II, (4) 780–782; (5) 747; (6) 747. But another series of private papers partakes most strongly of the nature of documents of the company. These are the contracts and correspondence relating to individual adventures to Virginia or to groups of adventurers. They indicate a tendency in the company to grant private monopolies and to encourage private settlements—measures which indicate the growing importance of the undertaking and the development of individual trade. Only one series of documents relating to individual adventures is extant, those by which Lord Zouch's investment in Virginia was secured to him. His contracts were made in May, 1618, with John Bargrave and James Brett. There is also his warrant to John Fenner to pass to Virginia and trade with the colony and the savages in his pinnace Silver Falcon, in February, 1618/19.a a For these documents see List of Records, p. 129, Nos. 77, 82, 98, 99. The other series of documents, which illustrate the legal forms and methods of the company, as also the way in which the first plantations were undertaken by private means, concern Smythe's Hundred and Berkeley Hundred. Among the Ferrar papers are the minutes of the meeting of the committee for Smythe's Hundred on May 8, 1618,b b Ibid., No. 76. the first record concerning the hundred, which provides for the sending out and equipment of thirty-five men at an expense of £657 9s. 4d. VII.—SUPPLEMENTARY CONTEMPORARY CORRESPONDENCE AND RECORDS In addition to the documents which are either official records or similar to such records in character, there is a large amount of correspondence between officers of state in England and other individuals which by its reference throws light on the affairs of the company or gives additional or corroborative data. All of this which is earlier in date than 1616 has been published by Alexander Brown. There are seven letters, the dates of which fall between 1616 and 1619, that are of the same character; but they add nothing in fact to the other documents, although two of them reveal the measures taken even at this early date to impress youths and maidens for Virginia and to send reprieved prisoners to the colony.c c Ibid., Nos. 84, 85, 88, 89, 96. Of the documents of this character, which are given by Brown, perhaps the correspond- ence between the Spanish ambassador in London and the King of Spain is the most valuable, not in the trustworthiness of the data—though much of it confirms other sources—but in the revelation it contains of the part that Spanish relations played in the development of the company and especially in its decline during the follow- ing decade, while its reference to prevalent rumors, reports, and sentiment are extremely illuminating. There are thirty-seven of these documents in all, including the correspondence concerning the Spanish ship Chaloner. The Chamberlain-Carleton, Digby-Salisbury, Cottington-Salisbury, and Lee-Wilson correspondence add occa- sional data and serve to fix dates and facts which are known from other sources.a a See Brown, Genesis, "Table of Contents." Of similar value are the chronicles of Howes, Abbot's Geography, Smith's Map of England and his General History, the Commons Journal, the writings of Sir Fer- dinando Gorges, and other material which emanated from the Plymouth adventurers.a 3. The Collections of Documents, 1616–1624 General Character of the Records The character of the documents of the company after 1619 is fundamentally the same as in the preceding decade. Virginia was still a proprietary province with a commercial company as an overlord, and therefore the company was still the immediate source of all government in the colony. To it came all appeals from colonial authorities; it exercised control over all commerce, both from and to Virginia; it granted all land and all privileges. Although the number of doc- uments emanating from the Crowna a See documents under Class I in the List of Records. —that is, of the first class—is large, they are rather an indication of the increasing wealth and importance of the company, than of royal interference. They concern the regulation of trade, complain of the abuse of power by the company, or provide for the investigation of its acts rather than assume any authority in the direct administration of its affairs. In them interference in the management is foreshadowed, but it is not until the dissolution of the company that the Crown again becomes the proprietor. The mass of materials which form the records for this period is much greater than in the earlier decade. This is due on the one hand to their preservation in two or three collections, and on the other especially to the vast growth of business in the company and the rapid development from a colony for exploitation into a colony for settlement. Thus the minutes of the company, forming the second class of documents, show that it conducted a larger amount of business than any other proprietary company.b b For this statement, as also for a full understanding of the character of the company, see The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century, I, 61. These minutes comprise two large volumes of the court book, and fill 741 manuscript pages.c c Grouped under Class II in the List of Records. In the third class there are nine letters from the company to the governor and council in the colony, and twelve from the latter body to the company, in addition to a large number of receipts, commissions, instructions, and laws.d d Ibid., Class III. A mass of material belonging distinctly to the plantation serves as a part of the records of the company and at the same time furnishes the story of the beginning of the political unity of the colony. This group consists of the "court booke" of the council of the colony during the last year of the authority of the company, covering about 65 pages; 54 commissions, orders, proclamations, and warrants to subordinates in the colony issued by the governor and council in Virginia, and 35 petitions to the same body from the members of the colony.a a Grouped under Class IV in the List of Records. These papers are all in the Library of Congress. The publica- tions of the company for this final period of its existence number 3 large broadsides, 11 declarations containing 168 printed pages, and 4 sermons and treatises made up of 150 pages.b b Ibid., Class V. The supplementary official material found in the correspondence between individuals of the company and of the colony or between members of the company in England, in addition to the records of the private companies within the larger body, includes many documents and memo- randa.c c Ibid., Class VI. Sixty-six of these are preserved in the Manchester papers, while 78 are from the Ferrar papers, which are now first made known and published. The unofficial material, consisting of records of other companies, of towns, and of correspondence touching on the affairs of the company or colony, numbers about 40 documents.d d Ibid., Class VII. The relative value of the various classes of the records for this period has been altered by the preservation of the court book which has made the other material supplementary, or even subsidiary, with the exception of the correspond- ence; for in it is either recorded or summarized the information which the company had received from all other sources, or which it imparted to individuals or to the public by other means. But the fact that the other records are supplementary does not decrease their value, for they often furnish the data which are the basis of the acts and conclusions of the company, while some of them also reveal the legal or political processes of the company, of the colony, of the courts, or of the sovereign authority, and others are of great value in the light which they throw on the dissenting party within the company. The subject-matter of the court book, as well as the character and contents of the various documents, proves the changed condition which the increase of business had brought about, since a large proportion of the records deal with the founding and conducting of private enterprises, and many of them are really documents of a private nature. It is apparent that the company still looked upon the colony as a source of income for the investors, but that the ulterior object had become the development of the resources of Virginia instead of the produc- tion of wealth through mines and the opening of new trade routes. As a result of this change in commercial object had come the need of larger, more numerous, and more scattered settlements in the colony, and of greater co-operation on the part of the settlers, although it may well be claimed that the latter necessity had been urged upon the leaders by the mismanagement of Captain Argall during the three years previous to the change in administration. In order to increase the number of planters, concessions of privilege had been made to private parties or groups as early as 1618, since such investments were doubtless easier to secure when the adventure was under the immediate control of the undertaker. Simi- larly, for the purpose of stimulating capital and gaining the co-operation of the planters, the division of land, promised in 1609, was proclaimed in 1616. Free tenancy was now guaranteed to all individuals, even to indented servants, at the expiration of seven years. The organization of joint stock companies for the manage- ment of trade, which supplanted the magazine, was a movement toward private enter- prize. Hence it is that these subjects, together with those which concern the impor- tation and sale of tobacco, occupy the greater part of the court book, and must have consumed most of the attention of the corporation. The burden of discussion in the courts concerned the best means of marketing the products, whereas in the earlier decade it must have related to the increase of capital. The records of the colony were no longer simple reports to the company and instructions from the proprietor, but assumed the character of political documents, since liberty of land and trade, and the creation of numerous plantations and scattered settlements resulted in the growth of "political conditions and forces side by side with the commercial and economic." The minutes of the colonial legislative assembly, the records of the colonial court, the petitions to the governor and council, and the commissions and orders granted by that body are all distinctively new features in the records. Here is evidence of the crea- tion of the colony, with its body of free citizens, out of the plantation, with its body of half-servile laborers. THE JEFFERSON LIBRARY IN THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS The records of the company under the administration of Sir Edwin Sandys and the Earl of Southampton, or the copies of them so far as extant, are to-day scattered among many public and private collections both in England and in America. The Library of Congress at Washington possesses by far the largest and most impor- tant collection in this country. It contains the contemporary certified copy of the court book from 1619 to 1624, as well as a mass of original correspondence, or contemporary copies of the same, between the company and the council in Virginia. It also includes many original records of the colony, many eighteenth century tran- scripts of the original commissions, patents, and other records, and many recent transcripts and photographs of documents in the collections of England. The eighteenth century transcripts and the original documents and contemporary copies came to the Library of Congress from Thomas Jefferson's collection in two different groups: the first in 1815, when his library, purchased "in a lump as it stood on the catalogue,"a a Manuscript letters of Thomas Jefferson in the Library of Congress. In this letter to William Hening, March 11, 1815, from Monticello, Mr. Jefferson stated that he could not retain a volume, since Congress had purchased his library. was secured by Congress for the sum of $23,950; the second was secured when the books of Mr. Jefferson were sold at auction subsequent to his death in 1826. The catalogue of the auction sale classified those acquired by the Library of Congress at the latter date under two numbers as follows:b b The "Catalogue. President Jefferson's library — (as arranged by himself,) — to be sold at auction, at the Long Room, Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington — —–, 27th of February, 1829, — —," p. 4, is in the Library of Congress, Miscellaneous Pamphlets, Vol. 859, No. 14. "No. 121. Records of the Virginia Company, 2 vols., fol. MS. (the authentic copy mentioned in Stith's History). "No. 122. Old Records of Virginia, 4 vols. fol. MS. viz: "A.Letters, proclamations in 1622–23, and correspondence 1625. (42) Transactions in council and assembly, their petition and his majesty's answer.c c This is classified as one folio manuscript in the catalogue of the Library of Congress, 1830, and the latter is doubtless the manuscript covering the period from 1626–1634. "B.(9). Orders from Feb. 1622 to Nov. 1627.d d This manuscript also contains loose papers to 1632. "C.(32) A. Foreign business and Inquisitions from 1665 to 1676. Transactions of the council from Dec. 9, 1698, to May 20, 1700."e e Catalogue of the Library of Congress, 1830, p. 167. The volumes of Jefferson manuscripts relating to the company, which became the property of the Government in 1815, were as follows: (1)First laws made by the Assembly in Va. anno 1623.f f Catalogue of the Library of Congress, 1815, p. 73. (Used by Hening.) (2)Journal of the Council and Assembly, 1626–1634. (Used by Hening.)g g This is probably the same manuscript as that mentioned above under the Jefferson catalogue as No. 122 (42). There is no other manuscript in the Library which corresponds to the title here given or to the description above. (3)Miscellaneous Records, 1606–1692, with a small quarto containing abstracts of Rolls in the offices of State bound into the volume. (Commonly known as the Bland copy, because so cited by Hening.) (4)Miscellaneous Papers, 1606–1683. Instructions, Commi?ons letters of Advice and admonitions and Public Speeches, Proclamations &amp;c. Collected, transcribed and diligently examined by the Originall Records, now extant, belonging to the Assemblie. The entire set in the first group, acquired in 1829, is composed either of original documents or of contemporary transcripts, while the second paper of the second group belongs to the same period. The Miscellaneous Papers, 1606–1683, are a seventeenth century transcript. The Laws of 1623 and the Miscellaneous Records, 1606–1692, are transcripts of the early eighteenth century and are attested by R. Hickman, who was clerk of the general court in 1722. The origin and identification of these various volumes, together with a later copy of the court book of the com- pany, now in the library of the Virginia Historical Society and commonly known as the [John] Randolph [of Roanoke] copy, has been a subject of doubt and discussion, arising from the conflicting descriptions of the volumes by the early historians of Virginia, William Stith and John D. Burk, and by the editor of many of the documents in 1809, William Hening. The following statements with regard to the first group made by Mr. Jefferson in a letter to Hugh P. Taylor, October 4, 1825,a a From the National Intelligencer, October 19, 1825. will serve as a basis for the attempt to ascertain the history and authenticity of those manuscripts: "The only manuscripts I now possess relating to the antiquities of our country are some folio volumes: Two of these are the proceeding[s] of the Virginia company in England; the remaining four are of the Records of the Council of Virginia, from 1622 to 1700. The account of the first two volumes, you will see in the preface to Stiths History of Virginia. They contain the records of the Virginia Company, copied from the originals, under the eye, if I recollect rightly, of the Earl of South- ampton, a member of the company, bought at the sale of his library by Doctor Byrd, of Westover, and sold with that library to Isaac Zane. These volumes happened at the time of the sale, to have been borrowed by Col. R. Bland,b b Col. R. Bland died October 26, 1776. whose library I purchased, and with this they were sent to me. I gave notice of it to Mr. Zane, but he never reclaimed them. "The other four volumes, I am confident, are the original office records of the council. My conjectures are, that when Sir John Randolph was about to begin the History of Virginia which he meant to write, he borrowed these volumes from the council office to collect from them materials for his work. He died before he had made any progress in that work, and they remained in his library, probably unobserved, during the whole life of the late Peyton Randolph, his son. From his executor, I purchased his library, in a lump, and these volumes, were sent to me as a part of it. I found the leaves so rotten as often to crumble into dust on being handled; I bound them, therefore together, that they might not be unnecessarily opened; and have thus preserved them forty-seven years." CONTEMPORARY COPY OF THE COURT BOOK The two volumes referred to by Mr. Jefferson as the "proceedings of the Virginia Company in England" are the contemporary copies of the court book which were secured by the Hon. William Byrd, of Westover, Virginia, from the estate of the Earl of Southampton, either at the time of his death in 1667 or later. Since Mr. Byrd was a boy of 15 living in London in 1667, it may have been when the Virginia estates were left him in 1671, or even in 1687 when he made a visit to England, that he made the purchase.a a William Byrd died December 4, 1704. See Byrd, History of the Dividing Line. That the books remained in the possession of the descendants of Mr. Byrd for a century is proved by the fact that they are mentioned in a manuscript catalogue of the library of the third William Byrd, who died in 1777,b b "Catalogue of the Books in the Library at Westover belonging to William Byrd, Esqr.," p. 437, in The Writings of Colonel William Byrd, edited by J. S. Bassett. but these two volumes were not in the library of Colonel Byrd, when it was sold by his widow in Philadelphia to Isaac Zane. Mr. Jefferson's statement that he purchased them from Colonel Bland may be accepted,c c For a description of these volumes and the circumstances of their making, see the discussion, pp. 78–84, post. but it would be difficult to prove whether he is equally reliable when he states that the volumes had been loaned to Colonel Bland and had not been returned by him to Colonel Byrd, or whether Mr. Deane is correct in saying that Colonel Bland, as an antiquary, had secured them. That Stith used these contempo- rary copies of the court book in his History of Virginia is apparent from his description of them, as also from his statement that they had been communicated to him by the "late worthy president of our council, the Hon. William Byrd, esq."d d It is hardly possible that Mr. Jefferson's statement is incorrect and that, instead of having been acquired by Col. Richard Bland at that time, they passed from Stith to his brother-in-law, Peyton Randolph, and with the library of the latter to Jefferson. This is one of the solutions suggested by Justin Winsor. See Narrative and Critical History of the United States, III, 158. MANUSCRIPT RECORDS OF THE COMPANY, VOLUME III The other manuscript volumes, which the Library of Congress acquired from Mr. Jefferson and which are included under No. 122 of the Jefferson catalogue, belong to the early seventeenth century. They are the documents which Mr. Jefferson referred to in his letter to Mr. Taylor as having come from the library of the Hon. Peyton Randolph in such a fragile condition, and which in a letter to Mr. Wythe, of January 16, 1795, urging the necessity of publishing the laws of Virginia, he describes in a similar way.e e Hening, Statutes at Large, I, p. viii. That these are the papers discussed by Stith is proved by comparing them with the Hickman (Bland) transcripts. In his preface, Stith confirms the description by Mr. Jefferson, but he apparently destroys the latter's theory that the papers had been in the possession of Peyton Randolph since the death of Sir John Randolph in 1736. Mr. Stith wrote his preface in 1746, and suggests that they were at that time in the possession of the House of Burgesses, although he does not make a positive statement to that effect. His assertions are worth recording, since they carry the history of the volumes back thirty years and also throw light on the Hickman transcripts. "I must chiefly depend upon such of our Records, as are still extant. Many of them doubtless perished in the State-house at James-Town, and by other Accidents; and those, which have survived the Flames and Injuries of Time, have been so care- lesly kept, are so broken, interrupted, and deficient, have been so mangled by Moths and Worms, and lie in such a confused and jumbled State (at least the most ancient of them) being huddled together in single Leaves and Sheets in Books out of the Binding, that I foresee, it will cost me infinite Pains and Labour, to reduce and digest them in any tolerable Order, so as to form from them a just and connected Narration. And some of them have been lost, even since Mr. Hickman was Clerk of the Secretary's Office. For I cannot find, among the Papers in our Offices, some old Rolls, to which he refers. I have therefore been obliged, in a few Points, to depend upon the Fidelity of that Gentleman's Extracts out of our oldest Records, made for the Use of Sir John Randolph. But these things were so far from discouraging and rebuffing me, that they were rather an additional Spur to my Industry. For I thought it highly necessary, before they were entirely lost and destroyed, to apply them to their proper Use, the forming a good History. But as the House of Burgesses in a late Session, upon my shewing their moldering and dangerous State to some of the Members, have justly taken them into their Consideration, and have ordered them to be reviewed and fairly transcribed, I doubt not, by their Assistance, and with the Help of the late Sir John Randolph's Papers, and such others, as are in the Hands of private Gentlemen in the Country, and will undoubtedly be readily communicated to further so noble and so useful a Design, to be able to collect and compose a tolerably regular and complete History of our Country."a a Stith, History of Virginia preface, p. viii. Hence, we are again left in a quandary. The papers may have come into Peyton Randolph's possession through the arrangement made by the burgesses for their transcription; but no transcript made directly from the documents as late as 1746 is known to us. Whether they were borrowed from the province by Mr. Stith or by Peyton Randolph, his brother-in-law, or by some other historian or antiquarian is not yet proved; and our only evidence that Jefferson secured them from Peyton Randolph's executor is his statement made twenty years after the date of the purchase. The papers, after almost a century in the Capitol, were in a still more deplorable condition in 1901 than that described by Mr. Stith, but the loose pages have now been carefully and skillfully repaired. The order of contents of the volumes (while not chronologically arranged) may be known from the abstracts made under the direction of Hickman about 1722. This agrees with an arrangement determined by the early pagination, the subject-matter, and the writing. That these manuscripts are original records or contemporary copies is evidenced by the form of some of them, by the signatures of others, and by the autographs of the secretaries and clerks of the period. The supposition is that they escaped destruction when the Province House was burned in Bacon's rebellion in 1678, during the administration of Gooch in 1698, and again during the Revolution, only to be lost to the State in the latter half of the eighteenth century. The volume designated as 122, A, in the Jefferson catalogue, and there entitled "Letters, proclamations in 1622–23, and correspondence 1625," is evidently the one referred to by page in the Hickman abstract of the rolls as "the other side of No. A 42."a a This volume of correspondence is cited in the List of Records as the "Manuscript Records of the Virginia Company of London, Vol. III, pt. ii," thus including in Vol. III all of this miscellaneous manuscript material of the company. This abstract is a quarto bound into the Miscellaneous Records, 1606–1692, called by Hening the "Bland copy." In pages 1 to 14a of this volume are eighteen letters from the colony to the King or to the company between 1621 and 1625, while pages 15 to 30 contain nine letters from the company to the colony between 1621 and August 6, 1623. The first group are holographs, but of a secretary or clerk not yet identified. The second are doubtless in the autograph of Edward Sharpless.b b Edward Sharpless had been a clerk of the secretary of the colony, Christopher Davison, and succeeded him upon his death in the winter of 1623/4. He remained as acting secretary until his trial on May 20, 1624, for giving copies of the acts of the assembly to the commissioners of the King; John Sotherne then took up his duties. Both are contemporary copies of the originals.c c See Plates, post, Vol. II for illustrations of these holographs, and for evidence as to the autographs. The documents classed in the Jefferson catalogue as 122 (42) form the balance of this volume and also probably include the journal of the council and assembly, 1626–1634. The latter was evidently used by Hening in compiling his statutes. Presuming that this fragile document, which is the only one concerning the company and the colony while controlled by the company, formed one volume, its contents was as follows: No. A 42: 1. (a)Miscellaneous letters from the Privy Council to the governor and council in Virginia in 1623, pp. 1–3a. An unknown holograph. (b)Declarations of the condition of the colony and answers thereto in 1623/4, pp. 3a–7a. An unknown holograph. 2.Fundamental orders, charters, ordinances, and instructions by the company in London and laws of the assembly in Virginia, pp. 8–21. Partly holographs as above.a a This volume is cited in the List of Records, as "MSS. Records of the Virginia Company of Lon- don, Vol. III, pt. i." No. A 42. "The other side:" 1. (a)Letters from the colony to the King or to the company between 1621 and 1625. An unknown holograph. (b)Letters from the company to the colony between 1621 and August 6, 1623. Holographs of Edward Sharpless. 2.Instructions, commissions, proclamations, orders, warrants, and letters of the governor and captain-general of Virginia and of the assembly, pp. 36–53. Partly the holograph of Edward Sharpless and partly perhaps of Christopher Davison, the secretary of the colony from November, 1621, until his death in the winter of 1623/4.b b Christopher Davison was appointed at a quarter court, June 23, 1621.

Unknown holo- graphs similar to those in the first part of this end of the volume.c c Cited in the List of Records as "MSS. Records of the Virginia Company, Vol. III, pt. ii." The first part of the volume thus opens with the letters of the Privy Council to the colony on April 28, 1623, when the King first began the action looking toward the dissolution of the company, and with the first direct correspondence with the officers of the colony. The writing and the dates place the documents as consecutive through the entry of the acts of the assembly, March 5, 1623/4, when the assembly seems to have ceased. After that page, copies of scattered documents appear in a different writing, commencing on the back of the last assembly record. These are largely fundamental or constitutional, including the instructions of November 20, 1606, the charter of 1606, the order of 1607 enlarging the council, and the oaths administered to officials of the colony of the same period. The other part of the volume opens with the correspondence between the colony and the home government. After a hiatus of fifteen pages the documents of the governor and assembly begin as indicated under the second division above. The writing is that of Edward Sharp- less and Christopher Davison, and remains the same throughout the petitions of the next group. The last group of miscellaneous documents agrees in subject with the letters of the first part and in autograph with the first section of those letters. On a fly leaf among the loose papers is inscribed the following: "Records of W. Clay- bourne or Claiborne./ ? Joseph [Jokeg] / Tho Farloue &amp; / Vpton gent / Thos. Ba[u]rbag[e] / Cle? Con?"./ This may belong to the records of the period after May 14, 1626, when William Claybourne was appointed secretary of the colony by Charles I, or it may have been placed in an earlier volume, or it may indicate that a part at least of the earlier volume was transcribed under his direction. Section B (9) of No. 122 in the Jefferson catalogue, cited as orders from February, 1622, to November, 1627, and including loose pages as late as 1634, is the only octavo manuscript of these records and has been saved from its almost useless condition by repair. That this is the original blotter of the court book of the gover- nor and council in Virginia, containing the original record of suits tried before that body and of orders issued by it, is proved by the hasty and brief entries, giving the volume an entirely different character from those of the carefully elaborated tran- scripts of the clerks. The records of twenty-three courts held as here given and of the cases considered during the era of the authority of the company, consisting of about forty-five pages of manuscript, are noted in the list of the records of the company, but are not printed in this collection since they may be included more properly in a publication of the "Records of the Colony." THE TRANSCRIPTS OF THE VIRGINIA RECORDS RANDOLPH COPY It is now certain that at least two copies of the court book existed at the beginning of the nineteenth century, since the so-called John Randolph [of Roanoke] copy has recently come to light.a a The three volumes are in the collection of the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond, but they are so closely associated with the Library of Congress MSS. that they are discussed here rather than under the MSS. of Richmond. It bears every evidence of being an eighteenth century transcript made from the contemporary copy now in the Library of Congress; the manuscript is of the century following that of the contemporary copy; the order, paragraphing, form of insertion of documents, and material is identical; but the omissions and errors arise from illegibility in the earlier manuscript. The other differences lie in occasional carelessness by the copyist and in the fact that the abbreviations are expanded and the spelling and the capitalization are modernized. The caption of the first volume of this eighteenth century copy is as follows: "The Ancient Records of this Colony under The Treasurer and Company." It opens with "A Quarter Court held for Virginia at Sir Thomas Smith's house in Philpott Lane, 28th of April 1619," and ends on page 535 with the court of July 3, 1622. The final statement is as follows: "The rest of the Company's Acts are contained in a Second Volume." Volume II begins with a court of July 17, 1622, and closes on page 491 with the proceedings of June 7, 1624. It bears the caption, "The Records of the Company of Virginia, Vol. 2d." Pages 492 to 502 include a list of "The names of the Adventurers for Virginia, as they were in the Year 1620." On the inside of the board of this volume is written the name, "Sam'l Perkins of Cawson." There is a third volume of this series of transcripts which is described by Mr. Robinson thus: "The other volume begins with the first charter to the proprietors of Carolina dated the 24th of March, in the fifteenth year of Charles II, (1663) and ends page 543 with report of the petition of Philip Laudwell against the Lord Effingham made by the Lords Committees of Trade and Plantations, Dated at the Council Chamber 26th of April 1689." This document ends on page 530. The volume closes on page 544 with "A Memorial for obtaining a more perfect Rent Roll, &amp; advancing Her Majesty's Quit Rents in Virginia". On the first cover is the date, "Sep 19th 1759." Mr. Brown thinks that these copies were made for Colonel Richard Bland from Colonel Byrd's volumes and passed to Theodorick Bland of the family of Cawson, the grandfather of John Randolph of Roanoke, to whom they finally came. He adds that the Byrd volumes went to Mr. Jefferson with the Bland collection, which he bought about 1776, instead of the copies therefrom.a a See an account of "Two manuscript volumes now in the Library of Congress, at Washington, D.C.," in The Magazine of American History, New York, Vol. 29, April, 1893. Mr. Jameson suggests that John Randolph of Roanoke may have inherited these transcripts from his great uncle, Sir John Randolph. In this case also they would have been made from Mr. Byrd's volumes, and perhaps should have gone to Mr. Jefferson with the Peyton Randolph library, but this would not account for the name "Cawson" in the second volume. Furthermore, according to Mr. Stanard, John Randolph of Roanoke was not an heir to Sir John Randolph, and the families were not even on friendly terms. Mr. Brown's supposition seems the more plausible, since Theodorick Bland, jr., of Cawson may have received the volumes from the son of Richard Bland by gift or purchase, though not by inheritance, and, as Theo- dorick Bland, jr., died without heirs in 1790, the books may have become the property of his sister's son, John Randolph of Roanoke. The location of these volumes since the time of the death of John Randolph of Roanoke is known. According to Mr. Brown, John Randolphb b Not to be confused with Sir John Randolph, father of the Peyton Randolph whose library Jefferson says he purchased in 1778. in a codicil to his will in 1826 left his library to the master and fellows of Trinity College, Cambridge, but in 1831 so altered the will as to bequeath it to his niece, E. T. Bryan. Certain it is, however, that for ten years after his death on May 4, 1833, the volumes remained in his library in Roanoke, for Hon. Hugh Blair Grigsby examined them at that place on January 11, 1843. The library was sold in 1845, but it is evident from the statement of Judge William Leigh, the executor of the estate, that the Randolph copy of the court book remained in his hands. The later history of this copy is told by Mr. Leigh Robinson, of Washington, D.C., as follows: "A complete transcript of the Records of the Virginia Company had been in the possession of John Randolph of Roanoke, and by Mr. Randolph's executor, Judge William Leigh, was placed in the hands of my father, shortly after the termination of the war between the States. The Virginia Historical Society, having then no shelter of safety for such a work, my father placed it in the Vaults of one of the banks of Richmond, with a view to transferring it to the Society, as soon as it could be done with Safety. His death occurred before (in his opinion) this could be done. After his death, his family transferred to the Society the copy made by him- self. It was some time before they were able to discover the place of deposit of the Randolph Copy. But they finally recovered it, and transferred this also to the Vir- ginia Historical Society, where it now is."a a See a manuscript letter to Mr. Worthington C. Ford, Chief of the Division of Manuscripts in the Library of Congress, December 15, 1902. These volumes, and the third described by Mr. Robinson's father are now in the Virginia Historical Society collection in Richmond. Mr. Conway Robinson, the father of Mr. Leigh Robinson, prepared for the press two volumes of abstracts from the court book, which were edited later by R. A. Brock for the Virginia Historical Society and entitled Virginia Company, 1619–1624. Robinson states that in the preparation of the volumes he had many transcripts made through Mr. Mehan from the copy in the Library of Congress, and also from the Randolph volumes which Judge Leigh had loaned to him.b b A letter of Mr. Robinson to Mr. Deane, July 1, 1868. For the use of this letter, as also one from Mr. Deane to Mr. Robinson of July 6, 1868, the Editor is indebted to Mr. J. Franklin Jameson, professor of history in Chicago University. In a memorandum Mr. Deane states that he inspected these volumes in April, 1872, at which time they were at the house of Mr. S. A. Myers, the law partner of Mr. Con- way Robinson. The third volume of this Randolph series, which is cited both by Burk and by Heningc c For the extracts from the "Ancient Records," Vol. III, so called, by Hening, see Statutes at Large, I, 76–113 (collated readings given), 113–120, 145, 146, 209, 223. as "Ancient Records, Volume III," was copied from the transcript attested by R. Hickman. This volume of Miscellaneous Records, 1606–1692, is the only volume which contains the substance found in the Randolph copy, and is of an earlier date, and, like the original rolls, is less chronological in arrangement. That the Randolph copy was not made from the original records is evidenced by the fact that the abstracts are identical with those of the Hickman or "Bland" copy. That both Hening and Burk used the Randolph copies of the court book and also the third volume of that series is proved by their descriptions of the volumes, while the page references to "Ancient Records" cited by Hening coincide in each case with these three volumes. Mr. Hening speaks of three large folio volumes not in the orthography of the age of the events, and compiled without much regard to method for the purpose of forming material for a history of Virginia, and states that the first two volumes are minutes of the proceedings of the London Company, and the third an epitome of the legislative and judicial acts of authorities in Vir- ginia, so far as then extant, which were regularly transmitted to England. These, he continues, were used by John Burk, who got them from John Randolph, and also by Skelton Jones, 1809, to complete Burk's History of Virginia.a a Hening, Statutes at Large, I, 76 n. (a). Mr. Burk himself declares that there are two large volumes, instead of three, as stated by Hening, "containing the minutes of the London Company together with the pro- ceedings of the Virginia Councils and Assembly, with little interruption to the middle of the reign of George II."b b Burk, History of Virginia, I, ch. V; II. 7. 42. 67. JEFFERSON TRANSCRIPTS The three volumes containing transcripts of the Virginia Records which came from the Jefferson Library in 1815 are unique, containing copies of records since destroyed. Two of them are attested by R. Hickman, the deputy clerk of the general court in 1722, and the third is the only seventeenth century transcript in our possession. Unlike the Randolph copies, the two large volumes include copies of records since destroyed. Of this group the "First laws made by the assembly in Va. Anno 1623" bears on the back of the last page the following indorsement in Mr. Jefferson's hand: "This was found among the manuscript papers of Sr John Randolph and by the Hoñble. Peyton Randolph, esq. his son was given to Tho. Jefferson," and is attested as follows: "Copia Test R. Hickman D C G C." This early eighteenth century transcript was made by the same copyist as were the Miscellaneous Records, 1606–1692, and is the volume used by Hening and referred to in his first volume, pages 121–129. It must also be the subject of a letter from Thomas Jefferson to Hening, April 8, 1815, in which he states that the manuscript marked "A" contains laws of 1623–24, thirty-five acts, which was given him by Peyton Randolph from the materials used by Sir John Randolph, and which Mr. Jefferson declares to be the "Only copy extant of those laws!"a a Jefferson Letters, in the Library of Congress. This is an error, since a contemporary copy has been found among the "fragile papers" in Jefferson's own possession at the time. In 1803 Mr. Jefferson had declined to lend to Mr. John D. Burk some of the printed laws of Virginia in his possession, since they were unique and could not be replaced.b b Thomas Jefferson to John D. Burk, Monticello, February 21, 1803. The internal evidence points to the fact that Hening also used the other volumes of this set, a fact corroborated by the following statement of Mr. Jefferson in a letter to Mr. George Watterson, May 7, 1815: "I gave to Mr. Milligan a note of those folio volumes of the Laws of Virginia belonging to the Library which being in known hands, will be recovered. One is a MS. volume from which a printed copy is now preparing for publica- tion."c c W. D. Johnston, History of the Library of Congress, I, 178. Mr. Hening was doubtless using them in the preparation of his later volumes. Certain it is that these documents form the basis for a part of his first volume, in which he cites the Journal of the Council and Assembly, 1626–1634, as belonging to Thomas Jefferson, and as having been "purchased by him with the library of Peyton Randolph, from his executors." The third, the Miscellaneous Records, 1606–1692, he states was bought by Mr. Jefferson "from the executor of Richard Bland, dec'd."d d Hening, Statutes at Large, I, 147, 152, 224. The first four volumes of this work were published in 1809. By an act of the assembly in 1819 the work was completed. In 1823 the first four volumes were reprinted. The seventeenth century volume, entitled Instructions, Commi?ons letters of Advice and admonitions and Publique Speeches, Proclamations &amp;c: Collected, transcribed and diligently examined by the Originall Records, now extant, belonging to the Assemblie, is a vellum-covered book, with an embossed figure on the back cover, and with the following: "E / 1621 / Publi? Letters / and Orders." On the outside of the front cover upside down is: "E / John Bland / Richard Blan [d]/ Alexander Morrison," / while on the half that remains of the first fly leaf is the name "Nelson." On the fly leaf in the book in pencil is the statement: "date of MSS 1650–1695;" and on the front cover similarly is: "17" Century copie Bland." This presence of Richard Bland's name in the book shows that Mr. Jefferson secured it with the Bland Library. The writing of the volume is similar to the early seven- teenth century system in many of the abbreviations, the use of the double f, and the formation of some of the letters. Evidently this is a collection of correspondence of the colony, transcribed from the court books and from the miscellaneous papers of the three volumes of the manuscript records of the company.e e For the contents of this volume as late as 1624 see the List of Records. The second volume of documents from 1606 to 1692 is in an eighteenth century hand, many of the documents bearing the attestation of R. Hickman. The binding is in calf and bears on the back the red label, "Vir/. Records." Bound into the back of this volume is a small quarto of twenty-five pages, containing outlines of documents in the Manuscript Records of the Company, which serves to identify the loose pages of the original records as Roll A. 42, and an abstract of Captain Argall's register during his government.a a The documents there referred to by page are noted in the "List of Records." The original register of Captain Argall has not been found. The documents in the folio volume are charters, instructions, commissions, letters from the Privy Council, and other documents emanating from the Crown, together with one or two from the company and from the council in Virginia.b b For the contents of this volume see the List of Records. That this volume is the one used by Hening in his Statutes and referred to as the "Bland copy,"c c Hening, Statutes, I, 223, 224–238. is indicated by the contents as well as by the fact that it includes the quarto volume. His reason for citing it as the "Bland copy" can only be surmised, namely, that he had Mr. Jefferson's statement that it had been secured with the Bland library, an erroneous designation as is proved by Stith's statement in his preface, that R. Hickman made a copy of the Records for Sir John Randolph.d d Stith, History of Virginia, Preface, which is dated December 10, 1746. But the volume has been known for the past century as the "Bland copy," although its title as a "Hickman" or a "Randolph" volume would be more appropriate. The conclusions which have been formed with regard to these original and contemporary manuscripts and the later transcripts disclose little concerning the circumstances under which they were made, or the original owners of the volumes. But the important facts to discover, in order to determine their authenticity, are the period of the transcript and the documents from which the copies were made, and these facts in each case have been ascertained.e e For published statements and discussions of the history and identity of the volumes in the Library of Congress which concern the Virginia Company, as also of the Randolph copy, see: Robert C.

The Library of Congress has recently acquired a large number of transcripts of those manuscripts now in the libraries of Great Britain pertaining to the Virginia Company or to the colony under the authority of the company. It thus possesses reproductions of all of the Virginia material in the British Museum, the Privy Council office, the Bodleian Library, and the Magdalene College Library, Cambridge. In the Public Record Office all docquet notices on Virginia, all records of suits in chancery and the admiralty pertaining to Virginia, and the quo warranto in the King's Bench, by which the company was dissolved, as well as the most important documents and correspondence, have been transcribed or photographed for the Library of Congress, but the correspondence of the planters, the less important correspondence of the company, and mere memoranda are yet to be transcribed. The latter material is fairly outlined in the Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series, 1574 to 1660, and in the Appendix of the eighth report of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts, or is printed elsewhere in full.a a All of these papers are included in the List of Records. The collection of publications by the company belonging to the Library of Congress is fairly good. It contains twelve of those which were issued before 1616, but of the later books it has only three. The Declaration of 1620, the Declaration by Waterhouse in 1622, and John Donne's Sermon of the same year, in addition to Smith's General History, are the only ones of the eighteen now extant which are in the Library. DOCUMENTS IN RICHMOND The colonial records in Richmond, Virginia, relating to the period of the company are extremely few in number. Fortunately the original documents, which are in the Library of Congress, were borrowed or abstracted from the state house in time to save them from destruction during the Revolution or by fire in 1865.b b William G. Stanard, "The Virginia Archives" in the Report of the American Historical Associa- tion, 1903, I, 645–664. There are, however, two volumes of original records in the Virginia State land office containing grants of land in 1623 and 1624, which were evidently entered by William Claybourne, at that time surveyor for the colony. The his- tory of contemporary documents before 1625, which are located in the district of the old settlement, may thus be briefly told. The valuable collections of the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond embrace the John Randolph of Roanoke transcripts described above, while the State library has three sets of transcripts and one set of abstracts from the British Public Record Office. Of the latter the De Jarnette papers, 1606–1691, include only a few of the documents of interest; in the Macdonald and Winder papers are full and careful copies of several of the long and important documents, following generally the orthography of the originals; while the Sainsbury abstracts contain comparatively full outlines of those documents included in the Calendar of State Papers, Colonial Series. MANUSCRIPTS IN THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY The New York Public Library is next in importance to the Library of Congress in manuscript material on the Virginia Company and second only to the John Carter Brown Library of Providence, Rhode Island, in publications. In the Lenox branch of the New York Library is to be found a unique set of documents relating to the settlement of Berkeley Hundred in 1619, known as the Smyth of Nibley papers which "are from the collection of Virginia manuscripts originally brought together by John Smyth (or Smith) of Nibley, the historian of the Berkeleys, who was born in 1567 and died in 1641. The collection comprises over sixty papers, original and contemporary transcripts, relating to the settlement of Virginia between 1613 and 1634. After passing into the hands of John Smyth the younger, and more recently into the Cholmondeley collection at Condover Hall, Shropshire, the manuscripts were offered for sale in January, 1888, by Mr. Bernard Quaritch, from whom they were lately bought and given to the New York Public Library by Mr. Alex- ander Maitland."a a Quoted from the New York Public Library Bulletin (1897), I, 68, and (1899), III, 160. With the exception of the manuscripts in the Ferrar collection relating to Smythe's Hundred, these form the only extant records of the important movement for private plantations in Virginia under the régime of the company. Two other valuable documents are now in the possession of the Lenox Library,b b List of Records, Nos. 133 and 640. the holographic letter of John Pory, secretary of the colony, dated September 30, 1619, and Commissioner John Harvey's declaration of the State of Virginia in 1624. COLLECTIONS OF AMERICANA The manuscripts in the Library of Congress, the Smyth of Nibley papers in the New York Public Library, and the patent books in Virginia are the only original records of the company or of the colony previous to 1625 now in America. But there are two public collections of Americana which are extremely valuable for this period: The John Carter Brown Library in Providence, Rhode Island, which contains only books on America published before the year 1800, and the New York Public Library. In the John Carter Brown Library are two royal proclamations, which are the only documents of the character for the period in America; while a declaration of a division of land in 1616, which is a supplementary pamphlet in the Declaration by the Company of June 22, 1620, has no duplicate in existence, although there is an imperfect copy of the latter in the British Museum. The copy of the 1620 declara- tion in the Lenox Library is also unique, since it contains a different supplementary pamphlet of which there is but one other to be found, neither of which has hereto- fore been noted.a a The other copy is in a private collection in New York. This library has also the first editions of the declaration of 1620; the treatise by Banoeil, reprinted in 1622, containing the letters of the King and of the council; Patrick Copland's Virginia's God be Thanked, and his Declaration how the monies were disposed, published in 1622; Edward Waterhouse's Declaration of the State of the Colony, 1622; John Donne's Sermon, 1622. It is a declaration of November 15, 1620, concerning the dispatch of supplies, and proves by its date that this is a later edition of the declaration of June 22. The John Carter Brown Library also contains a unique treatise by John Brinsley, bearing the date 1622, the only other copy of which is in the Lenox Library. It has also two sermons, one by Patrick Copland, entitled Virginia's God be Thanked,b b There is a manuscript copy of this sermon in the Library of Congress. with duplicates in the possession of Edward E. Ayer, and of the Pequot Library, Southport, Connecticut, and one by John Donne, of which there are copies in the Lenox, the Ayer, and the Congressional libraries. In addition to these rare books, the Declaration of Edward Waterhouse of 1622, containing "The Inconveniences that have happened, 1622," and Observations to be followed for making of fit roomes for silk worms, 1620, including "A valuation of the commodi- ties growing and to be had in Virginia; rated as they are worth," are to be found in the Providence collection, while the latter is also in the Harvard and the Lenox libraries.c c "The Inconveniences" was published separately as a broadside, and copies are to be found in the Lenox Library and in the collections of the Society of Antiquaries, London. A copy was in the Cholmondeley collection, which is probably the one mentioned in the Quaritch catalogue of May, 1887. This, as also a copy of the Observations, was sold to Mr. Kalbfleisch. The supposition that it was originally published as a part of the Declaration of Edward Waterhouse does not seem valid, since the John Carter Brown copy is the only one containing the broadside, and the page in that case has evidently been trimmed and inserted. In the same year a Treatise on the art of making silk was published by John Banoeil, containing a royal letter of encouragement to the Earl of Southampton, now to be found both in the Brown and the Lenox libraries. The New York Public Library is second only in value to the John Carter Brown Library for this subject. In addition to the books noted above it contains two unique publications of the company, the first is a broadside of May 17, 1620, which is the only copy known to the Editor. A catalogue of Bernard Quaritch, in May, 1887, describes such a broadside, which is known to have been purchased by Mr. Kalbfleisch. The second is A Note of the Shipping, etc., sent to Virginia in 1621. The Cholmondeley copy of this also was sold by Mr. Quaritch to Mr. Kalbfleisch.a a In the catalogue of Bernard Quaritch for May, 1887, the broadside of May 17, 1620, and the Note of the Shipping, 1621, are both noted as being unique since each contains the final clause: "Who- soever transports himself or any other at his own charge unto Virginia, shall for each person so trans- ported before mid-summer, 1625, have to him and his heirs forever 50 acres of land upon a first and 50 acres upon a second division." A copy of the Note of the Shipping, 1621, in the Cholmondeley collection is similarly described in the fifth report of the Historical Manuscripts Commission, page 341. The Quaritch copies were sold to Mr. Kalbfleisch, whose collection went to Mr. Lefferts, and finally through the dealers, Geo. H. Richmond or Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., either to a private collection or to the Lenox Library. But the Lenox copies either do not correspond to these descriptions or were not purchased from Mr. Lefferts. The volumes of the Lefferts collection, which were not sold in America, were sent to Sotheby, England, but Mr. Eames of the New York Public Library states that no early Virginia material was allowed to return to England. A third copy of the same is in the collection of printed broadsides of the Society of Antiquaries in London. The volumes of printed material relating to the Virginia Company, which are in the Harvard Library, have been mentioned above. Two private collections deserve mention for their comparatively large number of important publications of the company, the private collection in New York and that of Mr. Edward Ayer, in Chicago, Illinois.b b The collection of Americana belonging to Mr. Ayer is open to the public through the Newberry Library. For the early Virginia material of the library see Index under "Ayer, Edward." In addition to twenty other rare publications of the company Mr. Ayer has a unique book entitled "Greevovs Grones for the Poore," 1621. It refers to the Virginia Company in its address only, and in the statement of the number of poor that had been sent to Virginia, but is of value for an understanding of that movement. The other private collection is of about the same size. It contains the duplicate of the 1620 declaration in the Lenox and the only known copy of a four-page tract entitled "Declaration how the monies were disposed (being) collections for the Grammar Schooles," by Patrick Copland.c c This tract is described in the Appendix of the Fifth Report of the Historical Manuscripts Commission, as follows: "A Declaration how the monies, viz., 70, 8s. 6d., were disposed, which was gathered (by Mr. Patrick Copland, preacher in the Royal James) at the Cape of Good Hope (toward the building of a free schoole in Virginia) of the gentlemen and mariners in the said ship; a list of whose names are under specified, &amp;c. 4to 7 pp. Imprinted at London by F. K. 1622." TRANSCRIPTS IN THE NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY Other attempts have been made to secure resources for research in America. Not only is there the aggregation of excerpts from the English documents in Richmond, as described above, and the acquisition of transcripts in the Library of Congress within recent years, but half a century ago a similar interest was displayed by collectors and historians in New York City, forming three collec- tions which are to-day in the Lenox Library. William H. Aspinwall, a merchant, secured among other papers the Chalmers collection of letters and documents relating to Virginia from 1606 to 1775. They were in turn sold to Samuel Latham Mitchell Barlow, a lawyer and notable collector of New York City, from whom a part were purchased by the library, while others came to the Lenox with the Bancroft transcripts in 1893. Chalmers had been a clerk in the State paper office and seems to have taken these extracts, outlines, and sometimes full copies from the Plantation office papers, since he continually refers to them in his Political Annals.a a See a statement by Victor H. Paltsits, April 14, 1896, inserted in the first volume of these papers now in the Lenox. They are modern- ized transcripts, failing to follow the early orthography, abbreviations, and capitalization. The writing is cramped and often almost illegible, while the table of contents is incomplete and useless. They comprise (1) a series of brief outlines of Privy Council orders; (2) extracts from the Dudley-Carleton papers; (3) outlines of additional Council orders; (4) a calendar of certain of the colonial State papers; (5) outlines of council orders dealing with other trading companies. All of the original documents are at present in the Public Record Office and are noted in the Bibliographical List of Records following. The Bancroft papers relating to Virginia and the Simancas Archives are well bound, clear, and apparently careful, correct, and full copies of the documents included. The first two volumes of the Bancroft collection bearing on the Virginia Company are transcripts of many of the documents in the State paper office, probably made in 1852 by Noel Sainsbury, but the list is not complete. While the peculiar and characteristic signs of abbreviation are not followed, the orthog- raphy seems to be accurate throughout. Furthermore, the collection includes the document entire, unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents is careful and correct.b b The documents transcribed in both the Chalmers-Barlow and the Bancroft volumes are noted in the List of Records under "Remarks." The "Simancas Archives" is a volume of transcripts of "Papers in the Simancas Archives relating to the History of Virginia and other portions of America between 1608 and 1624, made for Alexander Brown and many of them used by him in his book, The Genesis of the U. S." The only document relating to Virginia which is not reproduced in that collection is a repetition of the proclamation of the King of England concerning tobacco, bearing the date November 12, 1624. COLLECTIONS IN ENGLAND FERRAR PAPERS The most unique collection in England for the study of the Virginia Company is that in the possession of Magdelene College, Cambridge. As the property of Nicholas and John Ferrar, who were second only to Sir Edwin Sandys in their activity in the company, it would be invaluable; but its importance is further enhanced by the fact that it contains the correspondence and papers of Sir Edwin Sandys himself. These seventy-eight papers, which are either records of the company or vitally concern it, cover the period of the Sandys-Southampton influence from 1617 to the summer of 1623. They were the property of Dr. Peckard, master of Magdalene College in 1790, and were bequeathed to the college upon his death. It is probable that the greater part of the collection came from the Ferrar family through Dr. Peckard's wife, Martha Ferrar, the great granddaugher of John Ferrar, since the Virginia papers form but one-third of the group. The remain- ing papers concern family affairs only, and date from 1601 to the middle of the eighteenth century. Some of them are doubtless those received from the Earl of Dorset by Dr. Peckard, when he was preparing his Memoirs of Nicholas Ferrar.a a In this work Dr. Peckard states that the Earl of Dorset had had his library searched and had sent him a few loose papers belonging to the Virginia Company. The first knowledge of the Ferrar papers in later years was communicated to the Virginia Magazine of History by Michael Lloyd Ferrar, Little Gidding. Ealing, England. He sent a number of transcripts and photographs of letters to the maga- zine for publication, among which were some half dozen bearing on the affairs of the company, but the number which he was permitted to reproduce was limited by the college. While Mr. Ferrar was completing a history of the Ferrar family the entire collection was deposited at his home, and it was therefore in Ealing in the fall of 1903 that the Editor was first permitted by the authorities of the college to "see and note the contents" of the papers. Before the following summer Mr. Ferrar had died and the collection had been returned to Cambridge, where complete trans- cripts of all letters and photographs of all documents relating to the Virginia Company were made for the Library of Congress under the supervision of the Editor. These papers are loose, many of them being much damaged, and it is apparent that they are a part of a larger collection which must have been neglected while in the possession of the family. There are some envelopes without letters, many rough memoranda by both Nicholas and John Ferrar, some account books, and some rough drafts of petitions to the House of Commons and of discussions on the silkworm. The autographs which they furnish of both Nicholas and John Ferrar have been of no little interest, as well as value, for the identification of other papers in the Public Record Office, and in the Library of Congress. Furthermore, the proof that Nicholas Ferrar himself supervised the transcript of the court book is thus gained. In this collection are twenty-three papers which are veritable records of the company.a a List of Records, Nos. 76, 138, 164, 258, 259, 303, 304, 394, 421, 423, 470, 479, 539, 541, 543, and the quo warranto. Two documents give our only knowledge of the financial affairs of Smythe's Hundred, slight indeed, but from them comes additional information concerning the system of organization of the societies for private adventure. Sundry other unique though scattered documents are among these papers, such as receipts for money expended, showing the method of business, reports of committees, and of proceedings of the commissioners, revealing the bitterness of the factions, drafts or original records of certain courts, forming the only proof of the accuracy of the copies of the court books, and three new proceedings of the courts of the Somers Islands Company. One of the latter is evidently a blotter and reveals the methods used in keeping the court book. The quo warranto in English, which was served upon the treasurer and company, would have been of the greatest value had not the original record of the suit in the King's Bench just been discovered. Another document of great value is the receipt referred to above, which proves that a court book was regularly kept by the company from its very beginning. It reveals how much has been lost. The series, consisting of twenty letters from Sir Edwin Sandys to John Ferrar, shows more clearly than any other documents we possessb b For these letters see Ibid., Nos. 120, 131, 135, 136, 171, 181, 191, 197, 211, 219, 271, 275, 282, 307, 315, 316, 317, 364, 368. who the real managers of the affairs were and what was the spirit of the Sandys faction. The absolute confidence which Sir Edwin Sandys had in John Ferrar and his great love for both of the brothers is significant. Moreover, the knowledge of the affairs of the company, the careful watch over every act and movement affecting the business, the deep and earnest plans for the advancement of its interests revealed in these letters prove that Sir Edwin Sandys was the keen financial manager of the undertaking. It was evidently he who determined what the policy should be; he was apparently the statesman and the politician, directing the method of address to the lords of the council or the attitude to be assumed toward the Crown, controlling the courts so that he might be present when there was danger of faction, concealing the information received from the colony when he feared it would entail criticism. Much of the personal feeling and animosity that existed is here shown, and much also which reveals actual financial conditions. The last group of these papers comprises thirty-five letters, all but one or two of which were written by planters or adventurers, resident in the colony, to Sir Edwin Sandys.a a For these letters, see List of Records, Nos. 93, 94, 115, 119, 134, 153, 156, 158, 166, 173, 179, 180, 235, 238, 239, 241, 243–250, 252–255, 285, 343, 466. Of these, five came from Governor Yeardley, ten from either John Pory or George Thorpe, secretaries in the colony at different times, and two from the cape merchant; of the remainder, at least ten are from colonists whose opinions and reports have not reached us in any other way. These letters are as full of complaint with regard to the insufficient supplies sent with new planters, as are the letters in the Manchester papers which Sir Nathaniel Rich and the Earl of Warwick used as a basis of accusation against the management of the company, but they differ from the other complaints in that they are kindly in spirit. Mr. Pory's letters are full of definite information concerning the affairs, needs, and hopes of the colony, while Governor Yeardley also gives some valuable statements with regard to new settlers, the council, the relations with the Indians, and the government of the colony; both complain of the scant provisioning of the new settlers. The burden of the Yeardley letters, however, is the investigation of the affairs of Captain Argall and the consequent criticism drawn upon himself from Lord Rich. Unfortunately, comparatively few additional data are afforded concerning the Argall affair either by Pory or by Yeardley. The planters themselves tell much of their condition and of the districts in which they have settled, but the theme of their letters is most likely to be a demand for promised payments or a complaint as to the scarcity of provisions and clothes. The attitude toward Yeardley is generally favorable, John Rolfe alone supporting Argall and criticizing the governor. As from all correspondence of such a character, new ideas are gained, new points of view, and often additional knowledge of relations with the Indians and with one another. Many of these letters are annotated by John Ferrar, revealing the degree of importance which he attached to their various and often conflicting statements. PUBLIC RECORD OFFICE—MANCHESTER PAPERS A class of documents, very similar in character but of quite different spirit is the Manchester papers, now in the Public Record Office, London. Robert, Earl of Warwick, and his cousin, Sir Nathaniel Rich, were both members of the company. Sir Nathaniel was a leader in the Warwick faction, while Earl Robert, after the dissolution of the company in 1624, became a member of the council for Virginia. The third wife of the Earl was Eleanor, Countess of Sussex, daughter of Richard Wortley, and she, after the death of the Earl of Warwick, married, as her fourth husband, Edward Montague, second Earl of Manchester. Thus it is that the Kimbolton manuscripts, which are the records of the Duke of Manchester, contain a large collection of petitions, declarations, memoranda, letters, and lists which emanated from the Warwick faction of the Virginia Company.a a These Manchester papers are calendared by the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts, Report VIII, Part 2. Many of these are holographs of Nathaniel Rich and Alderman Johnson, prime movers in that conflict. Henry Montague, Viscount Mandeville and later Earl of Manchester, was at one time lord president of the Privy Council. Therefore many of the Manchester papers may have belonged to him. The autographs, however, identify those which concern the Virginia Company as having belonged to Nathaniel Rich. The Manchester and the Ferrar papers therefore present the two sides of this conflict, not in open court or even in private contest, but in the private documents and memoranda of the leaders. The collections are of about the same size, there being sixty-six papers in the Manchester series, to seventy-eight in the Ferrar group. These, also, are unbound, but since the greater part are rough notes of documents, or drafts of propositions or speeches, they are much more difficult to decipher than the Ferrar papers. Indeed many of them are almost illegible, and not a few are unintelligible, having no connecting thought. A dozen of these papers may be considered documentary; that is, rough copies of letters, petitions, and declarations, or of acts of the company, or of its members and officers in an official capacity. A few of these only are to be found among the other records of the company. Like the rest of the set, they, almost without exception, concern the accusations against the Sandys-Southampton management. Three of them are petitions or letters concerning the extent of the tobacco trade, but the rest are petitions to the King against one faction or the other, and answers to those petitions. Of these, one of the most important is a copy of the opinion of counsel concerning the powers conferred on the Virginia Company by the several letters patent.b b List of Records, p. 140, No. 170. Accusation and defense are set forth in these documents, but the headings of speeches, the drafts of propositions, and the notes from docu- ments on which the arguments are based proclaim the motives and methods of the accusers. No proof could be clearer than these memoranda by Alderman Johnson and Nathaniel Rich that the company was to be overthrown by fair means or foul. In two or three papers are carefully prepared lists of alleged evil deeds of Sir Edwin Sandys and catalogues of the faults and errors of the company, while the criticisms of the policy and of the management of the company are set down in order, based on letters from colonists, of which there are eleven in the collection. In these criticisms and drafts of propositions much information is afforded concerning the management, organization, and condition of the colony and com- pany. Thus, various books kept by the company during Sir Thomas Smythe's time, and not otherwise known, are mentioned.a a List of Records, No. 438. Five or six rough drafts of propositions concerning the tobacco and salary question are also to be found here, as well as numerous statements of sums adventured, of the number of men sent to the colony, lists of members favorable to one faction or the other and candidates for office from both parties. Many of the rough notes of both Johnson and Rich furnish the only source of information concerning the directions given to the commissioners appointed by the Crown to investigate the condition of the company and of the colony and their acts and reports, but a fact of greater sig- nificance is this, that the Warwick collection contains a dozen rough drafts of directions to those commissioners, of charges against the company to be sent to that body, of preliminary reports concerning the government of Virginia, and of projects for the settlement of the government and the colony. The source of the schism is here revealed, and the accusation by Sandys that accuser and judge were one is justified.b b A letter from Sir Edwin Sandys to John Ferrar, cited in the List of Records, No. 317. COLONIAL AND DOMESTIC STATE PAPERS The other large group of Virginia records, consisting of over one hundred and twenty separate documents, is found among the colonial and domestic papers deposited in the Public Record Office. The source of this collection is uncertain. Much of it came from the Plantation Office, and perhaps from the Privy Council Office. The consolidation of depositories took place in 1578, but the efforts of Dr. Thomas Wilson, the first clerk of the papers, to force the previous and incumbent magistrates to hand over all documents to the State, were evidently often unavailing, and hence it was that the creation of a State Paper Office was not really accomplished until the period of the company. After Sir Thomas Wilson succeeded his uncle during the reign of James I the aid of the King was much relied upon, and, though partially successful, the recent revelation of quasi- public documents in private collections shows that not only earlier but later officials considered papers of record private property.c c Scargill-Bird, A Guide to the Documents in the Public Record Office, Introduction, p. xxxvi. See also W. N. Sainsbury, "Calendar of Documents relating to the History of the State Paper Office to the year 1800," in the Deputy Keepers Report, No. 30, Appendix, No. 7, pp. 212–293. Thus some of the Salis- bury papers, which Wilson failed to secure, are now at Hatfield House; and others have passed with the Lansdowne collection into the British Museum, where they are known as the Burghley papers. Similarly, the Cottonian papers in the Museum originally belonged to Sir Robert Cotton in the time of James I. Among the State Papers deposited in the Record Office are the letters to John Ferrar, dated from Virginia in April, 1623, which may have been seized by the commission appointed on May 9, 1623, to investigate the affairs of the com- pany. There, too, are found the attested copies of letters and records in the colony which concern the Harvey Commission, sent to the commission in England by Edward Sharpless. A few of these papers seem to have belonged to the company, such as the documents pertaining to the Walloons and dated 1621; Pory's report from Virginia, in the same year; and two copies of documents by Collingwood, dated the latter part of 1623.a a List of Records, pp. 145, ff., Nos. 227, 243, 444, 520, 579. All of these facts lead to the con- clusion that a part of the records of the commissions, and a part of the confis- cated records of the company are here deposited. If so, where are the remainder of these most valuable documents?b b For a discussion of the fate of the missing records and the probability as to their existence, see ch. V, post. The colonial papers and the domestic correspondence include about forty-eight which are records, and about nineteen which are documentary in character. The first group contains, among other papers, many of the petitions and letters addressed to the King and to the Privy Council, and many others of the council. It is thus apparent that the royal correspondence of the Privy Council and the Privy Council papers which should accompany the register are in this collection. To the second group belong those papers which contain projects presented by individuals and answers to such propositions, lists of adventures for the company, and also lists of men sent to the colony and of lands granted in Virginia. Among these papers are seven letters from colonists, in addition to about fifty which may be consid- ered subsidiary correspondence in that they refer incidentally to the affairs of the company. Such are the Mandeville-Conway, Middlesex-Conway, Chamberlain- Carleton, Conway-Calvert, and Nethersole-Carleton letters. RECORDS OF COURTS In the libels of the admiralty court, instance and prize, are found records of suits in which the Virginia Company is plaintiff. As a part of the controversy in which William Wye appears as defendant is the suit of Yonge vs. Roberts; while the fragment of the record of the Earl of Warwick vs. Edward Bruister concerning the trouble over the ships Neptune and Treasurer completes the list of cases in that court which in any way affect the Virginia Company. The latter is so torn and defaced that but for an occasional date or fact, it affords no information of value. Among the other formal material of the suit against Wye are two valuable documents, namely, the commission given to Wye and a letter from the treasurer and council to Sir George Yeardley, dated June 21, 1619. In the latter are valuable references to Argall, and the complaints against Wye, though torn and illegible, reveal something of the loss estimated as resulting from the failure to settle the passengers in Virginia. These records of the admiralty court have not hereto- fore been published, although they were cited by R. G. Marsden in his discussion of those documents.a a R. G. Marsden, "Records of the Admiralty Court" in the Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, new series, Vol. XVI, 90–96. Many parts of these records are undecipherable, and as a result the transcripts made for the Library of Congress are incomplete. But the chancery files, which have furnished the records of suits by the Virginia Company, have only just been indexed, and hence the documents have not heretofore been known. The record of the quo warranto suit by which the Virginia Company was over- thrown has been erroneously declared to be not extant, a mistake due to a differ- ence in view with regard to the court out of which such a writ would be issued and as to the court in which the writ would be returnable. Hence the search for the document has hitherto been conducted in the Petty Bag of the Chancery instead of in the coram rege roll of the King's Bench. It was in the latter roll that the full record of the writ, the pleadings, and the judgment were discovered by the Editor in the fall of 1903.b b For a discussion of the content of the document, see post, p. 103. In A Guide to the Documents in the Public Record Office Mr. Bird gives the following explanation of the placita de quo warranto: They "consist of the pleadings and judgments on writs of 'quo warranto' in nature of writs of right on behalf of the King against those who claimed or usurped any office, franchise, or liberty. The pleadings and judgments on writs of 'quo war- ranto' or of 'quo titulo clamat' took place in the King's Bench or the Exchequer and are enrolled on the 'coram rege rolls' or the 'memoranda rolls' accordingly."c c P. 166. The statement in the court book of the company is that the "company had been served with process out of the King's Bench by virtue of a quo warranto." It was this clue and that from Mr. Scargill-Bird that led the Editor to conduct the search successfully in the coram rege roll. In the Record Office are also the docquet books, which afford some knowledge of the grants of the King affecting the customs on tobacco, and the patent rolls, which contain the letters patent of 1606, 1609, and 1612. In the colonial entry books and among the proclamations of the King are orders of the Privy Council and of the King, all of which are recorded in the Privy Council register. PRIVY COUNCIL REGISTER Since the Privy Council took no direct part in the affairs of the company between 1617 and the summer of 1622, its orders related to those regulations which would enable the acts of the company to advance the interests of the kingdom, leaving absolute power to the company as the proprietor. Thus fully one-half of its thirty measures during those five years were reprieves of prisoners, with the warrants nec- essary to send them to Virginia or orders enabling children to be transferred from the cities of the kingdom to the colony. During this period the Crown commenced its attempts to secure a revenue from the tobacco trade, and a series of orders finally resulted in the approval of the contract with the company in February of 1622/3. In its foreign and external relations the company was of course subject to the action of the Privy Council, and hence the orders in council concerned the contest with Spain over the attack of the Treasurer. Furthermore, the disagreement with the northern colony concerning fishing privileges had to be adjusted by the council and resulted in the renewal of the patent to the northern colony and in regulations as to rights of fishing. It was in the summer of 1622 that the first movement was made which brought the difficulties between the factions into the open board. The petition of John Bargrave against Sir Thomas Smythe, Alderman Johnson, and others, in which they were accused of mismanagement, resulted in the defeat of Bargrave six months later, as was to have been expected from the hostility of the Crown to the party in Parliament led by Sir Edwin Sandys, of which Bargrave was evidently a member at that time. But the storm broke in the following April, when the commission was appointed to inquire into the true state of the Virginia and Somers Islands companies. From that date until the dissolution of the com- pany in the summer of 1624 the council busied itself with the affairs of the company. No less than 31 orders are recorded which create commissions and empower them to investigate both the colony and the company and in the end to assume the functions of government in the name of the Crown, while seven of these documents pass directly between the council and the colony, and no other measures were con- sidered except those which enabled the Warwick faction to tear down the work of the adventurers and to take into its own hands the control of the entire business. These forms of government, planned by the Crown and the commissions here recorded, by which the authority was vested in the commissioners and later in a committee of the Privy Council, stand for the beginning of royal control. Here- tofore, with a few exceptions, these orders have been known only through the calendar of state papers, and even then not more than one-half have been included. The Privy Council Office and its records are located in the treasury building, Whitehall, London; the registers of the council orders are kept in the clerk's office but all of the early registers are properly about to be transferred to the Public Record Office. These registers contain the orders of the council, and, after Charles I, also the petitions received and the letters issued by the council. In the earlier reigns such documents were not recorded; whether they were even preserved as public documents is not certain, although, as stated above, many of them have found their way to the Record Office and are there calendared among the colonial, domestic, or foreign papers. There is a collection of such original material, dating from the close of the seventeenth century, in the treasury building.a a The clerk's office is entered from Downing street, but the library containing the original docu- ments must be reached through the main entrance on Whitehall. BRITISH MUSEUM The collection of manuscripts from which the most valuable returns might be expected is in the British Museum. The documents there deposited are small in number but they are of great value, and none of them have heretofore been printed. The originals of the precedents for patents of the Virginia Company, which are now noted for the first time, evidently formed a part of the records of the company, and it may be that they are some of the copies of the records made under the supervision of Nicholas Ferrar, or they may be the drafts of patents which were filed by the company according to an order of its court. Not only is the writing similar to much of that in the contemporary transcripts of the court book, but they are unsigned copies, and the headings of a number of them seem to be in the autograph of Edward Collingwood. The caption of the series shows that the copies were made for the sake of preserving the form, and reads as follows: "Presidents of Patents, Grants &amp; Commissioners by the Virginia Company. 1621."b b "List of Records," pp. 149 ff., Nos. 256, 257, 267, 276–278, 298, 299, 323–325. The volume is cata- logued as Additional MSS., 14285. The company thus preserved the legal form of the various grants. Four of them are of value not only for the form but for the knowledge they furnish of the distinction made between the four classes of adventurers: those who paid money into the treasury and agreed to plant one hundred persons, those who established a private plantation, those who were private planters, and those whose "shares exceedinge 50 ac? are exempted from payinge any Rent to ye Company for the persons they transporte." In addition certain knowledge is afforded concerning the grants. Two out of the other nine documents are commissions granted to owners and masters of ships for voyages to Virginia, by which they are to transport passengers to Virginia. Another is a covenant by the company to pay for the victualing and transporting of passengers, while still another is for the transporting of goods only. Other forms are those used for granting rights of fishing on the coast of America, for voyages to Virginia, and free fishing along the shores, and others still for discovery, fishing, and trading in furs in Virginia. The covenant signed by William Ewens in which he agreed to fit out the ship George reveals the form of contract required of the masters of ships by the company. These papers form the last group in a volume which contains "A Catalogue of the Nobility of England in the time of King James the first," 1626, and "A list of all the Officers belonging to Courts of Justice the Kings household &amp; Reuenue wth their seuerall fees." There are several signs for identification, but none which indicate the original owner of the volume. It is a small quarto in leather, bearing the signature, "H Cowle A. 29," on the inner cover, and also the arms of James Bindley with the motto, "unus et idem." At the bottom of the same cover is written the following: "Purchased at the sale of W. Berwicks library at Sotheby's, 27 Apr. 1863. (Lot 427)," while on the second fly leaf in the upper right-hand corner is the inscription: "The gift of Mr Dan1 Prince, Bookseller. Oxford—July 23d. 1776." Farther than this the history of the papers is unknown. Another set of documents in the Museum is also unique. One of these sup- plies all that is known outside of the court book and a single reference in Argall's register book regarding the controversy over the grant of land to John Martin in Virginia. The other letters from Martin to his brother-in-law, Sir Julius Cæsar, written in December, 1622, give startling suggestions with regard to an ideal policy for the colony. "The manner howe to bringe in the Indians into subiection wth out makinge an utter extirpation of them ..." is the heading of the paper in which Martin proposes to disable the main body of the enemy by cutting them off from their sources of supply at home and by destroying their trade. He would thus require two hundred soldiers "Contynuallie harrowinge and burneinge all their Townes in wynter." By this means and by gaining a store of grain for two years' supply, he plans for the recovery from the massacre. In order to secure the entire territory from the Indians, in a second letter he propounds a scheme by which the Crown or the company can make a "Royall plantation for gods glory his Matie: and Royall progenyes euer happines and the Companies exceedinge good." The responsibility and control was to be thrown upon the shires of England. The fact that the Martin letters have not heretofore been generally known may be due to an error in the catalogue. They appear under the name "Tho. Martin" instead of "Jho. Martin."a a List of Records, Nos. 378, 384, 385. Two other projects for the advancement of the colony are in the same collection of papers; one by Captain Bargrave, brother of the Dean of Canterbury, is dated December 8, 1623, and the other a year later. The latter relates to the division of income from tobacco between the King, the planter, and the grower, with a reward to those endeavoring to preserve the plantation, but approves the Ditchfield offer. The Ditchfield offer itself is also in this collection.a a List of Records, Nos. 604 and 733. Captain Bargrave's proposition for the government of the colony stands midway between absolute royal control and full autonomy of the planters, and holds an important place in the develop- ment of the plans from the proprietary to the royal colony. Furthermore, it is rather significant that in the collection of Sir Julius Cæsar are to be found the propo- sitions of Martin, of Bargrave, and the document by which the commission was finally appointed in 1624, to establish the government in Virginia under royal control. Sir Julius Cæsar, having been a judge of admiralty under Elizabeth and chancellor of the exchequer in the reign of James I, became master of the rolls on January 16, 1610/11, and one of the keepers of the great seal on May 3, 1621. His position evidently enabled him to secure a large collection of valuable drafts of documents. This was sold at auction in 1757. One-third of the collection was purchased by the Earl of Shelburne (Lord Lansdowne) from Webb and came to the Museum among the Lansdowne papers. Two collections of printed material of the company are to be found in England, the British Museum and the Society of Antiquaries. While the British Museum has a large number of the earlier publications, it possesses only the declaration of June 22, 1620, and also the unique note of shipping of 1620, the only other copy of which is owned by the Society of Antiquaries. The collection of that society is rich in royal proclamations, besides possessing a copy of the Note of Shipping, 1621, and of the Inconveniences of 1622. The scattering documents to be found in private collections throughout England are often valuable, but nowhere else is to be found any considerable number of papers or any that are of great importance.b b For those documents in private collections, see the List of Records. In the concluding section of this "Introduction" will be found a discussion of the collections which have been searched in vain for material relating to the Virginia Company. Furthermore, a statement will there be found of those families in whose possession we should expect to find Virginia records, because of their connection with the men prominent in the company or in the commissions which supplanted the company. A very helpful article, entitled "The Stuart Papers," is published by Mrs. S. C. Lomas, in the Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, new series, XVI, 97–132. 4. The Records of the Company under the Sandys-Southampton Administration Organization of the Company In order to comprehend what the records of the company were and what their value, it is necessary to gain an understanding of the system which the corporation worked out in order to further its purposes. The forms and usages of the company after 1619 were determined by the charters granted by the King and by the "Orders and Constitutions" which it adopted in 1619 and printed in June, 1620,a a List of Records, No 183. although the latter were altered or newly interpreted from time to time by action of its courts. The membership of the company was unlimited and was granted by the courts to anyone who had "adventured" £12 10s. for a share of stock or to whom the com- pany had awarded a share of stock for services.b b MS. Records of the Virginia Company of London, Court Book, Vol. I, Nov. 15, 1619. The distinction between a member who was free of the company and an owner of land in Virginia was brought out in a controversy on February 19, 1622/3, in which a proposition to limit the adventurers to those approved by the generality met with opposition on the ground that land in Virginia was held in free and common socage and could not be forbidden to any man. But Sir John Brooke, the legal authority in the company, declared that such exclusion was agreeable to the law since it was a question of a vote in a court and not a ques- tion of ownership of land. The argument was based on the power to withhold the privilege of voting from Samuel Wroth, who was under censure, and similarly on the power to exclude any man who had purchased land from a member who was indebted to the company until the debts were paid. This discussion also revealed that no oath of fidelity was required in the Virginia Company as in the Muscovy and other corporations. At a later date the King proposed that no member should be free of the courts who had not sent men to the colony as planters, claiming that less than thirty of the adventurers could meet the requirement.c c Ibid., II, Feb. 19, 1622/3; I, Nov. 3, 1619. The power to dis- franchise an unworthy member was reserved to the company. The members met in four great or quarter courts, held on the last Wednesday except one of each law term. On the Monday preceding they assembled in a prepar- ative court and on every Wednesday fortnight thereafter in a common or ordinary court, as required by the charter of 1612; and they might also be summoned to an extraordinary court by the treasurer or deputy. The meetings were held in the private houses of various members of the companya a MS. Records of the Virginia Company of London, Court Book, Vol. II, May 24, 1623. until the time of the tobacco contract, when a company house was established. In the quarter court the adventurers elected all councilors and principal officers of the company and colony, made all laws and ordinances, confirmed all grants of land, settled all questions of trade, and passed all measures which should bind the company for a term of years. Their action with regard to questions of a new charter and of investment for the colony was legal only when transacted in a quarter court, but they might transfer to other courts actions which concerned correspondence with the lord treasurer or similar business. Fifteen of the generality and five of the council formed a quorum for the ordinary courts, and in those they signed warrants, ordered the payment of bills passed by the auditors, and sealed bills of adventure. In that meeting also were perfected commissions for transportation of men and provisions and for trade and barter. Special officers and committees were appointed in this court, and even actions of great importance, such as the dissolution of the magazine or the extension of freedom of the company to hon- orary members, were consummated.b b Ibid., I, Dec. 15, 1619; Dec. 3, 1619; Jan. 12, 1619/20; Feb. 16, 1619/20; Feb. 22, 1619/20. The officers chosen by the company were a council, a treasurer, a deputy, auditors, a general committee of sixteen, a secretary, a bookkeeper, a husband, and a beadle. The adventurers looked to the treasurer or governor not only as the president and moderator, but as the manager of their business interests, and expected him to be responsible for the policy of the company in its relations with the govern- ment and to formulate and present plans for the development of the plantation and the profit of the adventurers. To him was entrusted the supervision of the treasury and the collection of moneys. The care of the court books was given to the deputy. It was his duty to attend to the engrossing of the orders and resolutions of the courts, the registration of letters to and from the company, and the formulation of statements to be given to the public. He also kept the court of the committees and supervised the issue of warrants. The council was a body, gradually increasing in size, elected for life, and was sworn by the lord chancellor or by the lord chamberlain. In the earlier years it was the most important committee of the generality of the company, but after 1621 its duties seem oftentimes to have been assigned to the auditors or to special committees. According to the "Orders and Constitutions" its chief care was the preparation of laws for the company and for the colony, the issue of instructions to the governor and council of the colony, and the formation of a preliminary court for the trial of the officers of the company or of the colony. But the practice in the courts was to refer to it those difficult duties for which its titled and distinguished personnel made it especially fit. To it was referred, as a final resort, the examination of the claims of John Martin, the attempts to gain a statement of accounts from the old magazine, and the settlement or arbitration of both the Bargrave and the Argall cases.a a MS. Records of the Virginia Company of London, Court Book, Vol. I, Nov. 17, 1619; Nov. 3, 1619; June 28, 1620. A body called the "committees" was at first composed of twelve members, six being chosen annually, but later the number was increased to sixteen, four being elected anew each year.b b Ibid., I, May 2, 1621. Its duties were chiefly to attend to the buying and selling of the commodities of the company, and to the furnishing of ships departing for Virginia. The auditors formed the other important standing committee, composed of seven members, elected annually. The chief duty assigned to them by the "Orders and Constitutions" was that of reducing to a book the receipts and expenditures. The court book discloses the fact that the company imposed upon them the burden of examining all claims against the company, as well as all claims of the company, of investigating the accounts of the lottery and of the magazine, of determining the awards of land or of shares for service or for adventure, of perfecting all patents and grants, and even of investigating controversies, such as the Bargrave and Martin cases and the dispute as to the seal and coat of arms.c c Ibid, I, June 24, 1619; Dec. 15, 1619; Feb. 2, 1619/20; Feb. 16, 1619/20; May 23, 1620. For a discussion of the seal of the company, see Cooke, "Clayborne the Rebel," in the Magazine of American History, New York, Vol. X (1883); and also Baxter, "Great Seal of the Council for New England" in Ibid., Vol. XI (1884). The other officers performed such duties as usually pertain to those who hold the corresponding titles.d d A report of the committee appointed to describe the "particular duties" of the several officers is among the Manchester papers. It is incorporated in the published "Laws and Orders." List of Records, No. 105. As the business of the company increased additional officers were chosen, as those for the control and execution of the lotteries and of the tobacco contract; while the custom of referring important matters to special committees grew rapidly, until in the later years many duties were transferred to them from the council, and even from the auditors. In this way such affairs as the securing of men to send to the colony, the provisioning of ships, the hearing of petitions, the investigating of claims, the sending of maids to the colony, the planning for new settlements and industries, the representing of the interests of the company in Parliament, the defending of the company in the suit of the quo warranto were intrusted to special committees.a a Court Book, July 13, December 15, 1619; March 2, 1619/20; June 26, July 7, 12, November 15, December 13, 1620; July 3, October 7, November 6, 1622. METHODS OF PROCEDURE In order to secure legality of action, the "Orders and Constitutions" were read at one quarter court each year, since in those meetings the measures of great importance were determined.b b Ibid., I, Jan. 31, 1619/20. That the forms and usages followed in other com- mercial companies, in other corporate bodies, and in Parliament greatly influenced the decisions of the company is seen in the following illustrations: The question as to the entry in the minutes of the names of dissenters or of reasons disallowed by the court except by special order was thus settled according to the practice in Parliament; to prove that individual adventurers would not be liable for the debts of the company in the management of the tobacco magazine, decisions were cited both in a case involving the corporation of Norwich, and in the insolvency of the Muscovy Company; when the question arose as to salaries in the tobacco business involving £100,000, the precedent furnished by all joint stocks of no greater capital than £7,000 was brought forward; the custom of private corporations as well as of judicial bodies of imposing a fine upon any man who spoke against the judge or the court was urged by Lord Brooke as a proper action to be taken against Samuel Wroth.c c Ibid., II, Dec. 11, 1622; Jan. 14, 1623; Feb. 4, 1622/23; Dec. 11, 1622. Elections were conducted by ballot, except for the council, in which case, as in all other matters, the will of the court was determined by an "erection of hands." The reward for services rendered by the officers was determined by the court and set down in the Orders and Constitutions. The annual payment to the secre- tary was £20, to the beadle £40, to the husband £50, and to the bookkeeper £50. Although the chief officials and committees received no salary, at the expira- tion of the year's term of office it was customary to award 20 acres of land in Virginia to each individual, with the provision that such land should not be sold. The company similarly rewarded individuals who had rendered great service, but sometimes it granted shares of stock instead, or agreed to transport for the indi- vidual a certain number of men free of charge. Shares thus given could not be sold below par value of £12 10s.d d Ibid., I, June 28, 1620; November 15, 1620; May 2, 1621. Each share carried with it the privilege of a vote in the courts and the receipt of 100 acres of land in Virginia on the first division, with a similar amount on the second division providing the first section had been peopled. In addition, the sending of a man to the plantation before midsummer of 1625 entitled the adventurer to 50 acres of land on each division. If a planter had adventured his person only, after three years' residence in the colony the company gave him one share of stock; or if a resident in England had sent a man to the colony who had remained there three years, the one who bore the charge was simi- larly rewarded. Through reward or by purchase an individual might thus own land and not possess stock, but he might secure the latter within three years by "plant- ing" or peopling his land. The result was that there were five classes of individuals connected with the company. (1)The old adventurer who had paid at least £12 10s. for a share of stock, and who thus owned, rent free, at least 100 acres of land after the first division which took place in 1616. (2)The new adventurer who had exactly the same privileges, except that after seven years he must pay 12d. to the company for each 50 acres gained by trans portation of settlers. (3)The adventurer who received a share of stock for service or for adventure of person and who would have the privileges of an old or of a new adventurer according to whether he received the award before or after 1619. (4)The individual who had received a grant of land for service or who had purchased land and had not yet gained the grant of shares of stock by adventure of his person or by sending out planters. (5)The individual who had purchased land of a debtor of the company and could not become free of the courts until the debts were paid. It will thus be seen that ownership of land and possession of freedom of the company were not always coexistent, but that each involved the possibility of the other.a a "Orders and Constitutions:" List of Records, No. 183. Court Book, I, May 2, 1621; June 28, 1620; Nov. 15, 1620. No assessments were ever levied upon the shareholders, the first sugges- tion of such a course coming from the Privy Council in July, 1623.b b Ibid., II, July 9, 1623. RECORDS PROVIDED FOR BY THE COMPANY The company was thus a body of adventurers, who had gained the freedom of the company by payment of money, by rendering a service, or by settlement of land in Virginia. It was presided over by a treasurer chosen by itself at will, and conducted all of its business through its regularly elected officers or committees, or by special committees. According to the "Orders and Constitutions" it kept a complete record of its actions in the courts and compelled its officers and committees to do the same. Provision was thus made for six books which were to contain the following records: (1)Copies of the letters patents, and also of all letters, orders, and directions from the King and his council, as well as the replies of the company. (2)The laws and standing orders passed in quarter courts for the company and for the colony. (3)A register of all patents, charters, and indentures of validity granted by the company, of all instructions issued by the council, and of all public letters sent to or received from Virginia. (4)The acts of the general courts. (5)The acts of the committees; invoices of provisions sent to Virginia by the company; the certificates of the receipts to be returned from Virginia; invoices of goods sent from Virginia with the husband's certificate of receipt or defect. (6)The names of adventurers, by payment of money or by rendering service, to whom shares of land had been given, together with the number of shares belonging to each person; the lawful transfers of shares from one to another; the names of His Majesty's council for Virginia. (6a)The names of all planters in Virginia on the public and on the private plantations separately, based on the certificates from the governor and council in Virginia and from the heads of each plantation.a a A note of such a list of men sent to Virginia during the time of Sir Thos. Smythe is among the Manchester papers. List of Records, No. 443. All of these books were in the custody of the Secretary, and were to be kept in the company's chest, together with the originals of the letters patents and all other papers. In his custody also were the husband's books of accounts of every voyage to Virginia, all accounts approved by the auditors, the canceled and uncanceled charter parties, and all bonds issued to the company. The proof of the care with which the company kept its records is found in the contemporary copy of the court book, and in a few scattering originals and copies of originals which are preserved among the Ferrar and Manchester papers and in the British Museum. That all of the books required by the orders and constitutions were really kept can not be proved, since not a page nor a copy of a page of many of them is known to be extant; but the copy of the court book serves as an evidence that the laws were as carefully obeyed in this respect as in others. The references in the minutes to many of these records, the inser- tion of many of them in the copy of the court book, and the continual provision for supplementary records all go to show that the "Orders and Constitutions" furnish a reliable outline of the records kept by the company. The books which the courts added to the list of records from time to time reveal an increasing effort to conduct the business in an orderly manner. Imme- diately upon assuming his duties as treasurer, Sir Edwin Sandys instituted an investigation of the accounts of Sir Thomas Smythe. In this connection four books and four rolls were prepared containing the subscriptions, which had been made for carrying on the business, and a list of the adventurers with the sums invested during the previous years. The treasurer made a similar request of the deputy, John Ferrar, on September 18, 1620, in which he asked that the secretary and Mr. Carter should make three catalogues of the adventurers indebted to the company in order that they might be given to a solicitor for collection. He throws light upon the customary carelessness by urging that the lists should be made "from the company's books and not from memory," lest many a £12 10s should be lost.a a List of Records, No. 211. On May 17, 1620, three books of the deputy were audited. The first contained an account of the money disbursed for provisions,b b Two warrants are preserved among the Ferrar papers, one addressed to the Earl of Southamp- ton and one to Deputy John Ferrar. List of Records, p. 149, Nos. 258, 259. the second, a catalogue of the provisions sent to the colony, and the third, a list of the names of the persons dispatched to the plantation with the trade of each. Because of the erection of private plantations in later years it was necessary that these records should be supplemented. Hence an order of court provided that the names of all persons transported to Virginia should be reported to the company and that a bookkeeper should be appointed to be at the house of the court to register the names before the departure of every ship. This record was to consist of the name, age, country, profession, and kindred of each individual and was to state at whose charge the transportation was effected. Contrary to custom each person was required to pay a fee for registration. A duplicate of the register was to be sent to the Governor of Virginia, but the names of those departing were not to be made public until after the ship had sailed.c c Court Book, II, Nov. 18, 1622. Provision was made in 1620 for keeping duplicates of all patents issued. A part of this series is now deposited in the British Museum, from which the various kinds of patents and the terms for each may be discovered.d d Ante, p. 67. "Order of Court," I, June 26, 1620. A registra- tion of all shares passed from one member of the company to another was ordered on November 19, 1621, and such a book was to be used as evidence of the right to be admitted to courts. Other records added from time to time were a book containing the rates of commodities,e e Court Book, I, Dec. 13, 1620; Jan. 31, 1620/21. a register of all petitions to the court, with the action thereupon,a a Court Book, II, Oct. 23, 1622. and a record of all covenants between adventurers and indentured servants, a copy of which was to be sent to the governor of Virginia.b b Ibid., II, Nov. 18, 1622; Nov. 20, 1622. The rolls signed by adventurers must have been numerous. Nine are mentioned in the court book on July 24, 1621, in addition to others cited at various times.c c Ibid., I, May 8, 1622; II, July 4, 1623. With the increase in trade and the establishment of the company magazines new measures were adopted for controlling the business. These often consisted of separate documents rather than books. A statement was thus required of the deputy certifying that the freight had been paid before any goods should be delivered, and invoices were also demanded of the cape merchant.d d Ibid., I, Apr. 3, 1620. Copies of such certificates, as also of the accounts of the treasurer of the various joint stock investments for the glass works and for the fur trade, were kept in the company's chest.e e Ibid., I, Jan. 16, 1621–22; Feb. 27, 1621–22. THE EXTANT RECORDS—THE COURT BOOK HISTORY OF THE CONTEMPORARY COPY The paucity of the actual extant documents of the company has made the circumstances of the transcription of the court book the more interesting and its authenticity the more important. As the growing controversy between the two factions of the company resulted in serious accusations of mismanagement by sundry adventurers and planters, the Crown soon appointed a commission to investigate the affairs of the company, with a consequent sequestering of all of the company's court books in May, 1623.f f Court Book, II, May 14, 1623. The clear mind of Nicholas Ferrar immediately foresaw the danger of a seizure of the documents of the company, and appreciating full well the value of the "court books, registers and writings, instructions, letters, etc.," as political papers and also as evidences of the possession of land and investment of capital, upon their return by the Privy Council, he "did fairly copy out all the court books, etc. (which cost 50li) and carried them to the noble Earle of Southampton."g g "Some directions for the collecting materiall for the writing the life of Nich: Ferrar," a manu- script in the Cambridge University Library, Mm. 1.46 (Baker 35), pp. 389–432, especially p. 392. During the following year the activities of Nicholas Ferrar, as well as the attention of other members of the company, must have been under great strain. The time not taken in attendance "twice or thrice a week"a a Peckard, Memoirs of the Life of Mr. Nicholas Ferrar, pp. 89–167. upon the Privy Council, and in the attempts to defend the company against the charges of "abuse of its privileges," was evidently devoted to supervising the transcript of the com- pany's records. The attestation at the end of each volume shows that the first was completed January 28, 1623/4, and the second June 19, 1624.b b According to the attestation two full courts were omitted, May 30, 1620, and June 1, 1622, and also a part of May 20, 1620. The Robinson abstracts comprise a little more than about one-half of the original records and are much more complete for the later years when the controversy with the King over the tobacco contract and the abuses of the company was being carried on. The part of the court book which reveals most with regard to internal organization, commercial activity, and inner life of the company is not included in these abstracts. Thus such data as that which concerns the trouble with Spain over the Treasurer, the suit with William Wye, the accusations against Samuel Argall, the old magazine, the Pierce patent, and many other private grants are not included. More- over, a comparison of the publication with the original manuscript shows that the John Randolph of Roanoke copy was used almost exclusively, and many inaccuracies have resulted. This was none too soon, for just a week later the Privy Council ordered Deputy Ferrar to bring to the council chamber all patents, books of accounts, invoices of the company, and lists of settlers in the colony, to be retained by the Privy Council chest until further notice.c c Order of the Privy Council, June 26, 1624: List of Records, No. 689. A commission had been appointed two days before to take into their hands all "charters, letters patent, grantes and instructions, bookes, orders, letters, advices and other writings concerning the company."d d The commission was sealed July 15, 1624: Ibid., No. 701. The com- pany urged in these words that the council should permit the books to remain invio- late: "So by this meanes [that is, by the transcripts] have the Original Court bookes yet escaped purging: And wth all duety wee humbly beseech yor Lops that they may hereafter be protected from it: And that howsover yor Lops shall please for the future to dispose of the Companie, that the records of their past Actions may not be corrupted &amp; falsified." Further, when the council demanded that the Earl of Southampton should surrender to the commissioners his copies of the records, before he sailed for the Netherlands in August, he sent them word, "that he would as soon part wth the evidences of his Land, as wth the said copies, being the evidence of his honour in that Service."e e For these quotations see Discourse of the Old Company of Virginia addressed to the Lords of the Privy Council, April, 1625. List of Records, No. 759. How these transcripts were made, and especially what became of them at that time, and where they remained for the following half century can be a matter of conjecture only, based on the divers statements of contemporary authorities. These are three in number: (1)The Discourse of the Old Company of Virginia addressed to the Privy Council, May, 1625. (2)The Memoirs of the Life of Nicholas Ferrar by Dr. Peckard in 1790. (3)A Short Collection of the Most Remarkable Passages from the originall to the dissolution of the Virginia Company, by Arthur Woodnoth, written between 1635 and 1645, and printed in 1651 by Richard Cotes.a a This pamphlet is in the volume entitled: Copy of a Petition from The Governor and Company of the Sommer Islands, with Annexed Papers, presented to the Right Honorable The Councel of State July the 19th, 1651. London, Printed for Edward Husband, 1651. The Discourse of the Old Company gives much the same history of the records as does Dr. Peckard. The facts set forth by the latter were taken from the "Memoirs of Nicholas Ferrar" by his brother John, about 1654, and therefore this work may be considered as based on contemporary authority. According to Dr. Peckard, Nicholas Ferrar, knowing that malice was at work, procured a clerk to copy out all the court books and other writings and caused them to be carefully collated with the original. It cost him the sum of £50, which he thought was the best service he could render the company. After the seizure of all the muniments of the company, and after Lord Treasurer Middlesex had procured sentence against the company, Mr. Ferrar informed Sir Edward Sandys and others of what he had done. These men were greatly rejoiced and advised that the copies be taken to the Earl of Southampton, who was so overcome that he is said to have embraced Mr. Ferrar and to have declared that he valued them as an evidence of his honor more than as evidences of his land. John Ferrar is quoted as having stated that the Earl of Southampton was advised not to keep these records in his house and so delivered them to Sir Robert Killigrew, who left them on his death to Sir Edward Sackville, the Earl of Dorset. Mr. Ferrar continues that the Earl of Dor- set died in 1652, but he hopes the records are still in the possession of the Earl's family.b b Peckard, pp. 155–156. Certain it is that Dr. Peckard had a large collection of manuscripts which concerned the Virginia Company, some of which must be considered a part of the records of the company, for such were the Ferrar papers described above which Dr. Peckard bequeathed to Magdalene College, Cambridge. That some of them, at least, came from the Earl of Dorset's family is to be concluded from the statement of Dr. Peckard that the "Duke had had his library searched and found a few loose papers, which he sent to him."c c See discussion of the Ferrar papers, pp. 59 ff., ante. Some of them doubtless belonged to Dr. Peckard's wife, Martha Ferrar. But the story of the purchase of the two volumes from the estate of the Duke of Southampton by Colonel William Byrd in 1673 or 1688 for 60 guineas has firm credence through statements of Mr. Byrd himself; and there is no evidence that they came from the Earl of Dorset's family. That they were sent to Tichfield by the Earl of Southampton before he sailed for the Netherlands and there remained until his son's library was sold after his death in 1667 seems probable. Perhaps some of the other records went to Sir Robert Killigrew, as stated by John Ferrar, and even some from which these copies were made. The statement by Woodnoth, who was a nephew of Nicholas Ferrar, that Sir John Danvers had the transcripts of the records made in order to keep out of the way an indigent man who had been employed by the company as a copyist and who might be persuaded to say something ill of Sandys and of Southampton, does not bear the stamp of truth or even of probability. There may have been a copy made by Danvers, but the internal evidence reveals that the existing volumes in the Library of Congress were not transcribed by any one man, and that the work was accomplished under the personal direction of Nicholas Ferrar.a a A Short Collection of the Most Remarkable Passages from the originall to the dissolution of the Virginia Company, pp. 17–18. The description here given of Southampton's attitude on receiving the books is similar to that given by Dr. Peckard. DESCRIPTION OF THE CONTEMPORARY COPY The contemporary copies of the court books, which are now in the Library of Congress and which may well be called the Ferrar copies, consist of two volumes of large quarto size well bound in rough calf. About 1898 the books were boxed, that is, repaired with new backs without disturbing the sewing. The old labels were pasted on the new backs and bear the title in gold letters on red leather: Record / of the Virgin: / Compan:/, while gold letters on black leather indicate the volume: Vol. / I. / and Vol. / II. / . In the first volume manila strips are pasted from the inner cover to the first and to the last fly leaf in order to strengthen the binding. The paper is of the seventeenth century type, hand-made and uneven in texture. In the first volume there are three hundred and fifty-four pages, with five fly leaves in the front and seven in the back, while the second contains three hundred and eighty-seven pages preceded by three fly leaves and followed by four, with two extra manila pages in both the front and back. The pencil entries on the first leaf of the first volume are as follows: "Records of the / Virginia Company / of London./ Vol I. April 28, 1619 to May 8, 1622. / Vol 2. May 20, 1622 to June 7, 1627./ The above title in hand of / Mr. A. R. Spofford / Sig.: H. F[rieden wald]b b Mr. Spofford was the Librarian of Congress from 1864 to 1897. Mr. Friedenwald was in charge of the Division of Manuscripts from 1897 to 1900. Oct. 11 / 97./". On the inside of the front cover of the second volume in an unknown modern autograph is: "p. 366 cf with p. 71 v 3,"a a The letter on page 366 is identical with that on page 71 of the fragile seventeenth century papers referred to above as Vol. III, pt. ii, of the Records of the Virginia Company. and on the first manila leaf: "May 20, 1622 / to / June 7, 1624." The discovery of the Ferrar papers has made it possible to make a final state- ment both as to the method of the transcription of the documents and as to its accuracy, for the autographs there found of Nicholas Ferrar and also of his clerk or business agent in his private accounts prove indisputably that these two men supervised and carried on the copying of the volumes.b b For examples of the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar and of that of his assistant, Thomas Collett(?), see the plates in this volume. Particularly in the second volume, where there are many entries of reports of committees, projects, objections, letters, petitions, declarations, and relations by the company or by individuals, the headings, the initial words, even the first line of each document, and sometimes entire documents are in the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar. The rest of the insertion is usually by his assistant, who was perhaps Thomas Collett, his nephew. All of the insertions in the first volume and about twenty in the second are entirely in the so-called Collett autograph, numbering about the same as those superintended by the deputy himself. The way in which these insertions are often crowded in, is evidence that they were copied from the original documents in spaces left for the purpose by the hired copyist.c c For the documents thus inserted in the Court Book see List of Records under "References." For an illustration of the insertion of the documents see the plates in this volume. As to the identity of the other three or four distinct autographs, in which the remaining part of the volumes appear, nothing has been determined. The first and third copyists are distinctly different in style, while what appears as the writing of a fourth and a sixth clerk may possibly be identical with that of the first. With the exception of the autograph of Nicholas Ferrar, the whole is clearly, carefully, and legibly written in the characteristic running hand of the period, resembling the chancery hand. The spelling, capitalization, and abbrevia- tions are distinctive and characteristic of each copyist. The use of curved lines to complete blank spaces at the end of the line, and often at the bottom and top of the page, shows the labor expended to make the transcript accurate and complete. The memoranda at the end of the volumes declare that the transcript had been carefully collated with the original "courte booke" and with the authentic docu- ments by the secretaries, Edward Waterhouse and Edward Collingwood, in the first volume, and by Thomas Collett and Edward Collingwood in the second. That the insertions were copied from the original documents is shown by the statement in the memorandum of volume II that in two instances the letters had been missing for purpose of collation. Many pages reveal the corrections of errors or omissions of the copyist. In most instances this was done by Edward Collingwood himself, though sometimes by Thomas Collett.a a For the evidence that the corrections are by Edward Collingwood, compare the autographs as shown in the plates of Vol. II, post. At the bottom of each page is the signature "Conc Collingwood," the abbreviation standing for concordat, as is shown by the word appearing as "Concord:" on page three hundred and fifteen of the first volume.b b Signatures of Edward Collingwood may also be found in the Public Record Office among the State Papers Colonial, II, Nos. 10–11, 13, 19 (II, III). His signature is reproduced from the first Plymouth Patent, June 1, 1621, in the Massachusetts Historical Collections, Series 4, Vol. II, p. 163. In addition to this internal evidence of accuracy, further proof of the care with which the books were transcribed is found among the Ferrar papers. The records of four courts were there discovered, which are almost identical with those of the same date in the Library of Congress volumes.c c Compare the plates in Vol. II, post. These courts are dated March 7, 1622/3, July 4, 1623, July 9, 1623, January 25, 1623/4. The only differences, and these are not numerous, are those which would naturally result from the fallibility of the copyist, and the apparent custom of the time to ignore the orthography of the original. One is led to believe that these loose pages of courts form a part of the book from which the copy was made. This is shown by the use of larger letters to emphasize certain words, and by Edward Collingwood's corrections of the Library of Congress copy to make it conform to these drafts. Even the omission of one or two lines in the Ferrar copy, later corrected, can be accounted for by reference to these sheets, since in each case it has resulted from the same word occurring in the same place on two successive lines. Furthermore, the directions in the margin of these courts as to where certain documents were to be entered were followed in the transcript and seem to point to these as a part of the original minutes. The autograph of the court held on June 25 is identical with that of the first copyist of the transcript, while the courts of July 4 and July 9 were apparently written by the sixth copyist of the transcript. Among the Ferrar papers are two drafts of a resolution concerning the "Lo T?er speach touching Mr Alderm. Johnson," which was entered in the court book. One is a rough draft written, altered, and corrected by Edward Collingwood, and bearing the above indorsement by the writer and a similar indorsement by John Ferrar. The other draft is in the autograph of the sixth copyist of the court book, following the above, and is attested by Edward Collingwood. The transcript in the court book is identical with the latter, but the vote is omitted; the substance, however, is given after the discussion follow- ing the presentation of the resolution. Thus they seem rather to have been drafts of a resolution which had been presented than of one prepared to be offered. Comparison between these records of courts and a draft of a Somers Islands court, in the same collection, leads to the conclusion that they do not form a part of the blotter or blurred book from which the original book was made, since the latter are much corrected and altered and then canceled diagonally from corner to corner;a a Post, Plates in Vol. II. but are rather a part of the original book itself. The reliability of the Library of Congress transcripts is also confirmed by collating them with the original documents, or with other copies of the documents, which are inserted in the court book, and these careful comparisons have shown how accurately Edward Collingwood and his assistants conducted the work for Nicholas Ferrar.b b For any variations of importance, see footnotes to documents in the "Court Book," post, I, II. THE SYSTEM OF KEEPING THE COURT BOOK The system by which the minutes of the courts were kept is thus outlined in the minutes; the court book was first drawn up by the secretary, was approved by the deputy, and later accepted or corrected by the court.c c Court Book, I, Dec. 11, 1622. That there must have existed a "Blurr booke" in addition to the various reports or other documents offered in any court is proved by an extract from a memorandum by Sir Nathaniel Rich, which is a warrant requiring all records of the court to be brought to the commissioners on Virginia, and includes the "Court Bookes wch should warrant the ?d Records, and the Blurr bookes wch should warrant the Court Booke and is the first ground of the Records; that it may [be] discouered whether there be any difference betweene them."d d List of Records, No. 465. The entries in the court book are the minutes of all the various courts, of several meetings of the Somers Islands Company, and of one meeting of the committees. Introducing each court is a list of the adventurers in attendance. A comparison of the number with the number of votes cast as recorded shows that these are quite complete for the quarter courts, but in the ordinary courts either the attendance was very small or the entry was incomplete, since the list is often terminated with the expression "and divers others." It was sometimes entered later than the transcript of the body of the text, as though from a book of attendance, but no mention of a roll book is found among the records. This part of the book alone furnishes a valuable comment upon the social classes interested in the undertaking and from it may be gained a knowledge of the faithfulness of the members and especially of the factions which developed toward the close of its history. The order of business does not seem to have been regular. The approval of the previous court is usually recorded first, although many times this is deferred until the quarter court; then follows the report of the treasurer, through which the important matters to be determined are presented to the court, and the hearing of petitions, passing of shares, and grants of land appear at the end of the session. In the ordinary courts were propounded all of those matters which did not require action in the general court and often many measures for preliminary dis- cussion which were postponed for final action to the fuller court. Thus the records of the common courts and also of the preparative courts usually contain the full reports and discussions of the various subjects, while the statements in the quarter courts are brief and perfunctory, embodying the decisions reached in the lesser courts. The reports of officers, from which so much concerning the financial status is to be learned, are entered in the minutes of the general court. To trace the course of any question necessitates a search through all of the courts, but in the quarter courts will be found the elections and the final action on all laws and ordinances, on the patents for private plantations or monopolies, or, in short, on all measures by which the company would be bound for a term of years. CONTENTS OF THE COURT BOOK The business recorded during the first two years of the Sandys administration concerned the establishment of laws and orders in the company and in the colony, the systematizing of methods, the formation of joint stock companies for the erection of new industries in Virginia, and the opening up of new adventures. But after the massacre early in the year 1622, the whole tone of the book changes. Personal feuds and quarrels, complaints, and accusations fill the pages. Whether the friction was due to the extreme distress brought about by the attack of the Indians or whether it was but the excuse for open opposition by the party of the Crown, which had been rapidly developing, is difficult to determine. From the spring of 1622 until February, 1622/3, the burden of the record concerns the tobacco contract with the Crown. It resulted in the discussion of salaries for the officers and the quarrel with Samuel Wroth, which occupied the attention of the company for three months. Then followed the Butler and Johnson accusations, the investigation by the Crown, and the dissolution of the company. It is literally true that, after June, 1622, no new measures for trade, for industry, or for commerce are entered in the court book. There was the usual transferring of shares and hearing of petitions and claims, but the business activity was evidently destroyed. That the colony could survive the massacre and continue its development with so little encouragement from the pro- prietor is evidence of the strong foundation laid during the governorship of Sir George Yeardley. From the court book it would be possible to reconstruct a part or the whole of some of the other records. A list of all of the ships departing or arriving with the names of the masters could thus be drawn up, but the terms of the charter party could not be determined.a a The terms in general are given in the Presidents for Patents in the British Museum. List of Records, Nos. 256, 257, 266, 267, 268, 276, 277, and 278. A full statement of the shares of stock granted or transferred, of the land assigned for adventure or for service, and of the private plantations erected could be given. Even a partial financial account could be rendered, though not an itemized statement. The larger sums invested or received from the various sources are usually given in the treasurer's plans and the officers' reports, although unfortunately only those of the treasurer and deputy are entered in full. But from scattered statements in plans, reports, and discussions, from grants, patents, suits, letters, petitions, and claims will come much that will illuminate the financial situation when these are gathered together. The full record of all documents for which record was not provided elsewhere was made in the court book. Plans, reports of committees, and reports of chief officers seem to have been entered in full, but letters to and from the colony, and to and from the privy council, petitions with the action thereupon, charter parties, grants for monopolies, lists of departing planters, expenditures and receipts of the magazines, and rolls of adventure, were all recorded in the other books provided by the "Orders and Constitutions" or in the books created later. A single illustration will suffice. Of the twenty-seven letters sent to the colony and received from the colony, copies of many of which have been found among the papers in Virginia, but fifteen are mentioned in the court book, and only a few are spread in full upon the minutes. A great many more documents are entered in the court book during the later years, due evidently to the desire to keep a record of the controversy which might serve as a defense against the accusations of the malcontents. That many of these were not entered in the original court book is revealed by the marginal notes in the extant court minutes of the Ferrar papers, which read as follows: "Enter the quietus est," "Enter the resolution," and other similar directions. The court book is not only a source of information, but it also serves as a guide to the other records of the company. That all of the twenty-one documents men- tioned but not entered in the court book have been found in other collections is most important and interesting. These include some of the publications of the company, most of the correspondence of the company with the King and with the colony, many of the orders of the Privy Council, the Admiralty suits of the com- pany, the laws passed in the colony, the charter granted to the colony, and the forms for patents used by the company. There are thirteen documents entered in the court book which are on record elsewhere, consisting of declarations or reports which were published by the company, petitions and letters to the King, and orders of the King's council. But thirty most valuable documents are spread upon the minutes which have not yet been discovered among other papers. These include a few peti- tions to the King, many petitions received by the company, a number of letters from and to the colony, the propositions brought forward in the attempt to form a tobacco contract with the King, the plans propounded by the treasurer for the advancement of the enterprise, and the declarations of the state of the affairs of the company and of the colony by the same officer.a a All of these documents, whether entered in the court book or not, are cited in the List of Records, and are also referred to by foot notes in this edition of the court book. THE EXTANT SUPPLEMENTARY RECORDS DOCUMENTS OUTLINING THE ACTIVITY OF THE COMPANY The organization and the method of procedure of the company have been outlined, in order to enable the reader to comprehend the nature of the records, and through them the machinery by which it conducted its internal affairs; but there is a wider and more important field to consider. The real interest in the company comes from its activity in carrying on trade and in developing the resources and government of the colony. Again, the starting point must be the court book, not only as a guide to the records which it kept in executing its purposes, but in discovering what activities are to be traced. Two kinds of documents afford the clearest outline of the subject; in one are the reports which the treasurer offered to the company and which are spread upon the minutes; in the other are the printed declarations and broadsides which the company issued for the purpose of securing interest, confidence, and investment in the undertaking. With the same motive it reprinted treatises and published sermons which had been delivered before the company. The first report of Sir Edwin Sandys after he became treasurer was offered on November 3, 1619, in which he thus defined his policy: The resources of the company were to be augmented by settling and developing the company's land and by increasing the number of industries to be established, an action which must advance the plantation from a colony for exploitation into a colony for settlement. The report begins with a statement of the number of men which had been transported by the company for the college land and for the public land during the summer and continues with propositions to the same effect, by which 300 additional persons should be sent to the colony, 100 of whom were to be maids for wives and 100 to be apprentices or servants from the city. The other measures discussed are indicative of the development which rapidly took place. First of these was the effort to establish other commodities in Virginia and restrain the excessive production of tobacco; the second was the encouragement of a spirit of local patriotism in the colony. The treasurer urges that men should be sent from the low countries to raise fortifications for the colony, stating that the colonists were willing to bear the charges of the work since they had recently been encouraged by the charters and grants of liberties. The dependence of the company upon the lotteries for an income and the care to arrange for an economical transportation of the men are indications of the financial policy and status of the colony. The income of the lottery is estimated at £3,500, and the total expense of perfecting the plan submitted is placed at £4,000 or £5,000. Six months later the treasurer made his annual report, which revealed to what extent his plans had been executed. It was issued as a broadside under the date of the court in which it was delivered and describes the state of the colony from April, 1618, to April, 1619, taken from a general letter to the company, and then proceeds to outline the successful activity of the colony during the succeeding year. It empha- sizes the erection of private plantations, the number of men sent to the company's land, the commodities provided for—there being ten instead of two as in the former year—the interest in the care of religion and education in the colony, and the stable financial condition of the company. The general receipts amounted to £9,831 14s 11d and the disbursements were £10,431 14s 07d, but the surplus in the college fund more than exceeded this deficiency, the receipts from that source being £2,043 02s 11?d and the expenditures £1,477 15s 5d. The lottery was reported to have an increase in stock over the previous year of £1,200. Although not re-elected treasurer, the financial management remained in the hands of Sir Edwin Sandys, as is proved by the entries of his plans in the court book and by his private letters to John Ferrar. A scheme outlined in the court of July 7, 1620, is practically the measure put forth in the printed declaration of June 22, 1620, and proposes a continuation of the policy stated above. The printed documents of 1619 and 1620 add but little to the plans revealed in the treasurer's reports concerning the activity of the company, although the measures taken to advance the comfort of the planters and of the tenants upon arrival in Virginia, the establishment of many private plantations, and the encouragement given to the self-government of the colony are brought out more clearly. After the note of the shipping in 1621, so far as is known, there were no propositions issued by the company. This was due to the massacre which paralyzed the efforts of the company for a time and forced upon it publications of defense and excuse or directions of warning. While the company was torn by dissension, after 1622 the colony slowly but steadily advanced. The proprietor was no longer active, and the center of interest is therefore transferred from the courts in London in which the plans had been conceived to the settlement in which they were maturing. The various publications of the company afford not only an understanding of the measures proposed, but also of their execution. They were in themselves a means of carrying out its schemes. Before 1622 five of these advertisements were issued by the company. The broadside bearing the date May 17, 1620, is a full statement of the prosperous condition in the colony, setting forth the ability of the colony to receive newcomers in its guest houses, newly built in each of the four ancient boroughs and in the other plantations, and describing the measures provided to sus- tain ministers in each borough. It states the number of men who had been sent to the public land, with the provisions allowed, and describes fully the efforts which had been made to establish six industries in the colony.a a List of Records, No. 174. A book of great importance was issued by the company in June of the same year containing a series of declarations.b b Ibid., No. 183. There were at least two editions in the year 1620, having variations in the title page; in the first edition the pages are numbered according to each pamphlet and the imprint is "T. S.," while in the second the pagination is consecutive from 1 to 92 and the imprint is that of Thomas Snodham. The latter varies also in the orthography of the word "colony" in the title. The former was probably the first edition and was composed of pamphlets, each of which may have been issued separately, and seems to have been reissued, with an additional pamphlet concerning a division of land in Virginia,c c The pamphlet must have been printed in 1616. An imperfect copy is in the British Museum. in which the signature is consecutive. Copies of the first issue of the first edition of the "Decla- rations" are in the Harvard Library and in the New York Public Library ("No. 1"), but the only copy of the second issue is in the John Carter Brown Library (copy "A"). The copies in the British Museum, the Cambridge University Library,d d This copy is evidently imperfect, since it lacks pages 91 and 92. the Library of Congress, the John Carter Brown Library (copy "B"), and the New York Public Library (Thomas Addison Emmet Collection, "No. 2") are identical and are evidently the first issue of the second edition. The copies in the New York Public Library and in a private collection in New York are probably a second issue of the second edition, having four additional pages and containing a declaration, "By his Maiesties Councell for Virginia," dated November 15, 1620.a a This is copy No. 3 in the New York Public Library. The copy in the private library is evidently the Smyth of Nibley volume, secured from the Cholmondely papers through Bernard Quaritch. The pagination and the signature are consecutive but the style of type is changed. The pamphlets included in all editions are as follows: (1)"By his Maiesties Counseil for Virginia." This is a declaration of the industries which have been established, of the good government which has been formed in the colony so that it "begins to have the face and fashion of an orderly State," and of the purpose of the company in the division of land. (2)"A Note of the Shipping, Men and Prouisions sent to Virginia, by the Treasurer and Company in the yeere 1619." (3)"A Declaration of the Supplies intended to be sent to Virginia in this yeare 1620. 18 Julij, 1620." (4)"The Names of the Aduenturers, with their seuerall summes aduentured * * * paid to Sir Thos. Smith," to "Sir Baptist Hicks," and to "Sir Edwin Sandys." (5)"Orders And Constitutions, * * * for the better gouerning * * * of the said Companie * * * Anno 1619, and 1620." Some light is thrown upon these publications by the court book, in which provision for four similar pamphlets was made between November, 1619, and June, 1620, as follows: (1)An advertisement for laborers, approved to be published on November 17, 1619. (2)A publication which should confute the slander as to the barrenness of the soil in Virginia, ordered November 22. (3)A list of the names of adventures with the sums adventured, ordered to be drawn up by the treasurer and Dr. Winstone, December 15.b b Such a list of adventurers is among the Manchester papers. List of Records, No. 58. (4)An apology for Virginia, ordered to be printed June 23, 1620. On June 26 and 28 it was provided that the standing orders should be printed and annexed to the book to be given to all members by order of the council. The conclusion seems valid that these pamphlets are the ones included in the book and that they first appeared at various times, but that finally in June, 1620, they were collected, the fourth one added, and the volume published under the date of the latter. The publication of this declaration in four different issues during the year 1620 indicates the interest which Sir Edwin Sandys had aroused in the measure, as well as the virility of the company, while reference to the book in much of the corre- spondence of the day reveals the same attitude toward the venture. In order to promote the silk industry a pamphlet entitled "Observations to be followed for making of fit roomes for silk wormes," written by Banoeil, was translated under the patronage of the company toward the end of the year 1620.a a This translation was ordered in an ordinary court on November 15, 1620, and was reported ready for the press on December 13. In the same courts there is a discussion of the prices of commodities produced in Virginia. List of Records, p. 138, Nos. 150, 151. It contains a pamphlet called "A Valuation of the Commodities growing and to be had in Virginia: rated as they are worth," in which is presented the astonishing list of 49 articles. The natural commodities which did not require especial cultivation, such as various kinds of fish, furs, woods, shrubs and berries, were of course included. But this proof of rapid development in the industrial habits and occupations of the colonists is most important, and the note of the shipping of the same year and the one in 1621 are confirmatory. In the former is the statement of the number of men sent for each of four industries, and in the latter a similar declaration. The rapid transportation of settlers and the development of private plantations in these two years is as sur- prising. Thus in 1620 six ships with 600 persons were sent to the colony, and 400 more settlers were to be sent at once, of whom 500 were destined for the com- pany's land. The next year the number of ships dispatched increased to twenty-one and the number of persons to 1,300, while the number of patents for private plantations grew from six to twenty-six. During the year 1622 the books printed by the company were much less valuable, although more numerous, there being seven in all. The Declaration of the state of the Colony of Virginia with the Relation of the Massacre of the English, by the Natiue Infidells with the names of those that were Massacred, by Edward Waterhouse, was more concerned with the disaster than with the previous development of the plantation.b b List of Records, p. 152, No. 293. A broadside is inserted in the copy of this declaration in the John Carter Brown Library, entitled "Virginia Inconveniences,"c c Ibid., No. 292. which was published separately and was a set of directions with regard to the provisions which each person should have before sailing for the colony. This included apparel, victuals, household implements, arms, sugar, spice, and fruit for consumption at sea, and nets, hooks, lines, and a tent for large numbers. The declaration was made that for its own tenants the Virginia Company followed the proportionate provision as set forth in this broadside. It is at once an advertisement for new tenants and a warning against the dangers which had wrought dissatisfaction and brought complaints to the com- pany. Two sermons and two treatises were published in the same year; one of the latter was a reprint of Banoeil's book on silk worms, including a letter of encourage- ment from the King and one of advice from the treasurer, which were intended to promote the industry of silk as opposed to that of tobacco;a a The first suggestion of a reprint of this book came in a court of October 31, 1621, but it was not until September 5 of the year following that the book was ordered to be printed, including the two letters. List of Records, No. 347. The sermons were Virginia's God be Thanked, by Patrick Copland, 1622, and one by John Donne. See List of Records, Nos. 312, 375. the other treatise was by John Brinsley and was an encouragement for the advancement of learning and the foundation of schools.b b An order of court, December 19, 1621, provided for an expression of gratitude to John Brinsley and an appointment of a committee to peruse and report upon his work. On January 16 the com- mittee was granted additional time, and Patrick Copland was asked to review the book and report to the company. List of Records, No. 291. Of the same character was a four-page pamphlet, which was published in the same year, declaring the sums which had been co?ected "towards the building of a free schoole in Virginia."c c List of Records, No. 289. A number of general works were approved by the company in the courts or were accepted and rewarded. Thus the proposition by Smith to write a history of Vir- ginia on April 12, 1621, seems to have been acceptable to the adventurers, while George Rugh, who had rendered service to the Virginia council by writing a treatise on government, was publicly eulogized upon his bequeathing £100 to the company for the education of infidels' children.d d Court Book, II, November 20, 1622. Edward Bennett was admitted to the com- pany as a reward for a treatise against the importation of tobacco from Spain, and the chronicler, Howes, was granted 12 pounds of tobacco as a yearly payment for his references to Virginia.e e Ibid., I, April 12, 1621. A number of works were suggested in the courts of which we have no trace or which can not be identified as appearing under other titles. To what the company referred when it petitioned the Archbishop of Canterbury for permission to publish the book which he had prohibited is unknown.f f Ibid., I, July 18, 1620. The printed book proposed by Sir Edwin Sandys on November 4, 1620, in which he wished to defend the lotteries and to hasten the dispatch of persons to Virginia, may have been the declaration of the shipping in 1620, but it is not mentioned again in the court book. In 1621 three other proposed publications failed to be executed, so far as is known, the first of which was a treatise on the government of Virginia by Thomas Bargrave.g g Ibid., I, February 22, 1620/21. The second was a defense of the company, and concerned the health, trade, and manners of the colony, and the third considered the defects and remedies of Virginia and discussed the food, health, fortifications, wealth, and religion of the colony.a a Court Book, I, April 12, June 11, 13, 1621. In the following year an attempt was made to collect the "binding laws which had been ratified in courts" and to add them to the printed books, but it seems to have failed, since no trace of such a publication has been found, and no final action is recorded in the court book.b b Ibid., I, November 19, 21, 1621; March 13, 1621/22. DOCUMENTS REVEALING THE MOVEMENTS FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY The printed advertisements between 1619 and 1621 were successful in securing the capital with which to carry on the enterprise. It now remains to discover how the trade was conducted and controlled, how the plantation was developed and governed, and how the business was finally destroyed. The income which enabled the company to provide for new industries in 1619 and 1620 was derived from the £12 10s. paid by each new adventurer for each new share of stock, and from the lotteries. Special collections and particular gifts for the advancement of religion and of education in the colony were frequent, and thus the account and management of the college land became important. Before the intro- duction of freedom of trade into the colony, and the dissolution of the old magazine on January 12, 1619/20, the company had some profit from that monopoly,c c Ibid., I, July 7, 1619. but the ease with which returns came from the lotteries had doubtless led the company to abolish the monopoly of trade which had become so difficult to maintain. That the company depended on the lotteries is indicated by the following statements in the court book: On December 1, 1619, the lotteries were continued until summer because there was no other means of securing money, and the plan put forth for the devel- opment of the colony on July 7, 1620, provided that the estimated expense of £17,800 should be met by the income from the lotteries, which would amount to £18,000. Information concerning the organization for conducting the lottery is wanting. Books and rolls and catalogues of prizes are referred to but have not been found.d d Ibid., I, June 24, 1619; January 12, 1619/20. Thus the only documents which throw light on the system outside of the court book are the records of the suit of the Virginia Company against William Leveson, an agent for the lottery in 1613, which discloses that books and rolls had been kept, and that a house for the lottery had been erected and furnished "at the west end of St. Paules Church;" a proclamation by the King for the overthrow of the lottery on March 8, 1620/21; and a few letters solicting investments.e e List of Records, Nos. 28, 29, 71, 78. The investments by the company during the period of the lotteries followed three lines—the old magazine, the planting of the public and the college lands in Virginia, and the erection of industries for the production of certain commodities. The court book is the only source of information with regard to the old magazine, in which the company through its general stock of the company had invested more than twice as much as any other adventurer. Hence, during the last half of the year 1619, it made every effort to gain an account and secure a settlement of that adventure. The discussion, which resulted in the adoption of free trade to the colony, reveals the system used for the control of the magazine, indicates to a slight degree the income which the company had had from that joint stock, and incidentally shows that it had some returns from the public lands in Virginia.a a Court Book, I, June 24, 28, July 7, 13, November 3, December 15, 1619. The numbers of men sent to the company's land and their equipment are given in the printed declarations, in the reports of the treasurer spread on the minutes, and in the discussions recorded in the court book, and although the sums invested for the purpose are not recorded, the statement was made by Sir Edwin Sandys that 800 men were sent through the income from the lottery. The transportation of dissolute persons in the year 1619 to meet the command of the King, and the settlement of boys and girls on the company's land previous to 1622, were other means used to people the public and college lands.b b Ibid., December 23, 1619; January 12, February 2, 1619/20; July 3, 1622. Five commodities enumerated in the broadside of May 17, 1620, were established by action of the court. No record is extant of the exact nature of the investment, but it appears from the court book to have been chiefly an investment from the general stock. The movement for monopoly of certain industries rather than a monopoly of all trade began during the latter part of the year 1620, and as a result the records deal extensively with plans for the sole importation of tobacco, by which a joint stock of £15,000 was to be raised to carry out what is known as the "Somerscales plan." The overthrow of the lotteries carried consternation to the company. An income was essential with which to send out settlers to develop the soil or to create new industries, but the general stock was so low that the company could not even carry out its plans for glassworks. Finally, after several months of discussion, recourse was had to special adventure or new joint stock companies for special undertakings, controlled by a treasurer who should be elected by the adventurers in the scheme. Thus followed the creation of a series of magazines for the erection of a glass furnace, for the establishment of a fur trade, for sending maids for wives, and for supplying a magazine for apparel. The records of these ventures are to be found only in the court book, and the data there given is very insufficient. This, of course, meant no advantage to the general stock, and the company was forced to discover means for securing returns from the general investment and an income with which to develop the company's land. Hence, private plantations were organized, and private patents and monopolies for the industry of pitch and tar, for ironworks, for new discoveries were granted, while special commissions for trade along the coast and for fishing added to the revenue. With the exception of the movement for private plantations and for the sole importation of tobacco, but few records exist outside of the court book to reveal these vigorous endeavors to reap the results of the great investments in the earlier years.a a The discussions in the Court Book with regard to the magazine, the development of commodities, and private plantations will be found through the Index under those headings. The grants for private plantations to individuals or groups of individuals, called hundreds, commenced as early as 1616, but increased rapidly during and after 1621, there being entries in the court book of over fifty patents granted in four years, which provide for the transportation of at least 100 men each and often for four times as many. The system by which each hundred in Virginia and the adventurers for the hundred in England was organized is to be found in the court book and in the extant records of the companies. The minutes of one meeting for Martin's Hundred and one for Smythe's Hundred, and the forms for patents deposited in the British Museum, in addition to about seventy papers of Berkeley Hundred, afford a very satisfactory reconstruction of the terms of agreement, the expenses, the provisioning, the form of government, the instructions issued to the captain or governor of the hundred, and the terms of settlement with tenants and servants. The adventures of Lord Zouch and Lord La Warr in 1617 and 1618, and of the Walloons and French in 1621, complete the series of which any record exists.b b For the documents on Berkeley Hundred see the Smyth of Nibley Papers in the New York Public Library, which are cited in the List of Records. See also Nos. 71, 72, 76, 77, 82, 227, 264, 735. These are really records of the private companies and fall under class VI in the List of Records. Among the forms for patents in the British Museum is that granted to Martin's Hundred: List of Records, No. 323. But the private grants did not promise sufficient income to meet the great demands for supplies from the general stock which the massacre of 1622 brought about. As a result the company turned to the income from tobacco, regardless of its high purposes and its endeavors to enforce the production of other com- modities. This feeling of the importance of a contract for the sole importation of tobacco took such a strong hold upon the company that from May, 1622, until its dissolution, just a year later, nothing else worth mentioning is recorded in the court book, while the quarrel concerning the salaries to be paid for the manage- ment of the £100,000 to be invested in this project monopolized the attention of several courts. In addition to the record of an entire year in the court book, numerous memoranda of various estimates of the value of the tobacco monopoly to the Crown and to the company are deposited among the Manchester papers in the Public Record Office. The communications with the Privy Council on the subject are spread on the company's minutes, and are also to be found among the Colonial State papers. This series includes the proclamations of the King in 1624, and the new propositions and measures for tobacco importation of the same year. The economic condition of the planter, the necessity of a revenue to the company, the amount of the importation and of the customs value to the King, the relations with Spain, and the economic values in England are all brought out in the estimates, discussions, and arguments.a a List of Records, 60, 102, 147, 184, 185, 59, 263, 287, 448, 392, 396, 410, 413, 411, 414, 424, 425, 431, 482, 676, 678, 680, 681, 682, 691, 692, 693, 695, 696, 703, 705, 712, 724, 729, 733, 737, 744, 747, 756.

DOCUMENTS DISCLOSING THE RELATIONS WITH THE COLONY The study of the relations of the company to the colony and the development within the colony may be based on a greater variety of documents than any other phase of the subject, especially with regard to the political conditions. The court book furnishes an understanding of the attitude and motives of the company and often serves to connect the data gathered from letters, instructions, commissions, patents, and grants. Thus the emphasis on the custom of martial law in the colony and the severity of penalty imposed is revealed both in the court book and in the extracts from Governor Argall's register.b b List of Records, No. 40, ff. The additional forms of government required by the development of the colony are recorded in the court book, by which the company created the offices of deputies to the governor for the college and for the public land, secretary, treasurer, chancellor, and surveyor, and provided for the compensation of officers by grants of land, by transportation of tenants, by the income of the company's land, and by allowance of fees.c c Court Book, I, April 3, May 15, 17, 1620. See also Bruce, Economic History of Virginia. The requests for the appointment of a council of State and for laws and orders, urgently repeated by Governor Yeardley, as recorded in the court book in 1619, give evidence that the source of such development was in the colony. But the fundamental law for the government of the colony is recorded in three documents, the instructions to Gov- ernor Yeardley, November 8, 1618, which created the land system, the instructions to Governor Wyatt, July 24, 1621, which emphasized the industrial development, and "An Ordinance and Constitution * * * for a Councill of State and Generall Assembly" in Virginia, which confirmed the political forms. These documents provided for the creation of two councils. The council of state, composed of the governor and council, was to form an executive and judicial body, and the assembly, composed of the council and two burgesses from each town or borough, was to be purely a legislative body.a a List of Records, Nos. 72, 260, 261. The approval of a quarter court of the company, which was necessary for legalizing the acts of the assembly, is referred to in the court book in three places only.b b Court Book, I, April 3, May 15, 1620. The constitution and the provisions for division of the country into cities and boroughs, recorded both in the instructions and in the patents by which the government of the private plantations was delegated to a private body, form the basis for a study of the local systems. The records of Smythe's, Martin's, and Berkeley Hundred referred to above, the correspondence of Samuel Argall with Bermuda Hundred, and the commissions for government issued by Governor Argall and later by the council of state complete the sources on this subject.c c The patents, the Argall correspondence, and the records of the Hundreds are new material and will aid much in an understanding of the local conditions and government. The precedents for patents are valuable in the information which they afford with regard to the position of the following classes of colonists: The old adventurer not subject to rent; the adventurer paying money for his shares and agreeing to transport 100 persons; the adventurer settling a private plantation; the individual planter.d d List of Records, Nos. 299, 323, 324, 325. These documents also throw light on the liberty of the individual, his exemption from taxation without his consent by the colony or by the private plantation, and his submission to a government almost military in character. The strict supervision which the company exercised over the economic, indus- trial, and social conditions of the colony is to be seen in the measures enacted in the courts and in the correspondence between the company and the colony, sup- plemented by a large number of private letters to the officers of the company. Four letters to the colony are mentioned in the court book, of which two have not been found, but eight others not mentioned are extant. It is more difficult to determine what letters came from the colony, due to the usually brief reports of the letters in the court book, to the omission of the date from the copies of the letters, and from the uncertainty of the date of the receipt of the letters as noted in the court book. Seven letters seem to have been received by the company of which no trace has been found, while only four of the ten extant are mentioned in the court book. It is apparent therefore that only a part of the official corre- spondence is in existence. The directions to the colony disclose the care and earnestness of the company, and emphasize the endeavors to establish the various commodities, while the descriptions given by the colonists are extremely valuable in the picture they present of their efforts, ambitions, and attainments. The pri- vate correspondence proves that the official letters were likely to give but one phase of the conditions. About thirty-five letters addressed to Sir Edwin Sandys during the years 1619 to 1621 have been found among the Ferrar papers, which are full of complaint because of the scarcity of provisions. Apparently Sir Edwin's policy to develop the plantation, and especially the company's land as a source of revenue, was overdone, and he was not as wise in carrying out his plan as he had been in forming it, since the colony was unable to provide for the large numbers sent out. These complaints are casually mentioned in the court book, but the Sandys-Ferrar correspondence shows that it was the desire of the administration to conceal the difficulties and distress of the colony not only from the public but also from the hostile faction. The Man- chester papers preserve letters, or copies of them, which came to the company or to individuals in 1622 and 1623 complaining of similar deprivations in the colony.a a For a citation of these letters in the List of Records, see the Index under "Letters." The company was not only interested in the economic and industrial develop- ment and the necessary political forms of the colony, but, as Sir Edwin Sandys declared, it had a higher purpose than the Muscovy or the other commercial corpo- rations. This high ideal is proved by the attention which is devoted to plans for the college, by the appointment of ministers, by the collections in the churches, and by the gifts received,b b Post, Vol. II, Index under "College," "Education," "Ministers." but the theory that the chief motive of the enterprise was religious is not supported either by the spirit or by the data of the records. RECORDS KEPT BY THE OFFICERS IN THE COLONY The acts of the administration in Virginia are recorded in the volume of contemporary records of the company kept by the colony which are described above. They consist of a series of nine orders and proclamations by the governor and council and of twenty-one orders, proclamations, commissions, and warrants issued by the governor as the executive officer of the council for the regulation of affairs in the colony. They cover the years 1621, 1622, and 1623, and concern the collection of taxes, the designation of laborers for public works, the regu- lation of prices of commodities, the restraint of relations with the Indians, and the control of the morals of the citizens. In addition to these documents issued by the governor is a series of twenty-four commissions and warrants issued to individuals to act as commanders of cities and hundreds, to carry on trade with the Indians, to make discoveries, to wage war upon the Indians, and to collect moneys. Another group of documents in the same collection consists of thirty- six petitions to the governor and council between 1622 and 1624. They are claims for wages and for moneys due, demands for fulfillment of contracts, requests for pardon and for justification in personal quarrels, demands for lands, and petitions to be allowed to return to deserted plantations and to England.a a For citation of these documents in the List of Records, see the Index under "Warrants," "Commissions," "Proclamations," "Orders." The only extant record of the council for 1619 is an account of the "putting out of the Tenants that came over in the B[ona] N[ova] wth other orders of the Councell," found among the Ferrar papers.b b List of Records, Nos. 138, 139. The "courte booke," or original record of the meetings of the governor and council, in which these petitions were heard and orders issued, is extant from 1624 to 1632, with a record of one court in 1622 and of one in 1623. These are mostly the actions of the council sitting in a judicial capacity and concern controversies over property, probate matters, and criminal charges. The punishment seem extreme. Two actions of the court are particularly interesting, one affecting Edward Sharpless for sending copies of the colonial records to England, and the other consisting of accusations against Captain John Martin of slanderous and false utterances. A few additional orders and warrants are preserved among the Colonial State papers,c c Ibid., Nos. 240, 521, 645. together with a report of the proceedings of the assembly in 1619, written by John Pory and sent to England, the only other account of which was sent to Sir Edwin Sandys by John Rolfe, and is among the Ferrar papers.d d Ibid., Nos. 116, 154. The acts of the assembly for March 5, 1623/24 are the only measures of that body during the life of the company which are extant, with the exception of the letters and petitions addressed to the company and to the King, and of a few orders. DOCUMENTS CONCERNING THE DEVELOPMENT OF FACTIONS AND THE DISSOLUTION OF THE COMPANY A series of documents remains which does not bear directly on the organization of the company or the expression of its activity in trade and in colonial enterprise, but is invaluable for a study of the history of the company, since it concerns the relations of the individual members to one another, reveals the inner life and motive of the company as a whole and of the various groups, and explains the conditions which resulted from the interference of the King and the overthrow of the corpora- tion. The entire movement centers about the growth of factions in the company. The movement begins in the years just preceding the accession of Sir Edwin Sandys to the position of treasurer, and seems to have had its origin in the trouble over Sir Samuel Argall and the appointment of Sir George Yeardley as governor of the colony. It finally involved many of the personal complaints and difficulties which presented themselves to the company, and therefore requires a study of those problems before it can be understood. The measures which thus arose with regard to individuals are to be found chiefly in the court book. They supply much information which can not be obtained elsewhere with regard to the methods of procedure of the company, and afford scattered data of great importance in addition to the light they throw on the disputes of the factions. The subjects discussed include such problems as the relations with the northern colony, the conflict with Spain concerning the ship Treasurer, the suit against William Wye for failing to land settlers in Vir- ginia, and various accusations against Governor Yeardley and Captain Argall for misgovernment in the colony. The accounts of Sir Thomas Smythe, the settle- ment of Alderman Robert Johnson's accounts for the magazine, and the illegality of Captain John Martin's patent for a plantation, were also questions which were of vital importance to the financial affairs of the company and took the atten- tion of numerous courts; but neither the accounts of Sir Thomas Smythe nor of the magazine were ever adjusted. The claims against the company presented by William Tracey, by William Weldon, the deputy of the college land who was superseded by George Thorpe, and by the heirs of Sir George Somers for a compensation for the Somers Islands are but illustrations of the many demands made upon the company. The court sat as a judiciary body to settle numerous personal quarrels, including the Brewster-Argall, the Argall-Smythe, the Bargrave-Smythe, and the Johnson- Southampton cases. Disputes which arose within the courts and resulted in slander and counter accusations took much of the time and attention of the company, the trouble between the council and Samuel Wroth over the question of salaries thus consuming the entire time of the courts for three months, from December to February, 1622/3. In the various collections in London are about a dozen papers which give additional information on the Argall-Rich troubles, the censure of Alderman Johnson, the Martin patent, the accounts of Sir Thomas Smythe, and the suits against William Wye.a a For the history of these cases as given in the court book, see the citations in the Index, Post, Vol. II, under the names suggested. References to the documents in the List of Records, may also be found in the Index. The documents which bear directly on the factional differences in the company are among the Manchester and the Ferrar papers. From them comes the insight into the very motives and thoughts of the opposing parties, and the proof that the accusations of the Warwick party are well founded, in so far as they relate to concealment of the sufferings and dissatisfactions in the colony, comes as a surprise.a a Citation of these documents in the List of Records may be found by reference to the Index under the Sandys-Ferrar letters, the Rich and Johnson memoranda, and the letters in the Man- chester papers. For a history of the factions the student must first review the reports of the personal conflicts referred to above and then turn to the numerous documents which include the accusations against the company, the defense of the colony and of the company, and the memoranda and letters upon the charges. When the quarrels had finally been carried to the Privy Council, the matter was taken up officially by the company, and the second volume of the court book after the spring of 1623 is composed entirely of documents spread upon the minutes which concern the action of the company. In fact, all of the papers after that time are of the same character except the records of the governor and council in Virginis. Since they number upward of two hundred, it will be impossible to discuss them separately, but it must be remembered that in them is to be found an outline of the history of the company reaching back into the time of Sir Thomas Smythe, presented first by one faction and then by the other. The most important of these reviews are the charges of Captain Butler, of Alderman Johnson, and of Captain Bargrave, with replies to each; the complaints of the adventurers and of the planters against the Sandys administration, and a declaration by the "ancient planters" comparing the two administrations in the colony. Finally, the "Discourse of the Old Company" is the last review of the whole situation. Another most important group of papers is a series of projects for readjusting the government of the colony and the adminis- tration of the company. The projects of Martin, Bargrave, Ditchfield, and Rich thus afford an opportunity to study the beginnings of royal control. The relations between the Crown and the company assume three different phases during the Sandys-Southampton administration—the first before the dis- cussion over the tobacco contract in 1622, the second concerning that contract, and the third relating to the abuses in the company and the dissolution of the corpora- tion. The court book shows a readiness and a desire on the part of the company before 1622 to refer to the Privy Council such matters as the magazine accounts which seemed beyond their control, but it also contains declarations to the effect that an interference with the patent rights is not to be tolerated. The questions arising in those years concern the transportation of dissolute persons to the col- ony, the right of the King to nominate men from whom the treasurer should be chosen, the restriction on trade to other countries, the refusal of a new charter to the company, and the dissolution of the lotteries. Supplementary to these records in the court book are the orders of the Privy Council affecting all of these problems. One of the most important documents, however, has not been found, since the efforts for a new patent can not be traced beyond the statement in the court book. It was first proposed November 15, 1620, and was ordered to be continued and to be confirmed by Parliament on January 31, 1620/21. On the 22d of the following month the Lords were appointed to secure the seal, and on April 12 the objections of the attorney-general, to whom the King had referred the patent, were discussed. That it never went into effect is certain, since no record is to be found among the sign manual warrants in the record office or in the signet docquet book. Furthermore, it is not enrolled in the chancery files, and it is not entered on the patent rolls, while in the suit of the quo warranto the only letters patent cited are those already known of 1606, 1609, and 1612.a a The Editor searched the following documents in the Public Record Office for a record or citation of this charter: Sign Manual Warrants, Nos. 11, 13–17. Exchequer, 19 James I. (1621.) Docquet of the Signet Office. Chancery Privy Seal, 19 James I, January–August. (1621.) The suggestion that a charter was reissued at a later date led to a similar fruitless search in the Chancery of the Privy Seal as Follows: 22 James I. July, August. (1624.) 7 Charles I. February, March, October–December. (1631.) 9 Charles I. August. (1633.) 14 Charles I. August, September. (1638.) 16 Charles I. April. (1640.) Unless the documents have been lost or the date of the entry has been mis- taken the conclusion must be reached that after the surrender of the draft of the new charter to the solicitor-general it disappeared from sight. During the year 1622 the communications between the King and the company concerned the tobacco con- tract and its final acceptance at the command of the King, and revealed the maturity of the policy of interference which had been developing during the previous years. The number of accusations against the company increased during the year, and the records of the early part of 1623 abound in letters of complaint and charges of mismanagement from the colony. The memoranda of the Warwick party, found among the Manchester papers, are also essential to the understanding of the movements toward the overthrow of the company. Many of the forty communi- cations between the King and the company are spread on the court book, while all of them are found in the Privy Council register. These include the commis- sions to the board chosen to investigate the affairs of the company,b b A record of the grand committee appointed to defend the company before the commissioners and a record of a meeting of the commissioners are among the Ferrar papers. List of Records, Nos. 394, 543. and the directions to the commissioners sent to Virginis. The correspondence between the King and the colony during those months of struggle concerned the latter commission and established the royal authority, but the letters from the colony were addressed to the company as late as the close of the year, six months after the judgment was rendered in the quo warranto suit. The record of this suit is found in the coram rege roll of the Kings Bench. In the entry the usual writ served upon the company is followed by the information read by Edward Offley, the attorney for the company, citing the letters patent of 1606 and especially of 1609. It enumerates the rights granted to the corporation, and claims that other privileges were never used. The third document is the reply of Attorney-General Coventry in which he prays for the conviction of the accused on account of the usurpation of privileges, and cites those mentioned in the infor- mation, claiming that there had not been sufficient answer in any point. The answer of Nicholas Ferrar and others states that the company is ready to verify its rights as quoted. The judgment was rendered on the morrow of Holy Trinity, and declares that Nicholas Ferrar and the others are convicted of the usurpation of privileges and that the "said privileges are taken and seized into the hand of the King and the said Nicholas Ferrar and the others shall not intermeddle but shall be excluded from the usurpation of liberties, privileges, and franchises of the same so taken from the King, and that they are to satisfy to the King his fine for the usurpa- tion of said privileges." The writ of quo warranto was issued out of the Kings Bench on the Tuesday next after the morrow of All Souls (November 4, 1623). The suit was opened on the Friday after the quindecim of St. Martin's (November 28), and was then postponed until the eight of Hillary (January 20). It was postponed a second time to the quindecim of Easter (April 11), and judgment was finally rendered on the morrow of Trinity (May 24, 1624). VALUE OF THE VIRGINIA RECORDS It has been the purpose of this paper to give to the reader a knowledge of what records the Virginia Company kept and to afford a guide to the extant records, as well as to indicate the character and importance of the various col- lections of records and of the various classes of documents. The value of this series of papers is threefold—it discloses the organization and activity of the company; it aids in an understanding of the various problems, policies, and con- ditions of the State under the early Stuarts; and it is of great importance in a study of the entire movement of the earlier and of the later century for exploration, for trade, and especially for colonization. The object of the previous discussion has been to show that an intimate knowledge of the mechanism of the company, of the methods of other corporations and business houses, of the policies of the company toward the plantation, of the growth of the colony, and of the change in the attitude of the Crown may be gained from the various documents. Thus the value of the records in revealing the methods employed by the company in conducting its courts, in keeping its books, in securing capital, and in finding investment which would result in immediate returns and enable the com- pany to transport men to the colony, has been pointed out. The evidence of the change of the plantation from a colony for exploitation to a colony for settlement, and the consequent effort of the company to stimulate exploration, settlement, and the development of resources, as well as the proof of the liberality of the proprietors in advancing self-government, has been outlined. The indication in the records of the colony that the control changed from absolute authority centralized in the governor to local management and government through a representative legislative assembly, and that the social conditions developed from life in a few compact settlements to plantation life has been suggested. Moreover, the documents which show the efforts of the joint-stock companies to gain protection and become privileged monopolies, on the one hand, and the tendency of the Crown, on the other, to utilize the company to relieve the country of its undesirable popu- lation, to secure a share in the revenue, and finally to assume the full proprietorship of the colony has been cited. The court book and other records of the company have another value in that they incidentally aid in an understanding of many problems of the government. Thus the attitude of the King toward the company was much influenced by his desire for marriage relations with Spanish royalty. Various questions of policy were often discussed in the meetings of the company, such as the freedom of trade and of fishing, monopolies, customs, and shipping, while the financial aid given to colo- nization by Spain is cited in contrast to the action of England, and the favor to the Spanish colonies by the State in allowing the sole importation of certain products was dwelt upon. The desire to cement the colony to the State and the necessity of avoiding separation was much emphasized, but the wisdom of allowing self-government to the colony was never once forgotten. In fact, the argument that democracy was unavoidable, since the planter had the privilege of the adventurer, was urged in opposition to the accusations of the King that the company favored democratic forms. This spirit in the company is also seen in the tendency to address Parliament whenever possible, as illustrated in the movement for a new patent and in the settlement of the tobacco question. The economic and industrial situation in England is perhaps better revealed than any other phase of affairs. Thus the commodities which were in demand and not produced in England, the rates of such commodities, the prices of necessities, and the system of vending goods were all matters of great importance to the company, and appear again and again in the various documents. The poverty of skilled labor is shown in the necessity the company was under to go to the Continent for men to superintend and carry on every industry which it attempted to establish in the col- ony. Dutchmen, Swedes, Poles, and Frenchmen were thus imported for conducting sawmills, cultivating silkworms, and making potash, clapboards, salt, wines, and glass. When engineers for constructing fortifications were desired, General Cecil declared that he had not men for the purpose, but hoped he might be able to recom- mend some Frenchmen of ability. The papers which concern the transportation of vagabonds and of boys and girls furnish a comment on a special phase of social life, while the spirit of the entire records reveals the demand for an outlet for activity and an opportunity for investment. Throughout, the minutes of the courts and the correspondence and references to the other trading companies emphasize the strong similarity between their organization and that of the Virginia corporation. Illustrations of this fact are seen in the citation of the precedent from other joint-stock companies of employing a deputy and a director, of the salaries paid in the East India Company, and of the liberty of trade enjoyed by the Muscovy Company; while among the Ferrar papers are drafts of petitions from the Commons to the King in the writing of Nicholas Ferrar on behalf of the Turkey merchants and of the "Ginny and Binny" company, showing the intimate relations between the different movements. Perhaps the most important result of a study of the Virginia Company comes from the knowledge which may be gained of the whole movement which had as its object exploration, trade, and settlement before and since the time of the company in all of the colonies. In its records are to be found one of the earliest sources of information concerning colonial experience from the English standpoint, and hence through them may be gained an understanding of the way in which proprietary colonies were established; of the development of the plantation into a colony of settlement; and of the consequent relation between the settlers and the proprietor. These steps as well as those by which the Crown was led to resume the authority and to establish a royal proprietorship in place of that of a company or of an indivi- dual, and the consequent development of the freedom of the settler were repeated in the history of all of the proprietary colonies of America. 5. The Fate of the Original Recordsa a That the Virginia Company had a large number of records which are not now extant has been reveled by a study of the existing documents. In addition to the original court books and the five other records provided for by the "Orders and Constitutions" there were the books created at a later date, the duplicates of patents and grants, the petitions, and all of the account books of the various magazines and joint stock companies. If the papers of the private plantations and hundreds which are represented by the Smyth of Nibley papers, were added to these, the volume of missing records would become very great. A discussion therefore of what resources have been searched, though in vain, seems desirable, in order to aid further investigation. It was in July, 1622, that the controversy between the factions in the company was first brought before the Privy Council, and, strangely enough, the plaintiff was John Bargrave, who later championed those whom he now accused. The complain- ant declared that he had lost 6,600 pounds through the "unjust practices and miscarriage of government" on the part of Sir Thomas Smythe and Alderman Robert Johnson. The matter was referred to a committee composed of Lord Viscount Grandison, Lord Brook, the master of the rolls, Lord Keeper Coventry, and Secretary Conway, but the affair dragged on in the council until it was finally settled on January 22, 1622/3, by its ordering Bargrave to forbear troubling Sir Thomas Smythe.b b List of Records, Nos. 351, 401. From that time the battle between the factions in the company had begun. The tobacco contract between the lord treasurer as representative of the King on the one hand and the company on the other, which had occupied so much of the time of the courts, was allowed by the Privy Council on the 2d of February.c c Ibid., No. 401. But the spirit of conflict was seen in the entire correspondence, and during the few succeeding months bitter complaints concerning the mismanagement of affairs in the colony were made by Nathaniel Butler in his Unmasking of the Colony of Virginia and by Alderman Johnson in his Declaration.d d Ibid., Nos. 388, 395. That both of these originated in the Warwick faction has been revealed by the Manchester papers. On April 17 a committee headed by Lord Cavendish was summoned before the Privy Council to defend the Virginia Company against the "grievances of Planters and Adventurers." As a result, the first blow was struck at the liberty of the company when the Privy Council announced that it was the King's intention that a commission should be appointed to inquire into the state of the Virginia and Somers Islands plantations.a a List of Records, No. 467. Printed in full in Le Froy, I, 289–290. From that time the affairs of the company were under surveillance, and the correspondence, the trade, and even the personal liberty of its officers were subject to restraint. The company was immediately forbidden to receive any private letters except on its own business, while on the 28th of the same month its letters were disallowed by the Privy Council because they failed to "certify the King's grace to the Colonies." Already the court books and other writings had been required of the secretary of the company, as is shown by a receipt for the same, dated April 21, among the Ferrar papers. This receipt was given to Edward Collingwood by the clerk of the council. As a concomitant the council dissolved the tobacco contract and reduced the former customs on tobacco from twelve to nine pence per pound. It allowed the companies the sole importation of tobacco, but it required that the whole crop should be brought into England.b b List of Records, Nos. 476 and 478. There were other acts which partook of the same spirit as the interference with the correspondence and business of the company. On May 13 the Privy Council ordered that Lord Cavendish, Sir Edwin Sandys, and Nicholas and John Ferrar should be confined to their house, a punishment inflicted for a contempt of an order of the council table against the use of bitter invectives, and brought about by the complaint of the Earl of Warwick. Lord Cavendish was in restraint five days and the others eight days. The release came as a result of their "acknowledgment of offence and expression of sorrow."c c See Orders in Council, cited in Ibid., Nos. 506 and 510. The threat of the King was carried out, and the declaration of war was made on May 9 by the appointment of a commission to investigate the disputes in the Virginia Company and to report upon their method of procedure. The danger of confiscation of the company's records was fully realized for the the first time on May 22, 1623, when the Privy Council enforced a previous order to surrender "all Charters Books, (and by name the blurred Book or Books), Letters, Petitions, Lists of Names and Provisions, Invoyces of Goods, and all other writing whatsoever, and Transcripts of them, belonging to them." The new order declared that the "Blurred Book or Books" had been kept back. The documents were to be surrendered to the clerk of the council, but the custody of the records was given to the commissioners. Each party was to have free use of them "in such sort as to ye Commissioners shall seem good." Furthermore "all Boxes &amp; Packages of Letters which hereafter shall be brought over from Virginia or ye Summer Islands during this Commission" were to be "immediately delivered to ye Commissioners by them to be broken open, perused or otherwise disposed [of] as they shall find cause."a a List of Records, No. 513. The records were in the possession of the clerk of the council from the date of this order, or earlier, until November 7, 1623, as is shown by a warrant bearing the latter date, in which the commissioners of May 9 required of the council a "trunk of writings" locked up under the custody of the Privy Council to be delivered to the "bearer."b b Ibid., No. 580. A careful search for the missing papers must commence at this point. Although the records, or at least the court books, were later returned to the company, some of them may have been retained by the commissioners or by individuals thereof. Therefore, hidden away in the collections of the heirs of these men, it might be supposed, would be found the much sought-for documents. The members of this commission, created April 17, were Sir William Jones, Sir Nicholas Fortescue, Sir Francis Gofton, Sir Richard Sutton, Sir William Pitt, Sir Henry Bouchier, and Sir Henry Spiller.c c For the order in council creating this commission, see Ibid., No. 499. But, as far as can be determined from personal investigation, from the report of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts, from conversa- tion with Sir Henry Maxwell Lyte, of that body, or from other men conversant with the private and public depositories in England, none of the papers did remain in the possession of those commissioners. A committee of the Privy Council may have had access to these papers, for on July 22 Lords Grandison, Carew, and Chichester were appointed to take into con- sideration the reports on the colony and to present to the council orders most fit for the regulation of the government of Virginia.d d Ibid., No. 547. Another group of men intrusted with the investigation of affairs at that time, and into whose hands and private possession might have come papers belonging to the company, were John Harvey, John Pory, Abraham Percy, Samuell Matthews, and John Jefferson. This commis- sion was sent to Virginia for the purpose of investigating conditions, and many of the documents bearing on their relations with the colony are among the colonial State papers. The documents remained in the custody of the commission until November 21, and were then returned to the secretary of the company. An order in council declared that all the "Books and writings, whether remayneing in the hands of the Comrs or elswher, shalbe fwthwth deliuered by Inventorie vnto the said Company." The complaint had been made by the treasurer that they could not make answer to the quo warranto which had been issued out of the King's Bench against the company without the use of their records.e e Ibid., No. 593. Therefore, from November, 1623, until June, 1624, the company was in possession of its documents, and it was during that period that Nicholas Ferrar was busily engaged in having them transcribed. The last order which concerned these records from December 30, 1623, until the company was finally overthrown, in June of the following year—when the organi- zation, according to Nethersole, became a company for trade and not for government— was a letter of the council to "Nicholas Ferrar, Deputie," to bring to them unopened all letters which had come in a ship lately arrived from Virginia.a a For the order in council creating this commission, see List of Records, No. 608. That the King in the meantime was concerned in the preservation of all papers relating to Virginia is seen in a letter from Secretary Conway to Sir Thomas Merry, in which he was requested to preserve all papers in the possession of "his late cousin," John Puntis, vice-admiral of Virginia, and any others which concerned the business.b b List of Records, No. 683. Following up the recall of the charter, the Privy Council declared that it was the King's intention to renew the charter of the company without the imperfections of the former grant. A committee was therefore appointed on June 24 to resolve on the well settling of the colony, to give the orders therefor, and to report to the King for further directions. This body consisted of Lord President Mandeville, Lord Paget, Lord Chichester, the lord treasurer, the comptroller, the principal secretaries of state, the chancellor of the exchequer, the chancellor of the duchy, the attorney- general, the solicitor-general, Sir Robert Killigrew, Sir Thomas Smythe, Francis Gofton, John Wolstenholme, and Alderman Johnson.c c Ibid., No. 687. Two days later an order in council was issued instructing Mr. Ferrar, deputy of the company, to bring to the council chamber all patents, books of accounts, and invoices of the late corporation and all lists of people in the colony, to be retained by the keeper of the council chest till further order.d d Ibid., No. 689. Thus was ended the control of the government by the old organization, if not of the affairs of the company and its colony, and thus the records passed into the charge of the clerk of the Privy Council. A commission to establish a government in Virginia is to be found in the chan- cery privy seals under July of the twenty-second year of James I, countersigned to pass by immediate warrant. The patent roll of the period records this commission, dated July 15, 1624, by which the Virginia Company was to be supplanted and the first royal province in America was to be established.e e Ibid., No. 701. The records of the old com- pany, however, are not lost to sight till three days later. On July 15 the commis- sioners met at Sir Thomas Smythe's house and determined that the charters, seals, and writings of the company were to be brought to Sir Thomas Smythe's house and kept in charge of the clerk of the commissioners, H. Fotherby, to be used by the commissioners at pleasure.a a List of Records, No. 702. In the Privy Council register, under date of June 26, 1624, there is an order for Mr. Ferrar to deposit in the council chamber the papers of the late corporation, and in the margin is a note which gives the last glimpse of those records. It reads as follows: "Nd: All theis Patents bookes of accounts &amp;c were delivered to Henry Fotherby clarke to the Commissioners, by order from the Lords the 19 of July 1624."b b Ibid., No. 689. That these members of the Privy Council and others of the commissioners for Virginia had all of the original records of the company in their possession at that date is thus proved. What became of them later can be a matter only of specu- lation. That they had been so carefully preserved and were deposited "for use by the members of the commissioners," seems to indicate that the theory of their destruction by the Crown is not tenable. There are two theories which seem much more likely. it may be that they passed finally into the possession of the Privy Council, which evidently soon assumed the burden of the control of the affairs of the province; for, on May 13, 1625, a royal proclamation arranged for a council which was to the subordinate to the Privy Council.c c A letter to the Earl of Warwick dated November 16, 1624, bears the signatures of the council for Virginia as follows: Sir Thomas Smith, Ferdinando Gorges, John Wolstenholme, Samuel Argall, Thomas Gibbs, Samuel Wrot, and John Pory. There had been some question concerning the addition of names to the commission, but whether this is a portion only of the council of July 15 or a new organization is uncertain. Ibid., No. 738. The papers may thus have remained with the King's Council until the creation of the commission for Virginia in 1631, which in turn was supplanted by the Board of Commissioners for Foreign Plantations in 1634.d d The members of the commission for Virginia appointed June 17, 1631, were: Edward Earl of Dorset, Henry Earl of Danby, Dudley Viscount Dorchester, Secretary Sir John Coke, Sir John Danvers, Sir Robert Killigrew, Sir Thomas Rowe, Sir Robert Heath, Mr. Recorder [Heneage Finch], Sir Dudley Diggs, Sir John Wolstenholme, Sir Francis Wiatt, Sir John Brooke, Sir Kenelm Digby, Sir John Zouch, John Bankes, Thos. Gibb, Nath. Rott [Wrote?}, Mr. Sands, John Wolstenholme, Nicholas Ferrar, Mr. Barber, and John Ferrar. See Colonial Papers, Vol. VI, No. 14. The commissioners for plantations appointed April 28, 1634, were: William Land, Archbishop of Canterbury; Thomas Lord Coventry, lord Keeper; Richard Neile, Archbishop of York; Richard Earl of Portland, lord high treasurer; Henry Earl of Manchester; and seven other officers of state. The commission created in July of 1624 was composed of the lords of the council and "certain others," and the council register seems to indicate that it was usually the council sitting as a commission. After 1624 the papers, letters, and instructions were all issued by the council, the commissions to the councillors and to governors of the colony passed the privy seal and were engrossed on the patent roll, and the letters or papers from the colony were addressed to the council. Another theory as to the fate of the records is that they were at first in charge of Henry Fotherby, clerk of the commissioners, but that they were gradually scattered among the members of the commission most interested in the career of the company as the authority of the commission became purely that of government. The members of the commission, created July 15, 1624, in whose families such papers might be found, are as follows: Henry Viscount Mandeville, Lord President of the Council, Wm. Lord Paget, Anthony Lord Chichester, Sir Thomas Edmonds, Sir John Suckling, Sir Geo. Calvert, Sir Edward Conway, Sir Richard Western, Sir Julius Caesar, Sir Humphrey May, Sir Saville Hicks, Sir Thomas Smith, Sir Henry Mildmay, Sir Thomas Coventry, Sir Robert Heath, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, Sir Robert Killigrew, Sir Charles Montague, Sir Philip Carew, Sir Francis Goston [Gofton], Sir Thomas Wroth, Sir John Wolstenholme, Sir Nathaniel Rich, Sir Samuel Argall, Sir Humphrey Handford, Mathew Sutcliff, Dean of Exeter, Francis White, Dean of Carlisle, Thomas Tamshaw, Alderman Robert Johnson, James Cambell, Ralph Freeman, Morris Abbott, Nathaniel Butler, George Wilmore, William Hackwell, John Mildmay, Philip Germayne, Edward Johnson, Thomas Gibbes, Samuel Wrote, John Porey (?), Michael Hawes, Edward Palavacine, Robert Bateman, Martin Bond, Thomas Styles, Nicholas Leate, Robert Butt, Abraham Cartwright, Richard Edwards, John Dyke, Anthony Aldy, William Palmer, Edward Ditchfield, George Mole, and Richard Morer.a a Virginia Magazine of History, VII, 40. Had not the receipt from the Privy Council to the secretary of the company revealed the existence of the early records in 1623, and had not the memoranda of Sir Nathaniel Rich confirmed the fact,b b Ante, pp. 25, 63. the theory might be put forth that the papers of the early period were burned in the destruction of Sir Thomas Smythe's house at Deptford on February 6, 1618/19. The fire at Whitehall on the 16th of January, 1618/19, at which the privy seal, signet, and council records are supposed to have been destroyed, is sometimes suggested as the cause of the disappearance of the Virginia records. But the facts given above, in addition to the statement of Sir Thomas Wilson to the King that there had been but little loss of papers since they had been transferred to the new office refutes that theory.c c Documents relating to the History of the Public Record Office, in the Record Office. It remains for the future enquirer to examine the collections which are known to contain papers belonging to the families indicated by the names of the various com- missioners and of the Privy Councillors for that period. Such investigations are made difficult by the transfer of papers from one branch of a family to another, necessitating a knowledge of the genealogy of the various families represented. Having found the heirs of the families in question, the search may then be conducted through the reports of the Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts. But this is not sufficient. Since trace of the family is often lost, or no evidence can be found of collections of docu- ments, it becomes necessary to search through every section of those reports of the commission for stray sets of papers. The greatest confusion also results from the sale of libraries, and while the catalogues of Quaritch or Sotheby may afford a clue to the offer of such material for sale, often in small lots, the name of the purchaser is not usually to be discovered. The result is that the student must wait in patience until the papers have drifted into some great depository—such as the British Museum and the Bodleian Library—or until they have been made known to the public through the Manuscripts Commission or by private enterprise.a a The search for the records has not only been conducted along these lines, but the collections belonging to the families of the officers of State under James I, and Charles I, have been investigated. Another difficulty, which can not be overcome by the individual student, is the insufficiency of the catalogues of early date. This is gradually being met by the re-issue of catalogues and calendars in the British Museum, and the Bodleian, although the new catalogue of the latter is only "summary." The Ashmolean and Rawlinson papers in the Bodleian may afford many surprises. Furthermore, the early reports of the Manuscripts Commission were often incomplete and too general in character. However, the more recent volumes are full calendars, and the older volumes may be republished in time. In the great collections of the British Museum are brought together the papers or portions of the papers of a few of the men with whom we are concerned. In the Lansdowne collection are about one-third of the papers of Sir Julius Caesar, master of the rolls, which were sold at auction in 1757. Among these have been found the valuable letters of John Martin and the draft of the commission of 1624. In the Harleian collection, brought together by Robert Harley, Earl of Oxford, at the close of the seventeenth century, and among the papers of Sir John Cotton, who was a noted antiquarian of the time of James I, are a few important documents. The valuable collection of the Marquis of Bath, containing the Cecil papers, has been recatalogued and found to contain nothing which concerns the company after 1616, and nothing of the earlier period not known to Alexander Brown. Two other collections, imperfectly calendared by the Manuscripts Commission, are those of Lord Sackville, of Knole, Seven Oaks, Kent, and of the Earl of Coventry, Croome Court, Severn Stoke, Worcestershire. Since the statement was made by John Ferrar, in the later years of his life, that Sir Robert Killigrew had left the Virginia papers to Sir Edward Sackville, the Earl of Dorset, our interest in this collection is intensified. Both Sir Robert Killigrew and Richard Sackville, Earl of Dorset, are seen to have been vitally connected with the company and the settle- ment of its affairs. Two other connections of this family may have brought together collections which might contain Virginia papers. Richard Sackville, Earl of Dorset, married Frances, the daughter of Lionel Cranfield, the first Earl of Middlesex, and he himself became heir to the Cranfield house and title as third earl. The first Earl of Middlesex was the lord treasurer during the régime of the company and figures prominently as the individual who conducted the quo warranto suit against the Virginia Company. Furthermore, Lionel Sackville West is the direct descendant of Lord De La Warr, of Virginia fame. The combination of the four houses of Killigrew, Sackville, Middlesex, and De La Warr, which were of so great importance in Virginia affairs, leads to the hope of a valuable collection of manuscripts. Four documents are mentioned in the report of the commission, and these refer to the tobacco trade, but an inquiry of Lord Sackville as to other material in his posses- sion elicited the reply from Lionel Sackville West that Lord Sackville knew of "no other papers at Knole relating to the colony of Virginia than those mentioned in the report of the commissioners." It may be, however, that a more careful calendar of this collection will disclose papers of great importance. From March 14, 1616, to January 11, 1620, Thomas Coventry was solicitor- general; later, during the Sandys-Southampton administration of the Virginia Company, he held the position of attorney-general. On November 1, 1625, he became lord keeper, and remained in that office during the period coinciding with the organization of the colonial administration. Hence it was that, when it was found from the report of the Manuscripts Commission that many of Lord Keeper Coventry's papers had not been investigated, the Editor addressed a letter to the Earl of Coventry, Croome Court. This resulted in a confirmation of the statement, and a promise to search the papers which are now in the "strong room here." In a letter to Ambassador Choate, July 27, 1904, the Earl of Cov- entry made the following statement: "In company with a son I went through the boxes containing papers of the Lord Keeper Coventry in which I thought it likely I might find the documents referring to the Virginia Company of London, some time ago, but I could discover nothing relating to the company." The letter goes on to say that the "papers are in bad condition and very difficult to decipher." Hence the conclusion may be reached that this most likely hiding place for Virginia records is not to reveal new material. The collections at Thirlestaine House, Cheltenham, and at Hatfield House, are extremely valuable, but T. Fitzroy Fenwick, esq., the present owner of the former, states that there is no material in that collection relating to the early history of Virginia, and a manuscript catalogue, kindly loaned to the writer by Lord Salisbury, indicates that the papers at Hatfield House, now being calendared, have no bearing on the subject in hand. By tracing the family connections of the descendants of Sir Thomas Smythe and the Earl of Southampton intermarriages are found which might result in the location of valuable papers in many of the large depositories. All of these have been investigated by the Manuscripts Commission. Thus, from Sir Thomas Smythe the documents might have been inherited by the first or the second Earl of Leicester; by Sir Sydney Stafford Smythe, baron of the exchequer in 1772 and last of the descendants of the male line; by the eighth Viscount Strangford, vice-president of the Royal Geographical Society, with whose death in 1869 the senior branch of the family was terminated; and by the present Duke of Marlborough through the second marriage of Lady Dorothy Sydney Smythe, daughter of Robert, second Earl of Leicester. The Wriothesley family is to-day represented in the houses of the Duke of Bedford and of the Duke of Portland, the former having inherited the London property of Robert, third Earl of Southampton, and the latter the Tichfield estate. The large number of documents among the Smyth of Nibley papersa a Ante, p. 55. suggests that in private collections may be many records which concern the private enterprises or companies formed within the corporation for setting out plantations and carrying on trade. Other groups of manuscripts and early books have seemed to offer opportunities for the discovery of the missing records. But the Lambeth Palace Library, the college libraries both of Oxford and of Cambridge have proved value- less, with the exception of that most important group in Magdelene College, Cambridge. Every one of the college libraries, has been searched or investigated, but to no avail. All Souls College, Oxford, contains a collection of manuscripts which may afford a few papers on the subject when it has been more carefully catalogued. The fact that the original records of the company before 1619, and a compara- tively small portion after that date have not been discovered has led generally to the conclusion that the party of the Crown destroyed the evidences of the misman- agement during the first decade and of the comparatively prosperous condition in the second. That they failed to take into account the records in the colony and the Ferrar transcripts of the court book is the good fortune of posterity. But the destruction of the records can not properly be considered as proved until the public collections have been more carefully calendared and the private collections have been more thoroughly investigated. The absolute lack of evidence that the Crown and its supporters held such an attitude and the knowledge that the commissioners took the records into their charge "for use" encourages the hope that a faithful endeavor to discover their location may yet be rewarded by success.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LIST OF RECORDS List of Records THE VIRGINIA COMPANY OF LONDON EXPLANATORY NOTE This list includes all documents, letters, publications, or other records of the Virginia Company, or relating to the company between 1616 and 1625, which the Editor has been able to discover, and also those previous to 1616 which are not published or cited by Alexander Brown in the Genesis of the United States. The object in compiling the list has been to give to the student of history the necessary information concerning each document in as convenient form as possible in order to aid him in finding or in identifying the papers. The documents have been arranged in chronological order, but with the provision that whenever the day of the month is uncertain the document has been placed at the beginning of the month, and when the month is not known it has been placed at the beginning of the year. Thus, at the first of each year and of each month will be found the undated papers, or those to which it has been impossible to assign dates. The subject-matter, as well as the title and the name of the author has been given rather for identification than to serve as a calendar, since it is the aim of this series to publish all material except that which is purely supplementary. The documents which it is intended to publish in this series, if the privilege can be secured, have been indicated by an asterisk. The title has been quoted wherever possible, and the orthography of proper names has been made to conform to that of the document. The location, indicated by abbreviated forms, and the reference, following the abbreviation, Ref., of every edition, contemporary copy, or later transcript has been given, but the description of the document is either in the introduction or will be found in connection with its publication in the succeeding volumes. Wherever the paper has been published or calendared the reference has been cited after the abbreviation, Pub. The material has been classi- fied with regard to source or authorship and the classes have been indicated by Roman numerals, placed to the left of the "reference." The bibliographies have been included in the index in the second volume of the series. It has been found necessary either to abbreviate or to use symbols for the names of the libraries or collections in which documents are found, and those abbreviations have been placed at the extreme right hand of the page.

This Quarter Court according to the L?es Pattents being chiefly ordayned for the elec?on of Officers: Mr T?er desired the Court that before he left his place, he might acquaynt them wth two messages Lately re? from the King: The one was, that he receaued a ?re from mr Secretarie Caluert that his Matie had sent a man vp suspected for Deere stealing, to be transported for Virginia; and vnderstanding that Mr Iohn fferrar had a shipp shortly to goe thither, ? desired ? that his Mats resolu?on might be fulfilled therein. The other was, that this morning there came a messenger of the Chamber to vnder- stand of the welfare of the Plantation, his Maty hauing heard that a Shipp was come from thence: And so desired the Court to proceed to the choice of their Officers, signifying that for these Twelue yeares he hath willingly spent his Labors and endeauors for the support thereof: and being now appointed by the Kinge a Comissioner of his Nauie he could not giue such good attend- ance as he therein desired. Requesting the Court to shewe him so much fauor as now ? to ? dispence with him, and to elect [2] some worthy man in his place, for he had resolued to relinquish it, and therefore desired that two requests might be graunted him for all his service done vnto them. ffirst that he may ? might ? haue their good report according as he hath deserued: And secondly that his account might be wth all speed audited, that before he dyes, he might see the same cleered, and receiue his Quietus est vnder the Companies seale. Wch the Cort finding his resolu?on to be settled, and that he would not stand in elec?on; they proceeded according to the Last Standing order now read, to make choice of their Treasuror Sr Edwin Sandis, Sr Iohn Wolstenholme and mr Ald?an Iohnson being nomi- nated and accordingly ballated, the Lott fell to Sr Edwin Sandis to be T?er, he hauing 59 balls, Sir Io: Wolstenholme: 23: and Ald?an Iohnson: 18: wherevpon his oath was administred.2 2 For documents relating to this election see List of Records, Nos. 108 and 170, pages 133 and 140, ante.

T?er that for as much as there hath beene heretofore two seuerall Comittees appointed by the Court; The first for making of Orders for the Company, &amp; for matter of Graunts and Pattents of Land; And [4] the other for the setting downe the duty of euery perticuler Office, that therefore whither they thought it not expedient, that there should be a third Comittee appointed to take the labors of both the former Comittees into considera?on, who by adding them together, and supplying what may seeme defectiue, may reduce them into one entire body to be presented to the next Quarter Court for confirma?on if they shall see cause. Wch Proposi?on the Court haue condiscended vnto, and to that end haue desired Sr Dudley Diggs. Sr Iohn Wolstenholme. Sr Edward Harwood. mr Alde? Iohnson &amp; Sr Nath: Rich. mr Iohn Wroth. to meete vpon ffriday seavenight being the 21th of this instant at Sr Edwin Sandis howse at seauen of the Clock in the morning. Mr. Treasurors second Proposi?on was, that there might be another Comittee for the constituting of Lawes and setling of a forme of Gov- ernemt ouer all Virginia, appointing Magistrates and Officers there- vnto, and expressing their seuerall dueties: wch the Court generally did very well approue of and haue nominated the former Comittee, and licenced any of the Counsell to repair vnto them, and to haue their voice, and haue added of the Company to be assisting Sr Thomas Wroth, mr Thomas Gibbs, mr Dr Gulson, Captaine Bingham, mr Wm Essington, mr Edward Ditchfield, mr Thomas Kightley, mr Wm Caninge, mr Henry Briggs and mr. Thomas Wheatley to meet at the same time and place vpon ffriday ffourtenight being the 28th of this instant. Mr. Th?er intimated to the Court, that whereas Sr Thomas Smith at the resigning vp his place should report that there was —4000li for the new Treasuror to enter vpon, he now signified that it was true if the Lotteries were dissolued and the account giuen vp: but in the interim there resteth but One thousand poundes in Cash the rest in Stock remayning in the hands of him that hath the managing of the busines, and out of this there is debts to pay, and wch shortly wilbe due to pay the some of—3700li—v?ztt old poun debts of Ten yeares old 1800li— and att the returne of the Shipps Sr Geo: Yeardley went in, and the other wherein the Children was transported will amount to—1148li— as also 700li—wch is owing to the Collec?on mony, wch by warrant hath beene yssued out for the vse of the Company; And therefore it was putt to the question whither the Stock remayning should goe or not to the payment of the Companies debts, wch was by erec?on of hand? allowed that it should. And further agreed that the remaynder should be employed either in sending men to the Publique Land to rayse benefitt that wayes or in transporting of Cattle, wch hereafter may seeme fittest. And forasmuch as there is now remayning in the hands of Gabriell Barbor much old plate wch if the Lottaries were finished, the Com- pany thereby should sustayne great Losse: It was therefore now ordered (vnlesse some can giue iust informa?on of any perticu- ler abuse) that the same shall continue to be drawne out till the last of Nouember next ensuing &amp; then to cease and determine. [5] And forasmuch as Sr Thos. Smith is very importunate for the speedy auditing of his Acco and to that end hath desired some others to be associated vnto the Auditors namely, mr Morris Abbott, mr Humph: Handford, and mr Anthony Abdy: It is therefore ordered, that if he so please these three shalbe annexed vnto them, either as Auditors or as assistants to see the passage of the busines, that Sr Thomas Smith haue noe wrong: but if it be his pleasure to allowe of them to be Auditors, then the next Quarter Court they to take their Oaths for the preventing of all partiallity, and mr Thomas Keightly is also chosen to be associated to the Auditors and to take his oath. And in asmuch as the great paines allready spent by the Auditors hath gayned to them selues a more perfect vnderstanding than those wch shall newly enter cann be capable of. Therefore it was moued that Three of the old Auditors might be of the Coram, and that nothing should be concluded wthout two at least of their consents; Wch Proposi?on was well allowed, and mr. Th?er, Sr Io: Dãuers and mr. Wroth being thereto nominated, and put to the question, it was by erec?on of hand? confirmed. Captaine Brewster hauing formerly by way of appeale deliuered vnto the Court a certaine writing touching the proceedings of Captaine Samuell Argoll against him at the arriual of the Neptune in Virginia, and the manner of his tryall, and being at this Court ready to mayn- tayne the same, and to obiect other grievances against him, he was wished rather to forbeare till the said Captaine Argoll were prsent: and in the interim haue thought it convenient to deliuer vnto the said Captaine Argoll a coppy of the said writing of Appeale to make answere vnto the same, and haue appointed him to put in his other Articles vpon ffriday morning next to mr Th?er and mr Deputy to be by them pervsed and deliuered into the next Cort, and the next Quarter Court to heare the Appeale. Lieftenant Stokes made request vnto the Court, that they would please in reguard of the Adventure of his person and his Long time spent in Virginia to bestowe some Land vpon him there for the same; wch they found to be now noe convenient time for that purpose; but if at ye next Qr Court he procure it to be moued for him, that Court will take thereof due considera?on.</field>

The busines formerly putt to arbitrement, and referred by the Com- pany and the Lady Lawarre vnto mr.

The Last Court wherein mr Th?er was desired to repaire to mr Atturny Generall to learne the Contents of a Pattent wch should be graunted [7] to one Sumerscales about Tobacco. He now acquaynted them that he had performed that trust, and findeth it to be very preiudiciall to this Company, if the same should passe therefore advised that there might forthwth be a course taken for to prevent and stopp the proceeding of it: wch being taken into considera?on, the Court haue desired mr T?er to goe againe to mr Atturney Generall and to take some more paines for to hinder the going forward of the same, and haue associated to goe along wth him Generall Cecill, Sr Io: Wolstenholme, mr Alde? Iohnson and mr Iohn Wroth to morrowe morning at seauen of the Clock, and if they faile of doing good therein, it is agreed, that the Counsell shalbe assembled to take such further course therein as shall seeme requisite mr Wm Palmer was desired to write to mr Sumerscales to meete them at that hower at mr Atturnies. It was also by mr T?er propounded to the Cort as a thing most worthy to be taken into considera?on both for the glory of God, and honor of the Company, that forasmuch as the King in his most gracious fauor hath graunted his ?res to the seuerall Bishops of this Kingdome for the collecting of monies to erect and build a Colledge in Virginia for the trayning and bringing vp of Infidells children to the true knowl- edge of God &amp; vnderstanding of righteousnes. And considering what publique notice may be taken in foreslowing to sett forward the ac?on, especially of all those wch hath contributed to the same, that therefore to begin that pious worke, there is allready towards it —1500li,—or thereabouts, whereof remayning in cash 800li, the rest is to be answered out of the Stock of the Generall Company for so much wch they borrowed, besides the likelihood of more to come in; ffor mr Treasuror hauing some conference wth the Bishop of Lichfield, he hath not heard of any Collec?on that hath beene for that busines in his Diocese; but promiseth when he hath a warrt therevnto he will wth all dilligence further the enterprize; Wherevpon he conceaued it the best fittest; that as yet they should not build the Colledge, but rather forbeare a while; and begin first with the meanes they haue to provide and settle an Annuall revennue, and out of that to begin the erec?on of the said Colledge: And for the performance hereof also moued, that a certaine peece of Land be Laid out at Henrico being the place formerly resolued of wch should be called the Colledge Land, and for the planting of the same send presently ffifty good persons to be seated thereon and to occupy the same according to order, and to ?haue? halfe the benefitt of their Labor and the other halfe to goe in setting forward the worke, and for mayntenance of the Tutors &amp; Schollers. He therefore propounded that a Shipp might be prouided against the begining of August, to carry those ffifty men wth their prouisions, as also to send ffiftie persons more to the Co?on Land wch may raise a Stock for the paying of dueties there and defraying the Companies charge here, and to send provision of victualls wth them for a yeare: And for the defraying the charge hereof did also propound the meanes; first for the Colledge there was mony in Cash, and besides it may saue the Ioint stock the sending out a Shipp this yeare, wch for 4d a pound they will bring from thence all their Tobacco wch may arise to ffive hundreth pound? besides mony that may come in otherwise to [8] helpe to beare the charge of the voyage; Wch Proposi?on was well liked but the time and season not allowed of all; and by some obiected, that the Generall Planta?on should receaue much mony if more men were sent ouer soe sodaynly before those that are allready gone haue procured wherewthall to subsist; as also being a matter of greate consequence it did more propperly belong to the deciding of a Quarter Cort: but the former reasons being answered; and being further alleaged if it were till then prolonged the time would be past for their provisions of beefe, beere, and meate. Wherevpon after Long arguing and disputing thereof it was agreed to be putt to the question; Wch being propounded whether a shipp should be sett out to carry men for these two good vses and be sett out at the publique charge—(vizt) wth 50 Passengers for the Colledge Land, and 50 for the Co?on Land, it was by generall consent, and erec?on of hand? allowed and confirmed. One mr Weyncop comended to the Company by the Earle of Lincolne intending to goe in person to Virginia, and there to plant himselfe and his Associats presented his Pattent now to the Cort; wch was referred to the Comittee that meeteth vpon ffriday morning at mr Treasurors howse to consider and if need be to correct the same.</field>

And secondly that by reason of his extraordinary busines, dishabillity in body, and he because he would be ready to answere to any difficulty, requested, that the Audite might be kept at his howse, and to goe forward wth the Acco of the Cashe, wch he onely is ingaged for and noe other; And what damage appeareth hath beene done to the Company by such Officers as he trusted he will satisfy to the vttmost: But vpon profes- sion that the said lawe was not to preiudice or debarr Sr Thomas Smith from the benefitt of the said old Accompte, they were agreed to be putt to the question: Wch being done, they were generally con- firmed by erec?on of hand?.

Wch was answered by Sr Thomas Smith, that others might be found to haue as much experience in Accounts, as he, and be more fitter in reguard of his greate busines: Yet notwthstanding to determine this Controuersy, he would referr him- selfe to the most voic? of the Auditors, whither they would be willing to meete at his house or not.

Captayne Brewsters appeale against Captaine Samuell Argoll touch- ing his condempna?on in Virginia being referred to the hearing of this Court; and now questioned by the said Captaine Brewster whither he were Gouernor or noe, imagining that at their Landing he had receaued his writt of discharge; and if it were so whether he dealt iustly, proceeding as he did against him in Marshall Lawe, being onely in case of muteny and rebellion that the same should be executed. Touching the point whither he were Gouernor or noe, it plainly appeared by a ?re sent vnto him (wch the said Captaine Argoll now produced) signed by some of the Counsell and Company, that at the Landing of the Lo: Lawarr in Virginia, he should surrender vp his place; Wch seeing it pleased god to take his ?ops Life from his mortall body before he Landed there, this point stood cleere that he remayned Gouernor, in statu quo prius. ffor the other point whether iustice were executed in performing his tryall by Marshall Lawe, because the Court found it more convenient for the busines to be more priuately handled, it was ordered, that the Counsell should be summoned to meete to morrow morning at my Lo: of Warwickes house at eight of the Clock there to decide the business and report to the Court. This Court taking into considera?on the worthynes of some Noblemen and others now present by giuing their dilligent attendance from time to time to the benefitt and furtherance of the Planta?on, as namely the Right honoble Robt Earle of Warwick, Sr Tho: Cheeke, Sr Nath: Rich, mr John fferrar deputy and Captaine Nath: Butler haue now [12] made choice of them to be of his Mats Counsell for Virginia, and each of them being putt to the question was generally ratified by erec?on of hand?, and are appointed to ?attend? my Lo: Chamberlaine for the taking of their Oaths. The request of diuers of the Generallity to the T?er, Counsell and Company of Virginia being presented at this Court, touching the reforming and rectifying of the Magazine busines, was vpon pervsall allowed of, and being putt to the question ratified by erec?on of hand?; Wch points are these that followe, 1.Whereas the Director of the Magazine his Assistants and other Officers haue vpon the first elec?on continued now in their places two yeares and vpwards, They desire, that according to the vse of the Officers for the Company they may be chosen anew euery yeare, or that the former may be continued in their places by a new elec?on yearely. 2.Whereas the Officers of the Magazine haue promised out of the good? returned from Virginia to make a Devision of one Capitall vnto the Adventurers in Aprill last, and haue not yet performed it, nor made vp any Accounts to giue the Adventurers satisfac?on, They desire that they may be required by the Court to performe their promise imediately, and to make vp their Account? against the next Court day and then present them to the Court; And that the Adventurers may then proceed to a new elec?on. 3.Thirdly that the Officers of the Magazine as well those that are now, as those that shalbe hereafter may take their Oaths for their iust dealing, and trew accompting wch the Company, aswell as the Officers of the Generall Company who handle not so greate so?es. 4.That all the letters written from the officers of the Magazine to the Capemerchant, and from the Capemerchant to them may be entred in a booke by their Secretary, to the end that all men may be satisfied of faire dealings and proceedings. 5.That the Assembly for the Magazine may be kept when &amp; where the Courts are to the end the Adventurers may come and speake their mindes more freely, soe farr forth as they shall haue reason. fforasmuch as it appeared, that there was more busines to be per- formed then this Afternoone could well determine; It was moued that if mr Th?er hereafter shall finde the like, that then he may please to giue order for the Company to meete both fforenoone &amp; After- noone, wch was referred to be considered of by the Comittee for the Standing orders. By reason it grewe late, and the Court ready to breake vp, and as yet mr Iohn Whincops Pattent for him and his Asso- ciats being to be read, it was ordered that the seale should be annexed vnto it, and haue referred the trust thereof vnto the Auditors to examine that it agree wth the Originall; wch if it doth not, they haue promised to bring it into the Court &amp; cancell it. [13] A former Comittee appointed concerning Captaine Bargraues busi- nes, the matter being found difficult, and the time short, The Court vpon another peti?on preferred by Capt Bargraue haue adioyned vnto them Generall Cæsill, Sr Dudley Diggs, Sr Tho: Cheeke, Sr Iohn Dãuers, Sr Nath: Rich to meete at Generall Cæsills howse to morrowe Afternoone at two of the Clock; And that Mr Ald?an Iohnson, mr Essington &amp; mr Ditchfield be warned to be there at that time.</field>

The Guift being now returned from Virginia and hauing brought ?res from Sr George Yeardley directed to Sr Edw: Sandis intimating the sore voyage they had; being going thither from the 19th of Ianuary to the 19th of Aprill following, In wch time there dyed 14 Landmen and three seamen as also that two children was borne at sea, &amp; dyed, and at his there ariuall finding the Planta?on to be in great scarsity for want of Corne, desired the Company to beare wth him, if ?for? this yeare he some thing neglected the planting of Tobacco, and followe the sowing of Corne, where by the next yeare he hopes by the blessing of God to raise such a Cropp thereof, that the said Planta?on shall haue noe greate cause to complaine in hast of want. Other priuate busines mr Th?er acquaynted the Court was specified in his ?res, wch is first to receaue the advise of the Counsell, and by their direc?ons to reveale it to the Court.1 1 This is probably the letter given in List of Records, No. 93, page 131, ante. It was moued by mr Th?er, that the Generall Comittees should forth- with meete for the setting out this shipp, and furnishing of her wth good people to be sent to the Colledge and publique Land, wch hitherto by defect thereof, the Planta?on hath beene much wronged: wch [14] if the Court would put them in trust for the prouiding of such, they would intreate the Gentlemen both of Country and Citty to helpe them therewith. Wch mo?on the Court comended and haue desired mr Th?ers assistance therein. The Counsell hauing mett according to order from the Last Court; touching the appeal of Captaine Brewster against Captaine Samuell Argoll, the Court hauing cleered one point concerning his Gouernor- shipp, and the Counsell now approuing of the other for his tryall by Marshall Lawe, holding Captaine Argoll not faulty therein, by reason he proceeded and followed the example of his Predecessors, and the Custome altogether vsed hetherto in that Planta?on, wch is likely to continue till the standing orders for Virginia be made and enacted; and he being tryed by a Marshall Court, the Counsell held it to be the Noblest tryall being iudged by Souldiers and men of worth. But forasmuch as it is obiected that the said Captaine Argoll proceeded vnduely, Capt Brewster comitting noe crime worthy of death, and being also alleaged that he was first condempned and afterward called vnto his Answere, wch the Counsell and Court here cann not iudge of, but is to be tryed there, where the euidence may be giuen; It was therefore now ordered, that the said Appeale and Captaine Argolls answere therevnto shalbe sent inclozed wthin a ?re of the Companies to Sr George Yeardley and the Counsell of State, and they to make examina?on of the cause and returne Certificate thereof. An oath was also exhibited by Captaine Brewster, wch was administred vnto him in Virginia, wch is also agreed to be sent for informa?on of the truth thereof. The Comittee by the Court appointed vpon the peti?on of Captaine Bargraue, touching the suite depending in Chauncery betwixt him and some Adventurers of the Magazine, the same Comittee meeting at the time and place appointed, and considering thereof hauing both bill and answere, and the booke of the Orders of Courts, who pervsing the same, and finding that Capt. Bargraue had 14 dayes respite for giuing security to the Adventurers, and wth in six dayes the bargaine was taken of his handes, for wch he was to allowe vnto the Adventurers, —150li wth a promise that if it were sold for aboue ffiue shillings a pound, he should haue the Ouerplus: but being all sold by some of the Ad- venturers of the Magazine amongst themselues wth in two dayes after at— iiijs ixd it was conceaued by the said Comittee, that the said Capt Bargraue had much wrong offered therein: and therefore did see noe reason why the Company should countenance this busines, but leaue the Defendts to followe it; or to take the matter vp amongst themselues. Wherevpon after some debating, being putt to the question whither the Virginia Company should ioyne or noe in suite against Capt Bar- graue wth the Defendants, It was agreed by erec?on of hand? that not- wthstanding any order to the contrary, the said Company should neither ioyne nor assist the said Defendants herein. And that vpon Wedens- day sevenight, when the said Adventurers of the Magazine doe meete, it be putt vnto them to see likewise if they will vndertake the same. [15] It was agreed that Mr Ald?an Iohnson, and the rest of the Adventurers and Officers of the Magazine should be warned agaynst Wedensday sevenight to meete at mr fferrars howse. and to haue the Acco ready to be deliuered in vpon their Oath. It was moued by mr. Th?er that the Court would take into considera- ?on to appoint a Comittie of choice Gentlemen, and other of his Mats Counsell for Virginia concerning the Colledge; being a waighty busi- nes, and so greate, that an Account of their proceedings therein must be giuen to the State. Vpon §wch§ the Cort vpon deliberate considera?on haue reco?ended the care thereof vnto the Right wor Sr Dudley Diggs, Sr Iohn Dãuers, Sr Nath: Rich, Sr Io: Wolstenholme, mr Deputy fferrar, mr Dr Anthony, and mr Dr Gulson to meete at such time as mr Treasuror shall giue order therevnto. fforasmuch as the standing Lawes and orders concerning the governe- ment of Virginia being finished by the Comittee to whome they were recomended, and passed the seuerall Ceremonies according to the orders of the Company, It was moued that the second Comittee for the setling of Lawes &amp; Magistracie might be summoned by the Officer to meete at Sr Edwin Sandis his howse vpon ffriday morning next at eight of the Clock, and there to devide the busines amongst themselues as they shall see cause: Wch the Court thought very con- venient, and haue allowed thereof. Also vpon a mo?on of the Susans voyage to be audited, and the com- plaint of the Generallity in some abuse offred by the Ioint stock to be rectified; The ordinary Auditors are warned to meete therevpon vpon Munday morning at eight of the Clock at mr Treasurors howse. It was agreed vpon the mo?on of Sr Dudley Diggs and Sr Thomas Gates vnto the Court about a Pattent to be graunted vnto sundry Kentishmen, who would seate and plant themselues in Virginia, that they should haue as Large priuiledges and imunities as is graunted to any other in that kinde. Vpon the peti?on of Iohn Woodliefe gentleman (who disbursed 62—10—00 eleauen yeares since, and the like time spent in the Planta- ?on in the place of Ensigne[) ] to haue a Pattent graunted him and his Associats whereon to plant the nomber of 200 persons to be trans- ported into Virginia before the end of Six yeares next Coming, and to haue the like priviledges to him and his Associats, in lieu aswell of his said Adventure and personall allowance, as for other his Associats who haue adventured of old: Wch the Court hath now graunted vnto him. [16] Whereas vpon a former order, it was agreed to pay interest for a some of mony in the Companies hand? during the minority of one Katha- rine Bath to whome the mony doth belong. The Court vpon better considera?on now finding it not convenient to pay Interest haue agreed to reverse the said order &amp; to ?pay? the mony where it is due. The Court being acquaynted of one mr Robert Browne who adven- tured wth the Lo: Lawarr 25li and went himselfe in person to Virginia, and there dyed, haue now agreed wth the consent and liking of the Lady Lawarr that the [said 25li]1 1 The manuscript is blotted so as to make this and the two following doubtful passages almost illegible. shalbe deducted out of the 500li adven- ture of my Lord?, and so [that * * * * r]2 2 Probably power or order. be giuen to the Bookeeper for the defaulking of it out of the said 500li adventure, &amp; passing it to the said Robert Browne by a bill [of A]dventure in his owne name. And moreouer haue agreed that for his personall Adventure he shall (according to the orders of the Company) haue 100 Acres of Land.</field>

And inasmuch as mr Iohn Wroth is conceaued by some error to be left out, he is therefore now desired to be an Assist- ant vnto them and to giue them meeting at such time &amp; place as is agreed of. The Comittee for ?the? setling of lawes and Magistracie in Virginia haue mett as they were desired and vpon examina?on haue found diuers Lawes in the ?res Pattents and good poynts in the Instruc?ons giuen by his Maty vnder the Privy Seals wch wilbe a greate further- ance for the setling of the busines, purposing to take such paynes therein as to present them to the next Quarter Court and to that end (because [18] most in this Vacation time resolueth to goe into the country) haue devided it amongst them selues for the better preparing of it against their next meeting. It was moued by mr.

Also he moued that in reguard of great somes wch is presently to be issued out vpon this voyage, and the extraordinary busines wch the Company from time to time imposeth vpon him, that a perticuler Th?er might be appointed vnder him for the issuing out thereof, wch he [should] not deliuer wthout a warrant, nor the other should pay it forth wthout the like authority of a warrant to be giuen vnto him: Wch the Court haue thought fitt, because he stands engaged for it, to referr it vnto himselfe, who therein hath made choice of mr Deputy fferrar. Stephen Sparrowes request for the personall adventures of ffower servants wch he sent to Virginia is referred to the Auditors vpon Munday morning. William Shackley of London Haberdasher assigned to Oliuer St Iohn Two shares in Virginia.

A controuersy arising amongst the Adventurers of the Magazine for their place of meeting, it being made knowne that mr Ald?an Iohnson who is the Director thereof, desired it might be at Sr Tho: Smiths, by reason he was one of the greatest and principall Adventurers and not well able to goe to any other place: but forasmuch as there is a standing order, that so long as the generall Company hath an Adven- ture in any Ioint stock, their meetings shalbe where the Generall Corts is kept: mr Th?er and Deputy insisted strongly for the mayntayning of the said Order, insomuch that it was answered that it were better a little to dispense wth that said order, then a Generall ffac?on thereby should be raysed betwixt the Company and adventurers: wch was answered by mr Th?er that he sawe no reason to feare any such ffac?on: but for his part if the Adventurers would repay to the Generall Company their Eight hundreth pound? they haue paid into the Magazine, they might meete in what place they pleased, and that might be done wthout breach of order, till then he was sworne to mayntayne the orders and lawes of the Company vnlesse they shalbe disanulled by the same wayes and meanes that they are [19] confirmed. But much dispute growing herein, and the Counsell all save o[ne] hauing deliuered their opinions to mayntayne the order, It was at length agree[d] that the said Adventurers of the Magazine should be warned to meete here vpon Munday next in the Afternoone at the Generall Cort to performe such things as in the Last Quarter Cort had beene ordered, concerning the Magazine and the officers thereof.</field>

With others. mr Chambers. Vpon reading the last order in the last Court, touching the place of meeting of the Magazine Adventurers, mr Th?er signified to the Cort, that by reason of such contrary desires to meete a part, they could haue noe meeting wth the Adventurers at all, and therefore shewed two reasons that might induce them not to fly from the standing order: One, that the Generall Company hath twice as greate an Adventure therein, as any of the greatest perticuler Adventurers: And the other, that hetherto from time to time, their meetings haue beene at the same time and place, where and when the generall Court? hath beene kept, sauing onely twice: Wch was replyed by mr Ald?an Iohnson Director of the Magazine, that it could not be soe convenient to meete together as in meeting a part; because at such meeting ? wilbe of the Generality, but if it be for the mayntayning of the Standing order, that their meetings should be both in one place; it was not unknowne, but that Sr Thomas Smith hath offred his howse for them at any time to sitt in, who being a great Adventurer was worthy to haue a voice [as] ?stet? occasion serueth amongst them; and the rather that he and some others was engaged to the Chamber of London for one thousand pound?, wch if they pleased to cleare them of that bond, he would consent to meete where they pleased. Wch was answered by mr Th?er, that one reason why they should be vndeuided, was, that from time to time they might receaue their authority from the Gen- erall Corts: and mr Ald?an well said, they were not tyed to a perticuler place of meeting, therefore he would be willing (if the Court should soe like of it) that they should meet sometimes at Sr Thomas Smiths, at such time as Sr Thomas Smith should haue occasion to desire to be present. And for the 1000li wch Sr Thomas Smith, Sr Iohn Wol- stenholme, and mr Alderman Iohnson standeth bound he held it not convenient to haue any Diuident till that were paid. Wherevpon many in the Court agreeing in opinion wth him, it was desired to be [20] putt to the question; wch being propounded, whither the Thowsand pound? should be paid, that is at interest at seauen ? Cent or that the Vndertakers should remayne in bond?, and a Diuident be made the Adventurers, by erec?on of hand? was concluded, that the said vndertakers should be released, by repaying the said some of 1000li into the Chamber of London before there should be any Divident. Next was moued by Mr Th?er the prosequuting of the Proposi?on agreed of in the Last Quarter Cort, wch was, that the Magazine should imitate the order of the Company: ffirst that Officers should be yearely chosen and sworne &amp; that §an§ a true Acc0 should be deliuered in vpon their Oaths. And first taking into considera?on the choice of their Director, it was propounded whither they would haue one or two, wch was agreed to haue but one; and mr Ald?an Iohnson being there- vnto nominated and putt to the question, was by erec?on of hand? confirmed. Likewise to be assisting to mr Director, choice is now made of fiue Comittees, viztt, mr Essington, mr Rich: Morer, mr Edward Ditchfield, mr Richard Caswell, and mr Berblock. And for Auditors mr Abraham Cartwright, Mr George Chambers, Mr Henry Briggs and mr Richard Wiseman, who are desired to be at the next Court to take their oaths: and also against that time an exact Account be giuen of the State of the Cash, &amp; what debts is owing, that (if it may be) halfe a Capitall may be deuided amongst the Adventurers. And it was also by mr Th?er desired that the 340li wch the Magazine oweth to the Generall stock may be forthwth paid, he hauing such extraordinary occasion to vse mony for the setting out the shipp agreed to be sent, and what cann be proued either by order of Cort, or otherwise to be due vnto them they shall haue it paid, and therefore when the Auditors now chosen for the Magazine shall haue seene into the Accounts, they would repaire to the Generall Auditors at his howse to conclude the differences vpon Tuesday seauennight at two of the Clock in the afternoone. And against that time did also request that they would giue themselues vnderstanding of the first Magazine sett out in the Susan, that the Generall Stock may receaue the mony due vnto them vpon that voyage, and that the Account may be cleered without further delay. Mr George Chambers in the behalfe of Martins Hundred desired the Company to make examina?on of some abuses offred to their Cor- pora?on by the Mr and Marriners of the Ship, as also to rectify some wrong done vnto them by the Capemerchant: Wherevpon the Court was pleased to call before them the Marriners, administring vnto them an Oath to answere vnto such Interrogotories as shalbe law- fully demaunded of them touching Martins Hundred: wch done the examina?on thereof was referred to two of the Counsell and two of the Company, viztt, to mr Ald?an Iohnson, mr Morrice Abbott, &amp; mr Abdy and mr Cartwright. And for wrong donne by the Capemerchant, it being not their case alone that complaynes, It was agreed that a ?re should be written from the Counsell to Sr George Yeardley, and that Mr Chambers and others [23]1 1 Pages 21 and 22 are missing from the manuscript. The catch word at the end of page 20 is "deliuer." findeth none soe fitt and convenient for them as mr Deputy fferrars, if it pleased him to let the Company haue her, there being Cabbins and euery thing in a readines. But inasmuch as a Publique impu- ta?on was Laid vpon him in the disputing of men to be sent to the Colledge Land, in saying that he had some priuate end? in solliciting it soe hard; he therefore desired to be excused, and that they would prouide some other, Least in performing their desire he should drawe some malignity therein vpon himselfe: but being vrged therevnto by the Cort, who generally cleering him of that imputa?on he hath (through the good he wisheth vnto the Company) condiscended to their request, and referred it to the Comittees to allowe him for ffraight what they shall thinke good.</field>

The Magazine Shipp being returned from Virginia, and a Packett of wrightings receaued from Abraham Persey the Capemerchant, but not any ?re yet receaued from Sr George Yeardley the Gouernor, the same was now presented to this Court, where in the Packett was conteyned a generall ?re to the Adventurers, an Invoice of the good? now come home, a bill of Lading, a certificate of the misdemeanor of one Showell who was sent to assist the Capemercht, a note of such good? as the Country standeth in need of, an Invoice of the good? Wth was Landed by the George 1617, An account of the same goods, two bills of Exc? to Sr Iohn Wolstenholme, and a note of mony Wch the Marriners oweth to the said Adventurers. The Generall ?re being now read, It was moued by mr Th?er, that 2 point? especially therein might be taken into considera?on; 1.Whither it be convenient that libertie be giuen to the Capemer- chant according as he desireth to barter and sell the Comodities as he cann and as is vsuall in free trading: As also liberty to the Inhab- itants there to barter and sell their comodities. 2.That as he writeth he is ouercharged wth aboundance of needles Comodities, and wanteth Ploughes and other necessaries, wch he hath often writt for, that it may be thought of how to be remedyed. [24] To wch purpose, the Court haue now appointed ffower of the Counsell, 2 of Smiths Hundred and 2 of Martins Hundred, viztt of the Counsell Sr Tho: Gates, mr Iohn Wroth, mr Deputy fferrar and Capt Argoll; ffor Smiths Hundred, mr Thomas Gibbs and mr Robt Smith; ffor Martins Hundreth, mr Geo: Chambers, and mr Wm Caninge, who together wth the Director and Comittees for the Magazine are desired to meete too morrow in the Afternoone at mr Treasurrs howse to con- sider of these Two points, &amp; to pervse the writings, that care may be taken to redresse what is amisse. Next according to an order made in the Last Court, mr Th?er required of the Officers then chosen for the Magazine, such Acco as was then comitted to their care to be perfected, and brought in as vpon this day at the furthest: but perceauing that mr Essington was gone and that noe Account could be presented, being some thing moued that from time to time they should be putt of and could haue neither paid the money wch appeareth to be due to the Company, nor that they would meete to audite the same, addressed himselfe to mr Alderman Iohnson as Director thereof, saying, he would complaine to the Lord? of the Counsell of it, or comence suite against him. Wherevpon mr Alderman conceauing as he afterward? said he had threatned him in his owne person, replied, that he durst not, wth some other angry word? he then vttered; wch some of the Counsell tooke excep?ons at, saying, the Court was very much wronged by it, and that if it were suffered to haue the Treasuror so vsed, there would be noe respect given vnto him, to wch the Court consented: And mr Th?er for his part affirmed, that he did not meane mr Alderman otherwise then as ?he was? Director of the Magazine, &amp; when he spoke of himselfe he meant the Virginia Company: Which being putt to the question, whither the Court vnderstood that he spoke perticulerly of his person, or of the Adventurers of the Magazine, it was by most voices affirmed, that they vnderstood in speaking to him, that he ment of the Maga- zine Company: And because it should not passe wthout some reproofe or acknowledgmt of his part of an error, for preventing the like here- after soe neere as may be; It was moued by mr Wm Caninge, that the Cort might presently decide it; and afterward vpon putting the ques- tion, by generall erec?on of hand? agreed that the Counsell now present being the Ea: of Warwicke, Sr Thomas Gates, Sr Iohn Dãuers, Sr Nath: Riche, mr Iohn Wroth and mr Deputy fferrar should meete too morrow morning at my Lo: of Southamptons, and they together wth his Lõp to consider of mr Aldermans words and to censure him accordingly.

There was also presented to the Court by the Auditors and there openly read this writing ensuing; Whereas it hath appeared plainly that during the time, that mr Alderman Iohnson was both Deputy of the Company and Director of the Magazine diuers great somes haue beene wrongfully converted from the Cashe of the Company § to § the vse and Cashe of the Magazine, as namely the some of ? 341 ? 13 ? 4 ? of the Companies money was in May—1617—converted to the buying of good? for the Magazine wch were sent in the George, and receiued by the Capemer- chant, and returned in his Acco wth the gaine of—85—8—4—And moreouer in October–1618–the Companies Tobacco growing in their Co?on garden was sold to mr Abraham Chamberlaine for One hundreth three score and sixteene pound?; and that so?e paid into the Cash of the Magazine. And whereas also there are diuers reciprocall demaunds made both by the Company and the Magazine for persons and goodes interchangeably transported by each for other: Wch Account wee the Auditors for the Company haue beene on or parts att all times desirous and ready to audite; but haue found noe corre- spondency nor disposition to the same in the Officers for the Magazine, notwth- standing or often requests and diuers orders of Courts, wch they haue neglected and broken and doe soe still persist: fforasmuch as it is very apparent vnto vs, that there is a great some of money of right due to be paid by the Magazine to the Company, wthout wch there is noe meanes for the setting out of this shipp now prepared for the transporting of One hundreth men for Generall service: And wee haue done or vtmost endeauor therein wch hath proued fruitles: Wec are inforced according to the duty of or places to present the considera?on hereof to yor wisdomes, that some further course may be taken for doing right to the Company, and advancing the Co?on service thereon depending.

[27] This being deliuered by the Auditors, and wth all the Acco betweene the Company and Adventurers, which by the helpe of the Courtbooke (hauing examined it thorough) they haue finished; there onely rest- eth for the Court to decide, that if they will allowe of sundry trans- porta?ons of men, by former orders in the said booke not men?oned, that then there wilbe One hundreth pound? lesse for the Company to receaue: But it growing late it was agreed, and that the Shipp should be noe longer stayde, that mr Th?er should make vse of the Three hundreth pound? due vnto the Magazine by the Adventurers of Smiths hundred, and that the Account betweene them shalbe forthwth audited: To wch purpose my Lord of Southampton hath promised his assistance vpon ffriday morning next at Sir Thomas Smiths howse, at wch time mr Alderman, together wth mr Essington, mr Abraham Chamberlaine, mr Richard Moorer and mr Berblock, are appointed to ioyne wth the Auditors of the Company and so to decide the Controuersy. fforasmuch as the Collector for Tobacco refuseth to deliuer the Tobacco now come home, vnlesse the Company will pay twelue pence custome vpon euery pound weight, wch is double aboue the booke of rates, the same being but six pence, and also being freed by his Mats ?res Pat- tents of Impost and Custome sauing 5 ? Cent: It is now agreed, that a Peti?on shalbe drawne to the Lord? Comissioners of the Treasury, and haue desired my Lo: of Warwicke, Sr Nath: Riche, mr Ald?an Iohnson and mr Brooke to attend their ?ops vpon ffriday next in the Afternoone for the cleering of the same. It was moued by mr T?er, that in reguard the time of the yeare pass- eth away, and most of the Company retireth themselues into the Country, and as yet a great deale of busines is to be performed before the departure of the Shipp, that a Comittee might be appointed to meete euery day for the dispatch of the same, and that the Generall Courts be dissolued till Michaelmas terme, vnlesse there be an extraor- dinary occasion, that mr Th?er or mr Deputy call an extraordinary Court; Which being approued of by the Court, there were nominated Sr Iohn Dãuers, mr Deputy, mr Alderman Iohnson, mr Iohn Wroth, mr Tho: Gibbs, mr Geo: Thorpe, mr Cranmer and mr Chambers to meete at mr T?ers for dispatch of those businesses. Mr Deputy acquaynting this Court, that the Comittees hauing mett, and devided the busines amongst themselues for the speedier sending away of this shipp; in wch as some of them are to be [28] comended by performing the charge comitted to their trust; so there are some to whome the care of buying apparrell was comitted, whoe part of them being out of Towne, the rest haue failed therein; in whose steed? he desires, that some other might be appointed to per- forme that trust; to wch by the Court is appointed mr Cranmer, mr Bull and Thomas Mellinge. All such Bills of Exchange as were now sent from Abraham Persey the Capemerchant concerning the Magazine amounting to Eighte hundreth pound? specified in his Letters, is by the Adventurers thereof this present day accepted to be paid from this present at the deter- mina?on of the time in the seuerall Bills specified. The Comittees for the Magazine are intreated by this Court to vnder- take for the cleering of these good? now come home in the Wi?m and Thomas; for the which it is now ordered, that they shalbe saued harmeles. It was now ordered, vpon the request of Sr Tho: Wainman, &amp; vpon certificate to the Court from the Lady Lawarr, that shee was content soe farr to satisfy the desire of the said Sr Tho: Wainman and Sr Iohn Tasborough, wthall desiring the allowance of the Court, that such men as shall appeare to haue beene transported by the Lo: Lawarr for the said Sir Tho: Wainman &amp; Sr Iohn Tasbrough, &amp; at their proper costs and charge may be free at his or their disposing to be remoued &amp; planted according to their discre?ons vpon such shares as shalbe by Pattent graunted vnto them, for the wch her Lãp is content, that there shalbe a ratable deduc?on made out of the propor?on of Land? allready graunted and allowed, or hereafter to be graunted &amp; allowed vnto the said Lo Lawarr for his Adventures: And that the Charter ?t wch his Lop entred into may not extend to the Losse and preiudice of them. It being noe part of his Lop or Ladsp meaning they should suffer for that his Lop stood engaged, and therefore resteth in her Ladishipp to see satisfied; Wch was also now confirmed by erec?on of hands.

IHS Good luck in the name of the Lord, who is dayly magnified by the experi- ment of your Zeale and Piety in giuinge begining to the founda?on of the Colledge in Virginia the sacred worke soe due to Heauen and soe "Longed for one earth, Now knowe wee assuredly that the Lord will doe you good, and blesse you in all your proceeding? even as he blessed the howse of Obed Edom and all that pertayned to him because of the Arke of God, Now that yee seeke the kingdome of God, all thinges shalbe ministred vnto you;" This I well see allready, and perceiue that by this your godlie determina?on, the Lord hath giuen you "fauour in the sight of the peo- ple, and I knowe some whose hearts are much enlarged, because of the howse of the Lord our God to procure yor wealth," whose greater [30] designes I haue presumed to outrun with this obla?on wch I humbly beseech you may be accepted as the pledge of my Devo?on and as the earnest of the Vowes "wch I haue vowed vnto the Allmighty God of Iacobb concerning this thing," Wch till I may in part performe I desire to remayne vnknowne and vnsought after. The thinges are these A Communion Cupp wth the Couer and case. A Trencher plate for the Bread. A Carpett of Crimson Veluett. A Linnen Damaske table cloth. Mr Alderman Iohnson reported, that according to the trust reposed by the last Court vnto himselfe and some others they had performed, by being wth the Lord? Comissioners about the cleering of the Tobacco now come home agreable to the Pattent, whoe referred it to Sr Lyonell Cranfield and mr Attorny Generall, but they being out of Towne, he desired that some other might now be appointed to attend the Lord? agayne for the finishing thereof: Wherevpon the Court haue desired, the Lo: of Warwicke, Sr Tho: Gates, Capt Nath: Butler, mr Clitherowe and mr Wm Caninge to attend them at such time as ffrancis Carter shall giue them notice that they sitt. Sir Iohn Wolstenholme moued the Court in the behalfe of Martins Hundred, that in considera?on of the Losse they haue sustayned by the Guift, wch they sett out, that they might haue shares in Virginia for euery—12—10—00 they haue therein spent: wch if the Court would please to graunte, it would encourage them to sett out ffifty men more in convenient time; which he desired might be putt to the question. To the Wch, reply was made by Sr Edwin Sandis Th?er, that hauing beene priuately acquaynted wth this mo?on, and hauing throughly waighed it, he could not giue way vnto for ffower reasons; 1.ffirst it was contrary to his Mats ?res Pattents; 2.Secondly it was repugnant to ye Standing orders of the ye Company. 3.Thirdly it failed of the very end it aymed at, for it was not any advancemt to the planting of Martins hundred. 4.ffourthly it was preiudiciall &amp; that in a high degree to the Generall Planta?on, &amp; to ye strength, peace &amp; prosperity of ye Collony. [31] He began wth the second reason as being fresh in memory, &amp; reading the Orders in the title of Graunts, he shewed, that all Land? were to be graunted either to Planters in Virginia by their persons, or to Adventurers by their purses, or by extraordinary merritts of service. That the Adventurers by their purses, were they onely and their Assign- ees, who paid in their seuerall shares of—12—10—to the Co?on Treas- ure for the charges of transporting men to the priuate Lands of the Adventurers, there was also allowance made to them of 50 Acres the person. But noe further allowance for any such priuate expences as was now demaunded. Then he came to the first reason, and shewed that these Orders were not newly deuised, but taken out of the ?res Pattent?, namely the second &amp; third; diuers passages of wch he there openly read, importing that the Land? in Virginia were to be deuided amongst the Adven- turers by mony, or service and the Planters in person, and that he is to be reputed an Adventurer by money, who payeth it into the Com- panies Treasury, insomuch that if any man be admitted for an Adven- turer, and haue paid in noe mony to the Co?on Treasury, he is to be compelled thereto by suite of Lawe, yea though he neuer subscribed to any such payment, as is expresly sett downe in the Third ?res Pattent?. Thirdly he shewed, it was not beneficiall to them of Martins hundred in point of advantaging their perticuler Planta?on, for the benefitt grew not by a bare title to Land, but by cultivating &amp; peopling it so to reape proffitt, now of such Land it was in euery Adventurers power to haue asmuch as he pleased wthout any other payment: ffor if an Adventurer (for examples sake) who had but one share of One hun- dreth Acres would send ouer Twenty men to inhabite &amp; occupy it, fewer at this day will not doe it, he was by the Orders allready estab- lished to haue for these 20 an addition of—1000—Acres of Land vpon a first deuision and as much more vpon a second; And if then he would also people his—1000—Acres wth Ten score men more, he were to haue another addition of—10000—Acres more vpon a first deuision and asmuch vpon a second, &amp; so forward to what extent of Land him- selfe should desire. On the other side to enlarge a mans right vnto new Land, and not to make vse and proffitt of the Old, were to increase a matter of opinion, rather then of realty, &amp; a shadowe rather then a substance. Lastly he said it was prieiudiciall to the Generall Planta?on in many points of ymportance; first in matter of strength for those titles to great extent of Land; so to keepe other from it, would be a great weakning to the Collony by disioyning the parts of it one so farr from another Vis Vnita Fortior. Againe it would be a great discouragemt to new perticuler Planta?ons if either they must sitt downe of bad land, the best being all taken vp before in titles, or seeke a seate farr of remote from helpe and society: Besides whereas by the orders now established, men are to encrease their owne Land? there by transporting of people, and so by increasing the Collony in strength &amp; multitude, the vertue and good intent of this Order wilbe defeated, if men may haue their Land? encreased wthout such transporta?on, &amp; onely by fauor &amp; plurallity of voic? in Cort. [32] Nowe as this mo?on is prieiudiciall to ye strength &amp; encrease of the Plantation, so is it also to the peace thereof, good government and iustice: It is not iust that a man should be paid twice for the same thing; ffor the men transported they haue allready allowance of Land —50—Acres the person whither dead or liuing: And the Charges now spoken of was but in transporting those men. It is not iust, that things equall should be vnequally valued; As Martins hundred hath beene at great charges, so §haue§ diuers other hundreds, so haue also beene many perticuler persons, Captaine Bargraue alone hath bought and sett out diuers shipps; if besides the persons transported, he shall haue allowance of Land oueragaine for all his charges, perhaps he may take vp a great part of the Riuer: What may my Lo: Lawarr doe? Sir Tho: Gates, and Sr Tho: Dale, besides a multitude of other who haue spent a Large por?on of their Estates therein and are not thought on; if all these men come in wth their Accounts for all their tyme, what a confusion &amp; disturbance will ensue thereof? shall wee deny that to them wch wee allowe vnto or selues? or shall wee admitt of their demaund? and sett them out Land accordingly? how then shall wee ?ceed in examining their Account?? how may they be cleered? when would they be ended? this course is a Laborinth and hath noe issue. He concluded, that he had allwayes fauoured the desires of Martins hundred; but for this perticuler, he would not approue it: Howbeit if men were not satisfied wth these reasons, he would be well content, that the matter might be referred to a Quarter Court, vnto wch it did more properly belong; and that in the meane time, it might be referred to the considera?on of a Graue Comittie to be indifferently chosen out of the Generallity and Counsell. Vpon this Sr Edward Harwood propounded, that for satisfac?on and encouragement of Martins hundred, there might be some quantity of Land bestowed vpon them by way of gratuity and seruice: wch was generally well liked, and the accomplishment thereof referred to the next Quarter Court, &amp; in the meane time the matter should be pre- pared by a select Comittee. And whereas the said Sr Iohn Wolstenholme Long since Lent the Company at one time 300li and at another time—100li, and after a Long time receaued it in agayne by Litle somes; that therefore in consid- era?on thereof, and that he receiued noe interest for the same, he moued, that the Court would recompence his kindnes by giuing him some Land; Wch was now thought reasonable, if the qrter Cort (as they doe not doubt) shall allow thereof. Vpon some dispute of the Polonians resident in Virginia, it was now agreed (notwthstanding any former order to the contrary) that they shalbe enfranchized, and made as free as any inhabitant there what- soeuer: And because their skill in making pitch &amp; tarr and sope- ashees shall not dye wth them, it is agreed that some young men, shalbe put vnto them to learne their skill &amp; knowledge therein for the benefitt of the Country hereafter. [33] It was ordered vpon considera?on that many principall men departeth the Court at or before six of the Clock, whereby the said Court is much weakned, that from henceforward they shall begin at Two, and end at six: after wch time nothing shalbe agreed of, or putt to the question: wch was confirmed by erec?on of hand?. The order of the Last Cort touching the dissoluing of the Courts till Michaelmas terme, being now putt to the question, was ratified by Generall consent. And for the Magazine Adventurers, it was licenced for them to meete where they pleased till the Generall Corts began againe, and soe often as they shall see cause, or be invited by any occasion. An Act of the Cort made Decimo quarto die Iunij 1619 concerning a Pattent graunted to Iohn Woodliefe Gen? and his Associat? is now by the consent of this Court, &amp; liking of the said Iohn Woodliefe altered, &amp; is to goe in the name of Sr Tho: Wainman &amp; Associat?: And is agreed vpon the request of the said Sr Tho: Wainman, that a ?re of informa?on there of shalbe written to the Gouernor, inasmuch as it wilbe the qrter Court in Michaelmas terme before it cann passe the seale, and that in the Interim he desireth land to be allotted, wherevpon to plant such men, as shalbe by him &amp; his Associat? sent or appoynted therevnto.</field>

[34] A ?re being sent from his Matie directed to mr T?er and Counsell for the sending diuers dissolute persons to Virginia, wch Sr Edward Zouch knt Marshall will giue informa?on of; after the Counsell had pervsed the same, was brought to the boord and read to the Company, who considering there was noe present meanes of conveying them to Virginia, though fitt to reserue the full answere to his Mats ?re till the next Court, when wth the Lord? &amp; mr Treasuror it might be agreed how his Mats Comaund? might most speedily and conveniently be effected: In the meane while Sr Io: Dãuers promised to acquaynt mr Secretarie Caluert and Sr Edw: Zouch the reason that they gaue not prsent answere to his Mats gracious ?re. Mr. Wi?m Caninge tooke occasion to expresse some kinde of griefe for the long want of Courts, in wch he had hoped of redresse in the point of what the Cort had ordered in the busines betweene him and his Associats defendants against Capt Bargraue in Chauncery, inti- mating that if the Courts had continued or might be kept at Sr Tho: Smiths he would not doubt of the whole Courts satisfac?on otherwise then had beene. Sir Tho: Smith and others appearing in the behalfe of him, and the defendants against Capt. Bargraue, but Sr Thomas could not &amp; others would not come to this place; and therefore wished that this Court had beene or others might be at Sir Tho: Smiths who had soe freely and courteously offred his howse; and through his Long experience and good will to the Ac?on, was able to doe the Company very extraordinary service: wch point? concerning the abillities &amp; courtesyes of Sr Tho: Smith were seconded by some others; but Mr Caning farther vrging the reconsidera?on of the Acte of Cort be- tweene him and his Associat? and Captaine Bargraue, and vttering some speeches of discontent, that onely Gentlemen had beene named of the Comittee, desiring a new refference wherein Citizens might also be ioyned; he was told of his wonted manner of seeking to interpose differ- ence betweene Gentlemen and Cittizens, a thing damned heretofore in Court as tending to onely to faction and disturbance of the peace of the Company: But for the matter of his mo?on to haue it renewed againe in Cort where he might presume to produce other testimony, or parties that had not either notice or leasure to be present at the former pro- ceedings, by wch he and his Associat? had beene vniustlie preiudiced as he conceiued; Some was of opinion that his mo?on was equitable; neuertheles it was held fitt, it should be referred to be moued againe at the next Court, wch should be like to be of a greater presence; Likewise wherein Capt Bargraue might be also heard what he might speake therevnto, least otherwise he might hereafter complaine &amp; so keepe the Court impertinently imployed to order backward and for- ward, and euen in a matter twice ordered by a selected Comittee chosen by the Court, who had a chiefe reguard vnto the case, as it appeares in the Court Bookes.

And first touching the Publi?, he shewed how farr the Company had allready proceeded. ffirst in Ianuary last there went ffifty men wth Sr George Yeardley to be Tenant? of the Gouernors land, whereof there failed by the way two or three, and six were now remayning to him of Capt Argolls guarde. Afterward in Aprill next twenty men should haue beene sent by Xofer Lawne vnto the Co?on Land, but he deliuered but 15 because the Company per- formed not wth him, touching the Loane of Corne and Cattle as he expected: Then 4 more were sent in the Triall according to the direc?on of his Matie. And in the begining of August Last, one hun- dreth more sent—50—to the Colledge Land and 50 to the Co?on: And for one hundreth persons or thereabout wch appeareth to haue beene sent in these 2 or 3 last yeares at the Companies charges, Sr Geo: Yeardley writeth of but three to be found remayning for the Company; So that there is by this Account vpon the Co?on Land 72 persons, 53 on the Gouernors, and 50 on the Colledges: 175 in the whole. Therefore he proposed now to be considered of against the Quarter Court this day fortnight that there might be sent the next Spring 130 men more, wch will make those allready sent for the Gou- ernor Colledge, and Co?on Land the full nomber of Three hundred, and so the Gouernor to haue 100 men wch will not be lesse worth then One thowsand pound? ? Anñ as it is esteemed. As for the benefitt of their labors of the Co?on Land, it standeth otherwise, for their moity is to be deuided betweene the Counsell and Officers there, [36] and for other publique vses, and betweene the Company here. ffor the Counsell who attend? there, when the Gouernor at all times shall please to call them, cannot neglect their busines wthout reward; soe likewise here, the Company may not expect, that although their T?er for the time past and ?nte, as also the Deputies of late serue meerely out of their zeale and loue to the Ac?on, yet those that shall succeede will happily expect a yearely gratifica?on, when the Company shalbe enabled by their Rents to yeild it. And for the Colledge, there is noe doubt but the benefitt ensuing will build it, and raise a Revennue for the mayntenance. He also thought it fitt to send 100 more to be Prentizes or Servants that the rest may goe on more cheerefully, wherein he hoped the citty would deale as worthily as heretofore. Lastly he wished that a fitt hundreth might be sent of woemen, Maid? young and vncorrupt to make wifes to the Inhabitñnt? and by that meanes to make the men there more setled &amp; lesse moueable who by defect thereof (as is credibly reported) stay there but to gett something and then to returne for England, wch will breed a dissolu?on, and so an ouerthrow of the Planta?on. These woemen if they marry to the publi? ffarmors, to be transported at the charges of the Company; If otherwise, then those that takes them to wife to pay the said Company their charges of transporta?on, and it was neuer fitter time to send them then nowe. Corne being here at home soe cheape and plentifull, and great prom- ises there for the Haruest ensuing. Then to euery 100 men, he aduised there might be sent 20 young Heifers wch wilbe Threescore, and they wth their breed will soone store the Publique. He also shewed, that the Inhabitants hauing had great ioy by the Charters of Graunts and Liberties lately sent by Sr Geo: Yeardley, desired now to haue choise men sent them from the Lowe Countries to raise ffortifi- cations, whose charge they will beare, wherein my Lo: Generall Cesills assistance was perticulerly entreated. Then he spoke of the way of transporting these persons, wch by reason of the intollerable charge the Company is at by sending ships, that that course should be left of and rather send by those that trade to Newfoundland at Six pound? a man, wch wilbe found to be great ease vnto the Company; but for the Catle a shipp must be sent on purpose, vnlesse a bargayne may be made for them at 10li— a peece, as he hath some hope giuen him that it may be. The totall charge of all this, furnishing the men reasonably wth all things requisite, will amount (as he hath computed it) not aboue ffower thowsand pound?; And one thowsand more will furnish them in best sort. Then how this mony shall come in, he shewed how much the Company was bound to giue thankes to God for all his blessings, who continually rayseth meanes for the supporting of this worke, making men?on of one vnknowne Gentleman that hath offred to send to him 500li— for the converting and educa?on of Threescore Infidells Children, whensoeuer he shall require the same &amp; vndertake that worke. And also that vpon his ?res he had receaued advertizement from sundry parts and some of them very remote, that if they goe on wth this busines they shall not want for money. Like- wise Gabriell Barbor [37] hath promised of Lottary monies to bring in before the end of March 35 hundreth pound?, wch he intend? accord- ing to the promise made vnto the Lord? shall goe to noe other end but the advancement of the Planta?on. And for the Three thowsand pound?, wch was spoken of when he entred to be T?er he hath not as yet receaued the whole, but as it cometh in, it shall all goe for the payment of former debts and dueties, whereof he had discharged aboue 2000li allready, promising that he will not leaue the Company one penny in debt by any Act to be done by him. And for the ratifi- ca?on hereof, he referred it to the qrter Cort, onely now proposing it, that in the interim it might be considered of by the Company. Next he acquainted, that the Counsell sitting this morning at my Lord of Southamptons, there were some mo?ons made for ye busines at home, one was concerning Tobacco in Generall, that the planting of it here would be the destruc?on of the Plantation, and therefore that the Company might be humble suitors for an inhibi?on thereof; but this was conceaued might be a scandall for Virginia, as that it could not subsist wthout that weed, intending very shortly to sett in hand with Iron-workes, &amp; the Country affording diuers other good comodities, as Silke, Silkegrasse, Corne, Vines, etc. And therefore it was thought better by the Counsell, forasmuch as the ffarmors of Impost had it on foote allready that they proceed, and the Company as they see occasion to assist them. ffor the perticuler Tobacco of the Adventurers remayning in the Custome howse, he was desired by the Counsell to drawe a ?re in their names, and to be signed by them, wch he promised forthwth to performe, to be addressed vnto the Kings Lerned Counsell, shewing the priuiledges of their Pattent, and the Losse they haue sustayned by this extreame delay wth earnest request of present expedi?on. And seeing that mr Iacobb contrary to the priuiledges of their said Pattent; the Letter of his Mats priuy Counsell in their behalfe, and the Adventurers offer to leaue halfe wth him, that they might obtaine the other halfe to sell away that it might not all perish, had reiected all mo?ons and meanes of agreement, and in contempt of their Lops Letter refused to deliuer it vpon those reason- able condi?ons sett downe by their Lp?, that therefore he thought it very expedient (the Lord? consent? being first obtayned) that the Company co?ence an Ac?on of damages against him, the losse they haue receaued being estimated by many at—2500li—wch mo?on so suted wth the desire of the Court (sauing that the Lord? consent was thought vnnecessary) that for the rest they intreated it might be putt to the question: wch being done, and also propounding whither the suite shall proceed at the Co?on charge, being for the maynteñnce of the Pattent, and the Magazine to appoint Sollicitors, was ratified by erec?on of hand?; The Court hauing now chosen for their Counsell, Sr Lawrence Hide and mr Xofer Brooke; And to sollicite the cause mr Tho: Melling for the Company, mr Iames Berblock for the Maga- zine, and mr Richard Caswell is entreated to assist them. [38] According to the refference in the Last Court his Mats ?re was now taken into most dutifull considera?on, and it was agreed wth all con- venience to fulfill his Mats comaund, and to send them ouer to be servants, wch wilbe very acceptable vnto the Inhabitant?, as mr Th?er hath vnderstood from them, and in the meane time till they may be sent, wch wilbe about Ianuary, Mr Treasuror shewed, that in like case the Lo: Maior had beene sollicited to giue order for the keeping of them in Bridewell, wch was answered to be performed allready, and the Court desired mr Treasuror to giue his Maty an answere by mr Secretary Caluert. Mr Iohn Delbridge mo?on for a Pattent to be graunted him and his Associats intending to transport—200—men was assented vnto and referred to the Auditors vpon Monday morning to haue his Pattent perfected. Whereas mr Wm Canings complaint the last Court was referred vnto this present to be heard betwixt Captaine Bargraue &amp; him, he being now absent was by diuers now present censured to be a great disturber of the peace of the Company, &amp; molester of the Courts wth matter of ffaction: Therefore when the Counsell meetes, that he be warned to attend them to receiue admoni?on and if that after he continue in his wonted byas, that then he be disfranchized according to a standing order in that behalfe. And whereas formerly a seale for the Company called the Legall seale was referred vnto a Comittee to consider it §in§ what manner it should be, and nothing as yet done therein; It was agreed that Mr Claren- tious be intreated to giue the Auditors sometimes a meeting at Sr Edwin Sandis, where they will deuise to take a Cote for Virginia and agree vpon the Seale. fforasmuch as noe deuision of the Iointstock is yet made to the Adventurers, according long since to promise, nor any acco heth- erto presented (though often called for) whereby they may vnder- stand the state of the busines, and other Accounts intermixed wth them be cleered; therefore vpon generall request of the Ad- venturers now ?nte, it was agreed that the Counsell be entreated to take the busines into their hand?, and to call the Officers of the Magazine before them to giue vp their Acco, as also to heare aswell the obiec?ons of the Adventurers, as the answeres of the Officers, that soe right be done, and the differences Long depending may be freindly decided and ended: Wch mo?on was also extended to such accompts of the former Magazine as remayne yet vncleared. [39] And although the Company is allready exceedingly behoulding to my Lord of Southampton for his many honoble fauors &amp; nobly counte- nancing them in all their businesses, and especially such as is of great- est importance; yet notwthstanding the Cort are most humble suitors vnto his Lõp, that he would please also in these businesses of so great importance, and wch haue beene the onely cause of distrac?on and dis- cention in the Company, to vouchsafe his presence at that meeting of the Counsell, that by his Lops and their authority, those differencs might be concluded, the Com? satisfied in their right, and all occa- sion of continuing iealousies and displeasures be remoued: Wch mo?on being made by mr Th?er was by Generall erec?on of hand? confirmed noe one dissenting. Mr Th?er also moued, that Captaine Bargraue should be desired by the Court, that at leastwise after the examina?on of his witnesses (vpon wch he resolutely insisted) he would then be content to referr the Controuersy betweene him and some other of the Company, to be heard in like sort and arbitrated by the Counsell, that so all cause of scandall and discord amongst the Company might haue an end: Vnto wch Captaine Bargraue gaue his consent, and the same was generally well approued of by the Court.</field>

Mr T?ers proposi?on at the last Court being now read and consid- ered of, Sr Iohn Wolstenholme intimated, that for his part [40] he liked them very well, but wthall moued that some of the Company might be appointed by the Court to examine whither the monies to come in, would be sufficient to doe this, and to leaue some remayning in the Treasury to defray such charges as either by his Mats comaund for the sending ouer such men as he shall write for, or otherwise may accidentally happen. Wherevnto was answered, that these Proposi- ?ons had beene formerly proposed to the Counsell at Southampton howse, where they were generally approued to be beneficiall and advantagious for the Planta?on, And therefore not fitt they should be reassumed from thence to a priuate Comittie, Esteeming the Counsell the chiefest Comittee could be chosen. Also mr. T?er to the generall satisfac?on of the whole Court made this answere, that for those nombers to be setled on the Co?on, Gouernors and Colledge Land, he would not leaue the Company indebted one penny: As for former debts he had allready paid aboue 2000li toward? discharging of them, and a 1000li he would pay when it came in, wch was asmuch as was left vnto him, doubting not but that the yearely comodities coming out of Virginia, would henceforward defray all accidentall charges; it hauing beene truly alleadged before, that the planting and peopling of the Companies Land was the surest way to bring in Revennue. It was alsoe answered by others, that all that was in Cashe was but to be imployed to the advancemt of the Planta?on, and that there could be noe better worke to further that then this, nor nothing more hurt- full then to leaue vnperformed those designes &amp; workes wch themselues are certaine and good, for things accidentall and vncertaine; So as noe man further opposing, The former Obiec?on vanished. And it was moued by my Lo: of Southampton, that the Court hauing now heard the Proposi?ons read, if they made scruple of any thing, that it might be now debated at full against the Quarter Court. But noe man either seconding the former, or raising any new obiec?on, the Proposi?ons rested wth generall approba?on of the Court. Touching the Legall seale spoken of in the last Court, the Auditors at their Assembly haue therein taken some paynes, wch they now pre- sented to this Courte: And whereas they had spoken to one for the cutting of it, there is one mr Hole who would appropriate that vnto him selfe vnder pretence of hauing a Pattent for the engrauing all seales, wch hath the Kings Armes or any part thereof, wch he now pre- sented to the Court, and mr T?er pervsing the same, found, that it was for the Kinges armes, but not for any part thereof, and therefore appointed them to repaire to mr Xofer Brooke of Lincolnes Inne to examine it, and to bring his opinion vnder his hand in writing, &amp; accordingly it should be determined. Next for the order of the Magazine Acco referred to the Counsell, My Lord of Southampton was humbly desired to lend his presence for the concluding of it: This and the former Magazine being the cause [41] of all discentions that hath beene amongst the Company, who hath promised his assistance. And Sr Iohn Wolstenholme for the better concluding thereof hath also promised that he will giue order for the meeting of some of the Adventurers, together wth mr Essington to examine the State of the Magazine, &amp; the Account? against the Counsell meete. Mr T?er also signified, touching the Standing orders that nothing is done, in wch time discouereth not some imperfec?ons, acquaynting that some § stood in § need of some small explana?on, and that there needed to be an addi?on of Two or three more, wch although yet they cannot be soe absolute as the others, wanting the Ceremonies due vnto them, yet till that be performed they stand (if the Company soe please) as orders of a Quarter Court, wch to that Court was referred. Mr T?er desired the allowance of this Court of one thing agreed of by the Auditors and Comittees of the Colledge, wch was that 1400li—od mony in all being receaued of the Collec?on monyes by Sr Tho: Smith, of wch vpon seuerall occasions, therewas vented by way of Loane for the vse of the Company Eight hundreth pound?, the Remainder being 500li odd money was paid vnto mr. Treasuror; Therfore that the said 800li—might be reimbursed out of the Co?on Cash in to the Colledge mony, wch was ratified and allowed of by the Court. Vpon a peti?on exhibited by the wife of Abraham Persey, that in lieu of his Long service done the Company, they would gratify him wth giuing him some Land in Virginia: wch sundry of the Cort acknowl- edgin[g] his paynfull endeauors, haue agreed for the present to giue him 200 Acres (if the Quarter Court vpon Wedensday next shall allowe thereof; And hereafter as they finde him discharge the busines reposed vpon him, to reward him accordingly. Also vpon the peti?on of Mathew Cauell Master of the Wm &amp; Thomas, shewing that in considera?on of a Bote &amp; ship Anchor deliuered to Capt Samuell Argoll for the vse and benefitt of the Plantation, Re?d of the said Capt Argoll in Virginia his freedome &amp; 400 wtt of Tobacco, wch since his coming home, he could not receiue from the Custome howse wthout putting in caution to pay to mr Iacobb Two shillings a pound, therefore in reguard of his said freedome, desired he might Copart of the like priuiledges the Company doe. Wch was answered, that Capt Argoll could not giue him his freedome, for none can be free but by two wayes, either by money brought in, or by some extraor- dinary service: Wherein was alleadged, that he did speciall service in the begining of the Planta?on: Wherevpon he was appointed to make knowne his deserts in writing, &amp; accordingly, he should receaue the Companies fauour.

Before the reading of the Corts there was presented by mr T?er a list of all the Counsellors names of Virginia, being of Earles, Barons, Knights, Gentlemen and Citizens about 100 in all, wth this Caution that if any heard themselues named, and had not taken their Oaths, they were to repair to the Lo: Chauncellor or the Lo: Chamberlaine to be sworne. Afterward the writing conteyning an addi?on &amp; explana?on of cer- taine Lawes and orders for the Company presented in the Preparatiue Court, was now againe read and by generall consent referred to the Comittee formerly chosen for the Lawes &amp; orders of the Company. The Courtes being read, mr Treasuror putt the Court in remembrance of his former Proposi?ons propounded in the Cort iijo Die Nouembris hauing before that propounded them to the Counsell, and lastly to [43] the Preparatiue Court, and desired to haue the iudgment of this Great and Generall Court concerning them: Where, vpon the request of some noble§men§ ?nte, he related them againe to the Cort in effect as followeth; Mr. Th?er therefore declared, that his care and duety running ioyntlie for the advancemt of this noble Plantation, his desire carried him chiefly to the restoring of the Publi?1 1 This term refers to the Company land or property in Virginia. now lately decayed, and the reforming of some errors, wch had directed their charges and the labors of the Collony to a wrong and vnworthy course, and greatly to the disgrace and hurt of the Planta?on: ffor whereas not much aboue Three yeares agoe there were returned from Virginia Twelue severall Comodities sold openly in Court to the great honor of the Ac?on and encouragemt of the Adventurers: Since that time there hath beene but litle returned worth the speaking of, saue Tobacco and Sassaphras, which the people there wholy applying, had by this misgouernemt reduced themselues into an extremity of being ready to starue (vnles the Magazine this last yeare had supplyed them wth Corne and Cattle from hence) to the stopping and great discouragemt of many hundred? of people, who were prouiding to remoue themselues to plant in Vir- ginia. The cause of this error he would not insist vpon, as loth to giue offence by glaunce of speech to any, but for remedy thereof (besides often letters from the Counsell sent lately to the Gouernour for restraint of that imoderate following of Tobacco and to cause the people to apply themselues to other and better comodities) he had also by the advice of his Mats Counsell here, and according to one of the new orders now propounded, caused to be drawne a new Covenant to be incerted in all Pattents of land hereafter to be graunted, that the Pattentees should not apply themselues wholly or chiefly to Tobacco, but to other Comodities specified in the said Coueñnt, An example whereof they should see in the Pattent lying before them to be passed in this Court to mr Iohn Delbridge and his Associats. Now touching the Publique, he was first to present to their remembrance how by the admirable industry of Two worthie knight? Sr Tho: Gates and Sr Tho: Dale, it was sett forward in a way to greate perfec?on, whereof the former Sr Tho: Gates had the honor to all posterity to be the first named in his Mats Pattent of graunt of Virginia, and was the first who by his wisedome, valor &amp; industry, accompanied wth exceed- ing paines and patience in the middest of so many difficulties laid a founda?on of that prosperous estate of the Collonie, which afterward in the vertue of those beginings did proceed. The latter, Sr Tho: Dale building vpon those founda?ons wth great &amp; constant seuerity, reclaymed almost miraculously those idle and disordered people and reduced them to labour and an honest fashion of life, and proceeding wth great zeale to the good of this Company sett vp the Co?on Garden to yield them a standing revennue, placed servants vpon it, as also vpon other Publi? workes for the Companies vse, Estab- lished an Annuall rent of Corne from the ffarmers, Of tribute Corne from the Barbarians, together wth a great stock of Kine, Goates, and other Cattle, being the good? of the Companie for the service of the Publi?, wch hath since beene the occasion of drawing so many perticuler Planta?ons to seate in Virginia vpon hope [44] and promise of plenty of Corne and Catle to be lent them from the Publi? for their ease and benefitt vpon their first ariuall. But since their times all these publi? prouisions hauing beene vtterly Laid wast by such meanes as hereafter in due time shall appeare. It hath beene his principall care in those places wherein it pleased the Com- pany to comaund his service to sett vp the publi? againe, in as great or greater hight then heretofore it had: The maintayning of the publi? in all estates being of noe lesse importance, euen for the benefitt of the Priuate, then the roote and body of a Tree are to the perticuler branches: And therefore to present vnto them all in one view both what had beene allready done, and what yet remayned to be perfected, he recalled to their remembrance, how by their Comission sent by Sir George Yeardley they had appointed 3000 Acres of Land to be sett out for the Gouernor so to ease the Company henceforward of all charge in mayntayning him: 12000 Acres of Land to be the Co?on Land of the Companie; viztt three thowsand in each of the ffower old Burroughes—10000—acres of Land for the vniuersity to be planted at Henrico; of which—1000 for the Colledge for the conuersion of Infi- dells: The next care was for the placing Tenants vpon these Land?: In January last there went wth Sr Geo. Yeardley 50 Tenant? for the Gouernors Land transported at the Companies and furnished at his charge, and six he found remayning of Capt Argolls guarde: In the March afterward there were sent §twenty§ to the Companies Land by Mr Lawne, whereof he hath deliuered yet but 15, for want of per- formance to him of loane of Corne and Cattle: ffower more were sent by the Triall, and Three Sr Geo: Yeardley found in the Country. In the begining of August last in the Bona Noua were sent 100 persons for publi? service, chosen wth great care, and extraordinarily furnished, whereof 50 for the Companies Land, and 50 for the Colledge Land, So that making deduc?on of some fewe that are dead, there were he hoped at this day 174 persons, placed as Tenants vpon the Publique. Therefore his first Proposition was, that the Company would be pleased, that these Tenants for the Publi? might be encreased this next Spring vp to the nomber of 300, viztt one hundreth for the Gouernors Land, 100 for the Companies and 100 for the Colledge Land; wch (if he be truly informed by those whoe best should knowe it) being rightly imployed will not yeild lesse in value then Three thowsand pound? yearely revenue for these publi? vses. And because care both hath beene, and shalbe taken that diuers stayed persons and of good condi?ons haue beene and shalbe sent amongst them, His second Proposi?on was, that for their ease and comodiousnes, there might be 100 young persons sent to be their Apprentices, in the charge whereof he hoped this Hono? Citty, would pertake wth the Company as they formerly had done: And because he vnderstood that the peo- ple thither transported, though seated there in their persons for some fewe yeares, are not setled in their mindes to make it their place of rest [45] and continuance, but hauing gotten some wealth there, to returne againe into England: ffor the remedying of that mischiefe, and establishing of a perpetuitie to the Plantation, he aduised and made it his Third Proposi?on, to send them ouer One hundreth young Maides to become wifes; that wifes, children and familie might make them lesse moueable and settle them, together with their Posteritie in that Soile. His next Proposi?on was, for the mannor of transporting these per- sons thus to make vp ffiue hundreth for the Publi? Land, wherein he advised, that they should not as heretofore hire Shipping for this purpose, whereof euery Shipp at his returne in bare fraught and wages emptied the Cashe of 800 and sometimes 1000li, but that they should as they had allreadie done this present yeare take the opportun- itie of the Ships trading to Newfoundland, and so to transport them at six poundes a person wthout after reckonings. A ffifte Proposi?on for the sending of 20 Heifers vpon eu9y 100 of these Tenants, Threescore in the whole, wch he hoped might be done taking the opportunity of Shipping in the Westerne parts at Ten pound? a head 600li in the whole. Lastly touching the charges he related perticulerly as formerly he had done, diuers great incouragements of supply to come in: he estimated the whole charge at ffoure thousand pound? to be done sparingly &amp; bountifully at 5000li: He promised not to leaue the Company one penny in debt for any thing in his yeare to be performed: And more- ouer that he would discharge 3000li of former debts and reckonings according to the Stock left in the Lottaries at his coming to this place: This done he hoped the Publi? would agayne be well restored, A founda?on Laid for a future great state, The Adventurers and Planters well comforted and encouraged, All matter of scandall and reproach remoued, and so he would comend the Ac?on to the blessing of God. These Proposi?ons after some pause, receauing noe opposi?on were putt to the question &amp; receaued the generall approba?on of the Court. Next he acquaynted that at the Court of elec?on, there was choice made of Sixteene Comittees, one third part of them being vnsworne, who since that time haue seldome or neuer mett, or afforded their presenc? therefore desired that in their steed? wch had not taken their oathes, others might be chosen in their Roome, men knowne to be of wisedome and industrie, and whose Zeale to the Ac?on might appeare by the menaging of the Companies busines, wch now grew great &amp; waighty; Wherevpon there was nominated mr Doctor Winstone, mr Shepherd, mr Rich: Bull, mr Wi?m Cranmer, mr Daniell Darnellie, and mr Tho: Mellinge, who from time to time have promised their best assistance, &amp; therevpon receaued their oaths.

Which Compa of the Somer Ilands are all members of the Virginia Company and for the mutuall strength of both parties are soe to continue. All wch notwithstandinge the ffarmors of his Mats: Customs by a generall rate made of Tobacco att xs the pound in regard the Spanish Tobacco is worth much more though the Virginia Tobacco give not halfe so much, demaund of yor Supplyants vjd the pound for their Virginia Tobacco wch they humbly desire may be rated att a iust valew by itt selfe (wch they shall willingly pay) and not raysed to the double by cooplinge itt wth the Spanish wch is sould ordinaryly att 18s the pound and some times att more. They Complaine allso to your LLps: of mr Iacobb ffarmor of ye Impost of Tobacco who by color of a much latter Graunt from his Maty demaundeth of them an other vjd the pound vppon their Tobacco contrary to his Mats most gracious Graurt, and wch allso itt is not possible that poore Comodity can beare. They humbly therfore offer to yor ?ps: Considera?on wheras for the support and increase of that Planta?on to draw on the Collony more cheerfully to apply their labour, they have erected here a Society of ?ticuler Adventurers for Traffique wth them of Virginia in a Ioynt Stocke for dyvers years commonly called the Magazine, and have contracted with ye people ther, as for other Comodities so ?ticularly to give them iijs a pound for Tobacco, by vertue of wch Contracts a great multitud of people have lately beene drawne to remove thither, and not soe fewe as one Thowsand Personns are providinge to goe and Plant there in the Springe approching, that if to that iijs be added this 12d demaunded by the ffarmorr together wth other charges of ffraight Cr itt will exceed the vttermost vallew wch att this day the Tobacco can be sould for, and consequentlie must needs dissolve this Traffique established.

[56] The Company here quickned wth hope of proffite by traffique and by this mutuall negotia?on his Mats Customs advanced: And accordingly in Iune last their Ship returned and brought home Twenty thousand pound weight of Tobacco for wch besides the Marchandize bartered wth them there they are to discharge here aboue Eight hundred pounds of Bills of Exchange, And vppon returne of their Ship they brought their goods into the Custome house as they were required that they might be weighed and the Custome answered for the same wch they were most willinge and redy to discharge, Mr Iacobb of his owne authority interupted the weyinge of their Tobacco and forbad farther proceeding vnless that impost of vjd a pound were allso paid vnto him.

But mr Iacobb refusinge to ?forme yor ?ps: order and exactinge of them another bond, vizd to pay him his demaund att a certaine day vnless they ?cure in the meane time a discharge from yor ?ps: wch they thought vnfitt to vndertake beinge not in their power to effect hath ever since now for the space of fower monneths and vpward Contrary to his Mats ?res Pattents and yor Lops honor- able ?res (an example vnheard of) forceably deteyninge their goods to their damage att least of—2500li partly by the impayringe therof in worth through dryinge and other corrup?on and partly by the Sale of price vppon the Store of English Tobacco wch hath since beene made They further Complaine of mr Iacobb that wheras the So?er Iland? are yett free for two years and an halfe vnexpired of very Custome and Subsedie, mr Iacobb who standinge by his Officers at Plymouth hath caused 12d the pound to be exacted for their Tobacco, and bond to be entred for the payment therof on the Sixth of this monneth vnless yor lops: shalbe pleased in the meane time to discharge ye same. In considera?on of wch premises these Peti?oners most humbly beseech your good ?ops: that wheras they are now in treaty for the providing &amp; settinge forth of two Ships imeadiately, the one to Virginia expresly for his Mats service, and the other to the Somer Ilands for the necessary fortefyinge and securinge of that place, And for as much as they dare not lett them Carry thither soe vnwellcome news, as in the ?ticulers before sett downe And forasmuch allso as the prepara?ons for the transport of those = 1000 = Persons are now all att a stand waightinge vppon the success of this present buisines that yor ?ps: of yor accustomed goodness and fauor toward this Planta?on, and to preserve itt from vtter ruine now threatned by those Courses wilbe pleased in vphould- inge of his Mats: gracious Graunt vnto them to cause their goods thus deteyned to be att length deliu9ed vppon payment of such duties as of right ought to be paid.

[57] Captaine Argoll vppon his owne desire to answere to such Crymes as are imputed to him in the time of his Gouerment hath been sundry times summoned to meete the Councell att Southampton house where haveinge sett many daies, Mr Th?er now presented the passage of their seuerall ?ceeding? wth him devydinge his charge into three partes. Capt Argoll? de- sire to answer such Crimes as are im- puted to him. Mr Th?er? reporte of their proceed- ings with him. 1: His Offences in matter of State, 2: The Depreda?on and spoile of the publique wth other offences to the Company and Councell and 3: his oppression there of the Collony in generall and sundry ?ticu- larr men. To the Two first mr Th?er vppon the desyre of the Counsell was con- tent to collect the falts, and sett downe §in§ Articles the greivances of the Company because the said Capt Argoll desyred to answere every pointe in writinge. Butt the third of the opression of the people haveinge no affinitie wth the two other part? may be answered by themselvs when Certificate shalbe returned from thence of the same hee haveinge answered to the 4 firste Articles of Matter of State, The second parte of deprad?on was deliu9d vnto him in Eight Articles by mr Th?er earnestly desyringe the Courte (as the Councell think? itt Convenyent) that the prosecutinge herof might be taken outt of his hands, and referred accordinge to the Councell? order vnto a Lawyer and a Marchaunt to solicite the Companies cause against him: And allso Capt Argoll desyred that in respect hee was no great Scoller that hee might have liberty to entertaine Councell to defend his Cause: Soe the Courte for the Company have now made choyse of mr Edward Harbert for the Lawyere and mr Tho: Keightley for the Marchant agreeinge that all the writings and evidences shall be putt into their hands, And that the T?er and Councell shall be iudges of the buisines, Mr Deputy promisinge to enforme and ease them as much as hee cann, allowinge allso of Capt Argoll? request. The buisines to be referrd to a Law- yere &amp; a Marchant. Capt Argoll to en- tertaine a Coun- cellor. The Compa choise of their Lawyere and Marchant. Wher vppon hee made a second that in regard Sir Thomas Smith was then Th?er, and may say some thinge to some orders wch was given him, that this buisines might be heard att his house, wch mr Th?er, said hee would not gainesay, whensoeuer the mattere were handled to the knowledge of Sr Tho: Smith, And the rather for that the firste move- inge against Capt Argoll ?ceeded from Sr Thomas Smith, and mr Al- derman Iohnson, wth some other as appeareth both by their letters to Capt Argoll himself of the 3d of August i6i8, As allso by their other ?res to the Lord Lawarr att ye same time, wherin they charge him wth all or most of the said Crymes, &amp; that in verie sharpe sorte; Re- quiringe the Lord Lawarr to send him home to his answere to sequestre his goods there and to restore to the publique all such Cattle as hee had alyenated wthout lawfull warrant: Capt Argoll? sec- ond request Wheras the last Court agreed to give vnto my Lord of London? Reg- ister for his paines in their Collec?ons the some of xx pound? form9ly ?mised mr Th?er informed that his llop: hereing therof was not well pleased therewth and would not assent that any ?t of the 1000li wch hee had sent in should be deminished: As allso that accordinge to the Archbishope of York? desyre hee had sentt him 200 new breif? for Collec?on. [58] My Lor: of Lon- don? dislike of xxli to be giuen to his Register. 200 new briefs sent to ye Archbishop of Yorke. The Councell meetinge accordinge to the referrence in the last Court and ?vsinge the ?res Pattents grew to this Conclusion that by the lycense of the said Councell itt might be lawfull for either of the said Collonies to fish wthin the liberties the one of the other butt since some of the Northerne Collony flyinge from that agreement pretend to Consider better of itt before they will give answere therevnto.

The resolu?on for paymt only of ye: 5:?C. graunted by ye King in his ?res Pattent? con- firmed And therfore forasmuch as their Virginia §Tobacco§ was never yett sould in any sale that tooke effect att aboue five shillings the pound but many times vnder they could not give way to pay more for Cus- tome then three pence vppon the pound wch is full five in the hundred yett so that if hereafter itt should rise to a higher price they would willingly encrease their Custome to the highest of that rate. if ye Virg: Tobacco rise to a higher prise they are con- tent to encreas the Custome to the highest rate.

[120] The sentence of the last Courte beinge drawne vp and engrosed of disanullinge of the Condempnation of Captaine Brewster by a Mar- tiall? Courte in Virginia summoned by Capt Samuell Argoll att such time as he was Deputy Gouernor there, and beinge now read att the place to this effect that the wholl Courte agreed Captaine Brewster to have been vniustly proceeded against both in forme and matter, and consequentlie remaynes still a legall man not one dissentinge, Sr Tho: Wroth onely tooke excep?on to these words (not one dissentinge) In somuch as hee now professed himselfe to be of a contrary opynion, and yt att that time hee held vpp his hand against yt, And that the reason therof was for that Capt Argoll alleadginge that hee had answered Captaine Brewster in Writinge, that writinge of Capt Argoll? was nott read att the hearinge of the cause; Against wch Allega?ons of Sr Thomas Wroths the wholl Courte did generally oppose averringe that hee did not vphold ?vp? his hand against the sentence seeinge if hee had so done itt must have been seen by some of the Courte wch itt was not, no not [one] of them wch on purpose did observe him And that when mr Th?er did openly pronounce that the wholl Court was agreeinge no one dissentinge itt had been then fitt time for him to have declared his dissentinge wch hee did not.

Courte might have been read if itt had beene desyred, butt because the tryall itt sellfe by a Martiall? Courte, was disaproved their manner of ?ceed- ings was not regarded: And if the same had been read itt would have cleerly appeared that they ?ceeded against Capt Brewster not by ver- tue of the Laws of England butt vppon the 32 Article of ye Martiall Laws of the Low Countries, by wch Disobedience to any principall Officer was made death: and the Disobedience of Capt Brewster was in Commaundinge the Lo: Lawarres men then vnder his charge from the works vnto wch they were sett by Captaine Argoll to the works for wch they were sent by the said Lo: Lawarre and his ?tiners, Butt that the hearinge of this cause betwene Capt Brewster and Captaine Argoll was onely by word of mouth on both sides and not by writinge and that both ?ties were heard att large and wth all indifferrencie; Notwithstandinge the Court was content so much to sattisfie Sr Tho Wroth that an excep?on of him should be incerted att that clause, and further vppon the said Capt Brewsters request have agreed that a Duplicate of the said sentence shalbe sent to Virginia to shew yt hee stands cleere.

[157] My Lo: of South- ampton His Lop: further signified that hee had received breife ?res of the saffe arivall in Virginia of all those Ships save one wch were sent the last Springe And that three of the best of them had made a prosperous Voyadge in six weeks or there aboutes, And that of 200 ?sons trans ported in ye Ionathan there died aboue 16: Of 70: in the Swann of Barnstable not one, of 200: in the London Marchant but one onely, And that the Dutie in her long passage had likewise lost one; And lastly that of the number of the Cattle wch they then allso sent they had intelligence by the reporte of one man that they had lost tenn for wch they had againe in their passage 8 Calues, butt there was no certificate thereof as yett returned from the Gouernor.

After these businesses were thus ordered: and the Court nowe full, my Lord of Southampton moved that if the Company so pleased they would now goe to the elec?on of their newe Gouernor of Virginia who was to succeed Sr George Yeardly after the expiration of his said Co?ission (wch is to determine in Nouemb: next, Sr George Yeardley having then allso a desire to release and disburden himsellf of the said place of Gouernmt:) The Court therfore proceeded having agreed to a present elec?on my Lo: prayed the Company that if according to his former admonition they had bethought themselues of any person of quality fitting for so eminent a place that would be willing to vnder- take the due managing thereof that they would now please to nomi- nate the man, who might be put to the ballating box to geather wth Sr ffrancis Wyate who was formerly proposed and recomended vnto them.1 1 Letters from Sir George Yeardley to Sir Edwin Sandys, concerning his desire to be released from office, are mentioned in List of Records, Nos. 247 and 254, page 148, ante.

Sr Edwin Sandys signified vnto the Company that my Lord of South- ampton by reason of this buissy time of Parliamt: could not be spared to be here at this present meetinge; and therfore desired to be excused, he further acquainted them, that the occasion of their being assembled this day, was to let them knowe, howe carefull he had been, in the drawing vp of their newe Patent, nowe presented to be read vnto them, [187] wherein he reported, what extraordinary paines he had taken, aswell to amend in this newe draft, the defect? he had noted in all the former Patent?, also to supply out of them, and other Presedent? of like nature, what he in his owne experience and iudgement had observed to be necessary for them, as also he had not omitted to inserte therein, such necessary cautions, as would hereafter secure and save them harmeles, against any Proclamation or Patent, that might (as heretofore) be procured to their preiudice, the same being once passed vnder the Seale and confirmed by Act of Parliament. But before the reading of this Newe Patent, he desired to acquainte them wth some altera?ons he had made therein, differ- ing from the former Patent?, especially in two point? namely in the head, and in the body thereof. ffirst in the head, That whereas in the former Patent? their cheife officers were called by the name of Treasuror he had in this given him a more eminent title, by styling him their Gouernor: because the name Treasuror seemed to imploy an inferior officer and one that was to be an Accountant. My Lo: of Sout?- tons absence de- sired to be ex- cused. Sr Edwin Sandys declara?on of drawing vp ye new Patent And because the Northerne Colony-Adventurors, had to their Terri- tories given the name of New-England, he thought fitt that theirs did still retaine the ould name of Virginia. for by this meanes all Virginia should be theirs, for the body of this Patent, as namely in their new Incorpora?on he said, he had likewise differed from the former in two point?: first in the materiall parte thereof, by abrideging the same, and restrayning it onely to such Adventurors and Planters as have at least one share of Land of 100 acres in Virginia Cr. In the formall parte thereof, as well to avoide the infinity of names by reason of the multitude of Adventurors (encreasing still more and more,) as for that many were already named in a former Patent he therfore thought good in this to name only the Lord? of the higher howse of Parliament, and add therevnto these words comprehending in effect all the rest: viz: togeather wth all other [188] Adventurors and Planters in Virginia Cr. some other necessary altera?ons and addi?ons, he said he had made in some other parte of the said Patent, wch in the reading he would notifie vnto them desiringe their attenta?on attencons to the reading thereof, and to giue their best advise about the same. Before the Patent was read through, because the Afternoone was farr spent it was vpon a motion agreed and ordered that the Court should continue till all buissinesses were ended. The Court con- tinued It was also moved by some of the So?er Ilands company that ye Court would please to thinke of some Course that might be forthwth taken in hand either by peticoninge to his Matie: or to the howse of Parlia- ment, to declare thereby the great hinderance and losse that both the Planta?ons had susteyned by the late Proclamation and Graunt of the sole importa?on of Tobacco to certaine Patentees: As likewise vnder coulor thereof: of their iniurious proceedings against both the Com- panies in that they have not onely stinted them, to too scant a ?por- ?on but have also restrayned them from sellinge their Tobacco lately brought from the So?er Ilands wthout their Seale &amp; allowance first had for wch they were to pay for garblinge the same after the rate of fower pence ?li. A mo?on of some of the Su?er Ilands Compa: sig- nifying ye great losse they haue sustayned by ye Late Proclama?on Cr.

And therein to complaine of the former greivances tendinge to the vtter destruc?on and overthrowe of both the said Planta?ons, whereof they doubted not but they should finde the like redresse as of many other monopolies of like nature which the lower house had called into question and by his Mats: gra?ous ?mission intended vtterly to extinguish. [189] A peti?on to be drawen to ye lower house of Parliamt. It was therfore ordered that a Comittee should be appointed for draw- ing the said peti?on and for this purpose nominated Sr ffrancis Wyate mr George Sandys and mr Deputy fferrar who are desired to take some paines therein and to make it in substance agreeable to that wch Sr Edwyn Sandys had deliuered vnto them.

Sr Edwyn Sandys being desired to make reporte what had ben done concrning the newe Patent, signified vnto the Company, that whereas the Lo: Viscõnt Doncaster had form9ly ?sented a letter from the Counsell to the kinge, wherein among other things they did humbly entreate his Mats: most gra?ous favour, to renewe [191] their Patent, and that the same might be allso confirmed by Acte of Parliament, the better to strengthen the Plantation in generall by engaginge of the whole State in the interest and support of the Action: It pleased his Matie: to signifye his graceous pleasure by my Lord of Doncaster to mr Attorney generall for drawinge vp the same: To wch end he said, that he and mr Herbert and mr Deputy had attended mr Atturney about the same, presenting him the drafte wch had formerly been read here in Courte: and having acquainted him, wth the order he had vsed throughout the said booke by reducing it into three head? vizt. the first contayning such y?unities as had been graunted in their former Patent?, the second some addi?ons as they had taken out of the So?er Ilands Patent, the third such newe clauses as tyme &amp; experience had taught, to be necessary for them: wherevnto he added likewise a fourth wch was the amplifyinge and enlarging some neces- sarie point? as were in generall word? imployed in their former Graunt?. In reading whereof mr Attorney well obserued that their newe Incor- poration differing in name from the old (the T?er beinge in this called by the name of Gouernor:) was not warrantable in lawe in that manner as they had drawne it, wthout surrender of the form9 Pat- ent?, for that it did thereby imploy two distinct Corpora?ons: But this point mr Atturney vndertooke to amend by altering the forme, and framing it another way: But as for such new clauses &amp; addi?ons wch they had made, mr Attorney desired he might have a speciall warrant from his Matie: to that effect: To wch purpose Sr Edwyn Sandys said there was nowe a peti?on drawne to be exhibited to his Matie: for procuring a reference to such of his Highnes most honoble: priuy Counsell as it should please his Matie: to assigne, to take con- sidera?on of those newe clauses wch they desired to be inserted in their Patent wch peti?on my Lo: of Doncaster out of a noble desire to farther all occasions tendinge to the good of the Planta?on was pleased to vndertake to present vnto his Matie: and to solicite for answeare touching their request. [192] Sr Edwyn Sandys report of what had been done about the new Patent. Sr Edwyn Sandys moved that in regard mr Edward Bennett a Cittizen had so well deserved of this Company by a treatise wch he made touching the inconvenience that the importa?on of Tobacco out of Spaine had brought into this land: and by his often attendance vpon the Co?ittees of the lower howse of co?ons about the same, (who were well inclyned to afford their best assistance for prohibiting the bringing in of Spanish Tobacco) that therfore he might haue the favor to be admitted a free member of the Company wch mo?on was thought very reasonable and being put to the question was generally assented vnto and confirmed by erec?on of hand?. mr Edward Ben- nett made free. Whereas Captaine William Newce out of a generous disposi?on and desire to advance the generall Planta?on in Virginia (being induced herevnto by reason of a good successe he had in Ireland vpon the like worthy Action) hath freely offered vnto the Company to transport at his owne cost? and charges 1000 persons into Virginia betwixt this and midsomer 1625: to be there planted and imployed vpon a pertic- ular Planta?on: and intendeth to goe over himsellfe in person, the better to direct and gouerne his owne people over whome he prayes, he may be appointed their Generall and to that end desireth a Patent wth that propor?on of land, and wth such large and ample priviledges besides, as are vsually graunted to others in that ?the like? kind. And further aswell in considera?on of the Chargeableness, of the enterprise he vndertakes, as also for his better encouragemt there- vnto, he desireth the Company would ?please? graunt him the place of Marshall in Virginia, which office he affecteth the [193] rather, because he hath ever been exercised in Military affaires and Armes, (as may appeare by his many worthy services performed in Ireland, well knowne to diuers honoble: persons of this kingdome, who have testified the same sufficiently vpon their owne knowledge to his exceedinge great Co?enda?on): And desires likewise that he may be allowed 50: men to be placed as Tenant? vpon the land? to be alotted vnto the said office, wch he vndertakes to transporte and furnish wth apparell and necessary implement? for 8li: the ?son charge vnto the Company (whereof the Moytie he desires present payment) wch persons beinge there arryved he will maintaine and vphould at his owne charge from tyme to tyme duringe his continuance in the said office: The Court havinge therefore duely considered of his proposi?ons (concerning wch the Counsell had also treated wth him formerly) were pleased to giue order that a Patent should be drawne for him, as ample as any other, wth all manner of priuiledges, saving the Tytle of Generall, wch they could not graunt him, because it was a tytle properly belong- ing to the Gouernor only. Capt Wil?m Newce offer to transport 1000 persons his request for a Patent. his request for ye place of Marshall in Virginia A Patent graunted him And forasmuch as Captaine Newce hath given so large a testimony of his experience and skill in Marshall discipline wherein he hath bene exercised and imployed a long tyme, vpon many seruices in Ireland, as allso in matters of fortifica?on and other warlike experi- ment? no whitt inferior to any (as hath been also testified) and for that he hath also promised to imploy his best endeavors and service, to the good of that Planta?on (wch is like to proue a matter of great consequence vnto it) in considera?on whereof although there be no present necessity or vse of such an officer in Virginia (in reguard of the perpetuall league lately made betweene the Gouernor there and the Indyan Kinge) yet to gratifie his worthy vndertakinge [194] the Company are pleased to grant him the said place of Marshall, wth 50: men to be his Tenant?. And if the State of their Cash (wch the Adventurors are now desired to examine,) will ?mitt, they will pay him in hand one Moytie of the money that he desires, and the other Moytie vpon Certificate from the Gouernor of his arrivall in Virginia: As for other condi?ons of the Contract to be made betweene the Com- pany and him: It is agreed and ordered that ye generall Comittees assisted wth some of the Counsell hereafter named, shall further treate and conclude wth him about ye same, touchinge all perticularities whatsoeuer, and to this end are desired to meete at Sr Edwyn Sandys house vpon Saturday being the 14th of this present Moneth.

Mr Smith signified vnto the Company that my Lady Berkley out of a desire to be a member of so honoble: a Company and to giue some furtherance to so hopefull a Planta?on was pleased to offer her sellf to come in vpon one share of land nowe at first for wch shee would pay in her 12li 10s. And therfore [195] moved her lap: might be admitted into this Society: which mo?on was thought very reason- able and was generally assented vnto. My La: Berkly ad- mitted to be free. He likewise moued that in regard mr Ouldsworth (now in Virginia) when he was in England lyved in that reputa?on and Creditt as befitted a gentleman of his ranke and quality being a Iustice of peace and of the Quorum; and that in respect of his worth and sufficiency he might be admitted one of the Counsell of State in Virginia, wch mo?on was also conceaved to be very reasonable, and therfore ordered that it should be moued in a Quarter Courte; And besides some place should be thought vpon for him suitable to his personall merritt and worth. mr Oulsworth to be one of ye Coun- sell of State in Vir- ginia. Sr Edwyn Sandys moved that for so much as Sr ffrauncis Wyate, is by a generall elec?on appointed to succeed Sr George Yeardley in the place of Gouernor over the Colony in Virginia; whose Comission determines in Novemb: next: That therfore the generall Co?ittees, assisted wth those of the Counsell, formerly named, might consider, both what charges and what Company, and other prepara?ons shall be fitt and necessary to be provided for a man of his quality and place, whereby Sr ffrauncis Wyate may the better vnderstand howe to accomodate himsellf against his goinge: wch mo?on was thought very important and therfore the Court ordered it, to be referred to the Comittees formerly nominated. The Comittees to consider of the charge Cr yt is to be prouided for Sr ffra: Wyate. Captain Mathewe So?er? peti?on is referred to the examina?on of the said Comittees before whome he is required to make it appeare what was due vnto his Vncle Sr George Somers as likewise ye iustnes of his Clayme therevnto in the right of his said vncle now deceased whose heire he pretendeth himsellf to be. [196] Capt. So?er? peti- ?on referred. Sr Edwyn Sandys moved, that for somuch as Sr Richard Bulkley hav- ing purchased two shares of land for wch he had paid in his 25li: intended nowe to make a perticular Planta?on in Virginia, and to send over 100 ?sons at his owne Charge: moued that he might for that purpose have a Patent graunted vnto him: wch mo?on was accord- ingly assented vnto. A Patent to Sr Rich: Buckley. Sr Edwyn Sandys signified that there was one (vnknowne to him by face) was nowe in hand wth an excellent Tretise consisting of these five speciall head? Defence, Plentie Health, Trade and Manners, all tendinge to the reforma?on of the Colony in Virginia, and the future advancement of the generall Planta?on: moved therfore that the Court would be pleased to make request, that the said Treatise might be perfected against the next meetinge: Wherevpon the Court entreated the same might be ready against that tyme. The treatise of de- fence Health Cr. to be ready agt: ye next meeting. It was likewise moved that for somuch as there hath hetherto been observed so great neglect and remissenes in the Gouernors: of Virginia, from tyme to tyme (to the infinite preiudice of that Planta?on) in that they haue not duely performed those direc?ons, which haue from hence been Co?ended, to their care and execu?on, whereby little or nothinge hath been effected, answearable to the great care and charge the Company haue been at, for planting good and staple Comodities in that Country, to the great scandall of the gouerment there, and noe lesse discouragement of the Adventurors here, that for reformation hereof such an [197] officer may be chosen, to be sent thither, who might in the qualitie of a Treasurer not onely to take into his ?ticuler charge the Rent? and duties of what kind soever, belonging to the Company here (there being at this instant aboue 1000li: due vnto them) but also take into his speciall reguard and care, (as principally reco?- ended to his peculiar Charge onely and for wch a good Ac?ount wilbe expected) to see those direccons and co?aundement? wch he shall receaue from hence, duely and faithfully executed from time to time or otherwise to render a sufficient reason to the Contrary whereby the Company hereafter may be better informed and satisfied in the pro- ceed of their buissines and affaires in Virginia: wch mo?on the Court greatly applauding, as that wch carried wth it the greatest consequence, and being desirous that such an important officer, might be forthwth thought vpon: The neglect in the Gou9nors for plant- ing of Staple Com- odities. An officer to be sent in ye quality of a Treasuror It pleased my Lo: of Southampton to propose a gentleman, well knowne vnto them all, as a man very fitt to take that charge vpon him namely mr George Sandys who indeed was generally so well reputed of, for his approued fidelity sufficiency and integrity: as they conceaved a fitter man could not be chosen for that place and there- vpon agreed to his elec?on; referring him to the former Comittees to be further treated and concluded with concerning the same. mr George Sandys named for Treas- uror. Herevpon, and vpon declara?on of the State of the newe Patent made by Sr Edwin Sandys, mr Smith tooke occasion, first to ?test that his eye, in that he had to speake, reflected not either vpon ye person of the nowe Gouernor: in Virginia, or vpon the new Gouernor here in Court, or vpon any other in perticular but for the generall honor: and welfare of the Plantation, was to entreat of my lord of Southampton &amp; the Counsell: that in the said Patent (if no such [198] addi?on of power were therein inserted) authority might be given to the quarter Court?, to question the Gouernor of Virginia here in England if the ill merritt of his government should so deserve, and to puñish him by fyne or otherwise. ffor he could not but declare that not publicum but priuatum co?odum did seeme to have ben their end? of effecting that place: for his private letters (whereof he had at tymes receaved aboue forty) did as he thought truely informe: That no direc?ons or instruc?ons (which wth sin?ler wisedome dilligence and care) had from tyme to tyme issued from the Treasuror: and Counsell here; had been put by them in execu?on to the losse of many mens lives there, to the hinderance &amp; scandall of the whole Planta?on and to the disesteeme and slightinge of the ?sons of the Treasuror and Counsell here, and the authoritie of the whole Court, wch he onely presumed to co?end to their considera?ons. But herevnto answeare was made yt it was the opinion of mr Atturney generall vpon a smaler matter in their newe Patent then this was (namely the punishment of labourers artificers and such like offenders) that he feared, it would have much adoe to passe wth such a clause the house of Parliamt. And besides they had already power in their said Patent to displace the Gouernor vpon iust occasions: which was conceaved to be as much as would be graunted vnto them by Acte of Parliament touching that point.1 1 This is the last mention of the new patent.

Mr Smith likewise moved: That for so much as ye lottaries were now suspended, which hetherto had continued the reall and substantiall food, by which Virginia hath been nourished: [199] That insteade thereof, shee might be now preserued, by divulginge fame and good report, as shee and her worthy Vndertakers did well deserue, declar- ing that it could not but much advance the Planta?on in the popular opinion of the Co?on Subiect?, to have a faire &amp; perspicuous history, compiled of that Country, from her first discouery to this day: And to haue the memory and fame of many of her worthies ?though they be dead to liue and be transmitted to all posterities?: As namely Sr Thomas Dale Sr George So?ers Sr Walter Rawleigh the Lo: Dela- warr Sr: Thomas Gates and divers others wherevnto were it not for suspition of flattery he would wish also the names of many her other worthies yet livinge and some of them now present in Court, might have also their honoble : and good deserving? co?ended to eternall thankefullnes, for that our inhabilities had as yet no trewer Coyne, wherewith to recompence their paines and merrite, affirming also, that the best now planted part? of America, vndr the Spanish gover- ment nor their Annales or histories of those times, in their like ages of ours nowe 12 yeares old Virginia afforded better matter of rela?on then Virginia hath donn; and doth, which what effect such a gen- erall history (deduced to the life to this yeare) would worke through- out the Kingdome with the generall and co?on Subiect, may be gathered by the little Pamphlett? or declara?ons lately printed: And besides fewe succeedinge yeares would soone consume the lives of many whose livinge memories yet retayned much and devouered those letters &amp; intelligences which yet remaine in loose and neglected papers: for wch boldnes in mouinge hereof he prayed his Lops: par- don, ledd herevnto vpon the request of some of his fellowes of the Generallity. [200] mr Smiths Mo?on for a faire history to be put out in Print Cr. wch worthy speach had of the whole Court a very great applause as spoken freely to a speciall purpose and therfore thought fitt to be considered of and put in practise in his due time.

Whereas it hath been taken into considera?on howe importantly necessary it is to establish two such officers in Virginia as Marshall and Treasuror whereby the one might take into his care and charge aswell the fortificacon Armes and forces of the Colony there, and to cause the people to be duely trayned vp in military services and in the vse and order of Armes, and so from time to time to [201] mayn- taine the greatest strength that may be against all forraigne invasions, And that the other, might not onely wth like care take into his Charge the Rent? and debt? that now and here after shalbe due vnto the Company (there being already aboue 1000li to be answeared vnto them) but further also see those direc?ons that he shall receave from home for the setting forward all staple Co?odities duely and faith- fully executed from time to tyme (wherein a very great neglect hath hetherto been observed to the infinite preiudice of that Planta?on) And for asmuch as Captain William Newce hath been specially reco?ended vnto this Company by divers honoble: persons of this kingdome for his fidelity iudgement and sufficiency to vndertake and performe the said office and service of Marshall as having ever been exercised in military affaires and Armes: And for the said place of Treasuror because mr Sandys was in like manner proposed whome all men conceaved to be every way sufficient, to take that charge vpon him: It was thought fitt and ordered that the generall Co?it- tees, assisted wth some of the Counsell, should meete togeather and advise aswell for setling of the said offices and places and for accom- odating them wth fitting allowances and people. As also to take the like care that the Newe Gouernor shortly to be sent be well provided and accomodated fitting for his place and quality, Wherevpon mr Deputy desired Sr Iohn Dauers to deliver what had been donn by the Comittees concerning the same who reported that they had taken great care and paines therein aswell to informe them sellves out of other President? what had been allowed in the like kinde as also of the present State of the Cash what it was now able to performe.1 1 The system of government for the colony is mentioned in List of Records, No. 261, page 149, ante. [202] The officers of Marshall &amp; Treas- uror held very necessary. Capt Newce for the place of Mar- shall. mr Sandys for ye place of Treasuror. The Generall Com- ittees to advise for ye setling of the said offices. It was reported by Sr Io: Dauers yt ye Comittees had taken great paines Cr And first for the place of Marshall the said Comittees haue allotted 1500: acres of land to be appropriated to that office for ever, And the number of 50: ?sons to be placed as Tenant? vpon the said land? which the said Captain William Newce hath vndertaken wthin one yeare after his arrivall in Virginia to procure and place vpon the said land? well furnished wthall thing? necessary for the cultivatinge thereof and the same number to maintaine and keepe, and so to leave to his Successor. In considera?on whereof they have agreed to paye vnto him the said Captain Newce 200li: in hand at the sealing of his Co?ission for that place and other 200li toward? the discharge of his shipping and Marriners wages vpon their returne from Virginia, or in default thereof vpon Certificate of the landing of his people in Virginia. Allowance for ye maynteñnce of ye place of Marshall. And for the maintenance of the said Treasuror, the said Comittees have likewise allotted 1500: acres of land perpetually to his office, and 50: men to be placed therevpon, in the quality of Teñant?, whereof 25 to be sent this yeare, to accompany the person of the said Treas- uror, and the other 25: the next yeare following: who is also to have the passage of his owne family (not exceeding the number of 10: ?sons) to be transported at the Comps charges: And toward furnish- inge of himsellfe for the voiage, according to former President? in the like nature, they thought fitt to allowe 150li. Allowance for ye maintenñce of ye place of Treasuror. And concerning Captain Thomas Newce (the Companies deputy in Virginia) aswell in discharge of a former ?mise made vnto him as also to thend his reward might be no lesse then others whose paines and desert? they doubted not but he would equall they have agreed to add 10: ?sons more (when the Comp: shalbe able) to make vp his former number 50. [203] Capt Thomas Newce 10 persons. The Comittees thought meete also, that for all officers thus setled, the same priviledges (graunted vnto the said Captaine Thomas Newce deputy) should in like sort be given vizt: that whosoever for their sakes should bringe in any adventure of 12li 10s: the money so brought in, might be imployed for encreasing the numbers of men belonging to their places and likewise the hallf of all such old debt? due vnto the Company vpon subscrip?on that shall be procured and brought in, by their meanes. The Priviledges graunted to Capt. Tho: Newce to be likewise grãnted to these officers (vizt) Cr. And as touching the Gouernor: shortly to be sent: It was thought fitt to haue all necessaries in such readines as to have him shipped and be gon the Voyadge by the prime of Iuly and the men to be taken in, at the Ile of Wight. The Gou9nor to be gonn by Iuly. ffor the more speedy effecting whereof, it is also agreed that the Comittees should be required to enquire out the Shipp meete for this intended voyadge. The Comittees to enquire out a Shipp. It was allso thought fitt by the said Co?ittees not to allowe ye Gou9- nor: lesse then two hundred pound? for all necessary provisions to be made for his voyadge And to allowe him the transport of himsellf and such as shall attend him so as the number exceed? not 20 ?sons. 200li allowed by ye Comittees to ye Gou9nor: &amp; ye transport of 20. persons. All wch allowances the Court thought very reasonable and therefore reco?ended them to the Confirmation of the Quarter Courte. Mr Deputy signified that according to the direc?ons of the former Co?ittees, they had made enquiry and had already found out a very good Shipp, called the George very fitting for their purpose wch mr Wiseman offered vpon these Condi?ons following vizt yt shee should carry no more then 80 men [204] and them at 6li a man after wch rate he desires to have the whole payment in hand: he demands likewise for each tuñ of good? 3li: &amp; to carry no more then may conveniently be stowed in the Hold, wthout pestering the decke. He hath promised likewise to allowe to every two Passengers one Chest, fraight free: And further for his fraight homeward? he will take it as it falls out and offereth to bynde himselfe to bring the Companies Tobacco at 3d the pound or otherwise to leave it, at their pleasure for the price and whither they will accept to have it brought in his Shipp or no; wch mr Ewens also agreed vnto, offring to carry their Tobacco as good Cheape as another, and otherwise they did not desire it. The George found out by ye Comit- tees. mr Wysemans offer. Wch proposi?ons the Court thought very reasonable and therfore rec- omended it to the Quarter Court, and wthall enioyned the said mr Ewens, to haue his Shipp in a readines by the first of Iuly next, either at the Ile of Wight, or where the Comittees shall appointe, whome he is required to attend for that purpose. The said offer rec- o?ended to the Quarter Court. Sr Iohn Dauers delivered (and referred it to the Considera?on of the Courte) a mo?on that fell out to be made after the treaty of the Com- ittees concerning the former officers was concluded: wch was that in reguard of the vsuall constitu?on of men and land? to belonge to every cheif officers place, and some reason &amp; experience had found that the officers Teñant? were cheifely reguarded and the generall Companies Tenant? the more neglected: it therfore might be fitting to cast and allott all the Gou9nors and other officers Teñant? into the ñmber of the publique and out of [205] the whole proffitt? belonging to the Com- pany, and the said Gouernor: and other officers should have their ?ts proportionable to the number of Tenant? appointed vnto them. By wch meanes there would be a more generall care for the advancing publique affaires and proffitt of the generall Company since all the officers interest and Comodity was therein imployed; which mo?on being conceaved an Innova?on and to overthrowe thing? already estab- lished was (as the case nowe stoode) thought more likely to introduce a conceipt in the people of inconstancy of their governmt: &amp; conse- quently a discontent then such a due reforma?on as might be hoped. Nevertheles it was worthy considera?on whither the Treasurors place and other hereafter to be established might not very fittingly be referred to receaue their propor?onable mayntenance from the proffit? of the publique Teñant? since it was very probable that these officers so to be mayntained would imploy their owne care, and likewise by their dilligent watchfullnes enduce the former established officers, to bestowe their paines more fully and diligently for the raising of the Companies proffitt and not so much to intend their owne ?ticulers: wch mo?on was thought fitt to be considered of hereafter. Sr Iohn Dauers mo?on for casting and alotting all ye Gou9nors and other officers Teñnt? into ye number of the Publique: Mr Wrote moved that for somuch as the Gouernors: hetherto as he had heard had not donn according to their instruc?ons to cause their Tenant? to plant and builde howses whereby they might haue a fixed place of abiding and subsistence that therefore the newe Gouernor and all others hereafter might be the more strictly dealt wthall, in their Instruc?ons concerning that point whereby the Company may not be inforced hereafter at the seaven yeares end to send over fresh supplies of ?sons vpon a newe charge wch mo?on was thought fitt to be recomended to the care and considera?on of the Counsell and to insert that Prouiso in his Comission and Instruc?ons. mr Wrotes mo?on of the neglect of Gou9nors in not buildinge howses. Cr. Whereas in respect of the personall worth and merritt of mr: Ouls- worth nowe in Virginia a mo?on was made for conferring vpon him the Chansellor ship ?Chauncellorp?: wherein he had [206] some good experiences: It was aunsweared that for somuch as the place is chal- lenged by another gentlemen pretending a former graunt thereof from the Company in respect of his adventure, it could not be graunted: The Court therfore thought fitt, to respite the same vntill it might appeare what title or pretence the said gentle?n had therevnto. The Place of Coun- sellorp: to be con- ferred on mr Ouls- worth referred. Mr Deputy acquainted the Court that for so much as the orders of the Company did require every officer to give vp his Account for the yeare past at this Quartr Court according to his place he thought good for somuch as concerned him and to yeeld them a true Account (not doubting but that ?te of Account wch concrned my Lo: of South- ampton himsellf it would please his Lop: to relate vnto them to their good satisfac?on.) Every officer to giue vp his Ac- count. Concerning mr deputies Account? he shewed that whereas he had receaved divers So?es of money of his Lop: to be disbursed by him and the Comittees in making provisions of all sort? for divers shipps and people this yeare sent to Virginia he was not able at this Court to giue vp a ?fect Account of all the ?ticulars to the finishing of it. In regard that himsellfe and the Comittees for the more speeedy dispatch of the said Shipps and people formerly sent had bought divers sort? of provisions vpon their Creditt? hoping to have receaved money ere this tyme from mr Barbor for clearing those debt?. Wherby his Account? might have been perfected against this Quarter Court. Concrning mr Dep- uties Acco?t. But the sodaine suppressing of the Lottaries have caused that money came not in as they expected; And forsomuch as the Companies Stocke lyeth now altogeather in plate, and therfore not so ?sently able to be turned into money, wthout to great losse but hoped it would by the next Quarter Court wch would be about five weekes [207] hence; for these reasons he did humblie entreate this Court that they would be pleased to respite his Account? till the moneys were receaved for the paying of such debt? as were to be discharged vpon the last yeares Account wch being cleered he promiseth to bring in his Account wch the Court thought verie reasonable. mr Deputies re- quest to respitt his Account?. Touching Sr Edwyn Sandys Account he likewise declared that in his absence he was to signify vnto them, that whereas Sr: Edwin at the giv- ing vp of his place stood bound for the Company, for certaine Su?es of money wch were ordered to be paid vnto him for discharge of the fraight of divers shipps, and other things, wch Shipps for somuch as all of them are not yet returned but daily expected he therfore desired his Account? might likewise be respited till the next Quarter Courte after this: By wch time hee hopeth the Shippes wilbe returned, whereby he may discharge her according to the Contract, as wee ?hee? had well and carefully donn all othrs for wch he stoode engaged, wch mo?on was likewise thought very reasonable and of necessitie to be graunted. touching Sr Edwyn Sandys Account. Mr Tucker moved in the behallfe of one mr: Norewood whome hee much comended for his approved skill and experience in surveying of land? and for so much as there was so great vse of such an officer in Virginia for meating out and distinguishing the true lymitt? and bound? of each ?ti?ler Planta?on and that he was very desirous to goe vpon that service that therfore the Company would please to accept of him for their Surveyor: The Court herevpon referred him to the Comittees to be further treated wth about the same. mr Morewood re- ferred to ye Comit- tees to be treated with. Mr: Deputy having informed the Court of mr Newland? good affec?on to the Planta?on and of his extraordinary paines and care he had taken about the Shipping of the ?sonns transported in ye Abigaile taken in at the Ile of Wight: In considera?on whereof the Court was pleased to bestowe vpon him ·5· shares of land, recomending the same to the confirma?on of this Quarter Court. [208] 5: shares of Land bestowed on mr Newland. It was likewise moved that for somuch as mr Bonnall keeper of the king? Silkewormes at Otland? had so well deserved of the Company by his Care in procuringe the ffrenchmen from Languedock wch were heretofore sent to Virginia and had likewise reported well of Virginia to his Maty: vpon occasion of speach (comending the Mulbery trees in that Country to be of the best kinde) moued therfore that the Court would please to gratifie his good deserving? wth the guift of some shares of Land and to make him a free brother of the Company wherevpon it was ordered he should have two shares and have his admittance accordingly. Two Shares be- stowed on mr Bon- nell &amp; admitted to be free. The Auditors and Comittees according to a former order of Court having taken into their considera?on the many buissinesses incident to the Secretaries office (farr exceeding that wch was donn by the former Secretary) thought it fitt in considera?on thereof to enlarge his Salary from xxli ? Anñ: to 40li: for the time to come and for the yeare past to reward him wth 20li: more then his former stypend in respect of his paines extraordinary. The Secretaries Sallary enlarged. Sr Iohn Dãuers signified that it was the request of my Lady Lawarre vnto this Courte that in Considera?on of her good? remayning in the hand? of mr Rolfe in Virginia shee might receave satisfac?on for ye same out of his Tobacco nowe sent home, But for so much as it is supposed the said Tobacco is none of the said Rolf?, but belonged to mr Peirce, it was thought fitt that mr Henry Rolfe should acquaint my Lady Lawarre of his Brothers offer (as he informes) to make her Lap: good and faithfull Account of all such good? as remayne in his hand? vpon her Laps: direc?on to that effect. [209] It was signified vnto the Court that my Lady Lawarr and her sonne had assigned 40: shares of land in Virginia vnto mr Carter for sun- drie Adventurors of the Company wch they desired might passe the approba?on of this Courte wch being allowed by the Auditors was graunted. Where, vpon, mr Carters moving to passe these shares followinge, his request was graunted. My Lady Lawarr 40: shares to mr Carter. To mr Henry Rainsford 2 shares To mr Craddocke 1 share To mr Palmer 1 share To mr Iohn Harte 1 share Shares passed by mr Carter. Thomas Colby of London Silkeman peticoning for the Adventure of his Brother Edmondy Colby who paid in xijli xs 1609. as likewise for the Adventure of his said Brothers ?son, being long since dead, and he next heire: The Court was pleased to graunt him his request recomending the same to the Quarter Courte to be confirmed. Tho: Colby his re- quest graunted. The Court vpon like request passed these other ?shares? following vizt. mr Peire 2 shares to mr Barbor. 2: shares from mr Lott Peire to mr Barbor. 3· shares from mr Downes to mr Iohn Smith mr Downes ·3· shares to mr Iohn Smith. Vpon request of mr Raph ffogge that he might have the shares passed vnto him by assignemt: confirmed vnto him vnder the Companies Seale, It was moved that it might be referred to the Auditors and Comittees that such a generall Course might be taken, for better assurance of shares of land vnto each man, that they might have it passed vnder the Seale of the Company in regaurd that papers were apt to be torne and lost. mr ffoggs request to haue his shares confirmed vnder ye Comps: Seale. Mr Woodall is required at the next Quarter Court in Middso?er Terme to make his ?sonall answeare to such scandalous speeches as he had form9ly divulged in disgrace of the Booke authorised by his Mats: Counsell for Virginia and in the meane time he stand? suspended from cominge to Court?. [210] mr Woodall re- quired to make his answere. Mr Capps having put a peticon to the Counsell and Comittees at their last meeting, for satisfac?on of Certaine land wch he said was taken from him by the Gouernor: in Virginia at the arrivall of Captaine Newce because the said land fell in that parte where the Companie had appointed &amp; ordered there land should be sett out: The Counsell and Comittees thought it not fitt vpon his report to make any such satisfac?on but to leave the matter to be fully examined by the Newe Governor: and therein they promised Iustice and equity. mr Capps peti?on to be examined by ye newe Gouernor. But in regard the said mr Capps was knowne to have donn much serv- ice to the Company in the space of 12: yeares wch ?whilst? he lived in Virginia and had not receaved the Reward of ·2· Kyne wch ye Com?: had three yeares agoe given him, (as some of the Company remem- ber) They thought it therfore fitt (wthout preiudice he pretend? in ye land) to bestowe on him the passage and transporta?on of five men in reward of his good service: To wch the Courte gave consent and referred the Conclusion to this Quarter Courte. mr Capps to haue ye passage of 5. men free Mr Henry Rolf? peti?on in the behallfe of his brother Iohn Rolfe in Virginia, is referred to the Auditors and Comittees to be examined, who are desired to make report what they shall thinke fitt to be donn therein. mr Henry Rolf? pe- ti?on referred.

Mr Deputy signified vnto the Company that my Lo: of Southampton could not be here at the begiñing of this Court by reason of some speciall buissines this afternoone at Parliament. And therfore desired that in the meane tyme they might begin to order something in reguard of many matters they had to dispatch: wherevpon after the Act? of the former Court were read, he began to remember them of those ?ticulars yt had been ?pounded [214] in the Preparatiue Court and referred to the confirma?on of the greater Quarter Courte. My Lo: of South?- ton can not be ?nte at ye begiñng of ye Court. And first that whereas it hath been taken into considera?on how necessary and behoufull it is to establish two such officers in Virginia as a Treasuror and a Marshall whereby the one might be Accountant to the Company here for such rents and dutyes as shall yearely accrue and belong vnto them (there being already 1000li: due in that kind) and especially take care, to cause such direc?ons as from hence ?shall? proceed touching the setting forward of good and staple Comodities be duely and exactly executed from tyme to tyme, the neglect whereof hetherto hath been an infinite preiudice vnto the Plantacon: And that the other officer namely the Marshall might vndertake ye Care and Charge aswell of the ffortifica?ons as of the Armes and forces of the Colony and to settle it in that propor?on of strength as it may be able to defend it sellfe against all forraigne Enemyes. The establishing of the two officers of Marshall and Treasuror. To wch end and that these officers might be mayntayned, care had been taken by the Comittees, assisted wth some of the Counsell accord- ing to an order of Courte, and to state and endowe the said offices wth a convenient Salary: wch they had propor?oned in man9 follow- inge. The Comittees care in stating ye said offices. ffirst vnto the place of Treasuror they had allotted 1500: acres of land to be cultivated and manured by 50: ?sonns to be placed therevpon in the quality of Teñnt? at hallf?, to belong to the said office for ever: whereof 25 to be sent this present yeare ?voyage? and as many more the yeare ensuing: wch number of 50 ?sons ye Treasuror is bound to mayntaine and leave to his successor. Moreover toward? the Charge of necessary provisions to be made for the said Treasuror they had allowed (according to former President?) 150li: and the free transporte of his owne family not exceeding the number of 20 ?sons. [215] T?ers Allowance. And vnto the place of Marshall in like manner they have thought fitt to allowe the like propor?on of land and Tenant? to be appropri- ated to the said office for ever, And for asmuch as Captaine William Newce nowe proposed for the place of Marshall vpon speciall reco?- endacon of his sufficiency to performe the said service, hath vnder- taken to plant and furnish out wth necessaries, the said number of 50 persons all wthin one yeare vpon the said land, and them to maintaine and leave to his Successor. In consideracon hereof the said Comit- tees have thought fitt, the better to enhable him herevnto to allowe him 200li: in hand toward? the Charge of his present setting out, and other 200li: vpon Certificate of his arryvall in Virginia: wch severall allowance this Courte having duely considered conceaved to be very reasonable, and being put to the question did ratifye and confirme But for the manner of managing the said offices it was thought fitt to reco?end yt tothe Care and wisedome of the Counsell to prescribe the same, and to order and lymitt their proceeding? by instruc?ons.

It was further signified that the said Comittees have likewise thought fitt to allowe the Gouernor noe lesse then 200li: for all necessary ?visions to be made for this his present voyadge wth free transport of his owne family not exceeding twenty persons Wch being now put to the question was ratified and confirmed by a generall errec?on of hand?.

Sr Iohn Dãuers having formerly taken a fitt occasion to moue did now againe referr the same to the consid- era?on of this Court: that seeing both reason and some experience had taught that officers did more regard, and labor more to advance their owne Tenant? by whome they were mayntayned, then those of the Companies: whither it were not fitting for prevention thereof hereafter to reduce and cast into the number of the publique those Tenant? [216] that belong to the Gouernor, or any other officer, and out of the whole proffit? belonging to the Company to propocon the said officers the same allowance ratably according to the number of their Tenant?: conceaving it to be very probable that this Course, if any will stirr them vpp to a more serious regard and care of advanc- ing the publick seeing their own private interest and Co?oditye was therein involued. Wch mo?on this Court conceavinge it to be of speciall importance thought fitt to referr it to the further considera?on and determina?on of the Counsell.

But in regard of the extraordinary well deservinge of Sr Edwyn Sandys and his Continuall constant endeavors: both before and in the time of his gouerment and since to vphold and advance the Planta?on by his industry care and providence the Company thought fitt now in his absence especially, to shewe some testimony of their loue and thanke- fullnes though no wayes able to gratifie his paines in that ample meas- ure as he had deserued, by bestowing 20: shares of land vpon him for the present till better meanes accrue yt might enhable the Company to be further thankefull vnto him: wch 20: shares being put to the question were by a Generall Consent ratified and confirmed. 20: Shares be- stowed on Sr Ed- wyn Sandys. ffor somuch as it hath been obsrved that the alienating and selling shares of land at an vnder value as comonly men do for 40: or 50s: did not onely defraud the treasury of much money that would come vpon an orderly purchase thereof from the Company but did also exceedingly sleight &amp; disesteeme the free and honoble bounty of this Court, and in a manner embace the Virginia Soyle: and besides not a little discour- age such as had paid in their 12li 10s for every single share; ffor ?venting whereof it was therfore moved that ye Court would please in bestowing shares ?of land hereafter? vpon merrite: to graunt it wth [219] such lymita?ons, as no man may have liberty to sell, or transfer his shares to any other for any considera?on whatsoever vnles the Comittee appointed for distribu?on of shares should be moved vpon some speciall reasons to give way therevnto: wherevpon the Court ordered that from this daye forward all shares of land given by the Company, shalbe lymited vnder the former Caution, vnles the said Co?ittee shall thinke otherwise thinke fitt to allowe thereof.

Concerning mr Deputies Account he shewed that whereas he had receaved divers Su?es of money of his Lop to be disbursed by him and the Comittees in making provisions of all sort? for divers Shipps and people this yeare sent to Virginia, he was not able at this Court to give vp a perfect Account of all ye ?ticulars to the finishing of it: In reguard that himsellfe and the Co?ittees for the more speedy dispatch of the said Shipps and people formerly sent had bought divers sort? of provisions vpon their Credditt? hoping to have receaved money ere this time from mr Barbor for clearing those debt? whereby his Account might have been ?served against this Quarter Court. mr: Deputies re- port concrning his Account. But the soddaine suppressing of Lotteries have caused that money [220] came not in as they expected: And for so much as the Com- panies Stock lyeth now altogeather in Plate and therfore was not so presently able to be turned into money wthout to great losse but hoped that it would be by the next Quarter Court wch would be about five week? hence: for these reasons he did humbly entreate this Court that they would be pleased to respite this Account till the next moneys were receaved for the paying of such debt? as were to be discharged vpon the last yeares Account wch the Court thought very reasonable.1 1 The Order in Council and the Proclamation of the King suspending the lotteries are mentioned in List of Records, Nos. 231, 233, page 146, ante. Touching Sr: Edwyn Sandys Account he likewise declared that in his absence he was to signify vnto them that whereas Sr Edwyn at the giving vp of his place, stood bound for the Company for certaine Su?es of money wch were ordered to be paid vnto him for discharge of the fraight of divers shipps and other thing?: wch Shipps for somuch as all of them are not yett returned but daily expected, he therfore desired his Accts: might likewise be respited till the next Quarter Court after this by wch time he hopeth the Shipp will be returned, whereby he might discharge her according to the Contract, as he had well and carefully donn all others for wch he stood ingaged wch mo?on was like- wise thought very reasonable and of necessity to be graunted.

After these buisinesses were thus ordered and the day farr spent, it was moved that seeing my Lo: of Southampton was not yet come, they might notwthstanding proceed to the elec?on of their newe Treasuror for the yeare ensueinge: wch mo?on being agreed vnto and my Lo: of Southampton onely proposed for elec?on his Lop: was forthwth ballated according to order [221] and thereby chosen with a full and generall consent of the whole Courte (as appeared by the Balls there being not one against yt) to continue and hold the said place of Treasuror for the ensuing yeare whereof his Lop: being advertized at his Cominge, and of the humble and earnest request of the whole Court to that purpose, was pleased to accept of their willing choise in very noble mañer excusing his remisse coming to their Court? the yeare past, as allso the occasion of his longe stay this daye at Parliamt: wch the Court did not onely signify their readines to dis- pence wth, but rendered also to his Lop: the greatest thank? that pos- siblie they could for his honoble: care and paines and endeavors to vphold and advance the Planta?on ever since his happy entrance into this place of gouermt.

After this his Lpp according to the standing orders of the Company deliu9ed into the Court a booke of his Account? for the yeare past examined &amp; approved vnder the Auditors hand?, as allso the number of the Supplies of people sent to Virginia the same yeare. But touch- ing the present State of the Cashe his Lop said he could give them as yet no Account: because the State was now already in Plate wch required some longer time to be converted into money. A booke of my Lo: Account. Sr Edwyn Sandys signified vnto the Company that whereas to their great care and Cost of at least 4000li: they had heretofore given direc- ?on for the setting vp of certain Iron work? in Virginia and to that end ?cured skillfull workemen for making of Iron they had receaved credible informa?on that three of their mr workemen were dead: In supply of whome, because the hope of that Co?oditie alone is very great having already receaved a good proofe thereof by Iron sent from thence they have already sent three other skillfull workemen to advance againe the said worke, and now it was their good happ to light vpon a fourth gent (named mr Iohn Berkly who in the iudgement of those that knewe him well was helld to be very sufficient that waye) who did now offer himsellf to goe vpon the said service and carry over wth him 20 principall workemen well experienced in those kinde of [222] work? wherevpon the Court thought fitt that the Com- ittees hereafter named or any five of them should treate * * * and conclude wth the said mr Berkly and likewise wth his Sonne being desirous to goe over wth his said father touching their demaund? for performance of the said service. mr Io: Berkly co?ended for Iron workes.

My Lo: of Southampton signified vnto the Company that although the number of his Mats: Counsell for Virginia was already very great: yet in regard the most part of them were such eminent persons of State as could not afford their present? so often as they might have oc?asion; he therfore thought it very expedient and necessary to make such ?some? addi?on of such as had not only approved their sufficiency and worth vnto the Company: but were like to give more diligent attend- ance at their Court? ?and? in a manner be at hand vpon all occasions of service and therewth all presented the names of eight Gent: wch his Lop. co?ended to their good approba?on vizt Sr Phil: Carey. mr Edw: Harbert.

Att this Reporte the Court remained much greiued and conceauinge it a matter of greater importance and difficulty then to admitt any present delibera?on espeacially of so fewe they were resolued that the buissines should be reserued entire for the Preparatiue and Quarter Court? to take into their graue considera?ons howe the Companie should proceed between two such extreame difficulties as their llps. co?aund and the vtter dis- hartninge of all both Aduenturers and Planters. mr Deputy gaue notice of ye Lord?

      <field name="fulltext">At a Meetinge of the Co?ittee on Thursday §Tuisday§ the 30: Octob: i621 Present Present mr Deputy. mr Ayres. mr Gibbs. mr Nich: ffarrar. mr Wrote. mr Robert?. The said Co?ittee meetinge this Afternoone to treat with mr Cop- land touchinge the dispose of the money giuen by some of the East Indy Companie that came with him in the Royall Iames to be bestowed vpon some good worke for the benifitt of the Planta?on in Virginia, the said mr Copland beinge nowe present did deliuer in a note of the names of those that had freely and willingly contributed their moneyes herevnto, wch money mr Copland said they desired might be imployed toward? the buildinge either of a Church or Schoole in Virginia (wch the Companie should thinke fitt). And that although this So?e of money was but a smale propor?on to ?forme so great a worke, yet mr Copland said he doubted not, but to ?swade the East Indy Companie (whome he meant to solicite), to make some Addi?on therevnto, besid? he said that he had very effectually writt (the Coppie of wch letter he shewed and was read) to diuers ffactories in the East Indies to stirr them vp to the like contribu?on toward? the ?formance of this pious worke as they had already donne for the buildinge of a Church at Wappinge where by his Report they haue giuen about 400li. It beinge therefore nowe taken into considera?on whither a Church or a Schoole was most necessarie and might nearest agree to the inten- ?ons of the Donors: It was conceaued that for somuch as each ?ticu- ler Planta?on aswell as the generall either had or ought to haue a Church appropriated vnto them, there was therefore a greater want of a Schoole then of Churches:As also for that it [276] was impos- sible with so smale a propor?on to compasse so great a charge as the buildinge of a Church would require, they therefore conceaued it most fitt to resolue for the erectinge of a publique free schoole wch beinge for the educa?on of Children and groundinge of them in the principles of religion Ciuility of life and humane learninge serued to carry with it the greatest waight and highest consequence vnto the Planta?ons as that whereof both Church and co?onwealth take their originall foun- da?on and happie estate, this beinge also like to proue a worke most acceptable vnto the Planters, through want whereof they haue bin hitherto constrained to their great cost? to send their Children from thence hither to be taught. Secondly it was thought fitt that this schoole should be placed in one of the fower Citties and they conceaued that Charles Citty, of the fower did affoord the most convenient place for that purpose as well in respect it matcheth with the best in holesomnes of Aire, as also for the comodious scitua?on thereof, beinge not farr distant from Henrico and other perticuler Planta?ons. It was also thought fitt that in honor of the East Indy Benefactors, the same should be called the East Indy Schoole who shall haue pre- cedence before any other to preferr their Children thither to be brought vp in the rudiment? of learninge; It was also thought fitt that this as a Collegiate or free schoole should haue dependance vpon the Colledge in Virginia wch should be made capable to receaue Schollers from the Shoole into such Scollershipps and fellowshipps as the said Colledge shalbe endowed withall for the aduancement of schollers as they arise by degres and deserts in learninge. That for the better mayntenance of the Scholemr and Vsher intended there to be placed it was thought fitt that it should be moued at the next Quarter Cort that 1000 acres of land should be allotted vnto the said Scolle, and that 5 ?sons besid? an ouerseer of them should be forthwith ?sent? vpon this charg in the condi?on of Apprentices to manure and cultiuate the said land, and that ouer and aboue this allowance of land and Tenant? vnto the Schoolemr, such as sent their Children to this Schoole should giue some benevolence vnto the scoolemr for the better encrease of his mayntenance That it should be speacially recomended to the Gouernor to take care that the Planters there be stirred vp to put their helpinge hand? toward? the speedy buildinge of the said Schoole in respect [277] their Children are like to receaue the greatest benifitt thereby in their educa?on: And to let them knowe that those that exceed others in their bounty and Assistance herevnto shalbe priuiledged with the preferment of their Children to the said Schoole before others that shalbe found lesse worthie. It is likewise thought fitt that a good Schoolemr be prouided forthwith to be sent vnto this Scoole. It was also informed by a gentleman of this Co?ittee that he knewe one that desired not to be named that would bestowe 30li to be added to the former Some of 70li to make it vp 100li toward? the buildinge of the said schoole: This report beinge read was well approued of and thought fitt to be referred for confirma?on to the next Quartr Court. Mr Copland beinge formerly entreated to knowe what acquittance mr Landman did desire for payment of the said 70li left in his hands to be deliuered to this Companie did nowe report that mr Lanman said he would take his direc?on herein from the East Indy Compã at their next meetinge, Notwithstandinge it was thought fitt, that offer should be made to mr Lanman to secure them §him§ vnder the Coun- sells seale for payment of the said money to mr Deputy. Mr Wrote in discharge of his former promise did nowe give an Account vnto the Court what he had donn for findinge out to whose hand? the Collec?on gathered money ?gathered? in Norff. and Suff. was paid whereof he said he was promised a ?ticuler so as he shalbe able to let them knowe verie shortly where and in whose hand? the said Money resteth and well doe his best endeauor to solicite that it may be paid in: And therefore did entreat those gentlemen that did vndertake for solicitinge the rest of the Bishopps for moneyes remayninge in their hand? vpon collec?ons would nowe be pleased to giue an Account vnto the Companie of what they had donn therein. Vpon the humble peti?on of mr Anthony Gosnold gentleman it is agreed and ordered first that he shall haue two shares of land in Virginia, due vnto him for the aduenture of 25li in money paid into the Treasury to Sr Thomas Smith as by his bill nowe shewed by him in Court ?vnder the Companies Seale? though it were not sett downe in the printed booke vnder the Companies Seale may appeare And secondly that he shall haue one share of land more wch of right also belongeth vnto him for his ?sonall Aduenture to Virginia some 16 yeares since vpon his owne charge. [278] Thirdly whereas the said mr Gosnold alledgeth he had two kinsemen that died longe since seized of land in Virginia who by their last will gaue him their said land: It is likewise ordered that it shalbe reco?- ended to the Gouernor to take order that upon due proufe made thereof, he do him iustice, lastly touchinge the merritt of his ?son in reguard of his longe and hard seruice for many yeares together in the condi?on of a Servant, notwithstandinge he ought to haue bin free: The Court hath referred him to the Co?ittee appointed for reward- inge men vpon their good deserving?. It beinge likewise moued that for somuch as diuers worthie gen? desired to be mr Gosnold? Associat? intendinge at their owne charge to trans- port 100 ?sons to Virginia there to plant and inhabite that therefore the said mr Gosnold might haue a Patent for ?ticuler Planta?on wch was accordingly graunted and ordered to be drawne vp against the next Quarter Court. Vpon the request yt the said mr Gosnold might passe ouer two of his Shares formerly allowed vpon his Bill of Aduenture the one to his Brother Robert Gosnold esquire the other to mr Roger Castle of Ramingham in Norff gen?: The Court did well approue of thereof and confirmed vnto each of them a single share as aforesaid. Mr Caswell moued that forsomuch as himselfe and some others of the Co?ittee stood bound for the freight of the Bona Noua that the Com- panie would please by order of this Court to giue warrant to mr Bull for payment of 300li in discharge of the said Bond, wch the Court did generally agree vnto and ordered that a warrant vnto mr Bull should be drawne for payment thereof accordingly neuertheles vpon mr Bull? mo?on it was also ordered and prouided that if in case so much should not be found due vnto the Companie vpon the ?fectinge of the Account? that then the Ouerplus should be repaide againe vnto mr Bull. Mr Woodall stood suspended by order of a Court the 18: Iuly i620 from cominge to Court? till the Quarter Court followinge to wch he was referred for censure, for that he had mistermed the printed Publication and rashly spoken against Sr Edwin Sandys for somuch as he did nowe humbly acknowledge his said fault and shewed him- selfe so exceedinge penitent and scornfull ?sorrowfull? for the same and wthall desired pardon of this Court The Companie seemed to like well of this his acknowledgment and submission. [279] Mr Deputy informed the Companie of the great paines that mr Bon- nell the ffrenchman, Mr of the King? Silkwormes at Oatland had taken in peñinge a Treatise in ffrench concerninge the orderinge of Silkwormes and makinge of Silke, wch treatise for that it might be of speciall vse vnto the Planters in Virginia, he therefore moued this Court would please to reco?end it, to some to translate it into Eng- lish and afterward that it might be ?vsed and beinge approued it might be printed, wch the Court assented vnto, and praid mr Deputy to see it donne, and that a good number of the said Book? might be sent vnto the Colony in Virginia by the next Shippe that goes. Capt1 1 Written over mr. Henry ffortescue Vncle and Administrator of the good? and Chattells of Symond ffortescue who died intestate at Sea at his returne for England from Virginia, moued, that forsomuch as he cannot him- selfe goe to Virginia to recouer such land? good? and Debt?: as are due vnto the said Symond ffortescue deceased whereof Sr George Yeard- ley stands indebted 250li that it would therefore please this Honoble Court to write to the Gouernor to informe himselfe of the ?sonall estate of the said Symond ffortescue and to afford his Kindred and frend? all lawfull fauor and Assistance for recouery of the said ffor- tescues land? good? and Debt? The Court conceaued this mo?on to be verie reasonable and therefore ordered that direc?on shalbe giuen to the Gouernor of Virginia to take such order in the premises as may be most agreeable to equity and good conscience. Elizabeth Smalley Widdowe hauinge peti?oned to the Kinge against Captaine Argall pretendinge that he deteyned certaine good? from her to the value of 500li, and beinge referred by his Matie to his High- nes Counsell for Virginia did nowe peti?on to the Companie to take hearinge of the said cause accordinge to his Mats Referrence, where- vpon the Counsell agreed to meete vpon friday followinge in the Afternoone about two of the Clocke at mr ffarrars howse against wch time order is nowe giuen for warninge both the said Widdowe Smalley and Capt: Argall to make their appearance as also all such Wittnesses as could be ?duced on the behalfe of the said Complaynant. [280] Mrs Allice Bohune Widdowe late wife of Dor Bohuñe peti?oned vnto the Companie that forsomuch §as§ her said Husband in his life time was at great charge as shee supposeth for the prouidinge furnishinge and transportinge of Servant? into Virginia that the Companie would please to allowe her some Annuall contribu?on as also to release and free her sonne Edwards Barnes from his seauen yeares seruice where- vnto he is tyed contrary to his meaninge and her expecta?on: But answeare was made that shee was misinformed for that the Companie and not Dor Bohune were at all the said cost and charges and for that her sonn was the Companies Servaunt, he was to serue out his yeares and might not be sett at liberty. Vpon the humble request of mr Rider that mr Ro: Taylor whome he reported to be a gentleman of good quality nowe in Virginia might be sett at liberty and made free: The Court is pleased to graunt him his freedome, vpon condi?on he paye the Companie for the charge of his passage and whatsoeuer other charge they haue bin at for his beinge there. Mr Robert Staples a Minister co?ended much by mr Abraham Cham- berlen and by Certificate from many Diuines resident in this Citty reportinge him to be of honest conversa?on and a good Scholler: beinge desirous to goe to Virginia did nowe make request, that the Companie would please to entertaine him for their Minister there. But the Companie wantinge meanes to furnish him out did moue that some of the ?ticuler Planta?ons would imploy him: Wherevpon mr Darnelly signified that he thought that they of Mar- tins Hundred wanted a Minister to whome he was recomended.

Mr Deputy acquainted the Companie that at the end of the last Su?er Ilands Court held the seauenth of this present Moneth there came a letter vnto his hand? from an vnknowne person directed vnto him and the rest of the Counsell and Compã for Virginia, wch letter, for that many of the Virginia Compã ?were then ?sent? he caused to be opened and read, the Contents whereof are as followeth. A Letter dated the 7o of Nouember i621 directed to mr Deputy ffarrar and to the rest of the Counsell and Companie for Virginia You shall receaue here enclosed 40s for a sermon to be preached before the Vir- ginia Companie this Michalmas Terme and before the Quarter Court day: The place I leaue to ye Companies appointement, Also I desire that mr Damport may preach the first sermon if the Companie approue hereof: I will if God permit make a perpetuity in this kinde: So beseechinge your good acceptance of this smale mite, as also that you mr Deputy performe yor promise in con- cealinge my name I take my leaue and rest a daylie orator for Virginia. [282] This letter beinge read and the Companie then present demaunded on what day they would haue this Sermon preached, it was then agreed to haue it vpon this day before the Virginia Companie and after ser- mon it was also vpon mo?on agreed to suppe together, mr Gibbs beinge entreated to giue notice hereof to mr Damport accordingly. Nowe forsomuch as it further appeareth by the said Letter that the Author of this Guift hath promised vpon the Companies good acceptance hereof to make a ?petuity of this kinde, mr Deputy therefore moued that this Court would please to reco?end it to the next Quarter Court to appoint on what daye hereafter this yearely exercise shalbe ?formed wch mo?on the Court did well approue of and accordingly referred it to the iudgement of the Quarter Court to order it, and in the mean time entreated mr Deputy whoe knewe the gentleman to signifie the Companies espeaciall thank? vnto him. Whereas in reguard of the great seruice wch mr Io Pountis hath per- formed in Virginia for the generall good of the Plantation as also in respect of his worth and sufficiency otherwise the Court was pleased the 10th of Iuly last to conferr vpon him the place of Vice admirall prouisionally for one yeare as by his Comission bearinge date the 24th of the same Moneth may appeare and that with a further promise that his Comission. should be recomended to the next Quarter Court to be confirmed it was therefore nowe moued that accordingly his Comis- sion might be then ratified and that in the meanetime the said Office of Vice admirall might be stated with a competent propor?on of land and Tenant? wch may mainetaine them for the present vntill some other Accrues incident to that office shalbe allotted him. The Court did verie well approue of this mo?on and praid Sr Io Dauers Sr Phil- lep Carey mr Gibbs, mr Wrote mr Io Smith mr Nicho: ffarrar mr Ber- blocke to meet the next daye at two of the Clocke in the Afternoone to state the said place with such allowances as they shall thinke fitt. In treatinge of these buissinesses mr Hawes takinge notice of the Com- panies purpose to entertaine mr Iohn Pountis into their seruice moued that whereas certaine priuate men had aduentured the Some of 10 1800li in a ioynt Stocke for transportinge of men and diuers goods for a ffishinge voyage in the yeare i618 ouer wch the said mr Pountis had charge &amp; gouermt moued yt forsomuch as it seemed the Companie intended to imploye the said mr Pountis in their seruice that they would please in considera?on hereof §to giue§ the said priuate Aduen- turers send greater ?por?on of land for the 25 men formerly sent ouer [283] As also some considera?on for the good? remayninge whereof the Companie might make good vse. Touchinge the first aunsweare was made that the Companie did not conceaue mr Pountis to be any way engaged vnto them but rather had receaued much preiv- dice by their failinge him of their promised Supplies whereby he could effect nothinge for want of meanes, where it did appeare he was so much dishartned as it made him put on a resolu?on to come home for England had not the Companie given him some encouragmt to stay by conferringe this place vpon him as also the managinge of some other buissines, As for such goods of thers as yet remayned, It was lawfull and free for them to make their best markett? whereby there could be no great losse. Mr Deputy signified that he was to moue the Court for graunt of three seuerall Patent? for perticuler Planta?ons vnto such as would vnder- take to transport at their owne charge one hundred ?sons a peece to Virginia the first for Sr Charles North, the second for mr Crowe, the Third for mr Leninge, wch seuerall Patent? the Cort gaue order for drawinge them vp in that vsuall forme against the Quarter Court Whereas in drawinge vp the Patent? for Sr Richard Worsly and his Associat? there was a mistake in settinge downe of Anthony Ienings for Abraham it was moued that error might be amended at the next Court wch was graunted. It was ordered by consent of the Aduenturers of the old magazine that mr Abraham Chamberlen shall take vp as much money here as appeareth by the Account of Iohn De Clarke to be due to the old Magazine and remaine in his hand? and paye the same ouer to mr Richard Bull that a diuident may be made to the Aduenturers.

Mr Churchill Moone of the Middle Temple in London gentleman hau- inge eight shares of land in Virginia allowed by the Auditors did vpon request passe them ouer wth approba?on of this Court in manner fol- lowinge vizt: he assigned 4 of them vnto mr Charles Cratford of the midle Temple in London esqr.

Vpon readinge of the former Court? mr Deputy acquainted the Com- panie with what the Co?ittee appointed by the said Court had donn concerninge the Statinge of the Vice admiralls place in Virginia, who in considera?on of the quality of the place haue thought fitt that 300 acres of land be allotted vnto the said Office; and that the number of 12 Tenant? be placed therevpon for the cultiuatinge thereof and did also thinke fitt that this land should be laid out neare Iames Citty as fittest for the Vice admirall? residence in reguard of the first arriuall of Shipps there: mr Deputy therefore moued to knowe the Companies approba?on hereof and beinge desired to put it seuerally to the ques- tion, the Court approued of the matter of allowance but differed in opinion in the choise of the place, where this land should be sett out, and that they rather thought fitt it should be co?ended to the care of the Gouernor to appoint the same. [285] Forsomuch as mr Io. Pountis was elected Viceadmirall of Virginia by a generall Court held the 10th of Iuly last, and was also authorised by Co?ission to execute the said Office prouisionally for one yeare vntill the said Co?ission might be further confirmed vnto him by the next Quarter Court; mr Deputy therefore moued to knowe the Companies pleasure herein for his longer continuance: Whereupon the Court agreed both in reguard of his sufficiency and generall good report and esteeme amonge the Planters, as also in reward of his seruice and carefull endeauors to aduance the publique, that this Co?ission should be continued for three yeares and therefore referred it to the Quarter Court for confirma?on. Whereas the Co?ittee appointed to treat with mr Copland about the buildinge of the East India Church or Schoole, in Virginia towards wch a Contribu?on of 70li was freely giuen by some of the East Indy Company that came home in the Royall Iames did nowe make report what speciall reasons moued them to resolue for the bestowinge that money toward? the erectinge of a Schoole rather then a Church wch report is at large sett downe at a Court held the last of October: And further that they had allotted 1000 acres of land and fiue Apprentices besid? an Ouerseer to manure it, besid? that beneuolence that is hoped wilbe giuen by each man that send? his Children thither to be taught for the Schoolemr mayntenance in his first begiñinge: with ?wch? allow- ance of land and Tenant? beinge put to the question was well aproued of and referred for confirma?on to the Quarter Court Prouided that in the establishment hereof the Companie reserue vnto themselues power to make lawes and orders for the better gouerment of the said Schoole and the Revenues and proffitt? that shall therevnto belong. It was further moued that in respect mr Copland Minister hath bin a chiefe cause of procuringe this former contribu?on to be giuen by the aforesaid Companie and had also writt diuers Letters to many ffacto- ries in the Eart Indies to moue them to follow their good example for the better aduancemt of this pious worke that therefore the Companie would please to gratifie him with some propor?on of land: Where- vpon the Court takinge it into considera?on and beinge also informed yt mr Copland was furnishing out certen ?sons to be transported this present voyage to plant and inhabite vpon such land as should be granted vnto him by the Com?anie they were the rather induced to bestowe vpon him an extraordinary gratifica?on of three Shares of land old Aduenture wch is 300 acres vpon a first diuision wth out payinge rent to the Companie referringe the further ratifica?on of the said guift to the Quarter Court as also his admittance of beinge a free Brother of this Company. Whereas diuers Patent? formerly appointed to be engrossed were nowe presented to be read: It was thought fitt in reguard the after- noone was farr spent to reserue the readinge of them till the next Wedensday morninge at wch time it is agreed the Quarter Court shall beginn. [286] Mr Deputy moued for order to drawe vp certen Co?issions for diuers Shipps that intended to goe for ffish and trade after they had deliu- ered their Passengers and good? in Virginia: Wherevpon order was giuen to prepare the said Co?issions ready against the next Quarter Court. Mr Waterhouse presented vnto the considera?on of this Court certen Propositions for the better ?formance of the seruice he was to vnder- take for collectinge the moneys due from Noble men and gentlemen vpon subscription: The Court conceaued them to be verie reasonable saue in the matter of allowance for his paines, for wch they rather desired mr Waterhowse would stand to their curteousie wth wch he was contented, So that he might out of his Receipts from time to time be ?mitted to take allowance for defrayinge of necessary charges for himselfe his man and two horses, wch the Companie assented vnto so that his said Charge exceeded not 50s a weeke, and that accordinge to his promise he doe present his Account a weeke before euery Quarter Court and giue Security of 500li, for such money as shall come to his hand? in the interim. And also that he take his direc ?ons for the better managinge of the buissines from the Companie, and acquainte them from time to time into what part? he will bend his course to solicite in this buissines. It was moued that whereas many bill? of Aduenture were from time to time presented to the Court wch were found to be o?itted in the printed publica?on that here after a booke of purpose might be kept to register the said names alphabettically for the ready findinge of them vpon any occasions wch mo?on was well approued of and order giuen to the Secretary to see it donne vnto whome all such bill? are to be presented that he may take the better notice of them. It was also moued that such shares as were passed ouer from one from another might be registred alphabettically in a booke wch was also well approued. It was further moued that whereas since the printed publica?on many orders were established in Quarter Court? that did binde the Com- panie no lesse then the standinge lawes themselues that therefore the aforesaid Corts might be carefully ?vsed and Collee?on made of all such bindinge orders wch being further ratified might be added to the rest of the lawes in the printed booke. [287] It beinge signified that mr Essington beinge made acquainted with the order of the last Court held the 4th of this present Moneth touch- inge the auditinge of the Account? remayninge in his hand? and the makinge of warrant? to mr Richard Bull to paye what shall appeare to be due to euery man, (the brok? for non payment? at due times beinge allowed accordinge to the orders of the Magazine) wch order for that it was not somewhat doubtfull and not clearely expressed in this last order of Court, he desired the same might be so farr explained as the time may be ?emtorily sett downe when the brok? shall begin: Wherefore it was agreed that accordinge to the said former order the Brok? vpon defalt of the first payment shall beginn at Bartholmewe tyde, and for default of the other payment? appointed to be made in Easter and Mic?as Termes the allowance for brok? shall begin at the end of those Termes and so forward till this present daye and to ruñ at 20 p Centum whereof the Auditors were desired to take notice and to proceed accordingly. Captaine Martin ?hauinge? peti?oned to the Court for redresse of certaine greivances whereof he complained was admonished that if he would willingly surrender his Patent wch had so often been ques- tioned and complained of both here and by the Counsell in Virginia in reguard of the vnlawfull priuiledges passed therein directly repug- nant to the standinge lawes of the Companie since that time made (wch requires all graunt of land? to be made with equall fauor except the differency of rent) that then he should not only haue a newe Patent as large as any but further the Companie would be ready to affoord him, all the fauor, and Assistance that in reason or iustice he could expect, notwithstandinge this admoni?on Capt Martin refused to surrender his said Patent, and said he would exhibite his peti?on vnto the next Court and stand to the iudgement and censure of that Honoble: Assembly touchinge the priuiledges of his said Patent.

Sr Edwin Sandys. Sr Iohn Dãuers. [290] And whereas it was then thought fitt and desired that a publi? Decla- ra?on might be made as well to the Companie of London as to all other Citties and Townes of this Kingdome that haue aduentured any So?es of mony toward? the Planta?on in Virginia to let them knowe what propor?ons of land belong? vnto them in respect of their said Aduen- tures and what proffitt? they may make thereof by plantinge good and staple Comodities, as also what the perticuler charge of transportinge people and prouisions thither wilbe vnto them It beinge formerly referred to a select Co?ittee vizt. Sr Edwin Sandys. mr Wrote. Sr Io: Dãuers. mr Cranmer. mr Deputy ffarrar. mr Berblocke. mr Io: Smith. mr Secr? Dauison. mr Gibbs. They are nowe againe entreated to take some paines in drawinge vp of the said Publica?on that such as haue bin Aduenturers may be stirred vp to plant their land, wchwilbe to the great aduancement of the generall Planta?on aswell as their owne priuate benifitt. Mr Deputy signified that the Auditors accordinge to the order of the Quarter Court in Iune last had made a true and perfect Account of all such so?es of money as haue bin receaued by the benifitt of the Runinge Lotteries, and had also in the said Account? declared the vses wherevpon the said moneyes haue bin expended from time to time for the aduancement of the Planta?on, wch Account? they had accordinge to the direc?on of the said Court presented in all humble Duetie and thankefullnes vnto his Matie. The whole Court So?e of wch Account amounted to about 29000li as may appeare, though it was by diuers reported to haue bin a farr greater So?e. Hee further signified that mr Barbor hauinge had his Account? ?ticu- lerly examined by the Auditors touchinge his receipt? by the said Lot- teries who audited the same the last Terme and allowed thereof for wch he was then to haue had his Quietus est, mr Deputy therefore moued that he might nowe haue it at this Quarter Court, but mr Barbor rather desired that his Quietus est might be respited till the next Quarter Court and that in the meane while his book? of Account? might euery Cort day be brought in and laid vpon the Table to be veiwed and ?vsed and excepted against if any error could be found, but if no exception in the meane while could be taken thereat he praid he might then haue his Quietus est. Whereas the Companie had formerly contracted with Captaine Norton for settinge vp of a glasse furnace in Virginia to make glasse and bead? (as by the ?ticulers of the said Contract more at large may appeare) It was nowe declared that for somuch as the Charge of fur- nishinge out the said Capt Norton (when it came to be ?ticulerly examined) did farr exceed that propor?on wch he had before proposed to the Companie insomuch as the Co?on Stocke beinge altogether exhausted was no way able to ?forme the same, So that this great worke whereof the Companie had conceaued so good a hope was like to haue fallen to nothinge for want of sufficient meanes [291] to goe forward with it, for wch cause the Company hauinge giuen it ouer it pleased certen priuate Aduenturers to vphold the same and therevpon entertayned the bargaine made with Capt: Norton and the Italians vpon like condi?ons as the Companie had Donn, and yet beinge unwil- linge to exclude ye Companie from a buissines so much concerninge them they did agree they should ioyne wth them in a fourth ?t of ye Charge and so ?take a 4th of ye benefitt that should any waies accrue thereby In considera?on whereof as also for their better encouragemt the said Aduenturers moued that the Companie would please to bestowe amongst them all the land? that should be due for transpor- ta?on of people sent thither to be imployed vpon the said worke, wch mo?on the Court conceaued to be verie reasonable and fitt to be graunted in respect of the great charge they haue and must still be at in prosecu?on thereof, beinge therefore put to the question the Court confirmed the same vnto them. Mr Deputy signified that whereas it pleased the Companie to rest the exhibiting of his Account? till this Quarter Court in respect that moneyes were not then ready to discharge those debt? wch he and some others stood engaged for for many kind? of prouisions taken vp for the vse and seruice of the Company yet hauinge nowe satisfied a good ?t of the said Debt? (so as there remayned onely but 100li for the Companie to paye) he thought good to present his Account as it was though not fully perfited that they might be acquainted with the State thereof and so leaue it to their pleasure for the auditinge of it, but the Court conceaued it more convenient to respit the same till the next Quartr Court, hopinge by that time sufficient meanes would come in to the full finishing of his Account. Concerninge Sr Edwin Sandys Account mr Deputy signified that he would err longe be here himselfe to present the same vnto them, when he doubted §not§ but he would giue the Companie good satisfac?on. The Co?ittee appointed by the former Court hauinge taken into con- sidera?on what propor?on of allowance they conceaued to be neces- sarie for the present support and mayntenance of a Vice admirall in Virginia whereof they conceaued there was a verie great necessity and that the want of such an Officer haue bin no smale losse and preiudice vnto the Companies Shipps and prouisions and other pub- lique seruice haue thought fitt in respect of the quality of the place to state the same wth 300 acres of land and the number of 12 Tenant? to be placed therevpon for the plantinge and cultiuatinge thereof wch allowances were thought verie reasonable and therevpon beinge put to the question were ratified and confirmed. And for somuch as mr Io: Pountis was espeacially recomended for the said place of Vice admirall in respect of his sufficiency and continuall reguard of the publique good §&amp;§ of the Companies direc?ons (in considera?on whereof he was by a former Court chosen to execute the said place by Co?ission prouisionally for one yeare vntill it might be further confirmed vnto him by order of a Quartr Court) It is therefore nowe agreed and ordered that the said Io: Pountis shall continue in the place of Viceadmirall for three yeares begiñing from the date of these present?. [292] Whereas there was a contribu?on of 70li freely giuen by certaine gen- tlemen and Marriners of the East India Companie yt came home in the Royall Iames wch they desired might be imployed toward? the buildinge either of an East Indy Church or Schoole in Virginia at the Choise of the Virginia Companie: Wherevpon it beinge referred to a Co?ittee and by them taken into considera?on they did nowe certifie that many important reasons had moued them to agree in opinion yt the said moneyes were fitt to be imployed for the buildinge of a free Schoole in Virginia wch they likewise thought fitt should be called the East Indy Schoole in honor of the said Benefactors they also signified further that an vnknowne person out of a zealous affec?on to aduance so pious a worke had giuen 30li more, both wch So?es were nowe brought into the Court and laid vpon the Table It was also further declared in the report of the said Co?ittee beinge entred at large in the Court held the last of october that they thought fitt for the mayn- tenance of the said Schoolemr and his Vsher to be placed in the said Schoole to allowe no lesse then 1000 acres of land and fiue ?sons besid? and Ouerseer of them wch they thought fitt should be forthwith sent vpon this former charge (in condi?on of Apprentices) to manure and cultiuate the said lands, wch allowance of land and Servant? beinge intended for this as a Collegiate Schoole, the Court conceaued to be verie reasonable and therevpon beinge put to the question were accordingly confirmed. fforsomuch as it was also informed that mr Copland was a good meanes by his owne example to moue the aforesaid Companie to giue that contribucon of 70li beinge Preacher in the said Shippe and had further allso writt to diuers ffactories in the East Indies to stirr them vp to the like charitable contribu?on toward? this pious worke: It was there- fore thought fitt and ordered that the said mr Copland by waye of gratifica?on should haue 3 shares old Aduenture bestowed vpon him as a free guifte and should also be admitted a free Brother of the Company. It was likewise moued that the Companie would please to ad?itt mr Balmeford into their Society in respect he had deserued so well by his often attendance at Court? and readynes to doe the Companie seruice, ffor wch cause the Court hath made him free and do intreat his accus- tomed paines and attendance in the seruice of the Companie. Mr Waterhowse beinge formerly chosen and appointed to collect the moneyes from such as are indebted to the Company vpon subscriptions, hauinge nowe presented his Propositions and agreemts made with the appointed Co?ittee who thought fitt to allowe him 50s a weeke for his rydinge charges duringe his imployment to be taken out of his receipt? from time to time and that a further considera?on should be had of his paines and trauell herein, wth wch mr Waterhowse was contented and promised to solicite the Bisps that were behinde gratis: The Court there- fore takinge the said allowances into their considera?on did well aproue thereof and beinge put to the question confirmed the same vnto him promisinge to deale liberally with him vpon discharge of that [293] buissines, and further also for his better encouragement in so good a worke as he hath vndertaken they haue admitted him to be a free Brother of the Companie: And touchinge his Comission wch he is to haue under the Companies Seale whereby to authorise him to collect the said moneyes the Court hath referred it to Sr Iohn Dauers assisted with any fower other of the Counsell to drawe the same vp and beinge accordingly engrossed they haue authorized mr Deputy to seale it with the legall Seale. Intelligence was giuen that my Lord Bp: of Rochester beinge solicited for the moneys remayninge in his hand? vnto the Companie vpon Collec?on made in his lps Diocesse hath paid in the Some of 20li to be imployed toward? the buildinge of the Colledge in Virginia. Whereas Captaine Martin preferred a peti?on to the Preparatiue Court complayninge of diuers greivances wch he desired the Companie to take into their considera?ons, an offer was made vnto him that if he would surrender his old Patent wch had bin so often questioned and complained of both by the Companie here and by the Gouernor and Counsell of State in Virginia in respect of the vnlawfull priuiledges therein; directly contradictinge the standing orders of the Companie wch required all Patent? to be made alike wth equall fauor (exceptinge the difference of Rent) vnto all, he should then not only haue a newe Patent in as large and ample manner as any other whatsoeuer but should also haue what further fauor and assistance for redresse of his said greiuances, as the Companie in equity could afford him, notwith- standinge this admoni?on and faire offer Capt: Martin refused to drawe deliuer vp his said Patent sayinge that he would peti?on to the Quarter Court touchinge the premisses, and stand to the censure and iudgement thereof Wherevpon the matter beinge nowe againe propounded and a Coppie of his Patent openly read many iust excep- tions were taken thereat in respect it contayned greater i?unities then the Companie may or can graunt by the King? Letters Patent?, in somuch as the Court thought fitt for their better informa?on to referr it to a select Co?ittee to be reveiwed and therevpon did nominate mr Herbert. mr Iermyn. mr Brooks. mr Wrote. mr Earle. mr Nicho: ffarrar. mr Gibbs. authorisinge them or any fower of them to meet about the same at mr ffarrars howse when mr Deputy shall appoint and to call Capt: Martin before them and to require a sight of the said Patent and whatsoeuer other writinge that may concerne the same wch they are entreated diligently to ?vse and examine and to make report of their proceeding? together wth their opinions touching the validity thereof at the next Quarter Court. [294] Mr Deputy gaue notice of nine Patent? nowe presented in Court to passe the seale of the Companie hauinge been perticulerly examined by the morning? Court wch did approue of them wch Patent? were of Two sort? the one of such as were Aduenturers by moneys paid into the Treasury for wch they had allowed 100 acres of land for euery sin- gle share of Twelue pound? Ten shillings the other beinge for Plan- ters only who had allowed fifty acres for euery person transported to Virginia: Accordinge to wch two formes the said Patent? were drawne and accordingly engrossed ready for the Seale being these that followe. To Arthur Swayne Nathaniell Basse Aduenturers and to their Asso- ciat? who vndertake to transport 100 ?sons to Virginia. To Rowland Truloue and diuers other Patentees Aduenturers &amp; to their Associat? who vndertake to transport 100 ?sons. To Iohn Crowe of Newton in the County of Washford in Ireland esquire an Aduenturer who vndertak? to transport 100 ?sons. To Edw: Rider and his Associat? an Aduenturer vndertakinge to transport 100 ?sons. To Capt Symon Leeke Planter vndertak? xc 100 ?sons. To Daniell Gookin of Corke in Ireland Planter xc 300 ?sons. To Edw: Bennett Robert Bennet Richard Bennett. Thomas Ayres Thomas Wiseman and Richard Wiseman Planters who vndertaketh for 200 ?sons. To Sr Charles North of Wakringham in the County of Nottingham for 100: To mr Leninge—100 So that the whole number vndertaken by the Aduenturers &amp; Planters to be transported to Virginia comes in all to 1200 ?sons. All wch Patent? beinge put to the question were confirmed and ordered to be sealed. Mr Deputy likewise moued signified of 4 Co?issions appointed for fower mrs of Shipps nowe bound for Virginia for transporta?on of peo- ple and good? and after for a ffishinge voyage wch Co?issions were nowe engrossinge for the seale the draft? hauinge been examined and approued of by the morning? Court vizt The first Comission was to Iohn Huddlestone mr of the Bona Noua of about 200 Tuñ. To Tho: Smith mr of the Hopewell of 60 tuñ To Dan: Gat? mr of the Darlinge of 40 tuñ To Capt: Thom Iones mr of the Discouery of 60 tuñ. All wch Co?issions the Court authorised mr Deputy to seale. [295] Mr Hawes moued that whereas the Companie had graunted a Patent for a ?ticuler Planta?on to Sr Robert Heath then Recorder of London and to his Associat? who were not expressely named that therefore the said Patent might be renued and haue their names inserted therein wch request was thought verie reasonable and well assented vnto. It was also moued and thought fitt that all such as had any shares passed ouer vnto them by order of Court or were otherwise Planters or Associat? vnto any such as were Planters or had vpon their priuate charge sent any persons to Virginia, would please within some rea- sonable time to declare themselues vnto the Court that notice might be taken of their names to be registred in a booke for that purpose to be kept whereby they might be admitted to come vnto Court?: It beinge otherwise against the order of the Companie for any to present himselfe in Court before he be admitted. Whereas the Auditors of the old Magazine were earnestly entreated to audite the Account? in mr Essingtons Hand? and to giue warrant to mr Richard Bull to pay what shall appeare to be due to euery man the Brok? for non payment? at due times beinge allowed accordinge to the orders of the Magazine ffor somuch as it was informed that mr Essington desired some better explana?on of the said order touch- ing the times when the said Brok? are to take their begiñinge It is found by pervsall of the book?, that it was ordered that the Brok? vpon default of the first payment should begin at Bartholmewe tyde, and for default of the other payment appointed to be made in Easter and Mic?as Termes, the allowance for brok? should begin at the end of those Termes, and so forward till this present daye and to ruñ at 20 ? Cent? and that the Auditors should be certified of this and desired to proceed accordingly. Whereas a mo?on was made in the former Court that for somuch as many Bills of Aduenture were passed presented to the Court from time to time wch were found to be omitted in the Printed Publica?on that therefore the book? might be hereafter kept alphabetticallwise conteyninge the names of all such Aduenturrs wch mo?on was well approued of and order giuen to the Secretary to see it donn vnto whome all such bills are to be deliuered that he may register their names whome it doth concerne. It beinge further moued in the former Court and referred to the con- sidera?on of this great Court, that whereas since the printed Publica- ?on many orders were established in Quarter Court? that did binde the Companie no lesse then the standinge lawes themselues that therefore the aforesaid Court? might be ?vsed and [296] Collec?on made into what part of all such §bindinge§ orders wch beinge further ratified might be added to the rest of the Lawes in the Printed bookes The Court approued well of this Proposition and haue therefore recomended it to the care of a select Co?ittee to see it donn vizt. Sr Edwin Sandys. mr Wrote. Sr Iohn Dãuers. mr Ro: Smith. mr Deputy. mr Nicho: ffarrar. mr Gibbs. mr Caswell. After these thing? were thus ordered mr Deputy aduertized the Com- panie that he was to acquaint them with a waightie buissines namely the proceedinge of some former Court? touchinge the Lord? of the Priuy Counsell their late proposi?on and co?aund for bringinge in all their Tobacco into England to paye the custome here due for that his Mats revenues (as it was alledged by ye ?s) could not other wise be vpheld concerninge wch that this Court might the better vnder- stand the whole proceed of this buissines from the verie begininge thereof to that pointe and period it was brought vnto, and wherevpon it nowe resteth he desired they would please to heare the same read in order as it was ?secuted wch buissines begañ the i5th of October last and so forward as may appeare by the seuerall Court?. Wch beinge read mr Deputy made two request? vnto ye Company, the first was to knowe whither they did approue of that he had donne by the aduise and direc?on of the ?said? Court? touchinge the former Propositions, the second was that they would nowe please to deliuer their opinions freely what course they conceaued best to take to release the Companie of this strict co?aund and to restore them- selues to their former liberty, and the rather for that it was expected that this ?Court? especially (wherevnto it was referred) should do somethinge herein and not omitt to declare their resolu?on touchinge this present buissines concerninge the first the Court did generally assent therevnto testifyinge their good approba?on of their ?ceeding? and of their aunsweares made vnto the lord? of the Counsell freely acknowledginge, that as the Cash stood more could not haue bin ?formed, but for the other request concerninge the Companies expresse resolu?ons touchinge the pointe in question, it was thought fitt to respite the same vntill some longer time, forsomuch as the Parliamt might happily effect somethinge that might ease the Companie of that care &amp; labor yet was it also held fitt that a choise and large Co?ittee should nowe be appointed to consult about this buissines and prepare the same against there should be further cause giuen to moue them to take some course for remedy hereof wherevpon these herevnder named were nominated and desired to meet vpon the next Satturday followinge at two of the Clocke in the afternoone at mr ffarrars howse vizt Lo: Cauendish. Lo: Padgett. Sr Edw: Sackuill. Sr ffran: Egiocke. Sr Dudly Digg?. Sr Io: Dauers. Sr Walter Earle. Sr Sam: Sandys. Sr Phil: Carey. Sr Lawr Hyde.

After this a mo?on was made that for somuch as many Excellent Proiects had bin propounded at diuers Court? in this last vaca?on when many gentlemen were out of Towne, whereby they could not take that notice of them that was fitt that therefore they might nowe againe be read and published in open Court, seinge they did not onely tend to the great benifitt of the Aduenturers that were interessed therein but also to the great honor and aduancemt of the generall Planta?on as would more plainely appeare by the Roll? themselues beinge read vnto them wherevpon order was giuen for readinge of them seuerally. The first beinge for settinge vp of a glasse furnace in Virginia for makinge of glasse and beads for the vse and benifitt of the Colony to trade wthall, to wch end certen Italians and others to the number of 16 ?sons were already sent wch worke is hoped by this to be in a good forwardnes sett vp in aduancement whereof diuers Aduenturers had vnderwritten xli a peece beinge the So?e proposed to be paid by each Aduenturor wch is to be imployed in a Iointe Stocke: So that that per- ticuler Roll was already come to the Some of 500li. A second Roll was a Magazine for prouisions of Apparrell and other necessaries whereof the Colony stood in great need and did earnestly desire to be supplied wch was nowe prouided and the Shippe Departed wch was like to returne good proffitt vnto the seuerall Aduenturers vnto wch Roll there was already vnderwritt for a Iointe Stocke 1800li. The Third Roll was for sendinge of Mayd? to Virginia to be made Wyues, wch the Planters there did verie much desire by the want of whome haue sprange the greatest hinderances of the encrease of the Planta?on, in that most of them esteeminge Virginia not as a place of Habita?on but onely of a short soiourninge haue applyed themselues and their labors wholly to the raisinge of present proffitt and vtterly neglected not only staple Co?odities but euen the verie necessities of mans life, in reguard whereof and to preuent so great an inconven- ience hereafter whereby the Planters mind? may be the faster tyed to Virginia by the bond? of Wyues and Children, care hath bin taken to prouide them younge handsome and honestly educated mayd? whereof 60 are already sent to Virginia being such as were specially recomended vnto the Companie for their good bringinge vp by their parent? or friend? [298] of good worth: Wch mayd? are to be disposed in mar- riage to the most honest and industrious Planters who are to defraye and satisfie to the Aduenturors the charges of their passages and pro- uisions at such rat? as they and the Aduenturors Agents there shall agree and in case any of them faile through mortality it is ordered that a propor?onable addi?on shalbe made vpon the rest, In the fur- therance of wch Christian Ac?on diuers of the said Aduenturors had vnderwritt diuers good so?es of money none vnder 8li whereby the whole Some of that Roll did already amount to 800li as may appeare by the subscriptions. The ffourth Roll was intended for a most certaine and benificiall trade of ffurrs to be had wth the Indians in Virginia in the lymitt?of the Southerne Colony, it beinge credibly informed both by letters from the Gouernor and Counsell of State in Virginia as also by rela?on of others of the great Trade of ffurrs wch is yearely made by the ffrench and Duch Shipps in a verie great propor?on in D' Lawarr and Hud- sons Riuer beinge not aboue 30 or 50 leagues distant from the Plan- tation and for that there is at this present so good an opertunity offered for the cheape and safe managing of the said Trade it hath moued many of the former Aduenturors to subscribe vnto this Roll, Also wherein it is so ordered that none shall subscribe aboue 100li nor any man for lesse then 20li. Whereof onely a Third part for the present voyadge is to be imployed in wch Roll there is already vnder- written the Some of 900li wch Shippe is also departed.1 1 A letter to the Colony by the Company, concerning the third and fourth Rolls, is mentioned in List of Records, No. 279, p. 151, ante. The fift Roll wch is the last though not the least in estima?on is for the sendinge of Shippwright? and howse Carpenters to Virginia where plenty of materialls is to be had, So that the onely want was of Skill- full and sufficient workemen in those kinde of professions whereof Diuers did nowe offer themselues to goe, wth whome the Colony beinge once furnished they will in short time be enhabled with Pynnaces and Boat? to make further discoueries vp into the Countrie and by meanes of howses ready framed to their hand? and afforded at reason- able rat? the Planters there and such as come newe ouer wilbe able to furnish themselues from time to time with substantiall howses well built and in a good manner to the comfort of the Inhabitants and future strength of the Planta?on. Herevpon it was signified that it was not the intent and meaninge of the former priuate Aduenturers to exclude any or to appropriate the same the same only to such as had already vnderwritten but that it was free for any member of the Companie to ioyne wth them and ?take of the honor and [299] and proffitt that would arise vnto them thereby wherevpon many gentlemen then present did offer themselues to become Aduenturers and subscribed vnto some of the said Rolls But for somuch as it was nowe growne late: It was moued that the Rolls might be presented at euery Court between this and the next Quarter Court, to the end that such as were disposed might subscribe vnto them. Notice was giuen of a certaine gentleman lately come out of Ireland that offered to transport Cattle to Virginia at easie rat?: It was there- fore moued that such as were desirous to send any Cattle thither would please to acquaint mr Deputy therewith that they might proceed to a further treaty with the said Gentlemen. Mr Deputy also signified that there were diuers verie good Shipps offred to goe to Virginia and therefore moued that such as had either good? or Passengers would giue notice of their names that prepara?on might be made accordingly.</field>

The Patent likewise for Martins Hundred was also appointed to be drawne vp against the next Quarter Court and the Companie entreated to meet in the forenoone to examine the same that it might be ready to pass the Seale with the other Patent?. [308] A letter was brought to the Court by an vnknowne ?son directed to the Honoble Companie of Virginia, content? whereof are sett downe verbatim in the Quarter Court followinge this. Wch Letter beinge read the Companie did much reioyce to heare that it had pleased God still to stirr vp so worthie a benifactor vnto the Plantation: And because the said Letter contayned some matter of waight in it, This Court thought fitt to referr it to the considera?on of the Quarter Court when the Companie were desired (accordinge to the request of the said Letter) to giue some Account howe the said first money was imployed for the better satisfac?on of the Donor. Mr Waterhowse presented in writinge the Aunsweares of such as he had solicited for moneys due vpon their subscrip?on vnto the Com- panie, by wch it appeared that diuers had Acquittances to showe for payment of those moneys they are charged with, and some others desired time to consider thereof The Court thought fitt to recomend it to the Auditors to take such course therein as they should see cause: Wherevpon Sr Io: Dãuers signified that he had moued my Lord Keeper for the Assistance of his Lps Letter vnto such as should refuse to paye in their moneys due vpon subscrip?on to the Companie And that it pleased his lp: to promise §his l?es§ should be ready if occasion were offered.

The like reward of two Shares of land was thought fitt to be bestowed on mr Balmeford in respect of his often attendance at Court? and Desire to doe the Companie seruice wch was also approued and there- vpon as the other referred to the Quarter Court for confirma?on. Notice was giuen that mr Euans produced Bill? of Aduenture for fiue shares of land whereas in the printed booke he was sett downe but fower to rectifie wch the Court gaue order to the Secretary to note this Defect in his Alphabetticall booke: And for somuch as mr Euans desired to passe two of his said Shares vnto mr Tho: Newton, the Aditors hauing allowed thereof the Court was pleased likewise to giue their approba?on.

Mr Deputy signified that mr Copland hauing had some shares of land bestowed vpon him by the last Quarter Court in reward of his good desert?, did nowe moue that he might haue his said Shares confirmed vnto him vnder the Companies Seale with allowance of fiftie acres for euery person that he and his Associat? shall transport with such other priuiledges and y?unities as shalbe thought fitt and necessarie wch mo?on was well approued of and order giuen to the Secr? to drawe an Instrument against the Quarter Court to that purpose: Where- vpon it was also moued and thought fitt that this fauor should be extended generally to all that should desire the same that their land? might be confirmed vnto them vnder the Companies Seale. Mr Deputy signified that mr Leat Minister beinge formerly appointed to preach this last Su?er in St Scyths Church vpon a Text that was giuen him §had nowe ?formed the same§ with good approba?on and beinge still desirous to goe to Virginia and to be recomended to the Gouernor for the next place that shall become voide; he praid they would please to take his request into their considera?on and that he might haue some gratuity bestowed vpon him to furnish him wth nec- essaries Wch request the Court conceaued to be verie reasonable and therevpon agreed to giue him 20li to furnish him with book? and Apparrell and to paye for his transporta?on. Mr Deputy signified that whereas order was giuen for drawing vp a Patent for the Su?er Iland?

Hospitall or el? in the Virginian Schoole or Hospitall (as it may be called and by the will? and guift? of good men may be yearely augmented) where the Companie may haue an ey ouer them and be (as it were) nursinge ffathers vnto them then I say I faithfully promise to add 450li more to make the Su?e 1000li wch if God permitt I will cheerfully send you only I desire to nominate the first Tutor or Gouernor who shall take charge to nurse and instruct them: But if you in yor Wisedomes like not of this mo?on then my humble Suite vnto ye whole body of yor Honoble Companie is that my former guift of 550li be wholly imployed &amp; bestowed vpon a free Schoole to be erected in Southampton Hundred (so it be presently imployed) or such other place as I or my freind? shall well [313] like of wherein both English and Virginians may be taught together and that the said Schoole be endowed with such priuiledges as you in yor wisdomes shall thinke fitt: The Mr of wch Schoole I humbly craue may not be allowed to goe ouer except he first bringe in to the Companie sound testimony of his sufficiency in learninge and sincerity of life The Lord giue you wise and vnderstandinge hart? that his worke herein be not negligently performed. D and A Directed To the right Honoble and wor? the Treasuror Counsell and Company for of Virginia. This letter beinge referred to the considera?on of this Court for somuch as it did require an Account of the Companie howe they haue expended the saide money vizt the 550li in gold for the bringinge vp of the Infidell? Children in true religion and christianity, Sr Edwin Sandys declared that the said money cominge vnto him enclosed in a box in the time of his beinge Treasuror, not longe after a letter sub- scribed Dust and Ashes had bin directed vnto him in §the§ quality of Treasuror, and Deliuered in the Court and there openly read he brought the money also vnto the next Court and there openly read in the Box vnopened: Wherevpon the Court after a large and serious delibera?on howe the said money might be best imployed to the vse intended, at length resolued that it was fittest to be entertayned by the Societies of Southampton Hundred and Martins Hundred and each to vndertake for a certaine number of the Infidell? Children to be brought vp by them, and amonngst them in Christian Religion and some good Trade to lyue by accordinge to the Donors religious desire; But Martins Hundred desired to be excused by reason their Planta?on was sorely weakened and as then in much confusion: Wherevpon it being pressed that Southampton Hundred should vndertake the whole they also consideringe together with the waight the difficulty also and hazard of the buissines were likewise verie vnwillinge to vndertake the managinge thereof and offered an addi?on of 100li more vnto the former some of 550li that it might not be put vpon them. But beinge earnestly pressed therevnto by the Court and findinge no other meanes howe to sett forward that great worke yealded in fine to accept thereof: Wherevpon soone after at an Assembly of that Society the Aduenturers entred into §carefull§ a considera?on howe this great and [314] and waightie buissines might with most speed and great aduantag be effected: Wherevpon it was agreed and resolued by them to imploy the said money together with an Addi?on (out of the said Societies purse) of a farr greater So?e toward the furnishinge out of Captaine Bluett and his Companie beinge 80 verie able and sufficient workmen wth all manner of prouisions for the settinge vp of an Iron worke in Virginia, whereof the proffitt? accruinge were intended and ordered in a ratable propor?on to be faithfully imployed for the educatinge of 30 of the Infidell? Children in Christian Religion and otherwise as the Donor had required: To wch end they writt verie effectuall letters vnto Sr Geo: Yeardley then Gouernor of Virginia and Capt: also of Southampton Plantation: not onely reco?endinge the excellencie of that worke, but also furnishinge him at large with aduise &amp; direc?on howe to proceed therein with a most earnest adiura- ?on (and that often itterated in all their succeedinge Letters) so to imploy his best care and industrie therein, as a worke whereon the eyes of God, Angell?, and men were fixed: The Coppie of wch letter and Direc?on through some omission of their Officer was not entred in their booke, but a course should be taken to haue it recouered. In aunsweare of this letter they receaued a letter from Sr George Yeardley; shewinge howe difficult a thinge it was at that time to obtaine any of their Children wth the consent and good likinge of their Parent? by reason of their tendernes of them &amp; feare of hard vsage by the English vnlesse it might be by a Treaty with Opachan- kano the Kinge wch Treaty was appointed to be that Su?er wherein he would not faile to do his vttermost endeauors. But Capt: Bluett dyinge shortly after his arriuall, it was a great set- tinge backe of the Iron worke intended; yet since that time, care had bin taken to restore that buissines with a fresh Supplie: So as he hoped well, the gentleman that gaue this guift should receaue good satisfac?on by ye faithfull Account wch they should be able and at all times should be ready to giue touchinge the imployment of the said money. Concerninge wch, Sr Edwin Sandys farther said that as he could not but highly co?end the gentleman for this his worthie &amp; most Chris- tian Act, So he had obserued so great inconvenience by his modestie and eschewinge of shewe of vaine glorie by concealinge his name, whereby they were depriued of the mutuall helpe and aduise wch they might haue had by conference wth him and whereby also he might haue receaued more cleare satisfac?on wth what integrity care &amp; industrie they had managed that buissines the successe whereof must be submitted to the pleasure of God as it had bin comended to his blessinge. [315] Hee concluded that if the gentleman would either vouchsafe himselfe to §or§ send any of his frend? to conferr with the said Society they would be glad to apply themselues to giue him all good satisfac?on But for his owne ?ticuler iudgement, he doubted that neither of the two courses ?ticularised in this last letter, nowe read in Court would attaine the effect so much desired: ffor to send for them into Eng- land and to haue them educated here, he feared (vpon experience of those brought by Sr Tho: Dale) might be farr from the Christian worke intended, Againe to begin wth buildinge of a ffreeschoole for them in Virginia he doubted (consideringe that none of the buildinges there there intended had as yet prospered,) by reason that as yet through their dotinge so much vpon Tobacco no such workmen could be had but at intollerable rat?, it might rather tend to the exhausting of this sacred Treasure in some smale fabricke then to accomplish such a founda?on, as might satisfie mens expecta?ons wherevpon he wished againe some meetinge between the Gentlemen or his frend? and Southampton Society that all thing? beinge debated at full and iudiciously so wayed some constant cours might be resolued on and pursued for the ?ceeding in and ?fectinge of this most pious worke for wch he praid the blessinge of God to be vpon the Author thereof; And all the Companie said Amen. In the middest of this narra?on a stranger stept in presentinge 4 books fairely bound sent from a ?son refusinge to be named who had bestowed them vpon the Colledge in Virginia being from the same man that gaue heretofore fower other great book? the names of these he nowe sent were these vizt a large Church Bible, the Co?on prayer booke, Vrsinus1 1 Zacharias Ursinus. Catichisme and a smale Bible richly imbroydered: The Court desired the Messengr to returne the gen?. that gaue them their generall acknowledgmt of much respect and thank? due vnto him. A lre also was presented from one that desired not as yet to be named wth 25li in gold to be imployed by waye of Addi?on vnto the former contribu?on toward? the buildinge of a ffree schoole in Vir- ginia to make vp the other some 125li for wch the Companie desired the messenger to returne him their hearty thank?. Mr Waterhowse hauinge two shares of land bestowed vpon him for the great paines he had taken in solicitinge such as stand indebted unto the Companie vpon their subscription whereof he had giuen a verie good Account, the said shares beinge put to the question were ratified &amp; confirmed and vnto them him. Mr Balmeford hauinge also two shares of land giuen him in considera- ?on of his often attendance at Court? and readines to doe the Com- panie seruice, being nowe put to the question were confirmed. And whereas mr Hugh Euans made request yt he might passe 2 of his shares to mr Tho: Newton beinge allowed of by the Auditors &amp; approued of by ye former Court they were put to the question &amp; con- firmed vnto him, wch Shares were due vnto him vpon paymt of his 4th and fifth Supply as by Acquittances may appeare.1 1 This paragraph was inserted by the copyist in finer writing at the bottom of the page. [316] Intelligence beinge giuen of diuers that complained they were sett downe lesse in the printed §booke§ then they had bills of Aduenture to shewe: The Court herevpon hath ordered that such Bill? should be deliuered to the Secretary (takinge a note of receipt vnder his hand) whereby the said Bill? might be in a readines to be exa?ined by the Auditors who are to amend those defect? and errors and thereby rectifie the booke against the next Publica?on and to this end mr Waterhowse is desired to giue knowledge of this order to such as ?he? shall solicite and finde to be wronged in that kinde. Herevpon Sr Edwin Sandys tooke occasion to report what paines he had taken in reveiwing the seuerall Somes sett downe in the printed booke by comparinge Sr Thomas Smiths Leger and Cash booke together, wch beinge carelesly kept by his Officers who had sett downe diuers So?es of money vnder mistaken names, he found thereby such variance and disagreement between the saide Book? as he had much adoe to reconcile them, yet he said he had nowe found out a meanes to excuse some exceptions that were formerly taken thereat, but Some others, the Auditors for Sr Tho: Smith desired some time to consider of. Mr Copland the preacher hauinge three shares of land old Aduen- ture bestowed vpon him by the last Quarter Court in reward and gratifica?on of his good Desert? did nowe humbly desire the same might be confirmed vnder the Companies Seale wth allowance of fiftie acres the ?son more for so many as he and his Associat? should Vndertake to transport at their owne propper cost? and charges Wch request was thought verie reasonable, and hauinge a Deed to this purpose ready drawne (accordinge to the order of the former Court) wch was nowe presented and read the Court approued thereof and ordered it to be sealed. [317] Mr Deputy signified that mr Leat the Minister beinge appointed to preach this last Sundy in St Scyths Church vpon a Text the Comp gaue him had ?formed the same with good approba?on and beinge still Desirous to goe to Virginia re?omended to the Gouernor and Counsell there to remayne in expectañce till some place in the ?istery become voide, did therefore praye the Companie would please to fur- nish them §him§ with some smale allowance for book? and other necessaries: wch request hauinge bin formerly taken into considera?on it was thought fitt to allowe him 20li to furnish §him§ with book? and apparrell, and to paye for his transporta?on: Wch allowance the Court did well approue of. Mr Deputy signified that one Henry mansell in his peti?on to my Lo: Keeper, amongst other his grevances he complained that the Virginia Companie stood indebted vnto him in 60li aboue these six or seauen yeares for wch cause beinge present at the Su?er Iland? Court held on Monday last in the morninge he was willed by the whole Court to attend the Præparatiue Court held for Virginia in the afternoone, where if he could make the said Debt appeare to be due vnto him they doubted not but order would be taken to giue him satisfac?on but he neither appeared then nor nowe: Wherevpon the Court thought fitt the Co?ittee appointed to certifie my Lo: Keeper touchinge this and some other his complaint? should let his lp: knowe that Mansell neuer acquainted the Auditors wth this his pretended Debt as he ought to haue donne, nor did he euer De?and it before of the Companie and yet he alledgeth in his peti?on the said Debt to be due to him aboue six yeares since in the time of Sr Tho: Smithes beinge T?er And further that beinge lately warned to two seuerall Virginia Court? to make his said Debt appeare to be due vnto him, he had notwithstandinge contemptuously as it seemeth refused to come. And for somuch as it was nowe §likewise§ reported vnto the Court that he hath giuen out, he was a free Brother of this Company (wch must either be by purchase of some shares of land or by fauor of the Court vpon his Desert?:) It was thought fitt he should bee required to make it appeare howe he came by his pretended freedome: And for this cause the Court gaue order that he should be ?emptorily warned to be present at the next Court. [318] And forsomuch as mr Caninge challenged also much money to be due to him vpon seuerall Account? he was likewise entreated by the said Su?er Iland? Court to make his Debt appeare at the Præparatiue Court held for Virginia or at the Quarter Court held this present morninge but he came not at all The Auditors did also report that mr Caninge had bin often called vpon to bringe in his Account? vnto them to be audited but he neuer came, the Court hath therefore ordered that he shalbe perremptorily warned to be present at the next Court for Virginia to exhibite his Accounts. The Aduenturers of the glasseworke desired that they might haue a Patent prepared against the next Quarter Court conteyninge a graunt of such land? as shall become due vnto them aswell for transport of ?sons as for the aduenture of their ioynt Stocke in that buissines wch request the Court assented vnto. Mr Barbor hauinge had his Account? touchinge the runinge Lotteries examined and approued by the Auditors and lying here at sundrie times in open Court to be seen whereat forsomuch as noe exception was taken he therefore praid he might accordinge to iustice and equity haue his Quietus est vnder the Legall Seale of the Companie wch request in respect mr Barbor had Deliuered vpon his corporall oath so iust and faithfull Account: and had an authenticall Certifecates to shewe from the Magistrat? and other of principall qualety of the places where he had bin imployed of the true and honest carriage of that buissines whereby he had honoured both the Companie and Ac?on it selfe The Court did willingly assent therevnto and caused his quietus est nowe presented in Court to be read and hauing approued thereof ordered the Seale to be affixed therevnto. Sr Edwin Sandys beinge respited till this Quarter Court to exhibite the remayne of his Account? did nowe declare that at his last beinge in the Country he was not able to finde out such writing? as did con- cerne his said Account? by reason all his papers had bin confusedly cast together and quite out of order, he therefore moued for some longer time for the ?fectinge of them, and in the meane while he desired no quietus est neither for this last nor his former Account? wch had bin audited and allowed of wherevpon the Court graunted him his owne time to exhibite the same. Mr Deputy likewise presented his Account to be audited whensoeuer the Auditors would please to appointe. [319] Whereas the Companie for Virginia by a former order of Court made staye of 44li vpon Capt: Weldens Tobacco out of 1200 waight he brought home this last So?er vpon his owne Account in respect he stood charged for so much due vnto the Companie for his first set- tinge out whome he was to haue serued seauen yeares according to his couenant?, contrary to wch he was nowe come home wth out any direc?on at all from the Companie and besid? had as yet yealded no Account of one penny proffitt? of Their Tenant? labors for these two last yeares for wch respect he had also sealed a bond to the Gouernor to answeare whatsoeuer the Companie could charge him withall, as also to make his returne or send a sufficient man in his place: Wch Obiec?ons the said Captaine Welden seemed to excuse with this aun- sweare: That touchinge the first he conceaued himselfe to be dis- charged by the Companies appointing of mr Thorp Deputy ouer the Colledge land?: And for the second he saith the Tenant? made him beleiue they were not to paye any thinge for the first yeare, but if the Companie did require it of them they would be accountable for it: And as for the Tobacco he nowe brought home he saith, he partly bought it with prouision of Apparrell and other Comodities he car- ried thither with him and partly gott it by his labor and good Hus- bandrie, and therefore praied the Companie would please to remitt vnto him the said 44li staid vpon his Tobacco as afore said: But the Court conceauing this tollera?on might proue an ill President vnto other their Officers sett out at their charge, and this money beinge also the Colledge Stocke that sett him out wch they haue noe power to giue awaye, but are to make good and to be acco?table they therefore thought fitt to reco?end the further considera?on hereof to the Co?- ittee appointed for the Colledge who are entreated to examine the equity of Capt: Weldens case, and takinge into considera?on his Dema?nd and to certifie their opinions what they thinke fitt to be donne therein.

A request was also made that whereas Sr Richard Bulkly late of Bewmarris in the County of Anglice deceased paid to the right Honoble Ea: of Southampton in Ianuary last i620, the Su?e of 25li for his Aduenture toward? the Planta?on in Virginia, that forsomuch as the said Sir Richard Bulkly did alwayes intend the said Aduenture to and for the behoufe of mr Thomas Bulkly his second Sonne (as was testified by good Wittnesses) that therefore the Court would please vpon surrender of the former Graunt (wch was nowe exhibited) to confirme the like vnto the said Thomas Bulkly in his owne name, who is resolued to proceed in that Planta?on wch the said Sr Richard his ffather had vndertaken as might appeare by the Patent graunted vnto him heretofore by the Compa who by a former order of Court had appointed him Elizabeth Iland to plant vpon.

William Willis peticoninge for some considera?on to be giuen him in respect that part of the charge of transportinge men for the Com- panies vse by Cap? Lawne deceased remayneth yet vnsatisfied (as he pretendeth) the Companie not knowing of any such arrearage to be behinde vnpaide thought fitt to referr the examina?on hereof to the Auditors before whome he is to make the said Debt appeare and to produce his proufes who therevpon are to certifie the Court the equity of his peti?on. Anthony Bullocke and Wm Browne in their peti?on complained that one mr Robert Barker a member of this Companie hauinge bought of Sr Amias Preston deceased the one halfe of his Aduenture beinge 50li doth doth nowe suppresse and deteyne these writings that should manifest their right to the other halfe of the said Aduenture beinge 50li more wch they purchased of the widdowe of the said Sr Amias Preston, clayminge thereby the whole Aduenture to himselfe Where- vnto mr Barker beinge present made aunsweare that [325] he had lawfully purchased the said Aduenture wch he would proue by those writing? he had to shewe, Wherevpon the Court willed him to pro– duce his euidence against the next Court to cleare the question that the Peti?oners might haue no farther cause to complaine. Mr Copland moued that whereas it was ordered by the last Quarter Court that an Vsher should be sent to Virginia with the first con- veniency to instruct the Children in the free schoole there intended to be erected, that for somuch as there was nowe a verie good Scholler whome he well knewe and had good testimony for his sufficiency and ?in? learninge and good carriage who offered himselfe to goe for the ?formance of this seruice he therefore thought good to acquaint the Court therewith and so leaue it to their better iudgement &amp; consid- era?on wherevpon the Court appointed a Co?ittee to treat with the said Party. vizt mr Gibbs. mr Copland. mr Wroth. mr Balmford. mr Wrote. mr Robert?. who are to ioyne herein with the rest of the Co?ittee and to meet about it vpon Monday next in the morninge about eight at mr Dep- uties and thereof to make report vpon. Vpon readinge the order of the former Court touchinge Captaine William Weldens vndue ?formance of the trust reposed in him by the Company in breach of the Contract made wth them, he beinge nowe present, moued, that forsomuch as he could not get the Co?ittee (vnto whome this buissines was formerly referred) to meete nor could staye any longer in Towne beinge to proceed vpon other voyadges that this Court would therefore please to take this buissines into their considera?on and finally order it, &amp; therevpon presented a writinge vnto the Court wch seemed to be framed in iustifica?on of himselfe and of what he had Donne offeringe to proue whatsoeuer he had therein sett downe. [326] Wherevpon it beinge read and his reasons per- ticulerly examined, it was found and so adiudged by the Court to be verie false and scandalous in many thing? as may appeare by the Aunsweares made vnto each seuerall obiection wch were these that followe.1 1 A letter of complaint from Weldon to Sir Edwin Sandys is referred to in List of Records, No. 166, page 139, ante. To his first obiec?on touchinge a promise of a supplie of 50 men more (the Springe y?eadiatly after his first settinge out) and that vpon the same termes as those formerly sent wth him, wch though it was not expressed in his Contract yet he said it was promised by Sr Edwin Sandys then Treasuror in his conference wth him. It was Denied and signified by Sr Edwin Sandys that he neuer made any such promise, and that what he spake was but onely a Declaration of a purpose and intent of fauor toward? him for his better encouragement in that Ac?on in case sufficient meanes came in and that he carried himselfe well whereby to deserue it of the Companie. To his second Obiec?on that he was promised 3 Shares of land to be sett out for him, wch the Gouernor denyed to do in respect he had no such order from the Companie, for somuch as they remembred no such promise they referred him for this to his Contract wch he beinge willed to shewe said he had lost it. To the Third obiection that he was to serue the Companie but for 3 yeares it was euidently proued by his Contract vnder his hand and Seale that he was to serue them for seauen yeares. To the fourth obiec?on that the Companie propor?on of victuall allowed for his men for 12 moneths was not sufficient to mayntaine them for 4 moneths and therevpon was forced to depart wth 30 of them to serue other Maisters, It was proued by the Invoices of that voyage nowe produced and read that they had allowed for each man a pound of meate a daye wch was as much as vsually they graunt to any other: And to part wth his men was imputed to his weakenes and much offended the Company when they first heard of it and caused them to [327] giue present order that they might forthwith be restored: And it was further signified that if there had bin any iust cause of want of prouision the Companie the Companie vpon the first notice could easily haue furnished them. To the fift that in stead of faire and fertill ground? ?wch? he was promised, he was seated in the most barren places of the Country: It was signified that the place appointed him was farr otherwise beinge chosen out by Sr Thomas Dale himselfe and affirmed vnto them to be the best and fruitfullest Soyle, and if he were elswhere seated then he was appointed or had betaken himselfe to a worse place and after- wards againe remoued by Captaine Mathews ?Mathews? as he pre- tended the fault was his owne and not the Companies nor had they euer notice of it till nowe. To the 6o Obiec?on that two gentlemen (whose passage he was to haue free with liberty to goe and returne at their pleasure) were deteyned in Virginia by the Gouernor 3 Monethes against their wills, &amp; could not be released but vpon vnreasonable condi?ons It was denied that euer such liberty to goe and come at pleasure was granted either to him, or those other two transported at the Companies charge who therevpon went as Servant? there to remayne: And further that it was giuen out he had taken money of one of those men for their passage thither, notwithstandinge the Companie had freely giuen it him. To the 7o that in stead of Gouernor and Comaunder he was made a Baylie and put to so meane and poore allowance as it would in short time haue starued him: It was aunsweared that mr Thorpe was onely appointed Deputy of the Colledge land?, and that it could not but appeare vnto him by their Direc?ons that the Deputies place and office was no Diminu?on either to his title or allowance no more then the Deputy of the Companies land was vnto the Captaines there, wch was nothinge at all. To the 8o: that whereas he said that diuers of this Companie protested that mr Deputy ffarrar did promise them they should enioye the prof- fitt of their first yeares labor wth out paying any thinge to the Colledge: It was Denied by mr Deputy that euer he made any such promise it beinge contrary to the Contract made with him vnder their hand?, as also contrary to the report [328] of Sr Geo: Yeardley the Gouernor and mr Thorpes Letters (wch were nowe produced and openly read in Court) who affirmed that Capt: Welden did testifie it vnto them; But to salue this Capt: Welden saith that the Gouernor hath taken order that the Tenant? should haue the fruit? of their labor for that first yeare, but vntill the Companies pleasure were knowne, and in case the Companie should Demaund it they should make it good out of their next Croppe. Lastly he said that forsomuch as all that 900 waight of Tobacco he brought home vpon his owne Account (except C waight of mr Bucks for wch he is to send him returnes) he bought with that apparrell lynnen beddinge brasse and houshold stuffe of good value he carried with him &amp; sold there at reasonable rat? as also in co?issera?on &amp; recompense of his paines and trouble in their seruice that therefore the Companie would please to remitt him the 44li staid vpon his Tobacco by a former order of Court (whereof 40 mark? was giuen him to furnish him out and the rest allowed him for the passage of him- selfe and two men) Wherevpon Captaine Welden beinge willed to withdrawe himselfe the Court tooke the premisses into their consid- era?on and obseruinge duely what the Gouernor had writt concern- inge him, signifyinge he had giuen no ?good? Account of his place and that some suspi?on there was that the Companies good? in his charge were not well accounted, for wch cause before his cominge awaye he had giuen bond of 1000li to satisfie the Companie here, And further it beinge considered also that they must be at great charg? to send another in his place and that this money was the sacred Treas- ure of the Colledge for wch the Companie are to be accountable, his Demaund herevpon beinge put to the question was by erec?on of hand? denied. Then Captaine Welden beinge called in againe and the sentence of the Court deliuered vnto him after some pause he did earnestly entreat the Court to doe him the fauor to deliuer him his bond of 1000li and to bestowe vpon him xjli for wch he stood endebted to mr Swaine the Companies ffactor at Middleburrough, acknowledg- inge further that he did submitt himselfe vnto the Companies censure And for that most of the Court were nowe risen he besought mr Deputy to moue his request to the Companie at the next Court and he should acknowledge himselfe much bound vnto him for it, he beinge resolued to go againe to Virginia wth a Plantation of his owne &amp; some freind? of his.

[330] The order of the former Court touchinge Captaine Welden beinge read mr Deputy signified that th at the risinge of the said Cort Capt: Wel- den entreated him to moue the Companie at their next meetinge that they would be pleased to deliuer vp his Bond of 1000li and to remitt him the 11li he stood indebted to mr Swayne the Companies ffactor wch he lent him at Midleburrough wch request he praid the Court to take into their considera?on and to giue him aunsweare: Wherevpon the matter being a longe time debated, it was at length put to the ques- tion, first for givinge vp of his Bond wch was by erec?on of hand? agreed vnto in respect he was nowe come home and out of the Com- panies seruice: And further it beinge also put to the question whither the 11li Debt should be remitted vnto him in mercie and fauor toward? him, it was by a generall erec?on of hand? denied, in respect the said money was part of the Colledge Stocke, and that the Companie was to be at a further charge to furnish out another in his roome. The Co?ittees report touchinge the allowance graunted vnto the Vssher of the ffree Schoole intended in Virginia beinge read mr Cop- land signified that the said Vsher havinge lately imparted his minde vnto him seemed vnwillinge to goe as Vsher or with any lesse title then mr of the said Schoole and to be also assured of that allowance that is intended to be appropriated to the mr for his propper mayn- tenance, but it was aunsweared they might ?not? swarue from the order of the Quarter Court wch did appoint the Vsher to be first estab- lished for the better aduancemt of wch Ac?on diuers had vnderwritten to a Roll for that purpose Drawne wch did already arise to a good Some of money, and was like Daylie to encrease by reason of mens affec?ons to forward so good a worke: In wch respect many sufficient Schollers did now offer themselues to goe vpon the same condi?ons as had bin proposed to this Party, yet in fauor of him for somuch as he was spea- cially recomended by mr Copland whome the Companie do much respect the Court is pleased to giue him some time to consider of it between this and the next Court desiringe then to know his direct aunsweare whither he will accept of the place of Vsher as had bin offered vnto him And if he shall [331] accept thereof then the Court haue entreated mr Balmeford. mr Copeland. mr Caswell. mr Mellinge. to conferr with him about the methode of teachinge and the book? he intends to instruct Children by.

Mr Nicho: ffarrar moued that for somuch as his Account? for the ffurr buissines were nowe made vp that the Aduenturers of that priuate Companie would please to appoint some to examine and audite the said Account?: Wherevpon the Court nominated mr Bull ?mr Moorer?. mr Caswell ?mr Palmer?. mr Barbor. to meete vpon Satturday the second of March next in the morninge.

Mr Hiddlebrand Preiwsen assigned ouer one share of land to Thomas Pemble, wch being allowed by the Auditors passed the approba?on of this Court. Mr Edward ffaucet in like manner passed three shares of land to mr Nicholas ffarrar. Mr Scott with like approba?on and allowance of the Court passed 3 shares to mr Patrick Copland. Whereas it was moued that Henry Mansell hath by his Petition to my Lo: Keeper declared that this Compa were indebted vnto him in 60li aboue these 6 yeares in Sr Thomas Smiths time and yet it did noe waye appeare, and that mr Caninge pretended that this Compa were likewise indebted vnto him but for somuch as the said mr Caninge had receaued diuers Somes of money out of the Virginia Cash, others by Subscription and Lottery bookes; It was therefore ordered that against the next Court the said mr Caninge and Mansell should be warned to bringe in their Account?, and that Mansell should declare vnto that Court whither he be free or not, because mr Woodall had verified somuch vpon oath, as was then alledged. Vpon the humble request of Wm Capps the Court ordered a Certificate to be drawne vp by the Secr? to testifie the good esteeme it had of him aswell in the Colony in Virginia as of the Companie here, as may appeare by the rewards of his good seruice vnto them, As also ?of? what ability ?he? is reported to be there in respect of ye great Supplies he hath sent thither wch Certificate the Secretary is appointed to witt- nesse in the name of the Companie. [333] Whereas the last Quarter Court thought fitt to enlarge the former Co?ittee with an addi?on of some other gentlemen to examine the Certificate of Captaine Martin presented at the said Court by one Captaine Hazell and therevnto to frame some aunsweare for the better informa?on of those Lord? (whose hand? he had procured vnto the said Certificate) It was nowe moued that for somuch as the said Co?ittee had not yet mett about it by reason of much other buissines as also for that Capt Martin had excepted against and not spared to traduce some of the said Co?ittee, notwithstandinge they proceeded with as much respect and fauor toward? him as in reason could be required that therefore it would please the Court to take this buissines againe into their ?owne? hand? and Debate the same in the presence of this generall Assembly. Wherevpon the Court caused the said Certificate to be read wch was in the name of the Counsell and Company for Virginia here resident being as well in iustifica?on of Captaine Martins good Desert? as also in approba?on of his Patent nowe questioned by the Companie wch Certificate beinge read they caused also his Patent to be deliberately read and examined and wth all those exceptions wch the former Co?ittee had collected vpon it, By all wch as also by the Court book? beinge searched it plainely appeared that the Patent was neuer confirmed by a Quarter Court but only had the approba?on of a priuate Court pur- posely called for that buissines only; It was therefore adiudged by the whole Court to be absolutely voide in lawe and of no validity Wherevpon after longe delibera?on it was aduised that for sauinge the reputa?on of the Companie whome Capt: Martin had apparently wronged, in vsinge of their names in the said Certificate as if they went about now to Disavowe their owne Act or that some of the Com- pany in a kinde of fac?on or spleene toward? him did seme to crosse the Act of the whole Companie and of his Mats Counsell for Virginia in whose name the said Certificate was framed to the infinite wronge of the whole body. ffor auoydinge of wch fowle asper?on and the ill construc?ons that might be made thereof, Herevpon it was agreed and ordered that a convenient Declara?on should be drawne vp consisting of these fower head?. [334] 1.That whereas they are constrained and lymited by his Mats Letters Patents to fower great and generall Quarter Court? for passinge of all Patent? of waight and Disposinge of land in Virginia That contrary herevnto Captaine Martin presented both this ?this? his Patents for land and his other Patent for the Masterpp: of the ordinance ready engrossed and wth out the preexamina?on of a Co?ittee to the appro- ba?on of an inferior Court wch had no power to graunt any Patents where notwithstandinge it passed by the power of Captaine Martins frend? to the Dislike of some then present and could neuer since that time obtaine the confirma?on of a Quarter Court. 2.To Declare such exceptions against his said Patent as did espeacially repugne aswell the Gouerment of the Colony in Virginia and the authority of his Mats Letters Patents as also the standinge orders of the Companie fundamentally deriued and grounded vpon the said Letters Patents. 3.To Declare the ill effect? wch haue followed those his exhorbitant priuiledges namely that herevpon Capt: Martin hath refused to submitt himselfe to the lawes and orders of the Colony in Virginia and hath made his Planta?on a receptacle of disordered persons where such as are indebted do shroud and rescue them selues vnder his protec?on wch was also viua voce testified in open Court whereof the Gouernr and Counsell of State there haue often and verie much complained. Lastly that the Companie haue and do still offer to graunt him a newe Patent vpon surrender of his old, wth as large and ample priui- ledges as they may or can graunt by his Mats Letters Patent?. [335] Accordinge to these heads and what other addi?ons shalbe thought necessarie the Court haue entreated Sr Io Dãuers. mr Wrote. mr Deputy. mr Gibbs. mr Iermyn. mr Nich: ffarrar. or any three of them to drawe vp a Declara?on and to meete about it to morrowe in the afternoone at mr Deputies about two of the Clocke, if mr Iermyn can then be present, but if not then to meet vpon fri- day morninge at mr Iermyns Chamber in the Temple. And it is further agreed and ordered that vpon the finishinge of the said Declaration a Court be warned to pervse and examine the same (and that Captaine Martin be then peremptorily warned to ?be? pres- ent,) and after they haue approued thereof they thinke fitt that diuers Coppies be made of the said Declaration to present vnto the Lord? and others.</field>
