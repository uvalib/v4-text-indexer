For admission to the Freshman Class in the Department of Engineering the candidate must be at least sixteen years old. He must present a certificate of honorable withdrawal from the school last attended, or other valid proof of general good character. He must further satisfy the Dean of the University as to his adequate preparation for the work by passing the Entrance Examinations specified below or by the presentation of equivalent certificates of preparation signed by the President of a recognized institution of collegiate rank, or by the Principal of an accredited high school. The topics required for entrance and their values in units are as follows: English A.âGrammar and Grammatical Analysis 1 English B.âComposition and Rhetoric 1 English C.âCritical Study of Specimens of Literature 1 Mathematics A.âAlgebra to Quadratics 1 Mathematics B.âQuadratics, Progressions, Binomial Formula Â½ Mathematics C.âPlane Geometry 1 Mathematics D1.âSolid Geometry Â½ Mathematics D2.âPlane Trigonometry Â½ History.âAncient; MediÃ¦val; English; American (any one) 1 Electives 6Â½ Total 14 High school students who expect to study engineering are advised to include among their electives Physical Geography, Chemistry, Physics, Mechanical Drawing, and Shop-work (valued at one unit each). Other electives which may be offered are History of English and American Literature (1 unit), History (3 units), Latin (4 units), Greek (2 units), German (2 units), French (2 units), Spanish (2 units), Botany (half unit), ZoÃ¶logy (half unit). A candidate may be admitted as a Conditioned Student in spite of some deficiencies, provided these are not such as will impair the integrity of his work. But no such candidate will be conditioned except upon subjects actually taught in this university, nor will any candidate be conditioned on more than two units; and all conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the next session after initial registration. Courses taken for the removal of entrance conditions may in no case be counted as part of the work credited for any degree. No conditions will be allowed in English A, or B, or in Mathematics A, B, or C. A candidate may be admitted as a Special Student, without formal examination, provided he is more than twenty years old, and gives evidence of serious purpose and of fitness to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for any degree. From and after June, 1915, the special students will be listed separately in the catalogue. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. The candidate who has satisfied the requirements for entrance as above defined is matriculated as a student of Engineering and admitted to the Freshman Class. The studies of this class comprise lecture-courses in Mathematics, Chemistry and Engineering, with associated laboratory courses in Chemistry, Drawing, Shop-work and Field-work. For advancement to the Sophomore Class the student must have completed at least two-thirds of his Freshman work. Upon entering this class he elects his specialty. The courses thereafter diverge according as the student is an applicant for a degree in Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Chemical, or Mining Engineering. Programmes of study for each degree are given below. The courses are so ordered that the specified entrance requirements are adequate for the work of the Freshman Year. Each succeeding year presupposes the completion of the work for all the foregoing years. Students are advised to adhere strictly to the regular programmes. The arrangements specified in them have been carefully planned and are the best. Departures from the curriculum will in almost every case produce conflicts in lecture hours or laboratory periods and may cost the student a year's time. Haphazard election is discouraged and in extreme cases will be prohibited. No student will be registered for a course unless in the opinion both of the Dean and of the professor his preliminary training has fitted him for the profitable pursuit of that course. Students are especially advised against the attempt to crowd too many studies into their scheme of work, and are warned that admission to advanced courses will be granted only to those who have adequate mathematical and scientific training to profit by them. Men overloaded with work, too great in volume or in difficulty for their powers, suffer inevitable discouragement and incur almost certain failure. Changes of classes with transfer of fees may be made, subject to the approval of the Dean, within two weeks after the beginning of any term. Thereafter such changes may be made only on recommendation of the Faculty, and then without transfer of fees. Every candidate for a degree in Engineering will be required at the beginning of his graduating year to submit to the Dean some subject for independent study suited to the student's especial course and aims. After such subject has been approved by the Dean and the professor in charge, the student will be expected to carry out for himself the necessary literary and laboratory researches and to present his results in the form of a Graduating Thesis. Such thesis must be typewritten on standard sheets, 8 by 10Â½ inches, bound in a durable stiff cover, and handed in for final approval not later than May 25th. All necessary computations and drawings must accompany the thesis. Serious weight will be given to this work in estimating the student's fitness for graduation. In the following matter describing subjects of instruction, in the various programmes of courses, and in lecture, laboratory and examination schedules, these subjects of instruction are grouped into nine classes, each subject being designated by a distinctive number for each term, the lecture and laboratory courses being likewise differentiated. The grouping by classes follows the arrangement shown herewith: Mathematics 100 to 199 Physics 200 to 299 Chemistry 300 to 399 Geology and Mining 400 to 499 Mechanics 500 to 599 Drawing and Shop-work 600 to 699 Civil Engineering 700 to 799 Mechanical Engineering 800 to 899 Electrical Engineering 900 to 999 Lecture-courses are listed in the first fifty numbers of all classes; laboratory or practice courses are listed in the second fifty numbers of all classes. MATHEMATICS. Freshman Mathematics. [Page.] 9-10, M. W. F. 100. Trigonometry. A complete course in Plane and Spherical Trigonometry is pursued with constant drill in the solution of problems, and exercises in the use of logarithms. (Fall.) 101. College Algebra. The work begins with the Progressions and proceeds with the study of the Binomial Formula, of the Convergence and Divergence of Series, and of the Binomial. Exponential and Logarithmic Series. The study of Inequalities and Determinants prepares for the Theory of Equations with which the course is closed. (Winter.) 102. Analytical Geometry. In this elementary course the study of Cartesian and Polar CoÃ¶rdinates is followed by numerous exercises on the graphical representation of equations. Special attention is given to the straight line and the representation of the general equation of the first degree in two variables. The course is intended to prepare for the fuller study of the Analytical Geometry of the Conic Sections. (Spring.) Sophomore Mathematics. [Echols.] 12-1, M. W. F. 103. Conic Sections. This course in Analytical Geometry takes the subject up at the point left off in Course 102 and completes the study of the conic in its particular and general forms; a brief examination of curves referred to polar coÃ¶rdinates is then followed by the special study of a number of classical curves. The Differential Calculus is begun and the remainder of the term spent on exercises in differentiation of functions. (Fall.) 104. Differential Calculus. The Differential Calculus is continued and applied to simple exercises in the Expansion of Functions, Evaluation of Indeterminate Forms and problems of Maximum and Minimum for functions of one variable. The method is then applied to the Geometry of Curves, Tangencies, Curvature, Envelopes and Curve Tracing. (Winter.) 105. Integral Calculus. The Integral Calculus is taken up; the integral is defined, and exercises in elementary integration prepare for the application to numerous problems in Lengths, Areas and Volumes. When time permits a brief introduction to ordinary differential equations will be given. (Spring.) PHYSICS. 200-201-202. General Physics. [Hoxton.] 11-12, T. Th. S.

[Edgar.] 9-10, M. W. F. This course is intended to serve as an introduction to the general subject of Organic Chemistry, including chemical synthesis and the theories of molecular structure, as applied to the compounds of Carbon. This course is optional, but it is recommended for those who may have sufficient advanced standing to enable them to give the time to it. General Chemistry prerequisite. (Fall, Winter, Spring.) 312-313-314. Advanced Organic Chemistry. [Edgar.] 3 hours a week. The work of the first term consists of lectures and recitations on the History of Chemical Development and Theory. The second and third terms consist of lectures, etc., on Advanced Organic Chemistry, making use of the most recent and comprehensive treatises on this subject. This course is optional and may be substituted for 306-7-8 if the student is adequately prepared in organic chemistry. General and Organic Chemistry prerequisite. (Fall, Winter, Spring.) 330-331-332. Analytical Chemistry. [Dunnington.] 10-11, T. Th. S. The course consists of three lectures a week, throughout the session, followed by practical experiments in the laboratory. Weekly written exercises are required. The work is divided among the three terms as follows: First Term; A course in Chemical manipulation, Blowpipe Analysis, Recognition of ores, Fire Assaying of ores of Lead, Gold and Silver. Second Term; A systematic course in Inorganic Qualitative Analysis. Third Term; Practice in the analysis of salts, alloys and ores, and the examination of potable water, coal, limestone, clay and so on, including some simpler quantitative determinations. (Fall, Winter, Spring.) 333-334-335. Advanced Analytical Chemistry. [Dunnington.] 10-11, M. W. F. The work of this course is also given in three lessons a week throughout the session. This course is primarily one in Quantitative Analysis. After some training in manipulation and gravimetric estimations, the class pursues volumetric estimations and a full course in Quantitative Analysis of minerals, ores, coal, soil, iron and steel, technical products, and so on. Weekly written exercises are required. As the student advances in the course he is encouraged to undertake original research and assist in its prosecution; and in determining his fitness for graduation, work of this kind is considered as having much weight. (Fall, Winter, Spring.) 336-337-338. Industrial Chemistry. [Dunnington.] 3-4, M. W. F. This course is concerned with the applications of chemistry to the purposes of human life. The Fall Term is devoted to the metallurgy and uses of iron, steel, copper and all the other important metals, with the manufacture of pottery, brick, lime, cement and explosives. The Winter Term deals with the manufacture of acids, alkalies, salts, fertilizers and glass, and the preparation of foods and waters. The Spring Term considers the preparation of starch products and flavorings, and the chemistry of dyeing, tanning, rubber, paints, lubricants, disinfectants, lighting, heating, and refrigeration. Weekly exercises in chemical computations are regularly required, and a weekly oral examination is held at 12-1 on Tuesday. The collections of the University in illustration of the processes and products of Industrial Chemistry have been procured at much expense and pains in this country, England, France and Germany, and are extensive and good; among the best on this side of the Atlantic.

The Faculty declines to accept any responsibility for conflicts, unless the same have been authorized in advance by a special vote of the Faculty. For the session 1915-16 the initial examination days are 13 Dec., 19 Mar., 29 May. EXAMINATIONS AND REPORTS. Oral examinations are held at the beginning of each lecture hour on the topics of the preceding lecture. Written test papers are set monthly, or at such other interval as the professor may appoint. Absences from lecture except by reason of sickness are not excused without a written leave from the Dean. Class standing is determined on the basis of the oral examinations and the written tests. Absence from the latter or failure to answer incurs a zero grade. Absences from laboratory periods, however caused, must be made up by special private arrangement with the instructor. Written examinations are held at the end of each term on the entire work of that term. The result of the examination combined with the student's class-standing gives his term-grade. The pass-mark is seventy-five per cent. Absence from the written term examination incurs a zero term-grade, which may not be removed except by the passage of a special written examination on the work of that term. Such special examinations are granted only upon presentation of a written certificate from a reputable physician that the student by reason of sickness on the day of the regular examination was unable to attend. Regular Reports are sent out at the end of every term to the student's parent or guardian. These state for each course followed the term-grade and the number of absences. Further comment may be added by the Dean or the professor, if it appears probable that such comment would be helpful to the student. Parents are urged to examine these reports carefully, and to exert such parental influence as may seem needed to establish and confirm the student in habits of industry and order. Special Reports are sent to parents at the end of each month for students delinquent in attendance or studiousness and for delinquents only. When a student is making steady progress and showing due diligence in his work only the regular reports are sent. The receipt of a special report is evidence that, in the judgment of the Faculty, prompt and pointed parental admonition is urgently needed. Re-examinations are held during registration week in September. To these re-examinations the Faculty will admit, on the recommendation of his professor, any student of the previous session who in any course fell below the pass-mark of seventy-five per cent., but made at least sixty-five per cent. at the regular examination. For every such re-examination the student must pay to the Bursar on or before July 15th a fee of $5, which fee is in no case returnable. The student who fails in any course and does not make up his deficiency on re-examination will be required to register anew for that course and attend the lectures and pass the regular examination, unless relieved by special vote of the Faculty. The Dean will send to every student eligible for re-examination a programme of the dates of the September examinations. If in any class in the Department of Engineering a student fails to make satisfactory progress, he is first admonished by the professor in charge. In default of prompt and permanent improvement he is next formally warned by the Dean. If due amendment is then not immediately effected, the student's name is dropped from the rolls of the Department, on the ground that he is not accomplishing the purposes for which he should have entered upon a University course of study. REGULATIONS. The following regulations, adopted to define the policy of the Faculty, are published for the information and guidance of the Students: 1. Practice-courses as well as lecture-courses must be conducted under the Honor System. The student who submits any work to be graded is considered to submit it under pledge. 2. When the lecture-course and the associated practice-course are given in the same term of the same year, no student will be admitted to examination on the lecture-course until he has completed at least three-fourths of the practice-course. 3. No student will be admitted to any practice-course unless he is at the same time pursuing the associated lecture-course, or has already received credit for the same. 4. No student will be admitted to the graduating examination on a lecture-course unless he has been present at more than half the lectures in that course. 5. In the technical courses in Engineering (i. e., courses not given in the College) term-grades shall not be averaged; except that the term-grades for Freshman Drawing (600-601-700) may be averaged for first-year men only, provided no mark is below 65. 6. The pass-mark in every course is 75. If a student's term-grade in any course is less than 75, but more than 65, he may be admitted by the Faculty to re-examination at the beginning of the next session, provided he has completed all the associated practical work of the course. 7. No student who fails to make 75 on re-examination shall be granted another examination on the course until he has again attended lectures on that course. 8. Special examinations are not given except by reason of sickness on the day of examination, attested by the written certificate of a reputable physician, or for other like providential cause. In every case they must be validated by special vote of the Faculty. 9. A student whose term-grades average less than 40 for all the courses in which he is registered shall be at once dropped from the rolls. If his average is above 40 with no mark above 65, he is placed on probation. 10. A student on probation, who in the next term makes less than 65 on each and all his courses, shall be at once dropped from the rolls. PROGRAMMES OF STUDY FOR DEGREES IN ENGINEERING.

graduating thesis, the Faculty will award to any student in regular and honorable standing the appropriate Degree of Civil Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Chemical Engineer, or Mining Engineer. In each programme will be found the Topics of Study for the several years. The hours for lectures and laboratory exercises and the dates for the examinations are given in the Schedule. The student who adheres strictly to any one of the above programmes will escape all conflicts of lecture hours, laboratory periods, and examination days. EXPENSES OF REGULAR STUDENTS. The average annual expenses of a student who pursues the regular course in Engineering will be: Outside Students Virginians University Fee $ 40 $ 20 Tuition and Laboratory Fees (average) 105 65 Living Expenses (for nine months) 250 250 Books and Drawing Materials 20 20 Incidental Expenses (for nine months) 45 45 Total for average conditions $460 $400 The charges for Tuition are uniform to all students, except that Virginians are relieved of tuition on courses offered in the College. The fee for each collegiate class taken will be $25, with the addition of the prescribed laboratory charges, which are $5 per class for Physics and $15 for Chemistry. For each class in Analytical Chemistry a special fee of $50 is charged for tuition, plus $10 for apparatus and supplies. The fee for each technical lecture-course is $30, for each practice-course in drawing $15, for each laboratory or practice course in Applied Mechanics, Engineering, Shop-work, or Field-work $5. These fees include all charge for laboratory materials; but the student is held further responsible for breakage. The Living Expenses include board, lodging, fuel and lights, servant and laundry; the average is $28 a month, the minimum $20, and a reasonable maximum $35. Books and Drawing Materials will cost about $80 for the four-year course. Incidental Expenses ought to be kept within modest bounds; the above estimate is sufficient; large allowances of pocket money promote idleness and attract companions of the baser sort. No allowances are made for clothing or travel, the expenses for which vary too much to be introduced into any general estimate. The following are payable on entrance: University Fee ($40); Tuition and Laboratory Fees ($105); Contingent Deposit ($10); Books and Instruments ($20); and one month's Living Expenses ($35-20). The student will need at entrance about $200. SPECIAL COURSE IN HIGHWAY ENGINEERING. In recognition of the growing interest in Good Roads in Virginia and the immense social and economic importance of the construction of such roads in all parts of the commonwealth, the Faculty of the Department of Engineering has rearranged the course of instruction in this topic and brought them together into the Winter Term, so as to form a Special Course in Highway Engineering. To render this work accessible to as many young Virginians as possible, the University offers a limited number of free scholarships to adequately prepared students, citizens of Virginia, who shall be nominated by the Boards of Supervisors of their respective counties. Such students pay only a $5 fee for the use of field instruments and laboratory equipment. To others the fee for this special course is $50. The following summary gives the context of the course: Lecture-Courses. 703. Roads and Streets. [Newcomb.] 9, Th. F. S. 700. Plane Surveying. [Newcomb.] 11, T. Th. S. 605. Structural Design.

Drafting rooms: desks and instruments (page 30). Full details are given in the sections of this catalogue indicated by page and number as above. Applications for scholarships, accompanied by the required credentials, should be addressed to the Dean of the Department of Engineering. ADVANCED STANDING. Under the elective system of the University of Virginia a student who has completed courses of college or university grade in other institutions of learning on mathematical or scientific subjects may be excused from attendance upon these courses by the Dean, with the advice and consent of the professor in charge, and will then be registered for the more advanced work. In order to secure College Credit upon such courses toward a degree in Engineering from this University the applicant must showâ 1. That the courses offered are coextensive with the corresponding courses as given in the University of Virginia. 2. That his examination grades on them were not less than the seventy-five per cent. pass-mark of this University. Such credits may be granted by the Faculty upon the recommendation of the Dean and the professors in charge; but are automatically revoked by the failure of the student to pass in the more advanced courses in the related topics. The same rules apply to Credits on Summer School Courses; except that for courses in the Summer School of this University the examination questions must be prepared by the professor in charge of the regular course and the answers must be read and graded by him. Credits on Practice-Courses in Drawing, Shop-work, or Field-work may be granted to applicants who have gained in professional practice the training which these courses represent. Such applicants must file with the Dean proper certificates from the official under whom the work was done and must in addition pass a practical test on the subjects for which credit is desired. DRAFTING ROOMS AND SHOPS. The drafting rooms are abundantly lighted and are provided with solidly constructed tables with locked drawers for instruments and materials. Each student is assigned to a table and has a drawer for his exclusive use. The regular Drawing Classes execute each one plate a week under the supervision of the Instructors in Drawing. The more advanced students have such additional drawings assigned by their respective professors as are needed for the full development of the courses of study. Careful attention is given to the training of the students in free-hand lettering, in the conventional signs of mechanical drawing, in the proper lay-out of drawings, and in neat and accurate execution. Exercises are required also in tracing and in blue-printing, the rooms for which are conveniently arranged and in close contiguity to the drafting rooms. While, however, technical dexterity is demanded, the graphical method is taught and used primarily as an indispensable instrument of research, the thoughtful mastery of which is essential for the instructed Engineer. The construction and theory of the Polar Planimeter, the Slide Rule, and the Pantograph are carefully taught, and the student is trained in the practical use of these appliances for the rapid and accurate production of estimates and copies from finished drawings. The Shop Equipment is throughout of the best quality, the machines being all from good makers and of sizes ample for the purposes of instruction. A full outfit of hand tools is maintained at all times. Each shop is equipped for the instruction of a squad of sixteen students, this being as large a number as one instructor can properly direct at once. The Machine Shop is provided with four first-class engine lathes, illustrating the practice of the best American makers; with a planer, a shaper, two drill presses, a universal milling machine (Brown and Sharpe), and a universal grinder (same makers); also with a gas forge for tempering tools, a cut-off saw for metal rods, an emery wheel, grindstone, and so on. The Wood Shop is furnished with five small lathes, a large pattern maker's lathe, a jointer, a planer, a saw bench for slitting and cross-cutting, a band-saw, a jig-saw, and a wood trimmer for pattern making, six cabinet maker's benches, and an ample supply of the familiar hand tools. The Foundry has a cupola furnace for working cast iron, a brass furnace, a core oven, and all needful accessories for moulding and casting; the blast for the cupola is furnished by a special blower, driven by a small high-speed steam engine. The Forge Room is equipped with Buffalo down-draft forges; and the necessary smith's tools; the draft is furnished by an engine-driven blower, and the exhaust is operated by a fan driven also by the engine. LABORATORY WORK IN APPLIED MECHANICS. The Sinclair Laboratory for work in Strength of Materials was founded on the original donation of Mrs. John Sinclair, of New York City, as a memorial to her late husband. The collection has since been considerably enlarged. It contains Riehle and Olsen machines, each of 100,000 pounds capacity, arranged for tensile, compressive, and transverse tests; an Olsen torsion machine of 50,000 inch-pounds capacity; an Olsen compression machine of 40,000 pounds capacity; a Ewing tester for the elasticity of rods; hand machines for testing rods and wires under pull and small specimens of timber and cast iron under transverse loads; Fair-banks and Olsen cement testers of 1,000 pounds capacity each; appliances for torsional tests on both long wires and short wires; together with the necessary accessory measuring instruments for utilizing these machines. The laboratory equipment for work in Hydraulics comprises a steel tank for weir experiments with adjustable bronze notches; a hook gauge for accurate measurement of surface levels; a cast-iron stand pipe with adjustable bronze orifices for experiments on efflux; a series of pipes with bends, elbows, and tees for measuring pipe friction; and the proper manometers and gauges for reading pressures. For the field-work the outfit of field instruments has been enlarged by a current meter of modern construction and a set of hollow copper ball floats for direct stream velocity measurements. FIELD AND LABORATORY WORK IN CIVIL ENGINEERING. The outfit of Field Instruments contains compasses, transits, and levels of various approved makes; a solar transit, furnished also with stadia wires and gradienter for tachymetric work; hand-levels and clinometers for field topography; plane tables; a sextant; together with an adequate supply of leveling rods, telemeter rods, signal poles, chains, tapes, pins, and so on. For hydraulic surveys a hook gauge and a current meter are provided. All students are instructed in the theory and adjustments of the field instruments and in their practical use in the field. They are also required to make up their field-books in standard forms; to reduce their surveys and execute all the necessary profiles, plans, and maps; and to determine lengths, areas, and volumes both from the maps and from the original notes. Polar planimeters are provided for facilitating such estimates and a pantograph for making reduced copies of finished drawings. The apparatus for tests of Non-bituminous Road Materials includes a two-cylinder Deval abrasion machine, a ball mill, a moulding press for briquettes of rock dust, a Page impact cementation tester, a Page impact toughness tester, a rock crusher and a Purdue brick rattler. This outfit the University owes to the generous aid of Dr. Logan Waller Page. In addition, the Department has acquired a 40,000-pound compression tester, a diamond core drill, a diamond rock saw, a grinding lap, a Westphal balance, specific gravity apparatus, and a complete set of sieves. Useful researches in the road-building rocks and gravels of Virginia, as well as the standard tests, are conducted each year by the class in Civil Engineering. Provision has been recently made of apparatus for tests of Bituminous Road Materials. This includes the New York Testing Laboratory penetrometer, the Hirschbaum ductility machine, the Engler viscosimeter, the asphalt viscosimeter, the New York Testing Laboratory extractor, the New York State Board of Health oil tester, Hubbard pyknometers, asphalt flow plates, gas and electric hot plates, and all the accessory apparatus needed for research on bituminous road-binders LABORATORY WORK IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING. The Steam Engine Tests are made on the high-speed Ball engine, which operates the shops. This motor has been specially equipped for the purpose. It receives steam from the main line through a Sweet separator; humidity determinations are thus made twiceâonce by a separating calorimeter before the steam enters the separator, and again by a throttling calorimeter as it enters the cylinder. It is fitted with proper indicators, and permanent indicator rigging so that at any time cards may be taken and the indicated horse-power determined. In like manner a friction brake is so arranged that it may be at once applied for the determination of brake horse-power. Connections are so made with a Wheeler surface condenser that the engine may at will be operated either condensing or non-condensing. Provisions are made for measuring the temperatures and the amounts of the condensing water and the condensed steam produced during the run. With these data a complete heat balance of the experimental run is attainable. The Steam Turbine Tests are made on a DeLaval 30 horsepower turbine direct-connected to a 25 kva. alternating current generator. The turbine takes steam from the main line through a Cochrane separator; humidity tests are made with a throttling calorimeter below the separator. Pressure gauges indicate the steam pressure before and after passing the governor and after expansion in the nozzles. Humidity tests of exhaust steam are made with a separating calorimeter. The turbine has interchangeable nozzles for saturated steam exhausting to atmosphere; for saturated steam exhausting to condenser; for superheated steam exhausting to condenser. Steam consumption is determined by weighing the condensate. Power output is measured at the generator, the efficiency of the latter being known. The Steam Pump Tests are made on a Worthington direct acting duplex pump, receiving steam from the main line and exhausting either to atmosphere or condenser. By weighing the condensed steam the hourly consumption is determined. The pump draws water from a concrete tank in the floor of the laboratory and delivers it to a copper-lined tank in the attic under a head of forty-five feet. Water from the attic tank is returned to a wrought-iron weir tank in the laboratory, and thence to the concrete tank. In the weir tank quantity of water delivered is measured. Velocity head is determined indirectly from the quantity and the known area of the discharge nozzle. Friction head is determined independently, and steam consumption per developed horse-power is computed. The Air Compressor Tests are made on a Remington Ammonia compressor, 4â³ Ã 6â³ double cylinder, single acting, so arranged that it may be connected either to the refrigerating machine or an air storage tank of ample capacity. Temperature of the storage tank is determined at a thermometer cup passing well across the diameter of the tank near its central portion. From the temperature, pressure, and the known capacity of the tank compressor-capacity is determined; a check on the capacity from the indicator diagrams being thus obtained. Power imput is measured by a calibrated electric motor which drives the compressor. The Air Engine Tests are made on a 3â³ Ã 4â³ single cylinder double acting engine receiving air from the storage tank at any desired pressure below 100 pounds. The engine is permanently rigged for taking indicator diagrams, the intake air temperature being determined near the cylinder. A friction brake and a revolution counter provide means for determining power output. This equipment provides for the determination of (a) Mechanical efficiency of the compressor, (b) Cylinder efficiency of the compressor, (c) Efficiency of transmission, (d) Cylinder efficiency of the engine, (e) Mechanical efficiency of the engine, (f) Over-all efficiency of the air plant. For Steam Boiler Tests the boilers of the university heating and lighting plant are available. The department is equipped with the necessary apparatusâthermometers, gauges, steam calorimeters, fuel calorimeters, gas analyzers, scales, tanks, and so on. Students of Mechanical Engineering are taught by practical lessons in the boiler-room the standard methods for boiler trials, and the class makes each session at least one complete trial. The Gas Engine Tests are made on an Otto machine of 15 I. H. P. and 12 B. H. P. This is also provided with its friction brake, indicator rigging, and indicator. The cooling water is run in from calibrated tanks and provision is made for observing not only its amount but the initial and final temperatures. Gasoline or alcohol is used as fuel, and is run in from a graduated wrought-iron bottle, so that the amount consumed is determined. The heating power is obtained by an independent test with a Rosenhain calorimeter. Samples of the burnt gases are drawn from the exhaust pipe and analyzed in an Orsat gas apparatus. With these data, and the observed numbers of revolutions and explosions, the heat balance is worked out. The Refrigerating Tests are made on a Remington Ice Machine of one ton capacity. This is an ammonia compression machine driven by an electric motor. Instead of brine, plain water is used, heated by a steam jet to 100 degrees and then cooled down to 40 degrees by the machine. A run is first made with the pipes empty in order to determine the friction horse-power. The ammonia is then turned on and the run is made under load. In both cases the power consumed is measured both by wattmeter and by ammeter and voltmeter readings. The tanks are accurately calibrated and careful measurements of the temperature are made through the run. Indicator cards are also taken from the ammonia cylinders and the number of revolutions is registered by counter. With these data the mechanical and thermodynamic performance of the machine are figured out. For Engine Balancing Experiments the 3â³ Ã 4â³ air engine is provided with detachable weights which may be clamped at any desired position relative to the crank and the axis of the main shaft. The engine is then suspended by coil springs; the exactness of the balance from previously computed weights being determined by the nature of vibration of the suspended frame. LABORATORY WORK IN ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING. The Scott Laboratory of Electrical Engineering.âThis laboratory was initially equipped and endowed by Mrs. Frances Branch Scott, of Richmond, Va., as a memorial to her late son, an alumnus of this university. During the year 1910 the equipment was substantially increased through the generosity of the Hon. Charles R. Crane, of Chicago, Ill., a friend of the university. During 1912, still further substantial additions were made, consisting of measuring instruments, auxiliary control apparatus, and more particularly a steam-turbine driven alternating current, three-phase, generator with exciter and control switchboard. In addition to full sets of electric meters with the appliances for testing and calibrating them, galvanometers of the best modern types, standard cells and resistances, standard condensers, and other pieces of apparatus for minor tests, it contains numerous pieces of the very best construction. Such are the Wolff Potentiometer, the Siemens and Halske Thomson Double Bridge, the Koepsel Permeameter, the Duddell Double Projection Oscillograph, the Station Photometer with Lummer-Brodhun screen, the Carey-Foster Bridge and others. For the work in machine testing there are a number of direct current generators and motors, series, shunt and compound, an interpole motor, a double current generator, a two-phase alternator, a General Electric experimental test set for alternating current, comprising a generator furnishing single, two, three, six or twelve-phase current, and, in addition, offering three types of induction motors with all necessary starting and controlling devices, a single-phase repulsion motor, a two-phase induction motor, two three-phase induction motors, several pairs of constant voltage transformers, a constant current transformer, frequency meters, power factor indicator, synchronism indicator, ground detector and the auxiliary apparatus used in testing these machines. The laboratory has been arranged with a system of universal plug and receptacle connections to facilitate the setting up of all experimental combinations. The laboratory work is carried on by the students in squads or groups of two or three and is so arranged that each student will become familiar with all the details and connections of each particular test. A most important feature of the laboratory instruction is the required preparation of a preliminary report on each experiment before the actual test is carried out. These preliminary reports are written up in the classroom at assigned hours and consist of a complete rÃ©sumÃ© of the test under discussion. The object, the theory, the scheme of connections necessary, the choice of measuring instruments and all auxiliary devices needful for the proper performance of the experiment are here worked out and this preliminary report is handed in for correction or approval. After approval, the test is assigned for a definite laboratory hour and the work is then carried through. A final report is then handed in consisting of the preliminary and the additional data in tabulated and in graphical form. Such a final report comprises a complete text on any given experiment and will prove of great value in later work in commercial fields. It is recognized that the outlined method for laboratory work is of the greatest benefit to the student inasmuch as it requires a thorough understanding of each given test, and at the same time inculcates habits of self-reliance and a spirit of originality which can not prove to be other than beneficial in the later work when the engineer must rely to a great extent upon his own ingenuity. BUILDINGS. The buildings devoted wholly or in part to the work of the Department of Engineering are the following: The Mechanical Laboratory is the main seat of the instruction in technical studies. It is 180 by 70 feet and contains on the main floor the Dean's office and the offices of the three other professors; the main lecture-room; the laboratory of electrical engineering; and the drafting-room for the First and Second-Year students. Above are a smaller drafting-room for advanced students, and blue-print and photographic rooms. Below on the ground floor are another classroom, the testing laboratories, the wood shop, the metal shop, apparatus and storerooms, the toolroom, and the students' lavatory. The Power House is a single-story building 110 by 40 feet. In addition to the university boiler plant and the electric lighting plant, this contains the foundry and the forge-room. The boiler plant consists of two horizontal return-tubular boilers, each of 140 horse-power. The lighting plant consists of three electric generators directly connected to high-speed engines, the respective capacities being 25, 50, and 75 kilowatts. The whole plant is available for purposes of instruction, study and experiment. The Laboratory of General Chemistry, situated at the southern end of West Range, is one of the older buildings recently remodelled and fitted up for the work of instruction in undergraduate chemistry. It is furnished with all the necessary apparatus and supplies, and is comfortably heated and lighted. The engineering students, who are taught in a separate section, have three hours in lecture each week and six hours in the laboratory. The work is specially adapted to their needs. The room used for work in Organic Chemistry is at the northern end of West Range. The Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry is 150 by 60 feet. It is a single-story building, containing the lecture-rooms, the laboratory of analytical chemistry, the rooms for assaying, the balance-rooms, the offices and private laboratories of the professor of Industrial and Analytical Chemistry, and a number of storerooms. These contain not only the usual laboratory supplies, but an extensive collection of specimens, illustrating very completely the processes and products of industrial chemistry, and of especial interest to engineering students. The Geological Museum is 120 by 50 feet. It is a three-story building. The main floor is devoted to the very extensive geological collection of specimens, charts, relief maps, and so on. The gallery above contains an equally good collection of minerals and numerous models of typical crystallographic forms. The upper floor contains the lecture-rooms and the laboratories of Economic Geology. In the basement are stored subsidiary collections and new material accumulated in more recent geological surveys. The Physical Laboratory faces the Mechanical Laboratory on the opposite side of the quadrangle, and has almost the same proportions. The main floor contains the lecture-room, the professors' offices, the laboratory of experimental physics, and the storeroom for the very large collection of apparatus used in the lectures. On the ground floor is the laboratory of theoretical electricity, the storage battery room, a well-equipped shop for the repair and manufacture of apparatus, and numerous smaller rooms for the work of graduate students.
