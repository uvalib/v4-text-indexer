      <field name="fulltext">Alfred Henry Byrd The Byrd family played a distinguished part in the early development of Virginia and it is very meet that a collection of Virginiana should bear the name of one of that family. Colonel William Byrd, the second of the name, was perhaps the most polished and cultivated gentleman of his time, and he left behind him some writings showing his rare culture. When Alfred Henry Byrd died at the early age of thirty-one, the family thought that the savings from his law practice, amounting to about ten thousand dollars, should be consecrated to some noble purpose in his memory, and so a deed of gift was made as soon as the estate was settled, and this catalogue represents the purchases made in the years which have elapsed since the creation of the trust fund. Alfred Henry Byrd was the son of George Harrison Byrd and Lucy Carter Wickham, his wife, and was born at Baltimore on the twentyninth of January, 1866. Not many years afterwards his father removed to New York. Alfred attended a school established in New York City by Virginius Dabney, a brilliant scholar and charming man. After a time spent at this school, he was sent to the Shenandoah Valley Academy in Winchester. After a short stay there, he went to a school in Petersburg, Virginia, under the guidance of W. Gordon McCabe, that elegant scholar and splendid teacher. He went from McCabe's School to the University of Virginia, where he took the degree of Master of Arts in June, 1887. He began the study of law in the University of Virginia, but did not remain for graduation. He entered the Columbia Law School in the City of New York and was graduated Bachelor of Law in 1889. After a short apprenticeship with the firm of Wheeler &amp; Peckham, his health was seriously affected and he took a vacation of a year, working with the engineering corps of the Norfolk and Western Railway Company. He returned with health restored to New York and soon became a partner in the practice of the law with the author of this sketch under the name of Harrison &amp; Byrd. He died on December 5th, 1897, of typhoid fever contracted on a hunting trip. It is difficult to set forth the wonderful charm of manner of Alfred Byrd or to express in adequate terms the strength of his intellect. Blessed by nature with a handsome and speaking countenance, with a grace of manner which attracted men and women alike, with an acute logical mind capable of grasping the most difficult questions and presenting a sound and safe solution, he seemed a man destined to attain fame and eminence in his chosen profession. He left behind him a beautiful memory. His portrait hangs on the walls of his Alma Mater, a tribute of the love of his faithful friends. Robert Lewis Harrison. New York, April 29, 1914.</field>
