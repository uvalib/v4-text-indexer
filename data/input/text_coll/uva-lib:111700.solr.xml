      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE IN the preparation of this work, the authors have endeavored to present, for the information of the reading public, a clear, concise narration of the events which stand out conspicuously in the history of the subjects treated. Unnecessary and uninteresting details have been omitted, and prominence given to such events only as may be considered as having exerted a marked influence in shaping the progress of the county and the up-building of the city. Necessarily, in the limited compass of the work, all the factors which have contributed to the development of the county, and that of the city, cannot be treated at length; but such data as are embodied in these compilations of the History of Roanoke County and Roanoke City have been gleaned from sources deemed authentic and reliable. The authors have also made careful research, and have consulted with men prominent in the affairs of the county and the city, in order to be assured of the accuracy of their work. The history of Roanoke County contains a topographical description of the county, portrays the life of the early settlers and their combats with the Indians; describes the industrial growth of the county, its achievements in war, and the leading events in the history of this section of Southwest Virginia since the formation of Orange County in 1734. It contains much valuable information not heretofore published, and should prove of especial interest in the study of local history. The history of Roanoke City deals with the important events which may be said to constitute the landmarks of its progress from an insignificant hamlet of a few hundred inhabitants to the present progressive city, teeming with life and energy, renowned for its enterprise, and with a record of achievements which are the pride of its people. The importance of the history of a city cannot be measured solely by the length of years, but rather by the prominence the city occupies, the nature of its accomplishments, its present institutions, its prospects for future expansion, and the moral, intellectual, and material influence which it exerts. In these respects, it may be truly stated that the city of Roanoke stands preöminent, and is destined to wield a still greater influence in the years to come. In the presentation of the history of the Norfolk Western Railway Company, the growth of this im- public-service corporation is depicted, from the inception of the several short lines which were projected in the early "fifties," to the present time. It describes chronologically, and in sequence, the important events connected with the early history of the roads which were eventually merged into the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad; the acquisition of that line by the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company, the building of the Shenandoah Valley line to Roanoke, and the subsequent acquisition and building of other important branches, until the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway system is now one of the most important trunk lines of railway in the country. The first discovery of coal which led to tangible results is narrated, as well as the part which the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company has taken in the development of the territory traversed by its lines, and the transformation of a vast area of Southwest Virginia and West Virginia from a wilderness into one of the most fertile and productive sections of the land. A description of the magnitude of its business, with its many ramifications, all intimately associated with, and bearing an important relation to, the prosperity of the country, is manifestly of high interest; as it is the story of a stupendous work of railroad construction, which has been of the highest importance and of incalculable benefit to the public. The descriptive matter, relating to the various institutions which are part and parcel of the growth of the county and of the city, contains data intended to show their relationship to the development of the section and the part they have borne in its material expansion. The biographical sketches of men identified with the progress of the county and city constitute personal annals which should prove of special value, as they are recitals of the careers of men of enterprise, thrift, and energy; records of their aspirations, undertakings, and attainments, and emphasize, the rewards of industry, perseverance, and application. Acknowledgment is made to the "Annals of Augusta," Bruce's "Southwest Virginia and Shenandoah Valley," Brock's "History of Roanoke County," Howe's "Virginia Antiquities," McCauley's "History of Roanoke County," Hale's "Trans-Alleghany Pioneers" and Foote's "Notes," from which publications much valuable information was secured in the preparation of this work.

      <field name="fulltext">HISTORY OF ROANOKE COUNTY By GEORGE S. JACK THREE hundred and five years ago a little fleet left the British Isles, and on board were one hundred and five persons who were leaving the shores of the Old World, to establish homes amid the wilds of the New. They saw the coast line of England and the blue hills of Ireland fade away in the distance, when thoughts of the land that gave them birth gave place to those of that unknown country for which they were bound. For months they were tossed by the billows of the stormy Atlantic, and finally passed into what is now known as the Chesapeake Bay. Captain Newport, in command of the expedition, named the points on either side to the bay's entrance Charles and Henry, in honor of the King's two sons. It was in the month of May in the year 1607, and on every side the forests bloomed with rare and fragrant flowers, while the ears of the newcomers were filled with the songs of birds, many species of which they had never seen nor heard in England. Ascending the bay, they entered the mouth of a magnificent river, called by the natives Powhatan, but by them named the James, in honor of King James I of England. They proceeded up the stream a distance of fifty miles. Anchor was cast opposite a peninsula on the northern banks, and the emigrants landing, laid the foundation of Jamestown, the first permanent English speaking settlement in the New World. A month later, Captain Newport sailed away and left the little colony; in its front lay the stormy Atlantic, three thousand miles in width, while in its rear was a vast and unknown continent, the home of wild beasts and wilder men. Six months later the flowers had disappeared, the birds had flown, the malaria of the swamps had produced a fatal contagion, and of those who composed the colony at landing in May, more were dead than living. The following year additional emigrants and supplies arrived, and from that date the supremacy of an English colony on the shores of Virginia was assured. The population rapidly increased and other settlements were formed. In three decades Virginia was divided into eight shires or counties similar to those in England; viz., James City, Henrico, Charles City, Elizabeth City, Warwick River, Warrasquyoke (now Isle of Wight), Charles River, and Accomack. The tide of emigration continued to flow westward, and the formation of other counties followed in rapid succession; viz., Nansemond in 1639; Northampton, 1642; Northumberland, 1648; Surry, 1652; Westmoreland, 1653; New Kent, 1654; Stafford and Middlesex, 1675; Princess Anne, King and Queen, and Norfolk, 1691; and Richmond and Essex, 1692. These were the minor divisions in 1700. West of the Blue Ridge When the eighteenth century was ushered in the boldest adventurer had not attempted to penetrate the illimitable wilderness west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. Only a vague idea had been obtained from the savages of some mighty flowing river or lofty mountain range. It was not until the year 1716 that Alexander Spottswood, a Lieutenant Governor of the colony, equipped a body of horsemen and set out from Williamsburg, pursuing the general course of the James River, until they stood on the summit of the Blue Ridge near the point where it breaks through the rocky barrier. A resolution was formed to wrest the beautiful valley from its savage occupants, in order that it might become the home of civilization. A half dozen families formed the first settlement west of the Blue Ridge, near where Winchester now stands, in 1732. Prior to this time Thomas Marlin and John Salling resolved to know something more of the country, and journeying up the Valley, crossed the James River and proceeded on to the Roanoke River at a point near where Salem now stands, a fuller account of their explorations being given under the caption, "First Explorers of the Roanoke Valley." Settlements were soon formed throughout the Valley of Virginia, and in an effort to keep civil government abreast of her most adventurous pioneers, Orange County was organized in 1734, including within its confines Virginia's vast western domain, and in this county the dwellers of the frontier were included until 1738, when all that portion west of the Blue Ridge became the county of West Augusta. Virginia was rapidly increasing in population and influence. The tide of immigration was westward and southwestward. South of the James on the Roanoke, and still further into the forest to the banks of the Holston River, the hardy pioneers had sought a home. Over the Alleghanies the smoke ascended from the cabins of the men who blazed the way and civilization was rapidly extending over the wilds of West Augusta. The western boundary of the great territory extended by enactment of the House of Burgesses to the Mississippi River, and by the Treaty of Paris, in 1763, the territory History of Roanoke County of Michigan and Missouri were included in the confines of Augusta County. Formation of Botetourt More than three decades passed away and brought with them the year 1769, and with it came the formation of Botetourt County, named for Lord Botetourt, a provincial governor of Virginia, the county being formed for the convenience of those who had settled in the Southwest. Botetourt County comprised all of the territory originally in the county of Augusta west of the Blue Ridge Mountains with the possible exception of that included in the far west, for the reason that the western boundary line was left indeterminate and was to be fixed by the County Court. In order that the organization of the new county may be more fully understood, the full text of the Act forming Botetourt is given as follows: "An Act for dividing the County and Parish of Augusta, and for adding certain islands in the Fluvanna River, to the counties of Albemarle and Amherst. "1. Whereas, many inconveniences attend the inhabitants of the county and parish of Augusta, by reason of the great extent thereof, and the said inhabitants have petitioned this General Assembly that the said county and parish may be divided: Be it therefore enacted, by the Governor, Council, and Burgesses, of this present General Assembly, and it is hereby enacted, by the authority of the same, That from and after the thirty-first day of January next ensuing, the said county and parish of Augusta be divided into two counties and parishes, by a line beginning at the Blue Ridge, running north fifty-five degrees west, to the confluence of Mary's Creek, or the South River, with the north branch of James River, thence up the same to the mouth of Carr's Creek, thence up the said creek to the mountain, thence north fifty-five degrees west, as far as the courts of the two counties shall extend it; and that all that part of the said county and parish which lies on the south side of the said line shall be one distinct county and parish, and called and known by the name of Botetourt; and that all the other part thereof, which is on the north side of the said line, shall be one other distinct county and parish, and retain the name of Augusta." There is nothing in the records to show how far westward the boundary line extended, but a clause in the enabling Act provided as follows: "And, whereas the people situated on the Mississippi, in the said county of Botetourt, will be very remote from the courthouse, and must necessarily become a separate county as soon as their numbers are sufficient, which will probably happen in a short time; Be it therefore enacted by the authority aforesaid, that the inhabitants of that part of said county of Botetourt which lies on the said waters shall be exempted from the payment of any levies to be laid by the said County Court for the purpose of building a courthouse and prison for said county." Area Reduced in 1772 This further division of Botetourt's territory is included in the following: "An Act for dividing the County of Botetourt into two distinct counties. "1. Whereas, it is represented to this present General Assembly, by the inhabitants and settlers on the waters of Holston and New rivers, in the county of Botetourt, that they labor under great inconveniences, by reason of the extent of the said county, and their remote situation from the courthouse: Be it therefore enacted, by the Governor, Council, and Burgesses of this present General Assembly, and it is hereby enacted, by the authority of the same, That from and after the first day of December next the said county of Botetourt shall be divided into two distinct counties, that is to say, all that part of the said county within a line to run up the east side of New River to the mouth of Culberson's Creek, thence a direct line to the Catawba road, where it crosses the dividing ridge, between the north fork of Roanoke and the waters of New River, thence with the top of the ridge to the bent where it turns eastwardly, thence a south course, crossing Little River, to the top of the Blue Ridge Mountains, shall be established as one distinct county, and called and known by the name of Fincastle; and all that other part thereof, which lies to the east and northeast of the said line, shall be one other distinct county, and retain the name of Botetourt." Fincastle County lost its identity after four years of existence, and in 1776, by an Act of the General Assembly, the counties of Montgomery, Washington, and Kentuckie were formed from its original territory. The name "Fincastle," however, was retained by Botetourt in her county seat, the capital of that county having the distinction of being the oldest town in America west of the Blue Ridge, the name being derived from Fine Castle, the English country estate of Lord Botetourt. Formation of Roanoke County Roanoke County was established by an Act of the Virginia Legislature passed March 30th, 1838, and was formed from territory originally comprised in Botetourt County. It was in 1830 that the people History of Roanoke County of the Roanoke Valley began to feel the want of a new county organization, and the question was agitated by leading citizens of the section. The first movements met with strong opposition from Montgomery County, situated directly on the west, and from Fincastle, the county seat of Botetourt, also from the lower end of the mother county. The General Assembly was petitioned at its session of 1829-30, and in the following year, 1831, an Act was passed framing a new county from portions of Montgomery and Botetourt. The Senate of Virginia rejected the bill on account of its being unconstitutional, due to the fact that the apportionment of the legislative representation from the four geographical divisions of the State would be unsettled. The people, however, were not discouraged, but set to work, more determined than ever to separate from the mother county. Salem, then a town of thirty-five years' standing, had attained much importance, and being centrally located was naturally the proper place for the county seat. John F. J. White, an influential Salem merchant, warmly advocated the formation of Roanoke County. John McCauley, a former representative in the General Assembly from Montgomery County, but who had recently moved to Salem, was sent as an agent to Richmond to exert his influence in securing the desired legislation. For seven years the agitation was kept up, and the residents of the upper portion of the county resolved to make a decisive and final endeavor. As an evidence of the deep interest manifested, the legislature was memorialized by the submission of the following document assigning the principal reasons for the division: "First. Because that portion which desires to be made into a new county forms a separate and distinct community, being bound together by geographical position, as also by interest and feeling. "Second. Because the people are on the subject perfectly and wholly united, in the bounds of the petitioning district. "Third. Because nearly fifteen hundred freemen and seven hundred voters demand it; they being a clear majority of the county; and it is presumable that a large portion of the residue are neutral. "Fourth. Because in their present situation, they are measurably debarred the privileges of freemen, disfranchised, and have recently had an odious land tax of fifty per cent. laid upon them for the exclusive benefit of a remote and minor part of the county, including Fincastle, the county seat, without their consent and to their entire prejudice. "Fifth. Because of the unjust and improper influence of Fincastle on other portions of the county, making those parts mere `hewers of wood and drawers of water.' "Sixth. Because of the ability of this portion of Botetourt to form a county, as it is shown by the Commissioner's books to have paid into the treasury nearly $1,800.00. "Seventh. Because of the size, population, and wealth of the petitioning district, as it is in point of territory from north to south upwards of thirty miles, and from east to west upwards of fifteen; in population, nearly six thousand; and admitted to be immensely wealthy. "Eighth. Because, in granting their request, you do them but sheer justice, invade no one's rights, and leave the present seat of justice in the center of a dense population, territorially about twenty-four miles square. "Ninth. Because it is emphatically a Roanoke County, the whole or nearly the whole of it being washed by the Roanoke or its tributaries. "Tenth. Because of the great distance of many of the petitioners from the present seat of justice. "Eleventh. Because it will put an end to the legislation on this long mooted and vexing question, and at once enable these two communities to agree as neighbors, which they cannot do whilst belonging to the same household. "Twelfth. Because of the universally admitted propriety and expediency of the measure by all who pass through this rich and beautiful region." This petition, together with the active work of prominent citizens, had the desired effect. Boundary Line The Act of the General Assembly in defining the boundary lines of Roanoke County reads as follows: "Be it Enacted by the General Assembly, That all that part of the county of Botetourt lying next to and adjoining the counties of Montgomery, Franklin, and Bedford, in the southwestern part thereof, and contained within the following boundary lines; to wit: Beginning at a point on the Blue Ridge in the line which divides the counties of Bedford and Botetourt, thence northwest to the house, now the residence of John Bonsack, on Glade Creek, so as to include the said Bonsack in the new county, thence a line to the house of Thomas Barnes, including the said Barnes in the new county, and so as to leave John W. Thompson in the county of Botetourt, thence a straight line crossing the Catawba Valley at a point one mile due north of Mrs. Garwood's, thence crossing Craig's Creek (passing the house of John Spessard on Craig's Creek, so as to leave the said Spessard in the old county) to the History of Roanoke County top of the mountain which divides the waters of Craig's Creek and Sinking Creek, thence westwardly along the top of the mountain to a point where the lines of Botetourt, Montgomery, and Giles counties meet, thence with the line which divides the county of Botetourt from the county of Montgomery, to the point at which said line joins the line of Franklin County, thence with the Franklin and Botetourt line to the point at which said line joins the Bedford line, thence with the Bedford line to the beginning, shall form one distinct and new county, and shall be called and known by the name of Roanoke County." Origin of the Name The name "Roanoke" is of Indian origin. In a vocabulary of Indian words and phrases prepared by Captain John Smith, the real founder of the Virginia Colony, he gives "Rawrenock," which signifies white beads. Hugh Jones, author of "The Present State of Virginia," says the name "Roenoak" was applied to the "white shells with holes which the Indians wore on strings about their arms and necks." These shells also passed as "current coin" among the natives. The name given the new county was an historic one. It was first applied to an island on the coast of North Carolina, on which Sir Walter Raleigh attempted to found the first English settlement in America. The name will go down in American history as one of the most noted and widely known of all the names familiar to students of American history. It was later applied to the river which rises in the Alleghany Mountains and flows eastwardly, dividing the county, and which empties into Albemarle Sound, near Roanoke Island. The name was also adopted by Roanoke City, the marvelous development of which has excited the wonder and admiration of the whole country, growing in less than a third of a century from a hamlet of a few hundred people to more than thirty-five thousand population. The name will be perpetuated in modern history as the synonym of progress and industrial enterprise. First County Commissioners The first County Commissioners named were Albert G. Pendleton, of Giles County, Hamilton Wade, of Montgomery County, Daniel Smith, of Kanawha, and William Campbell, Sr., of Bedford. They met in the town of Salem on May 10th, 1838, or shortly thereafter, and determined the site for the courthouse for the new county. The amount of land acquired for the necessary public buildings was not to exceed two acres, and they were required to ascertain the value thereof. It was also enacted by the General Assembly that William Anderson, of Botetourt, Archibald Goodykoontz, of Montgomery, and John F. J. White, of Botetourt, be appointed commissioners to run and mark the lines between the counties of Roanoke and Botetourt. The County Justices Eighteen county justices of the peace were commissioned by the Governor for the new county and were as follows: Elijah McClanahan, Nathaniel Burwell, Thomas Fowler, Lewis Harvey, William McDermid, James Kyle, John H. Griffin, William C. Bowyer, Elias Thomas, Andrew Reynolds, Absalom Smith, John F. J. White, Joseph Woods, George W. Shanks, Michael Miller, William Farley, Thomas Tosh, John McCauley, and John R. Richardson. These justices, with the exception of William Farley, met at Salem on the twenty-first day of May, 1838, at the house occupied by Benjamin Faris as a tavern, but owned by Charles Dillard, and proceeded in accordance with the provisions of the Act of formation to organize a county court. Faris's Tavern stood on the site now occupied by the Presbyterian Church. Organization of First Court The first court in Roanoke County was organized by the election or appointment of the following officers: Clerk of the County Court, William M. Cook; Sheriff, Colonel Elijah McClanahan; Deputy Sheriffs, Jeremiah K. Pitzer and Rufus Pitzer; Commissioner of the Revenue, Armistead Neal; Commonwealth's Attorney of the County Court, James B. Watts; Commonwealth's Attorney of the Circuit Court, General Edward Watts; Jailer, James C. Huff. Madison Pitzer and Henry Frantz were nominated by the county justices to the Governor for the office of Coroner, but the records do not show that the appointees ever qualified. First County Court The first session of the County Court was held on May 24th, 1838, at the home of James C. Huff, and the sessions of both the County and Circuit Courts were held there for a period of three years, when the courthouse was completed. This building was recently torn away to make room for the new and modern structure, one of the finest temples of justice in the State. The following attorneys qualified to practice law at the first term of the court: Edward Johnston, John T. Anderson, Francis T. Anderson, Alexander P. Eskridge, James B. Watts, and John B. I. Logan. First Circuit Court The first term of the Circuit Court convened August 25th, 1838, and was presided over by Judge History of Roanoke County John J. Allen, one of the judges of the general court, and attorneys qualified to practice as follows: Edward Watts, James L. Woodville, Edward Johnston, John T. Anderson, John B. I. Logan, William M. Cook, Robert M. Hudson, and Robert Craig. First County Clerk William M. Cook, the first Clerk, held the office for eight years, when he resigned, and Frederick Johnston, who during this time had been Clerk of the Circuit Court, was chosen as his successor. Mr. Johnston filled both positions most acceptably until 1865, or for nearly twenty years. First County Jailer Mr. James C. Huff, the first Jailer, was appointed June 22d, 1838, and held the office until the date of his death in 1877. The first jail was built on the present site, but was burned down in later years by a colored prisoner, who set it on fire in an effort to escape, and he came near perishing in the flames. Annexes New Territory In 1849 a part of the county of Montgomery was annexed to the county of Roanoke. The Annexation Act was passed February 2d, 1849. It included that part of Montgomery lying next to Roanoke, the new line beginning at the point where the counties of Giles, Botetourt, Montgomery, and Roanoke corner, and running thence in a straight line to the house where Redman Eakin lived, leaving Eakin in Montgomery County, unless he should direct the surveyor to leave him in Roanoke, thence to the Roanoke River, crossing it at the bridge west of Charles Thomas's, thence a straight line to the Puncheon Camp on Bent Mountain, including the Puncheon Camp in Roanoke County, thence to a point on the line which divides the counties of Floyd and Montgomery, at or near the house owned by Joseph King, but which was in that year occupied by James Puckett. The line so drawn is the present western boundary line of Roanoke County. Formation of Craig County In 1851 the people of Craig County felt that they wanted independent county sovereignty, and on March 21st of that year an Act was passed forming the new county of Craig from parts of Roanoke, Botetourt, Giles, and Monroe. The new county was named "Craig" after the creek by that name which flows through it, and not after Colonel Robert Craig, as many suppose. Colonel Craig was for many years a prominent lawyer of Roanoke County, and represented the county in the Legislature and the district in the national House of Representatives. He owned and resided on a farm on Roanoke River, a short distance west of Salem. William M. Cook, of Roanoke County, was one of the commissioners appointed to select a site for the courthouse, jail, and other public buildings of the new county. Roanoke County's Earliest History McCauley's History of Roanoke County says: "It is a matter of great regret to all interested in the early history of this section of the State that the sources of information are so meager, and the little which has come down to us by tradition is of such a fragmentary and unsatisfactory character. The pioneers were men of deeds and not of words; men who for the most part made their `sign manual' with the sword and axe and not with the pen; who made, not wrote, history. They were too busy with the stern tasks of subduing the native wilderness of these mountains and valleys, and fighting savage foes, to place on record the story of their adventures and struggles. Much in the form of letters and tradition has perished with them. Had these been preserved, they would have formed an interesting chapter in our local annals." First Explorers of Roanoke Valley About the year 1726, Thomas Marlin, a peddler, and John Salling, a weaver, set out on an exploring expedition toward the southwest, a region then almost unknown. They proceeded from the settlement at Winchester, and passed up the valley of the Shenandoah on foot until they reached James River, which they crossed, and proceeded through the forests in a southwesterly direction until they reached the Roanoke River, probably in the vicinity where Roanoke now stands. These two adventurous spirits were surprised by a band of Cherokee Indians and Salling was made prisoner while Marlin escaped. These are the first two white men known to history to penetrate the Roanoke Valley and spy out the land. The glowing reports made by Marlin, who returned to the valley of the Shenandoah, induced others to come to this favored section. Salling was carried into Tennessee by the Indians, where he became domesticated and adopted their mode of living. Whilst on a hunting expedition in Kentucky, he was captured by a band of Indians from Illinois. He was taken to Kaskaskia, where an old squaw adopted him as her son. He accompanied the Indians on many expeditions, going once to the Gulf of Mexico. After being held captive for two years, he was sold to some Spaniards who wanted him for an interpreter. After six years of captivity, he was ransomed by the Governor of Canada and allowed to return home. History of Roanoke County He made his way back to Williamsburg in Virginia, where he met with John Lewis, of Augusta, and an Irish emigrant named John Mackey. They were doubtless impressed with Salling's description of the "land flowing with milk and honey" which he had seen in his western travels, and were inspired with a desire to obtain possession of the rich lands which lay along the rivers. Mackey settled near Staunton, while Salling, fond of the wilderness, pitched his habitation on the outposts of civilization, building his cabin at the forks of the James River. His reconnoitering expedition with Marlin revealed the land of promise in the Roanoke Valley, with its silvery streams, its fertile river bottoms covered with giant growth of walnut, ash, and sycamore, its plains waving with rank herbage grazed by herds of buffalo, and its hills crowned by dense forests of oak and pine. But a few years elapsed before the pioneers came in to take possession of all these riches. It was not until after the year 1770 that the rich Catawba Valley was settled. A large number of people came, including many of the forbears of a large number of the most prominent citizens of the county of to-day. Early Land Grants The early land grants of Roanoke County are indicative of the first settling of this section of Virginia. Many of the grants have retained in some manner or other the names of the grantees, and important points in the county to this day are known by the original grants. A history of the county would be incomplete without detailing a few of the more important grants, which are as follows: December 15th, 1740, to James McAfee, Sr., three hundred acres. This land was at the north of "McAfee's Knob," the highest mountain peak in the county. In the same neighborhood, two tracts of three hundred and fifty acres were granted to Robert Poague, and conveyed to James McAfee February 17th, 1748. Erected on the lands of James McAfee was a fort, which was doubtless used at some time as a dwelling. It was torn down some twenty-five or thirty years ago. It was at this fort that the first white child was born within the limits of the county, a member of James McAfee's family, in 1764. On July 25th, 1746, one hundred and fifty acres was granted to James Carvin on Carvin's Creek. A number of grants were made to Thomas Tosh from 1747 to 1767. He was an ancestor of the late Colonel Thomas Lewis and Major Andrew Lewis, both having recently died. In September, 1748, three grants of four hundred acres were made to Mark Evans. The place was called "Cedar Spring" and was known as the "Naked Farm," afterwards called the "Barrens." "Cedar Spring" is the source of "Lick Run," which passes through Roanoke City, and is now owned by Joseph Moomaw. The land included in this grant embraced a large portion of the estate of General Edward Watts and was called "Oaklands," now better known as "The Watts Farm," just north of the city of Roanoke. On November 3d, 1750, eight hundred and forty-five acres of land lying on both sides of Tinker Creek was granted to James Patton. Two tracts of sixty-six and fifty-four acres, respectively, on Tinker Creek were granted to Israel Christian, who donated the site on which Fincastle stands on June 27th, 1764. His son, General William Christian, figured conspicuously in the Indian wars of Virginia and Kentucky. Christiansburg, the county seat of Montgomery County, was named after Israel Christian. On May 12th, 1759, two hundred and twelve acres were granted to Ervin Patterson, and on September 10th, 1765, an additional three hundred acre tract was granted to the same party. Both tracts were south of Roanoke River, and some thirty years ago were owned by Ferdinand Rorer, and is known as "Solitude." Other early grants were as follows: April 6th, 1769, three tracts on Catawba to John Armstrong. April 6th, 1769, three hundred and eight acres near Tinker Creek to Robert Breckenridge. February 1st, 1780, one hundred and fifty acres near Back Creek to Robert McIlhenny. May 1st, 1784, one hundred and eighty-eight acres to Robert McIlhenny. September 1st, 1782, thirty-five acres on Catawba to John Ledgerwood. November 18th, 1786, one thousand three hundred and eighty acres near "Sugar Loaf Knob" to James Neelly. September 3d, 1791, one thousand and eighty-three acres on Peters Creek at its mouth to John Neelly. April 16th, 1792, one thousand one hundred and seventy acres on Mason's Creek to William Carlton. December 5th, 1794, one thousand five hundred acres on Tinker Creek to William Anderson. September 6th, 1799, one hundred acres on Carvin's Creek to Benjamin Denton. November 20th, 1800, two hundred acres on Catawba to John Ledgerwood. December 14th, 1805, three hundred and twenty-one acres on Tinker Creek to Peter Noftzinger. First Furnace in County Among the early grants was one from King George to Colonel Robert Harvey for services in the History of Roanoke County Indian wars, for a boundary of ten thousand acres of land in the vicinity of Starkey station, on the Winston-Salem division of the Norfolk &amp; Western. Colonel Harvey established an iron furnace on Back Creek as early as 1749, and with a forge worked iron until 1812, when the furnace and forge were washed away by the biggest flood ever known in that section of the county. It is a well established fact that the ore which supplied this furnace was taken from the Rorer mines, and it is certain that these mines were worked at least one hundred and fifty years ago. Colonel Robert Harvey was the great grandfather of T. M. Starkey, who lived on a portion of the Harvey grant, and whose residence was in plain view of the old furnace site. These grants represent only a partial list of land grants in the county between the years 1740 and 1805, but they indicate the time at which settlements were made in the great Roanoke Valley. These grants were backed by treasury warrants and letters patent, either of which indicated that the owner had come to stay provided the Indians would let him. County's First Settlement There is nothing by which the exact date of the first settlement can be determined. It was probably about 1740 that the first settlers began to build their cabins along the water courses and in the fertile valleys. It is not known who was the first hardy pioneer to pitch his tent within the borders of Roanoke County. McCauley's History of Roanoke County says: "It may have been James McAfee, who built his strong block house on the Catawba. It may have been William Carvin, who settled in sight of the picturesque "Tinker Knob." It may have been James Burke, who reared his cabin by "Burke Spring," south of Roanoke River, on the tract recently owned by the Salem Development Company. It may have been Mark Evans, who made his home beside "Cedar Springs," and became owner of those rich lands which in after years formed an estate equal in extent and value to the lordly seat of an English nobleman. None of the descendants of these worthies remain to inherit their ancestral acres. Like the aboriginal owners, who hunted the deer and buffalo amidst rich glades and "oak openings," and made their forays across the border to pillage and massacre the hated pale faces, they are gone. Their names have been almost forgotten, and only perpetuated in the names of mountains and streams, which have come to us from these remote times, in `McAfee's Knob,' `Carvin's Creek,' `Mason's Creek,' `Peters' Creek,' `Evans' Spring Branch,' and `Burke's Old Place.' " It is stated that in 1740 there was not a hunter's cabin southwest of Otter River, in Bedford County. Continuing, McCauley says: "Whoever these first settlers were, we know that living in that `debatable land' on the border, which extended from the Potomac to the Holston, they were subjected to that terrible storm of fire and blood which again and again swept over the infant settlement. In that bloody era from 1754 to 1764 they lived in constant dread of the terrible warwhoop which announced the onslaught of tomahawk and scalping knife. The massacres and captures at `Draper's Meadows' (now Blacksburg), Vass's Fort, on the south fork of the Roanoke, and `Greenfield,' had their counterpart in the raids into the Roanoke and Catawba valleys." Catawba Valley Settlements It was about the year 1770, although the exact date cannot be ascertained, that several families located in the Catawba Valley. This was subsequent to the first settlement there for the reason that some six years before the valley was raided by the Indians, a more complete account of which will be found elsewhere in this work. The earliest land grant extant, so far as can be determined by any existing records, was that to James McAfee, Sr., on December 15th, 1740, for three hundred acres of land in the Catawba Valley, at the northern base of McAfee's Knob, the highest point of land in the county. In this same section, three hundred and fifty acres were granted to Robert Poage, of Augusta County, which he sold to James McAfee, February 17th, 1748. On the first tract of three hundred and fifty acres James McAfee built his house. Within the memory of some of the oldest citizens of the section, an old house stood for many years on this land, which tradition says was used as a fort. It bore many bullet marks, indicating that it had been used as a place of defense and protection from the Indians. It was built of logs, the chimney being of stone with a wide fireplace, such as was needed to warm the large number of settlers who were forced at times to seek refuge from marauding bands of Indians. The old fort house was torn down about a quarter of a century ago. A member of James McAfee's family, said to be the first white child born in the present confines of Roanoke County, was born in this house, the notable birth taking place soon after the destruction of the first settlements in 1764. Among the families settling later in this beautiful valley may be mentioned the Philipses, Woodses, Spessards, Larks, Garwoods, Murrays, Atkinses, Beckners, Hammons, Dillmans, Armstrongs, Glenns, and Ledgerwoods. Many of their descendants are living to-day. Unlike the early settlers of the Roanoke Valley, History of Roanoke County their names have been perpetuated in their numerous progeny. In those early days the building of a small cabin and raising a crop of grain of any kind entitled the occupant to four hundred acres of land, and a preemption right to an additional one thousand acres adjoining, to be secured by land office warrant. It is noticeable, however, that most of the land grants were for four hundred acres or less. In the early days there was more of a scarcity of actual settlers than of lands to be settled, and it was probably for that reason that the preömption right was seldom invoked. The Catawba Valley was settled by a sturdy race of pioneers, men from whom sprang many of the county's most progressive, upright, and honorable citizens of later times. In the Catawba Valley, the people are law abiding to such a degree that peace officers are not needed, and it is doubtful if there is another area of like size and population in all of the United States so free from crime. Since the organization of the county but one felony has come under the observation of the County Court, and that happened in 1881, thirty-one years ago, when a negro attempted to assault a little white girl. He was captured by Judge John W. Woods, a native of Catawba, who at the time was a young man. The negro was tried and sentenced to serve eighteen years in State prison. Catawba was directly on the great line of travel from the north, which passed out by Fincastle, the first town established west of the Blue Ridge, thence on to Smithfield, now Blacksburg, and to points in the southwest. Great Indian Trail Along the valleys of Southwest Virginia and East Tennessee lay the Great Indian Trail, or the route of travel between the northern and southern Indians in their hunting excursions, hostile expeditions, and their embassies of peace. This trail, called the "Great Path," passed near the present site of the rock road, extending from Seven Mile Ford, in Smyth County, through Roanoke County and on down the Valley. It ran through Salem and crossed Mason's Creek just north of Pitzer's Cliff, across the hill to Peters' Creek and on by the village of Gainsborough, near where Roanoke City now stands, where the trail divided, one going east across the Blue Ridge near Buford's Gap into Bedford County. The other branch went to the north, passing by the present site of Cloverdale, in Botetourt County, and thence down the Valley. The diverging point of the "Great Trail" became the converging point for pioneers on their westward journeys from the north and east, and it in time became a great center of population. (See History of Roanoke City.) Chain of Forts That there was great need of protection against Indian invasion is fully attested by the long chain of forts which were established by the military authorities of Virginia, extending from Winchester to the Tennessee River. Within the present borders or Roanoke County was Fort Lewis, a name familiar to many people of this county. The stirring incidents of those days have never been recorded, and their history has passed into oblivion, as the walls of the old fort have crumbled into dust. Its name alone remains to tell the story. In the Clerk's Office at Staunton, Virginia, is the record of a meeting of the military authorities, when it was decided to erect a chain of fourteen forts for the protection of the frontier. This "Council of War" was called by Governor Dinwiddie in July, 1756. One of the forts was to be constructed at John Mason's, on the south side of Roanoke River. Just where this fort was located is not known. It is believed to have been in the vicinity of Crystal Spring. Washington's Visit The only occasion on record in which General Washington ever visited Southwest Virginia was the time he went to inspect Vause's Fort on the south fork of the Roanoke River, near where Shawsville now stands. General Washington, on the occasion of this visit, passed through Roanoke County. He was accompanied by Colonel Andrew Lewis and Colonel Thomas Preston. Kerchival, in his "History of the Valley," says: "There was another tradition related to the author by Mrs. Elizabeth Madison, an old lady of great respectability (who at the time she related this incident lived near Vause's Fort). She states the following fact: Several old Indian Chiefs had offered considerable premiums to any warrior or set of warriors who would bring out Washington's scalp. Seven Indians who were living in the neighborhood of Roanoke got to hear that Washington was on his way out to inspect the fort very near the Roanoke River. There were two roads leading to the fort; one across the point of the mountain and the other on the level land. The one across the mountain was the shortest way, the other on the level land the better. The seven Indians placed themselves in ambush close to the side of the level road, and lay concealed two days and nights, but Washington did not pass. They grew impatient, and their chief, the third day, stated that he would go to the other road and ascertain whether Washington had taken that route to the fort—the two roads being only one mile apart. He gave his men positive orders not to fire at any person that might pass in his absence. While he was gone, Colonel Washington, Colonel Lewis, History of Roanoke County and Colonel Preston all three passed close by the enemy without being molested." Roanoke County Taverns There were a number of taverns in Roanoke County, but little is known of their early history. While Roanoke County was still a portion of Botetourt, the prices for all kinds of entertainment were regulated by the County Court. These old taverns form an interesting part of the county's early history. One was known as "The Black Horse," and was situated in the northeastern part of the county near the Botetourt County line, on the road from Old Gainsborough to Fincastle. Another known as the "Mermaid" was in the western part of Salem and stood on the site occupied by the residence of the late Thomas Kasey. It was the chief tavern of the place and around its board gathered many a traveler, as he journeyed from the East to the "far" West. McCauley says: "Could we make a pilgrimage across the country, back to the time when the "Mermaid's" sign creaked on its hinges in front of this tavern, and enter the room on some winter night when a group of travel-stained guests were gathered around the roaring fire, we would doubtless be astonished at the marvelous tales of hairbreadth escapes and `accidents by flood and field' related by the various actors, as they whiled away the passing hours. They would form a chapter before which the tales of `Ye Pilgrims of Ye Olden Time' would seem as mere nursery rhymes for the amusement of children. We can imagine some soldier recounting his experience in the bloody battle of Point Pleasant, or some hunter spinning his yarns of wonderful encounters with the Indians, or of his thrilling adventures with the wild beasts of the forests. We would like to tarry a while, as entertained listeners to these olden time stories, but we must perforce leave the merry group to smoke their pipes and sip their grog, and their honest host `Careful to see the mantling bliss go round,' hoping some modern Chaucer will weave the pilgrim tales into verse for the entertainment of future readers." Early Methods of Travel The stage coach was the method by which the people traveled from one point to another in the early history of Roanoke County. The sturdy team of four, the lumbering stage coach, the driver with whip in hand, the luggage and old-time hair-covered trunks, the mail bags, the curious crowds who would gather at the taverns to witness the arrival and departure of the stages, the crack of the whip, and the dash down the rough roads, through mud and mire, the livelong day, or to the point of relay where a new driver and fresh horses were speedily hitched, forms a part of Roanoke's history. A stage line ran through Roanoke County from Lynchburg and on to the west. It was eagerly awaited day after day along the line. Its near arrival to the village at night was announced by the coachman's horn. The stage brought the mail, the news from the city and other distant points, the weekly newspapers, and anxiously expected letters from distant friends. Early Mode of Living The first houses erected in the Roanoke and Catawba valleys were log cabins, with covers of split clapboards, and were kept in place by weighted poles. The floors were made of split puncheons, hewed smooth on one side. These puncheons were removable, and under them were stored fruits and vegetables for the winter. It was not an uncommon sight in the winter time to see the family gathered at night around a blazing fire, and while some regaled the others with banjo or violin music, one of the floor puncheons was raised and a pail of fine apples brought out from below, and a genuine treat awaited each member of the household. The furniture was handmade and rude. The table furniture consisted of a few pewter dishes, plates, and spoons, but mostly of wooden bowls, trenchers, and noggins. If these were scarce, gourds and hard-shelled squashes made up the deficiency. All iron pots, vessels, knives and forks, as well as salt and iron, were carried on pack horses from the eastern side of the mountains. The food was of the plainest. Hog and hominy was the proverbial dish. Johnny cake and pone were the bread used for most part. Milk and mush was the standard dish for supper. When milk was scarce, as was usually the case, hominy supplied the place of mush. Mush was frequently eaten with sweetened water, bear's oil, or the gravy of fried meat. Truck and garden patches were much in evidence, and the vegetables were usually cooked with venison or bear meat. Owing to the insecure coverings for their feet in winter, most of the early settlers slept with their feet to the fire to prevent rheumatism. Salt was a great object with the first settlers. It was brought in on pack horses. The common price of a bushel of alum salt was a cow and calf. Coffee was not used until after the Revolution. When tea was introduced, it was a puzzle to prepare it. One old lady said she drank the broth and her husband ate the greens. Roanoke County—Topography and Climate Roanoke County is twenty miles in length and about thirteen miles in width, and contains one hundred History of Roanoke County and ninety-five thousand five hundred and eighty-one acres. The surface is undulating and mountainous in some parts, all the boundaries being crests of mountain ranges. The streams of the county run in various directions, part of the water going north into the James, while the Roanoke River flows to the southeast. The county is intersected by a valley extending its whole length from northeast to southwest, with a mean width of about seven miles. There are two narrow valleys on the north, Catawba Valley and Mason's Cove. On the south is the Back Creek Valley. The mountain ranges encircling the Roanoke Valley are picturesque and beautiful, and with their pointed peaks lend a peculiar charm to the landscape. McAfee's Knob, in the Catawba Mountain, reaches an altitude of three thousand feet and is one of the highest points in the county. Two natural curiosities in the vicinity of McAfee's Knob are "Murder Hole" and "The Flowing Spring." Tinker Mountain, near Hollins College, with its regular and singular contour, is an attractive feature in the northeastern end of the county. No matter from what side it is viewed, it presents a singularly like appearance. It resembles an old-fashioned wagon body inverted. Just to the south of Roanoke is Mill Mountain, its name being derived from a mill which formerly stood at its base. Crystal Spring gushes from the foot of this mountain and supplies the city of Roanoke with its crystal waters. On the summit of the mountain is an observatory, which affords an extensive and delightful view. Some eighteen or twenty years ago, a commodious hotel called "The Rockledge" was built on Mill Mountain and completely furnished, but owing to its inaccessibility was not opened to the public until the summer of 1910, when an incline railway was completed to the top of the mountain, which now seems destined to be a famous summer resort. On the south side of the county, rising to the height of three thousand five hundred and sixty-seven feet, is Mason's Knob, while immediately to the south of Salem is the pointed peak of Twelve O'Clock Knob, while at its eastern base rises a small elevation, known from its shape as "Sugar Loaf Mountain." A well-graded road leading from Salem to Back Creek winds its way around the base and over the spurs of Twelve O'Clock Knob, making it easy of access for the lovers of the picturesque and grand in nature. The upper end of the valley is bounded on the north by Fort Lewis Mountain, which extends for a distance of ten miles from Mason's Creek to a point near Lafayette, in Montgomery County. The Roanoke Valley being surrounded as it is by lofty mountains on every side, extreme climatic conditions are practically unknown. Tornadoes never occur and severe winds are rare. The fall and spring months are exceptionally free from heavy frosts, and the thermometer registers, at these periods of the year, an average temperature of from fifty to sixty degrees Fahrenheit. During the summer months the average heat is from seventy-five to eighty-five degrees, and rarely ever reaches ninety during the very hottest weather, and then for a few hours only. The nights are sufficiently cool in summer for the enjoyment of refreshing sleep. The winters are mild and snow rarely ever lies on the ground more than from twenty-four to forty-eight hours. The Roanoke Valley has less average snowfall and of less depth than any of the surrounding country. The winter climate may be termed medium, a happy balance between what may be called a cold or warm climate. From winter's commencement until the ushering in of the new year, the thermometer ranges on an average of from ten degrees below freezing to forty-five or fifty degrees above zero. Only a few days of an entire winter are cold enough to produce ice for storage for use in summer. During these freezing periods the thermometer ranges from ten degrees below freezing to zero, and occasionally in the early morning hours reaches from five to eight degrees below. The spring season begins comparatively early. Grass often remains green all the winter, and vegetation begins to spring up in the latter part of February. Sudden changes of temperature are rare and are never severe like on the western plains. Dr. Charles B. Griffin, of Salem, made careful observations for fifteen years for Salem and vicinity, and the average season temperature was found to be as follows: spring, fifty degrees; summer, seventy-six degrees; fall, sixty-one degrees; winter, forty-one degrees; yearly average, fifty-eight degrees. The rainfall for the same period was, spring, ten inches; summer, fifteen; fall, eleven; winter, ten; yearly average, forty-six inches. Early frosts occur about the middle of October and late frosts the middle of April. The county is well drained by water courses. The Roanoke River flows from one end of the county to the other, besides there are a number of smaller streams, chief among them being Tinker, Mason's, Peters', Carvin's, Catawba, Back, and Glade creeks. Mining Interests of Roanoke County The Rorer Iron Mines, south of Roanoke, have produced a superior quality of iron ore for many years. The Cloverdale Mines yield an excellent grade of raw material. An analysis of twenty-five samples showed the metallic iron to run over fifty-three per cent, while the phosphorus was exceedingly low. History of Roanoke County The Griffin Mines, not far from Salem, have been operated for years and produce a high-grade metallic iron. An analysis of several samples showed pure metallic iron averaging from forty-nine to fifty-four per cent., with manganese ranging as high as two and one hundred and five thousandths per cent. In these analyses, silicious matter ranged at from six to eighteen per cent. A large boundary of valuable ore land lying just south of the Griffin Mines is owned by the Griffin heirs of this county. These lands contain both hematite and magnetic specular ore. Zinc ore has been developed near Roanoke City, but no active smelting has been done. In the Catawba Mountains are immense deposits of glass sand analyzing from ninety-eight to ninety-nine per cent. pure silica. A railroad has recently been constructed from these deposits to Salem, a distance of nine miles, and at the latter place a glass factory has been established and is now in operation. It is highly probable that this road will be extended in the near future to New Castle to connect with the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio. There are three large iron furnaces in Roanoke City, each with a capacity of about one hundred and twenty-five tons of pig iron daily. Agricultural Resources The soil of Roanoke County is above the average in fertility. Wheat is the principal cereal, the average yield being fifteen bushels to the acre. Corn and the grasses thrive. The valley lands are specially adapted to trucking and nearly all garden vegetables thrive and grow to perfection. Salads, parsnips, turnips, beets, melons, cantaloupes, celery, potatoes, and sweet potatoes thrive. Small fortunes are being made by Roanoke County truckers. They find a ready market at Roanoke, besides many thousands of tons of fresh vegetables are shipped from Roanoke into the coal fields over the Norfolk &amp; Western and Virginian railways. All farming in Roanoke County pays. The Bent Mountain section is specially adapted to the growth of the cabbage, which is noted for its size, flavor, and sweetness. Heads of cabbage weighing fifteen pounds are not uncommon on Bent Mountain. The Catawba Valley is specially suited for grazing and stock raising. Sheep raising can be made the most profitable of all stock raising in the county. Owing to the great productiveness of the Roanoke Valley and its enchanting mountain scenery, it has been very aptly styled one of the garden spots of Virginia. All the woods peculiar to central Virginia flourish in Roanoke. Oak, chestnut, pine, hickory, cedar, ash, poplar, locust, birch, and maple are the principal forest trees. Fruit Culture in Roanoke Roanoke County lies in the great fruit belt of Virginia, and the recent exhibits of fruit from the orchards of the county at the Great Roanoke Fair, the Lynchburg Fair, and the Virginia State Fair at Richmond is ample proof that the county is forging to the front as a fruit producing section more rapidly than any other portion of the State. Apples, pears, peaches, and plums of the finest varieties are grown, and they command the highest prices. Northern buyers bought entire crops last year on the trees, paying from $3.00 to $4.00 per barrel. In the Back Creek section of the county the Albemarle Pippin grows to perfection, and has attained a reputation which has extended to Europe. It is not uncommon for scores of apple growers to sell their entire crops at prices ranging from $3,000 to $10,000 per year. A number of large orchards have been planted in the last twenty years. Two notable orchards are the Woodrum Pippin Orchard on Bent Mountain and the Diamond Orchard near Salem. It is estimated that more than a million trees have been planted in Roanoke County in the past fifteen years. The principal apples grown are the Pippin, Winesap, Ben Davis, York Imperial, and Mammoth Black Twig. The cultivation of the grape succeeds well in this county. Indian Raid on Roanoke and Catawba In October, 1764, about fifty Delaware and Mingo Indians came from Ohio, following the Big Sandy River to its source, and across the divide to New River, thence on to the settlements in the Roanoke and Catawba valleys. The entire settlements were swept out of existence, every member of every family being either killed or captured. Among those who came under the vengeful guns and the fire of the savages were the Gunns, Carpenters, and Browns. They were either murdered or taken prisoners. All their cabins were burned, their valuables were stolen, and their stock driven off, after which most of the savages with their prisoners and plunder beat a hasty retreat. Small bands lingered behind, however, to render the work of destruction more complete. After passing New River their trail was discovered by three hunters named Swope, Pack, and Pitman. They were trapping on that stream, and on discovery of the trail, these men followed. On reaching a point, probably where Christiansburg now stands, they found that the trail had divided. One band went in one direction and one in another. One party came in the direction of the Roanoke settlements and the other headed for Jackson's River, near where Clifton Forge now stands. They History of Roanoke County determined to apprise the settlers of the Indians' intentions and accordingly set out—Swope and Pack for Roanoke and Pitman for Jackson's River. They were too late. Several days later the awful news of destruction reached Fort Dinwiddie on Jackson's River, and Captain Paul with a force of twenty men set out in pursuit. They followed the trail across the mountains and down New River to a point near Hawk's Nest. Captain Paul felt that further pursuit would be fruitless and started to return without having accomplished anything. On ascending New River they discovered a band of savages who had been on Catawba. It was in the night, and the Indians were encamped at a point a short distance above where Hinton, West Virginia, now stands. The Indians were sleeping, with the exception of those who were watching the prisoners. Captain Paul's force fired into them, killing three and wounding several others, one of whom drowned himself. The remainder of the Indians fled, leaving their dead and wounded and their prisoners behind. Captain Paul and his men rushed forward. A woman who was supposed to be a squaw was sitting quietly awaiting results. One of the invaders who was at the front rushed upon her with a tomahawk. Captain Paul, seeing her danger, threw himself between the assailant and his victim. He received the blow of the tomahawk upon his arm, and at the same time exclaimed, "It is a shame to hurt a woman, even a squaw." The woman at once recognized the voice of Captain Paul and called him by name. Prior to her marriage she had lived in the family of Captain Paul's father-in-law. Her name was Mrs. Catherine Gunn. She had been captured by the Indians on Catawba, where her husband and two children had been killed by the Indians. Hardesty's Historical Encyclopedia in speaking of the incident says: "When questioned why she had not cried out or otherwise made known that she was a white prisoner, she replied, `I had as soon be killed as not; my husband is murdered, my children are slain, and my parents are dead. I have not a relative in America; everything dear to me is gone; I have no hopes, no wishes, no fears. I would not have arisen to my feet to save my life.' " "These heartbroken utterances of Mrs. Gunn remind one forcibly of the closing sentences of the celebrated speech of Logan, the Indian chief, uttered ten years afterward, `There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heels to save his life.' His family had met a similar fate at the hands of the white man. Mrs. Gunn with the other two prisoners were carried back to Fort Dinwiddie." The Indians who escaped carried, among others, three boys as prisoners. Two were named Brown and one Carpenter, the latter afterwards Dr. Carpenter, of Nicholas County, West Virginia. He spent fifteen years in captivity. One of the Brown boys, later Colonel Samuel Brown, of Greenbrier, came back in 1769. The other brother never returned. He married an Indian girl and lived on the present site of Brownstown, Michigan, the town being named after him. He became an American soldier and was actively engaged in the war of 1812. He died in 1815. Such a chapter from the early history of the territory from which Roanoke County was formed, and such was one of the acts in the great drama of border warfare, the shock of which our ancestors withstood for more than a hundred years, all for the purpose of bequeathing a fair inheritance to their posterity. Escape of the Bryans Among the very earliest settlers in the Roanoke Valley was the Bryan family. As early as 1748, William Bryan conveyed to James Bryan, his son, a part of the Dr. Johnston or Lake Spring farm, near Salem. The Bryans came from the north of Ireland. They came to Roanoke from Pennsylvania about the year 1746. William Bryan settled near Lake Spring and David near the present city of Roanoke, on land afterwards owned by Captain R. B. Moorman, in the northwestern part of the city. David Bryan with his family afterwards moved to North Carolina. When the two brothers, William and David Bryan, came to this section, the Indians often visited the valley. The Bryans were on very friendly terms with them, and by kind treatment gained their friendship and confidence. One chief was a frequent visitor at the house of William Bryan, and on one occasion warned him, under oath of secrecy, of a contemplated massacre of the whites, telling him that "before the leaves on the trees are as big as squirrels' ears, every paleface in this country will be destroyed." This was probably the time of the incursion on the settlements of Catawba and Jackson's River as narrated above. When the massacre commenced, William Bryan and his family embarked in their canoes and went down the Roanoke River. They returned to Pennsylvania, where they remained for two years. On their return to the Roanoke Valley they found their cabin burned, their stock gone, with nothing left alive to meet them but a cat, which came out from the ruins, and an old rooster that, on their approach, flew up on a pile of rocks and crowed. This is described as being "but a step from the sublime to the ridiculous, and this little incident indicates the thin veil between the tragic and the grotesque. History of Roanoke Country No picture can be so dark but, held in certain lights, it will present some cheerful, if not humorous, aspects." The Exploits of William Carvin William Carvin, who was granted a tract of one hundred and fifty acres of land on Carvin's Creek on July 25th, 1746, was a noted Indian fighter, if there be anything in the traditions which have been handed down concerning his exploits. It is told that he was an expert marksman, shooting the wily savages with unerring aim. Once, when pursued by two Indians with loaded rifles, he took refuge behind a huge apple tree. In order to save himself he adopted a ruse which worked most successfully. He placed his hat on the ramrod of his gun, extending it past the tree in full sight of the savages, when one of them fired at the hat, striking it. Carvin immediately shot the other Indian, whose gun was loaded, and reloading his own weapon as rapidly as possible, shot the Indian who had fired at the hat, thus despatching both his enemies and escaping unhurt. The apple tree stood near the site of Hollins College, and in 1820 the land on which it stood was purchased by the father of Frederick Johnston, Roanoke County's second Clerk. The tree was still standing, but soon afterwards died. Many walking canes were made from the wood of the old tree and sold at high prices as relics. At another time Carvin was hotly pursued by savages, and in his flight reached the top of a tall cliff overhanging the falls of Carvin's Creek. He could not retrace his steps or turn to the right or left, for inevitable capture and possibly the worst tortures and death would have resulted. His only chance of escape was to plunge into the foaming pool at the foot of the falls. He made the daring leap in safety, but no savage foe had the hardihood to follow. Thus he escaped. The experiences of Carvin may have been similar in nature to those of many other hardy pioneers, but they have never been recorded, and in the corroding course of time the traditions have been lost or forgotten. Military History of the County Roanoke County's military history is full of interest, and there has never been a call to duty which has not been fully and completely answered by the county's yeomanry. Her young men have ever been ready to rally to the support of their country in the hour of peril. In the War of the Revolution, the men from the Valley of Virginia were among the very best troops in the Continental Army. At that period, Roanoke was embraced in the county of Botetourt. Colonel George Skillern was Commander of Troops for Botetourt County, and she furnished her full quota of troops. In 1781, a last call was made on Colonel Skillern, through Thomas Jefferson, then Governor of Virginia, for men to fight. Lord Cornwallis was then invading Virginia soil. That the section of Virginia now comprised within the boundary lines of Roanoke County furnished some of the best and bravest of the Revolutionary heroes is fully attested in the history of two notable persons, one being General Andrew Lewis and the other Colonel William Fleming. The military exploits of these two men, together with a note of each of their lives, may very properly be recorded in this section of this work. John Lewis, the father of General Andrew Lewis, was the pioneer settler of the upper Valley of Virginia and the founder of the town of Staunton. He was born in the year 1678, in County Donegal, Province of Ulster, Ireland. He was the first white settler in Augusta County, the date of his coming being 1732. He furnished five sons to fight the battles of the new country; namely, Samuel, Thomas, Andrew, and William, born in Ireland, and Charles, the child of his old age, born shortly after the arrival of the family in America, and the only one to fall in fighting the battles of the colonists, being killed at Point Pleasant. It is not within our province to give a detailed history of the Lewis family. General Andrew Lewis who lived near where Salem now stands, was so closely identified with affairs here, and members of his own family played so prominent a part in the early development of the Roanoke Valley that any mention of the Lewises may be regarded as forming an important part of the county's history. It is not known when General Lewis located in Botetourt County. In 1767 he acquired by patent six hundred and twenty-five acres of land on a portion of which the town of Salem is located. He built a home on an eminence just east of where Salem stands, and where in 1774, he was visited by Lord Dunmore, Provincial Governor of Virginia. When Botetourt County was organized in 1769, he was made presiding justice of the County Court. "Richfield" was the name of General Lewis's home, and in the course of time it became known as "Dropmore." General Lewis represented Botetourt County in the House of Burgesses for a number of years. He was an unflinching advocate of the rights of the colonies, and was a member of the Convention of 1775. Andrew Lewis held the rank of major in Washington's regiment at the surrender of Fort Necessity, July 4th, 1754, when, by articles of capitulation, the garrison was to return without molestation to the inhabited districts. Major Lewis served with History of Roanoke County distinction in the campaign of 1755, and his command displayed great courage at Braddock's defeat, June 10th of that year. The next year he led the "Sandy Creek" expedition against the Shawnees on the Ohio River. At the defeat of Major Grant of the royal army at Fort Duquesne, both he and Major Lewis were captured by the French. Major Grant, while a prisoner, addressed a letter to General Forbes, attributing their defeat and capture to Lewis. The French officers, having censored the letter and knowing the imputation to be false, handed it to Lewis, who at once challenged Grant. He refused to fight, when Lewis spat in his face and left him to reflect over his baseness. Throughout the French and Indian wars, which ended in 1763, Lewis sustained the highest reputation for bravery and military capacity. Battle of Point Pleasant In 1764, a few months after the "Treaty of Paris" had ended the French and Indian wars, hostilities on the part of the Indians broke out on the western frontier of Virginia. Major Lewis was at once made a Brigadier General, and in September of that year, with a force of one thousand one hundred brave colonists, set out for Camp Union (now Lewisburg, West Virginia), on his march to Point Pleasant, at the junction of the Ohio and Great Kanawha rivers. It was planned that he should meet Lord Dunmore, then Governor of Virginia, who was in command of a larger force, but the latter failed to appear. Dunmore was strongly suspected of treachery. At Point Pleasant the most formidable army of Indians ever gathered in America had assembled. This army comprised the flower of the confederated tribes of the Delawares, Mingoes, Cayugas, Iowas, Wyandottes, and Shawnees, under the leadership of the great Shawnee chief, Cornstalk, one of the most renowned Indian warriors of history. It was believed to be impossible for General Lewis with his small force to successfully contend with this powerful army. Dunmore's failure to keep his appointment did not, however, deter the brave defenders of the Virginia frontier in their efforts to subdue the wily savages from further invasion of the settlements and the slaughter of the innocents. The battle commenced at sunrise on October 10th and continued throughout the day. It was a desperate conflict and at times it seemed that all was lost. Unexampled bravery was displayed on both sides. Cornstalk, with a courage calm and undismayed, led on his army of savage foes, and at one time when an Indian warrior showed a want of courage he slew him with his tomahawk. During the day and as the battle raged he could be heard calling and encouraging his warriors, exclaiming in his native tongue, "Be strong! Be strong!" At last, after the battle had raged all day, General Lewis succeeded in turning the tide in favor of the Virginians. The conflict, while bloody, resulted in glorious victory, and during the night the Indians fled across the Ohio River, never again to invade the soil of Virginia, thus leaving our frontiers free from any hostile Indian incursion, anything like formidable in character. A treaty of peace was soon concluded, the far-reaching effects of which, coupled with the great victory achieved by General Lewis, had a most pronounced effect on the future of America. It was one of the initiatory steps which led to our national independence. Dr. Samuel L. Campbell, of Rockbridge County, in writing of the battle of Point Pleasant, said: "To form a just estimate of the importance of this campaign it would be necessary to consider the character of the Indians, their propensity for war, the great combined strength they possessed in 1774, the indications which they had manifested of hostile intentions, the efforts made by British traders to urge them on to war, the defenseless state of the frontier, the distracted condition of the provinces in apprehension of war with Great Britain; all these things being duly considered must unquestionably lead to the conclusion that the battle of Point Pleasant, taken in connection with the treaty which immediately followed, constituted the first act in the great drama of the Revolution; that it had an important bearing in all subsequent acts of that tragedy; that it immediately and materially influenced the destinies of our country, and more recently the destinies of many other countries, perhaps of the whole world." Revolutionary Service of Lewis At the beginning of the Revolution in 1775, General Lewis was appointed colonel of a regiment in the Continental Army, and soon afterwards was made Brigadier General. He drove Lord Dunmore from Gwynn's Island, and beside having the distinction of expelling from Virginia soil her last Indian foe, he also banished the last of the Royal Governors. He enjoyed the confidence and esteem of Washington; and Campbell, a Virginia historian, in writing of this says: "At the commencement of the Revolutionary War, Washington considered him the foremost military man in America, and the one most worthy of the post of Commander in Chief of the American Army." Washington, after his appointment as Commander of the Continental Army, recommended to Congress that Lewis be made a Major General, but the recommendation was slighted by that body. Lewis offered his resignation, which was accepted by Congress, April 15th, 1777. Through Washington's History of Roanoke County solicitation he was restored to his command and stationed at Williamsburg, Virginia, and his military services were employed in defending the country bordering on the Chesapeake Bay. In September, 1781, he was seized with fever, superinduced by the malaria of the eastern swamps, and started for his home, "Richfield." On reaching the home of Captain Talbot, near the present station of Montvale, in Bedford County, he grew rapidly worse, and died a few days afterwards. Dr. William Fleming, and his two sons, Thomas and Andrew Lewis, were with him when the end came. The remains were taken to his home near the present site of Salem, and buried beside his youngest son, Charles, who had died several years before. The grave was on an eminence overlooking the valley for miles around. The fence surrounding it had disappeared many years ago, and the exact spot where rested the remains of this great warrior might have been lost but for the thoughtful care of Frederick Johnston, of Salem. Colonel Elijah McClanahan, who was present at the burial, pointed out the grave to him. Colonel McClanahan was an old man then. Mr. Johnston took the trouble to mark the grave with boulder stones, on one of which he painted the name of General Lewis, and on the other his initials. One hundred and sixteen years had passed away when it was determined by the Daughters of the American Revolution that a monument should be erected to the memory of the "Hero of Point Pleasant." It was also decided to remove the remains to East Hill Cemetery, Salem, and erect the memorial there. Some difficulty was experienced in locating the grave. Frederick Johnston, who once knew, had been dead many years. In the meantime, William McCauley had pointed out from the town of Salem the hill where Mr. Johnston had marked the stones with paint to Honorable Lucian H. Cocke, of Roanoke. Although a decision had been reached that the remains should be removed, no one then living knew the exact location of the grave. With the boulder marked "A. L." as the only guide, and hundreds of like boulders on the hill, it seemed questionable as to whether the grave could be found. Mr. Cocke, accompanied by his wife and two other representatives of the Daughters of the Revolution, instituted a search, and after considerable time had been spent, Mr. Cocke, while resting beside a tree, noticed a peculiar looking stone some distance away. Upon examination it proved to be the boulder with the paint marks put there by Frederick Johnston more than fifty years ago. Accordingly, on April 2d, 1897, the neglected grave was opened by John M. Oakey &amp; Son, undertakers. The bones were found in a perfect state of preservation, military buttons and coffin tacks with the initials, "A. L." embedded in the heads were also found, while beside them the bones of his young son, Charles, were found. His remains with those of the boy were reinterred in East Hill Cemetery on April 5th at noon, in the presence of a committee of ladies of the chapter, appropriate exercises being conducted by the Rev. J. B. Taylor. A piece of the walnut coffin in which General Lewis was buried was taken from the grave. It was well preserved and is now in the hands of a representative of the Lewis family. Colonel William Fleming It is not generally known that the remains of Colonel William Fleming, a Revolutionary hero, and a great Indian fighter, lay buried a short distance to the northeast of the city of Roanoke. He came to Virginia in 1755, landing at Norfolk. In Scotland he had studied medicine and surgery, but not being fond of the practice, entered the army as an ensign in the First Virginia Regiment of the Colonial service. He was a lieutenant in the "Sandy Creek" expedition in 1756, and was also surgeon of the expedition. He continued in the service for eight years and was at the taking of Fort Duquesne. In 1763 he married Nancy Christian, daughter of Israel Christian, and in 1770 purchased "Bellmont," a farm near the present site of Roanoke, now partly owned by Frank Read. The original farm contained about two thousand five hundred acres. Colonel Fleming was one of the county justices when the Botetourt County Court was organized February 13th, 1770. In the battle of Point Pleasant, Colonel Fleming commanded the Botetourt companies under Captains Matthew Arbuckle, John Murray, John Lewis, James Robertson, Robert McClanahan, James Ward, and John Stuart. He was wounded in this battle whilst leading a charge on the Indians, in the beginning of the engagement, receiving two bullets in the arm and one in the lungs. Colonel Charles Lewis and Colonel John Field both being killed, the command devolved on Colonel Fleming, who continued in the field, and the exertion of giving commands forced the lungs through the wound. When relieved from the command his condition was considered hopeless, and owing to the scarcity of surgical aid, nothing was done for him. A servant who had often attended surgical operations with him dressed the wounded colonel's injuries, and he finally recovered. The bullet in his breast was never extracted and not only caused great suffering through his life, but was at last the cause of his death. In 1781 he attended General Lewis, being present at his death. He was a member of the Council of Virginia under Thomas Jefferson, and was in the State Senate for many years. History of Roanoke County He died in August, 1795, aged sixty-six years. He was born in Jedburgh, Scotland, February 18th, 1729. His grave and that of his wife are in the old Bellmont burial ground on the banks of Tinker Creek in Roanoke County. First Military Organization We find the military spirit pervading the people of Roanoke soon after the organization of the county. McCauley in his history says: "In the early `forties' Abraham Hupp, who had recently entered on his useful and honorable career in Salem as an intelligent mechanic and public spirited citizen, organized a military company, of which he became the captain." The company was denominated the "Yellow Jackets," the name indicating the color of the uniform worn as well as the belligerent propensities of the organization. A few years later the company disbanded, but was soon reorganized under the name of the "Salem Light Infantry Grays," with Captain Hupp as commander. After some years of service in drilling, going on dress parade and taking active part in Fourth of July celebrations, and forming an interesting adjunct to the annual display of militiamen from every section of the county, the "Salem Light Infantry Grays" disbanded. A little more than two decades after the formation of Roanoke County, the country was startled by the John Brown Raid, which occurred in 1859. This was but the beginning of the storm which was to break in a few months and was destined to shake the land from its center to its circumference. Captain Hupp, thoroughly imbued with the military spirit, for the third time formed a company, and on January 30th, 1860, he organized the "Salem Flying Artillery Company." They organized for action, and the company was destined to act its part in a more thrilling arena than that of the parade ground or of the annual Fourth of July celebration or militia muster. The boys who answered the call of country were destined to experience the grim realities of bloody war. Scarcely twelve months rolled around before the quiet streets of Salem wore an ominous aspect, and the long expected sound of the call to battle was heard. The first dread alarm of the Civil War between the states had been sent out. The Salem Flying Artillery answered at once, and only a few days elapsed before the brave Roanokers marched to the front, there to do and die in the cause of their State and the South. The company continued in service until the wasted legions of General Lee laid down their arms at Appomattox four years later. Captain Hupp was disabled by disease after nearly two years of arduous service and was succeeded in command by Captain Charles B. Griffin, of Salem, who served until the close of the war. The Salem Flying Artillery claimed the honor of having fired the last shot in the battle that ended the fearful struggle which had cost so much, and sacrificed so many lives. When the call to arms was heard, other volunteer companies were formed in Roanoke County in rapid succession. The "Roanoke Grays," an infantry company commanded by Captain Madison P. Deyerle, was organized in March, 1861, and entered the Confederate service in April, 1861. The "Dixie Grays," infantry, was organized the following June, and was mustered into service on July 1st, 1861, and during the same month another infantry company, the "Roanoke Guards," was organized and entered the Confederate service shortly afterwards. McCauley, in his "History of Roanoke County," says: "The soldiers composing these several companies were the flower of the young men of the county, among the best and bravest of the land. From the college halls, the work shop, the farm, the happy homes, they went to the tented field at their country's call, many of them never to return. The companies to which they belonged participated in many of the battles of the Army of Northern Virginia and of the Western Army. Decimated by death on the battlefield, in prisons and hospitals, there was but a small remnant left at the close of the war. The survivors, for the most part, bear on their persons the marks of the fiery ordeal through which they passed, attesting their valor and devotion to duty." Salem Flying Artillery This company was mustered into the Confederate service at Lynchburg, Virginia, May 16th, 1851, and served as Company A, Ninth Regiment, Virginia Volunteers, until the evacuation of Norfolk in May, 1862, and was afterwards designated as "Hupp's Battery, First Regiment, Virginia Artillery, and subsequently as Griffin's Battery, Hardaway's Battery, and Virginia Artillery, serving under the last name until it surrendered with Lee's army at Appomattox Courthouse on April 9th, 1865, having participated in the following battles: Williamsport, Maryland, September 20th, 1862; Fredericksburg, Virginia, December 12-13th, 1862; Chancellorsville, May 2d, 1863; Gettysburg, July 3d, 1863; Spottsylvania Courthouse, May 18th, 1864; Cold Harbor, June 1st, 1864; Cold Harbor, June 7th, 1864; Fort Gilmore, September 29th, 1864. The Salem Flying Artillery, together with the Richmond Howitzers and Rockbridge Battery, forming the First Virginia Artillery Battalion, claim the History of Roanoke County distinction of having fired the first and last shots of the Army of Northern Virginia. The following is an extract from General D. H. Hill's magazine, "The Land We Love," under date of July, 1869: "The first engagement which partook of the nature of a battle was the battle of Bethel. In this action the regiment was represented by the Richmond Howitzers, and this being the first action in which artillery was used, they fired the first shot after war had been formally declared. "The battery was reorganized in the spring of 1862. As thus organized, it participated in every prominent battle fought by the Army of Northern Virginia. On the retreat from Richmond it was one of the few regiments of battalions of any branch of the service which preserved its organization intact to the fatal field of Appomattox. "On the ever memorable ninth of April, 1865, the Salem Flying Artillery (Company A), commanded by Captain Charles B. Griffin, was placed in position on the extreme left. After having made several ineffectual attempts to obtain possession of the road at the courthouse, the enemy massed a heavy line preparatory to charging the Salem battery, which held the position commanding the town. He charged boldly on with pistol shot, when an order from General Gordon was given to cease firing, and at the same time one of his aides bore a white flag to the advancing column. The whole army had surrendered. The hoarse sound of the cannon had died away in every part of the line except this, the extreme left, which was soon after silenced, and with it the last gun of the Army of Northern Virginia. "General Gordon, in his farewell address to his corps, paid a compliment to this battalion for its conduct during the war, and adverted to the fact that it had fired the first and last shot in the Army of Northern Virginia." The officers of the Salem Flying Artillery were as follows: Abraham Hupp, Captain; Charles B. Griffin, Captain; David C. Shanks, First Lieutenant; Henry E. Blair, First Lieutenant; Warren L.

At the close of hostilities, about thirty men remained out of a total of one hundred and thirty. At Chickamauga the company captured the colors of a Michigan regiment, the Colonel commanding the latter surrendering his sword to the Captain of the Roanoke Guards. At Franklin, Tennessee, while on picket duty, the company held the lines in the face of the enemy, which outnumbered them four or five to one, killing nearly as many Federals as there were men in its own ranks. Colonel R. C. Trigg, commanding the brigade, complimented the company for bravery, as the Colonel commanding had done at Chickamauga. After the battle of Franklin, Tennessee, all of the company who had not been killed or were off on sick leave or furlough, or in hospitals, joined the army under General Joseph E.

History of Roanoke County Jeff Davis Rifles About the year 1890, the "Jeff Davis Rifles," an infantry volunteer company, was organized in Salem with Dr. Clarence B. Strouse, Captain. On January 1st, 1892, Judge Wingfield Griffin was elected Captain to succeed Captain Strouse. This company was among the first of the Virginia companies to volunteer for service in the Spanish-American War, and was mustered into the service of the United States at Camp Lee in Richmond, May 11th, 1898, and became Company H, Second Virginia Regiment, United States Volunteers. The company numbered one hundred and twenty-two, of which twenty-two were from Salem and two from Roanoke County. The remainder came from almost every section of Virginia, but mostly from the Southwest. The company lost two members by death, Frank M. Key, of Montgomery, Virginia, and Samuel Richardson, of Burks Garden, Virginia. Both men died from typhoid fever, the former, August 21st, 1898, and the latter on September 6th, 1898. Both were buried in Jacksonville, Florida, where they died. The officers of the "Jeff Davis Rifles" were as follows: Wingfield Griffin, Captain, Salem, Virginia; Thomas A. Johnson, First Lieutenant, Salem, Virginia; Lewis W. Langhorne, Second Lieutenant, Salem, Virginia; Erskine L. White, First Sergeant, Salem, Virginia; Thomas T.

Neuman, East Radford, Corporals; Frank Lester and James H. Morris, of Salem, Musicians; John Garst, Salem, Artificer; Estelle A. Shell, East Radford, Wagoner. The company was mustered out of the service of the United States at Jacksonville, Florida, on December 16th, 1898. Military Operations in Roanoke County But few military operations or movements of note occurred within the limits of Roanoke County, which was possibly due to its geographical position. Federal soldiers first visited the county on December 16th, 1862, when a cavalry force of one thousand five hundred men, under General Averill, came to Salem. He reached Hanging Rock about eight o'clock in the morning and left a force of five hundred men to guard the road leading to Big Lick. On entering Salem he fired several buildings and captured about fifty prisoners, when he returned to Hanging Rock. That night his army camped in Mason's Cove, and early the following morning moved west and passed over the mountains into West Virginia. In June, 1864, General Hunter, after spending several days in Buchanan and burning the town, went on to Lynchburg with a force of twenty thousand men, and was defeated by General Early. Forced to retreat hastily, he came back through Roanoke County, passing out by Hanging Rock, reaching that point on June 21st, and began going through the gap about seven o'clock in the morning. Two hours later General McCausland, with a small force, reached the scene, and opened fire on the lines from the east side of Mason's Creek. This was continued for an hour or more, when one of Hunter's divisions crossed the stream about a mile below, and, flanking him, compelled him to retreat by way of Green Ridge in the direction of Botetourt Springs, carrying with him about forty prisoners and forty horses. Skirmishing and sharp shooting were kept up throughout the day. The Federal loss was seven killed and forty wounded. The dead were left on the field and afterwards buried by the Confederates. Later they were removed to the National Cemetery in Staunton, Virginia. The wounded were borne away by the fugitive army. Two of General McCausland's men, Whitworth, of Montgomery County, and Kale, of Monroe County, West Virginia, were killed and both buried on the lands of Benjamin Brubaker. Quite a number of Confederates were wounded, but all recovered. At four o'clock in the afternoon, Hunter's rear guard passed through the gap, just an hour before General Early's advance guard arrived at that point. Had the two armies met, Roanoke County would have been the scene of one of the bloodiest conflicts of the war. Early realized that it would be futile to attempt further pursuit, as the enemy was in possession of the mountain passes. The residence of John Garst was burned by a detachment of Hunter's army, after having destroyed all his personal property. When in the vicinity of Catawba, General Hunter, fearing capture, destroyed all his trains, artillery, etc. There are many old people residing in Roanoke County to-day who distinctly remember the detonations when he blew up his caissons. General Hunter then made his way to the Ohio River at Point Pleasant. The third Federal force to enter the county was immediately after the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox. A detachment of General Stoneman's brigade of Michigan Cavalry burned the depot at Christiansburg on April 9th, the day of Lee's surrender, and then started eastward, burning depots History of Roanoke County and tearing up the railroad a distance of forty miles, ending at Bonsack Depot. A number of the participants in this light conflict are still living in Roanoke and vicinity, notably among them being William A. Byrd, T. B. Cannaday, R. H. Fishburne, Isaac Williams, and William A. Griffith. Roanoke County in 1840 The following is taken from Howe's "Virginia, its History and Antiquities": "Roanoke was formed from Botetourt in 1838. The name is probably derived from the Indian word Roenoke, or Rawrenoke, signifying the Indian shell money. It is a small county with a mean length of about twenty, and mean width of eighteen miles. The Blue Ridge forms its eastern boundary; the western parts are mountainous. Much of the soil of the county, particularly on the Roanoke River in the vicinity of Big Lick, is of almost unequalled fertility, and productive in hemp, wheat, and tobacco. Population in 1840, whites, three thousand eight hundred and forty-three; slaves, one thousand five hundred and fifty-three; free colored, one hundred and one; total, five thousand four hundred and ninety-seven. "Salem, the county seat, is in the Valley of Virginia, on the west bank of Roanoke River, one hundred and seventy-eight miles westerly from Richmond, twenty-five miles northeast of Christiansburg, and twenty-three miles from Fincastle. The navigation of the Roanoke from Weldon, North Carolina, to this place, two hundred and forty-four miles, is completed by canals, sluices, etc. Salem is a neat village and contains six stores, one Presbyterian, one Baptist, and one Methodist church, and a population of about four hundred and fifty. Big Lick, seven miles east of Salem on the main stage road, contains a Baptist church and a few dwellings. Burlington contains a few dwellings. "The Botetourt Springs, in the northern part of the county, twelve miles from Fincastle, are quite popular, and the improvements are sufficient to accommodate a large number of visitors. The spring contains sulphur, magnesia, carbonic acid gas, etc." Officers of Roanoke County Following is a list of the officers who have served in various capacities since the formation of the county in 1838, together with State Senators and members of the House of Representatives: State Senators John T.

Railroads in Roanoke County The first railroad that entered Roanoke County was the Virginia &amp; Tennessee, extending from History of Roanoke County—Fort Lewis Lynchburg to Bristol, a distance of two hundred and four and one-fourth miles. The road was chartered in 1848, and operations began the next year in Lynchburg. In 1852 trains were running to Little Otter Bridge, in Bedford County, a distance of twenty-two miles. The construction was completed through Roanoke and Montgomery counties in 1854-5, and in 1856 was completed to Bristol. During the Civil War, the road was cut and torn up in many places by Federal forces under Generals Hunter, Averill, and Stoneman. In 1866, the Virginia &amp; Tennessee Railroad consolidated with the Southside and Norfolk &amp; Petersburg railroads, and became a part of the system known as the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio, with General William Mahone as President, and as such it remained until 1881, when the consolidation was dissolved and it became the Norfolk &amp; Western, reaching from Norfolk to Bristol. In 1882, the Shenandoah Valley Railroad was built from Hagerstown to Roanoke, connecting with the Norfolk &amp; Western. This was operated but a short time when it was purchased by the latter company, and has since been operated as the Shenandoah Valley Division of the Norfolk &amp; Western. It was with the building of this road that Roanoke City, then known as Big Lick, began to grow. In 1893 the Roanoke &amp; Southern Railway was constructed from Roanoke to Winston-Salem in North Carolina. This new road was operated but a few months before the Norfolk &amp; Western realized its importance as a southern outlet and acquired it by purchase, and it has since been operated as the Winston-Salem Division of the Norfolk &amp; Western. Something more than a year ago, a private company began the construction of a short line of railway from Salem to Catawba. It was known as the Catawba Valley Railway Company. Before the work was completed it was taken over and finished by the Norfolk &amp; Western and is now being operated. The line is seven miles long, and will be utilized mainly for the shipping of the immense deposits of glass sand found in the Catawba Mountains. In 1907-8 the Virginian Railway, formerly known as the Tidewater, was built through Roanoke County from east to west, and parallels the Norfolk &amp; Western for twenty miles, deflecting from the latter road a short distance this side of Elliston, in Montgomery County. At Roanoke the Virginian leaves the Norfolk &amp; Western and follows the course of the Roanoke River to the Bedford County line. This road extends from Sewell's Point, near Norfolk, to Deepwater, West Virginia, a distance of four hundred and forty-six miles, and is destined to become one of the greatest coal carrying roads in the United States. It represents the work and genius of a single man, the late Henry H. Rogers, of New York, who financed and built the road. He lived to see his road bed completed and trains running through from the Atlantic Seaboard to Deepwater, and he made one trip over the entire road, but died within a few weeks after its completion. The road was constructed with an eye single to heavy freight hauling. Mountains were tunnelled and valleys filled or bridged with high trestles, and in this way all grades were reduced to a minimum. A movement is on foot to construct a new railroad from Roanoke to Mount Airy, North Carolina, a distance of eighty-three miles, the company promoting the projected road being known as the Roanoke, Mount Airy &amp; Southern Railway Company. Many years ago the Valley Railroad was graded from Lexington to Salem, but before any rails were laid work was suspended. This property afterwards reverted to the Baltimore &amp; Ohio, and now there is a strong probability that this road may be completed in the near future, with Roanoke City as the terminal point. Population of Roanoke County Roanoke County, 1910, 19,623; 1900, 15,837. Big Lick District, including Vinton Town, 1910, 6,420; 1900, 3,974. Vinton Town, 1910, 1,928; 1900, 1,438.

The combined population of Roanoke County and Roanoke City is 54,457. HISTORY OF FORT LEWIS Any definite history bearing on the building of Fort Lewis or the date of its construction is very meager. Indian depredations on the frontier of Augusta were frequent and the greatest caution was necessary on the part of the settlers, as well as the civil and military authorities. Governor Dinwiddie, though unpopular, was untiring in his efforts to protect the frontier. In 1755 civilization had not extended far beyond the present confines of Roanoke County. It is almost certain that Fort Lewis had been built and occupied as a point of defense during the previous year. The name is not mentioned in the proceedings of the "Council of War" called by Governor Dinwiddie in July, 1756, which had for its object the establishment of forts to protect our frontiers. A fort to be built at Captain Vause's, on the South Fork of Roanoke River near History of Roanoke County—Fort Lewis the present site of Shawsville, is the farthest west of the entire chain of fourteen forts ordered by the "Council of War." On September 11th, 1754, Governor Dinwiddie wrote to Washington: "Therefore, I now order you to give a detachment of forty or fifty men to Captain Lewis (afterwards General Andrew Lewis). With them he is to march immediately to Augusta County in order to protect our frontier from the incursion of small parties of Indians, and, I suppose, some French. Order him to march immediately and to apply to Colonel Patton, the County Lieutenant, who will direct him to proceed that he may be most useful." A letter was addressed to Colonel Andrew Lewis the same day, setting forth fully the desires of Governor Dinwiddie, in which he stated, "I now desire you to be as expeditious as possible in getting to Augusta, as I have several letters of some parties of Indians, etc., robbing and plundering our people. I wish you health and success in the command you are ordered on, and I remain, Sir, your friend, etc." Wardell's "Annals of Augusta," in referring to this, says: "On the sixth of October, 1754, Captain Lewis was on his march to protect the frontier. He went somewhere west or south of Staunton, but to what point we cannot ascertain, and built a stockade fort there to check Indian raids—perhaps it was in the Greenbrier country, or it may have been Fort Lewis, near the site of the present town of Salem, in Roanoke County." Inasmuch as the record shows that the chain of forts was not established until nearly two years later by the "Council of War," and in that chain is not mentioned the name of Fort Lewis, and as the orders show that Captain Lewis was to apply to Colonel Patton, County Lieutenant, who resided at Pattonsburg, on the north side of the James River at Buchanan, "for further directions," and the further facts that important land grants were given him in the Roanoke Valley contiguous to, and about the site of old Fort Lewis, and his final settlement nearby, all lead up to the well established opinion that it was here that he built the stockade fort mentioned. Even the name "Fort Lewis" is suggestive of the fact that it was at this point he took his stand in the protection of the frontier. The "Fort Lewis" Home The historical "Fort Lewis" home, now the property of Frank Burwell Gordon, is one of the few colonial homes of this section of Virginia which has connected with it a history worthy of note. In August, 1910, Mr. Gordon, after spending fifteen years in South America and taking a world cruise, purchased about one hundred acres of the rich, fertile lands comprised in the original "Fort Lewis" tract, including the old "Fort Lewis" home, which he has since completely remodelled, and of which a halftone engraving accompanies this article. Mr. Gordon has spent a small fortune in modernizing this old historic homestead. The architectural design is of pure colonial style, presenting an elegance surpassed by few, if any, of the historic homes of the Old Dominion. The architectural designs were furnished by George F. Barber &amp; Company, of Knoxville, Tennessee. The broad avenue leading to the mansion, its towering shade trees, and the massive columns, placed by modern mechanical genius, all lend an enchantment particularly applicable to the great landed estates of Virginia in colonial times. Situated on an eminence about midway between the Norfolk &amp; Western, which is paralleled by the Virginian Railway, on the one side, and the "rock" road following the line of the "Great Trail" on the other, and in plain view for several miles up and down the Roanoke Valley, as colonialized and modernized by the present owner, it has become a landmark for travelers either by rail or highway. "Fort Lewis" of to-day is not surpassed in elegance and appointment by any home in Southwest Virginia. From foundation to dome material of lasting quality has been employed. The roof is of the latest and most approved tiling. The house is lighted by electricity, furnished by an exclusive generating plant; heated from cellar to dome by one of the most modern hot water plants ever installed in this section of Virginia; a pneumatic system of water supply with hot and cold water in all parts of the house; with the entire lower floor practically remodelled into an immense hall with richly hanging drapery separating parlor and library from the reception hall, and the floors covered with the softest carpets; a large central stairway leading to the rooms above; the interior finish being of the richest of hardwoods, and the best art of the paper makers and decorators, all lend an air of elegance to the place, of which no home in this county or section can boast. The exterior arrangements of this modern home have been most carefully attended. There is a model garage, modern in all its appointments. Water has been piped to all parts of the place. The stables are the most modern in the country and are well stocked with blooded horses. History of "Fort Lewis" Home The original survey on which "Fort Lewis" is situated comprised two thousand two hundred acres History of Roanoke County—Fort Lewis FORT LEWIS—HOME OF F. B. GORDON of land, to which was subsequently added four hundred and six acres. Under date of April 5th, 1748, George II, in the twenty-first year of his reign, through Sir William Gooch, Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, granted to James Campbell, in consideration of thirty shillings, two hundred and sixty-seven acres of land, lying and being in the county of Augusta on the west side of Roanoke River. With the patent, all mineral rights were conveyed together with the privileges of hunting, hawking, fishing, fowling, and all other profit commodities and other hereditaments whatsoever. James Campbell was to pay for every fifty acres included one shilling yearly rents, "to be paid upon the feast of Saint Michael, the Archangel." He was also to improve and cultivate three acres for every fifty included in the tract. Of this great tract George III, on February 14th, 1761, through Francis Fauquier, Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, granted to Alexander Boyd ninety-eight acres of land on the waters of Roanoke for ten shillings. On August 14th, 1771, Andrew Boyd, administrator for Alexander Boyd, conveyed to Alexander Bain, one thousand two hundred acres, more or less, indicating that Alexander Boyd, either by grant or purchase had become seized and possessed of a large boundary. This same land was mortgaged for £1,142, 6s, 11d, bearing interest from November 27th, 1764. In 1785, Patrick Henry, then Governor of Virginia, for the sum of £6, 10s, paid by Alexander Bain into the treasury, granted by the said Commonwealth unto David Ross, assignee of Alexander Bain, two thousand two hundred acres by survey dated January 11th, 1773, lying and being in the county of Botetourt on both sides of Roanoke River. Four hundred acres thereof was granted to James Campbell by letters patent bearing date February 12th, 1742. One hundred acres, another part thereof, was granted to Colonel James Patton by letters patent, and two hundred and sixty-seven acres (mentioned above) to James Campbell. This grant also included two patents of ninety-eight and thirty acres, respectively, granted to Alexander Boyd under date of February 14th, 1761, and which had reverted to Alexander Bain; two hundred and forty-eight acres which had been made to Alexander Boyd, and returned by him, and afterwards assigned to Alexander Bain, together with a residue of one thousand and fifty-seven acres never before granted, and which several said tracts completed the original boundary of two thousand two hundred acres. To this grant Patrick Henry, Governor of Virginia, set his hand, and caused the lesser seal of the Commonwealth to be attached on September 13th, 1785. On February 3d, 1784, a further grant of one hundred and fourteen acres was made to Alexander Bain. In the course of two decades other parties became interested in this vast landed estate, and through either misfortune or mismanagement it became involved, and was sold under a decree of the Federal Court, the deed from Joseph Scott, Marshall of Virginia District, bearing date of December 1st, 1806, and specifying that "By decree of the United States Court pronounced at the May term in 1804, between Phineas Bond, attorney for the creditors of Ezekiel Edwards, plaintiff, and David Ross, John Wickham, and David Hay, defendants," was sold to Thomas Norvell, the entire boundary embracing two thousand six hundred and eight acres. The price paid was $12,900. Later a portion of this land became the property of Samuel White, of "Fort Lewis," Botetourt County, Virginia. Under date of November 22d, 1831. Samuel White in his will bequeathed to Alexander White "the mansion house, the land, and other History of Roanoke County—Roanoke Valley Health Institute things." This included the present "Fort Lewis" now owned by Frank B. Gordon. After the death of Alexander White, by decree of the Court at the June term, 1906, the dwelling house and other buildings, including one hundred and fifty-three and three-fourths acres, reverted to Fannie Penn White. Fannie Penn White in turn conveyed to W. L. Nolen one hundred and forty-nine and twenty-six hundredths acres containing the dwelling house and other contiguous buildings lately described as "Fort Lewis" for the sum of $20,000. Under date of May 26th, 1909, W. L. Nolen conveyed the same property to S. E. Nolen. "Fort Lewis," the stockade fort built by General Andrew Lewis, stood a few yards to the southwest of the present mansion. FRANK BURWELL GORDON Frank Burwell Gordon, the subject of this sketch, is a native of Roanoke County, Virginia, having been born in the Catawba Valley on March 27th, 1867, being a son of John M. and Anne P. (Spessard) Gordon. As a boy he worked on his father's farm and attended the public schools of Roanoke County. During his young manhood he attended the Virginia Polytechnic Institute at Blacksburg, Virginia. After leaving Blacksburg he accepted a position with George W. Palmer at the salt works at Saltville, Virginia. He later accepted a position as bookkeeper for the Bank of Salem. At the age of sixteen he obtained a certificate and taught one session at "The Narrows" schoolhouse on Catawba. In 1895 he resigned the position of bookkeeper in the Bank of Salem and went to South America as the representative of the Comas Cigarette Machine Company, traveling through Brazil and the Argentine Republic. After three years he became the Brazilian Manager for the Vacuum Oil Company, a branch of the Standard Oil Company. He remained with this concern for twelve years, and during that time amassed a considerable fortune. Upon leaving Brazil, Mr. Gordon with his wife traveled around the world, visiting many places of prominence, and finally returning to America in the summer of 1910. In August of that year he purchased the old "Fort Lewis" home in Roanoke County, four miles west of Salem from the widow of the late Dr. W. L. Nolen. He has spent a large sum of money in remodeling this old historic home, a more complete account and a half tone illustration of same appearing on another page of this work. Mr. Gordon in his excellent home, the most palatial of any in the county, with every modern convenience enjoyed by his city and town neighbors, with his wife who was Miss Myrtle Nichols, is leading the life of a simple retired country gentleman. He has accomplished something in the world of business, seen the world from one end to the other and has returned to his native heath, just in the prime of manhood to enjoy the fruits of his labors in foreign lands. He sprang from a prominent Roanoke County family, his grandfather, John Gordon, settled near "Fort Lewis" some twenty years before the Civil War. He came to America from Scotland, and was one of the first to rally to the support of the late Dr. Charles L. Cocke in the establishment of the Valley Union Seminary, now Hollins College in 1846. His father, John M. Gordon, was the oldest of three sons, the others being Charles and Joseph. John M. Gordon was a member of Company I, 28th Virginia Regiment and was wounded near Petersburg, his right arm being shot off at the shoulder joint. When wounded Lieutenant Henry S. Trout was standing by him. He was honorably discharged from the service and after recovering from the effects of the wound returned to his home in Roanoke County. He removed to Elliston, Virginia, in 1890, where he resided until the time of his death. ROANOKE VALLEY HEALTH INSTITUTE (Residence of Dr. H. C. Hart) In the year 1876, Dr. Henry Clay Hart purchased the residence "Magnolia," located one mile from the town of Big Lick, and there established the "MAGNOLIA" Roanoke Valley Health Institute. Dr. Hart, born in 1837 at Wayne, Ashtabula County, Ohio, had graduated in medicine and accepted a position as assistant in Dr. Ingersoll's sanitarium in Corning, New York. While at the latter place the many persons History of Roanoke County—Hollins College from Roanoke and Botetourt counties who came there seeking treatment induced Dr. Hart to establish a similar sanitarium in Virginia, which he did, but was forced by loss of eyesight, in 1886, to discontinue same. The residence "Magnolia" was erected in 1837, and so continued for a time. During the forties the Bristol-Washington and Bristol-Lynchburg and Richmond turnpikes were constructed along in front of the house, whereupon a village was laid out and named Gainsborough, and the house was turned into a tavern, being a regular stop for the stages and wagon trains which ran on these turnpikes. In the fifties, the Virginia &amp; Tennessee Railroad was constructed from Lynchburg to Bristol, traversing Roanoke County. Inasmuch as Roanoke County refused to vote any bonds to help construct the railroad, BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF HOLLINS COLLEGE the promoters thereof built the railroad one mile distant from each of the two principal towns (Salem, the county seat, and Big Lick). After this railroad was constructed the business of Big Lick gradually moved to the railroad, which was then called Big Lick, while the original Big Lick (so named a century ago because of a salt lick frequented by wild animals and located near the plant of the Virginia Bridge and Iron Company) came to be known as Old Lick. Dr. Hart and his wife are still living at the same place. Their children are as follows: William H., machinist and at present farming; Artie S., married E. L. Richardson; George L., shorthand reporter; Clayton I., attorney at law; Lena S., teacher; Della S., married Thomas P. Barnard, and deceased; and Alma G., married J. R. Keyser. HOLLINS COLLEGE No historical record of Roanoke County, in Virginia, can be complete without a history of Hollins College, whose birth was coeval with that of the county. It was in 1842 that Hollins College, seven miles north of Roanoke City, came into existence, just four years after the county was fully established. It has continued until the present time an uninterrupted career, marked by steady growth along all lines. Not even during the dark days of the War between the States were its doors closed; but in spite of many trying vicissitudes, regular scholastic work went on, and many Virginia girls, whose homes lay nearer the seat of war, found a safe and pleasant place of sojourn at this seat of learning, even then old in years and firmly established in the respect and confidence of the people of Virginia. For the first ten years of her life, Hollins, under the name of the Valley Union Seminary, was coeducational, and during that period she sent forth many young men who became prominent in business and professional careers; but in 1852, the Board of Trustees finding that the demand for higher education on the part of the women of the State was becoming greater, decided to close the male department and give more breadth to the development of a college for women. This step was taken under the advice of Charles L. Cocke who had been called in 1846 from a professorship in Richmond College, Virginia, to the presidency of Hollins. It was due to his wise and energetic management up to that time that this step was made possible, and to his keen and intelligent eye the fact became History of Roanoke County—Biographical plain that the Old Dominion State was ripe for a higher and broader education for her daughters. Numerous schools soon sprang into existence, and it is probable that the greatest work which Hollins has done is the inspiration which she gave in the early days to the cause of the education of the young women of Virginia and the South. In the early fifties Hollins, then called the Valley Union Seminary, received a generous gift from Mr. and Mrs. John Hollins of Lynchburg, Va., and in their honor the school was called Hollins Institute, and so it continued until the year 1911, when the General Assembly of Virginia granted a new charter authorizing the name of the institution to be changed to Hollins College. During the years of the War between the States, and for many following, there was much to discourage the hearts of the strong men who were interested in the building up of this institution of learning; but Charles L. Cocke never swerved from his God-inspired purpose, which was to plant on Virginia soil an institution for young women, and to establish therein standards of scholarship which should correspond to those maintained by our best American colleges. Throughout a career of fifty-five years as head of this institution, he bent all his powers to this end, and his success is a matter of history. Up to the year 1868, the patronage of Hollins was entirely from Virginia, but year by year its influence has widened, and the college registers now show students from many states, and a body of Alumnae scattered over the whole Union. The college property is being constantly enlarged to meet the demand, and to-day it includes seven hundred acres in the college grounds and farm, with eight large substantial brick buildings well equipped for the accommodation of two hundred and fifty students and thirty-five officers and teachers. The present President of Hollins College is Matty L. Cocke, daughter of Charles L. Cocke, who was appointed to this position in 1901, at the time of the death of her father—a woman born and reared in the college atmosphere and work, and early dedicated to its service—a southern woman at the head of a southern college. Biographical DR. CHARLES L. COCKE Dr. Charles L. Cocke was born in King William County, Virginia, February 21st, 1820. In early manhood he attended Richmond College, and later Columbian College in Washington, District of Columbia, graduating from the latter institution with the degree of Master of Arts, after which he was elected to the chair of Mathematics in Rich mond College, which he filled for several years. In 1846 he came to Roanoke County to take control of the Valley Union Seminary, later and better known as Hollins Institute, and now as Hollins College. To this institution he devoted his life work with a zeal, courage, and devotion that has had few parallels in the educational development of the South. At that time the doors of no institution in Virginia were open to ambitious young women, where they could enter and carry forward college work under proper training, influenced and guided by correct standards of scholarship. To supply this crying need Dr. Cocke determined to devote his life. When he assumed control of the Valley Union Seminary in 1846, that institution was conducted on the coeducational system, and was so continued for a period of six years afterwards. These years of experience, as well as the conditions incident to such environment, forced him to the conclusion that it was unwise and inexpedient to associate young men and women together in the earlier years of their college work, and the riper experience of his life devoted to the consideration of educational problems in many and broad fields of activity served to convince him that the convictions of his early manhood were confirmed by the experience and judgment of later years. Beginning with the session of 1852, only young women were admitted as students, and from that time on until his death the work of Dr. Cocke was devoted almost exclusively to the building up of a college for young women, the facilities and standards of which should be recognized as being in accord with the best examples of American scholarship. During the next ten or fifteen years, which embraced the Civil War period, the work at Hollins continued under conditions which called for untiring labor and heroic self sacrifice. The war over, Dr. Cocke with redoubled energies set to the work of making Hollins Institute one of the leading colleges of the South. Every resource at his command was availed of in order to rehabilitate and improve the premises. The war period had served to bring the college into prominence as a retreat for many young ladies whose homes lay in the track of invading armies, and in a few years all the Southern States had become patrons of the College. The number of History of Roanoke County—Biographical students increased from year to year, and Dr. Cocke lived to see on the college roll students from practically every state in the Union. Although the larger portion of the energies of Dr. Cocke were devoted to the development of the education of women, yet his activities were not confined wholly to that sphere of work. He was a recognized leader in Christian work and endeavor. He was a devout member of the Baptist Church, and attended and participated in all of its general associations and assemblies. For many years prior to and up until the time of his death, he occupied a position in the forefront of denominational work, which he maintained with ease. Many of the Baptist churches of Southwest Virginia owe their existence to his foresight and untiring energy in bringing about their construction, and to his wise counsel in adjusting and harmonizing their affairs. No journey was considered by him too arduous, nor time consumed ill spent, if the result tended to bring about increased religious zeal and opportunity to the people. Dr. Cocke, during his early career, labored most effectively for the moral and religious uplift of the negro slaves of the county. With the consent of the owners of the larger plantations, on which lived large numbers of slaves, and with their coöperation, he organized a Sunday School which met every Sunday afternoon at Big Lick. Nothing but illness or necessary absence ever kept him away from the sessions of this school, which lasted for a period of twenty years, and during this time, in heat or cold, sunshine or rain, the journey of seven miles was made each Sunday afternoon for the purpose of instructing these humble dependents in the cardinal truths of the Christian religion and in exhorting them to live better lives and build up in themselves a character that would stand for honesty and purity. The school came to an end in reconstruction days. As a citizen of Roanoke County, he occupied a unique and elevated position in the estimation of the people. His accurate business methods and fidelity to every obligation were the necessary results of his career and training. He at all times took an active interest in public affairs of his county and state. In no one, perhaps, did there exist a higher respect for the law and its administration. Dr. Charles L. Cocke was a son of James Cocke, of King William County, Virginia. On December 31st, 1840, he married Miss Susanna V. Pleasants, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Pleasants, of Picquenocque, Henrico County, Virginia. To this union the following children were born: Joseph J., a soldier of the Confederacy, now residing at Brownsville, Texas; Leila V. (Mrs. J. A. Turner), now deceased; Sarah L., now deceased; Mary (Mrs. C. W. Hayward); Rosa (Mrs. W. R. L. Smith), now deceased; Charles H., now deceased, but for many years connected with his father in the conduct of Hollins Institute; Matty L., his successor, and now President of Hollins College; Lucian H. Cocke, General Attorney of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company; and Bessie V. (Mrs. J. P. Barbee), now associated in the management of the College. Dr. Charles Lewis Cocke, while on a visit to his son, Honorable Lucian H. Cocke, at Roanoke, Virginia, was stricken with a fatal illness and died there May 4th, 1901. His body lies buried in the family graveyard overlooking Hollins College, to whose upbuilding his life had been devoted, and whose founder he was. WILLIAM WILBERFORCE BERKELEY William Wilberforce Berkeley, the gentleman whose name captions this article, was born in King and Queen County, Virginia, in 1844, and is a son of William Henry Berkeley, a civil engineer and one of the first railroad engineers in the state of Virginia. The subject of this sketch was reared in his native county until he was seventeen years of age, when he entered the Confederate Army as a member of an independent company organized by General W. H. F. Lee, and called "Lee's Virginia Rangers." In August, 1861, the company was mustered into the regular army at Ashland, Virginia, and joined General Loring in western Virginia. Upon his return it was attached to the army of General Robert E. Lee, and served in the cavalry division until the surrender at Appomattox Courthouse. Mr. Berkeley returned to his native county in 1865 and spent a year in study at a preparatory school at Aberdeen, after which he went to Washington County, Virginia, where he acted as a tutor in the family of Colonel Robert W. Hughes for four years. August 13th, 1870, Mr. Berkeley was united in marriage to a daughter of Thomas Read and a granddaughter of Colonel William M. Peyton, wh was one of the largest land owners in this section of the State. As a result of this union there were six children born, as follows: Mrs. Henry A. Smith, Mrs. Harry Boaz, Mrs. George H. Casky, Thomas Read, Beverley, and Nelson Berkeley. Mr. Berkeley was admitted to the bar in Roanoke in 1883, and was one of the most successful practitioners in Southwest Virginia, and during his residence in this county since 1870 he has practiced with Robert E. Scott, Phlegar, and Johnson, and later with the late J. Ran Bryan. Mr. Berkeley has always been a Democrat and most active in the affairs of his party, serving as a member of the Virginia Legislature in 1895 and '96. Captain Berkeley owns a beautiful farm, consisting of several hundred acres, three miles east of Roanoke, and in recent years has practically retired from the practice of law, preferring to spend his time at his palatial home, "Glade Creek." JOHN WILLIAM CHAMBERS John William Chambers is a son of John F. and Mary E. (Childress) Chambers, and was born in History of Roanoke County—Biographical Franklin County, Virginia, April 11th, 1865, and as a boy attended the county schools of Franklin, and afterwards for a session or two the public schools of Big Lick. In 1885 he moved to Bent Mountain, Virginia, where he engaged in farming, and on January 1st, 1886, married Susan Della, daughter of Giles and Ella E. Tyree, of Roanoke County. He resided on Bent Mountain for a period of seventeen years, and planted a fine apple orchard of Ben Davis, Johnson's Winter, Winesaps, and the Delaware Red varieties. The orchard is now bearing and is regarded as one of the best fruit farms in this section of the country. Nine years ago he moved his family to Roanoke, and later bought a tract of land containing twelve acres on the Franklin Road, just one mile south of the city. He built a fine residence on this tract, which he occupies with his family. This small farm contains one of the largest orchards of Keifer pears in the county. Mr. Chambers is one of the county's most progressive citizens and has at all times taken an active interest in the development of the horticultural interests of this section of the State. He is a stockholder of the City National Bank of Roanoke, Virginia, and through his thrift and enterprise has succeeded well. To his marriage with Miss Tyree the following children were born: Earnest Lee, married and resides at the old home place on Bent Mountain; Mary Ella, married R. A. Bondurant, a young Roanoke attorney, and resides on Franklin Road just south of the city; Bessie Alice; Annie Beatrice; Nannie Elizabeth, and Vola Belle. MASON LEE FELLERS Mason Lee Fellers, the subject of this sketch, is a native of Bedford County, Virginia, a son of Peter and Angelina M. (Cook) Fellers, and was born October 10th, 1858. His father was born in Bedford County, on February 8th, 1824, and died May 7th, 1859; his mother was born in Botetourt County, Virginia, August 11th, 1832, being a daughter of Charles and Lydia Cook. Two children were born to Peter and Angelina Fellers, the subject of this sketch and a sister, Mary O. Fellers, who married Edward Nininger, of Roanoke County. When Mason Lee Fellers was seven months old his father died. In 1867 his mother was married to George Riley, who died in August, 1901. At the age of seventeen years he came to Roanoke County and went to live with his brother-in-law on Tinker Creek. The winter months were spent in obtaining an education and in laying for himself the foundation for his successful after life. For a short period he attended the Huntingdon Normal College at Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. One year he clerked in a store at Hollins and one winter taught a public school in Roanoke County. In 1879 he bought a farm, two and one-half miles north of Roanoke, on which he has since lived and prospered, and which is regarded as one of the most valuable farms in the county. It comprises one hundred and twenty acres and is in a high state or cultivation. Besides the avocation of farming, Mr. Fellers has been actively engaged in other business pursuits, that of trucking, manufacturing brick, operating large stone quarries, and contracting for stone foundations. On December 30, 1880, he married Sudie E. Nininger, daughter of William G. and Eliza Nininger, of Daleville, Virginia. The following children were born to this union: Mary E., married to L. N. Kinzie, of Troutville, Virginia; William B. Fellers, M. D., practicing his profession in Roanoke, Virginia; Stanford L., a law student at Washington and Lee University; Bessie H., who resides with her parents. Mr. Fellers is a man of indomitable energy, keen foresight, and all his acts of life have been governed by a high sense of honor. He emerged from the boom of the early nineties almost hopelessly bankrupt and over $17,000 in debt. With a high sense of honor he set to work to pay off this large sum with no assets other than a small farm. Stock in defunct land companies was paid and a $3,000 security debt hung over him. The continuous growth of Roanoke in recent years was of great value to Mr. Fellers. He cut up a portion of his farm into small tracts, from which he realized the sum of $20,000. With other lands in which he invested, his holdings are easily worth from $50,000 to $60,000. Mr. and Mrs. Fellers are communicants of the Brethren Church. He is a School Trustee for Big Lick District, an ardent advocate of the education of the masses, and stands for the progress and uplift of his county in every way. GEORGE MONROE MUSE Roanoke County has been exceedingly fortunate in having for its Treasurer Mr. George M. Muse, who was elected to the office in the year 1891, nineteen years ago, and who has filled it with the greatest efficiency ever since. Despite opposition, which was at times most strenuous, he has always been successful in his candidacy, being chosen for his position five times in succession. So great is his popularity in the county that at the last election no one else ventured to enter the race, which means, of course, that he was practically the unanimous choice of his constituents. This result is not surprising when one considers the sterling integrity of his character and the highly satisfactory manner in which he has discharged his duties. Careful and History of Roanoke County—Biographical painstaking in every department of his work, impartial in all of his decisions, and absolutely fair in his transactions, he has merited the support of his county and has abundantly deserved the success which he has achieved. Mr. Muse's home is near the town of Vinton, in the eastern end of the county, but he is known and honored from Blue Ridge to the Montgomery line. He is a son of the late William Muse, a man of prominence in his day, whose fine traits of character have been inherited by his son. His father served in the Confederate Army, being a member of the Thirty-Sixth Regiment, Virginia Infantry. Mr. Muse married Miss Mary Richardson, of Roanoke County, and has a large family of bright and happy children. In the Masonic fraternity he has for years filled important positions, being at one time Worshipful Master of the Vinton Lodge, and has often been a representative of that Lodge in the Grand Lodge of Virginia. In politics he is, of course, a Democrat and a staunch and able member of the party, always ready and willing to contribute to its campaigns and to devote his energies to the upbuilding of its principles. In recognition of his valuable services, he has been made a member of the State Executive Committee, a position that always marks a man as a leader and a wise counsellor. Mr. Muse and his wife are members of the Methodist Church. DAVID H. CHRISTIAN David H. Christian, Superintendent of the Roanoke Almshouse, Roanoke, Virginia, was appointed to fill that position in May, 1898, by the City Council, and for his competent and efficient management has been continuously reölected ever since that time. He was born in Nelson County, Virginia, March 25th, 1849, being a son of James B. and Lucy J. (Kyle) Christian. His childhood and early manhood were spent on the farm with his parents and he attended the schools of his native county, obtaining a fair education. He was a member of a "Home Guard" and was called out twice for service in the Civil War. Upon reaching manhood, he engaged in railroad work, which he followed for a period of nine years. He came to Roanoke in January, 1891, and conducted a produce house under the firm name of D. H. Christian &amp; Company and for a while was connected with the firm of Hudson &amp; Christian in the same line of business. For the past fourteen years he has had the management and control of the "poor" farm owned by the city of Roanoke and resides some two and one-half miles south of the city. On December 20th, 1883, he married Annie E. Taliaferro, daughter of Arthur and Ann Taliaferro of Nelson County. To this marriage one daughter was born, Miss Ethel Christian, who died August 23d, 1900, after reaching womanhood. Politically Mr. Christian is a pronounced Prohibitionist. Religiously he is a member and a deacon of the Jefferson Street Baptist Church. Fraternally he is an Odd Fellow and a member of the Knights of the Mystic Chain. As an official of the city he has performed his duty well and has been faithful to the trust imposed in him at all times. Mrs. Christian died in August, 1899. LEWIS L. GREENWOOD The Commissioner of Revenue for District No. 2 of Roanoke County, comprising Big Lick, Cave Spring, and the town of Vinton, is Mr. L. L. Greenwood. His father was S. H. C. Greenwood, a well-known and highly esteemed farmer. Mr. Greenwood's home is at Cave Spring, in that section of the county where many famous apple orchards are located, and where success and prosperity are being won by many of its citizens. For a number of years Mr. Greenwood was Deputy Treasurer for Cave Spring District, and the acceptable manner in which he discharged his duties laid the foundation for his successful candidacy for the position as Commissioner. As Deputy Treasurer he came in close contact with practically every resident of his district, and the fact that he won popularity while engaged in this work speaks eloquently for his efficiency and tells of the kindness and consideration which he showed to those from whom he collected taxes. In his work as Commissioner of the Revenue he has fully maintained the fine record for ability established by him in former years, and the hold which he has on the affections and esteem of the people promises him a long tenure of office. Before entering public life, Mr. Greenwood was a farmer, interested in the cultivation of his place near Cave Spring, and he still devotes care and attention to his agricultural interests. His office is in the new courthouse at Salem, and those who call to see him are always sure of a cordial and pleasant welcome. As Commissioner, Mr. Greenwood succeeded Mr. D. E. Kefauver, and he has served for eight years. Not long ago he married Miss Corelia I. Whitten, of Texas, a Southern lady of rare attractiveness, whom he met while she was visiting in his community. She died not long after their marriage, but her life in Roanoke County, brief as it was, was sufficiently long to impress upon those who knew her the beautiful and noble qualities of her character. History of Roanoke County—Biographical ROBERT F. WYATT Robert F. Wyatt, who recently purchased the Berry store property, the "Cave Spring" and other properties at Cave Spring in Roanoke County, and who is now engaged in mercantile pursuits, was born near Martinsville, Henry County, Virginia, on June 16th, 1861, being a son of John Walter and Malinda H. (Scott) Wyatt. His paternal grandfather, Posey Wyatt, lived at Leatherwood, and his maternal grandfather, Samuel Scott, was a native of Bedford County. Robert F. Wyatt attended the "old field" schools of Henry County in his boyhood. While he was an infant his father joined the Confederate Army, being a member of Company "A" 24th Virginia Regiment. He was captured and died in Elmira prison in 1864. At the age of twenty, Mr. Wyatt located in Roanoke and was engaged in construction work on the Shenandoah Valley Railroad. He later assisted in building several branches of the Norfolk &amp; Western, and was similarly engaged in work on the Atlantic &amp; Danville and the Georgia, Carolina &amp; Northern Railroads. In 1892 he returned to Roanoke and engaged in the construction of the city sewage system. The following January, he located in Washington, D. C., and was engaged in the construction of a railroad which failed, ruining him financially. In 1894 he went to Jamaica and assisted in building a railroad from Port Antonio to Kingston, afterwards spending two years in the West Indies and South America. After much travel he returned to Washington, D. C., in 1896, and engaged in installing the underground current for the Washington Street Railway System, and superintended the construction of the experiment and model tank of the Washington Navy Yard. On December 25th, 1898, he married Agnes E. Sandsbury, daughter of John T. and Sarah E. (Brown) Sandsbury of Prince George County, Maryland. From this union three children resulted: Violet R., born April 25th, 1900; Gracie H., born March 20th, 1901; Robert C., born April 8th, 1906. On September 30th, 1911, Mr Wyatt with his interesting family moved to Cave Spring where he is now engaged in mercantile pursuits. He has just completed a handsome residence. He will also improve the "Cave Spring," the water of which possesses fine medicinal qualities. TAZEWELL MERRIMAN STARKEY For many years one of the most prominent men in Roanoke County was the late Tazewell Merriman Starkey. He was born in Franklin County, Virginia, in December, 1829, and died January, 1910. He was a son of Mr. and Mrs. Jack Starkey, and was educated in the private schools of his native county. He came to Roanoke County in 1850 and was engaged in farming. After the Civil War he purchased one of the finest farms in Roanoke County, near Cave Spring, where he resided until the time of his death. He was one of the first directors of the First National Bank, and served in that capacity until the time of his death. He was a large owner of Roanoke County lands. The Norfolk &amp; Western station at Starkey was named in his honor. For a period of twenty-eight years he was a member of the Board of Supervisors of Roanoke County from Cave Spring District. He was a valiant Confederate soldier, serving in the Fifth Virginia Cavalry. He was wounded in the Seven Days' Fight around Richmond, and had three horses shot under him. Seven other bullets pierced his jacket, but otherwise left him unharmed. In May, 1865, he was married to Henrietta P. Harvey, daughter of Colonel and Mrs. Robert Harvey, of Roanoke County, and as a result of that union there were four children; namely, Mrs. Junior W. White, of Cave Spring; Mrs. Eliza B. Smith, of Roanoke; H. Clay Starkey, of Roanoke; and Joseph G. Starkey, who resides at the old homestead. Mr. Starkey was a man of keen business ability, and in his death the county lost one of its most prominent and progressive citizens. DAVID WILLIAM GOOD David William Good, the subject of this sketch, is the largest and most important packer of canned goods in Roanoke County, and operates at Starkey Station, seven miles south of Roanoke, under the name of the Shenandoah Packing Company, putting up the famous "Shenandoah" brands of tomatoes, apples, beans, and sweet potatoes. The business was organized seven years ago with D. Saylor Good, brother of the proprietor, as a partner. One year later, D. William Good purchased his brother's interest. The Shenandoah Packing Company puts up annually about eleven thousand cases History of Roanoke County—Biographical of canned goods, and it is the intention during the present year to increase the output to twenty thousand cases. His post office is Farland, Virginia. Mr. Good was born in Shenandoah County, Virginia, January 15th, 1867, and as a boy worked on his father's farm and attended the county schools. He afterwards attended Bridgewater College, and took a commercial course at a business college in Valparaiso, Indiana. In 1888 he located at Roanoke, where for a period of seventeen years he was engaged in the wholesale and brokerage business. Being eminently successful, he saw greater opportunities in the packing business, and at once established a large sanitary packing plant with ample railroad siding for the conduct of the business, and began putting up meritorious goods of excellent quality, which at all times command the highest prices in the open market. D. William Good is one of ten children born to Samuel and Sarah (Wampler) Good, his father being a native of Rockingham County, Virginia, and of German ancestry. In 1896 he married Jessie Potter, daughter of M. G. and Mahala Potter, of Sheldon, Illinois, and who died in 1901. He married secondly, in October, 1902, Lizzie Murphy, daughter of John F. and Sarah Murphy, of Amsterdam, Botetourt County, Virginia. To this union the following children have been born: Elizabeth Gertrude, William Frederick, Grace Rebecca, and Annie Ruth. GEORGE GARST George Garst, in his day, one of the most widely known of Roanoke County's citizenship, was born in Franklin County, Virginia, November 15th, 1821, being a son of Jacob and Tamsy Garst. He was one of five children born to them, there being three sons and two daughters. As a young man he chose to be a miller by trade, and began life at the Bonbrook Mills in Franklin County. He then located at the Deyerle Mill in Roanoke County, some three or four miles southwest of Big Lick, now Roanoke. After some years he became the owner of this valuable mill property which is still operated by his son, Jacob Garst. He married first, Mary Ann Linkenhoker, and to them five children were born: Elizabeth, who died at eighteen years; John Henry, who left home soon after Lee's surrender and was never heard from; Taylor, who died last year in Patrick County; Fannie, married Jacob Bittenger, resides in Chicago; Julia, married Ballard P. Linkenhoker. His wife died May 21st, 1854. George Garst married secondly, Mary Frances Lockett on June 14th, 1855. To this union ten children were born as follows: Jacob Benjamin; Jane Anne, married to W. T. Lockett, now deceased; Forest J. and Jack, who reside at Boone Mill, Franklin County, Virginia; Susan Mildred, married to George Haislip; Charles William, resides in Botetourt County, Virginia; Eliza K. Neal, married to James A. Peters, resides in Roanoke; Maggie Lewis, married to W. C. Leslie, both deceased; Robert L. died in Alabama, and Frank Garst, the latter residing with his mother at the old home place. Jacob Benjamin Garst, who married Sue Peters, has a most interesting family of eleven children, there being eight daughters and three sons. He operates the Garst Mill, and a large tomato canning establishment, and resides in a modern home near the mill. Frank Garst married Julia Sink of Franklin County, and seven shildren have been born to this union, two of whom are dead. Beside the numerous living children of the late George Garst, who died July 3d, 1890, he is survived by a large number of grandchildren and great grandchildren. The family has been prominent in the development of Roanoke County for more than half a century. BENJAMIN T. TINSLEY Benjamin T. Tinsley, a son of William and Amorilla Tinsley, was born in Franklin County, Virginia, January 7th, 1813, and died in Roanoke County, Virginia, January 5th, 1880. At one time he was a large land owner in Roanoke County, being the possessor of much of the land on which Roanoke City is now built. In 1859 he purchased from William M. Peyton the boundary of land between Franklin Road on the west and the Carr farm, now known as Belmont, on the east, and from Tazewell Avenue on the north southward to the top of Mill Mountain. This extensive boundary was situated between the lands of E. G. McClanahan on one side and Colonel George P. Tayloe on the other. Mr. Tinsley married Emaline Sydney Trent, daughter of Thomas and Martha Trent, of Buckingham County, Virginia. She was a sister of the late Captain William H. Trent, who for many years was Deputy Clerk of the Hustings Court of Roanoke. Mrs. Tinsley was born November 25th, 1824, and died June 18th, 1892. To the union of Benjamin T. Tinsley and Emaline S. Trent the following children were born: May T., married Captain E. T. Kindred; Thomas Wells, died in infancy; William H., who resides in Salem and is extensively engaged in the real estate business, with his son, Benjamin Tinsley, operating under the firm name of W. H. Tinsley &amp; Son; James, who died in infancy; Martha H., now Mrs. W. H. Taylor, of Washington, D. C.; and three daughters who died in infancy. History of Roanoke County—Biographical Benjamin T. Tinsley was at one time the owner of Elmwood, the beautiful home of the late Peyton L. Terry, on South Jefferson Street, and which was recently acquired for park purposes by the city of Roanoke. At the time of the death of Benjamin T. Tinsley, a local newspaper published the following: "As a man he was honest in everything, tolerant in all he did and said, charitable to every human being he knew. He lived a credit to his species, and died regretted by every one that had the privilege of knowing him." William H. Tinsley, one of the sons of Benjamin T. Tinsley, married Helen Galloway Johnston in 1878. She was a daughter of J. W. and Margaret Galloway Johnston, and a granddaughter of Dr. John and Bettie Bell Johnston, of Roanoke County, Virginia. To this union three sons were born; namely, Benjamin T., in business with his father; A. M., and W. B. Tinsley, all of whom reside in Salem. HISTORY OF SALEM James Simpson has the honor of being the founder of the town of Salem. The land on which the original town was built was comprised in a tract of thirty-one acres purchased by him on October 15th, 1800, from William Lewis, one of the sons of General Andrew Lewis. The price paid was $100. The thirty-one acres was from an original tract of six hundred and twenty-five acres, granted to General Andrew Lewis by patent under date of September 10th, 1767. The tract on which the original town was laid out extended from the junction of Craig Avenue with Main Street to Union Street, and embraced the land lying between Clay Street on the north and Calhoun Street on the south, and also a triangle running up to near the old town poorhouse property. The town was not laid out until the year 1802, and the original town site embraced sixteen acres, which extended from Union Street, formerly known as Limestone Street, to Church Alley, just west of the Hotel Salem. The land was laid out in squares, streets and alleys, forming an oblong checkerboard, so to speak, on which the game of town building was begun on June 4th, 1802. James Simpson made the first move. The town lots faced on Main Street, the two streets to the north and south not then being named. It was several years before the remaining fifteen acres, extending from Church Alley to the Cove Road, were laid off into town lots. The site chosen for Main Street was along the great road, which was one of the chief thoroughfares traveled by the emigrants from Maryland, Pennsylvania, and the East on their way to form settlements in Tennessee and Kentucky, as well as those who settled in Montgomery and Washington counties. McCauley says, "This road followed the great trail made by the moccasined feet of the Indians, in their hunting excursions, their hostile expeditions, and their embassies of peace." The name of James Simpson, the founder of Salem, is no longer preserved in connection with the town. Scant honor was rendered his memory for a time by designating one of the cross streets of the town as "Simpson Street," but years ago it was given the more high-sounding title of "Virginia Avenue." In the original conveyances, the little stream which flows through the eastern part of the town was known by his name, but it has long since been abandoned. In the year 1802, the founder of the town of Salem resided on a farm of one hundred and twenty-six acres adjoining the town on the southwest and afterwards designated as the "Mermaid Tract." Later he lived near the residence of the late Mrs. McFarland and Mrs. Tompkins. Mr. Simpson, as the records will show, was the owner of considerable landed estates. His daughter married Griffin Lamkin, proprietor of the Mermaid Tavern, one of Salem's early houses of entertainment. He was sportively inclined, owned his "coach and four," was a lover of blooded horses, and maintained a track for racing purposes on his land. First Sale of Lots The first move made by James Simpson on the checkerboard of town building was to sell a lot on June 4th, 1802, to Susanna Cole. The lot was designated as No. 19 on the plat, and was situated on the northeast corner of Main Street and Cherry Alley. It was afterwards sold to Nicholas Shootman, familiarly called by the inhabitants of the town "Honest Nick." Samuel Parrish, one of Salem's most widely known citizens, married a daughter of Mr. Shootman, and he and his good woman lived on this corner for three-quarters of a century. Mr. Parrish died in 1910. Mrs. Parrish is still living. During the summer of the same year lots were sold to David Wade, William Blain, Patrick Glynn, John King, Samuel Cole, Isaac Johnston, Anthony Haden, Henry Snyder, and James Godwin. The records show that in 1804 lots were sold to Samuel Lewis, Thomas Armstrong, Tilghman West, and George Hartman. It is safe to state that houses were erected on all, or nearly all, of these lots, but few of them remain as impressive memorials of their builders. In a house built on the site now occupied by E. M. Fitzgerald as a store, and known for many years as the "Godwin House," was born the first child in Salem. Her name was Harriet Godwin, daughter of James Godwin. She grew up and became the wife of William Snyder. The names of all the original lot owners in Salem have disappeared from the tax lists. John King, one of the original lot owners, was a jolly Irishman, as evidenced by the deed of transfer of his lot, which is a matter of record at Fincastle, the preamble of which reads as follows: "This indenture made this 20th day of April, in the year of Our Lord 1825, between John King, originally an emigrant from the sod, viz, the land of Buttermilk and Potatoes, or in other words, the Kingdom of Ireland, but now a sojourner in the United States of America, at home everywhere and nowhere, of course, of no fixed residence, of the one History of Roanoke County—Salem part, and John A. Blevins of the town of Salem, in the county of Botetourt, and State of Virginia, of the other part." It was four years after the town was laid out before any cognizance was taken of it by the State Legislature, but on January 6th, 1806, the General Assembly passed an Act entitled "An Act establishing a town on the land of James Simpson in the county of Botetourt." The Act recited that the land was already laid off and was situated in the upper end of the county of Botetourt, and the name designated was "Salem." It would be a matter of interest to know why the name "Salem" was selected, but there is nothing in the records to indicate the reason, and on this subject tradition is silent. The following gentlemen were named as trustees: James Mason, William Lewis, Elijah McClanahan, William Blain, Lewis Cooper, John King, and John Brugh. The Act further provided that "The trustees of the said town, or a majority of them, are empowered to make such rules and orders for the regular building of houses therein as to them shall seem best, and to settle and determine all disputes concerning the bounds of lots. So soon as the purchaser of any lot in the said town shall have built a dwelling house thereon equal to twelve feet square, with a brick or stone chimney, such purchaser shall enjoy the same privileges that the freeholders and inhabitants of other towns, not incorporated, hold and enjoy. Vacancies by death or otherwise of any one or more of the trustees shall be supplied by the remaining trustees or a majority of them, and the persons so elected shall have the same power as if they had been named in this Act." Original Trustees James Mason, at the date of the above Act, was an extensive owner of Botetourt lands. He was a friend of Colonel Elijah McClanahan and in his will named him as his executor. It is generally believed that from him Mason's Creek and Mason's Knob, a lofty mountain peak on the southern border of the county, were named. Mason's Fort, located in the vicinity of Crystal Spring, was in all probability named after James Mason. William Lewis was the fifth son of General Andrew Lewis, and was at the time of the passage of this Act the owner of a valuable farm adjoining the town, which had been devised to him by his father, as well as other lands in Western Virginia. He married twice. His first wife was Lucy Madison, a sister of James Madison, first Bishop of Virginia. His son, Andrew Lewis, was a noted physician of his day who lived during his last years in Salem and died there. The second wife of William Lewis was Nancy McClanahan, a sister of Colonel Elijah McClanahan. They had several children, most of whom settled in Alabama. Colonel Elijah McClanahan was prominent in the county's early history and died shortly before the Civil War. He was commissioned one of the county justices at the organization of Roanoke County, and was appointed its first High Sheriff. He was a large land owner in the county and resided in the vicinity of Peters Creek on a fine farm near the present city of Roanoke. Many of his descendants are now living in Roanoke County and Roanoke City. His son, E. G. McClanahan, was the owner of one thousand eight hundred acres of land just south of the city of Roanoke. William Blain was a native of Ireland. He had the distinction of having built the first house in the town of Salem from logs cut from the surrounding lots. It was owned and occupied by the late Judge Henry E. Blair for many years. It was finally torn down and a handsome residence erected on the old site. He died intestate in 1819, and never having been naturalized, his property was liable to escheatment by the Commonwealth, but a special Act of the Legislature was passed February 3d, 1821, in which the same was released to his daughter Margaret, who had married Joseph Gray, also a native of Ireland, neither of whom had become naturalized. Mrs. Samuel Parrish is the owner of a bureau which was brought from Ireland by Samuel Blain, and given by him to her father. He was the great grandfather of Mrs. Margaret J. Craig, of Salem. John Brugh was an antecedent of the numerous "Brugh" family of Botetourt County. He was a large land owner and possessed a valuable tract north of the town of Salem, and when the town limits were extended he supplied sixteen acres of the land for the extension. John Brugh, a prominent citizen of Botetourt County, now deceased, was the uncle of John Brugh, one of the trustees of Salem. As to Lewis Cooper, one of the first trustees of the town of Salem, nothing has been left in the records of the town or of the county to indicate his prominence or achievements. That he was a substantial citizen of his day and time goes without saying, when the position to which he had been appointed by the Virginia Legislature, and the character of the men with whom he was associated is considered. John King was evidently a native of Ireland. Whatever degree of prominence he attained in the early history of the town has been lost or it was never recorded. On June 8th, 1802, he purchased lots two and three of the original Simpson plot of the town. This ground is now owned by ex-Mayor William T. Younger, and on which he resides. That he lived in Salem for nearly a quarter of a century is evidenced by a deed from him to John A. Blevins History of Roanoke County—Salem in which he conveys to the latter the two lots purchased by him when the town was first laid off. Judging from the preliminary clause of the deed, he must have had an overplus of Irish humor. The clause referred to is quoted above. By an Act passed in 1813, the town limits were extended from Church Alley to Strawberry Alley, inclusive, on the east, to lots fourteen and thirty-four (W. B. Bowles's) and lots fifteen and thirty-five, inclusive, on the west (C. P. Ehrman's). The progress of the town up to this period had been necessarily slow. It was far removed from the county seat, and other than a most attractive location, possessed nothing to attract population, save the one advantage of being located on the great natural line of communication between the eastern towns and counties and the great West to which the eyes of many thousands of pioneers were turned. The town occupied something of a central position between the ranges of mountains known as the Alleghany and the Blue Ridge, amidst a land of beauty and delight, ever satisfying to every sense of both sight and taste. The climate was all that could be desired, being seldom too warm in summer or too cold in winter. In a few years the town became an active, busy place. About thirty houses had been built and all were strung along Main Street. The population was at that time about one hundred and fifty. Salem was a great place for the weary traveler to refresh and rest himself, judging by the number of taverns that thrived here in those days. On the site where the Critz Building now stands was the "Indian Queen." At the corner of Main and Broad streets was "The Globe," where could be found "refreshments for man and beast." A little out of town and to the southwest stood the "Mermaid Inn." Towards the west end near the Dry Branch there stood a brick building known as the "Bull's Eye Tavern." It was at this house that President Andrew Jackson often stopped and was entertained on his way to Washington from his home, the "Hermitage," in Tennessee. A long time ago this same building was occupied by Dr. Dillard as a residence, but some years ago it was torn down, and on its site was built the splendid modern home of James C. Langhorne. "Ye old-time tavern" has been relegated to oblivion long years ago, and in more recent times the houses of entertainment in Salem have been known more by the names of their proprietors, as follows: Chapman's, Williams or Central, Waugh's, Barnett's, Duval House, Huff House, Virginia House, Lake Spring Hotel, Hotel Lucerne, The Crawford, and Hotel Salem. Lake Spring Hotel was destroyed by fire, and after the boom in 1890, '91, and '92, the Hotel Salem was converted into a Lutheran Orphanage. Roanoke Navigation Company In 1815 an impetus was given to the growth of the town by the organization of the "Roanoke Navigation Company," which had been chartered by the Virginia Legislature. The object of the company was to improve the navigation of Roanoke River, by means of sluices and dams from Weldon, North Carolina, to Salem, the town to be the head of navigation. Business of every kind was on the move. Several business houses were erected. At the corner of Main and Limestone (now Union) streets was erected a large brick building by William Ross and William C. Bowyer, designed for a large wholesale business. This quaint structure is still standing. The Salem Mills were built about the same time, and Union Street was laid out as the main thoroughfare from the main part of town to the head of navigation near the mills. The Navigation Company succeeded in bringing one batteau boat through to Salem. The day of its arrival was an eventful one in the town's history. Nearly a century has elapsed since this historic event. The great navigation scheme exploded, however, and this quaint building remains as a monument to the endeavors of the public spirited citizens of the time in their endeavor to connect Salem with the Atlantic Coast with a permanent navigable waterway. In 1819 there was but one church building in Salem. It was located at the end of Church Alley, and was used as a place of worship by the Methodists. All denominations represented in the young town, however, used it. The next church was built by the Presbyterians and occupied the present site of the public school building. Later a Baptist Church was erected on a site in the northeast corner of East Hill Cemetery. The town school occupied this building for a number of years. In 1849, the Virginia Collegiate Institute was removed from Angusta County, and for a while occupied the Baptist Church. This school afterwards became Roanoke College. In later years this church building was blown down by a storm. A few years before the Civil War the present Methodist, Presbyterian, and Lutheran churches were built. It was not until after the close of hostilities that the present Baptist and Episcopal churches were founded. Several colored churches have also been erected since the war. On February 7th, 1829, the boundaries of the town were extended by an Act of the General Assembly. This extension included all of the thirty-one acres conveyed by William Lewis to James Simpson. Town Incorporated, 1836 On March 21st, 1836, the Act of Incorporation was passed. The Act incorporating "The town of Salem in the county of Botetourt" provided for the election History of Roanoke County—Salem of trustees and for all the machinery of municipal government. When the town was thirty years old it had gained considerable prominence, and being located in the midst of a splendid country district, and being the logical site for the capital of a new county, the people were seized with a laudable desire to become independent of the old mother county, Botetourt. The country people heartily seconded the desire of Salem to form a new county, and repeated efforts were made to this end, but without avail, until 1838, when under the superb leadership of John F. J. White, a citizen and business man of Salem, who was ably seconded by John McCauley, the General Assembly was prevailed upon to form Roanoke County from portions of Botetourt and Montgomery, and Salem was made the county seat. Among some of the principal actors in bringing about the separation from the mother county may be mentioned Frederick Johnston, Henry Snyder, Powell H. Huff, Bernard Pitzer, George W. Shanks, Nathaniel Burwell, Henry A. Edmundson, Dr. John H. Griffin, Ira Jeter, VIEW OF THE NEW BUILDINGS—ROANOKE COLLEGE Gymnasium The Commons Dormitory John B. I. Logan, Colonel Henry Chapman, Aaron Barnes, Charles L. Snyder, Joshua R. C. Brown, Zebulon Boone, John P. Kizer, Joseph H. Campbell, James C. Huff, and Abraham Hupp. On March 18th, 1841, an Act was passed transferring all powers and control over the town formerly held by Botetourt County and the officers thereof, and conferring such powers upon the County Court of Roanoke and the Justice thereof. At the February, 1848, term of the Court it was ordered that George W. Shanks, Henry A. Edmundson, and F. Johnston be made Commissioners to lay off into streets and alleys the part of the town enlarged by the Act of February 2d, 1829. The town limits were again extended March 20th, 1850, taking in the blocks of lots north of Clay and south of Calhoun streets. Provision was made for borrowing as much as $2,000 for street and alley improvements. The first meeting of the Town Council was held in the courthouse July 10th, 1849. The first trustees present were George W. Shanks, Powell Huff, J. R. C. Brown, Charles L. Snyder, Abraham Hupp, James H. Duiguid, and John P. Kizer. George W. Shanks was elected President of the Board; Henry E. Blair, Secretary; Ira Jeter, Treasurer; and James C. Huff, Sergeant. All of these first Councilmen have passed to their reward. But little of interest occurred other than the routine labors of this body until March 8th, 1859, a committee was named to consider the propriety of having a public meeting in the town for the purpose of taking the initiatory steps for the construction of a railroad from Salem down the Valley. In the years of 1868 and 1869 references are made in the Council proceedings to the appointment of trustees by the Military Governors of Virginia, Generals Schofield and Stoneman. This was during the reconstruction period. Roanoke College Chartered Roanoke College, the pride of the town, an institution which has made Salem famous as an educational center, was chartered in 1853, with Dr. David F. Bittle as its first President, and to him more than to any other agency does it owe its existence, and its final success through years of bitter struggle. Dr. Bittle, together with Rev. C. C. Baughman, a retired minister of the Lutheran Church, organized the Virginia Collegiate Institute at Mount Tabor, in Augusta County, shortly after the year 1842. The school once begun, the following year a conference was held by representatives of the two Lutheran Synods of Virginia, and the question discussed as to the establishment and maintenance of a classical educational institution in the State. The conference resulted in the adoption of this school, which consisted of two unpretentious log buildings, and in 1845 the school was incorporated by the Legislature of Virginia under the above name. Through the efforts of Rev. Gideon Scherer, pastor of the Lutheran congregation in Roanoke County, and other ministers of the Southwest Synod, the school was removed to Salem in 1847. As stated in another portion of this sketch, the Baptist Church in East History of Roanoke County—Salem Hill Cemetery was occupied by the Institute. The second session was held in the Presbyterian Church. In the summer of 1848 the central part of the main building was put up. In the following year the first attempt at beautifying the grounds was made. It was in these years that the first catalogues were published. The attendance numbered forty students. The second year there were thirty-eight. In the fourth year sixty students were enrolled. In 1853 the Virginia Collegiate Institute became Roanoke College. The trustees named in the charter were Dr. John H. Griffin, Rev. C. C. Baughman, John P. Kizer, Rev. John B. Davis, Rev. James A. Brown, Rev. A. R. Rude, Rev. Elijah Hawkins, Rev. A. P. Ludden, George Shuey, Benjamin F. Hailman, Jacob Baylor, John Groseclose, Michael Miller, George W. Rader, Abraham Hupp, John B. I. Logan, Nathaniel Burwell, and George P. Tayloe. In the spring of 1853, Rev. Mr. Baughman resigned to accept the principalship of Hagerstown Female Seminary. The first session of Roanoke College opened September 1st, 1853. The first meeting of the Board of Trustees was held in April, 1853, and was organized by the election of Nathaniel Burwell, President; S. Carson Wells, Secretary; and John P. Kizer, Treasurer. The Faculty of the College was selected as follows: David F. Bittle, A. M., President and Professor of Moral and Intellectual Science; S. Carson Wells, Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy; Henri G. Von Hoxar, Professor of Ancient and Modern Languages and Literature. The library consisted of one hundred and forty volumes. In the following year, Rev. Daniel H. Bittle, brother of the President, accepted a professorship in the College, which he held for four years. For two more years he was financial agent of the institution. Professor Von Hoxar resigned in March, 1853, and was succeeded by D. Sprecher, of Maryland. In November, 1854, Rev. William B. Yonce was elected tutor and became Principal of the preparatory department. In 1857 the west wing of the college was built. There were a number of changes of minor importance in the Faculty during the years previous to the Civil War, and there was a steady increase in attendance, when at the beginning of hostilities, the catalogue showed an enrollment of one hundred and eighteen. In 1861 the session closed prematurely on June 4th, due to the excitement caused by the professors and students entering the Army of the Confederacy. The sessions of the College, however, continued throughout the war, a special permit having been granted by the Secretary of War, with the proviso that the students should be provided with guns, and weekly military drills held preparatory to defending Roanoke County and adjacent territory in the event of an invasion by the enemy. The College company was in command of Captain George W. Holland, one of the professors, and was called out on several occasions but never fought in any engagement. A period of hardship was experienced by the College immediately after the surrender. Confederate currency was valueless. Students were unable to pay their expenses, and as a consequence there was a suspension of operations. Many of the students who were able returned to their homes. Others assisted Dr. Bittle and Professor Yonce in planting a field of corn. When Hunter's army came to Salem, all the College supplies were seized, including a thousand pounds of meat which had been purchased at the rate of $7 per pound. In the spring of 1863, an effort was made to establish a Confederate hospital in the College, but this was prevented by the appearance of Dr. Bittle, accompanied by the late Judge Waller R. Staples, before the Surgeon General in Richmond, who revoked the order. During Dr. Bittle's absence the College was occupied by soldiers for a day and a night. The year following the war the enrollment was one hundred and seventy-two. In that year there was but one graduate, S. A. Repass, who became an eminent minister and college professor in Pennsylvania. The college was often in need of funds, and at various times donations in the sum of $1,000 were given by the following persons: Michael Miller, John Trout, A. E. Huff, Jacob C. Miller, Jacob Persinger, Samuel Hubbard, Miss Sarah A. Miller, and the Lutheran congregation at Madison Courthouse, Virginia. In 1867-68 a department known as the "Boys' School" was established and Luther Holland was called to the head of this department, which he filled with distinction for thirteen years until his death on December 4th, 1874. In 1871, Julius D. Dreher, a graduate of the College, became connected with the Faculty, and in 1873, Thomas Bittle, son of President Bittle, was made Professor of Modern and Oriental Languages. After four years he resigned and was succeeded by John T. Crabtree, another graduate of the institution. In 1875, the "Roanoke Collegian" appeared with Professor Julius D. Dreher and William J. Smith, a student, as editors. On September 24th of the same year, Dr. Bittle died, and Rev. T. W. Tosh, D. D., succeeded to the presidency of the College. He soon resigned to accept a professorship in the Lutheran Theological Seminary, then located in Salem. The Board of Trustees then elected Dr. Dreher, a member of the Faculty, as President, which position he filled with satisfaction for more than a quarter of a century, resigning in 1903 to accept History of Roanoke County—Salem the position of American Consul at Tahita, Society Islands, and has since been promoted to the consulship at Port Antonio, Jamaica. Dr. John Alfred Morehead, President of Roanoke College, is a native of Virginia and graduated at Roanoke College in 1889. He graduated from Mount Airy Theological Seminary, Philadelphia, in 1892. He served pastorates at Burks Garden and Richmond, Virginia. In 1898 he was made President of the Theological Seminary at Charleston, South Carolina. He traveled and studied in Europe in 1901-02. He was elected President of Roanoke College in 1903. In 1879, Bittle Memorial Hall was built as a home for the excellent library, which now consists of some thirty thousand volumes. The laying of the cornerstone and the inauguration of Dr. Dreher as President took place the same day, both functions being very impressive and marking two important events in the history of Roanoke College. On March 22d, 1895, the College suffered an irreparable loss in the death of Dr. William B. Yonce, Professor of Ancient Languages and Literature, and again on December 7th, 1900, the death angel came and removed from the College the spirit of Dr. Wells, the last survivor of the three great men who started the College on its career and stood by it in all its vicissitudes. This sketch would be incomplete without some mention being made of Rev. F. V. N. Painter, who was called to the chair of Modern Languages in 1880, which position he has filled for thirty-two years. Students have been enrolled, not only from a majority of the states, but from Mexico, Nova Scotia, Cuba, Porto Rico, Jamaica, England, Japan, Korea, and for a third of a century the Choctaw Indians have sent students here. Indians of other tribes have also been enrolled. During the past eight years the teaching force of Roanoke College has increased from ten to nineteen professors, instructors, and assistants. The material equipment has been largely increased and a new biological laboratory installed, and several thousand volumes added to the library. Three new buildings, the Commons, the Dormitory, and the Gymnasium, have been erected at a cost of over $72,000, and are now in use. The productive endowment of the Coliege has more than doubled in the last eight years, now amounting to $137,500. Salem's First Railroad In 1857, the Virginia &amp; Tennessee Railroad was completed to Salem. Four years later, the little town felt the thrill of patriotism which pulsated throughout the entire Southland when Virginia joined the other seceding states. In her quiet streets were heard the spirit stirring drum and the ear piercing fife, the neighing of war steeds and the tramp of armed men. The brave people were rushing to the front by the hundreds to answer to the call of their beloved State. Four companies were formed in Salem and hurried to the front, but for the particulars the reader's attention is called to another section of this History, where a full account of the military operations of Roanoke County is given. Town Limits Again Extended On March 28th, 1871, an Act investing the "Trustees of the town of Salem" with additional rights, immunities, and powers was passed by the General Assembly. The Act also provided for the further extension of the town limits so as to include all houses and lots lying in the immediate vicinity of the town and nominally recognized as a part thereof. The First Council On March 31st, 1873, an Act was passed enlarging the powers of the town to be exercised by the municipal authorities, which were to consist of seven Aldermen to be elected annually by the qualified voters, one of whose number, elected by them, should be Mayor. The Mayor and Aldermen were to constitute "the Council of the town of Salem." Pursuant to this Act the following Aldermen were elected: James Chalmers, Samuel H. Nowlin, John A. McCaull, James W. Chapman, Benjamin G. Morgan, Robert B. McClelland, and Arthur McLavy. The same Act authorized a further extension of the town limits and at the expiration of each fourth year thereafter, unless otherwise ordered by a two-thirds majority vote of the citizens on such propositions to extend. Certain sections of this Act were amended February 25th, 1884, among other things, empowering the Town Council "to purchase a tract of land outside the corporate limits, not exceeding one hundred acres in extent, and to erect thereon buildings and improvements suitable for a poorhouse and hospital." In order to accomplish this, the Council was authorized to borrow $5,000 thereon. The amended Act also provided for the non-taxation of manufacturing enterprises, if the capital invested amounted to $5,000 or more. Boundaries Established On November 19th, 1886, the boundaries of the town were established as follows: "Beginning at a stake on the lands of Mrs. P. C. Chapman, at the southwest corner of the grove opposite J. C. Langhorne's Mill lane; thence a straight line across the McAdam road, and running with the fence on the west side to the mill race; thence with said Langhorne's History of Roanoke County—Salem line to Roanoke River; thence down the northern bank of said river to the ford at James W. Martin's mill; thence with the north side of said mill lane to the south side of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad; thence along the south boundary of said road to a stake opposite the eastern side of the old Burwell brick house, on the lands of S. F. Simmons; thence a straight line to the corner of Austin Garland and Joseph Stoutamire's land; thence with said Stoutamire's line to John Gish's line; thence with said Gish's line to a white oak tree on the hill by the road to the Lick Branch; thence a straight line to C. F. Reed's northern hedge fence, and with same to the line of John H. Camper; thence with said Camper's James Dooley's and the late George Hartman's lines to the Red Lane; thence a straight line to the beginning." By an Act of the Legislature on May 12th, 1887, the limits of the town were considerably contracted. By this Act the western limits were fixed at Lake Spring branch. It was largely through the enterprise of F. J. Chapman that the Salem water works were established, whereby the water from Lake Spring was brought within the reach of every house. Salem's People The manners and character of the people residing in Salem have been molded in the highest type, amid the influences described above, all of which developed a type of people peculiar unto themselves. There is no town in Virginia whose inhabitants are characterized more fully by honesty, probity, and uprightness in all their dealings with their fellow man than the people of Salem. From 1853 up to 1880, Salem existed with her college and the state of affairs as narrated. The town was by no means a stagnant place. The population had grown to one thousand eight hundred people, and contained more wealth and business caliber than any small town in the Southwest. For the next nine or ten years the progress was slow, but in 1889-90 the time came when Salem was to discard the long worn robe of peace and quietude in order to don that of material prosperity. During the years mentioned the place shot up like a meteor, and its growth and development was not excelled by any town of like size and importance along the line of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway, Roanoke excepted. This apparently unexampled were of prosperity was due largely to the formation of joint stock land companies, and the placing of the natural and manifold advantages of the town before the public. This development in the course of two years was the result of the united efforts of such men as A. M. Bowman, D. B. Strouse, J. W. F. Allemong, J. T. Crabtree, Dr. Julius D. Dreher, T. J. Shickel, F. J. Chapman, George Allen, William M. Nelson, and others, all men of determination, energy, and fine business qualifications. The Salem Improvement Company was organized October 2d, 1889, with a capital stock of $300,000, and with authority to increase its capital to $1,000,000. The company purchased nine hundred acres of land, laid it off into lots, with streets sixty to seventy-five feet in width, and on December 11th of the same year the first sale of lots took place. In ten days $300,000 worth were sold. This was virtually the beginning of the development of Salem. Other land companies followed in quick succession, and in the course of a few months something like three thousand acres of fine, productive lands on all sides of the town were cut up into town lots and streets and alleys laid off. The additional land companies were the Salem Development Company, with an authorized capital stock of $1,000,000; the West Salem Land Company, with a capital stock of $500,000, issued in series; the South Salem Land Company, capitalized at $300,000; the Lake Spring Land Company, $100,000 capital; the Creston Land Company, $200,000 capital; the Central Land Company, $80,000 capital; the Glenmore Land Company, $250,000 capital; the Steelton Land Company, $500,000 capital; the Hockman Land Company, $100,000 capital; with several others. From October, 1889, to May, 1890, ten land companies were organized with authorized capital ranging from $80,000 to $1,000,000, and with almost unlimited chartered powers. The Salem Improvement Company erected a handsome hotel and over thirty dwellings were put up on its lands. The Salem Development Company erected an $18,000 bridge over Roanoke River and established water works at a cost of $8,000, piping the water by gravity from a mountain spring three hundred and seven feet higher than any point in the town, and immediately put under construction fifty dwelling houses. The West Salem Land Company erected a new market house, four stores, and a number of dwellings. The men who took the helms of these various organizations started out, not with the purpose of speculation alone, but with the development and upbuilding of Salem as their avowed object. During the year 1890, through the efforts of the various land companies, a number of enterprises and industries had been located in the town. Irresistible inducements were offered outside capital, the logical consequences being that by August of the above named year, beside the coming of industries, two hundred and twenty-eight houses of all kinds had been erected, including one hundred and fifty-nine new residences, thirty-five stores, and other business History of Roanoke County—Salem houses, and thirty-four for various manufacturing enterprises. It has been estimated that $870,000 was spent that year in building operations. Among the new industries secured was an iron furnace, car and machine company, woolen mills, tannery, wagon factory, gas heater factory, folding chair factory, iron works, sash, door and blind factory, ice factory, foundry and machine works, brick and tile works, carriage factory, and grain cradle works. It was estimated that the old and new enterprises secured in that year would give employment to not less than two thousand to two thousand five hundred mechanics and laborers. The principal offices of a number of large industries representing millions of capital were located in Salem during the year 1890. The land companies mentioned above subscribed $250,000 to the capital stock of a $1,000,000 basic steel plant for the manufacture of steel rails, plates, and the like, but the enterprise never materialized. The plant under consideration was the Jones, Laughlin Steel Company, now of Pittsburg. During the years of 1890 and 1891 the growth of Salem was little short of marvelous. A new and handsome stone passenger depot was erected by the Norfolk &amp; Western, pretty villas, cottages, and brick buildings sprang up almost as if by magic, and in every direction, and even with all this the supply was not equal to the demand. There was an air of rapid progress and growth which impressed the visitor or investor most favorably. The increase in the population of Salem was in keeping with her other improvements. It was estimated in October, 1889, that there were some two thousand five hundred people in the town; January 1st, 1891, it was contended that the population had increased to four thousand three hundred and fifty. In less than fifteen months the population had nearly doubled. "Southwest Virginia and Shenandoah Valley," a book published by Thomas Bruce in 1891, gives the following interesting figures, which were based upon the fairest calculations obtainable at the end of 1890, but is only given as an estimate of the property valuation for Salem at the time: Real estate $1,856,493.10 Personal property 769,380.96 Value of capital invested, including various enterprises and stock companies 2,375,000.00 Total values $5,000,874.06 The total assessed property valuation of "Salem of to-day" is just a little over one-half of the estimate given above, as shown by the books of the Commissioner of the Revenue. The figures furnish food for thought. Personal property has almost doubled, being $1,391,730, while real estate has depreciated about one-third, the assessed valuation being $1,191,820, with a total of $2,583,550. The bursting of the "boom" bubble destroyed fictitious values. In 1895 the assessments of Salem property based upon such values were absolutely appalling. Property owners appealed to the Court and the records show one thousand five hundred exonerations. New Town Limits Prescribed To keep pace with the rapid influx of population and activities in the building line, on February 18th, 1890, an Act was passed materially enlarging the town limits. The western boundary was placed two hundred feet west of Langhorne's Mill and the eastern boundary at a point between the lands of the Salem Improvement Company and C. W. Burwell, extending northward to Big Lick turnpike. The last Act prescribing the boundaries of Salem was passed January 30th, 1900. A few minor changes were made in the preceding Act, contracting the eastern limits. During the past two decades the town gradually recovered from the effects of the collapse succeeding the boom. The town constructed and operates an electric light plant, as well as its own water supply, demonstrating fully by low prices for both current and water the feasibility and desirability of municipal ownership of public utilities. Centennial Celebration On Wednesday, June 4th, 1902, the citizens of the town celebrated the centennial anniversary of the first sale of lots by James Simpson, the founder of Salem, which proved a most gratifying success. The town was adorned with flags and bunting and presented a most pleasing appearance to the ten thousand visitors on her centennial day. There was a public parade headed by the Roanoke Machine Works Band, followed by military companies, secret organizations, college faculty and students, school children, orphans from Lutheran and Baptist Orphanages of Virginia, Confederate Veterans, and Grand Army men, fire companies, old citizens, speakers, county officials, and Mayors and town councils of Salem and Roanoke. The address of welcome was delivered by Mayor W. T. Younger, and a historical sketch of Salem was read by the late William McCauley. Major Samuel Griffin, a native of Salem, and the late Judge Henry E. Blair also delivered addresses. Roanoke County's New Courthouse A recent event in the history of Roanoke County was the building of a new courthouse, one of the History of Roanoke County—Salem most modern public buildings in all Southwest Virginia. The Board of Supervisors under whose administration this handsome temple of justice was erected were Stephen Frederick Thrasher, Chairman; Luther Dennis Bell, Baxter White Logan, and George Washington Lewis. The plans were drawn ROANOKE COUNTY COURT HOUSE, SALEM, VIRGINIA by H. H. Huggins, of Roanoke, and in December, 1908, the contract for the erection of the building was awarded to the King Lumber Company, of Charlottesville, on a bid of $43,870. On Friday, April 1st, 1910, Honorable W. W. Moffett, presiding Judge, convened the Roanoke County Circuit Court for the hearing of matters, the receiving and the reading of articles of local historical interest in connection with the opening of the new courthouse building. All of the county officials as well as many prominent visitors were present on this occasion. The oration of the day was delivered by John Peter Saul, Jr., after which many valuable papers bearing directly on the history of the county and of those identified with its early history were read, and ordered spread on the records of the Court. A most interesting feature of the day's proceedings was the acceptance by the authorities of the county of the many life-sized portraits of the distinguished citizens of the county, which had been collected at great personal expense as well as valuable time by Judge William Walter Moffett. This is regarded as the finest collection of historical portraits ever gathered in Southwest Virginia, or perhaps the whole State, and for it the people of the county owe to the untiring efforts of the Judge of the Court their undying gratitude. Roanoke Woman's College During the past year (1911) the progressive citizens of Salem secured for the town the new "Roanoke Woman's College," which is to be erected in the near future on a commanding site a short distance east of the town of Salem. Mayors, Presidents of Council, and Sergeants James Chalmers was the first Mayor of Salem, serving from July 7th, 1873, to July 2d, 1874. Other Mayors in order of their service are as follows: Dr. W. D. Armstrong, July 2d, 1874, to July 5th, 1882; Colonel Robert H. Logan, July 5th, 1882, to July 1st, 1886; William T. Younger, July 1st, 1886, to July 1st, 1906; W. W. McClung, July 1st, 1906, to September 1st, 1910; James A. Persinger, September 1st, 1910, to the present. The Presidents of the Town Council from 1849 to 1873 in the order of their service were: George W. Shanks, Dr. George P. Terrell, George W. Shanks, Bernard Pitzer, George Stevens, Augustus M. Jordan, Samuel H. Nowlin, James Chalmers, and Robert McClelland. The following citizens have acted as Town Sergeants since 1849: James C. Huff, seven years; Robert Stevens, one year; Benjamin Estes, nine months; Samuel Parrish, two years; James C. Huff, eleven years; A. B. Ballard, one year; Peter Magee, four years; Jacob B. Frier, twenty-seven years; J. Harry Chapman, six months; Edward R. Moore, eight years; W. A. Vest, from September 1st, 1910, to the present time. James C. Huff served eighteen years in all. Leading Industries THE SALEM LOAN AND TRUST COMPANY The Salem Loan and Trust Company was organized in 1890 at Salem, Virginia, with Major R. D. Martin as its first President and William T. Younger as Vice President, with a paid-in capital stock of $50,000. Its organization took place at a time when Salem was enjoying an unexampled wave of prosperity. The town was growing rapidly and new enterprises were springing up on every hand. The institution started its business career under the most favorable auspices, and during the later years of depression it weathered the storms of adversity in a most admirable manner. In 1892 William T. Younger succeeded to the presidency, which position he has held until the present day. His personal History of Roanoke County—Salem supervision and painstaking care in the conduct of its affairs have placed the institution on a high financial plane, and to-day it takes front rank among the banking houses of Roanoke County.

Organized nearly twenty-five years ago, the Camden Iron Works is one of the few plants that weathered the storms of adversity in the intervening years since its organization and the present day. Soon after its organization, the sole ownership passed into the hands of Mr. Orran D. Oakey, at that time one of the youngest of Salem's business men. Ten years ago Mr. Oakey assumed the active management of the plant, giving practically his entire time to the business, which has grown, far surpassing his expectations. In recent years a jail-building and construction department was added, and the Camden Iron Works began the building of jails all over the country, until to-day the firm covers all of the southeastern states, where they have erected many strong jail buildings and supplied the steel cages for same under contract. The enterprise's trade in ornamental and structural iron, and cast and wrought iron work extends over the same territory. It is the only concern of like character in all the territory covered by its trade that manufactures and tempers its own tool-proof material used in jail cell work. Among the various articles of manufacture turned out by the Camden Iron Works may be mentioned iron stairways, area gratings, window guards, fire escapes, cellar doors, girders, store fronts, columns, roof trusses, railings, balconies, gates, prismatic lights, stirrups, grilles, steel fences, and jail cells. The above represents only a few of the hundreds of articles included in the finished iron trade turned out by the Camden Iron Works. It is the pronounced intention of the proprietor of the Camden Iron Works to build a substantial new and modern home for the plant in the near future. In fact, much of the preliminary work looking to this end has already been done. The plant at the present time, and with the facilities in hand, employs from forty to sixty skilled mechanics and workmen. The pay roll averages $1,500 to $3,500 per month, the amount of money paid out being dependent largely on the character of work under construction. Beside the men constantly employed at the plant in Salem, additional numbers are employed on construction work in the various Southern states, in order that all contracts may be promptly executed. The general office is in the store of the Oakey Hardware Company, corner of Main and Colorado streets, and the works are located at the intersection of Burwell and Market streets. Orran D. Oakey, who is the sole owner of the Camden Iron Works, is also the proprietor of the Oakey Hardware Company, the oldest hardware firm in Virginia west of Richmond. THE SALEM FOUNDRY AND MACHINE WORKS, INC. This business was established in 1889, and has been in successful operation since that time. In 1906 the company was reorganized and incorporated with J. E. Shank, President; W. S. Shank, Vice President; H. D. Shank, Secretary. In May, History of Roanoke County—Salem 1910, W. B. Wade was elected Vice President. The business is now owned and conducted by the above named gentlemen. This concern manufactures a complete line of modern wheat and corn milling machinery, consisting of the following well-known brands of Salem machines: roller mills, sifters, bolting machinery, purifiers, centrifugal reels, flour dressers, bran dusters, flour packers, corn mills, both portable and stationary, and feed mills. They are prepared to furnish the entire equipment for the building of new mills or the remodeling of old mills. In connection with the above line of machinery, they also make a complete line of transmission machinery, consisting of ring oiling drop and post hangers, pillow bearings, wood split, and iron pulleys, couplings, gearing, etc. They also carry a stock of shafting, belting, and elevator supplies, and operate a repair department, and are prepared to make all kinds of special machinery, patterns, and castings of either brass or grey iron. The officers of this concern are all experienced men in the building of mills and machinery, having had about fifteen years' experience in the designing and building of mills, a large number of which are in successful operation throughout the South. Any work entrusted to them will have the most careful attention. Their shop is equipped with a complete line of iron and wood working machinery, and special machines for the resharpening of mill rolls. A SALEM ROLLER MILL SHANK MILLING COMPANY The Shank Milling Company, Incorporated, was organized in 1910 with the following officers: H. D. Shank, President; R. W. Kime, Vice President; John E. Shank, Treasurer; W. S. Shank, Secretary. Their mill is equipped with a full line of machinery for making one hundred barrels of flour, six hundred bushels of meal, and twenty tons of feed daily, and they enjoy a large local and shipping trade. The latest and most improved equipment with a large number of special machines are employed throughout this ideal mill, and expert flour SHANK MILLING COMPANY makers carefully guard the progress of milling from the moment the wheat first enters the mill until it comes forth in a finished flour product, which is equal to the best on any market and superior to most local made flour. They make the well-known brands of "Old Dominion" and "Valley Cream" flour, and "Pearl Meal," "Purity Stock Feed," and are dealers in corn, oats, daisy middlings, and all kinds of feed. During the two years in which the Shank Milling Company has been in existence a most enviable reputation for high-grade products has been established. The firm is composed of men of unquestioned business ability, and the town of Salem regards the enterprise in a most favorable light. FARMERS' NATIONAL BANK OF SALEM The Farmers' National Bank of Salem was organized in 1871, and besides being one of the strongest financial institutions of the county it is by far the oldest, having withstood periods of depression admirably during its existence of forty-one years, and in times of prosperity has succeeded in building up the financial resources, not only of Salem, but of the county at large. The bank's affairs have at all times been managed wisely and conservatively, with the view of extending aid to the struggling enterprises which have done so much for the upbuilding of the county industrially, as well as to the individual in need of financial assistance. Dr. J. J. Moorman was its first President; he was succeeded by Colonel G. B. Board. Mr. James Chalmers was its third President, and to him is due the credit of bringing the bank safely through one of the most severe panics the country has ever experienced. Mr. F. H. Chalmers has been President of the bank since 1899, having been connected with it for thirty-seven years. Naturally the success and honorable career of an institution, to which he has given lifelong service, is very gratifying to Mr. Chalmers. History of Roanoke County—Salem The following gentlemen composed the first Board of Directors: James Chalmers, John M. Evans, R. B. Moorman, John B. Bransford, John J. Moorman, Sparrell F. Simmons, and D. B. Strouse. The officers of the Farmers' National Bank of Salem are men of the highest business qualifications, and of the strictest integrity.

The Pierpont Brick Works, one of the largest as well as one of the most important industrial enterprises of Roanoke County was established in the spring of 1890, a short distance west of Salem. The enterprise was established by George R. Pierpont, a native of Connecticut, who in later years has been operating the plant in connection with his son, George Earle Pierpont, the father and son being the sole proprietors and managers. Both are gentleman of high business qualifications, of undoubted integrity, and their coming to Roanoke County nearly a quarter of a century ago, added most materially to the industrial development of this section of the State. The plant of the Pierpont Brick Works is located on the Norfolk &amp; Western and the Virginian Railways with sidings from both of these great commercial highways, the shipping point being known as "Pierpont's Siding." Their mail and express office is Salem, Virginia. The capacity of the plant at present is seven and one-half millions of sand moulded, common building brick annually. A large and growing trade has been History of Roanoke County—Salem established throughout Southwest Virginia and Southern West Virginia. The output of the plant has become well known and thoroughly established for high quality among architects and contractors, many VIEW OF PIERPONT BRICK WORKS FROM MACADAM ROAD, LOOKING EAST of whom specify the use of "Pierpont" bricks in their plans for construction work. Many of the most modern and most substantial buildings in Roanoke and Roanoke County erected in recent years have been constructed of brick from these yards. Among them may be mentioned three of the Baptist Orphanage buildings; the new Methodist and Episcopal churches; the new Roanoke College buildings; the Roanoke County jail; the fine residences of J. C. Langhorne, Charles D. Denit, Rev. E. W. Hubard, and W. E. Wolfenden of Salem, and the new auto fire houses; the Jefferson Apartment House, nearing completion; the Jefferson Hospital; the new Horton Building, as well as many others, in Roanoke and neighboring towns, also the new buildings of Hollins College. The brick yard is located in close proximity to immense clay deposits specially adapted for the manufacture of first ass commercial building brick. The shipping facilities are of the best, and since the plant has been in operation the firm has been enabled at all times to supply either large or small orders on the shortest possible notice. The plant and office are located on a seventy-four acre tract of fine Roanoke County clay lands, and to the splendid shipping facilities mentioned above, may be added the rock road for local orders which cuts the farm in two and passes right by the immense yards. As a leading industrial plant of the county, about forty or fifty skilled laborers including men and boys are given constant employment. The equipment including brick machines, kilns, dryers, and buildings is all modern and up to date in every particular. The proprietors have spared neither pains nor expense in modernizing this plant in order to meet the ever growing demands for their products. THE BANK OF SALEM The Bank of Salem, a state banking institution, was organized in 1891 with Theophilus J. Shickel as President, and with a paid-in capital stock of $50,000. At the present time the bank carries a surplus of $20,000 with undivided profits amounting to over $6,000. From the time of its first organization the affairs of the bank have been conducted conservatively and well. Its integrity and financial standing have been closely guarded by its officers and those entrusted with the handling of its business. It has been a favorite place for the deposit of funds by the people of Salem and of Roanoke County. Starting business when the boom was at its height, and large sums of money were exchanging hands daily, so well was the business conducted that when the years of depression came, almost immediately after its organization, it was enabled at all times to pay currency for all checks drawn against the deposits in its vaults. To-day the bank stands out prominently on the county's financial horizon. In its past history it has been of inestimable value in the way of extending financial aid to worthy enterprises and to individuals of the county of Roanoke. The officers of the Bank of Salem are all shrewd business men, and all successful in their sphere of life. They are as follows: A. M. Bowman, President; R. W. Kime, Vice President; J. H. Chapman, INTERIOR BANK OF SALEM Cashier; Miss Anna M. Davis, Assistant Cashier. The gentlemen named, with Charles D. Denit, G. Sheldon Bowman, O. D. Oakey, H. S. Trout, and W. R. Hester, constitute the Board of Directors.

M. BOWMAN Roanoke County's Representative in the Virginia House of Delegates Honorable A. M. Bowman, Roanoke County's representative in the Virginia House of Delegates, is a resident of Salem, but a native of Rockingham County, where he was born January 11th, 1847. He received his education in the common schools and at New Market Academy. In 1863, at the age of sixteen, he enlisted in Company H, Twelfth Regiment, Virginia Cavalry, and took part in the battles of Spottsylvania Courthouse, Yellow Tavern, and in the cavalry fights around Gettysburg, Petersburg, and Richmond. He was taken prisoner at Mount Crawford during Sheridan's raid through Virginia, in March, 1865, and sent to Fort Delaware, where he remained until after the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox. After the close of the war he returned to his native state to take up the battle of life in his beloved, though desolated, Southland. He began life after the war as a farmer and cattle raiser, and has made a specialty of raising registered Jersey stock, shipping fine cattle to all parts of the United States and Canada. He is owner and proprietor of the famous Bowmont Stock Farm. With an eye single to the best interests of Roanoke County, Colonel Bowman realized that fortunes awaited the people in the culture of fine fruit. He organized the Diamond Orchard Company, of Salem, of which he is President, and some twelve or thirteen years ago began the planting of the largest orchard of select apples and peaches in the State. This orchard comprises some forty-five thousand trees. Politically Colonel Bowman is a Democrat of the old school. For many years he was a member of the State Democratic Executive Committee, and has been an authorized delegate to every Gubernatorial Convention held by the party since 1873. He was a delegate to the National Democratic Convention which nominated Grover Cleveland for a second term for the presidency in 1888. In the year 1901, Colonel Bowman was called upon to serve the people of Roanoke County, Roanoke City, and Craig County in the Virginia Legislature. Colonel Bowman has been successively reelected biennially since, running at all times ahead of his ticket. At the election held in November, 1909, he was elected without opposition from Roanoke County, the city of Roanoke, and Craig County having been apportioned into separate districts, and was again reölected in 1911. He has at all times held positions on important committees and has done much in the way of shaping the most important legislation of recent years in the State, and as Chairman of the Finance Committee, has served the State with signal ability. For many years he has been President of the Board of Trustees of Roanoke College, and has also been one of the controlling spirits in the Lutheran Orphan Home of Salem, being Vice President of the institution. He is a member and an elder in the College Lutheran Church of Salem, and has been a resident of the town for twenty years. Mr. Bowman has done a great deal for Salem. He was one of the leading spirits in the advancement and material prosperity of the town in 1890, when History of Roanoke County—Salem on the twenty-seventh of January the Salem Development Company was organized with an authorized capital stock of $1,000,000. Colonel Bowman was selected as President of the Company, and it was under his wise management that many improvements of the most substantial kind were inaugurated among which was the construction of two magnificent iron bridges across Roanoke River at a cost of $18,000. This company also put in water works at a cost of nearly $10,000, and constructed some fifty odd dwellings. His company was instrumental in locating a number of important enterprises in the town, and while Salem suffered as all towns in the country suffered in the unparalleled depression which followed in a few years afterwards, the policy adopted by this company was such that to-day Salem is stronger and on a more solid basis than ever before in the town's history. JUDGE WILLIAM WALTER MOFFETT Judge William Walter Moffett, the subject of this sketch, was born July 19th, 1854, in Culpeper County, Virginia, and was the eldest son of John Moffett and Sarah W. Brown, she being the second wife of John Moffett. To this union were born four children—the subject of this sketch, Sallie F., Daniel Anderson, and John R., the last named being the martyr to the cause of temperance and godliness in Virginia, who was stricken by an assassin's bullet while in the discharge of his Christian duties in the city of Danville on the night of November 11th, 1892. The Moffett family came to America some time during the restoration of the Stuarts to the throne of Great Britain. Henry Moffett, who was born in 1705, located in Fauquier County, Virginia. He was the father of the Rev. Anderson Moffett and Daniel Moffett, the latter being the grandfather of the subject of this sketch. For more than fifty years the Rev. Anderson Moffett was pastor of the Smith's Creek Baptist Church, near New Market, Shenandoah County, Virginia. When the Established Church in the Virginia Colony attempted to stamp out what it was pleased to call the heresy of the dissenters, the Rev. Anderson Moffett, with several other Baptist ministers, was thrown into Culpeper jail for preaching the Word of God as the Baptists believe it, and was almost suffocated by the fumes of burning red pepper and sulphur. This member of the family was a true patriot, a faithful preacher, and an earnest and consecrated Christian, and no punishment could deter him from the performance of his duty as he saw it. Daniel Moffett was twice married, his second wife being Miss Mary Newman. He located and lived in Culpeper County on the present homestead of the Moffett family. Three sons were born to this union who reached manhood. They were Walter Newman Moffett, John Moffett, and Horatio Gates Moffett. The first named went to Alabama where, after two years, he was elected a member of the Alabama Legislature. He died at the age of thirty. The other two remained near the old homestead, spending their lives almost wholly in Rappahannock and Culpeper counties. They married sisters, and the families were like a single household. John Moffett was a teacher in the Sunday School at old Gourdvine Church for many years. He died in the year 1867. Judge Moffett was only thirteen years old when his father died, leaving a widow with four children at a dark and gloomy period. But she had a splendid counsellor and adviser in the person of Horatio G. Moffett, who looked after the orphan children of his brother with all the tender care of a parent. Horatio G. Moffett, uncle of Judge Moffett, was for more than twenty-four years Commonwealth's Attorney for Rappahannock County, and for more than half a century was regarded as one of the most thorough and learned lawyers of Piedmont, Virginia. He was a member of the great Secession Convention of Virginia in 1861. Of him the Rev. John R. Moffett once wrote: "He was not only uncle, but father, friend, benefactor. His integrity has ever been our model; his beneficence our blessing. A nobler, stronger, tenderer heart rests not beneath the daisies. The sighs of helpless widows blow softly over his grave, and the flowers are wet with the tears of orphans, who, though mourning him dead, yet rejoice that he lives." Other members of the Moffett family were prominent in the communities in which they lived and have held positions of honor and trust, both as civilians and soldiers. It was from this sturdy stock that the Christian gentleman, the able lawyer, and the just judge, William Walter Moffett, sprang. He was educated at Rappahannock Academy and read law in the office of his uncle, Horatio G. Moffett, at Washington, Virginia. He was admitted to the bar in 1877, and immediately entered the practice of his profession. The following year he established the "Blue Ridge Echo," which he successfully edited for seven years. In 1883 he was elected a member of the Virginia Legislature from Rappahannock County, and took high rank as a law maker. After the completion of his term he moved to Washington, D. C., where for five years he successfully practiced his profession. In 1891 he located in Salem where two years later, on June 19th, 1893, he was appointed to the county judgeship of Roanoke County to fill an unexpired term. The same year he was duly elected to that office, which he held continuously until the abolition of the county court system under the new constitution. In 1906 Judge Moffett was elected by the Legislature to the judgeship of the Twentieth Judicial Circuit of Virginia, comprising the counties of Roanoke, Bedford, Montgomery, and Floyd, and Roanoke City. As a jurist Judge Moffett's opinions are regarded with great favor among the profession. His service on the bench has greatly redounded to his credit. History of Roanoke County—Salem He has served in many important criminal cases and his decisions have ever been regarded as just, although at all times they were tempered with mercy. Judge Moffett was married on February 22d, 1883, to Jessie M. Dudley, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. William T. Dudley, of Rappahannock County, and to their union five children have been born; namely, Willie Gates, married to J. F. Jones, of Rappahannock County; John Daniel, of Baltimore, Maryland; Fannie Dudley, a teacher at the Baptist Orphanage; Sarah A., and Mary Lois. Judge Moffett is a member of the Baptist Church. For many years he has been Chairman of the Executive Board of Trustees of the Baptist Orphanage of Virginia. Politically Judge Moffett is a Democrat of the old school. He is a member of Taylor Lodge of Masons. Judge Moffett has earned, and justly so, the lasting gratitude of the people of his county for the splendid sketches and array of portraits of the citizenship that has made Roanoke County what it is, which adorn the walls of the handsome new courthouse. ORRAN D. OAKEY Orran D. Oakey, the subject of this sketch, is regarded as one of the most successful business men in Salem. He began life as a telegraph operator, but by his indomitable energy, keen business foresight and judgment, and with the full knowledge that there were golden opportunities in the business world, he gave up his position with the Western Union Telegraph Company after five years of service as night chief operator in Lynchburg. Orran D. Oakey, a son of the late William S. and Margaret (Davis) Oakey, was born in Salem, Virginia, October 14th, 1864. As a boy he attended the public schools of Salem and later Roanoke College. He then became a telegrapher, but after five years engaged in the brokerage business in Lynchburg with A. W. Butler &amp; Company, remaining with this firm nearly two years, when he returned to his native town, Salem, where he purchased the hardware business of John Chalmers, which he has successfully conducted ever since under the firm name of the Oakey Hardware Company. This is the oldest hardware concern now in business between Richmond, Virginia, and Knoxville, Tennessee. In the meantime he purchased the plant of the Camden Iron Works, a complete sketch of which will be found elsewhere in this volume, and for the past ten years has been actively engaged in the management of this important enterprise, of which he is the sole owner. A number of years ago he bought the plant of the Salem Wagon Works, for no other reason than to save the enterprise to the town, and which he operated for some time under the name of the Oakey Wagon Company, later selling to E. E. Hughes, of Lynchburg, who continued to run the plant for a period of ten years. During the past year, in conjunction with J. E. Townes, he purchased Hotel Salem, with the view of having the hotel, which had been closed for many months, reopened. In the early 90's, when Salem was "booming," Mr. Oakey was identified with all of the leading land companies, and was a director of the Salem Improvement Company, the Salem Machine Works, and the Holstein Woolen Mills. At present he is a director and a member of the Finance Committee of the Bank of Salem, and is more or less interested in a financial way in all of the enterprises of the town. Fraternally Mr. Oakey is a Mason of high rank, having been District Deputy Grand Master of this district, and for a number of years was Master of Salem Lodge. He is a Knight Templar and a member of Acca Temple A. A. O. K. of M. S.; an Elk, and a member of the United Commercial Travelers. In October, 1887, he married Alice Burch, daughter of James and Elizabeth (Gannaway) Burch, of Lynchburg. To this union four children have been born; namely, Edith E., Glen W., Elizabeth, and Orran D., Jr. COLONEL ROBERT HENRY LOGAN If Roanoke County ever produced a citizen whose life should be a guiding star to the future generations of the county's citizenship, that man was Colonel Robert Henry Logan, the subject of this sketch. As a soldier, a lawyer, a private citizen, a husband and father, a friend to the masses, and as a devotee to the cause of the Master, from his early manhood until called upon to answer the call of his Lord, whom he worshiped, there is no man who can present to the world a nobler or purer record than that of this man who lived and died in Roanoke County. Robert Henry Logan was born in Salem, Virginia, on the tenth day of July, 1839. His parents were Joseph Addison and Elsie (Edmundson) Logan. He was a great grandson of Colonel James Logan, of Rockbridge County, a valiant soldier of the Revolution. He was of distinguished ancestry, being a lineal descendant of Lord Robert Logan, of the Scottish Peerage, who was knighted by King James VI in 1600 for gallantry on the field of battle. His paternal grandfather, Robert Logan, who married Margaret Moore, resided in Botetourt County. His maternal grand History of Roanoke County—Salem father was Major Henry Edmundson, a Virginia soldier of the War of 1812, who resided in Montgomery County, Virginia. It is not to be wondered at that in time of stress, when Virginia needed her bravest and best men at the front, that such as Colonel Logan hastened to answer the call of duty. Robert Henry Logan, as a boy, received his earlier education in the schools of his native town, Salem. He also attended the Montgomery Male Academy at Christiansburg, and for a while attended Roanoke College. While a student there, and when but eighteen years of age, he received an appointment as a cadet at the United States Military Academy at West Point. This was in the year 1857, and he would have graduated in the class of 1861, had it not been for the approaching strife between the states, which caused him to resign his cadetship a few days before his graduation to offer his services to his native state. At the age of twenty-one, on returning to Virginia, he was commissioned a second lieutenant and assigned to duty at an instruction camp near Lynchburg. His military training at West Point for over three years made him a most valuable officer in the training of raw recruits, which were pouring into the camp from every quarter of the State. His natural ability as a soldier and his training soon won for him the lasting respect of the men who, like himself, were ready to do and to die for the cause of their state and of the South. He was not destined long to remain in an instruction camp, having been promoted to the position of Adjutant of the Forty-Second Regiment, Virginia Infantry. In December, 1861, he was again promoted, this time to the staff of General John C. Floyd, with the rank of first lieutenant. He followed the fortunes of General Floyd through West Virginia and Kentucky, and at Fort Donelson was in command of an artillery company when his horse was shot under him. In the following year, 1862, he was attached to the Twenty-Seventh Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, under the command of his uncle, Colonel Henry A. Edmundson, and was given charge of a battery of light artillery. His services as commander of this battery were of the highest character. At Shelbyville he repulsed an entire regiment of cavalry after all support had been withdrawn from his battery. His activities extended into Tennessee, where he served with Generals Wheeler, Forrest, and Hardee, and while in Kentucky served under Marshall and Bragg. All of these well-known generals of the Confederate Army recommended him for promotion for gallantry and valuable services. A promotion to the rank of captain carried with it a transfer to Virginia, where he served on the staff of General G. C. Wharton and engaged in the campaign around Washington and against Sheridan in the Valley of Virginia. In these campaigns he so distinguished himself that he was promoted to the position of lieutenant colonel, and placed in command of the Forty-Fifth Regiment, Virginia Infantry, which command he filled with distinction and credit until the regiment was disbanded on April 13th, 1865. He was wounded in three engagements, and captured once, but managed to escape, and had three horses shot under him, one at Fort Donelson and two at Winchester. At the end of the war, Colonel Logan, like thousands of young men, returned to a desolated home and fireside. He was without funds and without a profession, but he was just as brave to take up the battle of life in rebuilding the lost fortunes of the war in his native county as he was in volunteering to enter the service of his beloved state. Unlike many brave Virginians, who sought their fortunes in the West, he went into the woods with his axe, where he hewed tie lumber which he sold to the railroad, in this way earning enough money to equip himself for the study of law. In 1867, two years later, he was admitted to the bar, and thus began a professional career which was continued with honor and success until the time of his death. His diligence, his honesty, his high moral purpose, and his absolute fearlessness soon inspired in him a confidence which gained for him a clientele that made him independent. Twice Colonel Logan was elected Mayor of Salem, and for twenty years was town attorney. He was prevailed upon once to enter politics, when he was elected to the Virginia Legislature to represent Roanoke County for the term of 1893-94. On December 21st, 1871, Colonel Logan married his second cousin, Anna Clayton Logan, daughter of James W. and Sarah (Strother) Logan, natives of Culpeper and Goochland counties, respectively. Her paternal grandfather was the Rev. Joseph D. Logan, a widely known Virginia Presbyterian minister. To this union were born five children, as follows: Mary L., who married Professor Paul C. Nugent, of Syracuse University, New York; Elsie A., who married Joseph Clayton Logan, of Atlanta, Georgia; Sarah S., who married S. R. Mallory Kenedy, of New Orleans, Louisiana; John Lee, an attorney at law, who located in Norfolk, Virginia, and died there February 19th, 1906; and Philip Clayton, who was drowned while bathing in Roanoke River near Salem, in 1893. A biographer in writing of this says: "Colonel Logan's diary reveals a lasting grief which his most intimate friends did not comprehend. The diary of an honest man reveals his inmost self as nothing else can do. Often does Colonel Logan, in his diary, say: `This is the — day, or — week, or — year since my little boy was taken. God give me strength to bear it.' " On December 26th, 1900, Colonel Logan died at his home in Salem, aged sixty-one years, five months and sixteen days. He was Commander of Hupp-Deyerle Camp of Confederate Veterans, and the organization attended his funeral in a body. A beautiful tribute was paid the distinguished dead by the camp and has been made a matter of record. His memory is also cherished in resolutions adopted by the vestry of St. Paul's Protestant Episcopal Church in Salem, Virginia, of which he was senior warden. The State Bar Association adopted a splendid tribute to his many noble qualifications and his service to the public, which was prepared and read by Honorable J. Allen Watts, now deceased. Among other cherished opinions of this splendid man may be mentioned those from Judge Archer A. Phlegar and Honorable Peter J. Otey, both lifelong friends of Colonel Logan.

History of Roanoke County—Salem THOMAS HENRY COOPER The subject of this sketch, Thomas Henry Cooper, was born at Locust Gap, Pennsylvania, July 1st, 1869, and died at Salem, Virginia, March 23d, 1911. He was a son of the late John Cooper and Maria (Padbury) Cooper, both natives of Dudley, England. John Cooper was born November 14th, 1842, and Maria (Padbury) Cooper, December 10th, 1845.

Vest, Town Sergeant. For a number of years Mr. Vest was employed as a telegrapher by the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company, and the manner in which he performed his duties won for him the esteem of his associates and the confidence of the management. In the June election he was the candidate for the office of Town Sergeant in opposition to Mr. E. R. Moore. It was an active campaign and both candidates had many friends. Mr. Vest, however, was the winner, receiving a substantial majority. Since entering upon the discharge of his duties, Mr. Vest has proven himself a most capable officer, a man who knows how to exercise discrimination and judgment, and who is at all times fearless. His father before him had the reputation of being a man of bravery, and from him the son inherited the courage that has brought him to the front in the maintenance of law and order in Salem. The position of Town Sergeant is not an easy one to fill by any means, for its duties are manifold and of the most important character. Mr. Vest has met every problem with intelligence and skill, and has given his administration attention that has been highly satisfactory to his constituents. The people of his town have utmost confidence in him and predict that his term of service will be creditable and honorable to him. Mr. Vest has a wife and several children, and they make their home in Salem, where they have many friends. He is a member of the Baptist Church.

In mingling with his fellow men, Mr. Vest has a pleasant word for all with whom he comes in contact. Pleasant in manner, kind and thoughtful in his bearing towards others, and an officer of ability, he has won a prominent place in his community and has a well wisher in every citizen.

(McDermed) Stearnes, was born at Dublin, Pulaski County, Virginia, December 17th, 1863. He was prepared for college at Wysorton High School by Professor George W. Walker. He was prescription clerk from 1878 to 1881 for Darst and Stearnes, druggists, at Dublin, Virginia. He entered Richmond (Virginia) College in 1881, where he graduated as Bachelor of Arts in 1884, and as Master of Arts in 1886. It was his habit and pleasure as a boy to spend a portion of each year at the home of his uncle, Dr. J. B. Baskerville, in Big Lick. "Some of the happiest hours of my boyhood," he recently said, "were spent fishing for minnows and eels in Trout Run,"—where the business center of Roanoke now is. While he was at college, the village of Big Lick grew to be the city of Roanoke, and upon graduation Mr. Stearnes decided to cast his lot with this growing young city. He was chosen as the first Superintendent of the newly established Alleghany Institute at Rorer Park. For three years, from 1886 to 1889, he successfully conducted this school of high grade, where many of those who are now among the prominent professional and business men of Roanoke were educated. Early in 1890 he moved to Salem, and has since been prominently identified with the business interests History of Roanoke County—Salem of Salem and Roanoke County. In the spring of that year he organized the Salem Development Company, of which he was vice president. Upon these lands the town of South Salem is now located. He also organized the Salem Club Land Company and the Creston Land Company, of Salem, of both of which companies he was president. Other Salem enterprises which he organized, and of which he was a director, were the Salem Loan and Trust Company, the Conrad Chair and Manufacturing Company, and the Crystal Ice Company. Mr. Stearnes was chairman of the committee of his church that secured, after a spirited contest in 1891, the location of the Baptist Orphanage of Virginia at Salem. He is a member of the Board of Trustees of this institution, and Secretary of its Executive Committee. In 1900 Mr. Stearnes was appointed by Governor Tyler a member of the Board of Trustees of the State Female Normal School at Farmville, succeeding Judge Hundley, of Amelia County. He took an active part in the reorganization of this school in the following year, the result being that it became one of the recognized normal schools of the country. Upon the resignation of Dr. Robert Frazer as president of the Normal School in 1901, Mr. Stearnes resigned from the Board in order to apply for the vacancy. In the election that followed there was a tie vote between him and President Jarman, until the deadlock was broken by the election of the latter. From 1905 to 1910 Mr. Stearnes had general charge of the business of the B. F. Johnson Publishing Company as their western agent in the four Southern States west of the Mississippi River. Since 1910, as in the decade prior to 1905, with offices in Salem and Roanoke, he has conducted the business of promoting the development of the mineral, timber, industrial, and water power resources of Southwest Virginia. Mr. Stearnes is the promoter of the extensive water power developments now going on along New River in Pulaski, Carroll, and other counties in Southwest Virginia. He was one of the managers of the New River Project Syndicate, which organized the New River Power Company, which, having purchased the lands and water rights for half a dozen or more hydro-electric developments along New River, and a dozen electric light and power plants in Southwest Virginia and Southern West Virginia, sold them to the present Appalachian Power Company, which is controlled and operated by Messrs. H. M. Byllesby &amp; Co., of Chicago. Mr. Stearnes is an ardent Democrat. As the local Chairman and member of his County Committee, as a member of the Democratic State Committee, and Chairman of the Sixth District Committee, as President of various campaign clubs, and delegate to district and State Democratic Conventions for twenty years past, he has given freely of his time and money to the cause of his party. On February 10th. 1892, he married Miss Margaret Buchanan, of Greenbrier County, West Virginia. They have two children, Misses Constance and Margaret Lewis Stearnes, the former now a student at Hollins College. HISTORY OF VINTON Set like a jewel in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the town of Vinton, noted as a place for homes for workingmen, may be regarded as a center for the great middle class of Roanoke County's population. The people are frugal, honest, law-abiding, generous, and well to do. Not wealthy, nor are they poor, as the term implies. They are a working people, and considering the population, it is highly probable that more people own the homes in which they live, than in any town of like size in Southwest Virginia. Next to Salem, Vinton is the most important center of population in the county, the city of Roanoke excepted. During the twenty-eight years of Vinton's existence there has not been a murder committed within its borders, so far as could be determined, and cases of disorder are exceedingly rare. About a year ago, a young man was found dead in the corporate limits, and foul play was indicated, but the circumstances led the authorities to believe that his murder emanated from Roanoke. Vinton is preöminently a church-going town—the Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, and Lutheran denominations having good congregations and comfortable houses of worship. The colored population of the town have two good churches. The town has one of the best graded schools in the country, the sessions lasting nine months in the year. The school buildings are commodious and well equipped. The town has strong Odd Fellows and Masonic lodges. The town is well lighted by electricity and many of the best homes are lighted in the same way. The principal streets have been laid with water mains by the Vinton-Roanoke Water Company and the homes and business houses are supplied with an excellent freestone water from the mountain reservoir five miles away. There are a large number of mercantile houses of every description, including dry goods stores, drug store, and general merchandise establishments. The town is connected with Roanoke by trolley line with a fifteen minutes' schedule from six a. m. to midnight, making the place as convenient to the great markets and stores of Roanoke as they are to half the population of that city. Vinton has an excellent telephone exchange, a bank established last year, a large flouring mill, and an enameling and stamping corporation operates its plant in the town. The Virginia Iron, Coal and Coke Company's furnaces, the Virginia Bridge and Iron Company, and the Roanoke Machine Works, are as accessible and as near to the people of Vinton as to a large part of Roanoke's population, and hundreds of men residing in Vinton are employed in these various industrial institutions. Many business men doing business in Roanoke reside in Vinton. Early History of Vinton Gish's Mills, Gish's Mill, Gish's, and Vinton, are the successive names by which the place has been known. Three-quarters of a century ago, the first name was applied, for the reason that the waters of Glade Creek turned two mills owned by David Gish and his brother. Later, when one of the mills, either by misuse or destruction, gave way to the other, the plural name was dropped and "Gish's Mill" was substituted. After the completion of the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad, and I. W. Vinyard had become the owner of David Gish's mill, the place was made a flag stop and was called Gish's. Before the Civil War, William Gish operated a store near the flag stop, where a box car served as a depot. William Gish was the father of Griffin Gish and the late George McHenry Gish. When the war broke out the Gish brothers joined the Confederacy and George McH. Gish, on the death of Captain Deyerle, was promoted to the rank of Captain of the "Roanoke Grays" (See Military History of County). In April, 1865, after Lee's surrender, Stoneman's Cavalry burned the makeshift of a depot. The war over, Captain Gish and his brother, Griffin Gish, returned to Vinton and engaged in mercantile pursuits. Captain George McH. Gish, after several years, succeeded in inducing General William Mahone, then President of the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad, to build a depot at Gish's. At that time, only a few families lived in the place, notably, those of I. White Vinyard, John C. Fox, and the Gish brothers. The post office was in the residence of John C. Fox and was kept by his daughter, Miss Jennie Fox, afterwards the wife of Dr. George T. Walker, both now deceased. In and near the place were a large number of the Vinyard family. The land on which the town now stands was largely owned by the Vinyards and Gishes. In the course of time, others came and settled around the little way station, among them being the Funks, Pollards, Pedigos, B. A. Jones, Dr. Walker, Daniel McLean, W. Colin Bass, Allen Jones, and others. There was an overwhelming desire on the part of Captain Gish to build a town here. He had given the land on which to build the depot and also the land to open up Washington Street from the depot eastward. The lands for the original town site were laid off into building lots and about the year 1878, an auction sale was held, and the lots sold off to the highest History of Roanoke County—Vinton bidders. A number of houses were built, and in the mean time a substantial schoolhouse was erected. One of the most important enterprises was a tannery, operated by John W. and Edward M. Jones. Fine leather was made from which boots and shoes for the inhabitants and harness for the farmers were made. In the winter of 1884, a mass meeting was called in the schoolhouse to consider the question of incorporating the place. Roanoke City had just been chartered. The building of the shops and Crozer Furnaces in Roanoke had caused an influx of population in the little town. In other words it was on a "boom." A change of name was proposed, and at the meeting several names were suggested. B. A. Jones suggested "Vinton." It was a pretty sounding name, and at once met with favor. The name was adopted and no time was lost in the incorporation of the town. Vinton sprang into existence on March 17th, 1884. The act of the General Assembly incorporating the town, is as follows: "An Act to change the name of the town of Gish's, in the County of Roanoke, to Vinton, and to incorporate the same." 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of Virginia, That the town of Gish's, in the county of Roanoke, as the same heretofore has been or may hereafter be laid off into lots, streets, and alleys, shall be made a town corporate by the name of the town of Vinton, and by that name shall have and exercise the power conferred upon towns by the fifty-fourth chapter of the Code of Virginia of 1873, and of all laws now in force or that hereafter may be enacted for the government of towns of less than five thousand inhabitants. 2. The boundaries of said town shall be: Commencing at the crossing of First Street and Washington Street, in said town, and extending there from one-half mile north, south, east, and west, and embracing the area contained therein. 3. All lands contained in this area, and used strictly for farming purposes, shall not be liable to taxation under this corporate law. 4. Samuel H. Pollard is hereby appointed Mayor of said town, and B. A. Jones, R. S. Funk, I. W. Vinyard, Geo. T. Walker, John McFalls, and P. B. Stevens are hereby appointed Councilmen thereof—any three of whom shall constitute a quorum, for the transaction of business. The said Mayor and Council shall have power to levy such taxes as they may deem necessary for the purpose of said corporation, as is allowed by existing laws; provided that no tax upon the real and personal property in said corporation shall exceed ten cents on the $100 value thereof, except that on petition of three-fourths of the freeholders in the corporation the Council may levy a tax not to exceed the amount named in the said petition, and they shall have power to appoint a Sergeant and such other officers as may be necessary and fix their salaries. 5. The said Mayor and Councilmen above named and appointed in this act shall remain in office until the first day of July, 1885, and thereafter until their successors shall be elected and qualified according to law—the term of which shall be two years, and no person shall be eligible to be a member of this Council, except he be a freeholder. 6. This act shall be in force from its passage. From that time on Vinton continued to grow. The town began to build westward and coeval with the "boom" of Roanoke came the "boom" of Vinton. Some sixteen acres of land were purchased by W. A. and B. B. Pedigo, laid off into lots, streets, and alleys, and known as the Pedigo Addition. This was the first land company. Quickly following was the Vinton Land, Loan and Building Company, capitalized largely by farmers and the people of Vinton, the Ætna Land Company, the Glade Land Company, the Midway Land Company, and others. Large boundaries, including hundreds of acres where wheat and corn had heretofore grown were thrown open as grazing lands. The real estate agents came and during the years of 1888, '89 and '90 the sound of the hammer and saw was heard on all hands. Men quit their trades and professions and began speculating in Vinton realty. Lots were exorbitantly high. Comfortable fortunes were made and lost in the course of a few months. The "boom" in Vinton collapsed with the "boom" in Roanoke. The man who had bought a home, and was lucky enough to retain his position, or return to his old place in the shops, was enabled to pay for it, and many excellent properties were sold to workingmen away under their original cost. Many workingmen bought these homes, and have long since paid for them and are now living in easy circumstances. In 1890 the "dummy" line was completed to Vinton giving half hour trips to Roanoke. This had a tendency to greatly inflate the values of Vinton lots. Many Roanoke speculators found the place easy of access and spent their money freely, making first payments, with the hope of unloading at a profit. Such were the conditions in Vinton in the early nineties. Giles Gunn, one of the Mayors of Vinton had purchased the old Obenchain residence occupied for many years by Mrs. Peggy Vinyard, and converted it into the most magnificent home of the town called the "Gunnery." On a commanding eminence to the southeast lived M. P. Preston, one of the pioneers of Vinton. His son-in-law, the Rev. William Lunsford, then a practicing attorney prepared the original charter for the incorporation of the town. A prominent figure in the history of Vinton, as well as of the early days of Big Lick, was the late Alexander McD. Smith. He formerly owned the Ætna and Glade Land Company properties, two of the most important additions to the town. Vinton soon outgrew its original boundaries, and History of Roanoke County—Vinton it was deemed advisable to extend the corporate limits so as to include all the improvement companies which had been organized. Accordingly an act was passed by the General Assembly of Virginia on March 4th, 1890, reönacting section two of the Act of Incorporation approved March 17th, 1884, in which the boundary lines were extended, and as they remain to-day. The boundaries were specified as follows: "Beginning on the northwest line of said town at two sassafras trees by the road through I. W. Vinyard's land, which is at present the corporate line of said town; thence westerly a straight line to the corner of I. W. Vinyard's and Midway Land Company's lands; thence with the northern boundary of said company's lands and through the lands of the Roanoke Land and Improvement Company a straight line to the center of Tinker Creek, a little distance above the Crozer Furnace; thence with the center of the said creek south, southeast, and east to where a large branch comes into said creek from the lands of the Glade Land Company; thence following said branch northeast to the line of N. J. Vinyard's land; thence with said Vinyard's line to the summit of the hill near an old house; thence across a corner of said Vinyard's land (a new line) till the straight line strikes said Vinyard's line again, and continuing along said Vinyard's line till it strikes the Pedigo Addition to the town of Vinton; thence with the line of said addition and including the same, to a corner of the lands of Pedigo and Preston, near the brick yard; thence a straight line to the mouth of Preston's lane, on the Bedford Road; thence a straight line to the corner of Routt's land at the mouth of Ruddell's land; thence northwest with said road to its intersection with the Bonsack Road; thence a straight line to the beginning." It was provided further that the lands included in these boundaries should be exempt from any county levies, other than a pro rata part of the taxation for the payment of a subscription of $200,000 made by the county of Roanoke to the Valley Railroad Company. In 1889, John C. Hill and W. L. Patterson established the Vinton Dispatch, a weekly newspaper, which was sold to George S. Jack in 1890, who continued its publication for nearly two years. In the course of time "boom" conditions adjusted themselves. Fictitious values gave way to real values, and the town has steadily progressed in population and importance. For many years, the Methodists were the only denomination having a place of worship. Next the Lutheran congregation built a church, and in the course of a few years, the Baptists and Presbyterians had built handsome and centrally located houses of worship. New Charter Granted On March 12th, 1904, an act was passed by the General Assembly providing a new charter for the town of Vinton, which repealed all other acts inconsistent with same. The administration and government was vested in a mayor and council, the latter composed of six members, a treasurer and town sergeant. All persons in office were to continue in office until the first day of September, succeeding the first election held. The election for mayor and councilmen was to be held the second Tuesday in June and every second year thereafter, and all officers so elected must enter upon the duties of their respective offices, the first day of September succeeding their election. The council elects the treasurer and sergeant and they serve two years. The new charter provided that a head tax not exceeding fifty cents could be levied on all male inhabitants of the town over twenty-one years of age, and a property levy not exceeding twenty-five cents on the $100 of valuation could be assessed by the town council for municipal purposes. Under the new charter these provisions remained in force until 1911, when by a freehold vote the tax levy was increased to fifty cents on the $100 of valuation. This increase carried by one majority and was so ordered by the court. The doubling of the assessment was demanded in order to raise sufficient revenue for the maintenance of the lighting system recently installed and for street improvements. And such is the town of Vinton at the beginning of 1912. Mayors of the Town The following citizens in the order in which their names appear have served as Mayors of Vinton: Sam'1 H. Pollard, George T. Walker, Henry Franklin, Giles Gunn, W. S. Pollard, J. E. Saunders, Henry H. Walker, J. H. Scott, incumbent. Biographical GEORGE THOMAS WALKER No man in Vinton did more for the general upbuild-ing of the town for more than three decades than did the late Dr. George Thomas Walker.

JAMES WILLIAM BOWIE James William Bowie was born in Rappahannock County, Virginia, November 18th, 1862, being a son of William Jackson and Henrietta (White) Bowie. When a boy he attended the country schools in Rappahannock County. In 1881 he removed to Roanoke County where he was employed in the commercial milling business by William P. Huff near Hollins. Later he became identified with the Catawba Mills near Fincastle. After three years he returned to the mill of William P. Huff, and in 1889 became the Manager of the P. L.

S. McGhee, druggist, and remained with him for four years. January 1st, 1910, Mr. Fitzpatrick purchased the Vinton drug store from Newton V. Woolfolk, and has established a business which is indeed gratifying. He carries, at all times, a full and complete line of pure fresh drugs, chemicals, paints, oils, toilet articles, and stationery, and makes a specialty of the prescription department, where all prescriptions are accurately and carefully compounded. Mr. Fitzpatrick is a loyal citizen of Vinton, and during his residence in that city, has made hosts of warm personal friends. GEORGE WILLIAM GISH George William Gish, the subject of this sketch, is now one of Vinton's prominent citizens. He was born in Roanoke County, October 26th, 1865, his parents being George R. and Mary A. (Thrasher) Gish. When a boy he attended the county schools, the Alleghany Institute in Roanoke, and took a course at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Blacksburg, Virginia. He resided on his father's farm, east of Vinton until he was twenty-two years old. Later he removed to Vinton, where he has for many years successfully conducted a coal and wood business, building up a most lucrative trade. He is also engaged in the business of farming, and is a large History of Roanoke County—Vinton owner of Vinton realty. Besides looking after his private interests he devotes much of his time to the public welfare. He is Clerk of the School Board for Big Lick District and as such has been active in the promotion of the educational interests of the county. He is also Road Supervisor for Big Lick District. On April 10th, 1889, he married Lena R. Cook, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. George W. Cook of Bonsack. To them one child, George Robert Gish, now aged seventeen years, was born. Mrs. Lena R. Gish died February 7th, 1905. On November 27th, 1907, George William Gish married Lillie H. Fuqua, daughter of Dr. and Mrs. J. W. Fuqua, and one daughter Lillian Alpha, aged two years, has been born to this union. Mr. Gish is a member of one of the most prominent of Roanoke County's families, and as a citizen of Vinton and the county, he has at all times stood for any movement which had for its object the uplift of the moral, religious, or educational development of his community. WILLIAM FOUNTAIN GRAVES William Fountain Graves, the subject of this sketch, was born in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, September 29th, 1832, and is a son of the late Mr. and Mrs. Peyton Graves. He removed to Bedford County at the age of twelve, which was a few years after his father's death, and was educated in the public schools of his adopted county. Mr. Graves was engaged in farming when the Civil War broke out and he was one among the first in his county to offer his services to his state and the Confederacy. He enlisted as a Sergeant in Company F, Second Virginia Cavalry and entered the service May 27th, 1861. In August, of the same year he was made a Lieutenant of his company and still later in the same month was elected Captain. When his regiment was reorganized in 1862 he was again elected Captain and was the only man holding a similar office in his regiment, who was reölected. He was afterwards promoted and received the title of Major and just before the end of that great struggle, was made a Lieutenant Colonel of the regiment. Colonel Graves participated in a number of engagements, was twice wounded and his dash and bravery are known to many of the men in this section of Virginia, who fought for the lost cause. He is the highest ranking officer now living in either Roanoke or Bedford counties and he takes an active interest in the affairs of the old soldiers. At the close of the war Colonel Graves returned to Bedford County and engaged in farming and milling for many years. In 1871 he was elected to the House of Delegates from Bedford County and served his people for five consecutive terms. He was not only an able law maker, but was regarded as the best parliamentarian in the House. Colonel Graves came to Vinton in 1904 and served one term as Mayor and is now Deputy Sheriff of Roanoke County. In 1858 he was married to Miss Mary J. Johnson, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Frank Johnson of Bedford County and they have eleven children, all of whom are living. The children are as follows: John T., Mary Willie, Francis P., Nannie L., Joseph P., Minnie J., Alice O., Stuart, Nunie C., Florence O., and Oscar Graves. He has thirty-four grandchildren living. Colonel Graves is a member of Lakeland Lodge of Masons and religiously is a Baptist. CHARLES C. THOMAS The gentleman whose name captions this article has done as much perhaps as any other one individual for the general upbuilding and advancement of Vinton along industrial and commercial lines. Mr. Charles C. Thomas was born at Jackson, Mississippi, in February, 1859, and is a son of the late Mr. and Mrs. Joseph A. Thomas, both natives of Cumberland County, Virginia. When a mere infant he was brought back to this state and the family located in Roanoke County. Mr. Thomas was educated at Milligan College in Tennessee, and in 1887 was united in marriage to Miss Ella Coffman of Botetourt County. As a result of that happy union, eleven children have been born to them. Mr. Thomas came to Roanoke in 1889 and for five years was associated with the Roanoke Railway and Electric Company. He moved to Vinton in 1896 and now resides at the old Preston homestead, one of the most beautiful in Roanoke County. Mr. Thomas was the organizer and is the President of the Peoples Bank of Vinton, a sound financial institution that enjoys a splendid patronage and is of great convenience to the people of that municipality as well as a large territory contiguous. He is a director of the Vinton Land and Improvement Company, and is interested in various other enterprises which have for their object the upbuilding of Vinton, Roanoke City, and Roanoke County. Mr. Thomas is a wide-awake, progressive citizen, and a firm believer in the future greatness of Vinton and Roanoke County. During the past fifteen years he has been engaged in the real estate business in Roanoke City and is the senior member of the firm of Thomas &amp; Upson with well appointed offices at 313 Jefferson Street. He is a member of Mount Herman Lodge No. 95, I. O. O. F. of Vinton, a charter member of the Christian Church of Roanoke, and now an elder of same. Mr. Thomas is a christian gentleman whom it is a pleasure to know, and his friends are legion in this city and section. History of Roanoke County—Vinton DANIEL LUTHER MEADOR D. L. Meador, is engaged in the general merchandise business at Vinton, Virginia, and is one of the town's most progressive, wide-awake citizens. He was born in Bedford County, Virginia, November 25th, 1869, and is a son of Mr. and Mrs. R. W. Meador. His education was acquired in the public schools of his native county and he came to Vinton about fifteen years ago and since that time has been actively engaged in mercantile pursuits. He conducts a general merchandise store, which is located on the corner of First and Lee streets and the handsome building occupied would do credit to a much larger town than Vinton. Fair, honest dealing has always been his motto in business and his success in life is largely attributed to this fact alone. Four years ago Mr. Meador was united in marriage to Miss Rose K. Richardson, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. D. P. Richardson, and as a result of that union they have a little son, David Golden, two and one-half years old. Mr. Meador is a member of the Blue Ridge Baptist Church, one of the oldest in Roanoke County, and is a loyal citizen of Vinton, always alive to the best interests of the community and has aided in every possible manner in the upbuilding of that town. JAMES EDWARD SAUNDERS James Edward Saunders was born in Bedford County, Virginia, November 10th, 1856, his parents being James Cunningham and Mary (Halley) Saunders. When a boy he attended the schools of Bedford County, and the Sunnyside High School of which Professor Alex. Eubank was the Principal. During the vacation period he worked on his father's farm. When quite a young man he went to Illinois where he taught school for two years. For a period of eight years he taught in the schools of Bedford County and the Middle West. In 1891 he located in Vinton where for a year or more he engaged in mercantile pursuits. He afterwards sold his business and accepted a position with the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway in the Roanoke shops, where he has been constantly for seventeen years. For a period of eighteen months he was Postmaster at Vinton, which position he resigned about a year ago. At the age of twenty-one years he married Virginia Pocahontas, daughter of Mercer and Anne J. Gray of Bedford County, Virginia. One daughter was born to this union, Mary W., who married the Rev. M. W. Royall and resides with her husband at Pearisburg, Virginia, where Mr. Royall is Pastor of the Baptist Church. Mrs. Saunders died in Vinton May 22d, 1911. Mr. Saunders is one of the town's progressive and popular citizens, and has at all times been deeply interested in the town's prosperity. He served one term and a portion of another as Mayor. JOHN TIMOTHY LEMON John Timothy Lemon, a leading merchant and business man of Vinton, was born in Botetourt County, January 24th, 1860, and is a son of Mr. and Mrs. William B. Lemon of Troutville, Virginia. He came to Vinton from Botetourt in 1889 and for two years was engaged in the business of contract plastering, after which he embarked in the mercantile business, and for a number of years conducted one of the leading merchandise stores of the town. He afterwards located in Roanoke where he became identified with the wholesale produce firm of A. G. Chewning &amp; Company, and was with this concern for a period of seven and one-half years. Nearly five years ago he again located in Vinton, where he is now conducting two large mercantile establishments on the opposite corners of Lee and Second streets. One concern is devoted exclusively to the handling of groceries, and the other, in the new building of the Vinton Improvement Company, to dry goods, notions, and shoes. These stores are modern in their appointments and the large and comprehensive stocks carried would do credit to a town several times the size of Vinton. Mr. Lemon has been successful in business, is a director in the Vinton Investment Company, and is an extensive owner of Vinton realty. In 1879 he was married to Miss Bettie B. Zimmerman, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Jacob Zimmerman of Roanoke County. Fraternally he is a Mason and an Odd Fellow, holding his membership in the Vinton Lodges of the two orders. He is a member of the Vinton Baptist Church. HISTORY OF BENT MOUNTAIN Just when or where the first settler pitched his tent, or built his rude log cabin within the confines of Roanoke County is indeterminate, there being no record left of such achievement. There is a well authenticated tradition, however, which leads the historian to believe that the foot hills of the Bent Mountain were occupied by white men even before any settlers' cabins were reared in the more fertile Roanoke and Catawba valleys. The First Settlers James L. Heckman, an aged citizen of Franklin County who is still living, relates an account of the coming of the first settlers to this section which was told him in childhood by his grandfather, and afterwards repeated to him by his father, to the effect that four men came into this vicinity from Pennsylvania on a hunting and trapping expedition. They were Heckman, Willett, Martin, and Webster. With nothing but their guns, ammunition, carving knives, and frying pans they passed down the Valley of Virginia following the path of the "Great Trail," as mentioned elsewhere in this volume, leaving civilization in their wake, in quest of game. There is a tradition to the effect that Samuel Billups had preceded the quartet named by a short period. He was a brother-in-law of Henry Webster. Crossing Roanoke River, the stream then being unnamed, and seeing the Blue Mountains looming up in the distance, they made their way southwestward, until they came to a stream flowing to the east, and which the reader has already guessed to be Back Creek. In this veritable wilderness, the hardy huntsmen found game to be plentiful, and with a salubrious climate, the fertile bottom lands of Back Creek furnished an ideal spot for a settlement. Returning to Pennsylvania for their families, a second trip was made over the same route by the four venturesome pioneers. After leaving the Roanoke River, Heckman went further to the southward and reared his cabin at the foot of CaHay's Knob in Franklin County. The other three followed the course of Back Creek, and formed the first Bent Mountain settlement. Willett, believed to have been David Willett, took up his abode at the forks of the creek where the Ferguson school house now stands. Webster and Martin pushed further up the right-hand fork of the creek, and Webster built his cabin on the site now occupied as a home by the widow of the late Thomas Webster, while a short distance further up Martin settled, his cabin being located on the site now occupied by Alvin Martin, one of his descendants. It is believed, though no permanent records of the settlement can be found, that the coming of this trio to this section was soon after 1740. The names of these first settlers have all been perpetuated in their numerous descendants, who still reside in this section of Roanoke County, many of whom are more prominently mentioned in the succeeding pages. With the advent of these first settlers, others came until in time the fertile creek valleys were dotted over with cabins. It was not until 1861 that anything transpired to bring these early settlers prominently before the public. The tocsins of Civil War being sounded, many of them as shown by the rosters of the various military companies formed in Roanoke and Montgomery counties, responded to their country's call, and as valiant soldiers as fought through that bloody struggle responded from the Back Creek and Bent Mountain sections. First House on the Mountain It was not until years after the first cabins were built on the creeks below, that Bent Mountain, or that part of Roanoke County comprised in the Plateau of Virginia, was settled. The records show that a large boundary of land, comprising some twenty odd thousand acres, descended to Colonel Andrew Lewis of Montgomery LONGWOOD—FIRST HOUSE BUILT ON BENT MOUNTAIN County. He was the fourth son of General Andrew Lewis, and he built what is reputed to be the first house on top of the mountain. It was called "Longwood," a more minute sketch being given in the succeeding pages. The immense territory comprised in the Lewis grants embodied about eight thousand acres of land on top of the mountain and extended back almost to the Floyd line, while a great portion of it was mountain land and comprised the famous Back Creek pippin apple section of to-day. History of Roanoke County—Bent Mountain The Coles Purchase As the years passed away, the great Lewis Tract was divided and most of the original boundary passed out of the hands of the first owner or his immediate descendants. A man named Clark became the owner of most of the mountain land and of a large boundary of the plateau land on top of the mountain. This he afterwards sold to John M. Price of Fincastle, who in turn sold to John Coles, a boundary of twelve thousand acres, more or less, which proved to be nearer fourteen thousand acres, for the sum of $12,000.00. Some six PICKING APPLES ON BENT MOUNTAIN or eight thousand acres of the original Lewis Tract, near the Floyd County line, was purchased many years ago by Tazewell and Warfield Price. In the years to come as this section became more thickly populated, these vast boundaries were subdivided into smaller farms, with the exception of one large tract of nearly five thousand acres which was purchased by the late Captain Joseph Motley Terry, and which at his death reverted to J. Coles Terry, his son, all of which the latter still owns. On this beautiful plateau are now some of the best homes in Roanoke County, and some of the most productive, as well as the largest apple orchards of this section of Virginia. Bent Mountain in Civil War When the Civil War broke out, the Bent Mountain and Back Creek sections of Roanoke County furnished their full quota of troops, and no braver or truer men went from any section of the South than those who enlisted under the banner of the Confederacy from the Bent Mountain. Among them were the Willetts, the Fergusons, Joe Baldwin, Squire King, John Coles, Captain Joseph M. Terry, J. Coles Terry and others. The soldiers from this section were members of the various companies from Roanoke and Montgomery counties. In 1863, John R. Peyton, a recruiting officer for the Confederacy, was shot and killed by E. T. Stover, a refugee, on the Bent Mountain Road, near the Mays' place. Stover was afterwards arrested, tried at Salem for murder, convicted and executed. When on April 9th, 1865, on Virginia soil the curtain fell upon the last act in that stupendous drama, which had enchained the attention of civilized humanity for four years, Virginia was a scene of indescribable desolation and the condition of her people pitiable beyond description; yet when the conflict was over, the brave mountaineers returned to this section, and inspired by the same manly courage which had caused them to follow the fortunes of Lee and Jackson, they began life anew, with the distinct purpose in view of rebuilding what had perished by their absence, while fighting for the cause they loved so well. First Orchard Planting But little of value from an historical point of view occurred in this favored section for several years after the close of the war, then an event occurred which has had a wonderfully transforming effect on this mountain country. Jordan Woodrum, then about the meridian of life, bought a large tract of land on Bent Mountain. Heavily timbered, and almost a wilderness, it was thought by many of little value. There L. C. SHOCKEY'S ORCHARD were no improvements save an humble log hut, with only a small patch cleared in this "vast wilderness." In this mountain fastness Mr. Woodrum saw great possibilities, and under the guidance of his masterly intellect, and by the work of his hands, this wilderness, in a few short years was made "to blossom like the rose," and to-day, one of the best fruit farms in all Virginia, attest his judgment and is a speaking monument to the genius of one of Roanoke County's foremost citizens. History of Roanoke County—Bent Mountain His great good judgment in locating, clearing, and planting this mountain farm with thousands of pippin apple trees, and his wonderful success, gave an impetus to fruit growing in Roanoke County, that has been the means of bringing hundreds of thousands of dollars APPLE SHOW, ROANOKE, VIRGINIA into this section, with the prospect in a few years, of increasing it to millions. He may be, and justly so, regarded as the pioneer of the great feature of industry that is destined to make Roanoke County one of the wealthiest in Virginia. This orchard is partly owned by John S. Woodrum, and a single crop has brought as high as $15,000.00, an average yield of $600.00 per acre. The highest yield ever recorded was from a boundary embracing two-thirds of an acre, containing twenty trees. Two years ago, the apples from these trees were sold for $750.00, the yield being at the rate of $1,125.00 per acre. PICKING APPLES—WOODRUM ORCHARD Apples from this orchard have always commanded fancy prices, and their sale has not been confined to this country alone, but large shipments have been made to European markets. Of the original orchard planted by Jordan Woodrum one-fourth is owned by John S. Woodrum, one-fourth by D. B. Strouse, and one-half by E. B. Fishburn, and others. The apple industry may be said to be in its infancy. It is conservatively estimated that within the territory embraced in this particular section of Roanoke County, that at least twenty trees which are not bearing fruit have been planted and are growing, to every one that is now yielding a profit to the planter. A few years ago, the fruit growers realized that without adopting the modern spraying methods, and properly caring for their fruit, the best results could not be obtained. As a result, there is scarcely an orchard in this whole section which is not sprayed regularly, and the demand for material thus created, resulted in the location at Roanoke, Virginia, during the year just past of a plant for the manufacture of spraying material. The Bent Mountain section comprises many valuable farms and homesteads. The people are progressive, and are well supplied with schools and churches. A telephone system, recently installed gives the people direct communication with the city of Roanoke. Other Lines of Industry The soil is well adapted to the production of all kinds of crops, such as wheat, rye, corn, and buckwheat. It is doubtful if any section of the United States grows larger or sweeter cabbage, and the yield of potatoes is sometimes enormous. Cattle raising is given much attention, while many farmers are devoting much time to blooded horses and hogs. No better sheep country can be found, and as many as six hundred head have been seen on a single farm on Bent Mountain. After ascending the mountain a beautiful plateau, practically level, stretches out for miles. The land is well watered by streams and branches flowing from innumerable springs of free-stone water, almost ice-cold. History of Roanoke County—Bent Mountain Situated some two thousand seven hundred feet above sea level, there is always a delightful breeze in the hottest summer weather and blankets are in demand for sleeping purposes at all seasons of the year. And such is the story of the settlement, progress, and development of Bent Mountain. In the succeeding pages will be found sketches of the live, progressive citizenship of this favored section. Biographical COLONEL ANDREW LEWIS Colonel Andrew Lewis, fourth son of General Andrew Lewis, settled on Bent Mountain and died at his home. "Longwood," in Roanoke County, September 25th, 1844. He had five brothers and one sister, as follows: John, Thomas, Samuel, William, Charles, and Anne. All of the brothers distinguished themselves in the early history of this country with the exception of Charles, who died at the age of fifteen and was buried at "Richfield," the home place of General Andrew Lewis, near Salem, Virginia. Colonel Andrew Lewis, like his father, was a valiant Indian fighter, winning for himself a colonelcy in the early wars. He bore the name of his distinguished father and is said to have greatly resembled him in appearance. He settled on Bent Mountain, eighteen miles distant from the present city of Roanoke. He built the first house on Bent Mountain, a primitive log structure, a story and a half high, which has sheltered five generations of the descendants of the Lewises. The place he named "Longwood," and "Longwood" it is to-day. The old building is still standing, and although unoccupied is in a fair state of preservation. Colonel Andrew Lewis at one time was the owner of many thousands of acres of Bent Mountain lands. He was twice married, his first wife being Agatha Madison, daughter of John and Agatha (Strother) Madison, she being a sister of James Madison, the first Episcopal Bishop in Virginia. Her father, John Madison, the first Clerk of Augusta County, was a member of the first vestry organized in Augusta, and was active in setting on foot the exploring expeditions which led to the settlement of Kentucky. He was a prominent and useful citizen of the Virginia Colony and was influential in the Revolution. But one daughter was born to this union, Margaret Lewis, who became the wife of Colonel Elijah McClanahan. Nine daughters were born to the McClanahans, and their descendants are among the most prominent of Roanoke County families. After the death of his first wife, Colonel Lewis married a Miss Bryan, sister of James Bryan, an early landholder near Salem. Two children were born to them, Catherine (Kitty) Lewis and Thomas Lewis. The home of Colonel Andrew Lewis, which became known as the Bent House, and which was afterwards destroyed by fire, was the scene of many happy entertainments in the early history of this country. His first wife was a cousin of President Madison, and they were visited by such distinguished citizens of the Commonwealth as John Randolph, of Roanoke, and Light Horse Harry Lee. Following an itinerary mapped out for them by General Washington, Louis Philippi with his brothers, Count de Montpensier and Count Beaugolis, spent a night in this hospitable home. After the destruction of the Bent House by fire, Colonel Lewis again moved into "Longwood," the first house ever erected in this part of the county, a picture of which accompanies this sketch. It was here that the remaining days of his life were spent. His only son, Thomas Lewis, was killed in a duel with a man named McHenry, known throughout the country as the Lewis-McHenry duel. The men had been fast friends, but a dispute arose over an election and the code duello was invoked to settle the difficulty. Rifles were chosen as the weapons and a distance of thirty paces agreed upon. Both men were accustomed to the use of the weapon selected. McHenry said to his second upon taking his position: "Do you see that button on Lewis's coat? I mean to strike him there." He was true to his word. At the first shot Thomas Lewis fell dead and his antagonist fell mortally wounded, dying shortly afterwards. Bent Mountain in those early days was the home of the panther, the wolf, and the bear, and many stories are extant of the encounters of Colonel Lewis and his son, Thomas, in subduing not only the forests but the wild native animals which roamed them. On one occasion it is told of Thomas Lewis, while strolling through the woods with a friend, his dog treed a panther, and neither man being armed, young Lewis held the animal at bay until his companion traveled over a mile and back for a rifle, a single discharge from which brought the fierce animal to their feet dead. Thomas Lewis never married. Catherine Lewis, better known as "Kittie," was married to Joseph King, of Montgomery County, February 24th, 1807. Captain King, who was a distinguished citizen of Montgomery, owned the valuable estate known as "White House," at Shawsville. Catherine Lewis was born April 16th, 1789. She knew the Republic in its infancy, passed through the War of 1812, the Mexican War, and the Civil War. Her life was spent at "Longwood," sharing the place until his death with her father. Ten children History of Roanoke County—Bent Mountain were born to Captain Joseph King and his wife, all of whom are now dead and their descendants are scattered all over the United States. In an old leather covered trunk at "Longwood" were many valuable papers belonging to Colonel Andrew Lewis, but they have recently become scattered through persons going over and assorting them, keeping such as they desired as relics. Among them were letters to Colonel Lewis from William Wirt, James Mason, and Light Horse Harry Lee, with one to General Lewis from Patrick Henry, and a legal document signed by Thomas Jefferson as Governor of Virginia. Mrs. George W. Powell, a great granddaughter of Colonel Lewis, is the possessor of a miniature daguerrotype of him in solid gold frame, which is said to be an exact likeness, and from which the portrait accompanying this sketch is a reproduction. The writer of this sketch has in his possession two land grants on treasury warrants to Andrew Lewis and Matthew Pate, from Governor William B. Giles, under date of October 27th, 1829, one being for sixteen and the other for seventy-four acres of land in Montgomery County. Both documents are well preserved and both contain the signature of Governor Giles and the seal of Virginia. Another interesting document found among the papers of Colonel Lewis is a copy of a deed from Samuel Lewis, of Augusta County, to Andrew Lewis, under date of July 20th, 1788. The deed conveys to Andrew Lewis one thousand six hundred acres of land in Augusta County, three tracts comprising one thousand six hundred acres of land in Greenbrier County, eight hundred acres in Botetourt County, a house and lot and land in Charlottesville, Virginia. The consideration in the deed was the payment of five shillings and the assumption and payment of all of the just debts of Samuel Lewis, "which he honestly desires to secure and pay to his several creditors." A further indenture is included in the deed in which Samuel Lewis sells to Andrew Lewis one negro man named Charles and one negro woman named Elise, forty head of horses, mares, and colts, twenty-five head of black cattle, together with all his farming implements, and the products of his farm. Andrew Lewis was authorized in the deed to settle up the entire estate of Samuel Lewis, "extricating him from his present embarrassments." THE KING FAMILY Joseph King was born June 1st, 1776, and died April 6th, 1838. He married Catherine Lewis, daughter of Colonel Andrew Lewis, of "Longwood" on Bent Mountain, on February 24th, 1807. Joseph King was prominent in the history of Montgomery County, being the owner of the fine estate, "White House," at Shawsville. To this union were born ten children, as follows: Charles Lewis, born January 15th, 1808, died October 28th, 1864; John Trigg, born February 22d, 1810, died March 11th, 1850; Katherine Ann, born November 9th, 1812; Margaret E., born August 9th, 1815, died in Decatur, Alabama; Andrew Lewis, born July 12th, 1817, died in San Jose, California, 1905; Joseph Rayburn, born March 17th, 1820, died at "Longwood," August 21st, 1892; James Trigg, born August 4th, 1824, died May 1st, 1827; Agnes Josephine, born July 11th, 1824, died September 20th, 1880; Mary M., born May 9th, 1827; Robert Woods, born June 15th, 1831, died June 8th, 1878. JOSEPH RAYBURN KING Joseph Rayburn King was born March 17th, 1820, being a son of Captain Joseph King and Kitty (Lewis) King. In early life he married Sallie F. Johnson, and to them four daughters were born, as follows. Florence Margaret, who now resides in Oklahoma, and who was married to J. A. Atkins; Okee V., who married George W. Powell and resides on Bent Mountain on a portion of the old King homestead, and which was formerly the property of her great grandfather, Colonel Andrew Lewis; Viola M., who first married Stephen Willett, of Roanoke County, and after his death, married William C. Johnson, and who now resides in New Mexico—Mrs. Johnson is the owner of "Longwood," the home of her distinguished grandfather, Colonel Andrew Lewis; and one other, Hattie E., who married A. B. McGeehan, who died March 10th, 1911. She now resides near Roanoke. Joseph Rayburn King was a valiant Confederate soldier, serving throughout the Civil War. A well preserved letter dated April 23d, 1864, from "Longwood," which Mrs. Kitty King wrote to her son contains the following which will show the war-time conditions as they existed on Bent Mountain: "Some of the people in the neighborhood are very bad off for provisions; corn is scarce and twenty dollars per bushel; flour three hundred dollars per barrel, and money of very little account." In the letter the proud mother also writes that she is glad to hear that the officers are pleased with her son, with the further statement that it is a good thing to have the good will of them. She further states that as Thomas Puckett is going to join his regiment it afforded a good opportunity to write and send him a pair of socks, a towel and a piece of soap. The war over, he returned to his Bent Mountain home to take up the battle of life on the farm and repair what had been lost through the four years' conflict. That he commanded the respect and confidence of all who knew him is well attested by the fact that for a period of nearly thirty years he served continuously as a Justice of the Peace on Bent Mountain. GEORGE W. POWELL George W. Powell was born in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, and moved to Bent Mountain in 1868. In 1881 he married Okee V. King. daughter of "Squire" Joseph R. and Sallie Johnson King, she being a great granddaughter of Colonel Andrew Lewis. Seven History of Roanoke County—Bent Mountain children were born to them as follows: Charles, who grew to manhood and died at Bluefield, West Virginia, at the age of twenty-four years. His remains were buried at the old home at Air Point; Florence, Lula, Kitty Lewis, Joseph, George Dewey, and Merritt. Florence and Lula are teachers in the public schools of Roanoke County. Mr. Powell is the owner of a valuable orchard tract,—his farm comprising about one hundred acres of the fertile lands of Bent Mountain, and is a portion of the original tract owned by Colonel Andrew Lewis. Mr. Powell has been interested for many years in fruit culture and has planted something like a thousand apple trees of the leading commercial varieties, such as the Pippin, Ben Davis, Johnson's Winter and Rome Beauty. Mr. Powell is regarded as one of Bent Mountain's progressive citizens, and no man stands higher in the estimation of the public and of all who know him than the subject of this sketch. JOHN COLES Perhaps the best known citizen of the Bent Mountain district is John Coles, who was born in Pittsylvania County, in 1836, being the only son of John Coles, Sr., also a native of Pittsylvania County, Virginia, the latter being born in 1800, and died of typhoid fever in 1848. John Coles, Sr., was at one time the owner of a tract of fourteen thousand acres of Bent Mountain lands. These lands were originally comprised in the vast territory owned and controlled by Colonel Andrew Lewis, later owned by a man named Clark. The lands were purchased by the Senior Coles from John M. Price, of Fincastle, Virginia, the price paid being $12,000. On the plateau of Bent Mountain was included a boundary of twelve hundred acres, which was said to be worth as much as was paid for the entire boundary at the time. To-day many thousand fruit trees are growing on the mountain sides and on the plateau, and it is roughly estimated that the acreage formerly owned by John Coles, Sr., is now worth the sum of $250,000. John Coles. Sr., married Louisa Payne, of Campbell County, Virginia, one son, John, the subject of this sketch, being born to this union. The daughters were Katherine Thompson, who married Captain Joseph M.

The plant of the Fruit Growers' Telephone Corporation is one of the best in the county, being of the metallic circuit system and the telephones installed in the homes and business houses of the subscribers are of the latest improved models, and the service is excellent throughout. Within less than one year after the installation of the plant, and the connection with the Virginia &amp; Tennessee Telephone Company, the Corporation had more than twenty-five subscribers, all of whom are located in and around Poages Mill, within a radius of two miles of the central office. Arrangements are being made for the extension of these lines throughout the great pippin apple section of the county, and within a few months practically every apple grower will be in a position to telephone from his own home to the best fruit markets of the United States.

He is one of the county's progressive young business men. ANDREW JACKSON HOWELL Andrew Jackson Howell was born in Floyd County, Virginia, December 22d, 1858. He is a son of Isaac and Nancy Howell, of Floyd County, and when a boy attended the country schools. His paternal grandfather was Davy Howell, one of the first settlers of Floyd. He served in the war of 1812. Two of his younger brothers, Dill and Worth Howell, and two brothers-in-law, Clark Pugh and Jack Earles, were all soldiers in the Civil War, and not a single one lived to return to their homes. It is not known where they were killed. These brave Confederates fill unknown graves. His maternal grandparents were Jacob and Susie Wade, long since deceased. On August 18th, 1877, he married Hannah A. Dewese, of Floyd County. To this union the following children were born: Charles A. Howell, who married Amanda A. Wimmer, of Floyd County, and resides in Roanoke City; Anna Howell, who married William History of Roanoke County—Bent Mountain Weaver, and resides at Roanoke, Virginia; Harvey I. Howell, who married Flora Bowman and resides on Bent Mountain; Blanche Howell, who married Robert Wirt, of Salem, and resides in Roanoke City; Robert Howell, unmarried and who resides at Roanoke, Virginia, being in the service of the Roanoke Railway and Electric Company; Flora Howell, unmarried and resides with her parents. Mr. Howell has resided on Bent Mountain for thirteen years where he is well known and highly respected. He has a good home and one of the best small orchards in the county, the trees being largly of the Johnson's Winter variety. His son Robert Howell, of Roanoke, is largely interested in the ownership of the Howell home on Bent Mountain. He is trustworthy and is regarded as one of the most valuable men in the employ of the Roanoke Railway and Electric Company. He has been in the employ of this enterprise for six years. ELIJAH POAGE Elijah Poage, one of the most widely known as well as one of the most highly respected citizens of Roanoke County, most of whose life was spent at Poages Mill, was born in Rockbridge County, Virginia, June 14th, 1823, and died February 14th, 1900, aged seventy-six years and eight months. He was a son of John T. and Margaret Poage, the former being born June 24th, 1769, and died January 24th, 1840. The latter was born in York County, Pennsylvania, August 29th, 1789, and died June 30th, 1869, aged eighty-six years, ten months and one day. Four other children, three sons and one daughter, were born to John and Margaret Poage, namely: George, John, and Joseph. The daughter was Jane Poage, afterwards married to William Grisso. Elijah Poage, better known as "Squire Poage" settled in Roanoke County at Poages Mill when quite a young man. He married Mary M. Sloan. No children were born to them. Mary M. (Sloan) Poage was born July 1st, 1827. She survived her husband by nearly six years, having died January 4th, 1906, aged seventy-eight years, six months and three days. Elijah Poage was a mechanic and a fine cabinet maker. Long before the Civil War broke out he had a foot turning lathe and manufactured chairs with "turned" posts and rounds which were purchased by the well-to-do class of that day. Later he built Poages Mill for the manufacture of flour and corn meal. Later a sawmill of the old "sash" variety was added, and when the day of the "circular" saw came, with his usual enterprise, he established the first "circular" sawmill in the southern part of the county, or perhaps in the whole county. The post office at Poages Mill was named for the founder of the place, a half century or more ago. Soon after the Civil War, Elijah Poage was elected Justice of the Peace for Cave Spring District and was continuously reölected until the time of his death. He established a cabinet shop at Poages Mill and for nearly fifty years made coffins and burial caskets, and was engaged in the undertaking business, being one of the oldest undertakers from point of service in the county. About thirty years ago he built a fine home on Back Creek which he occupied until the time of his death. The home is now occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Charles Poage. ROSCOE CONKLIN WERTZ Roscoe Conklin Wertz, the eldest son of Kyles Griffin and Lutie J. (Poage) Wertz, was born June 7th, 1880, near Poages Mill, in Roanoke County. When a boy, he attended the country schools and the Botetourt Normal College, at Daleville, Virginia; also taking a training course at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Crop Pest Commission Work, after which he was appointed State Inspector of Virginia, since which time he has been looking after the orchards and nursery work of the State, appointing inspectors and doing all in his power to rid the valuable orchards of Virginia of the various pests with which they have been afflicted for many years. Besides his work as a state officer, he has had charge of the Wertz plantation and apple orchards for eighteen years, or since the death of his father in 1893. On this plantation are 1,800 apple trees composed largely of pippins and other leading commercial varieties. A few of these trees were planted before the marriage of Kyles Griffin Wertz, his father, and the orchard has grown from a few trees planted prior to 1879, when he was married, to one of the largest producing commercial orchards in the county. He kept up the planting of trees every year until his death. This is one of the oldest orchards on Back Creek, and on the plantation and situated near the family residence are a number of trees over one hundred years old, having been planted by Levi Hays, one of the first settlers of the Back Creek Section. The Wertz family originally came from Pennsylvania. Kyles Griffin Wertz, a son of John Wertz, was born July 19th, 1846, and died November 9th, 1903. His life was practically spent on the farm on which he was born and reared. On what was termed the "Sixteen Roll Call," he went into the Confederate Army, serving until the close of the war. On January 23d, 1879, he married Lutie J. Poage, daughter of George and Ellen Poage. They picked their first load of pippin apples from young trees planted by Mr. Wertz in 1880, all of which were held in a single wagon body. During the past eight years the Wertz History of Roanoke County—Bent Mountain orchards have yielded good crops, not a failure being recorded during that time, the average being about one thousand barrels per year. Besides Roscoe Conklin Wertz, the subject of this sketch, other children born to Kyles Griffin and Lutie J. Wertz were Nora E., married James L. Richardson; Sylvia; Myrtle, married W. D. Hunt; Oscar; Roy; Maynard; Beulah; Otho, and Marvin—the last two deceased. CHARLES JOHNSON SMALLWOOD Charles Johnson Smallwood, the subject of this sketch, is a son of the late David Selden and Mary Catherine (Dungan) Smallwood, and was born in Smyth County, Virginia, September 29th, 1862, being a descendant of President Andrew Johnson. He was seven years old when his mother died. Several years afterwards his father passed away, leaving him an orphan. He went to live with his uncle, John W. Dungan, and in early life his schooling was neglected, but as he grew to manhood, determined to have an education, he started to school. After two terms and his entry upon the third term of ten months, he was offered a position to learn the carpenter's trade, and through the advice of Dr. J. S. Apperson, a friend, he accepted same, and began his business career under J. S. Morris, a contractor of Chilhowie, Virginia. On September 10th, 1883, he moved to Roanoke, Virginia, and drove his first nail in that city on Church Avenue. Later he began contracting and building houses in the city and county. Many of the best residences of the Bent Mountain section were erected by him. Mr. Smallwood is regarded as one of the best orchardists in the county. He leased a small tract of land in the orchard belt many years ago and started a nursery, growing his own trees, from which he later planted an orchard of twenty-six acres on a tract of land willed to Mrs. Smallwood by her father. Later he purchased the fine orchard on Back Creek formerly owned by James W. Turner. This orchard to-day is valued at $25,000, and ranks as one of the largest and most valuable pippin orchards in the county. On October 27th, 1884, Mr. Smallwood married Louvenia Ferguson, daughter of Samuel and Malinda (Hayes) Ferguson, of Back Creek, and to them the following children have been born: Ernest Emmett, George Diver, John Wilson, Mary May, Luther Bell, Emma Sarah Della, Jennie, deceased, Selden, Bertha, deceased. Mr. Smallwood is one of the county's most progressive citizens, his hospitable home being one of the very best in the southern end of the county. He has been twice elected, and is now a Justice of the Peace for Cave Spring District. His various apple orchards number two thousand trees, mostly of the pippin variety, and to-day, through his efforts, his holdings are estimated to be worth $50,000. WILLIAM BAILEY ATKINS William Bailey Atkins was the eldest son of Amos and Margaret Griffith Atkins, being born in the State of Indiana in 1827. A few years after his birth he removed with his parents to Franklin County, Virginia, which had been the early home of his mother, Margaret Griffith Atkins. It was there that the subject of this sketch grew to manhood, and at the age of twenty-two years married Edith Akers. To this union nine children were born, viz: James Amos, Annie Amelia, Thomas Clemens, Levi Burrell, Laura May, Margaret Selina, Nathaniel B., Bettie Cordelia, and Maranda Atkins. In the year 1862 William B. Atkins removed with his wife and interesting family of children to Bent Mountain from Franklin County, and settled, buying a farm from David Aliff on the headwaters of Back Creek, where he lived until the day of his death and reared his family of children to manhood and womanhood. James Amos Atkins, the oldest son, married Florence King, and shortly afterwards removed to Dallas County, Texas, where he spent several years, later removing to Oklahoma, where he now resides. The second son, Thomas Clemens, died in infancy. Levi Burrell became a minister of the Gospel in the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and in 1894 joined the Baltimore Conference of that denomination and has been and is now a trusted member of that body. Nathaniel B. Atkins, the fourth son, has long been a resident of the city of Roanoke, where he has been identified with the Virginia Bridge and Iron Company as General Superintendent. He married a Miss Nash, of Amherst County. Annie Amelia became the wife of Benjamin Griffith, of Franklin County, Virginia, and died in the city of Norfolk a few years ago. Laura May married Samuel Davis, of Franklin County, and died at her home in 1899. Margaret Selina married Captain J. W. Bondurant, an officer of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway, and resides at present in Lynchburg, Virginia. Bettie Cordelia married Edward Jones, of Montgomery County, and resides at Lambert's Point, Virginia, where he is foreman of the Norfolk &amp; Western shops. Maranda became the wife of P. T. Lavender, Superintendent of the Norfolk &amp; Western smith shop at Roanoke, Virginia. At the outbreak of the Civil War, William Bailey History of Roanoke County—Bent Mountain Atkins joined his fortunes with the Southern Confederacy and, in the year 1862, volunteered for his country's service. He became a member of the Twenty-Second Virginia Regiment, and participated in the battles of Pearisburg, Virginia, Lewisburg, West Virginia, and New Market, Virginia, serving under Generals McCausland, Heath, and Breckenridge. During the war and its consequent vicissitudes, and through exposure, he contracted rheumatism and a bronchial trouble, from which he never fully recovered, and was occasionally a great sufferer until the day of his death, which occurred May 4th, 1884, at his home on Bent Mountain. Soon after locating on Bent Mountain, Mr. Atkins, together with his mother, professed religion and both became identified with the Methodist Church, in which faith he spent the remainder of his life. When William B. Atkins volunteered his services to the Southern Confederacy three brothers, Levi, Thomas, and Nathaniel, volunteered with him. William B. Atkins, the subject of this sketch, was the only one that survived the war, as the others were killed in the battles. THOMAS MARTIN BELL Thomas Martin Bell was born in Henry County, Virginia, April 24th, 1864, being the son of George M. and Susan (Hodges) Bell, both of whom are now dead. He moved to Roanoke County in infancy, his parents settling at Bellview, near Cave Spring. During his boyhood he attended the county schools, and on the eighteenth of December, 1885, married Mrs. Drue E. (Lavinder) Wertz. To this union the following children have been born: Otho C., Annie G., Howard T., Lottie Sue, Bulah M., George M., Luther D., Carson G., Pearl T., and Paul B. Bulah died at the age of three years and George at the age of nine. Mr. Bell is one of the most progressive of Roanoke County's apple growers, and is the owner of two fine pippin orchards. He now has in bearing one thousand trees, besides two thousand not bearing, his orchard being divided about equally between the pippin and winesap varieties. It has been his usual custom to sell his fruit to packers in the orchards, and for a number of years he has been deriving a handsome income from the results of his labors. He was Assessor of Land in 1910 for Cave Spring and Big Lick districts. It was largely due to his efforts that the assessments on apple orchards were materially increased during the past year, thus giving to the state and county a largely increased revenue from the valuable orchard lands which in the past were regarded as being assessed too low. He is a member of the Electoral Board of Roanoke County, and has served in that capacity for a period of six years. He is a Democrat of the old school, and has accomplished much good for the interests of the party in Roanoke County. KYLES GRIFFIN ALIFF Among the citizens of Roanoke County deserving of special praise for what they have accomplished, circumstances considered, there is none more worthy of emulation than Kyles Griffin Aliff. What he has accomplished in the apple growing district of Roanoke County but few men would have had the determination and hardihood to have attempted. Married on November 25th, 1876, to Sarah Parrish, daughter of O. Parrish, of Roanoke County, he settled on the headwaters of the Hayes branch of Back Creek in a mountain wilderness. There was nothing but rocks and trees and ravines, with scarcely enough level land on which to set a house. He began life by clearing up an old tract of mountain land containing two hundred and seven acres. By hard work he made a living, and a quarter of a century ago, as he cleared the land he began planting apple trees, half pippins and half of other commercial varieties at first. Today he has planted in these ravines and hollows one thousand thrifty apple trees. Four hundred are bearing, the remaining six hundred trees are young pippins. The land now owned by him was at one time assessed so low that the taxes amounted to but fifty cents. To-day the assessment yields a tax of $52. Messrs. Bowles and Martin, expert apple growers of Albemarle County, visited this plantation and testified in the Roanoke County Circuit Court that Mr. Aliff deserved to be pensioned by the State for what he had accomplished rather than to be exorbitantly taxed by the Government. Kyles Griffin Aliff, a son of Jonas and Annie (Hayes) Aliff, was born in Roanoke County in 1856, and of three brothers and five sisters is the only living brother, and Mrs. Elizabeth Minnix, of Roanoke, Virginia, the only surviving sister. To his marriage to Sarah Parrish there were born ten children, as follows: Ballard, married to Nannie Neff; Elias; Lee; Cora, married to Millard Bohon, of Roanoke; Sidney; Florence, married to Leslie Bohon; Tempie, married to Henry Grisso; Laura; Pernie; and Vesta, all of whom are living. JOHN BENJAMIN WILLETT John Benjamin Willett, the subject of this sketch, is one of the county's most progressive young business men. He was born on Bent Mountain January History of Roanoke County—Bent Mountain 10th, 1874, being the youngest son of Francis Marion and Mary A. (Henry) Willett, his mother being a daughter of the late Samuel Henry, of Poages Mill, Virginia. His boyhood was spent on his father's farm, and he attended the country schools, and when quite young he became deeply interested in the planting of apple trees. He owned a fine orchard on Bent Mountain which he recently sold to Jordan Woodrum. On February 3d, 1894, he married Alice Baldwin, eldest daughter of Joseph and Eliza (Hayes) Baldwin, of Bent Mountain. To them three children have been born, as follows: Myrabell, aged sixteen; Roy Baldwin, aged fourteen, and John Eldridge, aged nine. In 1906, John Benjamin Willett formed a copartnership with H. E. Bowman, under the firm name of Bowman &amp; Willett for the purpose of conducting a mercantile business in Roanoke, Virginia, at 511 and 513 South Jefferson Street, and he removed with his family to that city. After three years in Roanoke, the firm established a branch general merchandise store at Poages Mill, Roanoke County, with Mr. Willett as manager of the establishment, also of the large orchard interests of the firm on Bent Mountain. The farm and orchard owned by Messrs. Bowman and Willett is on the Bent Mountain turnpike, and located right at the "great bend." The orchard comprises some 1,700 bearing pippin trees, and yielded a handsome crop this year. Mr. Willett is Vice President and a director of the Fruit Growers' Telephone Corporation, the central office of which is under his supervision, being located in the Bowman &amp; Willett store building at Poages Mill. The firm of Bowman &amp; Willett does a general jobbing business in apples and makes a specialty of buying and shipping in carload lots. JAMES WILLIAM TURNER James William Turner is the third son of the late Gideon and Ruth (Fields) Turner, and is one of a family of twelve children, there being six sons and six daughters. He was born in Roanoke County, August 14th, 1847, and received his education in such schools as the neighborhood afforded, prior to the Civil War. When the Civil War broke out between the states, he was a mere boy, and upon reaching the age of seventeen years, entered the service of the Confederacy and became a member of Company F, Second Battalion Virginia Reserves. He was afterwards transferred to Griffin's Battery, First Virginia Artillery, and served in the campaigns in Eastern Virginia and was with General Lee at the surrender at Appomattox. The war over, he returned to his Roanoke County home and began life as a farmer. He was a student at Roanoke College from September, 1868, to March, 1870. In early life he married Julia Kate Price, the daughter of Tazewell and Betty M. Price, of Bent Mountain. Soon after his marriage he began the planting of apple trees on Back Creek, and to-day is the owner of one of the finest orchards in the county. For six years he was a Public School Trustee and for four years a Justice of the Peace in the Cave Spring District. He is also a director of the Fruit Growers' Telephone Corporation, and is regarded as being one of the county's most highly respected and prosperous apple growers. His children are: Mary Lee, James Russell, Ruth Ernestine, Lewis Weir, and Roland Price.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HISTORY OF ROANOKE CITY By E. B. JACOBS DEDICATION THE history of the development and upbuilding of the city of Roanoke presents a record of notable achievements, which stand as a lasting tribute to the enterprise and energy that have always been characteristic of her people. The men who have made possible the Roanoke of to-day are those who began the work of progress in the days of Big Lick, their successors, whose persistent efforts contributed to results that have made Roanoke the pride of her people, and those who at present are devoting their best service to the cause of her future advancement. To these men of action and loyalty to the interests of the city, this work is dedicated. FOREWORD WHILE the history of Roanoke covers but the brief period of thirty years, the present prominence of the city, and the influence of its growth in the development of Southwest Virginia, combine to make the record of Roanoke's achievements of commanding interest as an example of the energy and enterprise displayed by progressive cities throughout the South. The story of the growth of Roanoke from a cross-roads village to the city's present proportions is not only picturesque, but it contains a lesson of dramatic force. It portrays the confidence and determination of a people possessing supreme faith in their city's future, and exemplifies a spirit that enabled them to surmount obstacles which were encountered during the city's development. Naturally, in the process of its evolution from a modest hamlet to a city of noble proportions, ranking third in size in the State, it was only through successive gradations that the present militant spirit of progressiveness became so characteristic of Roanoke citizenship. The groundwork was laid by the earlier residents, whose public spirit and willingness to make personal sacrifices for the welfare of the community proved an inspiration for future generations, and was of inestimable value in developing a keen interest in public affairs and a coöperation which have been productive of magnificent results. In this narrative of Roanoke's advancement from the early days of Big Lick to its present position among the leading cities of the South, the various forces which contributed to its growth are noted and given prominence in the work. While it is not possible at all times to describe in detail the factors which helped to give impetus to the city's upbuilding, what is set forth has been written with due regard for accuracy, and is based on information compiled from sources deemed reliable and authentic. HISTORY OF THE CITY Early Settlements in the Shenandoah Valley. In the year 1716 Governor Alexander Spottswood led a well-equipped party of about fifty men from the colonial capital, then called the "Middle Plantations," and later named Williamsburg, passing on the line of western march the iron works which he had shortly before established near Germanna on the Rappahannock. The ascent of the Blue Ridge was made at or near the crossing now known as Swift Run Gap, where his party first beheld the Valley of Virginia, through which flow the waters of the Shenandoah, named by the Indians "Daughter of the Stars." In recognition of the importance of this expedition Governor Spottswood was knighted by the king of England, and each member of the party received a miniature golden horse shoe. From this incident they have been frequently referred to as "Knights of the Golden Horse Shoe." This journey of exploration opened the way for conquest and possession of one of the fairest and most productive sections of Virginia. In 1732 other parties entered the great Valley by way of Harper's Ferry, and in 1734 still others settled in that portion known as Shenandoah. From 1735 to 1738 further settlements were made on the James River in the vicinity of Buchanan. Two converging streams of immigration began the exploration and conquest of the wilderness. The one was composed of the sons of English cavaliers History of Roanoke City who crossed the Blue Ridge at Buford's Gap, near Blue Ridge Springs, the other being descendants of the Scotch-Irish and Palatinates of Pennsylvania who came up the great valley. First White Men to Visit the Roanoke Valley In 1726 two frontiersmen, John Marlin and Thomas Salling by name, proceeded up the Shenandoah Valley, crossed the James River and reached the Roanoke River, where Salling was captured by a band of Cherokee Indians, Marlin however escaping. These two adventurous pioneers were the first white men who are known to have visited the Roanoke Valley. After several years of captivity Salling secured his release and returned to Williamsburg, where he met John Lewis and his sons, and also John Mackey, an Irish immigrant, to whom he gave glowing descriptions of the section of country he had visited and in which he had spent his captivity. Mackey later settled on Middle River above Staunton near Buffalo Gap, while Salling, who was of a more venturesome nature, located at the forks of James River. His cabin was the outpost of civilization, but the result of his reconnoitering expedition with Marlin was that within the next few years the pioneers pressed forward into the fertile Roanoke Valley, and the work of settlement and reclamation from the wilderness began. The Great Indian Trail Through the valleys of East Tennessee and Southwest Virginia ran the "Great Path" or Indian trail, which, on account of its central position and direct course, was the most practicable route for communication between the Northern and the Southern Indians, as nowhere else could the great Appalachian Chain be so easily ascended and crossed. Its course lay along the older portion of the town of Salem, crossing Mason's Creek just north of Pitzer's Cliff, thence across the hills to Peters Creek to a point near the old town of Gainsborough, where it diverged into two branches, the one running eastward by way of Bonsack and Coyner's Springs, crossing the Blue Ridge at Buford's Gap; while the other route of travel passed by Cloverdale, through Botetourt County, and thence down the valley. In later years, after white settlements had been established, there was a slight divergence from both the Valley and the Eastern trail, in order that the pioneers traveling westward might reach "Belmont," the home of Colonel William Fleming, situated on the east bank of Tinker Creek. Near the point of divergence of the great Indian trail was a free flowing spring of water, and this spot naturally became the camping ground, not only for the Indians during their expeditions, but later for the pioneers and settlers while on their way to new homes in the valleys west of the Blue Ridge. It has been estimated that during the days of pioneer life in Southwest Virginia no less than sixty-eight thousand persons camped from time to time in the vicinity of this spring, which is located in the northeast section of Roanoke City and is known as the Franklin Mineral Spring. Nearby was a large saline marsh to which deer and other animals came to procure salt, and as it was the largest deer lick of the kind in this part of the country it became known to the early settlers as the "Big Lick." Consequently, when a settlement grew up nearby, it also took the name of Big Lick and was a convenient stopping-place for wagoners in early pioneer days. Building of Gainsborough The first practical effort to establish a town in the vicinity of Big Lick was the building of Gainsborough, which derived its name from Kemp Gaines, who owned the land on which it was built. In 1825 it was but a mere hamlet consisting of two frame buildings on the Southwest corner of the Lynchburg Turnpike and the Franklin Road. Afterward, when it had grown into a village with two churches, several stores and a blacksmith shop, it was designated "Old Lick" to distinguish it from the new village which had sprung up around the depot a short distance west, and which assumed the name of Big Lick. The nucleus of the latter settlement was the stone house built by William Stover in the year 1797, this date being marked on the wall at the time of its construction, according to an old-time custom. This house and the surrounding farm afterward became the property of John Trout and was his home at the time of his death. The Ponce de Leon hotel has been erected on the site of the old Trout house, and a portion of the stone wall is still standing and composes a part of the rear building of the hotel. Prestonville Shortly after the war of 1812 a scheme was projected by a company called the Roanoke Navigation Company, the object being to make the Roanoke River navigable by means of dams and sluices from Weldon, North Carolina, to Salem, Virginia. The plan also contemplated the opening of Tinker Creek for navigation from the point where it empties into the Roanoke River to the crossing of Tinker Creek by the Lynchburg and Salem turnpike, about a mile above the Crozer Furnace. It was the intention of the Company to build a town at this point, to be known as Prestonville, and a tract of land was purchased and History of Roanoke City laid off into lots, a portion of which had been sold when the whole undertaking was abandoned on account of financial reverses sustained by the men who had organized the Company. Big Lick's Boom in 1834 During the year of 1834 another town scheme was organized by citizens of Big Lick, who laid off a town into lots, streets and alleys, and in May of that year an auction sale was held which was largely attended by people from all parts of the county. The promoters, however, disagreed about the business of the Company, with the result that this second attempt to build a town in this vicinity was also abandoned. Therefore, the city of Roanoke is the result of the third effort to build a city in this immediate section. Big Lick Incorporated When Roanoke County was formed in 1838 there was a strong sentiment in favor of making Big Lick (the Old Lick) the county seat on account of its central location, but after due consideration Salem was selected, and as a portion of Montgomery County was afterward added to Roanoke County it made Salem the more central point. In 1838 there were but three houses in the new Big Lick, and not until 1852 did the place begin to show signs of growth, when several new buildings were erected. In 1853 a blacksmith shop and a small office building were erected, and here improvements ceased, with the exception of the building of the Virginia &amp; Tennessee depot, until 1858, when the first tobacco factory was built. In 1870 several dwelling houses were built but there was little progress or development until the incorporation of Big Lick as a town in 1874. In 1874 the land on which the city of Roanoke is now built was owned by John Trout, Peyton L. Terry, Isham M. Ferguson, Mrs. Jane Lewis, Col. Geo. W. Carr, Ferdinand Rorer and Benjamin T. Tinsley. The latter owned all the land between the Carr farm and Franklin Road, which he afterwards sold to Peyton L. Terry. The farm had been the property in former years of William M. Peyton, whose residence was known as "Elmwood." The Rorer farm, lying on the east side of Commerce Street, and for the most part south of Campbell Avenue, belonged for many years before the war to John Shirey. The eastern part of the city is built on the Carr and Ferguson farms. On February 28th, 1874, the town of Big Lick was incorporated with John Trout as Mayor, and Ferdinand Rorer, Isham M. Ferguson, Peyton L. Terry, James M. Gambill, Dr. James McG. Kent and William Raines as Councilmen. The act of incorporation gives the boundaries as follows:— "Commencing at the depot of the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad in said town, and extending therefrom one-half mile north, east, south and west, and embracing the area contained therein, with the exception of the land of Mrs. Jane Lewis, which shall be excluded from said Corporation." At this time the business houses were located mainly on both sides of Commerce Street. In 1876 there were in the town three churches, Lutheran, Methodist and Presbyterian, seven dry-goods stores, one drug store, one bank, five tobacco factories, three tobacco warehouses, one plaster and flouring mill, one foundry, one tinware manufactory, one harness manufactory, one wagon and plow factory, two blacksmith shops, two photograph galleries and three saloons. Land around Big Lick could have been purchased at that time for the sum of $30.00 per acre. The Building of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad In 1881 when the first intimation came of the building of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad, Big Lick was a thriving town of six or seven hundred population and there had been a few more additions to the manufacturing and general business interests of the place. At this point in the history of the city of Roanoke, Philadelphia capitalists, who had bought and taken charge of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad, which had been built at that time as far south as Waynesboro, determined to make a connection with the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad, which was then in the hands of a receiver. They sent their agents and engineers to this section to select the most available point for a junction. It is a well known fact that the most important event in the history of Roanoke was the advent of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad. On a bright morning in June, 1881, a number of citizens of Big Lick gathered in front of a little building on the Southeast corner of Commerce Street and what is now known as First Avenue. A branch of the Lynchburg Trust Company conducted a banking business on the second floor of this building, which was one of the principal business structures at the time. Peyton L. Terry had just returned from Salem with news of the fact that negotiations between representatives of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad and citizens of Salem for bringing the terminus of the road to that point had proved unsuccessful. While the matter was being discussed, Peyton L. Terry remarked that if a subscription of only $10,000 was required, there was no reason why that sum could not be promptly raised, and the terminal secured for Big Lick. Among others in the party were T. T. Fishburne, Henry S. Trout, James M. Gambill, Col. Geo. P. Tayloe, E. G. McClanahan and the Rev. L. L. Lloyd, History of Roanoke City the last named being the young pastor of the Methodist Church. The result of this discussion was that a meeting was decided upon, and the "Big Lick Weekly News" printed posters which announced a meeting to be held that night at the "Neal House" for the purpose of devising plans whereby Big Lick might secure the terminal of the new line of railroad. When the meeting was called to order quite a gathering of citizens of Big Lick had responded to the call. Among those present were Peyton L. Terry, T. T. Fishburne, Henry S. Trout, S. W.

T. Rhodes and L. B. Taylor. After some preliminary discussion, it was agreed that a tender of $10,000 would be necessary to secure the rights of way and defray other expenses incident to locating the terminal at Big Lick, and the question of how the sum could be promptly subscribed was taken up. It was recognized that prompt action was necessary and the question as to who would subscribe was put to the meeting. T. T. Fishburne was the first to reply and pledged a subscription toward the cash bonus necessary to secure the road for Big Lick. A committee was immediately named for the purpose of raising the requisite amount of $10,000 and in a few hours that sum had been subscribed, Peyton L. Terry and Ferdinand Rorer being specially active in the work of raising the fund. Joseph I. Doran and other representatives of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad were at that time in Lexington, Virginia, considering the question of a point of connection for the road with the Norfolk &amp; Western, and no time was lost by the enterprising citizens of Big Lick in placing their proposition before this committee. In order to accomplish this promptly, Charles W. Thomas was deputized a special courier to convey the papers pledging the subscription of $10,000 as a cash bonus offered by the citizens of Big Lick to secure the terminal at that point. Mr. Thomas rode horseback throughout the night until he reached Arch Mills, where he delivered the papers to John C. Moomaw, who in turn carried them to Lexington, along with pledges which had been secured for a free right of way from Cloverdale to Big Lick, and delivered them to the committee which was in session at the time of his arrival. The members of the committee were strongly impressed by the progressive spirit shown by the citizens of the little village, and Col. U. L. Boyce who was one of the committee, as well as a prime mover in the project to build the road, remarked with emphasis, "Gentlemen, this brings the road to Big Lick!" The proposition was accepted, and Big Lick was made the connecting point of the Shenandoah Valley and the Norfolk &amp; Western lines of railway. A few months after it had been determined to bring the Shenandoah Valley line to a junction with the Norfolk &amp; Western at Big Lick, a visit was made to the town by Frederick J. Kimball and others associated with him in the project of building the road, and a meeting was held in the old Rorer Hall, which was largely attended, as the citizens were intensely interested in the matter. The "Big Lick Brass Band" furnished the music for the occasion, and many enthusiastic addresses were delivered. Col. U. L. Boyce predicted that within three years the town would have a population of five thousand, and at that time his statement was regarded as extremely visionary. Yet in January, 1884, in less time than he had specified, the population of the town had increased to five thousand two hundred and seventy-six. W. W. Coe, now General Manager of the Pocahontas Coal and Coke Company was Chief Engineer of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad during its construction from Hagerstown to Roanoke, and D. W. Flickwir was his principal assistant in charge of the work of construction from Loch Laird (now Buena Vista) to Big Lick. These officers of the road also planned the shops at Roanoke, the Hotel Roanoke and other important buildings along the line, and Mr. Coe was consulted in matters pertaining to laying out the future city of Roanoke. The Name of Big Lick Changed to That of "Roanoke" Shortly after this date another meeting was held in the old Rorer Hall building, until recently standing on the northeast corner of Campbell Avenue and Roanoke Street, for the purpose of selecting a new name for the town. Some of those present suggested the name of "Kimball" in honor of Frederick J. Kimball, president of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad. T. T. Fishburne suggested "Roanoke," and after some discussion it was decided to telegraph to Mr. Kimball and ascertain his wishes in the matter. Mr. Kimball at once replied, "By all means adopt the name of `Roanoke'." This was done, and when a new charter was granted and the territorial limits of the town were extended by Act of the Virginia Legislature February 3d, 1882, the old name of Big Lick was changed to that of Roanoke. History of Roanoke City It developed, however, that a minor post office in Virginia already bore the name of Roanoke, but Henry Fink, who was at that time Receiver of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad, succeeded in having a change made by the Postal authorities whereby the town of Big Lick was enabled to assume the name of Roanoke. The boundary lines as defined by the act of February 3d, 1882, are as follows:—"Beginning at the Norfolk &amp; Western bridge at Tinker Creek; thence a due line south to the Gish's mill road; thence with said road west to the forks of road leading into the lands of Col. Geo. P. Tayloe; thence a straight line southwest to the Franklin turnpike at a gate upon the lands of Mrs. Jane Lewis, on the road leading into the land of S. H. Gish; thence a straight line to the southwest corner of the land of William Taylor; thence due south to Roanoke River; thence with said river to the line of F. Rorer's and John N. Shaver's land; thence with said Rorer's and Shaver's land north to the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad; thence east to the land of Q. M. Word; thence to the line of H. S. Trout, R. B. Moorman and E. H. Ingle; thence with the lands of said R. B. Moorman and E. H. Ingle north to the Lynchburg and Salem road; thence with said road east to the road leading to Watts' mill; thence with said road to a spring near the mill; thence a straight line to the lands of Mrs. Lucy Campbell at the corner of the land of Henry Langhorne; thence east to said Mrs. Lucy Campbell's land to the corner of the lands of J. B. Muse and Dr. Miller; thence with the line of said Muse and Miller to the Lynchburg and Salem roads; thence with the south side of said road to the corner of the land of said Muse and Miller; thence with the land of said parties to the lands of the Roanoke Land and Improvement Company; thence with the lands of said Company and J. B. Muse to Tinker Creek; thence south with said creek to the bridge of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company over Tinker Creek to the beginning." On June 18th, 1882, the Shenandoah Valley Railroad was completed and on the following day the first train passed over the line from Hagerstown, Maryland, to Roanoke. Roanoke Incorporated as a City On January 31st, 1884, by an act of the Legislature, Roanoke was incorporated as a city, the population at that time being over five thousand, and John H. Dunstan was chosen as the first Mayor under the new charter, with a City Council consisting of twelve members. A meeting of the citizens had been held on January 18th, at which time the result of an enumeration showed a population of five thousand two hundred and seventy-six, and on motion a committee composed of Thomas M. Wood, M. C. Thomas and William Gordon Robertson was appointed to prepare a charter, in order that the town of Roanoke could be incorporated as a city. On January 31st, 1890, the city limits were again extended by an act of the Legislature as follows:— "Beginning at the intersection of the present corporate line with the road leading to Colonel Tayloe's residence; thence along said road to the eastern corner of the lands of the Belmont Land Company; thence with the southeastern boundary line of the same; and continuing same course through the land of the Roanoke Land and Improvement Company to the middle of Roanoke River; thence up the river along the middle of same to the old ford above the iron bridge; thence along Franklin Road to the present corporation line at Gish's road gate; thence with the present line of the Lewis farm, now enclosed, in a westerly direction to the Gish land; thence with the line between said Lewis and Gish lands to the middle of Roanoke River; thence up the river along center line of same to the western boundary of Roanoke Iron Company's land; thence along same and crossing the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad to north boundary of said road; thence along north side of said railroad land to the Sexton farm; thence with western boundary of said farm to the Salem turnpike, at the southwest corner of lands of the Melrose Land Company; thence with the western and northern boundary line of said Company's land to the Salem turnpike and present corporation line; thence with present corporation line to the Linwood tract; thence with western and northern boundary line of same and crossing the Shenandoah Valley Railroad to Tinker Creek; thence down the same to present corporation line; thence with same to the beginning." Early Progress of the City Following the incorporation of Roanoke as a city a Hustings Court was inaugurated and William Gordon Robertson was elected as the first Judge of this Court. In August, 1881, prior to the completion of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad to Roanoke, the Roanoke Land and Improvement Company was formed, and land was purchased and laid off into lots which sold at that time at prices ranging from $100 to $500. In fact one acre of the land that is embraced in the section through which Salem Avenue runs from Jefferson street to Commerce street, was sold to William Routt by John Trout for the sum of $500. The first great industry established was the Roanoke Machine Works in 1882, with a capital of $5,000,000, employing at that time about one thousand men. The building of this plant and the erection of houses by the Roanoke Land and Improvement Company gave an impetus to business of every character, and substantial and rapid growth resulted. This was checked in some degree during 1884 when a general business depression prevailed, but the shops secured a contract from the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad for the building of five hundred freight cars, which enabled them to continue work and thereby relieve the local situation. History of Roanoke City This period of depression was succeeded by one of steady progress, and among the industries which were soon established were the Crozer Iron Company's Furnace, the Norwich Lock Works, Duval Engine Works, Bridgewater Carriage Works, American Bridge Works, Rorer Iron Works, West End Furnace and numerous other enterprises representing various classes of industry. Territorial Limits again Extended By an act of the Legislature approved February 12th, 1892, a new charter was granted the city of Roanoke and the boundary lines were defined as follows:— "Beginning at the intersection of the present corporation line with the road leading to Colonel Tayloe's residence; thence along said road to the eastern corner of the lands of the Belmont Land Company; thence with the southeastern boundary line of same and continuing same course through the land of the Roanoke Land and Improvement Company to the south bank of the Roanoke River; thence up the river with the south bank thereof to the western boundary line of the Roanoke Iron Company's land; thence along same and across the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad to the northern boundary of said road; thence along the northern side of said railroad land to the Sexton farm; thence with the western boundary of said farm to the Salem turnpike, at the southwestern corner of the land of the Melrose Land Company; thence with the northern and western boundary lines of said Company's land to the Salem turnpike and present corporation line; thence with present corporation line to the Linwood tract; thence with the western and northern boundary of same and crossing the Shenandoah Valley Railroad to Tinker Creek; thence down said creek to the present corporation line; thence with the same to the beginning." This charter also made provision for a board of public works, a police justice, a city auditor, and also placed the power of veto in the hands of the Mayor. "Boom" Days To one who has never lived in a town which was undergoing a process of development commonly termed a "boom," the general conditions obtaining at such times are scarcely conceivable. The haste and bustle, promiscuous buying and selling, quick changes in ownership of property, with the feverish excitement prevailing, all attest the fact that the place is on a "boom." During 1882 Roanoke experienced its first period of rapid development, the second occurring in 1885 and the last in 1889. Each of these years marked the beginning of a condition of affairs when land companies were organized almost daily, large tracts laid off into town lots, store-houses and dwellings erected in all parts of the city, with speculation in real estate the dominant feature of all business transactions. As late as 1891, Salem Avenue had no permanent paving, and it was a common thing to see vehicles during rainy weather traveling hub deep in the mud of the street. The Volunteer Fire Company found it necessary at times to use the sidewalk on Salem Avenue to haul their two-wheeled hand hose reel on account of the condition of the street. This, in fact, was the general state of affairs prevailing throughout the city, as speculation in town lots was made without regard for present or prospective improvements; the sole object seeming to be that of buying property, and disposing promptly at an increased price. Values during these "boom" periods were consequently inflated beyond all reason, and when the inevitable reaction occurred, many who had "overloaded" with unimproved real estate were forced to sell at sacrifice prices and often had deficiency judgments entered against them. These serious changes in realty values necessarily affected business conditions during the process of adjustment, and for many years there was a feeling of uncertainty and a lack of confidence in the stability of Roanoke institutions that interfered in some degree with the substantial progress of the city. Furthermore, for many years the population of Roanoke was of a migratory character, and the people did not as a rule own their own homes. Beginning with 1904 the building permits showed a marked increase over previous records, and from that date the upbuilding of the city and the erection of comfortable homes (owned in most instances by the occupants), have progressed on a scale which has not only elicited favorable comment from visitors, but has been viewed with surprise and gratification by the citizens themselves. Values are now permanent, and the financial condition of the city and the stability of its institutions are a guaranty that investments in Roanoke property are safe, and a satisfactory income assured. Further Progress of the City From 1882 when the Roanoke Machine Works were established in the city, the history of Roanoke presents an unbroken record of expansion and progress in all channels of trade, manufacturing and general development. There were, of course, periods of depression, some of which were caused by conditions that affected business throughout the whole country, and it was only to be expected that Roanoke would suffer therefrom in common with other communities; but the panic of 1891 to '93 did not seriously retard the progress of the city, nor did that of 1906-'07, which in many quarters was so disastrous in its effects. It is a notable fact that while banks in many other cities resorted to the issue of scrip during the depression History of Roanoke City in 1907, the financial institutions of Roanoke paid currency or coin at all times. Following the merging of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad with the Norfolk &amp; Western and the construction of branch lines of the company reaching out through the vast coal and mineral deposits of West Virginia, the city continued to grow in importance, as wholesale houses made this point headquarters on account of the excellent transportation facilities afforded. Roanoke, in common with many other cities throughout the country, passed through several experiences usually designated as "booms," and that of 1889-90 was the last which caused any disturbance of values or necessitated a serious readjustment of affairs. It has often been remarked that a singular incident caused the citizens of Roanoke who were investing largely in real estate to take cognizance of actual conditions and call a halt in over-speculation. During the night of December 16th, 1890, snow began to fall, and by morning it had reached a depth of thirty-seven inches, something unprecedented in the history of the city. The streets and roads were practically impassable for a time, as much moisture had fallen with the snow, making it unusually heavy. People were busily engaged in removing the snow from the roofs of houses, several of which caved in, among them the roof of a livery stable and that of the blacksmith shop at the Roanoke Machine Works, where a man was killed. Business was practically suspended, so far as real estate transactions were concerned, and for several days people had an opportunity to "take stock," with the result that the boom collapsed, and a readjustment of values followed. The Decennial Celebration During the month of June, 1892, the "Decennial Celebration" was held, commemorating the tenth anniversary of the changing of the name of Big Lick to that of Roanoke and the location of the Roanoke Machine Works in this city. This was a gala day for Roanoke, and was an occasion of much enthusiasm and interest. There was a street parade with floats representing various classes of trade, secret orders in full regalia, and employees of the Roanoke Machine Works in uniform, representing the several departments of this great enterprise. The parade was reviewed from the Norfolk &amp; Western office building by Frederick J. Kimball, President of the road. There were also entertainments of various kinds, speech-making, and a general celebration commensurate with the progress already achieved and the brilliant prospects for the city's future. Building of the Roanoke &amp; Southern Railroad During the Fall of 1886, John C. Moomaw of Roanoke County rode over the line from Roanoke to Greenville, N. C., enlisting the interest and support of various communities in the project of building a new line of railway. These efforts culminated in a mass meeting which was held in Roanoke in the Spring of 1887, when the Roanoke &amp; Southern Company was formed. Delegations from various localities were in attendance, and presented their claims and advantages to the directory which had been chosen for the new organization. D. F. Houston was president of the new company and among the directors were H. S. Trout, P. L. Terry, S. W. Jamison, John C. Moomaw, E. H. Stewart and Jas. S. Simmons. Among others who were actively engaged in the work of bringing the road to Roanoke were T. T. Fishburne, J. W. Boswell, R. A. Buckner, J. F. Wingfield, H. Q. Nicholson, R. H. Woodrum, L. L. Powell, R. H. Gray, Herbert J. Browne, J. A. Pugh and Dr. J. D. Kirk. Shortly after this meeting the Roanoke &amp; Southern of North Carolina was formed with F. H. Fries, President, and R. J. Reynolds, J. W. Hanes, W. A. Lemly, C. B. Watson, J. W. Fries, C. H. Fogle and others as directors. These two corporations were subsequently consolidated, and D. F. Houston was elected president, the united boards constituting the directory. The work of construction was begun in the county of Henry by using convict labor, but it soon became evident that the work could not be completed in this way, and the Virginia-North Carolina Construction Company was formed during the Fall of 1887. This company contracted to build the line for the subscriptions and assets of the Roanoke &amp; Southern Railroad. F. H. Fries was made President of the Construction Company, and it was planned to build the road in three sections: Section A being from Winston-Salem to Martinsville, Section B from Martinsville to Roanoke, and Section C from Winston-Salem south to some point on the Seaboard Air Line. Throughout the next four years the work of construction progressed, and the line was completed from Winston-Salem to Roanoke, a distance of one hundred and twenty-two miles, in January, 1892. Before the completion of the road, Col. D. F. Houston's death occurred, and Henry S. Trout succeeded him as President of the Roanoke &amp; Southern Railroad, and acted in that capacity, with S. W. Jamison as Secretary and Treasurer, until the road was acquired by the Norfolk &amp; Western. The Roanoke &amp; Southern Railroad was opened for traffic between Winston-Salem and Roanoke in March, 1892, and was almost immediately leased to the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad. It eventually became the Winston-Salem Division of the Norfolk &amp; Western System, and in 1910, the connecting link from Winston-Salem to Wadesboro on History of Roanoke City the Atlantic Coast Line was completed, this last portion of the work being done through the joint action of the Norfolk &amp; Western and Seaboard Air Line. The present Winston-Salem Southbound Railway is the Section C projected by the men who planned the building of the Roanoke &amp; Southern in 1886, and is the connecting link of a great trunk line of railway from Columbus, Ohio, to Charleston, S. C. The importance of this new link of ninety miles from Winston-Salem to Wadesboro cannot be overestimated, as it completes an air-line from the great Pocahontas coal fields of West Virginia to the port of Charleston, and furnishes an additional outlet for an ever-increasing supply of the world's best grade of steam coal. It also shortens the haul for fruits and early vegetables from southern points to Roanoke and adds to the importance of this city as a distributing point for farm products of every description. The men who devoted their time and means to the work of making possible the building of the Roanoke &amp; Southern Railroad performed a signal service for the city of Roanoke, and deserve credit for the foresight and energy displayed in an undertaking which resulted in lasting benefit to the community. Military Companies Enlisted During Spanish-American War, 1898 During the Spanish-American War Roanoke City placed two companies of infantry at the service of the country. Company F of the 2d Virginia Infantry, U. S. Volunteers, was commanded by Captain Robert F. Taylor, with James O. B. Palmer, First Lieutenant, and Homer G. Hogan, Second Lieutenant. Company G of the 2d Virginia Infantry, U. S. Volunteers, was commanded by Captain Ballard P. Hatcher, with William R. Engleby, First Lieutenant, and John W. Hancock, Second Lieutenant. Company F was mustered into the United States service May 12th, 1898, and mustered out of the United States service December 15th, 1898, one hundred officers and men. Company G was mustered into the United States service May 11th, 1898, and mustered out of the United States service December 15th, 1898, one hundred and four officers and men. The Virginian Railway Built Through Roanoke In the early part of 1905 engineers in charge of the work of surveying the line of the Virginian Railway from Deepwater to the coast, came to Roanoke after having made several preliminary surveys, one of which ran the line through the city just north of the Roanoke River. They were met by the citizens of Roanoke who showed a most cordial spirit toward the project to build the tracks of the new company through the city limits, and were assured of coöperation in the matter of securing a right of way at a fair cost. The city government granted a free right of way through property owned by the city on the route along the north bank of the Roanoke River, which enabled the Virginian line to enter the corporate limits. An agreement was entered into and signed by business men and other citizens guaranteeing that the cost of the right of way of the road through private property should not exceed the sum of $40,000, and on the strength of this guaranty the road was built through the city, the line running just inside its southern boundary. This evidence of public spirit on the part of Roanoke's progressive citizens secured the second through line of railroad and added materially to the transportation facilities of the city. After the completion of the road, which was built by Henry H. Rogers, a party of its officers, headed by Mr. Rogers, made an inspection of the line from Sewall's Point to its western terminal. While on this tour of inspection the party was tendered a reception by the citizens of Roanoke as a mark of their appreciation of what had been done for the city by the Virginian Railway in the building of its line through the corporate limits. This inspection of the line by Mr. Rogers took place shortly before his death. A division shop and round-house have been established in Roanoke, employing quite a number of men, and a handsome passenger depot and a commodious freight station have been erected in the southern part of the city. Progress Since 1892 When the "Decennial Celebration" was held in 1892 the population of the city was probably eighteen thousand, and those who participated were sanguine as to the city's future. It is doubtful, however, if many who were present on that occasion believed that in the brief space of eighteen years the census would show that the population of Roanoke had doubled. During the years which have passed, the city's progress has been rapid and substantial in every line of material development. Streets have been permanently improved, the matter of sanitation has received especial attention and several public parks have been established. The public-service corporations have kept pace with the city's growth by supplying necessary transportation, lighting, water and gas, 'phone service, and telegraph facilities. New lines of railway have entered the city, the manufacturing interests have increased in marked degree, the wholesale and retail trade has grown almost phenomenally, and prosperity is apparent in every branch of business. History of Roanoke City When the project to establish a great National Highway from New York to Atlanta was taken up by the New York Herald and the Atlanta Journal, the proposition was welcomed by the citizens of Roanoke, who entered into the work aggressively, with the result that the city was designated as the half-way point on the route. This caused the building in this city of some of the largest and best equipped automobile garages in the State, and assisted in creating a sentiment which led to the building of better roads throughout the country adjacent to Roanoke. Several years ago an organization was formed in Roanoke by the ladies of the city, known as the "Woman's Civic Betterment Club." To these devoted women is due in large measure the progress which the city has made in the acquisition of land for public parks, the increase in school facilities, better sanitation, cleanliness and orderly keeping of private premises, the abatement of dust and dirt nuisances on the streets, and the inculcation of higher ideals in many phases of city life. Their coöperation in work for Roanoke's uplift and welfare has been of signal service to the community, and the part they have taken in the general scheme of development work is worthy of the highest praise. Much of Roanoke's progress is due to the spirit of coöperation which animates her citizens when dealing with questions of public moment; the city authorities and the various commercial and labor organizations acting in unison in matters concerning the welfare of the city. The statistical information contained in the statements pertaining to the building permits issued, the annual record of real and personal property valuation, the bonded indebtedness of the city, and other data concerning municipal matters, all attest the splendid strides that have been made. This general information, with a description and history of Roanoke's leading institutions, is given under appropriate headings in a succeeding portion of this work. There is also a section devoted to biographical sketches of the men who have been identified in various capacities with the upbuilding of the city. The Roanoke of to-day is the result of commercial coöperation, the utilization of opportunities, and the concentration of effort for the material development of the city. Proud of her past accomplishments, conscious of her natural advantages, resourceful and vigorous in her undertakings, she is the embodiment of energy and progress—a queenly municipality, crowned with the well-earned prestige of notable achievements, and destined to occupy a commanding position among the progressive cities of the land. Her people are working for Roanoke's further advancement along comprehensive lines, and with confidence inspired by supreme faith in her future greatness. THE ROANOKE OF TO=DAY Location, Temperature, Environments and Advantages. The city is situated in the Roanoke Valley of Virginia, at its junction with the famous Shenandoah Valley, the Roanoke River flowing along its southern border. To the Southeast are the Blue Ridge Mountains, and on the Northwest are the Alleghanies. From this ideal location the cold winds of winter are tempered, and during the summer the humidity is always below the average. A cooling breeze invariably sweeps down from the northwest hills at night-fall, insuring comfort and invigorating rest. The city's altitude is nine hundred and seven feet. It is situated in Latitude thirty-seven degrees fifteen minutes North and Longitude seventy-nine degrees fifteen minutes West, or about on a plane with southern Spain. The temperature rarely rises above ninety degrees in midsummer, while the winters are generally marked by an absence of snow or excessive cold. The climate is equable, severe frosts being of rare occurrence. The average mean temperature is fifty-five degrees, and the average rainfall forty-four inches per year. The environments of the city are exceptionally beautiful, the rolling nature of the country and the adjacent mountains affording a pleasing scene for the eye to rest upon in whichever direction the traveler may journey. Epidemics are absolutely unknown, and the locality is especially free from sickness; Roanoke's ideal location, high altitude, fine sanitation, and unexcelled water supply combining to make the city a most healthful place for residence. The death rate during recent years according to mortuary statistics furnished by the City authorities, has been only fourteen to the one thousand inhabitants. These figures include deaths occurring at the several hospitals to which patients are brought from a large surrounding district, and where railway employees from several divisions centering at this point are brought for treatment when injured. The streets are well paved or macadamized, and the city is lighted throughout by electricity. Every section is supplied with storm-water drains and sanitary sewers; extensive public improvements having been made in recent years from the proceeds of bond issues. These improvements were made necessary by the continuous development in all parts of the city. A first-class telephone service meets all local requirements and furnishes long-distance connection with every section of the country. Both the Western Union and the Postal Telegraph Companies have lines entering Roanoke, thereby placing the city in close communication with every part of the civilized world. The water supply of Roanoke is one of the great blessings enjoyed by the community, and from the standpoint of health its importance cannot be overestimated. From the solid rock at the base of Mill Mountain, a spur of the Blue Ridge about one-half mile southeast of the city, bursts forth the famous Crystal Spring, with a never-ceasing flow of cool, sparkling water, supplying five million gallons per day. The temperature of the water as it issues from the spring is fifty-two degrees. The water of other large mountain springs has been STRICKLAND BUILDING made available for future use, to meet the requirements of the city when needed. Besides this supply, a freestone water, excellently adapted to and largely used for manufacturing purposes as well as domestic use, is piped from Bedford County. This water is also largely used for boilers of locomotives and stationary engines, as it is peculiarly satisfactory for such purposes. Roanoke is in close proximity to a number of the noted mineral springs of Virginia, whose curative properties are renowned throughout the whole country. Among those which are accessible by a few hours' ride, or less, are the Blue Ridge Springs, Coyner's Springs, Yellow Sulphur, Alleghany Springs, White Sulphur, History of Roanoke City Crocketts, Roanoke Red Sulphur, Hot Springs, and the famous Greenbrier White Sulphur. The Peaks of Otter, Weyer's Cave, Caverns of Luray, and the great Natural Bridge of Virginia are all within a few hours' ride from Roanoke. The various Secret Orders are well represented, have large membership, and their personnel is of a high character. There are also a number of social clubs, prominent among which are the Shenandoah, Elks' Club, Eagles' JEFFERSON STREET SOUTH FROM SALEM AVENUE Club, Roanoke Country Club, Blue Ridge Gun Club and the Roanoke German Club. The city has several large and well-equipped Opera Houses, which in point of architectural construction and seating capacity compare favorably with those found in cities of much larger size. Illuminating and fuel gas, which is of a uniform standard of eighteen candle-power, is furnished at a moderate cost, and in many residences gas is used as a fuel, particularly throughout the summer months. The city has an admirable system of electric car service, with well-equipped cars of the latest pattern, affording ample facilities and rapid transportation to all parts of the city, as well as to adjoining towns. The company operating the street railway system has adopted a policy which enabled it to keep pace with the city's requirements, and much of the line is double-tracked. The road-bed, track, and equipment generally are kept in a high state of efficiency. An electric freight service is operated, cars being run to the neighboring towns of Salem and Vinton. This Company also owns a large dam situated at a point on the Roanoke River about three and one-half miles from this city, built of solid concrete, forty-five feet high by four hundred and seventy-five feet in length and fifty feet in thickness. This dam, in conjunction with the Company's central power plant, enables them to sell power at a rate attractive to manufacturing concerns, many of which have abandoned steam power for electricity. Population. The population of the city at the time of its incorporation History of Roanoke City January 31st, 1884, was five thousand two hundred and seventy-six. The United States Census of 1890 gave Roanoke sixteen thousand one hundred and fifty-nine population, that of 1900 specified twenty-one thousand four hundred and ninety-five, while the last census taken in 1910 showed thirty-four thousand eight hundred and seventy-four. Including the suburban population of Crystal Spring, Ghent, Virginia Heights, Norwich and Vinton, these figures will easily reach forty thousand, which is a fair estimate of the population at the close of 1911. Manufacturing While the manufacturing interests of Roanoke have not yet assumed the proportions they are destined to reach at no remote time, there has been a gradual increase from year to year, especially during the past decade, as transportation facilities and the building of new lines of railway have attracted the attention of ROANOKE RIVER manufacturers to Roanoke as a distributing point for all classes of merchandise and manufactured articles, as well as a place where cheap power and efficient labor could be obtained. The Roanoke Machine Works where the heavy repairs are made to engines and cars of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway, and where a portion of the company's rolling stock is built, is the largest industry in the city. There are also two bridge companies, several large planing mills, flouring mills, two ice plants, a large brewery, several bottling works, two blast furnaces, two overall factories, one iron works, three marble works, a fertilizer factory, a metal culvert factory, a cotton mill, a box factory, one packing house, several large printing houses and book binderies, a barrel and stave factory, one extract and proprietary remedy manufactory, an enamel-ware factory, an aerial tramway manufactory, several sash, door and blind factories, a sheet metal manufactory, a candy factory, several cigar factories, as well as numerous smaller industries. Wholesale Trade Roanoke is recognized as an important distributing point for all classes of merchandise. Situated at the gateway of Southwest Virginia, in close proximity to and in direct communication with the Virginia and West Virginia coal fields, which are reached by two lines of railway, merchants engaged in the wholesale business find Roanoke an exceptionally advantageous point from which to reach their trade. The result of these conditions is that firms and companies have been established here with ample facilities to meet competition from the larger trade centers East and North, and the amount of wholesale business shows annually a steady increase in volume. Retail Trade The retail stores of Roanoke carry as full and attractive lines of merchandise as are to be found in any city of the size in the country. They are lighted in nearly every instance with electricity and are fitted up with all modern furnishings and conveniences. The retail merchants of the city are progressive and their places of business are conducted in an up-to-date, courteous and business-like manner. In addition to the large local business enjoyed, the city is the natural trading point for a rich agricultural district, as well as for adjoining towns which are connected with Roanoke by electric lines. The Roanoke Machine Works and Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Offices The first great industry established in the city of Roanoke was the Roanoke Machine Works in 1882 with a capital of $5,000,000. This is one of the largest car and locomotive manufacturing plants in the South and gives employment to two thousand five hundred men. When the shops were first established they gave employment to nearly a thousand men, most of whom were skilled mechanics, and their coming started the building of numbers of houses for the occupancy of the families of these men. The building of these shops and the installation of their equipment placed the general business conditions of the city on a solid foundation and its progress from that time was assured. Many important additions have been added to these works since their erection in 1882 and the immense plant now covers over sixty acres of ground. Among the important improvements are a large foundry, one hundred and forty by seven hundred and forty feet in size, for the manufacture of wheels, soft iron castings and brass and bronze work. Also a new storage building sixty-three by eighty-two feet for paint, stock, etc., and an addition for storage of History of Roanoke City lime, salt, cement, etc., fifty-three by one hundred and thirty-nine feet in size, and an extension to the passenger car paint shop measuring seventy-four by one hundred and fifty-one feet. There is also operated at this plant a large frog and switch shop in which is built the Maintenance of Way equipment for the system. The maximum yearly output of the huge new foundry is one hundred and twenty-five thousand car wheels and three million pounds of gray castings. CAMPBELL AVENUE WEST FROM JEFFERSON STREET There were also added about five years ago two new classifying yards of large dimensions and a new twenty-stall round house and machine shop at an outlay of over $1,000,000. The other new buildings and machinery mentioned cost $750,000. The Company's general offices are located in Roanoke and these comprise two handsome structures situated in the heart of the city and are model buildings of their kind. They are six stories in height, built of brick and cost $250,000. About eight hundred clerks and officials are employed in these offices. The new passenger station at this point is one of the handsomest and most commodious buildings of the kind in the South, and was constructed at a cost of $125,000. A tract of land located near the wholesale section of the city is owned by the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company, the cost of which was $75,000, and on this will be erected a new brick freight station with team tracks for city business. When completed this will be one of the finest structures of the kind in the South. Since 1896 the bulk of the erecting and heavy repair work of the Company has been handled at the Roanoke Machine works and the pay roll averages $125,000 monthly. When the total number of men in the employ of the Company is considered, including clerks and trainmen who make their homes in this city, they will aggregate five thousand and the amount of money paid this force monthly will approximate $300,000 or over $3,500,000 annually. The Daily Press There are published in Roanoke three daily newspapers—The History of Roanoke City Roanoke Times, The Evening World and The Evening News, which rank among the foremost journals of the country. Their columns reflect the spirit of progressiveness which pervades the entire community, and these publications have large circulation, not only locally but throughout the entire southwestern section of the State and the West Virginia coal fields. The subject matter contained in their columns is well prepared, and the editorials are of a high character, SECOND PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH denoting care and intelligent consideration of the topics treated, forceful in expression, and of commanding influence in shaping public opinion on the issues of the times. Churches and Charities Within the corporate limits of Roanoke are twenty-seven churches for the accommodation of the white population and ten churches for the colored people. The white churches are composed of the following denominations:—Presbyterian, four; Methodist, seven; Baptist, five; United Brethren, two; Christian, two; Lutheran, one; Roman Catholic, one, Reformed, one. The ten colored churches are divided among the Baptist, Presbyterian, Methodist and Christian denominations. Some of the buildings are among the handsomest and most commodious in the State. A strong spirit of coöperation exists among the pastors of the several churches, who meet in a Minister's Conference at regular stated periods, for the purpose of divising such plans as will tend to the advancement of the spiritual welfare of the community. A like broad spirit is manifested by the membership of the various churches, the supreme desire being that of rendering mutual assistance and carrying on in the best possible manner the noble work in which they are engaged. The Young Men's Christian Association has a large and energetic membership, composed of representative young men. Its directory comprises many of the leading business and professional men of the city. The building occupied is one of the best appointed and equipped of its kind in the State, centrally located, and easily accessible to the young men who form so large a part of Roanoke's population. The people of Roanoke are noted for charity, benevolence and care of the afflicted. It is only necessary that a case of need be made known ST. ANDREW'S CATHOLIC CHURCH to awaken sympathy and enlist substantial aid. In addition to the care which cach church gives its needy and helpless members, the work of the churches has crystallized in a body known as the Charity Organization Society, the Superintendent of which is supported by the churches; its work being managed by an advisory board appointed by the Ministers' Conference. The supplies for the prosecution of the work of this History of Roanoke City organization are furnished by the benevolent people of the city, and come in the shape of contributions of money, fuel, clothes and food. So broad and efficient is the nature of the work carried on by this organization that no one need suffer if his needy condition be made known. GREENE-MEMORIAL CHURCH Educational Advantages The school facilities and general educational advantages afforded by a city are always matters of prime consideration to parents who contemplate removal to a new community, as these advantages are an almost infallible index to the social and material progress of a city. Well provided with schools herself, Roanoke is within easy reach of institutions of higher learning, which offer the finest opportunities to secure a liberal education. The public school system of Roanoke is conceded to be one of the best in the State and is certainly the pride of the city. The buildings are modern, well arranged and provided with excellent equipment. Each school is in charge of a principal, who is assisted by a corps of well-trained and experienced teachers. The course of study covers seven sessions of nine months each and embraces all the regular primary and grammar grade branches. The work of these schools is careful and thorough, and discipline of a high order is maintained. At the head of the system is the High School and the faculty of this institution is composed largely of specialists. The regular course covers four sessions, affording instruction in English, Mathematics, History, Latin, Modern Languages, Science and Commercial branches. The school has scholarships to the University of Virginia, Washington and Lee University, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Richmond College, Virginia Institute and Western Reserve University, to which institutions and to Cornell University, graduates are admitted without examinations. The following comparison will show the increase in the staff of teachers, the pupils in attendance and the amount expended by the School Board for tuition. Session 1903-'4 Teachers:—White, 69; Colored, 12; Total, 81. Pupils:—White, 3,252; Colored, 1,142; Total, 4,394. Amount paid for Teachers' Salaries, $31,929.62. Session 1910-'11 Teachers:—White, 126, Colored, 25, Total, 151. Pupils:—White, 5,126, Colored, 1,267, Total, 6,393. Amount paid for Teachers' Salaries, $83,257.84. Besides there is a night school, conducted in the High School building, where ten of the corps of regular teachers are also regularly employed in giving tuition to night scholars. The system is composed of one High School, one intermediate school, six white and two colored grammar schools, with a total enrollment of six thousand three hundred and ninety-three scholars, not including the number who receive instruction at the night school. PARK STREET SCHOOL Since 1903 the following additions have been made to the school buildings of the city in order to meet the growing educational requirements of Roanoke's increasing population. Park School building erected and opened for scholars September, 1907. This building contains fourteen class rooms with a seating capacity of forty-five each. Eight rooms with a seating capacity of forty-five each added to Belmont School. Five rooms of same size were added to the Gilmer Avenue School, six of same capacity added to Melrose History of Roanoke City School, six of similar size to the West End School and four of like capacity to the Commerce Street School. There were also added to the High School six additional class rooms with a seating capacity of forty-five each and a study hall with accommodations for three hundred students. To the Gainsborough Colored School were added four rooms and to the Gregory Avenue Colored School, four, each with capacity for seating forty-five pupils. These improvements, which have been made since 1907, cost in round figures $122,000 and with renovating and remodeling of the buildings amounting to at least $3,000 gives the sum total of $125,000, spent for school improvements during the term mentioned. The Central Grammar School, which is now under construction and will be open for the 1912 term, is located on a tract of land comprising something more NEW CENTRAL GRAMMAR SCHOOL BUILDING than an acre of ground fronting on Commerce Street at its junction with Franklin Road. This is an intermediate school between the primary and the High School and will contain twenty-nine class rooms above the basement, with a seating capacity of forty to forty-five each. There are also in this building the Superintendent's office, Teachers' rest room, and an Assembly Hall with a seating capacity of eleven hundred. In the basement are a large gymnasium, a Domestic Science room twenty-two by fifty-six feet in size, and a Manual Training room size twenty-two by fifty-six feet. The entire building will be wired for electric lighting, and heated by what is known as the Hot Blast Furnace System, whereby fresh air is carried over the furnace and into the various rooms, in which the temperature is automatically regulated. The latest improvements of every character pertaining to school furnishings and equipment will be installed, and when completed this building will be a model structure of its kind and one of the best in Virginia in point of architectural construction and convenience. It is built of brown stone and concrete, covered with tiling, and the hall floors will be of concrete, with iron and slate stairways. The land on which this handsome structure stands cost the city of Roanoke $18,000, while the building is estimated to cost when completed $95,000, and when furnished the total cost will be approximately $125,000. The vacation school, opened during the summer of 1911, is a further means of adapting the system to the needs of students. Through this school, an opportunity is offered for the brighter pupils to make up a term's work, and for those backward in certain branches, to have coach work. This school acts as a means of adjustment to all new pupils and as a sort of clearing house for those already in the system. Virginia College for young ladies is situated one-half mile from the city on a beautiful elevation, with a commanding view of the Blue Ridge and Alleghany mountains. The College is within casy access to the city by means of electric cars, and students are enabled to enjoy the advantages of country life combined with the conveniences of a city. The school is conducted according to the most advanced methods of education, special attention being given to English, Art, Music and Sciences. The buildings are of brick with slate roofs and are constructed after the most approved style of architecture, with special reference to the safety, health and comfort of the students. The college building has a frontage of two hundred and twenty-eight feet, with wings at both ends, and extends back one hundred and six feet. It contains a large auditorium, study hall, dining room, offices, class rooms, etc., and is heated throughout by steam and lighted by electricity. Both in healthfulness of location and in the character of instruction given, this school possesses most excellent advantages and is regarded as one of the leading educational institutions of the State. The National Business College located in this city is one of the best known Commercial Schools in the South. Its faculty is composed of professional teachers of successful experience. Its equipment is modern and affords every facility for acquainting students with actual business affairs. The curriculum is comprehensive and thorough. The patronage of the College is drawn from most of the Southern States and the prestige of the institution has created a demand for graduates from its course of instruction. One of the most widely known institutions in the South for young ladies is Hollins College, located about seven miles from Roanoke. For over half a century this school has held a most prominent position in the field of education for women, History of Roanoke City its name being a synonym for culture and refinement. The buildings range around the three sides of a triangle and are commodious and well provided with every means for comfort and utility. The large faculty of instructors is selected from the great universities and colleges of this country and Europe. Courses of study are offered in classical, scientific and ornamental branches, the curriculum being broad and varied enough to provide appropriate studies for the taste or talent of every student. Roanoke College, a well-known institution of learning, is located at Salem, about seven miles from Roanoke, the two places being connected by an electric line. The course of study leading up to the Degree of Bachelor of Arts, extends through four years and embraces Ancient and Modern Languages, Sciences, Hygiene, Higher Mathematics, Psychology, Ethics and English Language and Literature. The College has an able faculty which includes writers of well-known text books. Many of the professors have done post-graduate service at various European universities. The lecture-room, laboratories and museum are commodious and well arranged. The College library contains about twenty-five thousand volumes, among which are many rare works now out of print. The institution is well prepared to furnish excellent facilities for young men in the field of higher education. Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Virginia Military Institute, the University of Virginia, and Washington and Lee University are all located within a few hours' journey from Roanoke. Hospitals Within the city limits are several private hospitals, and situated on the foot-hills of Mill Mountain is Roanoke Hospital, which is maintained largely by public contributions. These institutions rank with those of a similar character in any city of like size in the South, and every requisite is afforded that will contribute to the speedy recovery of the injured or afflicted. The excellent attention given by management, attending physicians, and well-trained nurses and assistants, has established for these institutions the reputation of doing everything possible for the relief and comfort of patients. The Great Roanoke Fair Annual meetings of the Great Roanoke Fair have been held in each September since 1903. As Roanoke is centrally located in a rich agricultural district and possesses splendid transportation facilities, exceptional opportunities are afforded for assembling at this point exhibits of all descriptions. The race-course is conceded to be one of the finest and fastest half-mile tracks in the South. Southwest Virginia is famous for the fine breeds of cattle raised, and the stock exhibited at these fairs always attracts attention. The apple exhibit is one of the most prominent features, as some of the finest varieties of apples in the world are raised in this immediate neighborhood. Financial Probably no better criterion can be cited indicating the city's progress than a comparison from year to year of the financial statements of Roanoke's banking institutions. The statistics are as follows, and are a summary of the statements of the three National Banks and one State Bank engaged in business. Year No. Banks Capital Surplus Deposits 1900 2 $ 200,000 $ 95,000 $1,288,043 1905 3 225,000 116,537 2,453,229 1906 3 350,000 312,248 3,194,620 1907 4 600,000 432,129 4,639,436 1908 4 800,000 593,706 4,657,182 1909 4 800,000 631,047 4,648,562 1910 4 850,000 653,764 5,690,481 1911 4 1,200,000 1,011,353 6,691,319 Statistics compiled by the Treasury Department at Washington show the following increases in National Bank deposits from June 23d, 1909, to June 7th, 1911. In the United States 11.8% In Southern States 21.3% In Virginia 29.16% In Roanoke 38.2% These institutions, as evidenced by the foregoing statistics, have shown a steady growth and have afforded banking facilities in keeping with the city's development. They are managed with care and conservatism, and the interests of stockholders and patrons are guarded in every particular. Roanoke's banks have never suspended specie payments during any period of depression, and no scrip has ever been issued. They are regarded as among the soundest financial institutions in the State, and their showing is indicative of the general prosperity prevailing in all classes of business in the city. Chamber of Commerce In January, 1904, the Chamber of Commerce of Roanoke was organized, the old Board of Trade and the Merchants' and Manufacturers' Association merging into the new organization. Its membership of five hundred is composed of the leading business and professional men of the city, and the systematic work which it has conducted has given a History of Roanoke City strong impetus to the upbuilding of Roanoke, and the advancement of the business interests of the city. This organization has taken part in many matters of prime civic concern, and has been of influence in bringing some important public questions to a successful termination. Its policy of mutual help and commercial coöperation has contributed in large measure to the material development which is apparent in every phase of the city's activities. A monthly publication entitled "Roanoke" is issued by the Chamber of Commerce, and presents a current record of the progress of the city, with such information as will tend to advertise the advantages of Roanoke as a manufacturing point and place of residence. Retail Merchants' Association Roanoke has a strong organization composed of practically every retail merchant, the objects being to bring together the membership for the promotion of their mutual welfare, and to establish a feeling of good-fellowship in all business dealings. General protection in the matter of credit extended their local trade is one of the prominent features of the work. The benefit derived through associations of this character has been demonstrated, and the local organization is one of the strongest and most progressive in the State. Market Facilities and Supply The City Market House is centrally located in a large open space known as "Market Square," and here are offered for sale farm products from a large surrounding territory. The city is fortunately situated in regard to its agricultural surroundings, as it is in the center of the rich and fertile Roanoke Valley. Contiguous thereto, and within easy reach are the counties of Botetourt, Bedford, Franklin, Floyd and Montgomery, which for diversity of soil and variety of product cannot be surpassed in any section of the country. The soil as a rule is a rich, loamy, chocolate clay on which can be grown a variety of crops. It is particularly adapted to the cultivation of wheat, Indian corn, hay, buckwheat, barley and rye, as well as vegetables of every description. Fruits of all kinds flourish in this locality, and as a result the canning industry has grown to considerable proportions. The business of trucking and gardening has also grown to be an important factor in the farming industry in this vicinity, and residents of Roanoke, can always be assured of procuring fresh vegetables and other farm products at the City Market. The reputation of apples raised in this locality has become international. The famous Bent Mountain Pippin is purchased extensively for export trade, its delicate flavor and fine keeping qualities making it a specially desirable fruit for long-distance shipment, as well as for home consumption. Within the past ten years thousands of acres of fruit trees have been planted, and fruit culture is becoming an important branch of farming throughout this section. MARKET SCENE Hotel Facilities The advantages offered by Roanoke in the way of hotel facilities are exceptional. The hotels of the city are commodious and well kept, and are able to take care of a large transient business. State conventions of various kinds are frequently held in Roanoke on account of the excellent hotel facilities. Few cities of the size are so well supplied with hotels equipped with all modern furnishings and conveniences, and able to handle the volume of business that can be taken care of by the hotels of Roanoke. Fire Protection Roanoke has a most efficient paid Fire Department of fifty-five full paid men, and the equipment is complete and first-class in every particular. The commodious central fire station is a model structure of its kind, and is conveniently arranged and complete in every essential, and the other buildings are likewise well equipped. History of Roanoke City The Gamewell Fire Alarm System is used, there being seventy-seven street boxes, twenty-four thousand feet of underground cable, twenty-six miles of overhead number ten copper wire, one-ten circuit repeater, one-ten circuit storage battery and switchboard. There are six fire stations, three of which are equipped with automobile hose wagons, with chemical apparatus. There are three engine companies, equipped with steam fire engines and hose wagons each, which are horse drawn. The discipline maintained is excellent and frequent fire drills are required in order to keep the department in a high state of efficiency. The loss by fire per capita has been unusually low, as is shown by statistics compiled by the National Board of Underwriters. SCENE IN MOUNTAIN PARK Parks and Amusements Roanoke is fortunate in possessing several large tracts of land owned by the city and utilized as public parks. Elmwood Park, which is centrally located, was purchased by the city in the Spring of 1911 for the sum of $150,000. Its grounds are spacious and it is conveniently situated, being easily accessible from all parts of the city, the street car line passing by its Jefferson Street frontage. This property was for many years the home of the Terry family, and is one of the most attractive spots in the city. Highland Park comprises over forty acres and is located in the Southwestern part of the city on the bank of the Roanoke River. This land was dedicated as a park by the city authorities several years ago, and is valued at over $80,000 in the last report issued by the municipal government. Melrose Park, located in the northwestern part of the city, is of smaller dimensions, but is an ideal place for recreation. Besides these three public parks there is Mountain Park owned by the company operating the street railway line, and there is also a pleasure resort on the top of Mill Mountain reached by an incline railway. These various resorts, with their accessories for recreation and amusement, furnish Roanoke's population ample opportunity for out-of-doors recreation. Roanoke's Health Department The rapid increase in Roanoke's population in the last decade necessitated a reorganization of its Health Department, for with the growth of the city a number of sanitary problems have arisen, which could be successfully met only by a modern, well-equipped department of health under the direction of trained sanitarians. Early in 1910 the Council passed an ordinance providing for the creation of such a Health Department, and in August of that year representative men were appointed to the membership of the new Board of Health. Later an appropriation was made for the maintenance of the department, and in November, Dr. W. Brownley Foster of the Richmond Health Department was appointed Health Officer, and still later Mr. Allen Jenkins was appointed Clerk to the department and Mr. B. E. Price, Dairy and Food Inspector. The new Health Department in the first year of its existence has undertaken important new work and has amplified its former activities. Among its accomplishments are the institution of an efficient laboratory in which hundreds of food analyses have been made, besides bacteriological tests for communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, typhoid fever, hookworm disease and malaria. The laboratory has been of great usefulness, and its services are free to citizens of Roanoke. Adequate supervision of the food supplies of the city was a crying need which has been met by the appointment of the Dairy and Food Inspector. Thousands of inspections have been made of restaurants and stores and of the foods sold in them, with a consequent improvement in their sanitary conditions and in the quality of the foods. The important work of dairy inspection was begun in the summer and has been prosecuted for five months with such success that there has been an improvement of twenty-eight and eight-tenths per cent. in the History of Roanoke City average score of the dairies selling milk in Roanoke. This notable result has been accomplished without discord but with the hearty coöperation of the dairymen, all of whom are well disposed toward the Health Department. Such improvement in the milk supply should result in saving the lives of many bottle-fed babies. A modern system of vital statistics has been installed, and the effort to secure complete records of all deaths occurring in the city has met with gratifying success. These records as well as those of births and of contagious diseases are accurately kept in such form as to be readily available for use. They constitute a valuable index to health conditions and will prove a trustworthy guide in future work for the improvement of the health of the city. Efficient work is being done for the control of contagious diseases, though the services of a medical inspector are needed in connection with these diseases, especially in the schools. The first essential was to secure accurate information as to the prevalence of these diseases, and that they are now being reported far more completely than formerly is indicated by the fact in the first month of its work the Health Department secured reports of as many cases of diphtheria as had been reported in the preceding ten months. All cases of contagious disease are quarantined and every effort is made to prevent their spread through schools and other avenues of infection. A movement has been started for the appointment of a medical inspector. The results already accomplished with a modest appropriation and a small force, give promise of brilliant results when more adequate appropriations and additional officers make it possible to extend its present activities and to undertake new lines of work. The department publishes a monthly Bulletin and other literature in the interest of the public health. The membership of the Health Department is as follows:— Board of Health: Joseph W. Coxe, President; S. H. Heironimus; I. E. Huff, M. D.; George B. Lawson, M. D.; John W. Woods. Officers: W. Brownley Foster, M. D., Health Officer; Allen Jenkins, Clerk; B. E. Price, Dairy and Food Inspector; L. R. Hanes, Fumigator; Daniel Horgan, Sanitary Policeman. Municipal Statistics On January 1st, 1910, the Bonded Indebtedness of the city was $1,066,000.00. On March 24th, 1910, the freehold voters of the city voted an issue of bonds to be used for the following purposes:— Streets $285,000.00 Sewers 75,000.00 Public School Buildings 100,000.00 Fire Stations 40,000.00 Total $500,000.00 On May 1st, 1911, a further bond issue was voted upon favorably by the freeholders for the following purposes:— For Public Park $120,000.00 For New City Hall 230,000.00 Total $350,000.00 This makes the total bonded indebtedness $1,916,000.00, and there is in the Sinking Fund to the credit of the bond account the sum of $135,000.00. On January 1st, 1911, the value of public buildings, land and parks (exclusive of the $100,000.00 for public schools and the $40,000.00 for fire stations voted March 24th, 1910) was $693,941.51, of which the Public School buildings represented the sum of $345,943.25. When the items for Public Building and Park included in the last two bond issues are added, the value of public buildings, land and parks will amount to a sum approximating $1,200,000.00. The tax rate which obtains is $1.60 on each $100 of assessed property valuation, based on a fair, conservative estimate of values, and is divided as follows: City Tax, $1.00, School Tax, 25 cents, State Tax, 35 cents, Total, $1.60, which is the lowest tax rate of any city of like size in Virginia. Roanoke has never defaulted in meeting the payments of interest on municipal bonds. The average rate of interest on the present outstanding bonds is about four and one-half per cent. At the close of 1911 there had been built the following public improvements, consisting of paved streets, sidewalks and sewers. Granite Paved Streets 1 1-10 miles Brick Paved Streets 5 8-10 miles Macadam Streets 14 1-10 miles Macadam Streets With Binder 8 5-10 miles Brick Sidewalks 25 miles Granolithic Sidewalks 19 7-10 miles Public Sewers 50 3-10 miles Other extensive public improvements of this character are in process of completion, and additional work is planned in order to keep pace with the requirements of the city's continued growth. All departments of the city government are alert to the needs of the municipality and work in an earnest and efficient manner to achieve the best results possible. Care and attention are displayed, and intelligent service is given to the business pertaining to each branch of the city government, in order that the general scheme of municipal development may be conducted on a broad comprehensive plan, with Roanoke's welfare as the prime consideration.

This continued activity in the construction of new buildings has not been due to speculation in real estate, but is the logical result of the necessity for dwellings and business houses, caused by the growth of the city's manufacturing interests and the steady influx of new population. Post Office Receipts The following table showing the receipts of the United States Post Office in this city from 1903 to 1911, inclusive, is an illustration of the rapid growth of business of every character in this city. The new Post Office building is complete in all its appointments, and the business is handled in an efficient and capable manner.

Cutchin, City of Roanoke 1908 to 1912 Leading Industries VIRGINIA BRIDGE AND IRON COMPANY Probably the largest industrial establishment in Roanoke City, aside from the Norfolk &amp; Western general shops, is the works of the Virginia Bridge and Iron Company, which are located in the eastern section of the city. adjacent to the shos and the Virginia Iron, Coal and Coke Company's furnaces. The Virginia Bridge and Iron Company was organized in 1895, having succeeded the American Bridge Company, which was established a few years previous. At the time of the incorporation of the Virginia Bridge and Iron Company its business comprised principally the manufacture of light highway bridges and structural steel and the company employed in its shops and offices from fifty to seventy-five men. The company since that time has enjoyed most extraordinary growth, from a capital of $50,000 in 1895, the company has grown until it has a BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF ROANOKE PLANT capital of $1,200,000 in 1911. It originally had a small plant at Roanoke, and to-day is operating plants at Roanoke, Memphis, and Atlanta, and its capacity of manufactured product has grown from three thousand tons to one hundred thousand tons. During 1910 the Roanoke plant alone produced forty-five thousand tons of manufactured product and employed on an average of six hundred men. The general offices of the company are also located at the Roanoke plant, where the engineers and draftsmen design and detail its output and where its offices are centralized. These offices are large and modern in their appointment and in which about one hundred executives, engineers, draftsmen, and stenographers are engaged. For more than ten years the company has produced, in addition to its heavy railroad bridges, heavy structural steel for industrial purposes, for skyscrapers and municipal buildings, and a considerable quantity of all steel railroad cars, having manufactured more than three thousand of such cars for several railroads during the year 1910. Its principal product is heavy railroad bridge work, and it is serving all of the principal railroad systems of the south and southwest section of the United States, as well as some of the railroads in Mexico; it also exports structural steel for mill buildings, railroad turntables, and the like to foreign countries; viz., Mexico, Porto Rico, Cuba, etc. Including the forces of the various erection crews in the field erecting its production of structural steel, the company employs about sixteen hundred men. Its shops at Roanoke cover about twelve acres, its Memphis plant about ten acres, and its Atlanta plant approximately five acres. These plants are modern in every particular, and the company manufactures and sells its product in competition with the world. The present directors of the company are as follows: C. Edwin Michael, T. T. Fishburne, J. B. Fishburn, W. B. Bevill, Edw. L. Stone, R. H. Fishburne, W. C. Stephenson, and Jas. P. Woods, of Roanoke, Virginia; E. P. Wharton and Z. V. Taylor, of Greensboro, North Carolina; and S. P. Read, of Memphis, Tennessee. The officers are as follows: C. Edwin Michael, President; T. T. Fishburne, Vice President and Treasurer; J. B. Fishburn, Second Vice President; John R. Parker, Assistant Treasurer and Secretary; A. Z. Drozdov, Third Vice President and Chief Engineer; J. K. Graham, General Manager; G. T. Greer, Purchasing Agent; J. H. Whitner, Contracting Manager; G. A. Tretter, Erection Manager. The capacity of the company's shops is larger than that of all similar shops combined south of Pennsylvania and Ohio. Since the company was started in 1895 it has operated continuously, and has never curtailed its working hours, and the personnel of the management as above shown is sufficient assurance of its conservative constructive policies. A cut of the Roanoke plant is shown herein, which gives some idea of its capacities. The growth of the Virginia Bridge and Iron Company, from a plant in 1895 employing about seventy-five men, to its present proportions and importance History of Roanoke City—Industrial among the industrial enterprises of the country, is an illustration of business development due to excellent management and judgment displayed in the conduct of the company's affairs. The men identified with the management of the company during its successful career have been alert, progressive, and prompt in providing for business situations requiring extensive enlargements and increased capitalization, in order to handle the volume of business offered. This comprehensive and far-seeing policy has enabled the company to provide adequate facilities for every department of its business, and has placed the Virginia Bridge and Iron Company in the front rank among the leading manufacturing plants of the South. The success achieved by the company is a high tribute to the resourcefulness, precision, and business acumen that have characterized its operations. ROANOKE RAILWAY AND ELECTRIC COMPANY One of the important enterprises closely identified with the progress and upbuilding of the city of Roanoke, and which has kept pace with the city's rapid development, assisting in the expansion of its boundaries and knitting together its interests with those of neighboring towns, is the street car system operated by the Roanoke Railway and Electric Company. STEAM POWER PLANT The growing requirements of a population which increased sixty-two per cent. in a decade have been promptly met by this company by a general improvement and enlargement of its system. To-day thirty miles of track, including interurban lines extending nine miles to Salem on the west and two and one-half miles to Vinton on the east, as well as a mile or more in South Roanoke, and a like distance to Norwich and Raleigh Court in the Southwest, and beyond the city limits, indicates the importance of the system. During 1903 the Roanoke Railway and Electric Company began revolutionizing the system. Everything was made new. Old tracks with light rails were torn up and heavier rails laid in all parts of the city. At that time only seven cars were operated on schedule over the entire system. This number has been gradually increased to twenty regular cars, operating on ten, fifteen, and twenty-minute schedules for all lines, both within the city proper and on the interurban lines. Within the past five years several miles of extensions have been built, including that from College Avenue to Lake Spring in Salem; Franklin Road to and including Fifteenth Avenue to Sixth Street, the Highland line, the Belmont line, and the South Roanoke and the Raleigh Court extensions. The equipment now consists of thirty-five passenger cars, one freight car, sprinkler car, snow sweeper, and a service car. All cars are operated from a common center affording quick schedules to every section of the city and to the towns of Salem and Vinton, as well as the suburbs of South Roanoke, Ghent, Virginia Heights, Grandin Place, Raleigh Court, and Norwich. The general office building is located on the corner of Campbell Avenue and Randolph Street, Southeast. It is a handsome three-story structure and is well equipped for the purposes for which it is used. The lower floor has a commodious waiting room for passengers, and the general offices are located here, besides the general electrical display and store room. The second floor is used as headquarters for the lighting and power department, and by the employees when off duty. The part used by the employees is well equipped for purposes of recreation and pleasure of motormen and conductors during leisure hours. Mountain Park with its splendid Casino Building, located two miles south of the business center of the city, is owned by the Company. During the summer season high-class amusements such as comedy, opera, vaudeville, and concerts are given; the park has a dancing pavilion and an orchestra furnishes music afternoons and evenings; it contains modern bowling alleys; a zoological department where many native wild animals are on exhibition; refreshment stands with an up-to-date service; thousands of electric lights artistically arranged together with rustic swings and seats, all making this a most delightful place to spend an afternoon or evening. Since 1903 a sum in excess of three-fourths of a million dollars has been expended in improvements. The Company has rebuilt more than half the entire system, laying much heavier rails and double tracking all of the business center, and much of the residential section traversed by its lines. To-day there are more than five miles of double track. In the meantime the plant of the Roanoke Water Power Company was purchased, thus giving to the enterprise additional current to the extent of four thousand horse power. The new power station was built with a generating capacity of two thousand five hundred kilowatts. This steam station was recently equipped with steam turbines, which has doubled the power capacity from two thousand five hundred kilowatts to five thousand kilowatts. In order to keep fully abreast of the times, and be able to at all times furnish sufficient motive power for the running of cars, as well as being able to supply cheap power for any manufacturing enterprise and keep pace with the steady demand for electricity for lighting purposes, a contract was recently entered into with the Appalachian Power Company for current on the completion of its various plants now being built on New River. With the present steam power plant, the water power plant on Roanoke River and the reserve power from the Appalachian Power Company, it can be accurately stated that no like enterprise in the History of Roanoke City—Industrial country will be better equipped for meeting all demands for electricity for all power and lighting purposes of whatever magnitude, than the Roanoke Railway and Electric Company. With a break down from any one or two of the sources of supply of power, it will be so arranged that within a few moments ample power for all purposes can be transmitted over the wires from the WATER POWER PLANT reserve plants, which will at all times be held in readiness for just such emergencies. The power plant in the city limits was constructed at a total cost of $325,000.00. New car barns of large dimensions have just been completed. This Company employs regularly two hundred and fifteen men, and the well defined policy of its management to use every precaution looking to the safety and comfort of its patrons and to insure a high character of service, in keeping with the demands of its steadily increasing traffic, makes it a most important factor in the city's progress and development. The Roanoke Railway and Electric Company recently inaugurated the pension system for all its employees, the expense of taking care of which is to be borne entirely by the Company. The officers of the Company are as follows: R. D. Apperson, Lynchburg, President; H. J. Crowley, Philadelphia, Vice President; C. L. Tingley, Philadelphia, Secretary and Treasurer; J. W. Hancock, Roanoke, General Manager; W. T. Bush, Superintendent Railway Department; W. G. Claytor, Electrical Engineer; E. H. McConnell, Roadway Engineer; C. C. Hogshead, Chief Engineer, Power Station, and A. D. Vickers, Cashier. Mr. J. W. Hancock, the General Manager, is a native of Franklin County, Virginia. When quite a young man he came to Roanoke and accepted a position in the banking house of S. D. Ferguson which he held for many years. He afterwards went with the Roanoke Railway and Electric Company. Various promotions brought him into the general management of this great public service corporation. Mr. Hancock has been identified with every movement of recent years which has had for its object the betterment of conditions in this city. THE NATIONAL EXCHANGE BANK The National Exchange Bank of Roanoke was incorporated May 7th, 1889, with a capital stock of $100,000. T. T. Fishburne conceived the plan for founding the institution and prominently identified with him in the work of organization were J. B. Fishburn and J. B. Andrews of Roanoke, with J. P. Bell of Lynchburg, and D. Armstrong of Frostburg, Maryland. T. T. Fishburne was the first President of the institution, being succeeded after twelve years' service by J. B. Fishburn, the first cashier, who has occupied the position of president since 1901. J. B. Andrews served as one NATIONAL EXCHANGE BANK BUILDING (Present Quarters) of the vice presidents of the bank, and Messrs. Bell and Armstrong were members of the first board of directors. The bank first had its quarters on West Salem Avenue, near its juncture with Jefferson Street, afterwards removing to the Exchange Building, located on the southeast corner of Salem Avenue and Jefferson Street, and again to the present National Exchange Bank Building, at the intersection of Jefferson Street and Campbell Avenue, one of the most prominent corners in the city. These several changes of location were necessitated by the growing requirements for space, as the business of the bank continued to increase to an extent that the quarters occupied in the first two instances were found entirely inadequate for its needs. On its organization, the National Exchange Bank at once sprang into prominence and favor, as the conduct of its affairs was marked by a carefulness and convervatism that inspired the confidence of the public. The policy of safeguarding the interests of both depositor and stockholder in the placing of loans, proved of incalculable benefit, for when the panic of 1893 occurred, so well had the affairs of the bank been managed, that while deposits fell from over $200,000 to less than $50,000, the bank was able to pay currency for every check presented, and never resorted to the use of scrip at any time during the financial depression. The fact that the National Exchange Bank was able to do this while many financial institutions in larger cities were forced to discontinue payments in currency, added to its prestige as a sound banking institution, for its stability was recognized and its future assured. When the later panic in 1907 took place, the bank suffered no reverses, and continued along the same lines observed during the former widespread financial depression. The business of the bank has increased to the point that its capitalization is now $300,000, with surplus and profits aggregating $500,000, and deposits in excess of $3,000,000. It ranks among the leading financial institutions of History of Roanoke City—Industrial the South and has the distinction of being a "Roll of Honor Bank," the term applied to a bank possessing surplus and profits in excess of its capital. A savings department is a feature of the bank's business, four per cent. being paid on time deposits. The National Exchange Bank recently purchased a tract of land fifty by one hundred feet in dimensions, located immediately opposite its present home, the sum paid being $110,000. The land bought is the most prominent corner in the city, and the bank will at once erect thereon a building for its use costing $150,000. When completed, this structure, which will be built for banking purposes exclusively, will be one of the handsomest and best appointed buildings of the kind in the United States. It will be equipped with the most modern furnishings and supplied with every necessary requisite for the conduct of a banking business. The National Exchange Bank has won its present NEW BUILDING (To be Erected) position of prominence as a banking institution through adherence to a policy based upon sound business principles, and by the uniform courtesy extended by officers and employees to the patrons of the bank. The personnel of the management and office force is of a high character and business is conducted with accuracy and dispatch. The Board of Directors is composed of men prominent in business and financial circles, and is representative of the leading interests of the city. The officers and directors of the National Exchange Bank are as follows: Officers T. T. Fishburne, Chairman of the Board. J. B. Fishburn, President. Lucian H. Cocke, Vice President. Edward L. Stone, Vice President. E. B. Spencer, Cashier. Thomas L. Engleby, Assistant Cashier. Directors J. B. Andrews, James C. Cassell, J. B. Fishburn, R. H. Fishburne, T. W. Goodwin, A. E. King, I. J. Meals, E. B. Spencer, Edward L. Stone, J. R. Weaver, W. K. Andrews, L. H. Cocke, T. T. Fishburne, F. E. Foster, L. E. Johnson, W. H. Lewis, S. B. Pace, W. C. Stephenson, F. B. Thomas, J. L. Vaughan, E. Wile, James P. Woods, and J. B. Newton. WINGATE &amp; McGHEE The firm of Wingate &amp; McGhee has been engaged in general engineering and construction work since 1905, making municipal improvements a specialty. J. H. Wingate, the senior member of the firm, was born in the State of Delaware, but reared in Maryland and cast his lot in the Old Dominion in 1878, where he has since resided. His father, two brothers, and himself have followed the profession of Civil Engineers and business pertaining thereto all their lives. J. H. Wingate has had thirty-five years' experience, covering nearly every branch of the profession and was City Engineer of Roanoke for a period of ten years, resigning to engage in general engineering and contracting work. B. R. McGhee, the junior member of the firm, is likewise a Civil Engineer of vast practical experience. He was born in Bedford County, Virginia, and has practiced his profession for a number of years. He was Assistant City Engineer of Roanoke to Mr. Wingate for several years. This firm has a well equipped plant and their work attests their character as contractors. History of Roanoke City—Industrial VIRGINIA IRON, COAL AND COKE COMPANY Among the notable factors which have contributed to the development of the resources of Southwest Virginia, and to the expansion of the manufacturing interests of that section, the Virginia Iron, Coal and Coke Company has borne a conspicuous part. The mining of coal and iron ore, and the making of coke and pig iron are the most important branches of industry in this portion of the State; and because of the magnitude of its operations and the number of plants owned, this Company has been prominently identified with the development of the whole section. The Virginia Iron, Coal and Coke Company was organized in 1899, at which time it acquired possession of the plants owned by the Carter Coal and Coke Company, which latter company began business in 1897. In December, 1897, George L. Carter organized the MODERN COKE FURNACE AT RADFORD, VIRGINIA Carter Coal and Iron Company, which acquired the Dora Furnace at Pulaski, Virginia, and the various iron ore properties owned by the Dora Furnace in Wythe and Pulaski counties. The Carter Coal and Iron Company also took over the charcoal furnace at Foster Falls, Virginia, and the charcoal furnace at Reed Island, Virginia, along with iron ore properties owned by the companies operating these furnaces. The Company also acquired the coal properties of the Virginia-Tennessee Coal Company, which were located in Southwest Virginia and Eastern Kentucky, and include the famous Tom's Creek operation, which is the largest single operation in Southwest Virginia. In January, 1899, when the Virginia Iron, Coal and Coke Company was organized, it acquired all of the properties mentioned in the foregoing, and, in addition thereto, acquired by purchase the following iron furnace properties: Crozer Furnace at Roanoke, Virginia; Radford Furnace at Radford, Virginia; Max Meadows Furnace at Max Meadows, Virginia; Bristol Furnace at Bristol, Virginia; Graham Furnace at Graham, Virginia; Middlesboro Furnace at Middlesboro, Kentucky; Cranberry Furnace at Johnson City, Tennessee, Embreeville Furnace at Embreeville, Tennessee, and the Buena Vista Furnace at Buena Vista, Virginia.

Recent Increase in Coal Shipments The Company increased its coal shipments during the last fiscal year by over 350,000 tons in excess of shipments for the previous fiscal year; and during the first six months of the present fiscal year made a further increase of 140,000 tons over shipments made during the corresponding period of the last fiscal year. The Company has recently secured a contract calling for the delivery of 66,000 tons of coal per month for a period of five years, which will mean steady employment for the miners at work at the Tom's Creek operation for the period mentioned. A large portion of the coal mined by the Company is shipped to New England points, as well as to railroads, and to cotton mills and other industrial enterprises throughout the South. The furnaces owned by the Company, with all the nine stacks in operation, produce about fifteen hundred tons of pig iron per day, besides a small quantity of high-grade charcoal iron made at Foster Falls, Virginia. The Company has no sale agency for the sale of its pig iron, and is now handling its tonnage on the open market. The coal product is handled by the General Offices of the Company through its sales department. The Company at one time operated the Virginia Southwestern Railway, known as "The Natural Tunnel Route," comprising one hundred and sixty miles of railroad extending from Mountain City, Tennessee, to a connection with the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad at Appalachia, Virginia. This road was sold to the Southern Railway system after an extension had been built into the Black Mountain coal territory of Lee County, and also a cut-off built, known as the Holston River Railway, from Moccasin Gap on the Virginia Southwestern Line to Persia, Tennessee, on the Southern Railway. When the Company sold the Virginia &amp; Southwestern Railway, the general offices were removed from Bristol, Tennessee, to Roanoke, about three years ago. The present quarters of the Company consist of two entire floors in the Strickland Building. The office force consists of about twenty-five clerks, and thousands of men are employed at the various plants, mines, and other operations owned by the Company. The capital stock of the Company is $10,000,000. The bonded indebtedness was originally $10,000,000, but this has been reduced within the last few years to $5,289,000. The officers of the Company are: John B. Newton, President; Henry K. McHarg, Jr., Vice President and General Manager; D. D. Hull, Jr., General Counsel; John W. Cure, Secretary and Treasurer; William N. Morgan, Purchasing Agent; W. B. Bowles, Auditor; C. W. Owen, General Sales Agent, Roanoke, Virginia; and Charles B. Colebrook, Assistant Secretary, 40 Wall Street, New York. The Company a Factor in Industrial Development From the standpoint of industrial development, the importance to a section of country of business operations conducted on the scale of those of the Virginia Iron, Coal and Coke Company cannot be overestimated. Thousands of men are afforded employment, whole communities receive tangible benefits, and general business conditions are vastly improved in consequence of the operation of such enterprises. The business policy of the Company has been broad and comprehensive, and its development work has been conducted judiciously, and along lines which will enable it to keep pace with the growing demands of its trade. Its product ranks among the best on the market, and has an established reputation for quality and uniformity of grade. The officers of the Company are men well qualified to manage the important interests intrusted to their care, and have displayed marked ability in handling its extensive business transactions. Roanoke is fortunate in being the headquarters of an institution which is taking so active and important a part in the industrial development that is causing a transformation of conditions throughout this whole section of the South. History of Roanoke City—Industrial THE STONE PRINTING AND MANUFACTURING COMPANY Prominent among the manufacturing enterprises of Virginia and of this city is the printing establishment of The Stone Printing and Manufacturing Company, which has the distinction of being the largest and most modern exclusive printing establishment in the South. This Company originally began business in Roanoke in 1883, on Commerce Street, occupying a floor space of less than five hundred square feet. Later it moved to the second story of the Gale Building, on the corner of Jefferson Street and Railroad Avenue, pending the completion of its special building on North Jefferson Street. In subsequent years, this last named building was doubled, and then doubled again, in size, until it eventually became apparent that very much enlarged quarters must be provided to take care of the constantly growing volume of business. The present home of the Company, Nos. 116-132 North Jefferson Street, completed in the latter part of 1907, has a frontage of two hundred and eighteen feet, with a depth of one hundred and ten feet; giving a total floor space in the two stories of approximately fifty thousand square feet. In the entire mechanical department there is no overhead shafting or belting; all machines being run by individual motors. Besides the officers of the Company, there are employed in the business offices twenty-one persons— estimators, stenographers, bookkeepers, clerks, etc. In all departments the plant employs about two hundred people. The composing room, which occupies over twelve thousand square feet of floor space, is situated on the first floor, and employs over fifty people. Besides all the modern appliances and material for rapid and up-to-date printing, this department has seven type-setting machines, using both the Linotype and the Monotype. The cylinder press room occupies six thousand three hundred and forty-four square feet of floor space, and is equipped with sixteen presses. The job press room occupies one thousand six hundred and eighty-eight square feet of floor space and employs eighteen persons. It is equipped with thirteen presses. The bindery, situated on the second floor, occupies nine thousand seven hundred and forty square feet of floor space, and is well equipped for every class of binding. A feature of the plant is the engraving and designing department, where an artist is kept constantly employed making special designs or submitting sketches for prospective work. The Company's business extends over the entire South, and it also sends its products to New York and other northern points, as well as to the Pacific Coast. The printing of school, college, and university annuals is an important department of the business (dating from 1894, when the first annual was printed), and it is probable that The Stone Printing and Manufacturing Company has printed more annuals than any other printing establishment in the country. Several years ago the Company installed a scientific cost accounting system, which enables it to calculate exactly the cost of each job of printing as it goes out of the shipping department. The Company has, since its organization, conducted what is known as an "open shop," never having had at any time any agreement or having signed any scale with any labor organization. The general policy of the Company has been to pay according to merit, loyalty, enthusiasm, special ability, or service rendered; without regard as to whether an employee is a member of a labor union or any other organization or not; and its most valued employees have always received better wages than the scales demand. Present capitalization of the Company is $350,000. Its officers are, Edward L. Stone, President; T. T. Fishburne, Vice President; Albert A. Stone, Secretary; G. G. Gooch, Jr., Treasurer; and Fleming R. Hurt, Manager. History of Roanoke City—Industrial HOTEL ROANOKE Among the various factors which contribute to the advertisement of a city, and the favor with which it is regarded by the public generally, the advantages possessed in the character of its hotel facilities is of high importance. In this respect, the city of Roanoke can claim the distinction of having, in the Hotel Roanoke, an institution BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF HOTEL ROANOKE which ranks among the best in the land, and which has been identified with the progress of the city throughout its entire history. This famous resort was opened in October, 1882, and the building at that time consisted of from forty-five to fifty rooms, comprising what is now known as the east wing of the hotel. In 1890 it was enlarged to its present size and now contains ninety-four rooms. On July 1st, 1898, a large portion of the new structure was destroyed by fire, and the same was rebuilt, and reopened in March, 1899. The building is situated on an eminence from which can be viewed the city, as well as a large part of the Roanoke Valley for miles around, being the center of a panoramic display of unusual beauty. The general appearance of the property suggests the private domain of some large landed proprietor, rather than a hotel. The knoll upon which it stands is laid out as a park of ten acres, with broad, well-kept walks and driveways, with fountains always playing and myriads of flowers in bloom, with graceful hemlock hedges and rows of dwarf shrubs; with numerous trees, whose verdure shades from the dense green of the magnolia to the lustrous, shining whiteness of the silver maple, as the constant breeze plays with the foliage. The building itself is a fine specimen of Queen Anne architecture, with broad piazzas and splendid halls. Everything within suggests roomy comfort and delights the artistic eye. A sun parlor, glass walled, faces the city and is decorated with potted plants, and furnished with all the requisites of a perfect lounging place. It contains a smoking room for men and a reception room for ladies. The parlor, which is beautifully decorated and exquisitely furnished, has been of great service for social affairs, receptions and other functions; its rare beauty and convenience being one of the striking features of the hotel. The hotel throughout is equipped with every requisite for the comfort and convenience of guests. The sleeping apartments are large and are furnished tastefully, and are comfortable in all respects. There are a number of bath rooms, which are modern and sanitary in every particular. The kitchen arrangements are unsurpassed by those of any hotel in the South, and the facilities are adequate to take care of four hundred guests; as this department of the hotel was recently enlarged and modernized in all essentials, looking to the ultimate building of a large addition to the present structure. The hotel is renowned for its excellent table, as discriminating care is exercised in the purchase of the best supplies obtainable, while a first-class chef attends to the preparation. The business is conducted by Fred E. Foster, the proprietor of Hotel Roanoke, who has been identified with handling high-grade resorts for health and pleasure seekers for many years. His first connection with the hotel business in Virginia was in 1887, when he had charge of the hotels and eating rooms at the stations on the line of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad, among which were the Hotel Roanoke, Bluefield Inn, at Bluefield, West Virginia, Maple Shade Inn, at Pulaski, Virginia, and the Radford Inn, at Radford, Virginia. After remaining in the employ of the company for about five years, he resigned, and the company afterwards handled the hotels itself. ENTRANCE FROM NORFOLK &amp; WESTERN STATION On March 10th, 1902, Mr. Foster returned to Roanoke and leased the Hotel Roanoke, which he has conducted since that date. He has devoted unceasing care and attention to perfecting every detail of the business, in order to make the hotel an ideal summer resort and stopping place, and has attained eminent success in his endeavors. Under his management the name of the Hotel Roanoke has been a synonym for comfort and hospitality, and its popularity is attested by the continuous patronage it receives from an appreciative and discriminating public. History of Roanoke City—Industrial CENTRAL MANUFACTURING COMPANY Wholesale and Retail Dealers in Lime, Lumber, Cement, and Plaster. One of the Leading Establishments of Its Kind in Southwest Virginia BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF CENTRAL MANUFACTURING COMPANY The Central Manufacturing Company was established in 1892 on a small scale and by fair, honest dealings and upright business methods it has increased in size until its present large proportions have been reached. This pioneer establishment employs seventy-five men and good wages are paid to all of its employees. They are manufacturers and wholesale and retail dealers in Lime, Lumber, Cement, Plaster, Sewer Pipe, Fire Brick and Clay, rough and dressed Lumber, Flooring, Ceiling, Sash, Doors and Blinds, and all kinds of building material and shop work. This establishment has an extensive line of high-grade shop work and everything in the building line is manufactured. The plant is located in the very heart of the city and occupies two blocks of ground, with CRYSTAL SPRING RESERVOIR AND PARK superior shipping and delivery facilities. The policy of the plant has been one of square dealing and their success is largely attributed to this, coupled with the superior class of work turned out. There is no contract too large or too small to be undertaken by the Central Manufacturing Company. Robert H. Angell, the proprietor, is surrounded by thorough and practical men, who know their business when it comes to figuring out the price of building material, etc. The officers of the company are as follows: R. H. Angell, President; Walter Crawford, Vice President; S. P. Britts, Secretary. The trade of this concern is by no means of a local nature for goods are shipped throughout Southwest Virginia, West Virginia, and along all lines of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway. They are the manufacturers of the Standard Tariff Cabinet for large printing houses and these cabinets are sold all over the country and in the Dominion of Canada. Mr. Angell owns a similar plant in Lynchburg which is in command of a satisfactorily increasing business throughout that city and section. ROANOKE GAS AND WATER COMPANY Roanoke, Virginia Offices, Anchor Building, No. 301 Henry Street; Gas Plant, Kimball Avenue, Northeast; Water Works, South Roanoke. Officers: E. M. Funkhouser, President; S. D. Ferguson, Vice President; J. E. Duerson, Treasurer. Directors: W. K. Andrews, W. S. Battle, Jr., D. J. Breslin, O. L. Bottomley, A. J. Kennard, D. E. Spangler, J. R. Terry. The Roanoke Gas and Water Company was organized July 1st, 1889, acquiring the property of the Roanoke Gas Company and the Roanoke Water Works. The first President of the Company was Mr. Frederick History of Roanoke City—Industrial J. Kimball, who acted in this capacity until he resigned in 1902, at which time Mr. Henry S. Trout was elected President. Mr. Trout was President of the Company from 1902 until he resigned December 31st, 1906, at which time the present President, Mr. Edgar M. Funkhouser, was elected. Beginning in 1889, when the population of Roanoke was about sixteen thousand, the equipment and service of both the Gas and Water Departments have always kept ahead of the rapid growth of Roanoke until now, with a population of about thirty-eight thousand, the city has the present efficient Gas and Water Plants. The property acquired in 1889 by the present Company embraced the Gas Works, consisting of real estate, fifteen retorts for making gas, one gas holder of fifty thousand cubic feet capacity, and about eight miles of gas mains. The water property acquired in 1889, embraced real estate, on which was located the Crystal Spring with a flow of about five million gallons per twenty-four hours, a distributing reservoir of two million gallons capacity, pumping station consisted of one pumping engine of two million gallons capacity and about fifteen miles of water mains. The Company has improved and enlarged its equipment BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF PLANT until at present the gas works embrace, besides real estate, forty-two retorts for making gas, three gas holders with a total storage capacity of three hundred and seventy-five thousand cubic feet, a complete modern Lowe Water Gas Set and about thirty-five miles of gas mains. The old mains have also been relaid with larger sizes. The Company manufactures gas for both illuminating and fuel purposes, using both the coal and water process. The annual consumption is about seventy million cubic feet. The present improved water property embraces, besides real estate, Crystal Spring with a flow of about five million gallons and the Muse Springs with a flow of about two million gallons per twenty-four hours, a distributing reservoir of two million gallons and an impounding reservoir of three million gallons storage capacity. The pumping station now consists of three pumping engines with a combined pumping capacity of nine million gallons, and there are seventy-two miles of water mains. These mains are all of sufficient size, the old mains having been relaid with larger sizes. The Company supplies about ninety-five per cent. of the inhabitants of Roanoke with remarkably pure spring water. There are very few cities in the United States, the size of Roanoke, having an unlimited supply of such good, pure, wholesome spring water for the use of its citizens. Roanoke's present source of supply is derived from the Crystal and one of the Muse Springs. The water from these two springs is exceedingly clear and has the usual sparkle of limestone water. It is of excellent quality and is entirely satisfactory for drinking and all other household purposes. The city's daily average consumption, as shown by the number of gallons pumped, is about four million gallons per twenty-four hours. ADAMS, PAYNE &amp; GLEAVES A Leading Industrial Establishment of Roanoke, which has been a Most Important Factor in the Progress of the City Among the various enterprises of Roanoke which stand out prominently in the industrial development of the city, there is none which takes higher rank than the firm whose name captions this article. For a long term of years, the men who are identified with this concern have been connected with the upbuild-ing of Lynchburg and in 1906 began the operation of their various plants in Roanoke, adopting as a slogan "Everything for building, but hardware." This firm is engaged in the manufacture of brick of the best commercial varieties, the capacity of their present plant being forty thousand daily. They have now under construction a new brick plant which will turn out an additional eighty thousand bricks per day. The present planing mill of this progressive firm located on Walnut Avenue, Southeast, was found to be entirely inadequate for their increasing business and they are now building a modern, fireproof planing mill on South Jefferson Street, which will be the equal of the most modern in the country, and the installation of the new up-to-date machinery will largely increase the facilities of this already large and important industrial establishment. The Lumber Yards carry, ordinarily, from two to three million feet of lumber, and in the warehouse every form of plaster and cement used in building operations is carried in stock. This warehouse has a floor area of forty thousand square feet or nearly one acre. All stock sizes of sash, doors, columns, and blinds are carried, as well as metal laths and reönforcing material for concrete construction. The Sewer Pipe Yard carries every size of sewer pipe from three up to twenty-four inches, including agricultural drain tile, fire brick and flue History of Roanoke City—Industrial BRICK YARD AND KILNS linings by the best manufacturers of the country, and in all of the standard sizes. The Coal Yard of Adams, Payne &amp; Gleaves has a capacity of three thousand tons and all grades of both hard and soft coal are constantly carried in stock. To this has been added a feed department, carrying all of the most approved feed for horses and cows, including beet pulp and union grain, much of which is sold to the dairying interests surrounding Roanoke. The officers of this progressive concern are C. S. Adams, President; Taylor Gleaves, Vice President; F. W. Kling, Treasurer; and H. H. Harris, Secretary. THE FIRST NATIONAL BANK The First National Bank of Roanoke, Virginia, was organized in 1882, with a capital stock of $50,000, and was first located in the Watts, Bell &amp; Evans' Building on Commerce Street, which at that time was the leading business street of Big Lick. In the course of a few months' time the capital stock of the bank was increased to $100,000, and it remained at those figures until 1907, when it was increased to $300,000, and later in May, 1910, to the sum of $400,000 which is its present capital stock. The quarters were eventually moved from Commerce Street to the Southwest corner of Salem Avenue and Henry Street, and in 1892 the business of the bank had assumed proportions which made necessary more commodious quarters, which were secured in the Terry Building. The business was conducted at that location until December 27th, 1910, when the bank removed to its present ideal quarters in the splendid new First National Bank Building, on the Southwest corner of Jefferson Street and Salem Avenue. The bank's new home is a handsome structure, eight stories in height, fireproof throughout, fifty by one hundred feet in dimensions, and contains ninety-six office rooms in addition to the banking quarters, which occupy the entire first floor. This building is modern in all its appointments and THE NEW BANK BUILDING the bank's offices are fitted up with the most modern and up-to-date banking furniture and equipment obtainable. The building cost $260,000, and the sum of $60,000 was paid for the ground on which it stands. History of Roanoke City—Industrial It is one of the handsomest and most substantially built structures of the kind in the country, and is a notable addition to the buildings of the city. During its long and successful career the First National Bank has pursued a policy of conservatism and care in guarding the interests of its patrons, and has continued to grow in popularity. Its business has shown a steady and substantial growth, and it ranks to-day among the leading financial institutions of the South; with a capital of $400,000, surplus and undivided profits in excess of $500,000, deposits aggregating $3,000,000, and total resources of more than $4,000,000. During the panic of 1893 and throughout the later financial depression of 1907, the bank paid currency for every check presented, and at no time resorted to the use of scrip. This attested its stability at a time when many similar institutions in other cities were forced to the expedient of using scrip to meet the demands of depositors. Hon. Henry S. Trout was the first President of the bank and has served in that position since the date of its organization. J. W. Shields was the first Cashier and acted in that capacity until the time of his death which occurred in 1903, when he was succeeded by the present Cashier, J. Tyler Meadows, who has held every position in the bank, from that of runner to his present office as Vice President and Cashier. The First National Bank is the oldest financial instistution in the city, and its progress has kept pace with the growth of Roanoke. Its operations have been characterized by a strict observance of sound banking principles, and courtesy and care are manifested in all transactions with its patrons. The personnel of the management and office force is of a high order, and efficiency is evidenced in every branch of the business. A savings department is a feature of the bank's business, three per cent. being paid on time deposits. The Board of Directors of the First National Bank is composed of men prominent in the affairs of the city. The officers and directors of the institution are as follows: Officers: Henry S. Trout, President; David W. Flickwir, Vice President; J. Tyler Meadows, Vice President and Cashier; J. C. Davenport, Assistant Cashier. Directors: H. S. Trout, David W. Flickwir, T. C. Denton, A. M. Nelson, L. H. Vaughan, James M. Gambill, A. L. Sibert, Dr. J. D. Kirk, Frank W. Read, S. H. Heironimus, N. D. Maher, and J. Tyler Meadows. ROANOKE BRIDGE COMPANY INCORPORATED The Roanoke Bridge Company, Incorporated, was organized February 14th, 1906, with E. C. McComb, President; J. B. Botts, Vice President and Treasurer; S. H. Heironimus, Assistant Treasurer, and S. H. Holland, Secretary. These gentlemen with H. B. McComb, constitute the Board of Directors of this progressive enterprise. The Roanoke Bridge Company was organized with the purpose in view of constructing county and municipal bridge work and formerly had contract with the Virginia Bridge and Iron Company to fabricate all structural steel in their shops at a specified price, while the Roanoke Bridge Company contracted for and erected in the field. This plan of procedure obtained until the beginning of 1911 when shops were built at the intersection of the Virginian and Norfolk &amp; Western Railways, in the southeastern part of the city, when the contract with the Virginia Bridge and Iron Company was severed. The year of 1911 has been the most successful of any in the history of this enterprise. When organized the capital stock was $35,000 all of which is owned by a few well known and progressive citizens of this city. The authorized stock at the present time is $140,000. The Roanoke Bridge Company operates in all of the Southern States and conducts branch offices in Atlanta, Georgia; Rock Hill, South Carolina, and Jacksonville, Florida. At the present time, a force of about three hundred and fifty men are employed, including office forces here and elsewhere, shop forces at the Roanoke plant, and men connected with the construction work throughout the country. About twenty gangs are now engaged in various parts of the country in structural and bridge work. PARTIAL INTERIOR VIEW Among the recent contracts secured by this firm is a seven hundred foot bridge, including a two hundred foot draw span, over the Nanticoke River in Maryland, at a cost of $55,000; a $26,000 bridge in Polk County, Tennessee; the building of the Wasena Bridge over the Roanoke River, for the Wasena Land Company and contracts were recently closed for the construction of thirty-three bridges in Wise and Lee counties in Virginia. A contract for an oil house, one hundred by two hundred feet near New Orleans was recently completed; also large warehouse and car shops for the Carolina &amp; Northwestern Railway at Hickory, North Carolina. The Roanoke Bridge Company is also general contractor for reönforced concrete work and substructures of all kinds. At the new plant in Roanoke, a large and substantial brick office building has been constructed, with every modern convenience. From eighty to one hundred men are employed regularly in the shops in this city and the clerical forces number about twenty people. This company, since its organization, nearly six years ago, has contracted for and erected about six hundred bridges throughout the Southern States. History of Roanoke City—Industrial THE ROANOKE TIMES AND THE EVENING NEWS The Roanoke Daily Times was established by M. H. Claytor in 1886, the first issue appearing on November 29th, of that year. This was the first daily paper ever published in the city. It began as a morning paper and has been continuously published as such since. After a few years Mr. Claytor sold out to J. T. Hall, C. T. Grandy, and others. The paper was published then on Jefferson Street between Salem and Campbell avenues. In 1890 the ownership again changed, the Lazell Brothers being the principal owners. The paper was then published in the building on the northwest corner of Campbell Avenue and Henry Street, with Herbert J. Browne as Editor. A year or so later the Roanoke Publishing Company was chartered and M. H. Claytor, the first owner and publisher resumed the management, and the plant was moved to its present quarters on Campbell Avenue, Southwest. This was in 1894. Several years later it became necessary to have additional room, and a new building was erected beside the one then occupied by the Roanoke Publishing Company, it being constructed with the view of using it for a modern newspaper office. Linotype machines were purchased, and in order to keep pace with the growing demand for a morning daily not only in the city, but in all of Southwest Virginia, a modern Hoe perfecting press was installed with a capacity of ten thousand sixteen page papers per hour. In the year 1902 the Roanoke Publishing Company purchased the Evening News, an afternoon paper which had been established a year before. This publication was popular as a penny paper, but later when it was increased to eight pages the price was raised to two cents per copy, at which price it has since been published. It at once sprang into prominence locally and attained a wide home circulation. In the latter part of 1909 the Roanoke Publishing Company sold The Roanoke Times and The Evening News to The Roanoke Times Company, Incorporated, composed of Alfred B. Williams, H. G. Buchanan, W. S. Battle, J. B. Fishburn, W. E. Thomas, and Edward L. Stone. The new owners assumed control on December 15th, 1909, with W. E. Thomas as Business Manager. On January 1st, 1910, Alfred B. Williams, formerly editor of the Richmond News-Leader, became the Editor of the two publications. Both papers are Democratic in principle, and are important factors in the upbuilding of Roanoke and Southwest Virginia where the Roanoke Times has a wide circulation. The Roanoke Times is now preparing to build a modern fireproof newspaper building for housing its plant on the northwest corner of Campbell Avenue and Commerce Street, facing the City Hall and the Ponce de Leon Hotel. ROANOKE OVERALLS COMPANY INCORPORATED A New and Important Enterprise Which is Destined to Result in Great Good to This City and Section. The Roanoke Overalls Company, Incorporated, which was established in March, 1911, is a joint stock company in which a number of Roanoke's influential business men are interested. It started with a capital of $10,000 but it was soon apparent that the capital stock was inadequate to carry on the business as planned and it was immediately increased to $25,000. The company now occupies a handsome two-story brick structure on First Avenue, Northwest, extending through to Center Street, the building being sixty-five by two hundred feet. It is owned by Mr. H. C. Elliott and was constructed especially for the home of this new enterprise. The Roanoke Overalls Company, Incorporated, manufactures overalls, shirts, and working pants and is equipped with all the latest machinery and modern appliances for the manufacture of this line of goods, the present capacity of the plant being six hundred pairs of overalls and working pants per day. It is the intention of the promoters of the enterprise to greatly increase the output in the near future. New machinery is being installed for this purpose, when from one hundred and twenty-five VIEW OF THE PLANT to one hundred and fifty people will be given employment, all of whom will command good wages, for the character of work turned out from this plant. The company has already established a fine business and the demand for its output is growing rapidly. Shipments have been made to the states of Nebraska, Texas, Florida, Georgia, North and South Carolina, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York, Kentucky, and Tennessee. Besides, the products of this factory have been shipped to a number of Central American States and to Panama. So successful has been the operation of the plant and the demand for its products so great, it has become necessary to open an office in New York. Through this office a large portion of the products of the Roanoke Overalls Company will be handled for foreign trade. The "$" mark is the trade mark of this new enterprise and it is placed on all goods manufactured, being emblematical of the fact that the purchaser receives full value for every dollar invested. The officers of the company are J. C. Cassell, President; H. C. Elliott, Vice President; W. R. Reamy, Secretary and Treasurer, and E. G. Saunders, Manager. These officers, with Mr. J. M. Darden, of Suffolk, Virginia, constitute the Board of Directors. The officers of the company are all well-known business men and most of them are identified with large commercial interests in this city and section. They are progressive and all take an active part in everything pertaining to the welfare and progress of the city of Roanoke. Mr. W. R. Reamy, Secretary and Treasurer of the Roanoke Overalls Company has been a citizen of Roanoke for History of Roanoke City—Industrial many years and is well and favorably known to the general public. Mr. E. G. Saunders, the General Manager is a native of Knoxville, Tennessee, and came to Roanoke from Cincinnati, Ohio. He brought with him an experience of twenty years in this particular line of business and is thoroughly acquainted with all of its details. He is a wide-awake young business man and under his superb management the business of this splendid industrial enterprise seems assured of the success which it so richly deserves. THE HOTEL PONCE DE LEON The Hotel Ponce de Leon is situated on the ground originally occupied by a stone building constructed in 1797, by William Stover. This building was the first erected in this immediate vicinity, and was the nucleus of what later became known as Big Lick, the precursor of the city of Roanoke. While the settlements in the vicinity of the old town of Gainsborough were later called Big Lick, they were locally known as the "Old Lick" after the building of the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railway Station in 1852, and the erection of houses in the vicinity of the Stover home. THE PONCE DE LEON Consequently this house was the oldest in the new "Big Lick," the name of which was changed to that of "Roanoke" in 1882. The place was purchased by John Trout in about 1838, and was a well-known stopping place for travelers in antebellum days as well as in later times, and was known as the "Trout House." In 1884 the hotel was leased by Charles G. Smith, the present owner, who changed its name to that of the "Commercial Hotel," and this with a frame structure that stood on the premises, was one of the prominent hotels of the city in the early days of Roanoke. Mr. Smith later became the owner of the property, and having confidence in the future of Roanoke, decided to erect a large modern hotel building, and in the summer of 1888, the work of construction was commenced. The hotel on completion contained one hundred and twenty rooms and was six stories in height. It was completed in the fall of 1890, and the first dinner was served on Thanksgiving Day, November 28th, of that year. From time to time improvements of various kinds were made, and in 1906 it became apparent that the growing patronage of the house demanded greatly increased accommodations. Accordingly, an addition, also six stories in height, was built fronting on Campbell Avenue, and the hotel now contains one hundred and eighty-five rooms, with power house and other necessary accessories. This new addition is finished throughout with rare taste and the furnishings and equipment of every character will compare favorably with the largest hotels in the country. At the time this work was undertaken the old portion of the building was also completely overhauled in order that everything throughout the house would be in keeping with the splendid new addition. The growing requirements of the business now necessitate still further space, and plans have been decided upon whereby another addition eight stories in height, and containing one hundred and forty rooms will be built. When this is completed the entire structure will contain three hundred and twenty-five rooms, with powerhouse, Rathskeller, cold storage facilities, and every modern appliance and convenience found in the leading metropolitan hotels. The new plans contemplate many important changes in the old structure, which will be remodeled in order to conform in every respect with the latest addition, which will be fireproof and furnished throughout with brass bedsteads and mahogany furniture. The new rotunda will be fifty-two feet in width and over one hundred feet in depth, and will be finished in its entirety with white marble. The reception parlors will be one hundred and fifty-two feet in depth and adjoining them will be a Tea Room for social entertainments, a Ladies' Writing Room, and one for men, with a Ball Room of ample size. A prominent feature of the new addition will be a Roof Garden, and when the two additional stories are placed on the present structure there will be added an immense Sun Parlor. Few hotels throughout the South are so well equipped as the Hotel Ponce de Leon, and its continued and growing patronage bespeaks the popularity it enjoys with the traveling public. It is conducted on both the American and the European plans, and is noted for the cleanliness which exists in every department, and for the attention and care given to the comfort and convenience of guests. The growth of the Hotel Ponce de Leon, from a small stone building, containing about a dozen rooms to the present splendid structure, complete in all hotel essentials, is typical of the development of the city of Roanoke, and it is furthermore a high tribute to the pluck and energy of the owner and proprietor, who persisted under difficulties which at times confronted him, in building a hotel which is a credit to the city and a monument to his untiring perseverance. It is a favorite resort for the traveling public and one of the best known hotels in the South. THE VIRGINIA AND TENNESSEE TELEPHONE COMPANY The Virginia and Tennessee Telephone Company started business in Roanoke in 1898 by purchasing the plant of the Interstate Telephone Company. In 1906 the Virginia and Tennessee Telephone Company merged with the Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company, and the two old obsolete plants were History of Roanoke City—Industrial at once converted into the present modern "Central Energy" system, the identity of the Virginia and Tennessee Telephone Company being preserved by the new company retaining the name and its officers and stockholders remaining with the new organization. The officers elected at the time of the merger were D. D. Hull, Jr., President; George M. Holstein, Vice ADMINISTRATIVE AND EXCHANGE BUILDING President, and B. Laughon, General Manager. Shortly afterwards Mr. Hull resigned as President and W. T. Gentry of Atlanta, Georgia, was elected to succeed him, and he served in that capacity until 1908, when N. C. Watts of Staunton, Virginia, was placed at the head of this great public service corporation. In 1909 officers were again elected as follows: N. C. Watts, President; B. Laughon, Vice President; Addison Maupin, Secretary and Treasurer; N. O. Wood, General Manager, all of whom are now serving in their respective capacities. In 1906 when the new organization was effected, the old obsolete aerial magneto plants of the two old companies gave way to the establishment of the more modern underground "Central Energy" system mentioned above. Unsightly poles with cross arms strung with wires were torn down and in the entire business area of the city, and to a considerable distance in the residence area, all wires leading to the central station were put in underground conduits, and almost in all residence sections the aerial wire construction has been replaced with cable construction, thus preventing continuous trouble by the crossing of wires so prevalent under the old system. The Virginia and Tennessee Telephone Company now operates three thousand two hundred local stations with an additional four hundred in Salem. To this may be added an additional four hundred country stations making four thousand in all, with which direct connection is given without additional cost to subscribers. The country lines included are the Vinton, Roanoke, and Bedford Telephone Company, The Fruit Growers' Telephone Exchange at Poages Mill, and the Mutual Telephone Company of Roanoke and Franklin counties. Arrangements have also been gradually effected whereby connection is secured with telephone lines in almost every county in Southwest Virginia at reasonable toll rates which have been approved in every instance by the State Corporation Commission. Long distance connections are made with the Southern Bell Telephone and Telegraph Company, and with other large kindred concerns so that Roanoke is in close telephonic communication with all the large cities of the United States as well as with all places where the telephone has been established. From an industrial view point fifty-five people at good wages are carried regularly on the pay roll, and at times from five to ten additional persons are employed. The operating force at the central station numbers thirty experienced young ladies, and the service in Roanoke has reached a high standard of efficiency. Under the superb management of Mr. N. O. Wood, a campaign of education in the use of the telephone has been successfully launched, and much trouble and loss of time has been averted. For instance the users of the telephone have been taught to call all numbers by the use of the various figures composing the number wanted. In calling 'phone seven hundred and eleven, instead of saying to the central office, "Give me seven hundred and eleven," or "seven eleven," say "seven, one, one." This prevents the confusion of numbers sounding alike, and saves much time and worry to both the user of the telephone and to the young lady in the central office. NEWTON OLIVER WOOD Newton Oliver Wood, General Manager of the Virginia and Tennessee Telephone Company was born in North Carolina, October 11th, 1868. In his boyhood days he attended the public schools of his native state and Oak Ridge Institute, near Greensboro. In 1890 he came to Roanoke, but left within a few days for Richmond, Virginia, where he became connected with the Southern Bell Telephone Company, remaining with that institution until 1906 when he went to Asheville, North Carolina with the Asheville Telephone and Telegraph Company, where he had charge of the construction work on a new plant. Later he went to Charlotte, North Carolina as Division Plant Superintendent of the Southern Bell Telephone Company, which position he resigned History of Roanoke City—Industrial in April, 1909, to take charge of the business of the Virginia and Tennessee Telephone Company in Roanoke and Southwest Virginia. During his three years in this city great improvements have been wrought in the Roanoke telephone system. The local exchange has increased from one thousand and nine hundred to three thousand and two hundred stations with about four hundred country subscribers being added within the same time. In addition to this, under his administration, the lines have been extended from Chilhowie into Bristol City, Wise and Lee counties and as far as Clintwood in Dickinson County, Virginia. Many aerial cables have been strung from one end of the city to the other since Mr. Wood took charge of this great public service corporation. On October 16th, 1895 he married Nora Newbern, daughter of G. B. and Resia Newbern of Currituck County, North Carolina. Two sons have been born to this union; namely, George W., aged fifteen years, and Newton Oliver, Jr., aged three years. RESERVOIR OF VINTON-ROANOKE WATER COMPANY 120,000,000 Gallons Capacity THE VINTON-ROANOKE WATER COMPANY Supplies a Large Percentage of the Water Used in This City, Owned and Operated by Wide-Awake Progressive Business People In May, 1909, C. Markley and Judge J. W. Woods, purchased the controlling interest in the Vinton-Roanoke Water Company, since which time C. Markley has been the Manager of same. Under his management, great improvements have been made by parking and planting in bluegrass all of the lands of the water shed, which had been formerly farmed. The water shed consists of a vase-like shape of land on the top of the Blue Ridge Mountains and covers an area of about thirteen hundred acres, which is well taken care of and patrolled to prevent trespassing and is, therefore, in a thoroughly sanitary condition. The water is pure freestone and is used by hundreds of families and by the manufacturers throughout this city. It supplies the Norfolk &amp; Western shops, round house, the furnace, brewery, and many other of our large manufacturing enterprises. The Company is now tunnelling through the spur of the Blue Ridge Mountains two thousand feet, through almost solid granite and when completed it will divert an additional water supply of two and one-half million gallons from springs. The present reservoir is seven hundred and fifty feet above the city of Roanoke, giving the Company in high pressure mains to Vinton three hundred feet to the square inch, which is reduced by pressure valve, regulated as to the flow of the water. The analysis of the Vinton-Roanoke water shows that it is good. The water is brought to the city through ten inch mains and extends over the business portion of the city, also throughout the Southeast and Northwest sections. There is a growing demand for this water on account of its softness. The officers of the Company are as follows: C. Markley, President; Judge J. W. Woods, Vice President; Claude Moore, Secretary-Treasurer; S. C. Markley, Sanitary Engineer. Young Mr. Markley took a special course at Yale University for this particular line of work, graduating in July, 1911, Hugh M. McGee is Superintendent of Construction and he keeps the plant in splendid condition. THE CITY NATIONAL BANK The substantial growth of the City National Bank is indicative of the progress made in all lines of business in Roanoke within the past decade. This financial institution, which was chartered May 10th, 1906, has met with a measure of success that confirmed the judgment of the men who took the initiative in the plans leading to its organization. Prominently identified with the work of organization were Judge John W. Woods, D. M. Taylor, Ballard P. Huff, and N. W. Phelps. The capital stock of $200,000 was promptly subscribed, and the bank entered upon a career which has been one of gratifying success from the very outset. The business is conducted at No. 111 South Jefferson Street, and in conjunction with a general banking business there is a savings department, which pays four per cent. interest on time deposits. The bank is well equipped to serve the requirements of its patrons, and each succeeding statement has shown an appreciable increase in the volume of business transacted. Its capitalization is $200,000 with surplus and undivided profits amounting to $65,000 and deposits in excess of $800,000. Hon. John W. Woods is President of the bank; D. M. Taylor and Ballard Huff, Vice Presidents, and N. W. Phelps, Cashier, each having served in the capacity mentioned from the date of organization. These officers are all men of long experience in History of Roanoke City—Industrial financial and business affairs, and are eminently qualified to manage with judgment and precision the interests entrusted to their care. The personnel of the management insures conservatism and regard for the interests of the bank's patrons, and the clerical staff is efficient and careful in the discharge of its duty. Courtesy and friendly interest have marked the relations of the management and staff with the public, and this policy of coöperation has served to win friends for the institution and add to its popularity. The favor with which its administration of affairs has been received and the confidence reposed in the bank by the public are attested by the splendid progress made since its organization. The signal success already attained gives promise of continued growth and a prominent place in financial circles, as the bank's stability and influence are firmly established, and its future assured. The officers and board of directors are men prominently connected with the various business and manufacturing interests of the city, and are as follows: Officers: John W. Woods, President; N. W. Phelps, Cashier; D. M. Taylor, Vice President; B. P. Huff, Vice President. Directors: John W. Woods, B. P. Huff, S. H. Heironimus, George W. Payne, T. R. Tillett, W. S. McClanahan, Charles I.

VIRGINIA COLLEGE FOR YOUNG WOMEN Virginia College ranks among the foremost Colleges in the South for the higher education of women, and was founded in 1893 by Dr. William Anderson Harris, who for twenty-seven years was President of the Wesleyan Female Institute in Staunton, Virginia. Since the death of Dr. Harris in 1895, the College has been PARTIAL VIEW OF COLLEGE under the able management of his two daughters, Miss Mattie P. Harris and Mrs. Gertrude Harris Boatwright. The College location is ideal, occupying ten acres of campus, and on an eminence several hundred feet above the city of Roanoke, commanding a panoramic view of the Blue Ridge and Alleghany Mountains which, for grandeur, is unsurpassed in the historical Shenandoah Valley. The College is situated half a mile from Roanoke, the students thus enjoying all the advantages of a country life, yet having access by electric cars to all parts of the city. The buildings are arranged with special reference to the safety, health, comfort, and convenience of the students, and in addition to the rooms of the Faculty and students, contain a large auditorium, study hall, dining room, parlors, offices, music rooms, lecture rooms, chemical and domestic science laboratories, reading room, art studio, infirmary, etc. The Faculty has been carefully selected from the leading universities and colleges of America and Europe, the management having spared neither trouble nor expense in making Virginia College all that could be desired in a school for effective educational work. The Virginia College recognizes that many students desire to specialize for one or two years, and offers elective courses in Music, Art, Expression and Domestic Science in addition to the regular four years' Collegiate Course leading to the A. B. Degree. Virginia College has a national reputation, and is represented by about one hundred and fifty students from over thirty-two states and one or two foreign countries. ROANOKE IRON WORKS, INCORPORATED The Roanoke Iron Works, Incorporated, was established in 1907, through the consolidation of two large iron working enterprises of Roanoke, Virginia, both of ONE OF THE MANY PRODUCTS which had been in successful operation for a number of years. This consolidation was brought about with the view of enlargement and the covering of a broader field. Since that time there has been a marked improvement in the business, the plant having entered extensively into the manufacture of structural and architectural steel. The plant is one of the most complete iron working establishments of the South and besides the lines mentioned, machine shops, iron and brass foundry, pattern works, wire and brass works, as well as a number of other departments, including general repairs, are conducted. During its brief existence the firm has made shipments to New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Nebraska, New Mexico, Mexico, and Canada. A general trade has also been established in all the Southern States. The spiral stairway, a half tone of which accompanies this sketch, was manufactured by the Roanoke Iron Works, Incorporated, for the United States Government, and is but one of the many hundreds of items turned out for the trade. History of Roanoke City—Industrial The officers of the Company are: H. E. Obenshain, President; R. H. Angell, Vice President, and C. A. Moomaw, Secretary and Treasurer. Mr. H. E.

MARSTELLER MARBLE WORKS This business was established in Roanoke in 1887, the plant at that time being located at No. 503 South Jefferson Street. After conducting a successful business for a period of ten years, Mr. J. H. Marsteller, the proprietor, erected in 1897, a three-story structure at No. 21 East Campbell Avenue, in order to meet the growing requirements of his trade. This building covers an area of fifty by two hundred feet and in the front portion are handsome show rooms, the plant being located in the rear. This is the largest and most important house of the kind in the State of Virginia, and is the largest purchaser of monumental work in the country. About two years ago the old established plant operated by J. I. Van Ness, Church Street, Lynchburg, Virginia, was purchased and added to the business of the Marsteller Marble Works. This addition places the works in a position to give prompt service to its rapidly growing trade in the section tributary to Lynchburg, and this branch has become an important factor in the business. The trade of the Marsteller Marble Works extends throughout Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, and North Carolina, and the house bears a high reputation for the artistic design and excellent quality of its products. THE MODEL GARAGE This handsome structure is located at No. 16 East Church Avenue and was completed about two years ago. Mr. Marsteller is an enthusiastic automobilist, and his frequent tours throughout the country suggested the advisability of having a first class garage located at Roanoke for the benefit of tourists and to accommodate local business. The Model Garage was accordingly built and covers a space fifty by one hundred feet with additional storage space in the rear covering two thousand five hundred square feet, and in many respects surpasses any building of the kind in the State of Virginia. The building is three stories in height, fireproof throughout, and is one of the handsomest and best equipped garages in the whole country. It is, as its name implies, a "Model" garage, and is complete in all essentials with supplies and accessories of every description for the accommodation of tourists and local patrons. It is commented upon by tourists as being the best equipped garage between New York and Jacksonville, and as rendering prompt and efficient service at all times. J. H.

These catalogues will be sent to prospective students on application. VIRGINIA LUMBER MANUFACTURING COMPANY The Virginia Lumber Manufacturing Company was organized in December, 1906. Robert H. Angell is President; John H. Yost, Vice President and General Manager; R. E. L. Abbitt, Secretary and Treasurer; E. D. Myers, Mill Superintendent, and James T. Baker, Yard Superintendent. All of these men are known for their excellent business qualifications, and they have been actively engaged in the upbuilding of Roanoke. Located near the center of the business district, the office and mill being at the corner of Roanoke Street and Salem Avenue, for the past five years, the firm has taken front rank in the advancement of PARTIAL VIEW OF PLANT the city. It has been the intention of the firm to handle everything in the building line, except hardware. The mill work of this firm is high grade in every particular and quite a reputation has been established in the manufacture of mantels, office furniture, store fronts, store fixtures in hardwoods, such as mahogany, maple, oak, birch, ash, poplar, and other material, such as yellow pine, long leaf, and short leaf pine. A specialty has been made of all kinds of furniture and fixtures in short leaf Alabama pine, and the results have been eminently satisfactory to customers and patrons. From forty-five to fifty people are regularly employed and often during the busy season more help is needed. First-class mechanics are always employed by this institution which has been a prominent factor in the upbuilding of Roanoke. The yards of the Virginia History of Roanoke City—Industrial Lumber Manufacturing Company are located nearby with ample railroad siding, and the firm is a large purchaser of building material from the best markets of the South and East.

The trade of this firm extends beyond the limits of the city and it numbers among its customers leading contractors and builders in Bedford City, Radford, Dublin, Buchanan, Martinsville, and intermediate points. A trade specialty is made in the handling of high-grade paints, oil, lime, patent wall plaster, and cement. The oak veneered doors handled almost exclusively by this firm compare favorably with Morgan &amp; Payne's products, and many contractors declare that they are superior to anything on the market. THE EVENING WORLD The Evening World of Roanoke was established December 23d, 1889, by A. H. Dooley, J. H. Ackerley, and Charles Cox, and continued under the joint management of these gentlemen until 1894. In the latter part of that year the World Printing Company was organized with A. H. Dooley as President and Manager, and the Evening World has since been under his supervision. On December 23d, 1910, the paper celebrated its twenty-first anniversary by the publication of an anniversary edition, in which was published a summary of what the city of Roanoke had accomplished in the twenty-one years in which the Evening World had been a factor in its upbuilding and advancement. To-day the Evening World enjoys a fine circulation, and is regarded as one of the leading afternoon dailies of the State, and the only afternoon paper in Virginia west of Richmond giving the full associated press news' reports, covering the happenings of the entire world up to the hour of going to press each afternoon. The World now occupies handsome quarters at No. 303 South Jefferson Street, with the business department and press on the first floor. The mechanical department, consisting of linotype machines, composing equipment, and reportorial rooms are on the second floor, while the editorial rooms are located on the third floor of the handsome building. The Evening World is printed on a duplex flat bed perfecting press with a speed of six thousand eight to twelve page papers per hour, printing from the web, direct from the form, and is invaluable as a timesaver. This press brings out a clear print from all light faced type and fine screen half tone cuts. When the Evening World made its bow to the public twenty-two years ago, it announced as its editorial policy "the unceasing advocacy of industrial progress; the inculcation of sound morality, and the dissemination of healthy political doctrines." It has made an honest endeavor to live up to this declaration, and to-day it stands forth as the beacon light for conservatism, reliability, and for the good of the community. That it has been an important factor in the upbuilding of Roanoke and Southwest Virginia, all must admit. Mr. A. H. Dooley, the President and Manager of the World Printing Company is a native of Bedford County, Virginia, but removed to Roanoke when quite a young man. He has been a great factor in the city's development, morally and industrially, both he and his paper standing for high ideals, and all that is best in American life. John M. Miles, the present Editor of the Evening World is a newspaper man of wide and varied experience. For a long period of time he was with the Lynchburg News, and afterwards was identified with the Roanoke Times and Evening News for a period of six years. Upon the death of the late editor, James M. Williams, Mr. Miles assumed the editorship of the Evening World which position he is filling to the entire satisfaction of the management of the paper and to the public in general. He is a conservative, virile writer, and is daily injecting a zest into the editorial columns of the paper which leads other Southern journals to reproduce his thoughts and ideas. The city editorial department of the Evening World for the past twelve years has been in charge of John W. Sherman a native of Lynchburg, Virginia, and an old experienced newspaper man. Noted for his conservatism and his untiring devotion to his work, no man possesses the confidence and respect of the people of his city to a greater degree. He is the author of a number of dramas, which have been popular on the stage. Much of his time and talents have been devoted to theatrical work. THE SHENANDOAH HOTEL Among the new hotels in Virginia, none will compare more favorably in appointment and in general adaptation to the wants of the traveling public, than the Shenandoah Hotel. This new and modern hostelry is situated within two blocks of the Norfolk &amp; Western station and directly opposite the general station and waiting room of the Roanoke Railway and Electric Company, in two squares of the three national banks SHENANDOAH HOTEL of the city and in close touch with the great shopping district.

The building with the new addition recently completed contains one hundred and one rooms. The new addition contains twenty-eight rooms with bath and running water in every room in this part of the house. No hotel in the State can boast of being better furnished than the Shenandoah. A modern and up-to-date restaurant and grill-room is run in connection with the History of Roanoke City—Industrial hotel and this feature has proved to be a paying venture. The grill-room was fitted out at an expense of more than six thousand dollars, and is in charge of M. E. Stokeley a most competent caterer, and is recognized by the business man and the travelin public as the very best in the country. The success of the Shenandoah is due largely to the genial proprietor, Mr. W. T. Barbour, one of the best and most widely known hotel men in the Virginias and Kentucky. He numbers among his relatives and connections some of the first families in the states above mentioned, and his charming wife, who makes her home in the hotel, is a hostess whom all are proud to honor. The desk of the Shenandoah is presided over by Mr. Henry S. Grogan, during the day and A. G. Sims at night, both are well known to the traveling public, are popular in their respective places and both are contributing their share of energy in the upbuilding of this popular hostelry. This hotel was recently erected by Mr. J. S. Perry, one of Roanoke's leading capitalists and business men. Mr. Perry maintains a handsome office in the hotel. The Shenandoah is Roanoke's newest and most up-to-date hotel and traveling men say without hesitation that it is a most excellent place of entertainment and a distinct credit to the city. No expense was spared in fitting it up, the very best of everything which goes to provide comfort for the traveler was secured and placed in position before the hotel finally opened its doors. This hotel is elaborately furnished, all rooms are outside rooms, thus insuring perfect ventilation, which is to be considered in selecting a stopping place when traveling. The Shenandoah Hotel is conducted on the European plan, the rates ranging from $1.00 per day upward. THE COLONIAL BANK AND TRUST COMPANY The Colonial Bank and Trust Company, was organized and opened its doors for business August 1st, 1910, and while it is the youngest of Roanoke's banking institutions, it is forging ahead rapidly and during the past twelve months more than doubled its deposits. This bank has an authorized capital of $300,000 and is under control of the State Government to which it submits sworn reports and is regularly examined by the State Bank Examiners. The Colonial Bank and Trust Company does a general banking business and each department is in charge of thoroughly competent men, fitted by years of experience to render patrons a high class and reliable service.

The Trust Department acts as executor, trustee, guardian, depository for securities or agent in any financial transaction. The Safe Deposit Department is equipped with various size safety boxes. The vault is both fire and burglar proof, which makes it doubly secure. Mr. T. H. Cooper was the first President of the Colonial Bank and Trust Company and at his death a few months ago was succeeded by E. W. Mollohan, of Washington, D. C., who accepted the position temporarily. R. H. Angell was unanimously elected President about three months ago, and the following roster comprises the other officers: W. W. Boxley, Vice President; E. W. Tinsley, Cashier and Treasurer; George M. Dickerson, Secretary, and J. T. Davenport, Assistant Treasurer. The directors are as follows: R. H. Angell, W. W. Boxley, L. N. Buford, Edw. S.

HOME OF THE COLONIAL BANK AND TRUST COMPANY The officers and directors of the bank are among the leading representative business men in this city and section, and their names are an absolute guarantee of solidity and safety. The home of the Colonial Bank and Trust Company is located at No. 116 Campbell Avenue, West, and they occupy the building formerly used by the American Savings Bank and especially erected for banking purposes. History of Roanoke City—Industrial THE GRIGGS PACKING COMPANY Among the important enterprises in Roanoke City which has accomplished something in the way of the city's material advancement may be mentioned the plant of the Griggs Packing Company located on the south side of Roanoke River near the Franklin Road bridge. This enterprise was established in 1906 as a pork packing and cold storage plant, it being the aim of the proprietors to store and care for their own products. It soon became apparent that a larger storage capacity was in demand, and the forty thousand cubic feet of storage space of the original plant was enlarged. When the business was first organized the old farm plan of butchering was followed. The meats were put in storage and afterwards cured by the old hickory wood process. There was a steady and increasing demand for these "country cured" products in the shape of hams, shoulders and side meat. Two years ago a modern hog killing plant was installed on the plan of the great slaughtering plants of Chicago and Kansas City together with a complete lard renovating outfit of the latest and most improved machinery. PARTIAL VIEW OF THE PLANT The capacity of the plant is now one hundred hogs per hour or more than one per minute. The hogs are unloaded from cars and penned beneath the plant. A loop is drawn over the hind feet when the animal is lifted by machinery, and as it goes up, an expert sticker drives a long knife into the animal's throat, and, without stopping, it is carried on an overhead trolley to the scalding vat where scrapers are put to work automatically. As the machinery lifts the hog from the vat, another expert with drawn knife by a single stroke dresses it. The "dressed" carcass is passed on to the cooling room where in a short time it is ready for the carving table. All this is accomplished in the remarkably short time of thirty-six seconds from the time a hog is lifted from its feet in the pen below. The by-products of the plant, such as a pure leaf lard, sausage, pudding meats, etc., find a ready sale among the merchants and local meat dealers of the city. The Griggs Packing Company purchase their hogs in carload lots from Southwest Virginia and the Middle Western markets. Three years ago the company installed a modern ice making plant which is supplied with water from an artesian well over two hundred feet in depth. The capacity of the ice plant was recently enlarged to a volume of one hundred tons daily and a further enlargement is contemplated in order to meet the growing demand for the ice manufactured, it being of a superior grade and as clear as crystal. Plans have already been prepared and early in the spring additional storage room for forty thousand barrels of apples will be built at a cost of about $35,000. When completed this will make the storage capacity for the Griggs Packing Company, perhaps the largest in Virginia. Every foot of the present storage room was purchased by apple packers early in the season, and during the past year the concern was forced to deny to their customers much desired space. The cold storage plant sustains a splendid reputation, the percentage of loss being so small as to hardly be noticeable. Compared with losses sustained last year from apples picked and barreled from the same orchard, a portion of which was stored here and a portion which went into a cold storage in New York, the percentage in favor of the Griggs Packing Company was very large. The plant may be regarded as an important adjunct to the business life of the city. From twenty-five to forty men are employed the year round at good wages, and the constant additions which have become necessary within the past five years is an evidence of the enterprise and prosperity of the plant. The officers of the Griggs Packing Company are as follows: Robert B. Griggs, President and General Manager; M. L. Griggs, Vice President; Otho S. Griggs, Secretary and Treasurer. These gentlemen with George C. Huff of Washington County constitute the Board of Directors. ROBERT BYRON GRIGGS Robert Byron Griggs, the third son of the late Samuel and Eva (Kefauver) Griggs, was born in Roanoke County, July 14th, 1861, and when a boy attended the schools of the county and Big Lick. He began life on his father's farm, being eminently successful as a farmer. Realizing the possibilities of the packing, cold storage, and ice manufacturing business in this section, he organized the Griggs Packing Company, of which he is President. So eminently successful has the operation of the plant under his personal supervision been, that several enlargements have resulted. History of Roanoke City—Industrial On November 20th, 1890, Robert Byron Griggs married Hallie Meade, daughter of Oliver G. Meade, of Bedford County, Virginia, and to them five children have been born, all of whom are living, as follows: Elizabeth, aged sixteen; Robert G., aged eleven; Evelyn, aged seven; Ruth, aged five, and Hallie Meade, aged three years. VIRGINIA METAL AND CULVERT COMPANY INCORPORATED In the year 1907 a copartnership was formed between Mr. L. C. Stewart and Mr. M. A. Quinn in Richmond and established a firm to be known as the Virginia Metal Culvert Company. The business of this company was started on a very small scale and with a very limited plant. Time, however, increased the demand for the product marketed (corrugated culvert pipe and sheet metal specialties) to a considerable extent which necessitated the securing of larger quarters and a more favorable location in 1908. Considering the railroad facilities and others with which a location in Roanoke would be identified, the firm decided to move its plant to this city since which time the business has shown a further consistent increase. Continuous and energetic efforts and the manufacture of a high-class culvert pipe enabled the company to gradually increase the capacity of its plant which finally culminated in its incorporation of $150,000 in the year 1911 as the Virginia Metal and Culvert Company, Incorporated, A HIGHWAY CULVERT with Mr. L. C. Stewart as President and Treasurer; Mr. M. A. Quinn, Vice President, and Mr. J. A. Maness, Secretary While the business organized and transacted in Richmond was decidedly confined to a small one, at the present time the corrugated culvert pipe has gained a national reputation and is used in every State in the Union. ROANOKE MARBLE AND GRANITE WORKS The Roanoke Marble and Granite Works, Incorporated, were established in 1908, and were chartered the following year. This has been one of the city's most successful enterprises, and has been a large advertiser of Roanoke, as the manufactured goods of this concern are sent all over Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Florida, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, as well as other states. The firm manufactures all kinds of granite and marble monuments and tombstones, and building stone for interior marble decoration. PARTIAL VIEW OF PLANT A specialty is made of tombstone work which is shipped to all parts of the country. Much imported statuary is handled by this progressive firm. One or more representatives are located in every county in Southwest Virginia, and in this way, and through traveling representatives a large territory is systematically covered. The business is increasing rapidly, largely due to the facts that only the very best material is used, skilled labor employed, and the prices charged are consistent with the high class of work done. All of their work is done by hand, no pneumatic tools being used. This progressive firm has been awarded contracts for the erection of a number of handsome monuments in this immediate section of the State. The handsome monument erected to the Confederate dead at Rocky Mount, in Franklin County, was recently completed by the Roanoke Marble and Granite Works. Mr. J. E. Boone, a native of Franklin County, Virginia, is the General Manager of the plant, and associated with him are Messrs. M. E. Muire, M. H. Cannady, and O. H. Martin. These gentlemen are well known, and all possess the highest business qualifications. Their plant is located at No. 503 South Jefferson Street, near the business center of the city, where one of the largest stocks of fine monuments and tombstones to be found in the State is on exhibition. The firm also handles all kinds of iron fencing, as well as cemetery work of every description. Building stone is also included in their line of trade. SOUTHERN CHEMICAL COMPANY The Southern Chemical Company, manufacturers of high-grade fertilizer at Roanoke, Virginia, was organized and incorporated in 1904, the officers being as follows: R. S. McCluer, President; L. H. Brugh, Vice President; W. H. McCluer, Secretary and Treasurer. This enterprise has been conducting business for the past seven years, operating a large manufacturing plant in the northeast section of the city. Its experimental period in the manufacture of high-grade fertilizer has been past and the firm is now in position to offer goods in this line which will in every way get History of Roanoke City—Industrial best results. An analysis of fertilizer found in the bulletin issued by the Agricultural Department of Virginia shows that the fertilizer manufactured by the Southern Chemical Company is of the highest grade and has given highly satisfactory results. The material used in the Company's products year after year and its use by the largest packers and farmers of the country has proven the value of the goods manufactured. Among the brands which have gained a reputation throughout Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina, may be mentioned the "Harvest King," for general grain and grass growing; "Our Favorite," suitable for both spring and fall crops; "Tobacco Grower," prepared with a special view of supplying the tobacco raiser with a satisfactory fertilizer; "Truckers Friend," a most suitable brand for persons wishing bountiful crops and early vegetables; "Farmer's Friend," one of the most economical fertilizers used; "Our Leader," excellent for spring crops; "Crescent," a cheap fertilizer for corn and oats; "Wheat and Grass," has been used with excellent results; "Southern Queen," one of the best fertilizers made; "Potash Mixture," used extensively where a cheap fertilizer is wanted; "Valley Chief," a most popular brand, used extensively by the best farmers and packers in the State; "Bone Mixture," manufactured for both spring FACTORY AND WAREHOUSE OF THE SOUTHERN CHEMICAL COMPANY and fall crops; "Success," used extensively in raising potatoes and cabbage; "Tomato Special," prepared at the request of many prominent packers, is a perfect fertilizer for tomatoes; "Giant Grower," specially adapted for crops not requiring a high percentage of potash; "Pure Rawbone Meal," as well as a number of other high-grade brands. The gentlemen who are connected with this enterprise are well known business men with many years' experience. They are public spirited citizens and take special pride in the growth and development of the city. DOMINION METAL PRODUCTS CORPORATION Roanoke's newest enterprise is the Dominion Metal Products Corporation, a concern that will be in active operation by the fifteenth of March. This is a Roanoke enterprise, backed by Roanoke capital and will be managed by Roanoke men. The Dominion Metal Products Corporation was organized in 1911, with an authorized capital of $150,000 of which $50,000 has been paid in with $50,000 common stock and $50,000 treasury stock. This stock is owned almost exclusively by local people, therefore the Roanoke Metal Products Corporation is a home enterprise. The plant, now in course of erection, is located on Walnut Street, contiguous to the Norfolk &amp; Western and Virginian Railways, and their shipping facilities will be unsurpassed. This plant will manufacture corrugated metal culverts, general sheet metal products, metal ceiling, sheet metal roofing and siding, metal shingles, eaves, PLANT OF DOMINION METAL PRODUCTS CORPORATION trough, and conductor pipe. They will make a specialty in the use of No-Co-Ro metal which is rust resisting and "Acme (nestable) and Imperial" riveted culverts. The plant which is fifty by two hundred feet will be of steel construction, the outside covered with a steel product of the concern, representing brick and stone, and covered with a steel tiling, another product of the plant. The officers of the Dominion Metal Products Corporation are: James B. Botts, President and General Manager; P. H. Tucker, Secretary and Treasurer, and J. W. Hancock, Vice President. The directors are James P. Woods, J. W. Hancock, Perry Van Horne of Canton, Ohio, James B. Botts, O. A. Kearns, E. C. McComb, and P. H. Tucker. These gentlemen are all well known in this city and section and their names are an absolute guarantee of solidity and safety. When completed this enterprise will furnish employment to a large number of skilled laborers and will add greatly to Roanoke's prestige as an industrial center. THE VIRGINIA BREWING COMPANY AND THE CONSOLIDATED ICE COMPANY The Virginia Brewing Company was organized by Roanoke capitalists in December, 1889, and its growth has been steady and substantial, until it now ranks among the leading enterprises of the city which give employment to numbers of men. Hermann Cruger of Roanoke and Louis A. Scholz of Baltimore were prominent in the organization of the Company and after it was chartered Hermann Cruger was elected President, Jas. R. Schick, Secretary, and Louis A. Scholz, Manager. Mr. Scholz later succeeded to the Presidency of the Company and has been actively identified with the management of its affairs from its organization to the present time. The Virginia Brewing Company was first capitalized at $50,000 and in 1892 this was increased to $80,000, as the business expanded and more capital was required. The Company's business continued to develop to such magnitude that in 1905 the capitalization was made $250,000. The land on which the plant is located comprises four acres and the buildings are of brick, modern in all particulars, and equipped with every facility for the requirements of the business. The capacity of the plant is fifty thousand barrels per annum and the bottling department's capacity is History of Roanoke City—Industrial four hundred thousand dozen bottles per year. Soft drinks are also manufactured. Throughout the entire process of manufacture the product is surrounded by hygienic safeguards, and the utmost cleanliness and care are exercised in every department of the business. The result is, that a high-class product is assured, and its purity and excellence are maintained at all times. The steadily increasing demand attests the popularity of the Virginia Brewing Company's output. The Company's main trade extends throughout Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF VIRGINIA BREWING COMPANY and Tennessee, while orders are also received from many other parts of the South. The plant has been added to from time to time in order to provide facilities for a constantly increasing business, and when a disastrous fire occurred a few years ago it was practically rebuilt, so that very little of the original structure is now standing. One of the plants of the Consolidated Ice Company, in which the Virginia Brewing Company is largely interested, is located immediately next to its premises. This ice company, which operates two factories, was consolidated with the Virginia Brewing Company's ice plant several years ago, and it is now one of the largest ice factories and cold storage houses in the State. Its capitalization is $75,000 and its capacity is one hundred tons daily. These enterprises give employment to one hundred and fifty persons and have been operated continuously since their organization. Louis A. Scholz is President of both companies and Henry Scholz, Secretary and Treasurer of both. They are among Roanoke's most substantial and enterprising citizens, and have always contributed from their means and taken an active part in plans for the furtherance of the city's interests, and the expansion of its business. They are prominently identified and interested financially in the Cooper Silica and Glass Company, which owns an immense deposit of high-grade glass sand in the county of Roanoke; and are also large stockholders in the Roanoke Fair Association, which holds annual exhibitions, and has become known as one of the best fairs held in the South. They have been energetic and broad minded in the conduct of their business, and have acquired a reputation for fair dealing and conservatism which has gained for them the respect of the community. ROANOKE SANITARIUM, INCORPORATED Among the many enterprises of Roanoke, there are none more deserving of space in this volume. The home of this worthy institution is none other than the old Powell mansion, so familiar to all Roanokers. It is within the corporate limits of Roanoke, the Magic City, No. 1906 Salem Avenue, West, on the most commanding height giving a clear view of the entire city and the surrounding territory. The elevation is one thousand feet and the beautiful mountain scenery gives a feeling of inspiration and rest to the over-wrought mind. The building cost a large sum to erect. The location, the convenience, the care and comfort of the patients, coupled with the fact that competent management and medical skill administers to the needs of those coming here for treatment, make the Sanitarium second to no other in the country. The Roanoke Sanitarium, Incorporated, was chartered under the laws of Virginia in May, 1911, and had its initial opening in the early part of June, 1911. The success of this enterprise has been greater than was anticipated. The officers are: J. P. Flippo, President, J. H. History of Roanoke City—Industrial Morris, Secretary; Dr. W. S. Slicer, Physician in Charge and Treasurer. The directors are: J. P. Flippo and Dr. W. S. Slicer, of Roanoke; and Dr. S. H. Price, of Montvale, Virginia. The Roanoke Sanitarium, Incorporated, treats all kinds of nervous and mental diseases, it also treats the liquor disease in all its forms and all kinds of drug addictions, making this an institution worthy of earnest support by all having in mind that upbuilding of man means the upbuilding of a community. The physician in charge is a well-known and prominent doctor of Roanoke. VIEW OF THE ROANOKE SANITARIUM—FRONT WALTER S. SLICER, M. D. Dr. Walter Stevenson Slicer, son of Captain J. S. Slicer and Eliza Williams Slicer, was born at Montvale, in Bedford County, Virginia, March, 1880. He attended the Montvale Sub-Collegiate School, afterwards coming to Roanoke and beginning his active career in the employ of the Charles Lyle Drug Company, and at the age of eighteen years he had charge of what was then known as the White Front Pharmacy, now McGee's Drug Store. In 1900 he entered the University College of Medicine, Richmond, Virginia, graduating four years later at the age of twenty-four. Immediately after graduation he was offered and accepted the position as Physician and Surgeon for the Virginia Iron, Coal and Coke Company, and the Pulaski Iron Company, located at Cripple Creek, Virginia, where he served until 1909, when he moved to Roanoke. Besides being a regular physician enjoying a large practice in Roanoke, he is Physician in Charge of the Roanoke Sanitarium, Incorporated, Surgeon for the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway and Assistant Surgeon for the Lewis-Gale Hospital. He is a member of the American Medical Association, Virginia Medical Society, Medical Society of Southwest Virginia, Roanoke Academy of Medicine, and Norfolk &amp; Western Surgeons' Association. Dr. Slicer has the confidence and esteem of the people wherever he has been and enjoys a high place in the estimation of the people of Roanoke and vicinity. THE S. P. HITE COMPANY, INCORPORATED The S. P. Hite Company, Incorporated, with a paid in capital stock of $50,000 became a permanent fixture and a part of Roanoke's industrial and commercial life in the fall of 1905. The stock is held by about thirty of Roanoke's leading business men. The chief business of the enterprise is the manufacture of Hite's Pain Remedy, a well-known household remedy, flavoring extracts, and a number of staple drugs, proprietary and toilet articles some of which are as follows: "Hites Pain Remedy," Bay Rum, Blood Purifier, Camphor Ice, Cold Cream, Cologne, Cough Syrup, Flavoring Extracts and Oils, Hair Vigor, Laxative Quinine Tablets, Liver Regulator, Talcum Powder, Tasteless Caster Oil, Toothache Drops, Tooth Powder, Paregoric, Quinine Pills, Sewing Machine Oil, Sweet Oil, Spirits Nitre, Tincture Iron, Turpentine, and Witch Hazel. The Company owns a large four and one-half story brick building in which it operates, and its property extends from Center to Loudon avenues, between Third and Fourth streets, Northwest. It was in 1871 that Dr. S. P. Hite began the manufacture of Hite's Pain Remedy at Moffett's Creek, Virginia. It was first carried around by the manufacturer in his saddle bags. Later he fitted out a nice wagon, in which he drove over the country, introducing and demonstrating the remedy. Later he removed to Staunton, Virginia, where he operated until the fall of History of Roanoke City—Industrial 1905 when the business was purchased by a number of Roanoke gentlemen and incorporated. The present officers are: W. E. Price, President; S. P. Hite, Vice President; B. J. Fishburne, Secretary, Treasurer and Manager. To-day Hite's Pain Remedy is a household remedy and just as staple as any household article in the homes of the people of Virginia and adjoining states. In 1908 the firm began the manufacture of flavoring extracts, staple drugs, proprietary and toilet articles, some seventy or eighty in number, which are becoming well known and of general use in the territory in which they have been introduced. A corps of traveling salesmen are kept on the road at all times in Virginia and the nearby states. Last year the business of this concern increased in volume over forty per cent. on a gain of about the same as the previous year. THE SUNNYSIDE AWNING COMPANY INCORPORATED Among the successful enterprises of this city there is not one with brighter prospects for the future than that of the Sunnyside Awning Company, located on the second floor of the Hartsook Building on the Market Square. The officers of the Company are: H. H. Markley, President; S. B. Pace, Vice President; F. L. Temple, Secretary and Treasurer. Mr. Temple is also General Manager. He is an expert awning and tent man and gives to the business his own personal supervision. The Sunnyside Awning Company are the owners and manufacturers of the "Sunnyside Awning," which is fully covered and protected by patents, and QUARTERS OF THE SUNNYSIDE AWNING COMPANY is especially adapted to use on residences and offices. Beside the manufacture of this particular awning, all kinds and styles of awnings for stores, offices and residences, wagon covers, horse covers, tarpaulins, and tents are made to order, and on the shortest possible notice. The manufacture of high-grade mattresses is also a part of the business of the firm. Since opening up business three years ago the trade of the Sunnyside Awning Company has extended into North and South Carolina and into Eastern Virginia. Several traveling salesmen are kept on the road, and while the concern may be regarded as small at the present time there is every indication that it will grow to be one of Roanoke's most valuable enterprises.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">HISTORY OF THE NORFOLK &amp; WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY By E. B. JACOBS FREDERICK J. KIMBALL President N. &amp; W. Ry., 1883 to 1895 and 1902 to 1903 FREDERICK J. KIMBALL Frederick J. Kimball, with whose name is linked the history of the early development of the city of Roanoke, and in fact the important events in the early operations of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway throughout Southwest Virginia and the West Virginia coal fields, was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, March 6th, 1844. In 1862 he entered the railroad service as a rodman in the engineering department of the Erie Branch of the Pennsylvania Railroad, where he served for four years, after which he spent two years of study in railroad shops and kindred industries in England. During the next ten years he engaged in various engineering and railroad enterprises, until he became identified with the active construction work of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad in 1878. One of the leading spirits in the construction of this line, and realizing the wonderful advantages to be gained through a connection with the Norfolk &amp; Western, he was prominent in the work of pushing this plan to completion. In May, 1881, before the connection at Roanoke had been made, he was elected President of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad, and at the same time was made Vice President of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad, serving in the latter position until June, 1883, when he became President of the Norfolk &amp; Western, and acted in that capacity for a period of twelve years. On February 6th, 1895, he was appointed a Receiver of the road along with Henry Fink, and served in that position until its reorganization in October, 1896, under the name of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway, when he was made Chairman of the Board. He occupied that position until March, 1902, when he was elected President of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway, and held that office until the time of his death, which occurred in July, 1903. Frederick J. Kimball was one of the pioneers in the important work of railroad construction throughout Southwest Virginia and the coal fields. During the early investigations made to determine the resources of the country, he visited the section which has since become the greatest source of coal supply in the South, and spent days in studying the situation. He thus familiarized himself with conditions, and when he became the official head of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad he maugurated plans for building additional branch lines throughout the coal fields, and for placing the main track in an improved condition, in order to properly care for the heavy increase in traffic which he felt confident would come. His expectations were fully realized, and it was but a few years until he found it necessary to recommend double-tracking the line from Radford to Lynchburg, in order to give adequate service to a traffic which overtaxed the road's transportation facilities. This work was undertaken and finished with the result that coal shipments and the general business of the Company increased to a very appreciable extent. Throughout his long and active connection with the management of the Norfolk &amp; Western, Mr. Kimball possessed unbounded faith in the resources and possibilities of Southwest Virginia and the coal fields, and inaugurated plans on an extensive scale for the general development of this vast section, and the marketing of its products. He lived to see the Norfolk &amp; Western develop from a road of five hundred and three miles, (which was the extent of the line operated May 21st, 1883, when the New River Division was opened) to a railway operating one thousand seven hundred and twenty-two miles in 1903, with excellent transportation facilities and one of the greatest coal-carrying roads in the country. Mr. Kimball visited Roanoke at the time the citizens of Big Lick (the former name of the city) met to mature plans for the connection of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad with the Norfolk &amp; Western at that point, and manifested a deep interest in the place, which at that period was a mere village of a few hundred inhabitants. From that time until his death he possessed faith in Roanoke's future, and in many ways gave tangible evidence of his interest in the city's progress and welfare. Erected on the plaza in front of the Norfolk &amp; Western passenger station at Roanoke is a handsome drinking fountain, placed there in honor of Mr. Kimball, and in recognition of his uniform kindness and care for dumb animals, manifested in many ways throughout his life. Mr. Kimball's memory is cherished by the people of Roanoke as that of a man to whose foresight and business judgment were largely due the extensive plans for railroad extension throughout Southwest Virginia, which resulted in opening up vast sections for cultivation and minig, and brought their products to the markets of the world; and for the strong personal interest shown by him in every forward movement for the upbuilding of the city of Roanoke. HENRY FINK President N. &amp; W. Ry., 1896 to 1902 HENRY FINK Henry Fink, whose name has been associated with the construction and management of railroads throughout the South for half a century, was born in Germany, November 29th, 1831, and was educated in the Polytechnic School at Darmstadt. His first position in railroad service was that of rodman and transitman for the Western Maryland Railroad in 1851. During 1851 and 1852, he was typographer and draughtsman on surveys and location of the Parkersburg Branch of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, and occupied the position of resident engineer in the construction of the same branch from 1852 to 1855. He entered the service of the Norfolk &amp; Petersburg Railroad as Resident Engineer in charge of construction, and acted in that capacity from 1855 to 1858, when he was made Master of Road and Master of Construction, serving as such until 1867. In 1867 he was made Superintendent of Transportation of the Norfolk &amp; Petersburg Railroad and also Superintendent of Transportation of the South Side and the Virginia &amp; Tennessee Railroads; which position he occupied until 1871, when he was made Superintendent of Transportation of the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad upon the organization of the same, and occupied that position until 1876. From 1876 to 1881 he occupied the position of General Manager and Receiver of the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad, and upon the acquisition of the line by the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad in 1881 he was made Second-Vice President and General Manager of the latter Company, and acted in that capacity until 1883. From 1881 to 1885, he also held the position of Vice President and General Manager of the East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia Railway, and was General Manager of the Memphis &amp; Charleston Railroad during the same period. From 1881 to 1888, he was General Manager of the Virginia, Tennessee &amp; Georgia Air Line, and was Receiver of the East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia Railway in 1885-1886. In 1886, he was made Vice President of the East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia Railway, and acted as such until 1892. He held the position of Vice President of the Richmond &amp; Danville Railroad in 1887; Vice President of the Memphis &amp; Charleston Railroad from 1887 to 1892; Vice President of the Cincinnati, New Orleans &amp; Texas Pacific Railroad from 1890 to 1893; Vice President of the Alabama Great Southern Railroad from 1890 to 1893; and was Receiver of the East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia Railway from 1892 to 1895. From 1892 to 1898, he was Receiver of the Memphis &amp; Charleston Railroad, and was a Receiver of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad from 1895 to 1896. On the reorganization of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad, and the change of name of the same to that of the "Norfolk &amp; Western Railway," on October 1st, 1896, he was made President of the Company, and served in that capacity until March 5th, 1902, when he requested to be relieved of the exacting duties of the position, and retired from the Presidency of the Company to become Chairman of the Board, which latter position he now occupies. Throughout his long and successful career in railroad service, Mr. Fink has been actively identified with projects of railroad construction of great magnitude, and of far reaching importance to the territory traversed by the various lines with which he has been officially connected. His management of the large interests intrusted to his care, both as a railroad manager and as receiver, has been marked by ability of a high order; and his intimate knowledge of every branch of the railroad business has enabled him to perform, with judgment and precision, the duties of the important positions he has been called upon to fill. His long connection with the business of the Norfolk &amp; Western lines placed him in a position to be of signal service to the Company during the receivership, and at the time of its reorganization in 1896. During his administration as President of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company, from October, 1896, to March, 1902, construction work and improvements of an important character were engaged upon. New lines were built, miles of second track were laid, the physical condition of the road was improved in a marked degree, and its transportation facilities were brought to a high standard of efficiency. While Mr. Fink has shown marked ability as a constructor and operator, he has, with all this, shown a marvelous knowledge and insight in relation to traffic matters, and his advice and indomitable force of character did as much during the period when rates were in a chaotic condition to maintain stability and uniformity of rates as any other man in this country who has been connected with that part of the railroad service. LUCIUS E. JOHNSON Elected President N. &amp; W. Ry., 1903 LUCIUS E. JOHNSON Lucius E. Johnson, President of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company was born April 13th, 1846, in Aurora, Illinois, and is the son of J. Spencer and Eliza (Brown) Johnson. He received his early education in the public schools of Aurora, and his first connection with railroad work was in the capacity of locomotive fireman on the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad in 1866. After filling various positions in the service of the Company, including that of master mechanic at Aurora, he was promoted in 1886, to the position of Superintendent of the St. Louis Division; and after serving in that capacity for two years, he was made Superintendent of the Chicago Division, which position he occupied until 1890, when he accepted the office of Superintendent of the Montana Central Railway. He continued as Superintendent of the Montana Central for a period of three years, when he resigned to enter the employ of the Lake Shore &amp; Michigan Southern as Superintendent of the Michigan Division of that company, serving from 1893 to 1897. He then removed to Virginia to accept the position of General Superintendent of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway with headquarters at Roanoke, and discharged the duties of that office until 1899, when he was made Vice President and General Manager of the road. On October 1st, 1903, Mr. Johnson was made President and General Manager of the Company. On February 1st, 1904, he was made President of the Norfolk &amp; Western system, and has since occupied that position. Since his connection with the management of the railroad of which he is President, Mr. Johnson has vigorously prosecuted the work of improving the road's physical condition, the increase of its equipment, and the betterment of its general transportation facilities. The plans devised and put into force under his management, have placed every department of the system in position to meet the requirements of a traffic the continued growth of which has been one of the most remarkable in the railroad history of the country. The financial status of the Norfolk &amp; Western has improved from year to year, until the stock is now regarded as one of the best railroad securities in the United States, and all arrangements have been consummated for meeting the financial requirements of future expansion and development of the system. The personnel of the management and working force in the several departments of the Company is of a high character, and efficiency and intelligent service are evidenced in every branch of business connected with the operation of the road. Courtesy and consideration, coupled with a proper observance of business ethics, are required on the part of the Company's employees, with the result that the service of the road has become a model of efficiency. In handling the important interests entrusted to his care, Mr. Johnson has displayed business judgment of a high order, and has been instrumental in developing a most cordial feeling between the public and the management of the great transportation company of which he is the official head. The consideration and kindly coöperation extended the employees of the Company have been instrumental in establishing a most cordial relationship between the men and the Company, and the result of this wise policy is that there has been no strike or serious labor difficulty during the whole time of Mr. Johnson's connection with the management of the road; all questions arising having been settled in a spirit of reciprocity and fairness. His record of achievements, from the beginning of his career as a locomotive fireman, through successive positions of responsibility, until his selection as the President of one of the great trunk line railroads of the country, is one which emphasizes the adage that "There is always room at the top;" providing that faithfulness, loyalty, and a proper appreciation of responsibility are manifested in the discharge of duty. His successful career is an example of what may be attained in life through patience, integrity, and efficiency in the discharge of present responsibilities; these qualifications leading to deserved promotion, commanding confidence, and resulting eventually in the selection for a position requiring business qualifications of the highest order. As a citizen of Roanoke, Mr. Johnson has gained the friendship and esteem of the people through his uniform kindness and personal interest in matters pertaining to the beautification of the city, the improvement of its highways, the enlargement of its public buildings and playgrounds, the adoption of sanitary safeguards, and the betterment of its educational facilities. He has ever responded to calls made upon him as a citizen, and has aided by advice and personal cooperation in bringing to a successful issue undertakings for the general advancement and upbuilding of the city. HISTORY OF THE NORFOLK &amp; WESTERN RAILWAY COMPANY The influence which the building of a railroad exerts in the development of the section of country traversed by its lines, and the substantial benefits accruing therefrom, cause the great transportation companies of the land to be recognized as most prominent factors in the expansion of commerce and industry. The interests of the railroads and those of the manufacturer, the merchant, the mechanic, and the farmer are so closely interwoven, that the effect of the increase or diminution of the traffic of these huge arteries of trade is immediately reflected in conditions pertaining to every class of business. Adequate steam transportation is to-day the most important of all the factors on which depends the growth of the nation's commerce. Railroad transportation enables communities, even though widely separated, to engage in an interchange of traffic, to receive quickly and in abundance the products of the farm, the LAMBERT'S POINT COAL PIERS forest, and the mine, and to convert the same into manufactured articles; affording employment to thousands of people, causing villages to become towns of importance and enabling cities to attain proportions not otherwise possible. But for the service rendered by the railroads, the transportation of all commodities would necessarily be confined within a very restricted area and the manufacturing interests of the country would be unable to conduct their business with either facility or economy. Railroad transportation, however, has reached such a point of efficiency that the journey from coast to coast can be made in the short space of five days by passenger train, and the shipment of freight over the same distance can be accomplished in from fifteen to twenty days, and frequently in less time. In addition to the facilities afforded the general public in the matter of quick transportation and the interchange of traffic, these companies are necessarily heavy purchasers of material and equipment, thereby keeping in operation immense locomotive and car manufacturing plants, bridge works, rolling mills, furnaces and other industries dependent in large measure upon the railroads as purchasers of their output. In fact, the railroads are regarded as the most important factor of all the forces which have contributed to the upbuilding and industrial progress of the country, and particularly so in the development of the resources of the South. The part which has been taken by the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company in the development of the territory contiguous to its lines, and especially throughout Southwest Virginia and the West Virginia coal fields, is a striking illustration of the impetus given every branch of material progress through the coöperation of the transportation company. The present system of lines is the outgrowth of business policies inaugurated shortly after the acquisition of the road by Philadelphia capitalists, April 4th, 1881, and enlarged upon during the past two decades until the Norfolk &amp; Western is now one of the great trunk lines of the country. Early Railroad Building In 1851 the Norfolk &amp; Petersburg Railroad was chartered and opened for traffic in 1852. This road ran between Norfolk and Petersburg, a distance of about eighty-one miles. Back in 1846, the Southside Railroad Company was chartered, but was not constructed and placed in operation until 1857, when it was opened for traffic between Petersburg and Lynchburg, the distance being one hundred and twenty-one miles. The Virginia &amp; Tennessee Railroad, chartered in March, 1849, and opened in 1857, ran from Lynchburg to Bristol, Tennessee, a distance of two hundred and four miles. Another road was chartered, and partially constructed, in connection with those mentioned, which was known as the Virginia &amp; Kentucky Railroad. This route was to extend from Bristol to Cumberland Gap. On June 17th, 1870, the Legislature of Virginia passed an act entitled, "An Act to authorize the formation of the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad," which was for the purpose of consolidating the Norfolk &amp; Petersburg Railroad Company, the Southside Railroad Company, the Virginia &amp; Tennessee Railroad, and the Virginia &amp; Kentucky Railroad Company, all of which were in separate existence at that time. This consolidation, while meeting with some opposition at the time, was beyond doubt of vast benefit to the territory traversed by the several lines, as it aided History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company materially in traffic arrangements of great value to all interested. Two new company was placed under the management of General William Mahone, and while the management was censured at times for the manner in which the road's affairs were conducted many improvements were made which effected a betterment of its general condition. During April, 1874, by an Act of the Virginia Legislature the stock of the Virginia &amp; Kentucky Railroad, owned by the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, passed from its control. The road was apparently prospering and controlled the branch from Petersburg to City Point and the extension from Glade Spring, in Washington County, to the Salt Works, about nine miles distant. On October 18th, 1874, the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad Company failed to pay its semi-annual interest due upon the mortgaged debt it had created, N. &amp; W. GENERAL OFFICES, ROANOKE, VIRGINIA and on April 18th, 1875, the semi-annual interest was again in default. This second failure to meet the interest payment caused the trustees, under deed of September 9th, 1870, to file their bill in the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Virginia, praying that a receiver be appointed to take an account of all liens and incumbrances, and a sale made of the property, rights and franchises of the road. On the 9th day of May, 1879, the Court ordered a sale of the property, and the question as to who would become the purchaser of the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad became an absorbing topic. The Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company Organized At this time, the Company owned and operated four hundred and twenty-eight miles of railroad, running through a good portion of Eastern Virginia and the very heart of the great Southwest. At Bristol it connected with the East Tennessee, Virginia &amp; Georgia, while at Norfolk it possessed harbor facilities unexcelled on the Atlantic Coast. It was enclosed on both sides by a rich agricultural country, and the mineral resources along its line were unparalleled in any part of the South. The immense deposits of coal and iron tributary to the line of the Norfolk &amp; Western attracted the attention of Northern capitalists, and on February 10th, 1881, the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad, with its road, property and franchises was purchased by Clarence H. Clark and his associates for the sum of $8,605,000.00, subject to liens and incumbrances amounting to $4,898,159.14, including interest calculated to the first day of January, 1881. The sale was duly confirmed by the Court on the fourth day of April, 1881, and in it the purchasers were designated as the "Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company," under which the reorganization was perfected. The purchase money was paid on the third day of May, 1881, and the road, with its property, franchises, rights and privileges, was deeded to the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company by M. F. Pleasants, who was the Commissioner appointed by the court, which deed was duly recorded in the Clerk's Office of the Hustings Court of the City of Norfolk, Virginia. On the same day the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad Company deeded to the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company all its shares of the capital stock of the Norfolk &amp; Petersburg, the Southside and the Virginia &amp; Tennessee Railroad Company; the Virginia &amp; Kentucky Railroad Company's stock having been already disposed of by the Legislature of Virginia in 1874. The Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad was reorganized under the name of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad, with an authorized capital stock of $25,000,000, and a general mortgage indebtedness of $11,000,000. George F. Tyler was elected President of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company, and acted in that capacity until June, 1883, when he was succeeded by Frederick J. Kimball. On the ninth day of May, 1882, the New River Railroad Company of Virginia, the New River Railroad History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company Company of West Virginia, and the East River Railroad of West Virginia, which were chartered to build extensions throughout the coal fields, were consolidated into the Norfolk &amp; Western system. By the terms of FACE OF No. 3 OR POCAHONTAS SEAM OF COAL—N. &amp; W. RY. the consolidation, the preferred stock of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company was exchanged, share for share, for the preferred stock of the New River Railroad Company of Virginia, and the common stock share for share of the same company and for the ordinary stock of the other companies. Under this plan, the Company issued thirty thousand shares of its preferred stock during the year in exchange for a like amount of the New River preferred. The stock of these companies having been wholly owned by the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company, the preferred stock so issued was held in that company's treasury for future use. First Shipment of Coal The New River division was opened to the coal fields May 21st, 1883, and the first shipments of coal were made during the following month of June. When the first car of coal, which was loaded in a Norfolk &amp; Western red gondola, containing about twenty thousand pounds, reached Norfolk, it was switched onto the city street car line, under the direction of President Kimball, decorated with flags, and hauled about the city by six horses, preceded by the Norfolk Band. The coal was afterwards, by order of President Kimball, distributed among some of the poor of Norfolk. Several prominent citizens of Norfolk made speeches from the car, and the local press had long accounts of the arrival of the coal in Norfolk. It came from a mine with a twelve foot outcropping near Pocahontas. While this car of coal was en route to Norfolk, L. F. Brown, chief clerk to Henry Fink, then General Manager, secured a lump weighing about ten pounds and placed it in a filing box for preservation. He guarded it carefully for many years, varnishing it a number of times to prevent disintegration, and eventually gave half of it to President F. J. Kimball, about a year before Mr. Kimball's death. It was placed on the dining room mantel in Mr. Kimball's home on his Radnor farm, near Philadelphia, and a servant put it in the grate fire. The remaining half of this piece of coal was presented to President L. E. Johnson by Mr. Brown as a Christmas gift for the road, and it is now in a glass case in the museum at Richmond, Virginia. Discovery of Coal in 1862 In the fall of 1862, General G. C. Wharton, of Radford, was marching through West Virginia with his brigade, on his way to Fayette by the Raleigh Turnpike. When beyond Princeton, after crossing Bluestone River, the troops stopped to rest for a few moments in ascending the mountains. Two of his officers, Captain Pole French and Captain Pack, were lying under a train wagon, and while conversing with them, General Wharton remarked that there was coal in that vicinity. Captain Pack replied that there was an abundance of coal there, and that in close proximity to where they were resting, openings had been made and coal was being taken out. This point was on the headwaters of Camp Creek, in Mercer County, West Virginia, and this was in all likelihood the first discovery of coal in that region which led to beneficial results. New River Railroad, Mining and Manufacturing Company General Wharton conceived the idea that if the coal regions he had traversed during the war could be opened up and coke made, an iron-making center could be established in Southwest Virginia. New River, which rises in North Carolina, cuts directly through the range of mountains between Radford and West Virginia giving an outlet; and being satisfied that the charcoal furnaces could not long continue in blast for want of fuel, it seemed practical to penetrate the coal regions for the purpose of making coke. With this plan formed, General Wharton, on his election to the Virginia Legislature, introduced a bill COAL AND COKE OPERATION IN POCAHONTAS FIELD—N. &amp; W. RY. and procured a charter on March 7th, 1872, for what was termed "The New River Railroad, Mining and Manufacturing Company. The charter obtained gave the Company the power History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company upon its organization "To construct, maintain and operate a railroad from New River Depot, a point on the line of the Virginia and Tennessee Division of the Atlantic, Mississippi &amp; Ohio Railroad Company, in the county of Pulaski and state of Virginia, to such a point as may be agreed upon at or near the headwaters of Camp Creek, in the county of Mercer and state of West Virginia; and the said New River Railroad, Mining and Manufacturing Company shall have the privilege of constructing, maintaining and operating such branch roads as may be necessary to bring out coal, iron, and other ores from the counties of Mercer, Somers, and Monroe, of West Virginia, and the counties of Giles, Bland, Pulaski, and Montgomery, of the state of Virginia. And the said New River Railroad, Mining and Manufacturing Company shall be further empowered to acquire ownership of land for mining and manufacturing purposes, and shall be entitled to enjoy all the rights and privileges respectively conferred by the laws of the states of Virginia and West Virginia, upon railroad corporations and mining and manufacturing companies, and shall be subject to the restrictions imposed by such laws upon like corporations. "The Capital stock of the said New River Railroad, Mining and Manufacturing Company shall not exceed $2,000,000, to be divided into shares of $100 each, each share subscribed to be entitled to one vote in all meetings of said company; and $100,000 shall be taken as the minimum subscription on which said company may be organized." On June 17th, 1872, a meeting of the incorporators of the road was held in Pearisburg, Virginia, when Dr. John B. Radford was elected President, with Elbert Fowler as Secretary. Committees were appointed to receive subscriptions to the capital stock of the Company, and to secure grants of land, material, and, as far as possible, the right of way along the proposed line through the coal fields. Richard B. Roane, who was at that time living in Southwest Virginia and engaged in the profession of engineering, was selected to acquire options, grants, material, rights of way, and mineral properties for the Company in the counties of Tazewell and Mercer, and at once proceeded to visit the section for that purpose. He negotiated with a number of parties on this trip and laid the foundations for securing grants of the celebrated coal lands on Flat Top and vicinity, which have since proved to be of enormous value. During the session of the Virginia Legislature of 1872-73, the charter of the Company was amended in several respects to meet the wishes of parties desiring to become connected with the Company. In 1875 the line was surveyed, commencing at New River. It was to run to Hinton, with power to build any branch roads that might be necessary to bring out minerals. This branch line had indirect reference to the counties of Wise, Giles, Bland, Buchanan and others, but pointed more directly to the rich coal fields near Abb's Valley, in Tazewell, and the county of Mercer, West Virginia. During 1878 state convicts were placed at work along the line and grading began for the construction of a narrow-gauge railroad, the convict labor having been secured by General Wharton, who succeeded in having an Act passed to that effect. Further leases, grants, and options were secured by the Company from 1875 to 1878, and on May 9th, 1882. the Company known as The New River Railroad, Mining and Manufacturing Company was merged into the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad. Pocahontas and Flat Top Coal Regions The Pocahontas and Flat Top coal regions opened up by the lines of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway are among the best in the United States. The coal is not only of the highest quality but is in practically inexhaustible quantity. Throughout a large portion of Flat Top Mountains the coal is above water level and lies most conveniently for cheap and expeditious mining. The mineral is deposited in layers throughout the mountain and mined by an entrance cut into the solid bank of coal, on the side of the hill. Tipples are erected near the entrance and through them the coal goes into a railroad car, after being screened and the fine coal separated. These coals, geologically, are the lowest members of the coal measures, and are the equivalent of the Quinemont group of the Kanawha region and the Pottsville deposits of Pennsylvania. They are low in sulphur and ash and unusually high in fixed carbon The coal bed presents a working thickness of about eleven feet around Pocahontas and holds its working dimensions until it reaches Flipping Creek, six or seven miles distant, where it divides into two beds, each some four and one-half and five and one-half feet thick. Westward of Pocahontas, along Laurel Creek, the bed carries its thickness fairly well for a distance of eight miles, and shows practically the same section for quite a distance north of the dividing ridge, on the waters of the Elkhorn and the Tug Fork of Sandy. A large area of country is underlaid with this coal, and it has been estimated that it should yield ten thousand tons per acre, while the upper beds should add probably six thousand tons more. Its quality has been tested both in the laboratory and by actual practice, and for steaming and coking it has no superior. No better idea of its quality can be had than from the McCreath and D'Invillier's analysis which was made from fifteen to twenty samples and is as follows: Water Volatile Matter Fixed Carbon Sulphur Ash 1.011 18.812 74.256 .730 5.191 The same report gave the following analysis of coke taken from ovens in the coking region: Water .182 .196 .664 Volatile Matter .719 .494 1.059 Fixed Carbon 92.248 92.585 92.816 Sulphur .565 .677 .548 Ash 6.286 6.048 4.913 100.000 100.000 100.000 Since the discovery of this valuable field many coal operations have begun and the whole region of country has developed in an amazing degree. Thousands of men are employed and many new towns have sprung up along the lines of the Norfolk &amp; Western. Millions of dollars are invested in plants, machinery and equipment for mining coal and for ovens for making coke. The shipment of coal and coke has become a business of first importance and the Norfolk &amp; Western is now the greatest coal carrying road in the South. History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company Cripple Creek Extension and Norfolk Terminal When the New River Division was opened to the coal fields and the first shipments were made in June, 1883, the abundance of coke which would naturally be produced led to the abolishment of charcoal furnaces in the Cripple Creek region and coke furnaces were built in their stead. To form a connection between the coking fields of the Flat Top regions and the ore belt about Cripple Creek was the next step taken by the Norfolk &amp; Western. An improvement and extension mortgage for $5,000,000 was created, with power under certain restrictions to increase the sum to $8,000,000 for the purpose of double tracking. BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF ROANOKE SHOPS—N. &amp; W. RY. Proposals having been made for these bonds, which were satisfactory, the proceeds were to be used as follows: First—The construction of the Cripple Creek Extension of the New River Division, about fifty miles in length. This work was put under contract December 10th, 1883, to be completed during the year 1884. Second—For increased terminal facilities at Norfolk. Contracts were entered into for this work December 28th, 1883, the work to be completed prior to August 31st, 1884. Third—To build short lines to new coal fields. Fourth—For additional sidings, stations and other improvements on the main line. The building of the Cripple Creek extension opened up a mineral region containing rich deposits of iron ore, lead, and zinc; probably the finest mineral deposits in the Southwest. It was originally contemplated that an extension would be made from Ivanhoe on to North Carolina, but the building of the Roanoke &amp; Southern line from Roanoke to Winston-Salem, which was begun in 1887, gave an outlet into North Carolina and the original idea of building from Ivanhoe was abandoned. The improvement of the property of the Norfolk Terminal Company is so intimately blended with the opening of the coal mines, that although not situated in Southwest Virginia, they have a direct bearing on the development of the mineral resources of that section. To meet the growing demands for increased terminal facilities, the Norfolk Terminal Company was chartered in 1882, through an Act of the Virginia Legislature, and several valuable wharf properties below the city of Norfolk near Lamberts Point were purchased, the tract embracing about four hundred and thirty-eight acres, with one and one-half miles of water-front. Improvements of all kinds were made for the storage and handling of grain, cotton, tobacco and other products, while piers were erected for coaling vessels and ocean steamers. So rapid were the improvements made on this property that in 1884 a railroad had been constructed from Norfolk to Lambert's Point, a distance of 5.3 miles, together with yard room and sidings necessary for the accommodation of the Norfolk &amp; Western's tidewater coal traffic. A pier eight hundred and ninety-four feet in length, and sixty feet wide was built, which terminated at the United States Lighthouse—known as "Lambert's Point Light." This pier was divided into upper and lower stories, from each of which vessels could be loaded, there being forty-five bins, each having a capacity of one hundred and fifty tons. The pier was equipped with modern appliances for loading, unloading and handling cars, three thousand five hundred tons per diem being the capacity of receipts and discharges, while the depth of the water in the approach to the main channel was twenty-five feet at low tide. In 1885 from March 12th to December 31st, four hundred and two vessels of all kinds were loaded at the pier, among which were forty-five ocean steamers. In 1886, there were loaded six hundred and seventy-six vessels of all kinds, among which were ninety-five ocean steamers, while the storage houses erected for grain, cotton, tobacco and other products for foregin shipment did an extensive business. During 1884 and 1885 the extension into the Bluestone country was completed and this line opened up History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company another region containing coal of magnificent quality and in large quantity, giving an outlet for the mines located on the Bluestone River. The penetration of this country by a branch of the Norfolk &amp; Western caused a transformation of this part of Virginia and West Virginia, changing a barren wilderness into a thriving, productive portion of the State. During 1887 the extension from Mill Creek to Elkhorn was completed, notwithstanding such obstacles as tunnels, huge trestles, bridging mountain gorges, and other difficulties retarding construction. This extension opened up the rich coal deposits in McDowell County and gave employment to thousands of miners. In January, 1888, there were two thousand and thirty coke ovens completed or in course of construction in this field. Clinch Valley Extension Prior to 1886, a charter had been obtained for the construction of a railroad called "The Clinch Valley Railroad," and at the annual meeting of the stockholders in 1886, a resolution was passed empowering the directors of the Norfolk &amp; Western to make a consolidation of this Clinch Valley extension with their company. By the terms of the charter, this company was given authority to locate and construct a road "Commencing in Tazewell County, at a point at or near the New River division of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company, and running thence to such a point on or near the Clinch River, Powell River, or either, or any branch thereof, in Russell, Wise, Scott or Lee counties, and by such route as might be deemed most suitable to the directors of the said company." On March 8th and May 2d, 1887, the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company and the Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Company entered into contracts by which both agreed to construct and finish (each one respectively from its lines) this extension to a point in Wise County, Virginia, both connecting there. Work upon this extension by the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company was begun June 20th, 1887, and runs from Graham on the New River Division to Norton, at which latter point it connects with the Louisville &amp; Nashville. On leaving Tazewell, it touches the very borders of the celebrated Clinch Valley coal region, where is mined a coal excellent for gaseous and domestic purposes. When the road reaches Wise County it penetrates the very heart of the coal country stretching from this part of the county to Big Stone Gap. It also opened up a vast domain covered with timber and gave an outlet for live stock and agricultural products, the section being one of the richest and most productive in the entire Southwest. One-Hundred-Year Mortgage With the object of perfecting northwestern and southeastern connections, and for other purposes deemed advisable by the Company, the Norfolk &amp; Western on the twenty-ninth day of October, 1889, created what is known as the one-hundred-year mortgage, which is a first lien upon the property when all underlying liens are refunded. This mortgage provides an issue of $10,000,000, five per cent. bonds, of which $6,000,000 was for the purpose of constructing the Ohio Extension, $1,500,000 for building the North Carolina Extension and the remainder for redeeming the Norfolk Terminal Company's first mortgage, and retiring the convertible debenture loan of the Railroad Company. The Ohio Extension follows the waters of the Big Sandy River from Elkhorn, in McDowell County, for about ninety-five miles, thence about fifteen miles over a low summit to the headwaters of Twelve Pole Creek, which it follows for about seventy-one miles and crosses the Ohio River by a steel bridge and runs about fourteen miles to Ironton, Ohio, making a total distance of one hundred and ninety-five miles. Shenandoah Valley Railroad Purchased On December 15th, 1890, an adjourned meeting of the stockholders of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company was held in the city of Roanoke, at which meeting a report was submitted with reference to the purchase of the railroad, property and franchises of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad, under a plan and agreement dated August 5th, 1890, for the reorganization of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad, with the form of proposed deed of conveyance by the Shenandoah Valley Railroad to the Norfolk &amp; Western. The report was adopted, and the meeting confirmed and ratified the action of the board of directors of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad in becoming a party to the plan and agreement dated August 5th, 1890, under authority vested in them by the annual meeting of the stockholders held May 7th, 1890; and on resolution the Norfolk &amp; Western became the purchasers of the railroad, property, and franchises of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad Company, and the president of the Norfolk &amp; Western was authorized on behalf of the Company to accept the deed of conveyance, and to do and cause to be done whatever might be necessary to perfect the purchase. The same meeting authorized the board of directors to create an issue of bonds of the Company amounting to $10,000,000, to be known as the "Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company, Maryland and Washington Division, First Mortgage, Five Per Cent. Gold Bonds," and to secure the same by deed of trust or mortgage upon all the railroad property, and franchises to be acquired by the Norfolk &amp; Western, under the deed of conveyance from the Shenandoah Valley Railroad Company, and open any extension of said railroad to Washington, D. C., including any terminals in the District of Columbia; and extensions, short branches, and improvements thereafter acquired with the proceeds of any of said bonds, on such terms and in such manner as the board of directors might deem best. The meeting further approved the action of the board of directors in creating forty-five thousand shares of preferred stock and twenty-five thousand shares of common stock of the Company for the purpose of carrying out the plan and agreement for the reorganization of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad; and the board was further authorized and declared to be vested with full authority to do or cause to be done whatever might be necessary or advisable to complete the purchase, to create the bonds, to issue the said shares of preferred and common stock, and to extend the line of the Company to the city of Washington, and otherwise carry the plan and agreement into full effect. The board of directors was further authorized by the meeting to proceed to construct, whenever in its judgment might be deemed prudent and advisable, History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company an extension from any point on the line acquired from the Shenandoah Valley Railroad to a point on the Potomac River, near Washington, D. C., and to also proceed to construct or otherwise acquire a line of railroad into Washington, D. C., from a point at or near the Potomac River opposite Washington, and to acquire terminals in the city of Washington. At the same meeting a resolution was adopted by which the Company agreed to consolidation and merger of the capital stock, property, franchises, and privileges of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad Company with and into the capital stock, property, franchises and privileges of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company, on terms and conditions substantially the same as those set forth in the articles of consolidation and merger submitted, whenever such consolidation and merger might appear advisable to the board of directors; authority being vested in the proper officers under the resolution, to perfect the merger and consolidation. ONE OF THE MODERN TYPES OF ENGINES NOW USED ON THE NORFOLK &amp; WESTERN—(Mallet) Scioto Valley Railroad Purchased There was also submitted to this meeting a copy of a circular issued to the shareholders with reference to the purchase of the Scioto Valley &amp; New England Railroad, and a form of deed of conveyance under which the property of the Scioto Valley &amp; New England Railroad had been conveyed to the Norfolk &amp; Western. On resolution, the action of the board in purchasing the property and accepting the deed for the same, dated July 22d, 1890, was approved, ratified and confirmed. The board of directors was further authorized by this meeting to create an issue of bonds of the Norfolk &amp; Western to an amount not exceeding $5,000,000, for the purpose of acquiring from time to time additional railroad equipment and rolling stock for the use of the Company; such bonds to be secured by deed of trust or mortgage upon such additional railroad equipment and rolling stock, in such manner and on such terms as to the board might seem best. The Scioto Valley &amp; New England Railroad, extending from Ironton, on the Ohio River, to Columbus, Ohio, a distance of 128.6 miles, with 28.7 miles of sidings was acquired and incorporated into the accounts of the Norfolk &amp; Western as of February 1st, 1890, and was operated as the Scioto Valley Division. The Shenandoah Valley Railroad, extending from Roanoke, Virginia, to Hagerstown, Maryland, a distance of 238.11 miles, with 17.44 miles of branches and 33.01 miles of sidings, was acquired as of date October 1st, 1890. During 1890 there were constructed and put into operation 15.7 miles of short branches to coal and iron mines, 45.64 miles of siding and 31.4 miles of second or double track. Double Tracking Begun The double-tracking was begun during April, 1890, and as undertaken extended from Roanoke to Big Spring, 20 miles; from Christiansburg to Radford, 13 miles; and from Bluefield to Bluestone Junction, 12 miles, a total of 45 miles, of which 31.4 miles, although not fully ballasted, was in use at the close of the year, and it was expected the remaining 13.6 miles would be ready for use by April 1st, 1891. The acquisition of the Scioto Valley &amp; New England Railroad afforded a direct line to Columbus, on completion of the Ohio extension, and the acquisition of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad secured close and direct relations with the manufacturing districts of Pennsylvania and Maryland, and with the New England States. On January 1st, 1891, in conformity with the organization then in effect, the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad was operated with two grand divisions; the Eastern General Division extending from Roanoke to Lambert's Point, including Roanoke Yard and branch lines, and the Western General Division comprising all lines west of Roanoke. Lynchburg &amp; Durham and Roanoke &amp; Southern Lines Operated On March 1st, 1892, the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad assumed the operation of the Lynchburg &amp; Durham Railroad Company, under the terms of an agreement entered into January 15th, 1892, between the Penn Construction Company, the Lynchburg &amp; Durham Railroad Company, and the Norfolk &amp; Western, with the privilege of a permanent lease, or purchase after March 1st, 1893, of the bonds and a majority of the capital stock of the Lynchburg &amp; Durham Railroad. Under the terms of a lease dated March 16th, 1892, the Roanoke &amp; Southern Railway Company was operated by the Norfolk &amp; Western; the latter company guaranteeing payment of the principal and interest of the mortgage bonds of the line leased. The board of directors of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad was authorized by resolutions adopted by the meeting of the stockholders held May 4th, 1892, to effect a merger and consolidation of both the Lynchburg &amp; Durham and the Roanoke &amp; Southern with the History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad; and to aid the Columbus Connecting &amp; Terminal Company in the construction of its road by subscriptions to its capital stock, or such other ways as the board might consider proper, with the further authorization of purchase of the line, should the board deem advisable. During 1892 the branch line 1.33 miles in length, connecting the Lynchburg &amp; Durham with the Norfolk &amp; Western was completed, and put into operation October 22d, of that year. There were also built 3.87 miles of second track between Norfolk and Lambert's Point, and also a merchandise pier at the latter point, with a two-story warehouse 705 feet long and 140 feet wide, equipped with all modern appliances for the economical handling of freight; and an eighteen-stall engine house and repair shops. Besides this addition at Lambert's Point, twenty-five stalls were added to the roundhouse at Bluefield. The Ohio Extension, work upon which was commenced in March, 1890, was so far completed November 1st, 1892, as to permit of opening the line for traffic upon that date, although the ballasting, station buildings and some minor details of construction work were not fully completed. At the meeting of the stockholders held May 3d, 1893, the board of directors was authorized by appropriate resolutions to prosecute the work of building the "Dingess Branch" from a point on the Ohio Extension near the confluence of the Dingess Trace and Twelve Pole River, and extending up Twelve Pole River; also the extension of North Fork of Elkhorn Branch from the end of the location of the North Fork of the Elkhorn Branch and extending up the North Fork of Elkhorn. The meeting also approved the action of the board of directors in contracting under date of January 5th, 1893, for a lease of the Lynchburg &amp; Durham Railroad for the term of nine hundred and ninety-nine years from March 1st, 1893; and a further agreement under the terms of the lease to guarantee the principal and interest of $2,012,000, first mortgage bonds of the Lynchburg &amp; Durham Railroad Company. Of this issue of bonds, $462,000 to become the property of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company together with eleven thousand six hundred and thirty shares of capital stock, out of a total issue of eighteen thousand seven hundred and sixty-three shares. Columbus Terminals In 1893 the terminals at Columbus, Ohio, were completed and put into operation July 1st, contracts being made for their use jointly by the Norfolk &amp; Western, the Columbus, Sandusky &amp; Hocking, and the Cleveland, Akron &amp; Columbus Railroad companies. Short spurs or branches to mining operations, and to the Mathieson Alkali Works at Saltville, Va., were built, along with 20.59 miles of sidings on the Ohio Extension and 6.43 miles of sidings on leased lines. At the meeting of the shareholders held May 2d, 1894, the board of directors was given authority to arrange for the construction of numerous branch lines, such as North Fork of Elkhorn Branch, Buzzard's Creek Branch, Dan's Branch, branches of leases numbers one, three and four, Norfolk Coal and Coke Company, Leftwich Branch, Bear Wallow Branch, and others, to accommodate the growing development of coal properties. Purchase of Roanoke Machine Works and Virginia Company The meeting further authorized the board to effect a consolidation and merger of the Roanoke Machine Works and the Virginia Company, and their respective capital stocks, properties and franchises, with and into the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company; or to purchase the same if considered advisable by the board; the terms and conditions to be such as the board might consider for the best interests of the Company. In 1894 the union station at Kenova was completed, also 4.53 miles of sidings, but very little new work of improvement or construction was undertaken. Five hundred new freight cars, equipped with air brakes and automatic couplers were purchased to replace cars destroyed, and a revaluation was made of the old equipment of small carrying capacity and obsolete pattern acquired at the time of the organization of the Company in 1881. Such of this equipment as was worn out and retired was charged off from rolling stock account to surplus income account. In the fourteenth annual report of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company, for the year ending December 31st, 1894, it is stated that the entire capital stock of the Roanoke Machine Works, and $417,400 of its issue of $500,000 First Mortgage Bonds, belonged to the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad, the cost of the plant being $1,069,894.97. Further, that the Virginia Company which was organized in 1882 with a capital of $50,000, and afterwards increased to $100,000, was owned by the Norfolk &amp; Western. The Virginia Company, at the close of 1894 owned real estate costing $490,457, subject to an outstanding mortgage of $130,000, the difference between the capitalization and the amount invested having been advanced by the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company. The Virginia Company was organized to acquire property needed for railroad purposes at division points where it was impossible to secure the exact acreage required, and more land was purchased than was needed by the railroad company. In such cases title was vested in the Virginia Company, with the view of making sales from time to time of such of the property as was not required for railroad purposes. The report states that in addition to the ownership of the two companies mentioned, the Norfolk &amp; Western owned the capital stock of the Pocahontas Coal Company, which was organized in 1885 at the request of the coal mining companies at that time producing coal in the Pocahontas field, for the purpose of enabling it to act as agent for the sale of coal, as through the employment of a single selling agent more regular and equitable prices to consumers could be made, thereby encouraging the establishment of industrial enterprises; while preventing unnecessary competition it would benefit the producers, and at the same time, by simplifying the distribution of cars, it would enable the Railroad Company to distribute the coal with greater economy than would otherwise be the case. The capital, originally $5,000, had been increased from time to time as required by the growth of business, until it was $200,000 in 1894, of which $199,500 belonged to the Norfolk &amp; Western. The Pocahontas Coal Company at that time controlled through leases in New York Harbor three History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company wharves with machinery for discharging vessels, and owned a number of small lighters and other property needed in its business. The Receivership Owing to the continued business depression throughout the year 1893, the net earnings of the Railroad FIRST LOCOMOTIVE RUN ON NORFOLK &amp; WESTERN (Wood Burner) Company were insufficient to meet the fixed interest charges and rentals, and at the close of that year there was a small floating debt. During 1894 the transportation of freight increased seven hundred and twelve thousand three hundred and ninety-two tons, or eleven per cent., compared with the gross freight carried in 1893, but while the gross earnings increased $307,835 over 1893, the prevalent low rates and the large proportion of low class freight increased the percentage of cost, and notwithstanding the economies effected, the operating expenses were $494,445 greater, and the net earnings $186,610 less than in 1893. The net income in 1894 was again insufficient to meet interest charges and rentals, and the deficiency for the year, including losses in operating leased lines and sinking fund was $618,392. As the Company had to borrow money to meet maturity payments on car trusts and other capital accounts, at the close of the year 1894 the outstanding bills payable, including those of the Roanoke Machine Works, (the entire stock and bonds of which corporation were owned by the railroad company), amounted to $1,000,624.61. As the sinking fund of the equipment mortgage loan of 1888 amounted to $150,000 annually, in addition to payments on account of principal of car trusts for the next eight years, aggregating $3,500,000; and as the interest charges, rentals, and car trusts payments due in 1895 amounted to about $1,000,000 more than the net earnings of 1894, the Company's inability to meet its obligations impaired its credit and the market price of its securities to the extent that the management was unable to make necessary financial provisions for carrying on the business of the Company. Under these circumstances, the Finance Committee sought the advice of those who, by reason of large interests in the securities of the Company and their knowledge of its resources, as well as by their financial experience and judgment, were best qualified to recommend what course would, under the circumstances, be to the best interest of the Company and its security holders. On January 29th, 1895, a meeting of the Finance Committee was held, at which time detailed information was submitted as to the financial condition of the Company; and after full consideration it was resolved that a committee composed of Messrs. John Crosby Brown, J. Kennedy Todd, A. A. H. Boissevain, C. Sligo de Porthonier, and George Coppell be requested to examine into the financial affairs of the Company and make such recommendations as they might deem advisable in the interest of the Company and its security holders. Statements and reports relative to the Company's financial position were transmitted to this committee, which made a report under date of February 4th, 1895, in which they stated that it was their belief that a reorganization of the Company's finances could be affected within a short time; but that it was obviously impracticable to dispose of further issues of its bonds or stocks at satisfactory prices, owing to the present state of the Company's credit. The committee further recommended that such action be taken by the board of directors as would in their judgment protect the interests of all concerned. The board of directors, having these communications before them, and having notice of an intention on the part of a trustee under several of its principal mortgages to file a bill for the appointment of a receiver, determined that the interests of all concerned would be promoted by the appointment of a receiver, to take charge and control of the property and manage the same until some arrangements could be made with the creditors of the Company and its financial embarrassments removed. The counsel for the Company was accordingly authorized to make answer on behalf of the Company. A bill having been filed February 6th, 1895, in the United States Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, and bills auxiliary thereto, Messrs. Frederick J. Kimball and Henry Fink were confirmed as receivers of the railroad and property of the Company in Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland and Pennsylvania; and Henry Fink as receiver in Ohio. During 1895 the traffic and revenue of the road were seriously affected by a strike of the miners in the Pocahontas field which began May 1st, and continued for a period of five months. Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company The Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company was organized on the 24th day of September, 1896, under the laws of the state of Virginia and an Act of the Assembly approved January 15th, 1896, entitled "An Act authorizing the purchasers of the railroads and property of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company, sold by foreclosure of a deed of trust or mortgage thereon, to become a corporation, to adopt a name therefor and to possess and exercise general and other powers." The Company was formed pursuant to the plan of reorganization of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company, dated March 12th, 1896, by the purchasers at foreclosure sale of the railroads, branches, rights, privileges, franchises and properties of the said company, sold under foreclosure of its One-Hundred-Year Mortgage, dated October 29th, 1889. Mr. Henry Fink was elected President of the Company, and Mr. Frederick J. Kimball was made Chairman of the Board of Directors. On October 1st, 1896, the Company obtained from History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company the receivers of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company possession, and assumed operation of the following properties: 1. The main line from Norfolk, Virginia, to the State line at Bristol, with branches aggregating about four hundred and forty-one miles. 2. The Norfolk Terminal Division, including the railroads from Norfolk to Lambert's Point, the coal piers, docks and warehouses and about four hundred and fifteen acres of land at Lambert's Point—five miles. 3. The New River Division, from Radford, Virginia, to Kyle, West Virginia, and the Cripple Creek Division, with branches aggregating about one hundred and fifty-three miles. 4. The North Carolina Extension from Ivanhoe, Virginia, to the State line of Virginia and North Carolina, completed, however, to Gossan, with branches aggregating about eighteen miles. 5. The Clinch Valley Division, from Graham, Virginia, to Norton, with branches, aggregating about one hundred and sixteen miles. 6. The Ohio Extension, from Kyle, West Virginia, to Coal Grove, formerly Petersburg, Ohio, with branches, aggregating about two hundred and seven miles. 7. The Maryland and Washington Division, formerly the Shenandoah Valley Railroad, from Roanoke, Virginia, to Hagerstown, Maryland, with branches, aggregating about two hundred and fifty-seven miles. 8. The Lynchburg and Durham Division, formerly the Lynchburg &amp; Durham Railroad, from Lynchburg to Durham, North Carolina, about one hundred and fourteen miles. On December 1st, 1896, the Company obtained possession, and assumed operation of the: 9. Scioto Valley Division of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad and New England Railroad from Coal Grove, Ohio, to the city of Columbus, together with the leasehold interest in the Union Depot, Columbus, and the Columbus Terminals, the property of the Columbus Connecting &amp; Terminal Railroad Company at Columbus, Ohio, one hundred and thirty-five miles. 10. Roanoke and Southern Division, formerly the Roanoke &amp; Southern Railway, from Roanoke to Winston, North Carolina, aggregating one hundred and twenty-three miles. The Company having acquired all the bonds, capital stock and obligations of the Roanoke Machine Works, and the same having been canceled, the property and franchises of the Roanoke Machine Works were by deed dated January 18th, 1897, conveyed to the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company. The Railway Company owns and holds title to all the foregoing properties by direct ownership. The Company also acquired with the foregoing properties and at sequestration sales one thousand eight hundred and seventy-six shares of the capital stock of the Old Dominion Steamship Company, par value $100 each; one thousand nine hundred and ninety-five shares of the capital stock of the Pocahontas Coal Company, par value $30 each; one thousand shares of the capital stock of the Virginia Company, par value $100 each, together with claims of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company and the receivers against the Virginia Company for loans and advances amounting to $300,822.58. Six thousand shares of the Columbus Connecting &amp; Terminal Railroad Company, par value $100 each, sixty-five per cent. paid; and sundry miscellaneous securities. By plans of organization the total authorized amount of stock of the Company was fixed at $89,000,000, consisting of two classes: Common Stock—660,000 Shares $66,000,000. Adjustment Preferred Stock—230,000 Shares $23,000,000. The railroad and property embracing the main line from Norfolk to Bristol, and the New River Divisions were purchased subject to the following lines: Bonds and obligations secured by Divisional Liens prior to General Mortgage of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company, dated May 4th, 1881 $3,505,200. Bonds of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company, issued under its General Mortgage dated May 4th, 1881, executed to the Fidelity Insurance Trust and Safe Deposit Company, Trustee, amounting to $7,283,000. Bonds of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company, issued under its New River Division First Mortgage, dated May 12th, 1882, executed to the Fidelity Insurance, Trust and Safe Deposit Company, amounting to $2,000,000. Bonds of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company, issued under its improvement and extension mortgage, dated December 21st, 1883, executed to the Fidelity Insurance, Trust and Safe Deposit Company, amounting to $5,000,000. The Scioto Valley Division and the property of the Columbus Connecting &amp; Terminal Railroad Company were purchased subject to the following liens: Bonds of the Scioto Valley &amp; New England Railway Company, issued under its First Mortgage, dated November 1st, 1889, executed to the Central Trust Company of New York, Trustee, amounting to $5,000,000. Bonds of the Columbus Connecting &amp; Terminal Railroad Company, issued under its First Mortgage, dated May 4th, 1892, executed to the Atlantic Trust Company, Trustee, amounting to $600,000. Making the total amount of prior liens $23,388,200. In pursuance of the plan of organization, the Company executed its First Consolidated Mortgage, dated October 22d, 1896, to the Mercantile Trust Company as Trustee, providing for the total issue of $62,500,000, First Consolidated Four Per Cent. Gold Bonds, dated October 22d, 1896, and maturing October 22d, 1996, to be issued as follows: $23,322,600 issued to the Purchasers, in consideration of the transfer of the property. $25,986,889 reserved to take up the above mentioned undisturbed prior obligations. $3,500,000 reserved for the purchase or payment of Car Trust obligations and other charges; for the creation of a reserve fund for special improvements and for any other necessary purposes of the Railway Company. $9,690,511 reserved, under carefully guarded restrictions for new construction and acquisitions, and for betterments and improvements, such bonds to be issued at a rate not exceeding $1,000,000 per annum. The mortgage authorized the issue, in place of the History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company above $3,500,000 First Consolidated Bonds, of a like amount of Fifty-Year Prior Gold Bonds, if it should be found advantageous so to do. The First Consolidated Mortgage is a first lien on the Norfolk Terminal Division, the Clinch Valley Division, the Lynchburg and Durham Division, the Roanoke and Southern Division, the Maryland and Washington Division, the Ohio Extension and the North Carolina Extension, aggregating about eight hundred and forty miles. It is also a first lien on the Roanoke Machine Shops. In accordance with the provisions of the plan of reorganization, the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company delivered to the purchasers: $23,322,500 First Consolidated Mortgage Bonds. $23,000,000 Adjustment Preferred Stock. $66,000,000 Common Stock. Of which there were returned to the treasury of the Railway Company: $467,850 First Consolidated Mortgage Bonds. $308,939 Adjustment Preferred Stock. $1,620,612.50 Common Stock. The $100,000 Consolidated Mortgage, Third Preferred Six Per Cent. Bonds of the Southside Railroad Company, which matured January 1st, 1897, were extended to July 1st, 1900, at five per cent. interest per annum. During January, 1896, the Company's general office building at Roanoke was destroyed by fire, and on September 29th, 1896, a hurricane and rainstorm of great severity occurred in the section of country traversed by the Maryland and Washington Division, washing out several miles of track and destroying embankments, bridges, culverts, and trestles. The operation of the division was suspended for about a week, until temporary repairs could be completed. During the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1898, six new heavy consolidated engines were purchased for use as pushers on the Flat Top Mountain Grade; also one thousand box cars, five hundred and fifty gondola cars, fifty stock cars, fifteen poultry cars and ten cabin cars. At the close of June, 1898, the road's equipment consisted of sixty-five passenger engines, three hundred and twenty-five freight engines, twenty-six switching engines, one hundred and forty-six passenger cars, thirty-four baggage and express cars, twenty-five baggage and mail cars, nine mail cars, nineteen combination passenger and baggage cars, five officers' cars, one pay car, and seventeen thousand three hundred and eighty-three freight cars of all descriptions. A total of four hundred and sixteen engines, two hundred and thirty-nine passenger cars and seventeen thousand three hundred and eighty-three freight cars, with four hundred and thirty-seven cars for maintenance of way equipment, two sea-going tugs and ten barges. During the year the roadway and structures were much improved and nearly one hundred miles of main and second track were relaid with eighty-five-pound steel rails, and over forty-two miles with seventy-five-pound steel rails. There were also built over twenty miles of new sidings. In March, 1898, a flood in the Scioto River caused considerable damage to the roadway and track of the Scioto Valley Division, and trains over that Division had to be suspended for several days. During the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1899, the Trustees of the First Consolidated Mortgage delivered to the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company $1,500, 000 par value of the bonds reserved under the terms of the mortgage, and the same were sold and the proceeds applied to reimburse the Company for expenditures made on account of construction, equipment and betterments. Also $500,000 par value of the First Consolidated Mortgage Bonds reserved under the terms of the mortgage, which latter bonds were placed in the Company's treasury, but set apart from other assets and bonds of the Company to be used only for the purposes authorized by the terms of the mortgage. During this fiscal year, the work of grading the new low-grade branch of 7.2 miles near Radford was begun, the construction of this branch shortening the line 4.3 miles and reducing the grade from seventy-eight feet per mile eastbound and eighty-six feet per mile westbound, to eleven feet per mile eastbound, and the maximum curvature from fourteen degrees to six degrees. During the year 25.65 miles of main track was relaid with eighty-five-pound steel rails, and 55.86 miles with new seventy-five-pound steel rails. During the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1900, Divisional Lien Bonds amounting to $3,488,300, at from four to eight per cent. per annum, which matured during the year, were refunded into the Company's First Consolidated Mortgage Four Per Cent. Bonds, resulting in an annual saving of over $50,000 from July 1st, 1900. Good progress was made during the year on the low grade branch near Radford which was expected to be ready for operation by October, 1900. During the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1901, $2,000,000 par value of the Company's First Consolidated Mortgage Bonds were sold and the proceeds applied to reimburse the Company for expenditures made on account of construction, equipment and betterments, and its terminal facilities at Cincinnati. During this fiscal year, the Company acquired by purchase the Cincinnati, Portsmouth &amp; Virginia Railroad Company, consisting of five thousand nine hundred and forty shares, par value at $100 per share, of preferred stock, and fifteen thousand six hundred and sixty shares of common stock, par value $100 per share, except the shares necessary to qualify the directors of that Company. The Company also acquired $75,000 Hillsboro Division Purchase Money Four Per Cent. Gold Bonds. The bonded debt of the Cincinnati, Portsmouth &amp; Virginia Railroad Company amounting to $400,000 as well as the $200,000 First Mortgage Bonds of the Cincinnati Connecting Belt Company were called for redemption and paid July 1st, 1901, the funds in both instances being loaned by the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway to pay the bonds mentioned. The Company also purchased during the year two hundred and twenty-four additional shares, par value $22,400 of the stock of the Old Dominion Steamship Company. There was also built at Lambert's Point a new steel coal pier for the expeditious transfer of coal to large ocean steamers, and there was also expended the sum of $665,000 for betterments, principally for the replacement of wooden bridges and trestles by permanent structures, and strengthening old light iron bridges, and in the reduction of grades. The Cincinnati, Portsmouth &amp; Virginia Railroad acquired History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Compny extends from Sciotoville, Ohio, where it connects with the Norfolk &amp; Western, to Idlewild, Cincinnati, a distance of one hundred and eight miles. At Idlewild it connects with the Cincinnati, Lebanon &amp; Northern Railroad and uses that line under a trackage arrangement for 3.6 miles into Cincinnati. Between Sciotoville and Portsmouth, 5.3 miles, the line parallels the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway, forming with it a double track. It also owns the Columbus &amp; Maysville Railroad, known as the Hillsboro Branch, from Sardinia to Hillsboro, 18.6 miles. This branch at the time of acquisition of the Cincinnati, Portsmouth &amp; Virginia Railroad by the Norfolk &amp; Western, was leased to and operated by the Hillsboro Railroad Company for a term of ten years from March 1st, 1900. The Cincinnati, Portsmouth &amp; Virginia Railroad was also the owner of the Cincinnati Connecting Belt Line from Idlewild to Ivorydale, 4.57 miles. By means of this line, it has access to important industrial establishments and makes connections with the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Southwestern Railroad, the Cincinnati, Hamilton &amp; Dayton Railroad and the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St. Louis Railroad. On October 11th, 1900, the New River connecting branch was opened for traffic and the Company accepted an Act of the General Assembly of Virginia approved February 15th, 1901, authorizing the abandonment of the old high-grade line between New River Depot and Back Creek in Pulaski County. The Cripple Creek Extension from Ivanhoe to Speedwell Furnace was authorized by the Board and 10.5 miles placed under contract for building, four miles of which were completed at the end of the fiscal year. The Cran Creek Coal Branch which leaves the main line at Duhring and extends for 5.5 miles was authorized by the Board to be built, as well as the Laurel Creek Branch of about two miles in Tazewell County, also the Briar Mountain Branch, extending about four miles from near the entrance of Alum Creek into Tug River, and the Bluestone Low-Grade Line which leaves the main line a short distance east of the eastern portal of the Flat Top Tunnel, length 2.1 miles. The Bluestone Low-Grade Line saves 0.8 mile in distance, and reduces the grade from 2.23 per cent. on the main line to 1.1 per cent., and saves over five hundred degrees of curvature. At the close of the year, about one-half of the grading had been done, including the heading of a tunnel seven hundred feet long. The Board also authorized surveys to be made for an extension of the North Carolina Branch up New River to the magnetic ore deposits at its head waters in Ashe County, North Carolina. The Company also accepted an Act of the General Assembly of North Carolina, ratified February 18th, 1901, authorizing the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company to locate, construct and operate extensions and branches of its line within the state of North Carolina. On the 21st and 22d of October, 1900, a continuous rainfall caused heavy slides on the Norfolk, Radford, and Pocahontas Divisions, and the washing out of trestles and trestle-bents on the Shenandoah Division and on the North Carolina Branch. Damage by Floods in 1901 On the 20th and 21st of April, 1901, a heavy rain, continuing for forty-eight hours, caused considerable damage to the roadway, tracks, trestle, and telegraph lines on the Radford, Pocahontas, and Scioto divisions. The New River rose to a great height, overflowing its banks and the track near Radford, and washing out the Hematite Ore Branch Bridge at Foster Falls. A heavy slide or cave-in in Eggleston Tunnel on the Radford Division interrupted the traffic on that part of the road for several days. On May 21st and 22d, a very heavy rainstorm prevailed on the Norfolk, Shenandoah, Radford, Pocahontas, and Scioto Valley divisions, causing considerable damage to the track, bridges and trestles. A most disastrous flood occurred June 21st and 22d, on the Pocahontas Division, in the Pocahontas coal fields. Owing to the great flood-wave, caused by a cloud-burst, and the rapidity of its approach, people at some places were unable to escape from their houses in the low grounds and many were drowned. The number of persons who perished could not be correctly ascertained but was estimated at from twenty-five to forty. The district affected by this flood extended over a distance of about sixty-five miles. The greatest damage was caused west of the Flat Top Mountain on the Elkhorn River. Nearly the entire North Fork Coal Branch, nine miles long, was washed away. The main line between 381 mile post and 392 mile post was washed away entirely in numerous places, or damaged, the washouts varying from one hundred feet to twelve hundred feet in length. At the town of Keystone, the embankment fifteen feet high was entirely washed out for a distance of one thousa feet. Four iron bridges, together with a part of the masonry upon which the superstructure rested, were washed out between North Fork Junction and Davy Station. The telegraph line was practically destroyed for many miles in the flooded district, causing serious delay in the movement of traffic after the line was opened. Some of the freight cars standing on the sidings in the coal fields were swept down stream; others were turned over and covered with debris, but no serious loss or damage resulted from their displacement. The roadway in the Clinch Valley was also damaged and the track obstructed by slides in many places. The transportation department made strenuous efforts to effect temporary repairs within the shortest time practicable, and notwithstanding the unfavorable conditions of the weather, (a second heavy rainstorm on June 26th having washed away a portion of the temporary repair work), succeeded in opening the line on the twenty-ninth of June. Many of the coal operators in the Pocahontas Field, and some of their employees, also suffered severe losses from the flood. The operators repaired their plants very promptly, and in many cases were able to resume shipments as soon as the road was opened for traffic. The board of directors appropriated the sum of $250, 000 to be expended in restoring the property destroyed and damaged by the flood. Cincinnati, Portsmouth &amp; Virginia Railroad Acquired During the fiscal year, ending June 30th, 1902, the Cincinnati, Portsmouth &amp; Virginia Railroad, the Cincinnati Connecting Belt Railroad, and the Hillsboro History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company Branch, in all about 131.69 miles of railway, were acquired by the Company by deed and became a part of the system. A portion of this line, from Sciotoville to Portsmouth, 6.85 miles in length parallels the Norfolk &amp; Western, forming a double track and is operated as a part of the main line. From Portsmouth Junction, where the lines diverge, to Cincinnati, a distance, including the Belt Line and the Hillsboro Branch, of 124.84 miles, it is operated as the Cincinnati Division. The fiscal year ending June 30th, 1902, was one of exceptional activity in the coal fields contiguous to the Norfolk &amp; Western lines, lands being purchased, new mines opened, and more attention given to this territory than ever before. This was due to the continued growth of the iron and steel industry, as well as to the fact that the superior quality of Pocahontas coal, not only for the manufacture of coke, but for making steam and for domestic purposes, is generally recognized. Pocahontas Coal and Coke Company The Pocahontas Coal and Coke Company having purchased approximately two hundred and ninety-five thousand acres of the lands in the Pocahontas Field, the directors of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company deemed it necessary for the protection of the interests of the Railway Company to purchase all of the capital stock of the Pocahontas Coal and Coke Company, (except qualifying shares held by the directors of the Company), and joined with that Company in the issue of $20,000,000 Four Per Cent. Purchase Money Mortgage Bonds, due December 1st, 1941, in settlement for the purchase by the Pocahontas Coal and Coke Company of its lands and interests in lands. It was agreed between the Railway Company and the Pocahontas Coal and Coke Company that as between them and on their behalf the Pocahontas Company should pay the principal and interest to become due upon the joint bonds, but this agreement was not to effect the liability of the two companies, or either of them, to the holders of the bonds; the Railway Company and the Pocahontas Company being each jointly and severally liable thereon. Beginning with the year 1906, a sinking fund of two and one-half cents per ton of coal mined is to be set aside and used by the trustees for the redemption of the bonds at not exceeding one hundred and five per cent., and the right is reserved to the Company at any interest period to call in and retire at one hundred and five per cent. all or any portion of the outstanding bonds. The property belonging to the Pocahontas Coal and Coke Company comprises about four-fifths of the Pocahontas Coal Fields, and is about midway between the tidewater terminal of the Norfolk &amp; Western at Norfolk, Virginia, and the Ohio Terminals of the Company at Cincinnati and Columbus; and throughout the greater part of its area the No. 3 or Pocahontas seam of coal is above the water level, persistent and uniform in character and thickness, and at a convenient height above the railway tracks, permitting self-draining mines of great extent and economical working. The Pocahontas Coal and Coke Company does not engage in the mining or buying or selling of coal or coke, its principal purpose being to make leases on royalties to operating companies. During the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1902, Tug Fork Branch, ten miles in length, was about completed, and the property and franchises of the Iaeger &amp; Southern Railway and the Southwest Virginia Railway were acquired; lines projected to penetrate the western portion of the Pocahontas Coal Fields, and of which about six miles were completed and in operation and four additional miles graded. The line of railway, as projected, forms a junction with the main line at Iaeger Station, which is beyond the northern boundary of the Pocahontas Coal Field, follows the waters of the Dry Fork Branch of Tug River, and its tributary, Horse Pen Creek, to its source, crosses the Flat Top Mountain, and thence to a connection with the Norfolk &amp; Western near the southern limit of the Pocahontas Field; the distance being about fifty miles, the greater protion of which is through the Pocahontas Coal Field. Upon and tributary to this line are some twenty-seven thousand acres of coal land owned by the Berwind-White Coal Mining Company, of Philadelphia, an equal area owned by the Farraday Coal and Coke Company, of Pittsburg, and some thirty-two thousand acres of the lands belonging to the Pocahontas Coal and Coke Company, leased to the United States Coal and Coke Company. Naugatuck Branch and Kenova &amp; Big Sandy Railroad The industrial developments on the line, and especially in the Pocahontas Coal Field, made increased transportation facilities necessary. To meet the growth of the western traffic of the road, numerous long double passing sidings were constructed between Vivian and Naugatuck, a distance of 93 miles, the alignment being improved by reducing curvature, the intention being to eventually connect these long sidings to form a second track. Between Naugatuck and Kenova, a distance of eighty-three miles by the line in 1901, were some fifteen miles of grade against the traffic. Instead of building a second track along that line, it was decided to construct a new single track line following the waters of the Big Sandy River from Naugatuck to Kenova, the distance by the latter line being some sixty miles. About thirty-five miles to be constructed as the Naugatuck Branch of the Ohio Extension and the remainder to be constructed under the charter of the Kenova &amp; Big Sandy Railroad Company. The new line to be used for the heavy westbound traffic, the lighter eastbound traffic and empty cars using the old line. When completed, this would give the Company a line from Pocahontas, Tug River, and Thacker coal fields to Portsmouth, Ohio, a distance of two hundred and thirty miles, without adverse grades; and from Portsmouth to Columbus, a distance of one hundred miles, no grades against the traffic exceeding twenty-six feet to the mile, on completion of improvements under construction there. During the fiscal year a line projected by the Radford Southern Railway and Mining Company extending five miles in a southerly direction to limestone quarries and ore properties on the New and Little rivers was acquired by the Company, graded and prepared for the rails. At the close of the fiscal year, History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company the work of double tracking, engaged upon for several years, had so far progressed that out of a total distance of one hundred and forty-five miles from Vivian to the summit of the Blue Ridge, ninety miles of second track were completed and in operation and twenty miles under contract. Frederick J. Kimball Elected President Mr. Henry Fink, who served as President of the Company from October, 1896, having expressed a desire to be relieved of the exacting duties of his position, was, on March 5th, 1902, elected chairman of the board of directors, and Mr. Frederick J. Kimball at the same time retiring from that position and being elected President to succeed Mr. Fink. Mr. L. E. Johnson was appointed Vice President in addition to his duties as general manager. During the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1903, the "Hillsboro Short Line" was built in continuation of the Cincinnati, Portsmouth &amp; Virginia Railroad, which latter line was operated from July 1st, 1902, under a lease of ninety-nine years. Work also progressed satisfactorily on the Kenova &amp; Big Sandy Railroad and Naugatuck Branch, also on the Tug Fork Branch, the Iaeger &amp; Southern Railway, the North Carolina Extension, and the Widemouth Branch from Bluestone through the lands of the Pocahontas Coal and Coke Company. The Company was authorized by the meeting of the shareholders to acquire by purchase, control or merger the lines of railroad, property, and franchises of the Iaeger &amp; Southern Railway Company, the Kenova &amp; Big Sandy Railroad Company and the Guyandot &amp; Tug River Railroad Company, or either of them. A large amount of work was authorized during the year, and placed under contract for branches, second track, improvement and alignment of grades, sidings, enlargement of yards, and other important betterments and improvements. Divisional First Lien and General Mortgage At a special meeting of the shareholders held June 17th, 1904, a resolution was adopted authorizing the creation of an issue of $35,000,000 bonds bearing interest at a rate not exceeding four per cent. maturing July 1st, 1944, but subject to redemption on any first day of January or July after January 1st, 1929, at one hundred and five per cent. A mortgage, dated July 1st, 1904, designated as the Divisional First Lien and General Mortgage was thereupon duly executed to the Guaranty Trust Company of New York as trustee. It constitutes a first lien on the then existing extensions and branches of an aggregate of 195.51 miles that were free from the lien of the First Consolidated Mortgage, (comprising the Cincinnati Division and branches, the Naugatuck Branch and Kenova &amp; Big Sandy Railroad, and the capital stock of the Iaeger &amp; Southern Railway Company, which last Company owned 4.9 miles of completed railroad), and upon such extensions and branches as might be constructed or acquired out of the proceeds of the new bonds, and also constitutes a lien, subject to the First Consolidated Mortgage, upon the properties covered by the latter. Of the bonds thus authorized, $10,000,000 were to be executed immediately and placed in the treasury of the Company. During the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1904, construction work was prosecuted on the Kenova &amp; Big Sandy Railroad and Naugatuck Branch, the Tug Fork Branch was extended above Gary, adding 8.15 miles to the main branch making its total length 14.80 miles from the main line junction at Welch. Rights of way were secured for the extension of the Iaeger &amp; Southern up the Dry Fork of Tug River and extensions were made on the North Carolina extension, the Wide Mouth Branch and the North Fork of Elkhorn Branch. The Roanoke Belt Line of 3.93 miles from the main line to a connection with the Winston-Salem District, south of Roanoke was completed and track laid, and authorization was given for the location and construction of an extension of 3.6 miles from the terminus of the Radford Branch to a point near the junction of the Little and New rivers. During the year the Company acquired a lease of the property of the Columbus Terminal &amp; Transfer Railroad Company in the city of Columbus, greatly enlarging the Company's facilities and enabling the Norfolk &amp; Western to reach important manufacturing establishments. The right to buy the property during the lease was also secured. L. E. Johnson Elected President Mr. L. E. Johnson, formerly Vice President and General Manager, was, on September 30th, 1903, elected President to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Frederick J. Kimball, which occurred July 27th, 1903. Mr. N. D. Maher was promoted from the position of General Superintendent to that of General Manager, and Mr. Arthur C. Needles was promoted to be General Superintendent. During the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1905, the Big Sandy Low-Grade Line, having a total length of 59.16 miles from Naugatuck to Kenova, was completed and put into operation December 15th, 1904. This line and the old road between Naugatuck and Kenova are operated as double track. The Iaeger &amp; Southern Railway was operated from Iaeger to Ritter, 4.9 miles and construction work engaged upon on an extension to a point thirty miles from Iaeger up the Dry Fork Branch of the Tug River. Track was laid and the Clear Fork Branch put in operation April 10th, 1905, from Gordon up the Valley of Clear Fork along the route of the West Virginia Southwestern Railway, the control of which was acquired by the Norfolk &amp; Western, 9.93 miles to coal operations near Coalwood, West Virginia. The extension of the Radford Branch 4.62 miles to a point near the junction of the Lile and New rivers was completed, and work done on the Speedwell extension from Ivanhoe to Cripple Creek a distance of six miles, to reach additional iron ore properties. Control of the Big Stony Railroad, having a length of 10.68 miles from near Ripplemead to Interior, Virginia, was acquired April 1st, 1905. Track was restored on the old roadbed of Big Creek Branch above Richlands, Virginia, and the line extended 4.83 miles, the entire length of the branch being 5.90 miles. History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company The location of the line of the Guyandot &amp; Tug River Railroad was revised and some grading done on the northwest side of Clark's Gap. On May 19th, 1905, the Company acquired by purchase the property of the Columbus Terminal &amp; Transfer Company, coming into possession of all the property, including vacated streets, railroad tracks, warehouses and appurtenances thereof. On March 1st, 1905, Mr. A. J. Hemphill, who had been Secretary of the Company, and of its predecessor, the Norfolk &amp; Western Railroad Company, for a period of twenty-two years, and Assistant Treasurer of the Company since October, 1897, resigned these positions, and Mr. E. H. Alden was appointed his successor as Secretary and Assistant Treasurer. Effective March 1st, 1905, Mr. Wm. G. Macdowell, Treasurer and Assistant Secretary of the Company, was appointed Vice President in charge of the Accounting and Financial departments. Mr. Joseph B. Lacy was appointed to the position of Treasurer, and Mr. H. W. Griffith was appointed Assistant Secretary. During the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1906, a controlling interest was acquired in the capital stock of the Blackstone &amp; Lunenburg Railroad Company. This line extends from Blackstone 5.75 miles to lumber mills on the south side of Nottoway River. Construction work was done on the Forest and Concord branches, the former from a point on the Durham line, westward to Forest, a distance of 7.60 miles, and the latter eastward from the same point to a point on the main line near Concord, a distance of 14.52 miles. These lines were located with a maximum grade against eastbound traffic of 0.5 per cent. and a maximum curvature of four degrees. The Big Creek Branch from near Richlands, Virginia, was extended 1.18 miles to new coal operations. Lick Fork Branch, 0.92 mile long, from a point east of Thacker to the operation of the Red Jacket Consolidated Coal Company, was acquired by the Company, and was extended to the operations of the Thacker Fuel Company, the entire length of the line being 2.79 miles at the close of the fiscal year. The construction work on the Pocahontas &amp; Western Railroad from Pocahontas up Laurel Creek was undertaken and prosecuted vigorously, the expectation being that the line would be completed by the end of 1906. The Clear Fork Branch from Gordon, West Virginia, was extended 1.27 miles, and final revisions made of the line of the Guyandot &amp; Tug River Railroad, much of the right of way being secured along the final location. The Iaeger &amp; Southern Railway was acquired by the Company and operated as the Dry Fork Branch to Berwind, on April 2d, 1906. The permanent arching of tunnels and the construction of stone arch masonry on the Big Sandy Low-Grade Line were finished and most of the heavy slides removed. During the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1907, work was undertaken on several extensions of the Tug Fork Branch, one being an extension of Sand Lick Branch of Tug Fork Branch, another being made above Pageton to Operation No. 12 of the United States Coal and Coke Company, and the third being short spur tracks to their operations No. 10 and No. 11, and to other coal and coke operations on Tug Fork Branch. A spur known as Superior Branch was constructed from Davy, up Davy Creek to the operation of the Superior Pocahontas Coal Company. Negotiations were concluded for the purchase of tracks, right of way, etc., of the Clinch Valley Barytes Company to be operated as the Honaker Branch, extending from a point near Honaker, along Lewis Creek and Clinch River, a length including two spurs of 4.78 miles. An extension of the branch 1.12 miles long to Black Yard on Clinch River, was also undertaken. Lynchburg Belt Line During the fiscal year, the Company conveyed to the Lynchburg Belt Line &amp; Connecting Railway Company the two branches built to relieve traffic congestion on the line, the Railway Company effecting a tracking arrangement whereby, on the completion of the line the Railway Company secured the use, for the movement of its trains, of the tracks and property of the Lynchburg Belt Line &amp; Connecting Railway Company. The length of the main line as projected was 22.12 miles and of the connecting branches about 2.07 miles. The Blackstone &amp; Lunenburg Railway Company extending 5.52 miles southward from Blackstone to Dillard with 0.25 miles of siding was put into operation November 22d, 1906. Extensive repairs and improvements were made on the Big Stony Railway and extensions, and the Interior &amp; West Virginia Railroad Company started the construction of its railroad from the line dividing Giles County, Virginia, from Monroe County, West Virginia, at the projected terminus of the Big Stony Railroad through Monroe County, a distance of 17.55 miles to the line of Craig County, Virginia, to connect there with the Virginia &amp; Potts Creek Railroad. The Virginia &amp; Potts Creek Railroad also began the construction of its line from the county line between Monroe County, West Virginia, and Craig County, Virginia, at the projected terminus of the Interior &amp; West Virginia Railroad, through Craig County, Virginia, 11.15 miles to Potts Creek Post Office, Alleghany County, Virginia. The Pocahontas &amp; Western Railroad completed and put into operation 2.90 miles of its railroad in May, 1907, and on June 30th, 1907, a total of 3.12 miles of track had been laid. The Guyandot &amp; Tug River Railroad secured nearly all the right of way for the main line 62.27 miles long between Clark's Gap and Wharncliffe, West Virginia, and located the Barker Creek Branch, 10.7 miles long from the mouth of Pinnacle Creek up Guyandot River, securing nearly all the right of way therefor, and also located an extension of the Barker Creek Branch, 3.03 miles long to a point on the Guyandot River above the mouth of Slab Fork. Business Depression in 1907 The want of confidence resulting from the attacks made upon corporate interests during the year 1907 brought about a serious impairment of values, a marked contraction of business activity, and practically destroyed the market for long time railway obligations. History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company This forced upon the railroad companies throughout the country not only drastic operating economies, but also the substantial discontinuance of construction and betterment work. A portion of the work on the Norfolk &amp; Western then in progress was, however, of such character and so far advanced, that its completion was of the greatest importance to economical operation, and in some cases the contract obligations growing out of its discontinuance would have been as burdensome as those incurred by its continuance on a restricted scale. In view of the unfavorable outlook for marketing the long term bonds which the Company was entitled to issue by reason of its expenditures on property account, an issue of $7,500,000 Five Per Cent. Two-Year Collateral Gold Notes, dated May 1st, 1908, was made under an agreement of the same date with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York, trustee, secured by a deposit of $10,000,000 Divisional First Lien and General Mortgage Gold Bonds with the trustees. During the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1908, the agreement to sell and convey the branches formerly known as the Concord and Forest branches, to the Lynchburg Belt Line &amp; Connecting Railway Company, was carried out, and the Norfolk &amp; Western received from the Lynchburg Belt Line &amp; Connecting Railway Company its five per cent. bonds in the sum of $2,748,780.28 payable February 1st, 1913. A trackage agreement was executed under date of April 3d, 1908, and the Company used the tracks and property of the Lynchburg Belt Line &amp; Connecting Railway Company for the movement of its trains from April 6th, 1908, the date the line was put in operation. The line extends from Phoebe, near Concord, to Forest, Virginia, comprising 22.33 miles of main line, 1.39 miles of connecting branches and 7.63 miles of sidings. During this fiscal year an extension of Sand Lick Branch up the right fork of Sand Lick 2.13 miles was graded and 1.97 miles of track to the tipple of No. 9 plant of the United States Coal and Coke Company was put in operation. The roadbed of extension of Tug Fork Branch 4.03 miles long, above Pageton was seventy-five per cent. completed, the Freeburn Branch, 1.55 miles in length, was located and completed to coal operations in Kentucky, opposite Delorme, West Virginia, and the Company acquired by purchase the Wayne Branch, extending from Wayne, West Virginia, up the left fork of Twelve Pole River, 7.48 miles, formerly the property of the Big Sandy, East Lynn &amp; Guyan Railroad Company. An extension of the Honaker Branch was completed to Blackford, Virginia, making the total length of the branch 5.49 miles. Construction work of an important character was also done on the Big Stony Railway Extension to Kire, also on the Interior &amp; West Virginia Railroad through Monroe County, West Virginia, on the Virginia &amp; Potts Valley Railroad and the Pocahontas &amp; Western Railroad. Further progress was also made in securing right of way for the main line of the Guyandot &amp; Tug River Railroad 62.27 miles long, and the location of the extension of Barker Creek Branch Extension was completed, a distance of 11.49 miles to a point on Devil's Fork of Guyandot River. Progress was also made in securing rights of way for Pinnacle Creek Branch, Cabin Creek Branch, and Still Run Branch. During the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1909, the Lynchburg Belt Line &amp; Connecting Company was extended 0.64 miles to a connection with the Southern Railway; the Catawba Branch, formerly known as the Catawba Valley Railway, was completed from Salem, Virginia, to the mines of the Cooper Silica and Glass Company, 9.39 miles; Sand Lick Branch 2.12 miles up the Right Fork of Sand Lick was completed; Tug Fork Branch was extended above Pageton 3.70 miles, and Spice Creek Branch 4.54 miles was completed and put into operation from Roderfield, West Virginia, up Spice Creek to coal operations. Poplar Creek Branch, 2.07 miles, was completed and put into operation from a point one mile east of Sands, West Virginia, and Town Hill Branch, 1.42 miles, was completed and put into operation from near Richlands, Virginia, on the Clinch Valley District to coal operations. Winston-Salem Southbound Railway Early in 1909, the Norfolk &amp; Western commenced negotiations which resulted in the approval by the Board on June 24th of the purchase of a one-half interest in the Winston-Salem Southbound Railway Company, a corporation chartered by the General Assembly of North Carolina on January 31st, 1905, with power to construct, maintain and operate a railroad southward from Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the other one-half interest being owned by the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company. The Winston-Salem Southbound Railway Company awarded contracts to build a line from a connection with the Norfolk &amp; Western at Winston-Salem. North Carolina, to a point of connection with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad at or near Wadesboro, North Carolina, a distance of about ninety miles; the line to be operated independently and impartially as between the Norfolk &amp; Western and the Atlantic Coast Line. It occupies a country not heretofore well supplied with railroad facilities, and opens a direct route between the Norfolk &amp; Western Lines and the South Atlantic seaboard via the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. During the fiscal year, the Big Stony Railroad was extended to the line between Giles County, Virginia, and Monroe County, West Virginia, total length of operation 16.65 miles. The Interior &amp; West Virginia Railroad was completed from the terminus of the Big Stony Railway to the Virginia state line to a connection with the Virginia &amp; Potts Creek Railroad, a distance of 17.53 miles, and further progress was made in securing right of way on the located line and branches of the Guyandot &amp; Tug River Railroad and connections, the length of the located main line being 62.27 miles, and of the branches 36.13 miles. The Clear Fork &amp; Oceana Railroad was located from the mouth of Clear Fork on Guyandot River up Clear Fork 24.63 miles, with 17.92 miles of branches, some rights of way having been secured and some grading done. The Barker &amp; Clark's Gap Railroad was located from a point near Low Gap, in Micajah Ridge, to the History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company mouth of Barker Creek, 10.76 miles, with 16.57 miles of branches, some rights of way secured and some grading done. Pursuant to authority given at the annual meeting of the stockholders held October 8th, 1908, the railroad, property and franchises of the West Virginia Southwestern Railway were conveyed to the Norfolk &amp; Western, the line being operated as the Clear Fork Branch. Pursuant to authority given at the annual meeting of the stockholders held October 8th, 1908, the Norfolk &amp; Western acquired the railroad, property and franchises of the Caretta Railway Company, which is operated as the Caretta Branch. Passenger Rate Matter Adjusted During this fiscal year, the legal proceedings in connection with the reduction of passenger rates in Virginia terminated satisfactorily to the Company. After decision rendered by the Supreme Court of the United States on November 30th, 1908, in the case of the Norfolk &amp; Western and other railroads in Virginia, and pending final action of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Virginia, under that decision, application was made by the Company to the State Corporation Commission of Virginia for relief from the then existing but unreasonable passenger rate of two cents per mile, which had been in force during the nineteen months from October 1st, 1907. This application resulted in an order of the Commission made March 16th, 1908, permitting the Company to put into effect from and after April 1st, 1909, a maximum passenger rate of two and one-half cents per mile. Report of this section having been made to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Virginia, that Court, on May 6th, 1909, entered a decree declaring that there was no liability on the Company upon the coupons issued under previous orders of the Court, for passenger fares collected in Virginia during July, August and September, 1907, in excess of the rates of fare based upon the maximum rate prescribed by the State Corporation Commission under its order of April 27th, 1907, and that order having been superseded by the order of March 16th, 1909, the case was stricken from the docket. Petersburg Belt Line During this fiscal year, the Petersburg Belt Line, 8.91 miles in length and connecting tracks aggregating 1.69 miles, was under construction from Poe to a point west of Addison on the main line, running around and to the south of the city of Petersburg, Virginia. This is an important feature of a comprehensive plan of improvement of the Company's facilities in and near that city and will greatly benefit local industries. It will form a second track between the points named, and will furnish a low-grade line for through traffic and for interchange of business with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and the Seaboard Air Line Railway, avoiding the heavier grades and curvatures of the old line through Petersburg and the congestion incident thereto. Its maximum grade is 0.2 per cent. eastbound and 0.4 per cent. westbound, and its maximum curvature is 1.5 degrees. During this fiscal year the Allisonia Branch, 0.6 miles in length to an ore tipple in Big Reed Island Creek, near Allisonia, Virginia, was completed, and right of way secured for extending the Dry Fork Branch 1.72 miles from Canebrake, West Virginia. Right of way was also secured for the Beech Creek Branch, from its junction with Dry Fork Branch to its junction with Indian Creek Branch at the Virginia state line, 1.56 miles. Right of way was also secured for the Indian Creek Branch from its junction with Beech Creek Branch at the West Virginia state line to Cedar Bluff, Virginia, on the Clinch Valley District—12.22 miles; and "Y" connection 0.37 miles at Summit Tunnel was under construction. The Dry Fork Branch and connections form a continuous line from Iaeger on the main line to Cedar Bluff on the Clinch Valley District, and afford a western outlet to the coal lands of the Clinch Valley District. Right of way was secured for the North Fork Branch of Tug Fork Branch from Jeanette, West Virginia, 4.31 miles, with a branch 0.87 miles to projected coal operations. The Lynchburg Belt Line from Phoebe, Virginia, to Forest, Virginia, 24.36 miles, with sidings 7.68 miles, forming a second track between those points, was acquired from the Lynchburg Belt Line &amp; Connecting Railway Company by deed dated April 7th. 1910, and the Blackstone Branch from Blackstone, 5.52 miles, and sidings 0.41 miles, was acquired from the Blackstone &amp; Lunenburg Railway Company, by deed dated April 25th, 1910. The Company also acquired from the Pocahontas &amp; Western Railroad Company the branch westward from Pocahontas, Virginia, 3.29 miles in length. The construction work on the Winston-Salem Southbound line of 89 miles from Winston-Salem to Wadesboro, North Carolina, progressed satisfactorily. On June 30th, 1910, the grading was 83 per cent. and masonry 78 per cent. completed; 75 miles of the roadbed were finished and 18 miles of main track were laid. The railroad, property and franchises of the Interior &amp; West Virginia Railroad Company, including 17.53 miles of main track and 0.37 miles of sidings, and the railroad property and franchises of the Virginia &amp; Potts Creek Railroad Company, including 4.15 miles of main track and 0.32 miles of sidings, were respectively acquired by deeds dated June 21st, 1910, to the Big Stony Railway Company. On June 30th, 1910, the latter Company had 38.33 miles of main track and 1.59 miles of sidings. Norfolk Terminal Railway Company On October 13th, 1909, the Company's passenger station at Norfolk, Virginia, was completely destroyed by fire, and as it was deemed inexpedient to construct it upon the old site, temporary quarters were provided. Subsequent conferences held by the Company's representatives with those of the Virginian Railway Company and the Norfolk Southern Railroad Company, resulted in a plan providing for a joint passenger terminal for these three companies. The Norfolk Terminal Railway Company was accordingly organized February 2d, 1910, to acquire the necessary land and to construct thereon the railway, History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company station, buildings, sheds, tracks and other facilities requisite to a passenger terminal suitable for the passenger traffic of the three companies which contemplate the use of the terminal in common. On June 30th, 1910, architects were employed to prepare plans for the structure, as the general features of location and arrangement had been agreed upon. The new passenger terminal of the Norfolk Terminal Railway will be adjacent to the site of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company's former station site. A seven-story office building and passenger station will be erected with suitable space to be leased for the general offices of the Virginian Railway and the Norfolk Southern Railroad Company, and for such of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company's offices as are located in Norfolk. Miles of Double Track Operated At the close of the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1911, double track work was in progress from Vivian, West Virginia, to Huger, West Virginia, 5.03 miles, including four tunnels and estimated to be completed in November, 1911. The east approach to the Ohio River Bridge at Kenova, West Virginia, is being reduced in grade from 0.5 per cent. to 0.3 per cent., and the viaduct and bridge will be double tracked, removing 0.7 mile of gauntlet. This will be completed late in 1912. With the above named sections completed the Company will have in operation between Lambert's Point, Virginia, and Columbus, Ohio, including as second track the lines around Petersburg and Lynchburg, Virginia, and the Big Sandy Line, 512.09 miles of double track main line, and 191.67 miles of single track, including two gauntlets, 0.38 and 0.55 mile respectively. The single track is between Gilmerton and Phoebe, Virginia, 172.06 miles; between Radford, Virginia, and Coaldale, West Virginia, in sections, 16.46 miles; and between the Pocahontas Coal Field and Columbus, Ohio, 3.15 miles. The main line of the Petersburg Belt Line was put into operation June 29th, 1911. There are 8.87 miles of main line, and 1.69 miles of connecting tracks with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad and the Seaboard Air Line Railway, and 4.06 miles of sidings. The maximum grades are 0.2 per cent. eastbound and 0.4 per cent. westbound. Dry Fork Branch was extended to operation No. 4 of the New River and Pocahontas Consolidated Coal Company. Its total length in operation June 30th, 1911, was 30.11 miles, with 1.04 miles under construction from Canebrake, West Virginia, to the initial point of Beech Creek Branch. Beech Creek Branch, from its connection with Dry Fork Branch to its junction with Indian Creek Branch at the Virginia state line, 1.56 miles, was under construction at the close of the fiscal year, as was also Indian Creek Branch from its junction with Beech Creek Branch at the West Virginia state line to Cedar Bluff, Virginia, 12.22 miles and "Y" connection 0.37 mile at Cedar Bluff. These lines will be completed in 1912 and will make a connection between the main line at Iaeger, West Virginia, and the Clinch Valley District at Cedar Bluff, Virginia, giving a direct outlet to the east for the coal lands already developed on the Dry Fork Branch and for those awaiting development on the new branches, as well as a short line to the west from the Clinch Valley District. It will also be of great importance as a relief line in the Pocahontas coal fields in case of congestion, high water or accident. The North Fork Branch of Tug Fork Branch from Jeanette, West Virginia, 4.31 miles was under construction and expected to be completed before the close of 1911. Sycamore Branch, 2.69 miles, was completed and put into operation from a point 2.8 miles east of Williamson, West Virginia, up Sycamore Creek to the coal operation of the Sycamore Coal Company. Big Stony Railway Acquired Pursuant to authority given at the annual meeting of the stockholders, October 12th, 1910, the railroad, property and franchises of the Big Stony Railway Company were by deed dated December 9th, 1910, conveyed to the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company, and the railroad is now being operated as the Potts Valley Branch. This branch runs from a point near Ripplemead, Virginia, to Paint Bank, Craig County, Virginia, 38.33 miles, with sidings 2.38 miles. Winston-Salem Southbound Completed The Winston-Salem Southbound Railway Company completed its line from Winston-Salem to Wadesboro, North Carolina, a distance of 89 miles, connecting the Norfolk &amp; Western system with that of the Atlantic Coast Line. It connects with the Southern Railway at Winston-Salem, Lexington and Albemarle, and through the Atlantic Coast Line connects with the Seaboard Air Line Railway at Wadesboro. Through train schedules were inaugurated May 1st, 1911. The road and sidings are laid throughout with eighty-five-pound open hearth steel rails. The maximum grades are 0.6 per cent. southbound, and 1.0 per cent. northbound. The maximum curvature is six degrees. All bridges are of concrete and steel, designed to carry the heaviest locomotives now in use. Culverts and under grade crossings are of concrete. Generally, grade crossings of both railroads and highways have been avoided. The capital stock of the Winston-Salem Southbound Railway consists of one thousand two hundred and fifty full paid shares of $100 each, including eight shares held by individuals. The Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company and the Atlantic Coast Line have each subscribed for six hundred and twenty-one shares, which have been deposited with the United States Trust Company of New York, Trustee, under the terms of a trust agreement dated July 20th, 1909. The funded debt consists of $5,000,000 of First Mortgage Fifty-Year Four Per Cent. Gold Bonds, which were sold in January, 1911, the proceeds forming a construction fund, from which the interest bearing certificates of indebtedness due by the Winston-Salem Southbound Railway Company to the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company and the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company for advances made on construction account have all been paid with interest thereon. This line opens a new and direct route for passengers to and from Florida, as well as for freight traffic, which will consist principally of coal from the Norfolk &amp; Western lines and cereals and manufactures from the north and west to the South Atlantic seaboard states, and of vegetables, forest products and phosphates from the territory reached by the Atlantic Coast Line and its connections to the north and west. History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company Work Begun on Norfolk Union Passenger Station Special questions requiring careful consideration delayed the execution of the general plans relating to the union passenger station at Norfolk, Virginia. These were, however, satisfactorily settled, and the Norfolk Terminal Railway Company entered into operating agreements with the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company, the Virginian Railway Company and the Norfolk Southern Railroad Company, under which these three companies are obligated to use the terminal facilities of the Norfolk Terminal Railway Company exclusively for their terminal passenger train business to and from Norfolk. The capital stock of the Norfolk Terminal Company consists of seven hundred and fifty-nine full paid shares of $100 each, including nine shares held by directors. The Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company, the Virginian Railway Company and the Norfolk Southern Railroad Company have each subscribed for two hundred and fifty shares and have deposited the same with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York, Trustee, under the terms of a trust agreement dated May 20th, 1911. A mortgage has been executed by the Norfolk Terminal Railway Company to secure an aggregate of $2,000,000 of Fifty-Year Four Per Cent. Gold Bonds bearing the endorsed guarantee of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company and the Virginian Railway Company. Of these bonds $1,000,000 were sold to provide for the construction of the terminal, the remaining $1,000,000 being reserved for enlargements, betterments and extensions of the properties covered. The land for the terminal facilities has been acquired, the contracts for the station and office building have been let and the work begun. It is expected that the terminal will be ready for use about the middle of 1912, and the total cost thereof is estimated at $950,000. Statistical At the close of the fiscal year ending June 30th, 1911, the total net cost of the road and equipment was $201,207,345.73. The outstanding capital stock of the Company consisted of 742,840 Shares of Common Stock $74,284,000 230,000 Shares of Adjustment Preferred Stock. 23,000,000 Total $97,284,000 of which there was in the treasury $8,300 of adjustment preferred stock.

The formation and construction of this important system of railway has had a marked effect upon every phase of human endeavor throughout the great Southwest. Vast regions of forest and wilderness have been transformed into productive fields and the whole section is teeming with industry of every character. In fact, Southwest Virginia has developed and become enriched far beyond the imagination of those who took the initiative in the projects of railroad construction History of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company culminating in the present trunk line extending from the granaries of the Middle West to its terminals on the Atlantic Coast. The policy of the Company is a progressive one and each section traversed by its lines is accorded cordial coöperation in all matters of material development; every inducement compatible with good business judgment being extended to attract and foster industries along the line of the road. The road itself, with all of the wonderful resources of the country through which it runs, is advertised on an extensive scale in publications currently issued, and by this means many desirable settlers have been attracted to Virginia farms and communities. The equipment, service and regulations of the Company are first-class in every particular and the track is excellently ballasted and laid with the best heavy steel rail obtainable. The regulations of the Company are made in the broadest and most prudent manner possible. Printed rules are furnished all employees, who are required to conform to them strictly, with no deviation except when specific orders to the contrary are given, or unforeseen circumstances affecting the safety of the traveling public necessitate a departure. In consequence of the strict discipline maintained and the excellent regulations governing transportation, accidents and delays are reduced to a minimum; the record of the Company being exceptionally free from disasters causing loss of life or property. The road is under the control of an able and experienced class of officials, and from president to the minor official or employee charged with authority, the utmost care and attention are given to the business affairs of the Company and its dealings with the public. The relations existing between the management of the road and its employees have always been cordial, and differences arising are settled in a spirit of fairness and reciprocity, thereby engendering the feeling of coöperation between employer and employee, so necessary in the conduct of a business of such magnitude. The Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company, in the management of its large interests, and in its attitude towards the public, has displayed a policy which is the embodiment of energy and progress, allied with a strict regard for fair business dealing, and it enjoys the good will and commendation of the general public. Its leading officials have always been ready and willing to coöperate with the public in matters concerning the upbuilding of cities and towns along its lines, and the uniform courtesy and interest manifested have contributed in a marked degree in cementing together the interests of this great corporation and those of the vast section of country which it so ably serves. ROANOKE CITY—Biographical TIPTON T. FISHBURNE Tipton T. Fishburne, the subject of this sketch, was born November 20th, 1849, at Warm Hollow, Franklin County, Virginia, being the seventh son of Samuel and Frances T. Fishburne, and one of a family of twelve children, nine sons and three daughters. His father was a prominent farmer and merchant of the period, and his habits of life were methodical and orderly to a high degree. He was of German extraction, systematic and economical in the conduct of his affairs, and inculcated the habit of strict integrity among his children. His mother was a native of Virginia, of English descent, and possessed among other qualities of mind and heart, a spirit of energy and a devotion to principle, which have been transmitted to her children. Mr. Fishburne's early home training was founded upon broad lines of morality and religious devotion, and the lessons then received, during the formative period of his character, have been of the highest value throughout his long and successful business career. When he attained the age of seven, his early education was begun at one of the "old field schools," so known on account of the buildings being usually located, for the purpose of economy, in a deserted field. Later he entered Oakgrove Seminary, a private school, making excellent progress, and acquiring a good common school education. This school was superior in many respects to most of the schools of its day and time, strict discipline being maintained and educational advantages of an unusual character afforded its pupils. During the latter part of the Civil War, this school was discontinued, but Mr. Fishburne pursued his studies and obtained a general knowledge of the common school branches as well as a knowledge of general business methods and accounting. On February 11th, 1868, although not yet nineteen years of age, he left home, after receiving the consent of his parents, and journeyed to Big Lick, where he entered the employ of Ferguson and Gambill, who conducted a general store. This place of business was on the west side of Commerce Street, where at that time stood the principal business houses of Big Lick, and was one of the leading mercantile establishments of the town. During his employment with Ferguson and Gambill, Mr. Fishburne conceived the idea of taking a collegiate course in order to prepare himself for the ministry, and had some correspondence with Dr. Duncan on the subject of entering Randolph-Macon College. However, after some reflection, he concluded to remain in the mercantile business, and in 1872, he returned to Franklin County to embark in business in Rocky Mount. In the early part of 1872 a copartnership was formed by T. T. Fishburne, R. H. Fishburne, and C. L. Menefee who conducted a general merchandise business in Rocky Mount, the county seat of Franklin County. In the winter of 1872, Mr. Fishburne concluded to go West with the expectation of locating in Iowa, and disposed of his interest in the business at Rocky Mount. On arriving at Big Lick, he had the misfortune to lose his valise through theft, and, pending its recovery, spent the night with Isham Ferguson, his former employer, who proposed selling to him his tobacco factory. After consultation with his brother, Reuben H. Fishburne, he concluded to abandon the idea of going West, and the Fishburne brothers purchased the tobacco business, later selling a third interest to William Taylor, who was engaged in merchandising. The Fishburne brothers bought a two-thirds interest in the general store conducted by Mr. Taylor, and the tobacco business was carried on under the name of Fishburne Brothers &amp; Taylor; while the general store was conducted under the name of Taylor &amp; Fishburne Brothers. In 1879 the Fishburne brothers sold their interest in the store to Wm. Taylor and at the same time acquired his holdings in the tobacco business, continuing the same under the firm name of Fishburne Bros. &amp; Co., having interested J. R. Fishburne as a partner. In 1884 R. H. Fishburne disposed of his interest to T. T. and J. R. Fishburne, who conducted the business until the death of J. R. Fishburne, in 1886, when R. H. Fishburne again became identified with the firm as a partner. T. T. Fishburne remained at the head of the business until 1892, when he sold his interest to R. H. Fishburne, T. J. Phelps, and C. L. Tinsley. The Fishburne Tobacco Factory, during the years in which it was operated had built up a splendid reputation for its products, and its brands were widely known and classed among the finest productions of Virginia and North Carolina leaf. It was the pioneer of the half dozen factories in Big Lick in 1873, and maintained a reputation for the excellence of its brands throughout the whole period of its existence. In 1889 T. T. Fishburne decided to embark in the banking business, and after consulting with other influential business men of Roanoke, he organized the National Exchange Bank of this city, which was chartered with a capital stock of $100,000. Mr. Fishburne has been actively identified with the business of the institution, having served as its first President from 1889 to 1905, a period of sixteen years, being succeeded by J. B. Fishburn, who has since occupied the position of President. Since retiring from the Presidency of the bank he has served as Vice President and Chairman of the Board, and during his connection with the management of the bank it has grown in size and importance until it is now one of the most prominent financial institutions in the South. History of Roanoke City—Biographical Mr. Fishburne has also been closely identified with many of the leading industries and manufacturing establishments of the city, having always evinced a deep interest in every movement set on foot to build up the city industrially, commercially, and financially. He is Vice President and Treasurer of The Virginia Bridge and Iron Company, Vice President of The Stone Printing and Manufacturing Company, President of the Roanoke Twine Mills Corporation, President of the Roanoke Hospital Association, as well as a stockholder and director in many other enterprises. He ranks among the leading financiers and business men of Virginia, and his judgment is sought on questions of importance concerning the affairs of the various institutions with which he is connected as well as upon matters of public interest in the conduct of municipal business. He has been instrumental in large measure in laying the foundation and building up the present splendid system of public schools, which are the pride of Roanoke, having served for a number of years as President of the School Board. He has been one of the leading spirits in the establishment and maintenance of the Roanoke City Hospital, an institution sustained largely by public subscriptions, and which has been of signal service to the community in the work which comes within its province. Mr. Fishburne is a member of Greene Memorial Methodist Church, and in 1882, he organized a Methodist Sunday School which was the first denominational Sunday School in Roanoke. He was made Superintendent of this Sunday School, which at that time was composed of about forty members, J. B. Andrews being Assistant Superintendent, G. L. Stevens, Secretary, and J. M. Tinsley, Treasurer. His connection with the church has been marked by an active and energetic participation in its work, and he has aided by personal services and liberal contributions in expanding its sphere of usefulness and in the inculcation and development of the principles taught by the Christian religion. He has filled many important positions in church work, having represented the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, in four of its General Conferences, and also represented it in 1911, at the Ecumenical Conference held at Toronto, Canada. In 1892 after a return from a trip to the Holy Land, he delivered a series of lectures, on the subject of his travels, and these lectures led him into the evangelical field, where he has labored for the past fifteen years. In this work he has been eminently successful, having been instrumental in adding from eight hundred to one thousand members to the church. He is also interested financially and closely identified with the Southern Seminary of Buena Vista, Virginia, where one hundred and thirty young ladies are receiving an education, in the course of which culture and refinement are strongly emphasized. On October 1st, 1874, he married Miss Callie L. Greer, of Charleston, Illinois, a daughter of Moses C. Greer, formerly of Franklin County, Virginia, and her earnest coöperation and interest in his endeavors, have been of signal service in the discharge of the duties he has been called upon to fulfill. Mr. Fishburne owns a home in Roanoke, where he resides a portion of the year, spending the winter months at a bungalow, owned by him, on Biscayne Bay, Florida. This winter home is at a point affording a beautiful view, and the ample grounds include a fine grove where oranges and other citrous fruits are grown. From the day when he left his home in Franklin County, and received his first business experience in the little hamlet of Big Lick, throughout a career in which he has been identified with affairs of magnitude and importance, his record is that of a man true to his convictions, and steadfast in the practice of the virtues and characteristics with which he was imbued through early home influences and associations. He is held in high esteem by the people of Roanoke, and his life has been one of devotion to his church, service to his fellow-men, and fidelity to the important interests intrusted to his care. HON. HENRY S. TROUT Henry S. Trout, the President of the First National Bank of Roanoke, is the oldest native-born resident of this city. He was born in Roanoke County, Virginia, October 15th, 1841, being a son of John Trout, a native of Rockingham County, who removed to Roanoke at the age of five years, and in the year 1818. Henry S. Trout, the subject of this sketch, was reared on his father's farm, a large part of which constitutes the city of Roanoke and was educated at Roanoke College, which institution he left to enter the Confederate Army as a member of Company I, Twenty-eighth Virginia Infantry, Pickett's Division. He served as lieutenant and was with his company in the Battle of Gettysburg. He was twice slightly wounded during the war. At the close of the war he was released from Johnson's Island, where he was a prisoner, and returning to Roanoke County, followed farming for several years, after which he sold his land and assisted in laying out the city of Roanoke, and was active in the promotion of the many industries now located here. When the First National Bank of Roanoke was organized in 1882, Mr. Trout was called from the plow handle to take charge of this financial institution as its president, which position he has held for nearly thirty years. Under his judicious management the bank has grown to be one of the most stable banking institutions in the South. It has a capitalization of $400,000, a surplus of $400,000, and undivided profits of $150,000. The individual deposits amount to $2,700,000. He has been identified with many of the leading industries and public service corporations of the city since it was chartered in 1884. He was for a number of years President of the Roanoke Gas and Water Company. Politically, he is a Democrat and served eight years in the Virginia Legislature. He was a member of the House of Delegates from 1877 to 1881 and represented the district of the county and city of Roanoke and counties of Montgomery and Craig from 1882 to 1886 History of Roanoke City—Biographical in the State Senate. He served one term as Mayor of Roanoke, being elected to that office in 1892. Fraternally he is a member of the Masonic Order. Religiously he is a Lutheran and has been an elder of that church for many years. On the sixteenth day of May, 1866, he married Annie Thomas, a daughter of John Thomas, of Montgomery County, Virginia. Three children were born to this union, namely: Mary E., who married Junius C. Davenport, Assistant Cashier of the First National Bank; John Trout, a member of the Roanoke City Council and Martha B. Trout, who resides with her parents on West Campbell Avenue. FERDINAND RORER Ferdinand Rorer, the subject of this sketch, was born in Pittsylvania County, Virginia, near Danville, in April, 1827. Early in life, when a mere boy, he went to Pittsylvania Courthouse in the employ of Colonel Bennett and continued with him for several years in the mercantile business. After reaching his majority, he branched out for himself with a store located at "Rough and Ready," in Montgomery County, Virginia, near the town of Snowville, as now located. There he continued in business until about 1850, when he married Julia Ann Hannah at "Solitude," near Roanoke City, then "Big Lick," and moved there to live. The homestead settled by George Hannah, the grandfather of his wife, was granted to him by George III of England. About 1854 or 1855, the Virginia &amp; Tennessee Railroad was constructed through this section, and he bought a farm of the Shirey heirs, which adjoined the land of his wife, and also the land of John Trout along Commerce Street, including all the land on which is situated the West End of the city of Roanoke, and became a large farmer owning a large number of slaves and raised large crops of tobacco and wheat. He had increased his lands and slaves by purchasing more slaves and fifteen hundred acres of land in Pulaski County, Virginia, so that at the close of the war he had nearly one hundred negro slaves, young and old. After losing his slaves he did not farm on so large a scale, but continued to farm and manufacture tobacco at Big Lick till about the year 1882, when he engaged largely in railroad contracting, and the purchase and development of iron ore properties, being the builder and owner of the Rorer Iron Mines near Roanoke, Virginia, and the railroad leading to same, besides owning large iron properties in Craig, Botetourt and Montgomery counties in Virginia. He also became interested in the development of the present city of Roanoke, having laid off the first town lots and employed the first real estate agent in the person of the late J. A. Dalby. These lots were laid off in what was a beautiful oak grove, fronting on Commerce Street, from the present site of the courthouse out to Franklin Road, near the site of the large grammar school now being erected. He also laid off and constructed, for the most part at his individual expense, through his lands, all the streets running west and parallel with the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway from Commerce Street to the West End Furnace, embracing all the land between the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway on the north and Ferdinand Avenue on the south, and with the Roanoke River as far west as the furnace. Ferdinand Rorer built the first town hall, known as "Rorer Hall," for the city of Roanoke, and was among the city's first councilmen, as well as one of the first hotel proprietors, building and operating the "Rorer Park" Hotel, which was occupied by a great many new comers to the young growing town who have become permanent citizens, and are now living here, among them being the Rev. W. C. Campbell, for whom was named the principal street running in front of the hotel, "Campbell Avenue," as was Patterson Avenue named for Patterson H. Rorer. Rorer Avenue, Ferdinand Avenue and Ernest Avenue, being named for members of the Rorer family. He also dedicated to the First Presbyterian Church the land on which it is built and with his teams and at his own expense for the most part, hauled the Old Presbyterian Church from Gainsborough, or "Old Lick" as it was called, and helped to erect it where the handsome new church now stands, the old church being moved to the rear and is now used as a Sunday School room. He was a member of the Presbyterian Church, being converted under the ministry of the Rev. C. H. Howard, in 1873, and joined the church at the time of his conversion.

Gale, one of Roanoke's oldest as well as leading physicians and surgeons, has been prominently identified with the medical fraternity in this section of Virginia for many years; for nearly a half century filling the important position of Chief Surgeon of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway. Dr. Gale is a son of Enoch R. and Louisa Gale, and was born in Norfolk, Virginia, December 3d, 1842. As a boy he attended the schools of his native city, and was a student at the Norfolk Military Academy. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he enlisted under Captain Frank Huger's battery of field artillery, serving for about eighteen months, and participated in the battles around Richmond, Virginia. He was then transferred to the medical department of the Confederate Army as hospital steward, in charge of the dispensary of Chimborazo Hospital, Richmond, remaining there until the close of the war. By special order of the Surgeon General of the Confederate Army, he was permitted to matriculate at the Medical College of Virginia while in the army hospital service, and it was at this institution that he laid the foundation for the professional education which, after the war, was supplemented by a course at Bellevue Hospital Medical College, New York, graduating from that institution in 1866. For nearly a half century he has been in the active and uninterrupted practice of his profession. He has, at all times, interested himself in the various medical organizations of the country, being a member of the American Medical Association; International Association of Railroad Surgeons; Medical Society of Roanoke; Southern Surgical and Gynecological Society; Medical Society of Virginia, being President of the latter in 1903-4. With a membership of nearly two thousand in that body it is esteemed a great honor to be elected as the presiding officer. He is an enterprising, public spirited citizen and a large investor in Roanoke real estate, owning and controlling some of the best business property in the city. For many years he has been closely identified with a number of enterprises which have been largely instrumental in the city's advancement and prosperity. Dr. Gale is a Methodist religiously, and was actively identified with the building of the first Methodist church erected at Big Lick, and afterwards was Treasurer of the building committee in the erection of the old Greene Memorial Church, now occupied as a place of worship by St. Mark's Lutheran congregation. In June, 1869, he married Pattie Burwell Harvey, daughter of Robert Harvey, Esq., of Roanoke County, Virginia. She died eleven months later. Secondly, on October 5th, 1875, he married Eliza Simmons, daughter of Captain Sparrell F. and Isabel (Harvey) Simmons. Mrs. Simmons was the daughter of Colonel Lewis Harvey. To his second marriage two children were born, namely: Dr. Sparrell Simmons Gale and Charlotte Dryden Gale. PEYTON LEFTWICH TERRY The subject of this sketch was born in Campbell County, Virginia, February 2d, 1835, and died in the city of Roanoke, Virginia, on December 18th, 1898. He was a son of Stephen and Lucinda Leftwich Terry, and came to Roanoke County and located at Big Lick in 1851, where he engaged in the mercantile business. On December 16th, 1857, he was married to Mary S. Trout, daughter of John and Eliza J. Trout, and a sister of Hon. Henry S. Trout. Their union was blessed with the following children: Lila M., Alice P., Martha L., Annie D. and Lulu L. Alice P. married Samuel W. Jamison, and Martha L. married T. W. Goodwin, both of Roanoke City; Annie D. died January 14th, 1883. Mr. Terry volunteered for service in the Confederate Army and served four years in the Twenty-eighth Virginia Infantry. His company was commanded by Captain Madison P. Deyerle. Mr. Terry was captured three days before the surrender and was held a prisoner at Point Lookout for History of Roanoke City—Biographical sixty days. On his release from prison, he returned to Big Lick and with the same indomitable energy and the same fortitude and courage that marked his conduct in war, and that later won success in his business life, he set about helping to build up and restore the peace and prosperity of his state and section. From the beginning of his business career, Mr. Terry was always a leader in every movement that contributed to the upbuilding of this section and in 1874, while Mr. John Trout was the mayor of the town, Mr. Terry was elected and served as a member of the town council. At that time the lands on which the city of Roanoke now stands, was owned by John Trout, William Carr, Isham Ferguson, Mrs. Jane Lewis, Colonel Thomas and Major Andrew Lewis, Benjamin T. Tinsley, and Mr. Terry, who owned the splendid estate known as "Elmwood," which is now held by the city of Roanoke as a park. In 1881 the plans to build the Shenandoah Valley Railroad were matured and it was due, very largely, to the prompt and effective efforts put in motion by Mr. Terry that the terminous of that road was secured for Big Lick in place of Salem, resulting in the building on the site of the village of Big Lick the splendid and progressive city of Roanoke. As a village merchant, Mr. Terry was unusually successful and by the time the city of Roanoke sprang into existence he had the largest business establishment in the county and erected the first brick business house in the village and by his close attention, keen business acumen and sterling integrity, had developed from a small beginning into a large wholesale and retail establishment and enjoyed the confidence and esteem of all who knew him. As a business man, he was progressive and full of energy, quick to see and grasp opportunities for success, was by nature and temperatment exceptionally well fitted to be a leader in the commercial and financial development of the city of Roanoke of which he he was so proud. But it was as a friend and neighbor that those who knew him best loved to think of him most. No better, truer or more generous husband and father lived, and the visitor to his family circle at once felt the warm, gracious and genial atmosphere of the unostentatious hospitality of a gentle Christian household, presided over with so much grace and dignity by Mrs. Terry, who was truly one of God's gracious and noble gentlewomen. As a friend and neighbor, Mr. Terry's heart was overflowing with the milk of human kindness and his hands ever ready to respond to the calls of the needy, and in poverty and distress many households in this city were recipients of his generosity who never knew their benefactor's name. His greatest pleasure was to help deserving young men and women to make a success in life, and numbers of young men who are now successful in their various avocations treasure the memory of his kindly encouragement and substantial help as their most valued possessions. WILLIAM CREIGHTON CAMPBELL, D. D. The gentleman whose name captions this article was born in Gerrardstown, Berkeley County, Virginia, now West Virginia, and is a son of Hugh Lyle Campbell and Mary Eliza (Van Metre) Campbell. His ancestors have lived in Berkeley County, West Virginia and Frederick County, Virginia, for nearly two centuries. On his mother's side his people were of Dutch descent, the original emigrants coming from Holland to New York in 1630. A century later John and Isaac Van Metre migrated from New York to the Valley of Virginia, and held the first grants of land in the valley. The grant consisted of about forty thousand acres of the finest lands lying along the Opequon Creek and the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers. This was known as the "Great Grant." Dr. Campbell's great, great grandfather is said to have been the first white child born in the Valley of Virginia, west of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The will of John Van Metre, his ancestor, made in 1745, is still on record in Winchester, Virginia. On his father's side Dr. Campbell descended from Scotch and Scotch-Irish ancestry. The Campbells and Lyles came into the valley about 1760 and settled in Berkeley and Frederick counties. His ancestors were active in the early struggles antedating the Revolution. His great grandfather, James Campbell, was an officer in the Continental Army and was wounded in one of the battles in New Jersey. His grandfather, Dougal Campbell, was a major in the War of 1812. His maternal grandmother was Sarah Wallace Lyle. William Creighton Campbell attended the schools of his native village and in early life determined upon the ministry as a profession. With this end in view he entered Hampden-Sydney College and after graduating from that institution, became a student at the Union Theological Seminary of Virginia and for three years studied under such tutors as Robert L. Dabney, B. M. Smith, Thomas E. Peck, and Henry A. Alexander. After being ordained as a minister by the Presbytery of Winchester, he took charge of the Presbyterian Church at Harpers Ferry and remained there for two years. In 1881 he received a call and came to Big Lick, now Roanoke. Here for nearly thirty-one years he has lived and labored. His church, the First Presbyterian, has grown from a membership of sixty to seven hundred. It has established missions out of which four other churches have grown. He was made a Doctor of Divinity by Hampden-Sydney College and subsequently was elected a trustee of that institution. Dr. Campbell was elected Moderator of the Synod of Virginia and was one of the three ministers appointed by that body to raise the Century Fund proposed by the Southern Presbyterian Church. It would be hard to name a man whose history is more closely identified with Roanoke and its phenomenal growth from a village of five hundred to a city of nearly forty thousand population, than Dr. Campbell. One of his most trying experiences during his long residence in this city was, when he prevented a howling mob from dragging the body of a negro who had been History of Roanoke City—Biographical lynched, through the streets and burying it in the yard of a leading citizen. On June 7th, 1882, he was married to Anna Gale Child of Harpers Ferry, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. C. Child and as a result of that union they have five children; namely, Creighton Child, an Electrical Engineer; John Blake, a student at Cornell College, who is studying Hydro-Electrical Engineering; Emily, Anna, and Mary Campbell, who are at home at the Manse No. 324 Church Avenue. Mrs. Campbell departed this life March 12th, 1907, and the remains were laid to rest in the old church yard at Gerrardstown, West Virginia. JOHN TROUT John Trout, the subject of this sketch, was born in Rockingham County, Virginia, February 13, 1813, and died in Roanoke, Virginia, 1882, and his remains rest in the city cemetery. He was a son of George and Polly (Miller) Trout of Rockingham County and moved with his father to Botetourt (now Roanoke) County, in 1818, where George Trout purchased a farm a few miles west of the present city of Roanoke, where the subject of this sketch was reared. When twenty-five years old, he purchased the Stover property, near Big Lick, a tract of land containing two hundred and fifty acres, for which he paid $27.00 per acre, and when Roanoke City was established, a large part of it was located on this farm. He improved and added to the Stover house, built by William Stover in 1797, and occupied the same as his residence until the time of his death. For many years he operated it as a house of entertainment and the "Trout House" was known far and wide to the traveling public. The Ponce de Leon now stands on the old "Trout House" site. During the Civil War, no soldier was ever charged for entertainment at the "Trout House" and the proprietor kept several teams engaged in transporting sick soldiers and the remains of the dead from the railroad to their homes and friends, all of which was done without charge. He was open-handed and to the needy his purse was as open as his heart. He was essentially a man of deeds, not words. He served the people of Roanoke County in various public capacities, having been Assessor of the Revenue, and was a Justice of the Peace for fifty years. He was twice a councilman and was Mayor of Big Lick from the time it was first incorporated until a short while before his death. He ably represented Roanoke County in the State Legislature after the war and was a member of the Board of Trustees of Roanoke College and in 1868 he was elected President of the Board which position he held until his death. He was the first founder of the Lutheran Church in Big Lick, holding the office of Deacon and Elder for many years. He was the senior partner of the firm of Turner, Trout &amp; Co., tobacco dealers, and was widely known in business circles. He was twice married. His first wife was a daughter of Henry Shaver of Roanoke County and the children to this marriage were Hon. H. S. Trout and Mrs. Peyton L. Terry, the latter deceased. His second wife was Martha B. Potter of Franklin County, Virginia. BALLARD PRESTON HUFF The gentleman whose name captions this article is a son of Isaac H. and Lucinda Huff, and was born near Copper Hill, Floyd County, Virginia, January 28th, 1853. His father came to Roanoke County in 1863 and purchased a large farm on the south side of the city. Ballard Preston Huff was educated in the private schools of Roanoke County and at the Agricultural and Mechanical College at Blacksburg, being the first student to matriculate at that institution of learning, on October 1st, 1872. This is now the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and is one of the leading educational institutions in the South. Mr. Huff came to Big Lick, Virginia, in 1875, and traveled for a tobacco house for a period of one year. In 1878 he accepted a position with P. L. Terry in the general merchandise business and was with him as clerk and partner for a period of ten years. In 1888, Mr. Huff organized the wholesale grocery firm of Huff, Andrews &amp; Thomas. The firm was composed of B. P. Huff, J. B. Andrews, F. B. Thomas and W. H. Thomas. This business was conducted successfully for many years and, in the meantime, the company established seven other wholesale grocery houses at the following places: Bluefield, West Virginia; Norton, Virginia; Abingdon, Virginia; Galax, Virginia; Williamson, West Virginia; Logan, West Virginia, and Pikeville, Kentucky. For many years this was one of the largest wholesale grocery firms in the entire State. In 1897, the wholesale dry goods firm of F. B. Thomas &amp; Company was organized by the old members of the firm of Huff, Andrews &amp; Thomas. This concern occupies handsome, commodious quarters on Campbell Avenue, opposite the proposed site of the new city hall. F. B. Thomas &amp; Company are in command of a steadily increasing business throughout their trade territory. Ballard Preston Huff has retired from active business life and is now engaged in looking after his private business affairs. He had unbounded faith in Roanoke and stuck to her during the panic and in adversity. This demonstrates beyond the shadow of any reasonable doubt that the men who remained here and kept eternally at it succeeded in business. As a "builder of Roanoke," Mr. Huff has contributed a liberal share. He sold Solitude Farm to the Virginia Heights Corporation and this is destined to become the best suburban property around Roanoke. Mr. Huff is a director and one of the Vice Presidents of the City National Bank. He is interested in various other enterprises in the city and has invested heavily in orchards in Patrick County. Mr. Huff was the first president of the present Chamber of Commerce and was present at the meeting of citizens held in the early eighties when the movement was inaugurated that brought the Shenandoah Valley Railroad to Roanoke. History of Roanoke City—Biographical In 1884 he was married to Miss Florence Thomas, daughter of Charles and Jane Thomas and as a result of that union they have one daughter, Alice Huff. Fraternally Mr. Huff is a Mason. Religiously he is a member of the First Presbyterian Church. Mr. Huff resides in South Roanoke, near Crystal Spring. HON. ROBERT H. ANGELL Robert H. Angell was born in Franklin County, Virginia, January 25th, 1868. As a "Maker of Roanoke" he stands in the front ranks. A self-made man and the chief owner of a large establishment, such as the Central Manufacturing Company, he occupies a foremost position in Roanoke's commercial and industrial life. He has seen Roanoke grow from the acorn of Big Lick into the stately oak of today. When a mere boy he left his Franklin County home and attended the public schools of Salem, where he worked his way by acting as janitor of the building. During the vacation period he accepted a position in a lumber yard in Roanoke. His indomitable energy and business instincts soon made him manager of the yard. Later he took an interest, and organized the firm of Huff &amp; Angell, so well known in the early days of Roanoke. Three years later he bought the interest of his partner, and began the manufacture of building material, a more complete account of which is found under another head in this work. Mr. Angell has always stood for the material welfare of Roanoke and her advancement, and as such has fostered many enterprises. He is a leading spirit of the Roanoke Iron Company, and did much towards securing the cotton mill for this city. For four years he was President of the Chamber of Commerce. Last year he refused reölection owing to the pressing demands of his large private interests. While President of that body he was active and always on the alert for Roanoke. Much of his valuable time was taken in matters of civic interest and on several occasions when he felt that the circumstances justified it, he personally bore the expenses necessary to be incurred in securing for Roanoke industries and enterprises which would redound to the common good. A republican in politics, he was elected in 1901 to represent the city of Roanoke and the counties of Roanoke and Craig in the State Legislature of Virginia. He is the only Republican ever elected from the district. During the present year he was elected President of the Colonial Bank &amp; Trust Company of this city, a banking institution with an authorized capital stock of half a million dollars. In 1897 Robert H. Angell, married Mary J. Barlow, a native of Pennsylvania and a daughter of A. Barlow. Her parents are dead. To them the following children have been born: Robert E., Joseph, Franklin Randolph, Henry Clay, Hughes T., Ernest L., (deceased), and Arthur L. Angell.

K. of the Mystic Shrine, a Red Man, an Elk, a Pythian, an Odd Fellow, Mystic Chain, Eagles and the Shenandoah Club, and religiously he is a Baptist. REUBEN H. FISHBURNE Farmer, merchant, soldier, manufacturer, capitalist, and philanthropist, aptly describes Reuben H. Fishburne, a member of the first Town Council of Big Lick, and at present a wealthy citizen of Roanoke, who has retired from active business life. He was born in Franklin County, Virginia, February 27th, 1835, being a son of Samuel and Frances Fishburne. His parentage was of sturdy old Virginia stock, and the son inherited largely the noble qualities of his ancestry. Mr. Fishburne belongs to a long lived race of people. He enjoys the unique distinction of having eight grandparents and great grandparents living at the time of his birth, seven of whom he grew up to know intimately. The eighth he never knew personally, as she moved away from the neighborhood a short time before he was born. On April 27th, 1873, he married Emma Virginia Phillips, daughter of Joshua and Sallie Clark (Hughes) Phillips of Campbell County, Virginia. To this union five children, one son and four daughters were born, namely: Blair J., Annie L., Fannie T. (deceased), Sallie C., and S. Ella. Fraternally Mr. Fishburne is a Pythian. Religiously he is a member of Greene Memorial Methodist Church, and a former member of the Board of Stewards. He placed the city under lasting obligations to him for the town clock, which he installed in the tower of Greene Memorial Church, in connection with his gift of the chimes and pipe organ to the congregation. As a boy he attended the old field schools of Franklin County, obtaining a fair education. For a number of years he was engaged in farming pursuits, and when the war broke out between the states, he was one of the first to respond to his country's call, joining Company A, Thirty-Seventh Battalion, Virginia Cavalry, and serving under General William E. Jones until the time of his death, June 5th, 1864. During the first years of the war, the Thirty-Seventh Battalion was engaged in Southwest Virginia and West Virginia, and in the Valley of Virginia, during the last year or more of the bloody conflict. Mr. Fishburne's company was in the Hanging Rock skirmish with Hunter's Army, an account of which is given elsewhere in this volume. The war over, he returned to his home in Franklin History of Roanoke City—Biographical County where he sought to rebuild the losses sustained during the four years' conflict. For a short time he was engaged in mercantile pursuits at Rocky Mount. In 1873 he removed to Big Lick where he engaged in the manufacture of tobacco, both "plug" and "smoking." For more than fifteen years the firm of Fishburne Brothers, composed of R. H. and T. T. Fishburne, continued the business, after which, and for an additional sixteen years, only high-grade smoking tobacco was manufactured until the year of 1905, when the subject of this sketch retired from active business life. Since then he has traveled extensively, and has been deeply interested in the welfare of his old comrades in gray, who fought with him for the "lost cause." During the year 1910 he published a history of his old company in a neatly bound volume, a copy of which was presented to each survivor, as well as to the widows of his deceased comrades. It was largely through his beneficence that the handsome monument recently erected in memory of the Confederate dead of of his native county, now graces the Courthouse Square at Rocky Mount. In latter years he has extended help whenever needed to his old comrades in arms, it affording him much pleasure to draw on his own resources for their benefit. As a builder of Roanoke, he as a member of the firm of Fishburne Brothers, was among the few who subscribed liberally towards securing the terminus of the Shenandoah Valley Railroad, and he has been interested financially and in an advisory capacity with a number of the city's leading institutions, being a director of the National Exchange Bank, the Virginia Bridge and Iron Company, and the Brand Shoe Company, as well as a stockholder in many others of the leading financial institutions of the city. FRANCIS SORREL, M. D. Francis Sorrel, M. D., distinguished in the Confederate States Army for services rendered in the medical department, was born in Savannah, Georgia, in 1827. He was educated in Princeton, New Jersey, graduating in 1846. He then spent two years at the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in medicine in 1848. He then entered the United States Army as an assistant surgeon, serving until 1856, when he resigned his commission with the rank of captain. After traveling in Europe a year, he went to California where he rapidly attained prominence and in 1860 was elected to the California Legislature. In the following year, he returned to the East to offer his services to the Confederacy. He was promptly commissioned as surgeon in the regular army, and assigned to special duty of great importance which was due largely to his experience and unusual ability, with headquarters at Richmond, Virginia, where he was charged with the erection and management of the general hospital system of the army, and where he remained until the evacuation of the Confederate Capital. In March, 1865, he married the widow of Dr. L. Rives, who was a daughter of General Edward Watts of Roanoke County, and since the Civil War period, until recently, has led the life of a simple retired country gentleman on his splendid farm, "The Barrens," a few miles to the northwest of Roanoke. Dr. Sorrel is of the type of Southern gentlemen which is rapidly passing away. He has at all times manifested a keen interest in the development and growth of Roanoke and has been identified with a number of enterprises in a financial way. Recently he has made his home in Roanoke, but much of his time is spent in visiting points of interest in various sections of the country. SAMUEL WILLIAM JAMISON Samuel William Jamison was born in Franklin County, Virginia, April 27th, 1850. In 1871 he located in Big Lick, now Roanoke, his first business engagement being in the general store on Commerce Street, conducted by the late Peyton L. Terry. Mr. Jamison established the first warehouse in Roanoke for the sale of leaf tobacco, which he successfully operated for several years, after which he engaged in the wholesale tobacco business. For a number of years he was identified with the banking interests of Roanoke, and for about eight years was President and General Manager of the Roanoke Street Railway Company, and was Vice President of the Roanoke Light Company. It was under his management that the street car system was equipped with electricity, horse and steam power giving away to the more modern means of locomotion. During the early days of Roanoke, he was a member of the city council and served in that body when the original water franchise for the city's water supply was adopted. Following the sale and consolidation of the street railway and electric lighting plant to other interests, Mr. Jamison embarked in the lumber business, operating under the name of the Exchange Lumber Company. He is President and Manager of the Company which for the past thirteen years has been a most important factor in the up-building of Roanoke. Mr. Jamison has been identified with other large interests of the city, such as the Roanoke Gas &amp; Water Company, The West End Land Company, The Belmont Land Company, The Crystal Springs Land Company, and others. He was one of the principal promotors of the building of the Roanoke and Southern into Roanoke, and was also active in securing the Southern terminal of the Shenandoah Valley for Big Lick. JUNIUS B. FISHBURN Junius B. Fishburn, the subject of this sketch, was born at Boone's Mill, Virginia, in 1865, and has been actively identified with business interests in Roanoke since 1887. In 1889 he was prominent with T. T. Fishburne in organizing the National Exchange Bank of this city, History of Roanoke City—Biographical which has since proven to be one of the leading and most stable financial institutions of the South. The bank was incorporated with a capital of $100,000, and was first located on Salem Avenue, near its junction with Jefferson Street. It afterwards removed its quarters to the southeast corner of Salem Avenue and Jefferson Street, and later to the present National Exchange Bank Building at the intersection of Campbell Avenue and Jefferson Street, one of the most central points in the city. The capital stock of the National Exchange Bank is now $300,000, with surplus and undivided profits of $500,000, and deposits amounting to nearly $3,000,000. In order to meet the growing requirements of its business the bank recently acquired a tract of land fifty by one hundred feet in size, immediately opposite its present quarters, and will at once erect a commodious building to be used exclusively for banking purposes. When completed it will be one of the handsomest and best arranged bank buildings in the United States, equipped with all modern furnishings and supplied with every accessory requisite for the banking business. Since the organization of the National Exchange Bank, Mr. Fishburn has held two positions during his twenty-two years' connection with the institution, first as cashier and later as its president. His close personal attention to the affairs of this institution has contributed in large measure to the success achieved by the bank and its prominence among the financial institutions of the country. He has also been identified with a number of the leading manufacturing enterprises of the city, and has aided in every movement for the advancement and upbuilding of Roanoke. HON. M. C. THOMAS M. C.

They were respectively of Welsh and English extraction and emigrated to the United States in the early part of the nineteenth century. His father was a railroad conductor and died in 1876, at the age of sixty-nine years, leaving four sons and three daughters: William H. Lewis, the gentleman whose name captions this article, was one of the sons and he attended the public schools of his native county. When about thirteen years old he entered, as an apprentice, the shops of the New York Central Railway. Before he had passed through his apprenticeship he joined the 14th New York Regiment as drummer boy, and served in the war between the states until October, 1861, when he was discharged on account of his youth. He resumed his work as an apprentice, at the expiration of which time he worked as a machinist in the Brooklyn Navy Yards. In 1864, he located in Quincy, Illinois, and served as a machinist on the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad. A year later he was a locomotive engineer for the Hannibal &amp; St. Joe Railroad, which at that time was the only railroad connecting the Mississippi and the Missouri rivers, having charge of the first locomotive used in the territory west of the Missouri River. At that time the vast plains of the West, now dotted with towns and cities, were inhabited by tribes of hostile Indians and swarmed with immense herds of buffalo. He remained with that railroad company, until 1873, when he received the appointment as Master Mechanic of the Northern Pacific Railroad, which had just been finished as far as Fort Abraham Lincoln, the extreme military post of the United States, garrisoned by General George S. Custer of the 7th Regiment of United States Cavalry, fated afterwards to annihilation at the hands of "Sitting Bull" and his band of Sioux Indians. In his capacity as Master Mechanic of this road, it was Mr. Lewis' good fortune to contract lasting friendships with the leading army officers in command in that section of the country. In 1878, he assumed charge of the Second Division of the Kansas Pacific Railroad, where he remained for four years.

This position he held until July 1897, when he was appointed to his present position as Superintendent of Motive Power of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company. Since his connection with this road it has made a marvelous increase in power equipment and Mr. Lewis being able to meet all the requirements of his position marks him as a man of unusual ability. He is a member of the Western Railway Club; American Railway Master Mechanics Association; and in the past has served as President of both of these organizations. He is also a member of the Northwestern, New York and Richmond Railway Club, and in 1905 was a delegate to the International Railroad Congress held in Washington, D.

He served with distinction while a member of the City Council, and discharged with rare ability the duties incumbent upon his position as Chairman of the Joint Committee on Finance. During his occupancy of that position, a large bond issue was voted for municipal improvements, and the sale of these bonds, as well as the disbursement of the funds for the various improvements scheduled, became the duty of the committee of which he was chairman. These matters, in conjunction with the current work devolving upon the Finance Committee, called for business ability of a high character, and the policy inaugurated by Mr. Byrne in basing appropriations upon the previous year's income, instead of the current year's receipts, proved of special benefit in conserving the financial interest of the city. He displayed marked ability in the performance of his varied official duties and guarded the finances of the city with close vigilance, exercising due care in the matter of appropriations in order that each department might receive its proper proportion of the current income, and yet keep within the bounds of the city's revenue. His financial policy in this regard received the highest commendation from the public generally, and his official services are regarded as having been of lasting benefit to the city.

Bell, of Lynchburg, conducted the business for a period of three years, under the firm name of Fairfax &amp; Bell. This establishment was later sold to the Roanoke Hardware Company. Mr. Fairfax then engaged in the real estate business in Roanoke, under the firm name of R. R.

Dr. Cannaday has always taken an active interest in municipal affairs and was a member of the City Council for two years and City Physician for a similar period. While a member of the City Council, it was largely through his influence that the Gish farm was purchased by the city. This act was severely criticised at the time by a great many people but the wisdom of the city fathers has been amply demonstrated, since the property has increased in value several times over. In 1889 he was married to Miss Della, daughter of the late W. H. Poff, of Floyd County, and as a result of that union they had five children, four boys and one girl. In 1906 Mrs. Cannaday died and three years later he was married to Miss Ruth, daughter of Capt. and Mrs. G. P. Eliason and they have one son.

He received his education in the Sharpsburg Schools, and during the vacation period clerked in his father's store. At the age of twenty-one years he embarked in business for himself at Sharpsburg, but after fourteen months he removed to Roanoke, Virginia, July 20th, 1890, where he purchased the grocery business of Scott &amp; Cyphers on the northeast corner of Wells Avenue and Third Street, northeast. Later he purchased lots on the southeast corner where a new store house had been erected, where for many years he conducted a successful grocery and general merchandise store. As the city of Roanoke grew, his business throve. Immense additions were built to the original store, and other departments added until to-day, the name of Renner is almost a household word in Roanoke. He led the pace in Roanoke in the adoption of modern store fixtures. Other lines of goods were added and to-day he conducts one of the largest and most successful department stores in the city. Politically W. E. Renner is a Republican and he was elected to the City Council on the Republican Ticket from the Third Ward, in 1901, serving one term, ably representing his constituents as well as the people of the city at large, being a member of the following committees: Ordinances, Schools, Trade and Commerce, and Official Map. In 1905 after the new constitution of Virginia had provided for the Bi-cameral Council he was elected as a member of the Board of Aldermen from Kimball Ward, and was reölected again in 1909, as an independent candidate. As an Alderman he has been a member of the following committees: Accounts, Streets, Finance, Sewers, Lights, Health, and Schools.

He was a son of Samuel and Lucy Carr, who with his family removed to Buckhannon, Lewis County, West Virginia, when William was a small boy. Left an orphan at the age of sixteen when paternal control was much needed, and thrown upon his own resources, his earlier life was marked by the same honorable conduct that characterized his career in later years. In early manhood he located in Grafton, West Virginia, where for a period of twenty years he was a trusted employee of the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad, serving respectively as Conductor, Station Agent, and Superintendent of Bridge Construction, all of which positions he filled with credit to himself and satisfaction to the company. On November 26th, 1882, he came to Roanoke, and in 1886 was elected Mayor of the rapidly growing city, and was reölected in 1888. After announcing his candidacy for a third term, he withdrew from the race, owing to impaired health and an illness from which he never recovered. His second term of office was not unmixed with personal and political conflicts somewhat discouraging in their nature. As Mayor, he was acting Police Justice, and consequently a terror to evildoers in the earlier history of Roanoke. The last six months of his administration was especially marked with dissension and strife in political circles, but whatever differences of opinion may have been entertained as to his methods of preserving the peace, as well as developing a high moral tone in the city government, there can be no question, but that he was actuated by the highest and best motives in the discharge of his arduous duties. He had set for himself a high standard of duty in the administration of the office of the chief executive of the city, and he labored diligently and faithfully to attain to its fullest requirements. He was a man of Spartan courage and determination, and was always equal to the demands of his office, whether in dealing with subordinates or with offenders against the laws of the city or commonwealth. He was twice married, first to Lavinia Keener of Grafton, West Virginia, five children being born to this union; namely, Richard, John D., William M., Lucy, and Annie. He married secondly Susie H.

In May, 1898, he became a partner in the firm of Taylor &amp; Payne, located at 112 South Jefferson Street and the business at once took place in the front ranks of the men's furnishing emporiums of the city. In 1903 Mr. Payne purchased his partner's interest and has since conducted the business in his own name. He has succeeded in building a reputation for his History of Roanoke City—Biographical house, which is second to none in the State, and his store is a model one in all its appointments. His trade is not confined to Roanoke and immediate vicinity, but extends over a wide territory, embracing points in the Shenandoah Valley, and throughout Southwest Virginia and the West Virginia coal fields. A high-grade tailoring establishment is an adjunct to the general furnishing and haberdashery business and is patronized by many local, as well as out-of-town customers. Mr. Payne has invested largely in Roanoke real estate and has erected a number of handsome residences in various parts of the city. He also owns valuable business property in the heart of the city. He is a member of the Chamber of Commerce, the Retail Merchant's Association, and is a director of the City National Bank. He has been prominently identified with projects for the advancement of the city's interests, and is regarded as one of Roanoke's most enterprising and substantial business men. He is essentially a self-made man, and the eminent success which he has achieved in his business career, is due to untiring energy, close application, and careful study of the wishes and requirements of his trade.

Ten years ago he established a wholesale fruit and produce business trading under the firm name of The Fitch Fruit Company with offices and large warerooms at 208 Market Square. Mr. Fitch handles everything in the fruit and produce line. He purchases in carload lots and is therefore enabled to quote closer prices than the small dealer. He is a pioneer in the wholesale fruit business and it was through his energy and perseverance that Roanoke has become a large distributing point covering generous fields in Southwest Virginia and West Virginia. Mr. Fitch is a progressive wide-awake citizen and is loyal at all times to the best interests of this city and section. HARRY BANNISTER The subject of this notice, Dr. Harry Bannister, was born in England, forty-five years ago, and came to the United States when a small boy, in the year 1869, and located in Philadelphia, where he was educated in the schools of that city. He is a son of Mr. and Mrs. James Bannister and graduated in Veterinary Medicine from the University of Pennsylvania, in 1890, with the degree of V. M. D.

He has made hosts of friends during his sojourn in Roanoke. Fraternally he is an Elk and Odd Fellow and religiously a Quaker. In 1891 he was married to Ida M. Stump, daughter of C.

WILLIAM BERNARD BATES William Bernard Bates, the subject of this sketch, was born in Richmond, Virginia, November 19th, 1879, and is a son of Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Edward Bates. His father was First Assistant City Engineer of Richmond, Virginia, and he held that position consecutively for forty-two years. His grandfather, Mr. Micagor Bates, was the first Surveyor and Civil Engineer of Richmond and the original map, showing the general layout of Richmond was made by him, and is now being used with the official records of that city. William Bernard Bates was attending the Virginia Polytechnic Institute in 1901, at the time of his father's death, and he was forced to leave college and enter upon his career as a Civil Engineer without completing his college course. Prior to entering college, however, he was on the surveying corps for a railroad in West Virginia, with a party of fifteen and spent eight months in the wilds of that State. In 1898, when the survey was completed (Mr. Bates was then a boy of eighteen years of age), he rode his chief's horse home, a distance of one hundred and fifty-five miles, in three days. He was accompanied on the trip by Colonel Jones, who during the Civil War was a Courier for General Robert E. Lee. The route was across the mountains dividing Virginia and West Virginia and through the Shenandoah Valley. From 1901 to 1904 Mr. Bates was Assistant Engineer and Engineer of Maintenance of Way of the Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac Railroad, during the construction of double tracks between Richmond and History of Roanoke City—Biographical Washington. A part of the double tracking was under the supervision of Mr. Bates, and the work was completed to the entire satisfaction of the Chief Engineer and officials of the railroad. In 1904 he resigned his position with the railroad company and accepted the position of Assistant City Engineer of Richmond. This position he held for about one year. He came to Roanoke in 1905 and was elected City Engineer of this city continuously until 1909. The entire bond issue of 1904 of $800,000, was expended during his term of office, which embraced improvements in the business section of the city, and streets in the residential section. During this period the Campbell Avenue, Lick Run drains were put in and the work is of a permanent nature, made so by reönforced concrete. Many reforms were inaugurated in the City Engineer's Office, which enabled the public to be advised of the expenditures over which he had control and to which they were justly entitled. The sanitary conditions of the city were greatly improved by the construction of sewers and drains covering as much territory as had been previously constructed prior to his administration. During the past two and one-half years he has been in architectural work, engineering, and superintending the construction of buildings. He is junior member of the firm of Huggins &amp; Bates, with well equipped offices in the Strickland Building. His firm has recently prepared the plans for the following buildings: County Courthouse at Salem, Virginia; County Courthouse at Christiansburg, Virginia; County Courthouse at Rocky Mount, Virginia; Courthouse at Fitzgerald, Georgia; The New Masonic Temple Building, Roanoke, Virginia; Gainsborough Apartment House and Jefferson Apartment House, Roanoke, Virginia; Building for the American Bank and Trust Company, Petersburg, Virginia; The A. Rosenstock Company's Building, Petersburg, Virginia; Asbury Methodist Episcopal Church, South Richmond, Virginia; Bryan Building, Richmond, Virginia, and Strickland Building, Roanoke, Virginia. The firm of Huggins &amp; Bates have prepared the plans and specifications of a majority of the business blocks and handsome residences of this city, but their business is by no means of a local nature. In November, 1906, Mr. Bates married S. Jane Pollard, daughter of Hon. H. P. Pollard, City Attorney of Richmond, Virginia. They have one daughter, Harriett Gresham Bates. Fraternally he is a member of the Masons and Knights of Pythias. Religiously he is a member of the Fourth Avenue Christian Church.

He was honored with the appointment of Postmaster at Roanoke by President Roosevelt on June 27th, 1906, and for four years made such a splendid record in the conduct of the office, both in the interests of the public and the Post Office Department, that he was reappointed for a second term of four years by President Taft on February 1st, 1911. During his incumbency many improvements have been inaugurated by him which have made the service the most up to date in the country.

Stewart &amp; Company, furniture dealers and with the exception of one year, while he was in Ohio at school, Mr. Boone remained with this firm for a period of fourteen years. In December, 1891, the concern was incorporated under the firm name of the E. H. Stewart Furniture Company with Mr. Boone as Vice President and General Manager. In 1898 the firm of Lowe &amp; Boone was established and successfully operated for five years, after which time Mr. Boone associated himself with Overstreet &amp; Thurman under the firm name of Overstreet, Thurman &amp; Boone, and later when Mr. Overstreet retired from the business, the firm name was changed to Thurman &amp; Boone Company, Incorporated, of which he is the first Vice President and Sales Manager.

HARRY BIGLER DONALDSON Harry Bigler Donaldson, the subject of this sketch, has represented the city of Roanoke in the Council and on the Board of Aldermen successively for fourteen years, having been elected as a member of the old Council from the old Fourth Ward in 1897. This position he held until under the new constitution the Bicameral Council became effective when he was elected, for a short term, as a member of the Board of Aldermen. This was in 1904 and in 1906 he was again elected from Jefferson Ward for a term of four years. In 1910 he was elected to the Board for a third term. During the fourteen years of service in the Council he has been on every committee but one, and has served as Chairman of the Committees on "Fire and Water," "Streets," and "Public Property." He has been Chairman of the Public Property Committee for six years. He was born in Smithsburg, Maryland, February 22d, 1867, and is a son of William O. and Adelaide (Wishard) Donaldson. When quite young he graduated from the Smithsburg High School, under the tutorship of Professor George C. Pearson. After graduation he taught in the public schools of Washington County, Maryland, for a period of five years. During Cleveland's Administration he was Assistant Postmaster under his father at Smithsburg. In May, 1891, he located in Roanoke, Virginia, and accepted a position in the copper shop of the Roanoke Machine Works, where he has since remained. Religiously Mr. Donaldson is a member of St. Mark's Lutheran Church. Socially he is an Elk, a member of Lakeland Lodge of Masons, an Odd Fellow, and a Red Man.

Hurst of Roanoke, Virginia; Esther and Harry B., Jr. History of Roanoke City—Biographical WILLIAM LANDES SHAFER Several years ago one of Horace Greeley's ambitious young followers meditated over that famous journalist's laconic dictum, "Young man, go West!" This young newspaper man found that conditions had changed greatly since Greeley's time, and, instead of following that go-west advice, he said to himself, "Young man, you go South!" He did come South—to Roanoke— and he hasn't been sorry a single moment. Nor have the people of this vicinity regretted his decision, if the volume of support for his pleadings for advancement of the community may be a criterion. William Landes Shafer, the young man referred to, had come South before he came here to live, had seen enough when he came to Virginia courting and marrying to impress him with the patent fact that the South, and especially the Roanoke district, means "opportunity." His marrying Bennie Lee Nininger, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. B. F. Nininger, of Daleville, Botetourt County, Virginia, may have had some influence in his final decision to become a southerner, but back of that was his unbounded faith in Dixie's future. His printed or spoken expressions are candid heart-beats of the things that he believes about the city and state he loves. Mr. Shafer was reared a farmer boy in the Miami Valley of Ohio, that magnificent section of the highest class farms and roads; and no sooner had he come to Virginia to live than he began preaching good roads and more intensive farming, results of which preachments are in evidence, including the National Highway, for which, at first, he fought lone-handed, and the present orchard development. He came to Virginia to be Editor of the Roanoke Evening World, for which he had been fitted by education in the Ohio public schools and at Juniata College, Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, from which he was graduated in 1900; by a thorough experience in printing office work, and, best of all, by eight years of service in all departments of daily newspaper work at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The latter experience in one of the greatest industrial centers of the world also fitted him admirably for the industrial expansion duties that devolved upon him when he became Secretary of the Roanoke Chamber of Commerce in May, 1910. While he was in newspaper work he had been a member of the Chamber and had worked personally or editorially for civic, commercial, and industrial betterment for the Roanoke community. The Magic City's now widely heralded slogan, "Acorn to Oak—Watch Roanoke!" was the result of a contest which he fathered and conducted. The new Secretary completed his first year with a splendid record to the credit of himself and the Cham-ber—new enterprises established, better roads, and streets secured, a more hearty civic spirit and loyalty instilled in the Roanoke people and the membership roll of the organization increased from one hundred and fifty-five to more than five hundred boosters and builders of the better and bigger city and district that is resulting every day. He served as director of the American Association of Commercial Executives for 1910-11 and was chosen a Vice President of the Southern Commercial Secretaries' Association for 1911-12. He is regarded as a civic engineer of the first rank and has turned a deaf ear to offers in other states, because he came to Virginia to make good for Roanoke—and he's going to do it. GEORGE L. HART The subject of this sketch was born in Corning, New York, February 23d, 1874, but moved to the town of Big Lick (now city of Roanoke) in 1876, his father, Dr. H. C. Hart, during that year establishing the Roanoke Valley Health Institute in that town. Mr. Hart received his education in the public schools of Roanoke, supplemented, after he accepted employment, by private instruction evenings.

Roberts in the livery business under the firm name of Horton &amp; Roberts, and he, himself, engaged in the real estate business. He invested largely and when the depression and panic came in 1893, like others, he went to the wall. For the second time he gave his attention to the livery business, but never lost confidence in Roanoke's future. He purchased the business of W. C. Williams and began supplying livery service for the summer resorts of Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina. He prospered, and after paying his "boom" obligations his surplus money was again invested in Roanoke real estate. His investments were judicious and to-day he owns some fine inside business property, both improved and unimproved, including the Horton Building adjoining the Post Office. His beautiful home, "Nestlebrooke," comprises a valuable one hundred and seventy-five acre farm situated in the northwestern part of Roanoke and within the city limits, being one of the most valuable tracts of land in the country.

HENRY COOPER BARNES Any Roanoke publication treating of the business men (the makers of Roanoke) would be incomplete History of Roanoke City—Biographical without the name of Henry Cooper Barnes, one of its most popular citizens. No business man is a more firm believer in advertising than Mr. Barnes, who, since he embarked in business, has kept it constantly before the people, has not only made his business surpass all records in prosperity, but the means of bringing about general advertising, that has accrued greatly to the benefit of the city. Henry Cooper Barnes was born near Camden, South Carolina, December 12th, 1859. His parents were George W. and Sarah J. (Cook) Barnes. He is the eldest of sixteen children. His boyhood days were mostly spent on his father's farm, and attending school. In January, 1879, he went to Greenville, South Carolina, where he secured a position and learned the drug business. He became registered in South Carolina, and afterwards held positions in Columbia and Charleston, South Carolina, Dallas, Texas, and Baltimore, Maryland. While located in the latter city, he was induced to take a position with Budwell &amp; Christian, of Roanoke, coming here in October, 1888. In 1891 he severed his connection with the above firm, and organized the drug business of Haller &amp; Barnes. A year later he bought the interest of his partner at the corner of Jefferson Street and Norfolk Avenue, and operated the store alone, as "H. C. Barnes. He puts up Prescriptions." Having now had considerable experience, and having the confidence of the public, he applied himself closely to his chosen work and his business soon began to prosper. He advertised extensively, studied the needs and wants of the public, and laid the foundation for a permanent business. In 1900 he opened a branch store at No. 32 Salem Avenue, which was later extended through to Campbell Avenue, and incorporated as the "Barnes Drug Company." In the early part of 1906 he sold his entire interest in that store, and in June of the same year, incorporated his individual business on Jefferson Street, opposite the passenger depot, under the firm name of "H. C. Barnes, Incorporated," with a paid in capital of $25,000, of which he is President and Treasurer, T. J. Rice, Vice President, and R. K. Rector, Secretary. The Company is one of the leading mercantile establishments of its kind in the city.

Mr. Barnes is a member of the American Pharmaceutical Association and of the Virginia Pharmaceutical Association, being Chairman of the Executive Committee, of the last named organization. Mr. Barnes is also largely interested in Roanoke real estate, and has been eminently successful in buying and selling inside business and residence property. In 1900 he bought the Welch Home, overlooking the Roanoke River, where he has since resided. His faith in that section of the city being so strong, he continued to buy up all the adjacent tracts and lots obtainable, until his holdings were considerable in acres. Improvements were made and to-day the property is in great demand. It is known as the "Barnes Addition," and is the cream of residential property in the great Southwest section. Over twenty thousand dollars worth of lots were sold from this addition during three months in 1911. He is one of the owners of the Wasena Land Company, being its Vice President, and is a director of the City National Bank. On February 14th, 1894, he married Miss Virginia F.

The business is conducted to-day by the four brothers, James, Fergus, Charles H. B., and David. They believe in the future of Roanoke and have invested largely of their surplus cash in good business property.

He resigned his position and went with the Roanoke Railway and Electric Company and remained with that corporation until 1895, when he was elected Clerk of the City Market. Mr. Coleman has been continuously reölected ever since, and this alone demonstrates that he is the right man for the place and that he has faithfully discharged every duty imposed by the office. He was married in 1895, to Miss Sallie B. Huffman, a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Edward Huffman, of Harrisonburg, Virginia. As a result of that union they have a little daughter, Thurna Vivian, aged ten years.

When a small boy his parents moved to Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, where he graduated from the high school and embarked in business at the age of sixteen years. For a short period he was employed in the Post Office at Chambersburg, and came to Roanoke, Virginia, in April, 1888, and accepted a position in the motive power department of the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Company. He was promoted several times and within a period of three years was made Chief Clerk to the Superintendent. He resigned in 1895 to accept the position of Secretary to D. W.

In the summer of the same year he became identified with the Iron Belt Building and Loan Association and a few months later was made Secretary and Manager, which position he retained until January 1st, 1902. This was one of the largest concerns of its kind in the South and on January the second, 1902, he was named by the United States Court, as one of the receivers of the Association and acted in that capacity, until the affairs of the company had been wound up. In the spring of 1904, Mr. Jacobs, organized the Roanoke Chamber of Commerce and was Secretary of same until 1910. For a period of six years, as Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, his services to the city can hardly be estimated. He kept abreast of the times, was always keenly alive to the situation, and it was largely through his untiring efforts that Roanoke became prominent in the field of industrial endeavor. In 1904 Mr. Jacobs was elected to the City Council from Highland Ward and served a term of four years. For two years he was Chairman of the Ordinance and Street committees and was prominently identified with floating the bond issue of 1905, which led to extensive public improvements throughout the city. As Chairman of the Street Committee, he gave his personal attention to street improvements, at this time, about $400,000 was spent for the above-named purpose. He was largely instrumental in having the splendid school building near Highland Park erected. By resolution of Mr. Jacobs, the Gish Tract, a large body of land owned by the city, was dedicated and designated as Highland Park. He was unanimously elected President of the City Council in 1906, and for two years his administration was marked by a high order of executive ability. Since 1910 Mr. Jacobs has been engaged in the business of Public Accountant and has a large clientele in this city and throughout Southwest Virginia and West Virginia. In 1902 he was married to Nellie M. Gardner, daughter of Charles F. and Laura Gardner, of Christiansburg, Virginia, and as a result of that union they have four children; namely, Kathleen, Edward Boyle, Elinor and Charles Cleveland.
