      <field name="fulltext">Fourteenth Annual Report on Historical Collections, University of Virginia Library, For the Year 1943-44 WHEN an institution preserves historical records according to plan, we generally assume that they will be used sooner or later in research. Their usefulness depends to a large degree, of course, upon their accessibility. However slightly some custodians may feel their responsibility on this score, certain rudimentary controls and procedures can be established without great difficulty. The system need not be complicated—in fact, experience in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Division of the University of Virginia Library has shown that simplicity of arrangement, along with observance of a few sound archival principles, makes the records available in good order with a minimum of delay.1 1. Thirteenth Annual Report on Historical Collections, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1942-43 (University, Va., 1943), pages 1-14. Once the records are within the walls of the library, they are readily susceptible to some control; but what is to be said about "system" and "control" while they are still outside? "That reminds me of a story" is the most ready answer to this question, for the ups and downs, the hither and yon of collecting historical materials yield more unique "incidents" than general principles. We might borrow a title from the sociologists who borrowed it from the natural scientists, and call this essay "How Field Work is Carried on," but that phrase is almost too scientific for a treasure hunt, to overstate the case for emphasis. Although historians and their associates have been engaged in this pursuit since ancient times, no formal methodology has evolved to become generally recognized and accepted. While their concern with such problems as provenance and chronology reaches back to the very origin of one document or another, its course through numerous hands to the final place of deposit often cannot be charted with certainty. If this is true of official records of governments, it is even more so with regard to personal papers or other materials in private hands. Thus in the game of collecting, most of the rules are outweighed by exceptions. How men, and especially women, will react about their historical papers under certain circumstances is both predictable and unpredictable. From his experience the collector develops and modifies his plan of action; but he must be prepared to scrap it for the sake of expediency. And so, while his purpose is definite, his method is highly empirical, his main precept—"Go, travel the road yourself." For purposes of research, collecting is done by individuals engaged in their own studies and by institutions through their agents. It is with the latter that we are concerned here. The problems of operating in an almost limitless field may be classified under two headings: first, those involved in the relations between the institution and the primary sources of supply, viz. the owners of the materials; second, those involved in relations among collectors in the same field, both persons and institutions, whether in cooperation or, more frequently, in competition. This essay will be restricted to the first of these because it is logically first and deserves careful consideration. Furthermore, an institution's policies and practices in the first instance have a direct bearing upon what it does in the second. There is much to be said for adopting a broad general basis for collecting historical materials, without limitation as to date or subject matter. Geographical limitations, however, in terms of the state or region in the United States are sound for both historical and practical reasons. A general program, such as the University of Virginia's, covering mainly the area of Virginia from colonial days to the present, need draw no artificial distinctions as to types of records produced in this area, although some selection should be made from those available, in terms of historical value. Church and business records may be found in the same collection. A project devoted to the sources of business history might reject the religious materials in its zeal for the economic and in so doing overlook certain significant inter-relationships which the collection would reveal in its entirety. The validity of the social historian's concept of history as all inclusive is well substantiated when it is applied to the collection of materials by the research institution. It aids the individual investigator by serving the interests of scholarship in general and it best assures the preservation of organic bodies of papers intact, with proper regard for their internal organization. Although our research libraries are more and more effective in providing the individual historian with basic materials, he is a short-sighted scholar who does not inquire into those sources of his subject still in private hands. But he becomes a menace to the institutions that serve him when he goes beyond his note-taking and persuades the owners to dispose of choice segments of their papers merely for his personal satisfaction. The best corrective is increasing institutional activity, along with an appeal for cooperation from both owners and users of such material. In view of the intensified collecting activity by numerous institutions during the past two decades the question is occasionally raised, "Are there many historical records left to be gathered?" Considering the fact that history and its records are continuously in the making, this may seem to be a foolish question, but anyone involved in the work of collecting learns that he must take into account the commonly accepted meaning of history as memorable events and records of the more distant past, and that in the South especially, the year 1865 is still widely regarded as the end of the historical past. But even if one were to accept such a limited view of historical processes, the answer to this query would still be in the affirmative. Records in private possession are widely dispersed. Man's indifference and wilful destruction, fires and floods, and other elements reduce the volume of records willy-nilly year after year, and wars usually bring more widespread destruction in their wake. Nevertheless, in spite of these hazards, many imprints and manuscripts survive. Migration of population, its concentration in cities, and the transformation of agricultural into industrial regions hasten the destruction of older materials while new records are simultaneously created. The dominant rural character of Virginia life throughout the history of the colony and state has undoubtedly served to safeguard numerous private records untouched for generations. Personal traits also enter into consideration. Where life goes on at the same easy pace for long periods, the inclination to let things accumulate becomes a habit and the forces of nature seem to be the only active agent of destruction. As the abandoned tobacco shed in Virgnia, instead of being torn down, leans to leeward until it eventually meets the earth, so many a collection of family papers has grown by slow accretion, layer upon layer, in old trunks under the eaves or in outhouses, until in the course of time it is by chance rescued for careful preservation or destroyed. Because of the present-day historian's broad interpretation of what is historical, the supply of the raw materials of history is greater than what would have been estimated a generation ago, and the continual discovery of such materials is proof that the mine is not worked out. How are they found and where does the search begin? Does the collector know what he is looking for? Is some reasoning required in the quest or is it mainly a matter of chance? What method worthy of the name is preferred? Let us make a few warranted assumptions at the start to simplify the procedure that is suggested. Within a geographical area of operations the collector of historical materials as the agent of a research library should take that world as his parish. (Incidentally, he may find himself becoming a sort of historical missionary as he sees and hears directly how our knowledge of the past is thwarted by those who neglect the sources in their custody.) He should be familiar with the history of the region, not only to evaluate with expert judgment what he finds but also to probe for what theoretically should be discovered in a certain place. He will set up no artificial barriers as to date or subject matter nor show any unfounded preference for manuscript over printed material. The work of the past eight years in early American imprints throughout the nation, inspired by the late Douglas C. McMurtrie, has developed a new appreciation of these sources and their intimate relation to manuscript records in many instances. On the trail the collector must develop a new sense of time, accommodated always to the quest and the quarry, and least to his own convenience. "White collar" hours from nine to five will have to be abandoned for a more flexible working day usually off schedule. There may be time for lunch but often there is no lunch available. The white collar will soon turn grey and be discarded for another with a more serviceable color. Only figuratively speaking can this sleuth have clean hands. Dust, dirt, and vermin he must be prepared to face. He may even welcome the dust and dirt on occasion, with the expectation that the depth of the covering may bear a direct relation to the age of the papers and their satisfactory condition in the original order of arrangement. As for vermin, even here some distinction may be drawn. I recall a newspaper publisher in northern Virginia who encouraged some mice to make their abode in his storeroom by enticing them with a pot of glue that suited their taste. My long afternoon's work among the papers was considerably eased by the capers of those mice, young and old, completely unconcerned about my presence. And perhaps the superior flavor of the glue served to safeguard the newspapers from attack. From these rather general comments on preparation for the search for historical materials we may turn to some specific matters regarding physical equipment and financial resources. A list of the former need be no longer than that of James H. Breasted during his first field work in Egypt in the latter 1890's. Years afterward he recalled how he "rode up and stood for the first time under the shadow of the vast temple of Medinet Habu opposite Luxor—a building with its enormous wall-surfaces covered with uncopied and unstudied historical records. . . . An inventory of my equipment for meeting this situation was as follows: transportation 1 donkey on hire for the day, browsing near by; stationery 1 pocket note-book; photography 1 tiny Kodak hand-camera; supplies 1 basket lunch and 2 bottles of water; time three-quarters of a day; family resources 1 wife newly acquired, also browing near by."2 2. James H. Breasted, "The New Crusade," American Historical Review, XXXIV, no. 2 (January, 1929), page 221. Our modern equipment would include one light motorcar with good mileage per gallon of gasoline and ample space to carry the materials acquired; a note-book, or preferably note cards for convenience of filling; a Leica camera for microfilming; supplies consisting of old clothes or coveralls, gauze to protect the lungs from dust, and a minimum of food and drink in this land of roadside lunch counters and Coca-Cola stands; and time enough to travel far from the home base and concentrate upon the work in the selected locality. The wife, if newly acquired, will doubtless enjoy "browsing near by"—but she may prefer the comforts of home after such trips have ceased to be a novelty. The cost of this kind of travel is relatively high. Railroad or bus transportation is impracticable for most of these journeys; the automobile alone has made such work possible on a comprehensive scale. An allowance of $1,000 per year for travel would be a bare minimum for intermittent trips, on a basis of five cents per mile (whch is not adequate to cover depreciation and overhead on the car) plus food and lodging. An allowance of $1,500 to $2,000 would produce better results by providing a margin for extra or emergency travel, when the opportunity to acquire important material suddenly appears and action must not be delayed. When funds are meager, trips must be limited in time and distance; yet a long trip will often prove to be more economical in its net results. Something is gained in the low rates of board and room in rural areas and in the ability of the collector to live both economically and comfortably within his resources. I am writing, of course, in terms of prewar conditions. Within a decade these remarks may have become only a curious record of a bygone age. Among the equipment mentioned above is a notebook. Memoranda will be recorded during the expedition, but it is not a blank book when the journey begins. The intelligent collector has prepared the way somewhat by advanced information about his destination. He consults printed historical and descriptive accounts of the town or county for data concerning its notable persons and families, institutions and organizations, leading events and activities. Notes jotted down from these printed works provide the first step toward a goal clearly defined or only vaguely surmised. Correspondence with certain individuals in the community may supply additional leads, including the exact whereabouts of valuable books and papers. Thus evidence is accumulated and clues are found to prepare the way for actual investigation in the locality. Some previous knowledge of kinships may be helpful in negotiating for personal and family manuscripts. Since the economic and social life of a community may have changed radically within two or three generations, present-day conditions are likely to be misleading with regard to valuable records of the past worth searching for. Thus the collector approaches the scene of his labor with a small portion of specific information, a generous amount of speculation about what will be revealed, and a healthy skepticism concerning some of his early clues. Among the prerequisites for writing sound and illuminating history is an understanding of human nature. The collector of materials must possess this quality too, or develop it steadily as he makes his way about the locality. If he lacks an introduction to any particular person, he can doubtless secure valuable preliminary advice from the clerk of the local court, the newspaper editor, or an old-time lawyer frequenting the court house. Assistance will be forthcoming from some residents because of their interest in historical matters, from others because of ties with the institution which the collector represents. Already he begins to get a glimpse of the community from the inside as he becomes the recipient of their hospitality. He will learn to say grace before meat without surprise or trepidation and to adapt his share of the conversation to subjects of local interest. His education will be advanced more rapidly by engaging a room with a private family than by staying at a hotel. Some of these acquaintanceships will ripen into enduring friendships. As old travel routes are crossed and recrossed by new ones in subsequent years, these friends can always be relied upon for their continuing interest and assistance. To the collector temporarily residing in the community come new bits of information, substantiating or contradicting earlier ones and providing clues to other materials hitherto unknown to him. He will find most owners of materials quite willing to show him what they have. Some of the clues, of course, have been based only upon rumor and so come to naught, but even those founded on "fact" may produce some disappointment merely because of differences in terminology. Although "historical papers" may mean manuscripts to the historian, they may designate printed materials in various forms to the layman. The latter often fails to distinguish between written (or published) history and the raw materials basic for historical writing. The historian as collector must frequently define his terms. Yet he may find it desirable to be vague or all inclusive in his language when he does not know what the owner has in his possession. If it is books and pamphlets of historical value, the collector would regret to have expressed an interest only in old letters and account books. Most clues, however, have some factual basis, and the anticipated thrill of uncovering historical treasures long forgotten or unappreciated is not infrequently heightened by the richness of the content. Indeed, the thrill may be all the greater by discovering entirely unknown sources. A personal experience in Halifax County, Virginia, a decade ago will illustrate this point. Word had reached me indirectly that a large mercantile firm had been in operation at the county seat for many years before the Civil War, carrying on an extensive business with the planters of the surrounding countryside. Easley &amp; Willingham was the firm and the Easley Family was still in residence. The grandson of the merchant-planter received me hospitably. When I explained the purpose of my call, he assured me that there were still some old ledgers in an outhouse near by. As he swung open the door of the frame shed, the dim light disclosed a grey-brown mass of books in deep disorderly piles. Eagerly I picked up one, then another, and opened them at random. They were the store accounts for the period reported. But before the examination had proceeded very far, another type of record was uncovered. Here were accounts of land warrants in Illinois and Missouri along with letters received from agents in Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska, and neighboring states on land transactions in the 1850's and especially during the quarter century after the Civil War. This collection of over 100 volumes and numerous loose documents, after being inventoried, revealed in unusual detail how profits in country merchandising had been invested in western lands before 1860 and disposed of through agents on a commission basis during the latter phases of the westward movement.3 3. Fourth Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1933-34 (University, Va., 1934), page 5; Eighth Annual Report . . . 1937-38 (1938), page 28. Prof. Paul W. Gates, whose research on the disposal of the public lands is well known, has called the Easley Papers one of the finest collections on this subject. It was coincidental that about three weeks after these papers had been removed to the University of Virginia Library, Dr. Gates was trying to locate them from information he had found in the Land Office records in Washington. His trail through Virginia ended in Charlottesville. In meeting the owner of historical materials face to face, the collector needs to sense or detect the former's viewpoint and opinion regarding them in order to develop the conversation tactically to the best advantage. Most owners have come into possession of their materials more or less by accident, by inheritance or by discovery of an accumulation of papers long since forgotten or abandoned. Owners of collections assembled because of special personal interests are relatively few. They are not likely to be moved by an appeal from an institution, except under circumstances that touch them in some peculiar way. They "speak the language" of the professional and should be encouraged to continue on their own, for the ultimate benefit of some appropriate research institution. In considering further the owner who discovers the historical materials in his possession quite by chance, it is well to note that he is usually not devoid of definite opinions about them. Although in law or medicine he would defer to the specialist, he will hardly be expected to have such an attitude toward the historian and so withhold judgment on historical sources. Let us consider some of these prevailing attitudes and the collector's problems deriving from them. Taking for granted certain natural and accidental forces of destruction over which little control can be established, we may say that the collector is continually running a race against ignorance of historical values in relation to records. The owner who does not know that such values exist may save a few imprints or manuscripts from those at hand as curiosities; his indifference may accidentally result in his ignoring all of the papers until he becomes enlightened. Yet in many instances the collector arrives too late. To him the loss sometimes seems more of a disappointment when he has missed saving them by a narrow margin of time. To him the person who lets his papers accumulate by steady accretion throughout the years is a man after his own heart, because they may be found untouched in their original condition. At the opposite pole is the person whose best intentions are concerned with clearing out all so-called "trash," as determined by his sole judgment, or lack of it. Under these circumstances housecleaning becomes a grave meance and spring is the worst time of year. In passing judgment on materials in his possession, many a person supposes that only those pertaining to historic persons and events are really historical. Although papers of this kind always have a certain pre-eminence because of their association value as well as their content, our written history would be narrowly limited if based only upon records of the famous and the unusual. Historians of the twentieth century have sought increasingly for information revealing the "norm" or the "average" in any period, on all aspects of society, through a variety of individuals and institutions. This is the viewpoint of the social historian who strives to recapture the past in its entirety. He maintains that famous men and events must be judged in the light of their times and the exceptional appraised in relative terms. Thus the records of the unimportant person, unknown beyond his immediate locality—records by and about the common man—may have historical importance. This is well illustrated by the change in availability and use of agricultural sources on the ante bellum South. Prof. Ulrich B. Phillips's research during the first quarter of the present century was done mainly in the records of large plantations of which numerous collections had been preserved and made accessible. Today more attention is given by scholars to the small farm and its relation to the plantation, as depicted through writings of obscure men and through official census and tax records of the whole population or of a considerable proportion thereof. It is clear, therefore, that the collector of historical materials needs to convince the owner of the broad meaning of the word "historical." The owner may have to be persuaded on several other related points also. Why, he asks, should his papers be of interest to anyone else, or certainly to anyone outside his family? They are purely "personal papers" and could not have any research value. He remarks casually that he has given a few items to friends and relatives as curiosities because their forebears were mentioned in the content. Some of the records are of such recent date—perhaps of fifty years ago—that they are surely not historical, are they? Well, the task of enlightenment is somewhat easier if he asks the question. But the collector may find difficulty in convincing the owner that the historical past is not necessarily far removed from the present or that the personal element in letters is not a sound criterion for excluding them from a historical collection. At any rate, "personal" is so indeterminate in meaning that a clarification of terms may work to the mutual advantage of both parties in the disposal or retention of the papers. Some types of records have been especially neglected and destroyed for lack of historical appreciation. Materials of an economic nature were overlooked as long as the historian's interest was restricted to political and military events within a narrow framework of governmental acts and armies on the march. When the economic historian appeared, he found very few collections of sources on specific manufactures or individual firms, on merchandising enterprises, banks, or other businesses. These records, in the form of loose papers and account books, usually have least chance of survival because they are largely arithmetical and impersonal to the casual observer. Their historical use requires more explanation to the layman than a letter on politics. When the records of a business firm have been preserved intact, their bulk presents a serious problem to both owner and collector. Perhaps the records have survived because they were too massive for easy disposal until finally the space they occupied was urgently needed for other purposes. In these circumstances, if the collector comes along at the right time, he may have the records for the asking. However, he too has to reckon with the problem of space and safeguard his institution against any restrictions on accessioning the material whereby the bulk cannot be reduced for research purposes. Business records were the first to force archivists and other custodians to develop criteria of selection. In their selection and use the economic historian can apply certain research techniques developed scientifically by the economist; but the social historian urges the economic historian to seek additional sources beyond the organic records of business so that he will not repeat the earlier shortcomings of the political historian. In a predominantly rural region such as Virginia the most widely dispersed economic materials are the account books of the general country store. Although usually owned and operated by an individual or by partners, it was in a very real sense a local institution of great significance before the days of improved highways. Many a store was run by members of the same family for three or four generations in the same building. Ledgers, journals, and daybooks were accumulated steadily on the shelf behind the cash box and then removed to the garret by a sort of automatic process rather than for any conscious purpose of preservation. The more ancient and unkept the store building, the more imposing I have found its records to be. Not infrequently, when the storekeeper learned of their historical value, he took pleasure in giving them to the library for research purposes. It so happened that the collecting of such records during the past twenty years occurred at a critical time when the chain store forced many a country merchant to reorganize his business or dispose of it. The Southern Country Store, which Prof. Thomas D. Clark has so graphically described for the period 1865-1915 in his recent book with this sub-title,4 4. Pills, Petticoats and Plows: the Southern Country Store (Indianapolis and New York [1944]). is literally reborn from the records. He has made the old account books come to life in a fashion that should convince the most indifferent merchant of the historical value of his records. Other types of materials might be mentioned to illustrate further the advantage of a comprehensive program of collecting. Such a program does not set up artificial lines of demarcation between what ought to be accepted and rejected. Certainly the lines are often difficult to draw as to historical period and still more so as to subject matter; furthermore, this kind of discrimination vitiates research work when it breaks up collections or related papers and destroys their organic unity. This does not mean that the collector throws discretion to the winds and gathers up everything available in sight. He must be familiar with both the broad needs and the specific wants of his library, and develop intelligent discrimination in the course of his experience. His sense of values becomes considerably modified as more and more materials pass through his hands. He is half prepared for the unexpected to turn up and for the argument appropriate to the occasion to assure preservation, first by the owner, eventually by transfer to the library. Sometimes quick action is advisable while the owner is in a favorable mood—"while the iron is hot." I am reminded of my quest for a certain collection of manuscripts which I knew from authentic information were in an old residence near Lynchburg. Since the only sure access to the papers, I learned, was through the good offices of several relatives involved in the matter, the road to my destination was round-about through many counties, intermittently during the course of a year or more. With the proper groundwork laid, I enjoyed a cordial reception by the owner and was taken without much delay to the attic of the old farmhouse. A hasty glance convinced me that the contents, by their casual appearance and thick coating of dust, were an accumulation of many decades. The manuscripts in question were easily found in an old trunk and proved to be well worth the prolonged efforts to secure them. While we were making a cursory examination of them, I saw near by several piles of old newspapers. Knowing that the Library had no files of papers published in this vicinity, I suggested that they would be of service at the University. He was agreeable to the suggestion. When I repeated it with reference to a stack of magazines and pamphlets I also coveted, he acquiesced again, adding that I would make a good forager for an army. I am not sure he meant the remark as a compliment, although I passed it off as such. When I left for home my car was filled to capacity, with a greater variety of material than I had anticipated and perhaps with better results because they were accomplished at one time under most favorable circumstances. From whatever angle the subject of collecting historical materials is discussed, it is evident that personal factors play a large part. The owner's appreciation of or indifference towards his records, his mere sense of possession, family pride and loyalty, financial needs or desires—any one of these factors, if not a combination of them, may bear most weight in the conversations and final results. Patience is one of the greatest virtues of the collector. As we have seen, he may have many obstacles to surmount before a meeting of minds is effected. Proper timing is essential. Where a whole family is involved, several minds will have to be reconciled or the dominant will in the situation discovered. I still regret the loss of one collection because I became accidentally allied with the weaker faction against the stronger by being over-anxious before the time was ripe. With what proved to be insufficient authority to acquire the papers from the unoccupied country house, one load was secured when the blow fell. Some of the material was reclaimed by the opposition, but the old house burned some time afterward and the bulk of the records was undoubtedly destroyed. I wondered whether the family felt worse than I did. In the course of conversation that leads by devious indirection to the object of one's visit, I can testify that love, religion, and the weather are still universal subjects. In speaking of the South, where the art of conversation has survived our high-speed mechanized world, I would add a fourth subject—"the War." Certainly until the present world conflict "the War" required no identification. Records of 1861-65 still in private hands are numerous and events and incidents of those memorable years are perpetuated in folk lore as well as in history. It is inevitable that the quest for historical materials should lead to recollections of stories about Yankees and Confederates. As a northerner I have been impressed by the reality of that war which still prevails, and yet by the willingness to discuss the pros and cons without bitterness, except on the part of a few. The historian, in the course of his collecting for the institution he represents, finds much to stimulate his own research. He understands more fully than the armchair scholar where and how to look for the sources which have not yet come under library control. His first-hand knowledge of their variety and the conditions under which they have survived opens the way for the use of materials which may remain indefinitely in private hands. But in addition to these exceptional opportunities to develop expert knowledge and to apply it to original research in the records, there are certain intangible values that work to the same end. These derive from acquaintance with people in many walks of life—the descendants of the men and women whose records the historian seeks to preserve. His interpretation of those records is enhanced by a better understanding of ideas and ideals, of customs and philosophies of life which are inherited and expressed by the present generation in casual conversation, in opinions on current issues, and in subconscious reflections upon day by day personal and social relations. Although economic and social conditions in a region may have become vastly different in the course of a half century, the historian can recreate the living past more truly and realistically when he understands the living present and its relation to the past. Thus it may be said that the collector-historian's contacts with the sources reach beyond written records and historical objects into the realm of unwritten evidence. If he is aware of this opportunity, he ought to keep a diary or some kind of informal record of his experiences and impressions. I fear, however, that historians seldom produce primary sources of their own like those of previous generations they hope to find. You may protest that the collector is always asking for something. What does he have to offer in return, on behalf of his institution? It can be answered that, because he feels historical research to be an essential part of the advancement of learning, whereby the intellectual level and general welfare of society as a whole are improved, therefore he offers the facilities of his library for the care and preservation of materials which will increase the cultural resources of the state and nation. He may be frankly utilitarian about the whole matter; yet he can point out that the owner of materials has an opportunity to promote scholarship in a personal sort of way. If the latter already has direct ties with the institution, both the appeal and the personal satisfaction will be all the stronger. A collection of books and papers may serve as a lasting memorial to an individual or family whose deeds have been closely associated with the life and culture of the region; and the research library provides the most appropriate and effective means of carrying out this purpose. In numerous cases, papers accumulated through several generations cannot be rightfully claimed by any particular member of the family. The most obvious solution of the difficulty, which may have produced friction among the kinfolk, is to divide the papers into equal lots; but this is the worst possible solution, short of destruction, from the standpoint of their historical value. In such an impasse the collector may perform a real service by persuading all parties concerned jointly to transfer the materials to the custody of the library. Once their consent has been given, this end can easily be achieved, providing the collection has not been tampered with. If some division has already occurred, the task of reassembling it for preservation is generally long and arduous. The University of Virginia has a very interesting travel diary in four volumes which had been apportioned among four direct descendants of the diarist without alleviating the hard feelings in the family over an ownership which no one was justified in asserting. As the manuscript was well worth a special effort to secure, I found myself becoming the mediator among the members of the family. Diplomatic conversations, with gestures of good will conveyed by the emissary over the highways and byways of the Commonwealth of Virginia, finally brought agreement to the proposal that the University Library could provide the answer to the vexing question, To whom does the diary belong? Signatures were obtained and the four volumes at length reached what I hope is their permanent repository. In the transfer of materials from individual or joint ownership to the institution, several alternative proposals can be considered. The first is an outright gift to the institution; the second is deposit for safe-keeping and availabilty for use under terms whereby the depositor retains ownership and the right to withdraw the material. It is generally best to restrict the second possibility to manuscripts, since most imprints have to go through the expensive process of cataloguing in order to be made accessible, and this is inadvisable for material not the property of the library. The third alternative is temporary loan for photographing, or gift of the originals provided the donor is supplied with photographic copies. The fourth is purchase by the institution. In the course of its relations with donors and depositors the library may offer some repair services, information on relative values of certain items, and advice on the care of records retained by the owners. Although we have not been concerned primarily with sale and purchase of materials in the foregoing discussion, we would not deny that money talks with most effect under given conditions. I think, however, that it is important to draw a sharp line between what must be a financial transaction and what will be quite otherwise. It should not be too difficult to determine the attitude of the owner by the trend of his remarks. If the material must be purchased and it is worth having on that basis, let a fair price be agreed upon and the deal made. Surely the institution needs available funds for such situations. On the other hand, an offer to buy without knowledge of the owner's point of view reveals poor strategy. The personal element involved in many an individual's attitude toward the books and manuscripts belonging to his family preclude any thought of a money transaction. He may not appreciate their historical value, but at any rate he will not measure it in dollars and cents. Because historicial and association values are more subtle than monetary, the historian-collector is not trying to strike a bargain, but rather to cultivate an appreciation of what History is made of, in the records of Everyman, great and small. The results that accrue from an organized program of tracking down historical records to their source are slow in materializing at first, but after the third or fourth year the increase in returns becomes more noticeable. Although publicity in the press and by radio will be helpful, the work throughout the region begins to advertise itself by word of mouth and by voluntary support which a few local enthusiasts provide. Some persons bring their treasures to the library of their own accord. A large-scale correspondence will develop but it should supplement, not supplant, the work in the field. There is no adequate substitute for widespread personal contacts which, occasionally renewed, maintain local interest in the undertaking and open up new leads to historical resources in the community. Some of the fields of early efforts may lie fallow for years and then yield returns long after the initial work has been forgotten. The postwar period of twenty-five years ago witnessed notable expansion in the collection of historical and other research materials. Forecasts of another postwar era just ahead stress the complex problems already in the making. Historical records will provide much of the basis for the essential research that must be done. Our task of collecting them has just begun. Lester J. Cappon Consultant in History and Archives 1 July 1944</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EXPLANATORY NOTES Each entry describes the papers of a single acquisition, all the manuscripts in such a group being usually the papers of the single individual or family whose name is given. The word "records" is added in the case of the papers of an organization, and "collection" for groups of manuscripts assembled by a collector from various sources. Birth and death dates of persons are given in parentheses following the name. Dates not in parentheses indicate inclusive years of the manuscripts, with an occasional added date in parentheses to show the period covered by the bulk of the material. Thus 1725 (1900)-1928 means that while the earliest manuscript is dated 1725, the majority of papers fall in the period after 1900; 1805-(1850)1910 means that the body of the material ends in 1850, with a few scattered items up to 1910; and 1791 (1840-1860) 1902 means that the bulk of the papers fall between 1840 and 1860. The first ten issues of the Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library . . . are referred to, after the first citation as Archivist Report. In 1941 the series was renamed, for various reasons, the Annual Report on Historical Collections, University of Virginia Library. The usual abbreviations, "MS" for manuscript, "ALS" for autograph letters signed, etc., have been used. The numbers given at the end of each entry are accession numbers, included for their convenience as a finding aid in the Library. The names of depositors of manuscripts on loan to the University are not included; it should be understood that while the majority of such manuscripts are accessible for research, all are subject to such restrictions as the depositor has made, and none may be reproduced without consent of the owner. It will be noted that the present Annual Report covers only ten months, from 1 September 1943 to 30 June 1944, so that subsequent reports will coincide with the fiscal year of the Alderman Library, July through June.</field>

This interesting and valuable collection comprises the last large group of Jefferson papers known to have been still in private hands. It includes 64 letters from Jefferson and 375 to him, relating to family and business affairs. Many of them are from his children or grandchildren, written to Jefferson during the years that his public career kept him away from Monticello. Another small but significant group of letters are to Martha Jefferson from her school-girl friends, written while she was a student in a French convent and shortly after her return to America. Another group of ca. 50 letters from John Barnes to Jefferson is especially revealing of Jefferson's financial affairs. In addition to these Jefferson items, a large and important group of Wilson Cary Nicholas's letters are included. Especially noteworthy are a series of 25 letters, 1806-1808, from John Taylor of Caroline to Governor Nicholas, discussing politics and affairs of the day. There is likewise an extensive correspondence with Henry Lee over Nicholas's complicated personal finances and land titles. From the year 1820 the bulk of the collection is formed by the extensive correspondence of Jane Nicholas and Thomas Jefferson Randolph with their sisters and children. It reveals the intimate family life and financial troubles that pursued the Randolph, Nicholas, Eppes, Smith, and related families down to the Civil War. There is also a group of letters from George Wythe Randolph, Secretary of War of the Confederacy, which contains, in addition to family affairs, copies of his correspondence with Jefferson Davis and other Confederate leaders. Correspondents include: John Adams, Charles L. Bankhead, James Breckenridge, James Brown, Dabney Smith Carr, Peter Carr, Sidney Nicholas Carr, Charles Carroll, Jane Cary, Charles Clay, Henry Clay, William Cobbett, Ellen Coolidge, Joseph Coolidge, Tench Coxe, James Currie, Andrew Donald, Francis Eppes, John Wayles Eppes, Maria Jefferson Eppes, Edward Everett, Joseph Fry, Albert Gallatin, Eldridge Gerry, George Gilmer, Burgess Griffen, Alexander Hamilton, Richard Hanson, John Harvie, Jacob Hollingsworth, David Hylton, Thaddeus Kosciuszko, Marquis de Lafayette, Richard Henry Lee, Nicholas Lewis, James Lyle, James Madison, James Maury, Philip Mazzei, Bishop R.

The earliest papers are largely legal in nature and include manuscript maps and drawings, land patents and deeds, indentures, bills of sale, receipts, and accounts relating to the Sabine Hall Estate in Richmond County, Va. Early eighteenth century material includes personal and family letters on births, marriages, and deaths, and such plantation accounts as tobacco sales, wheat thrashing, wine making, purchase and sale of slaves, collection of quit rents, corn shucking, shipping difficulties, garden vegetables, and the health of the family and friends. From the year 1765 the papers take on an increasingly political aspect. Landon Carter was deeply concerned with governmental changes brought on by the Revolution in Virginia. There are letters telling of the Stamp Act, the Boston Tea Party, the Battle of Bunker Hill, the various county committees of Public Safety, the Virginia Convention, etc. Included are special articles and letters Landon Carter and others wrote to the Virginia Gazette. The material in the nineteenth century becomes again the record of a family, with special interest in state banking, White Sulphur Springs, and social life in Virginia and Washington, D. C. There are account books for the Sabine Hall Estate from 1858-1879 and much material on the settlement of the estate of Robert Wormeley Carter (d. 1861). The papers of A. N.
