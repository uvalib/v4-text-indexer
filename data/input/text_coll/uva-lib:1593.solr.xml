      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE PREFACE A translation of the Yen T'ieh Lun, Discourses on Salt and Iron, by the Han literatus Huan K'uan (Ist cent. B.C.), has not hitherto been attemped. The present rendering of the first four chüan (nineteen chapters) of the ten (sixty chapters) into which the work has usually been divided, is primarily for the uses of Western readers; and, accordingly, much that has been familiar or even commonplace to the Chinese scholar erudite, is set forth in detail in the notes. Nevertheless, this important literary work of the early Han period, containing what has been termed material of fundamental importance, is perhaps not known as fully to the Chinese themselves, as it deserves; and the present rendering into English may serve the further useful purpose of attracting the attention of Chinese students to a work which so graphically describes the social order of early China. Hitherto the efforts of Western sinologues have been centred very largely on an exposition of the life and thought of China before the great imperial consolidations of the Ch'in (220-206 B.C.) and Han (206 [202] B.C.-220 A.D.) eras. To be sure, the principles of Chinese ethics, political science and social economy were formulated in the ante-Han centuries, and a literature, rich enough indeed, but whose authenticity is often in dispute, has passed down from these early times. But much of our concept of the earlier era, particularly of the venerated Chou dynasty (? 1122-249 B.C.), risks being but an idealized creation of the Han scholars and administrators. It is in the first two centuries before the Christian era that a knowledge of the conditions attending the societal development of the Chinese people rests on firmer ground. The mists of antiquity lift then, and the innumerable and indefatigable writers, compilers, and editors, who make the time so fruitful in letters, disclose the vast Empire, filled with an active and energetic people, creating a cultural system, which for impressiveness and influence upon the world of Asia Major, was not surpassed by Greece and Rome in the Occident. XII Of this world we have as yet only glimpses, and its richness, in all the varied aspects of human activity, still remains largely a subject for such studies, as our own prototypes, the Mediterranean civilizations, have already enjoyed. One work, monumental in scholarship, the translation into French of the first forty-seven chapters of the Shih-chi, the Historical Memoirs of Ss?-ma Ch'ien, by the late Édouard Chavannes, provides in part a view of China of the second century B.C. Other Western scholars are continuing the task of translating documents of this era, disclosing more and more the Chinese world contemporary with the Roman empire at its greatest extent. The Yen T'ieh Lun is one of the significant works of the time, dealing as it does with the fundamental problems, social, political and economic, which confronted the administrators of the expanding Chinese empire of two milleniums ago. It comprises, in effect, an epitome of Chinese thought and racial experience to the time of the compilation of the work, in the first half of the century before the Christian era. The wealth of historical and literary allusion which embellishes the text, forms a thesaurus for the Western student of early China. For Huan K'uan's pages not only introduce the reader to the author's own times, but lead back to the earlier world of Chinese origins in history and tradition. In the undertaking of reproducing in a Western language, utterly alien to the original Chinese literary medium, Huan K'uan's first nineteen chapters, I have been fortunate in availing myself of the methods of the European school of sinology. For this advantage I am especially grateful to Dr. J. J. L. Duyvendak, Professor of Chinese and Director of the Sinologisch Instituut at the University of Leiden, Holland, who has generously provided his suggestions and criticism toward a solution of many difficult and obscure passages in the Chinese text. Professor Duyvendak's studies in the economic and political principles of the Chinese School of Law have enabled him to indicate in the Yen T'ieh Lun important currents of thought which prompted the administrative policies of the Han period, and which proceeded from centuries earlier than Huan K'uan's time. I have drawn freely, as well, for material in my notes, on the studies of other European scholars, such as Professors Soothill, Maspero, Pelliot, Granet, Karlgren, Franke, Forke, and Margouliès. XIII For interpretations of the political and economic theory of ancient China, the writings of the late Liang Ch'i-ch'ao have furnished me with valuable suggestions; and for a consideration of the prose of the Han period in its relation to the vernacular language of the time, I have relied on Dr. Hu Shih's studies. It has seemed unnecessary to append a bibliographical list of authorities consulted. These are cited by name in the foot-notes. The various editions of the Yen T'ieh Lun are discussed in the Introduction. References to Chinese works are usually made only by chapter or book, as the enumeration of the folio number is rarely of utility, due to the variations in the pagination of the innumerable editions of the older standard works. Citations from secondary Chinese sources have been generally avoided as of questionable value. In the preliminary translation work, I have had the cooperation of Mr. Lin Tung-chi, M. A., assistant in the department of Oriental languages of the University of California, scion of a distinguished family of administrators and scholars, who happily combines, as so many of his nationals of the present generation, a sound background in his national culture with an alert appreciation of Western critical methodology. It is a truism that the most fruitful work in Chinese studies will continue to grow from the cooperation of Chinese and Occidental scholarship. To Baron Peter A. Boodberg, Ph. D., I owe frequent suggestions in the phrasing of certain passages; and the not inconsiderable task involved in the compilation of the glossaries has been undertaken by him. I am to acknowledge my special indebtedness to Dr. Robert G. Sproul, President of the University of California, and to the Chairman of the Board of Research, Professor Armin O. Leuschner, for their generous support of the protracted research connected with the present work; and to Dr. Berthold Laufer, dean of American sinologists, for his continued interest and encouragement. For the completion of the translation of the Yen T'ieh Lun, the American Council of Learned Societies, through the Committee for the Promotion of Chinese Studies, has provided a subvention. For rendering the many quotations found in the Yen T'ieh Lun, I have had recourse to the standard translations of Legge, Soothill, Duyvendak, Dubs and others, on the principle of not doing over XIV again what has already been adequately done. In style, my own translation of Huan K'uan's text may at times appear a departure from the English idiom, for in this admittedly difficult text, it has often been found necessary to provide the literal rendering of the original Chinese, to retain its true meaning and spirit. The temptation is ever present to interpret, rather than to translate. Passages will doubtless be found which have been misconstrued. The responsibility for such lapses will be wholly assumed by the translator, the more readily as I shall not be the first to fall into such error, "for where even the strongest fall, the weak need not be ashamed to slip".

      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION 2 INTRODUCTION CHAPTER I HISTORICAL BACKGROUNDS OF THE DEBATE When Wu-ti1 1 . , the "Martial Emperor" of the Han dynasty, lay on his death bed, after a reign of no less than fifty-four years (140—87 B. C.), the first period in the history of the Chinese Empire was drawing to its close. Ended was the era of prodigious activity in every department of life, when all the latent forces of the consolidated Chinese state sought freedom of expression. The first cursory inventory of Chinese civilization was being completed. Ss?-ma Ch'ien2 2 (died at the beginning of the reign of Emperor Chao, 86—74 B. C.), author of the Shih-chi , a history of China from the earliest ages down to about 100 B. C. The first forty-seven chapters have been translated by Édouard Chavannes under the title of Les Mémoires historiques de Se-ma Ts'ien. had just written the last pages of his great history. Everywhere scholars were applying themselves to the task of digesting mentally the accumulated literary material of preceding centuries. Though a Canon was not yet established, the Biblia of Chinese moral philosophy were already taking shape. Saints were being allotted their respective niches in the Pantheon, and fragments of ancient lore were being collected in sufficient number to supply numerous preachers with unanswerable and unshakable texts. At whatever date be fixed the origin of one of the most fundamental ideas of Chinese civilization, the concept that the principal function of government is education,3 3 . Biot, É., Essai sur l'Histoire de l'Instruction publique en Chine, Sect. VII, gives Han Wu-ti's edicts on the promotion of scholarship. Cf. YTL. p. 27, note 3. there is no doubt that in the middle Han period it formed the corner-stone of Chinese political science. An article of faith, it speedily became a method. Chinese thought was set in didactical forms. The homilies of the Han pamphleteers, all written ad usum delphini, set the standard for future literary productions. The scholars of the Han renaissance, the "Literati", whose models were the itinerant sages of old, aspired again to the position of permanent pedagogue at the side of the "Son of Heaven". They have for ages deplored the fact that during Wu Ti's reign, when blood and iron policy ruled supreme, the gentle, ceremonious method of rule of their paragons of Imperial virtue, the Emperors Wên and Ching,1 1 (179—156, B. C.); (156—141, B. C). Perusal of the annals of these two Emperors reveals that their reigns were not altogether peaceful. Cf. Granet, La Civilisation chinoise, 455. was shaken to its foundation. This resulted from pernicious influences at the Court, where the combined forces of Taoist quacks and unprincipled adventurers, devoid of culture and refinement, as the "Confucian" scholars viewed them, brought again to light the sinister methods and the fatal policies of the execrated Shang Yang and his like.2 2 Cf. Wieger, Textes historiques, I, 463, for the intervention of Taoists in affairs of state at-the beginning of Wu-ti's reign. The intimate relationship of the School of Law (with its anti-cultural and anti-moral principles, represented by the administrative officials_ to the Taoists, is set forth by Duyvendak in The Book of Lord Shang, 88, 91, 124. Cf. YTL., ch. VII. It is clear, nevertheless, that behind the veil of gross superstition upon which the later Confucian historians loved to dwell, to show the depth of depravity reached by the Court, a battle of ideological principles went on between two traditions. On the one hand was the party repository of technical knowledge, the Legalists, with their reliance on Power and their relationship to the Taoists, and on the other hand that of the moralists, later to be distinguished sharply as the Confucian school. The great stage of history is, however, occupied by those whose primary concern is "real politik", "les hommes de grandes affaires", whose philosophical and religious affiliations are not always clear. Such are the two outstanding personalities of the age, Sang Hung-yang,3 3 . Cf. YTL., p. 1, note 3; p. 106, note 1. the Lord Grand Secretary of the Yen T'ieh Lun, and Ho Kuang,4 4 . Cf. Giles, Chi.

Dict., No. 653. the "king-maker", men who, busy with the government of the far-flung empire, have little time to bother with ideological XIX subtilties and yet are unconsciously swayed by them, and too often see their policies checked by the doctrinaire arguments of the despised "intellectuals". Sang Hung-yang's whole economic policy, dictated by the exigencies of his master's imperialistic activity, was subjected to the fire of a vicious attack by the men of letters during the famous forum on "Salt and Iron" in the sixth year of Chao Ti's reign (81 B. C.). This debate serves as the canvass on which Huan K'uan embroiders many a dialectical gem, and into which he weaves the red thread of "Confucian" aphorisms and "sacred texts". The effective consolidation of the Chinese Empire first took place at the end of the third, and the beginning of the second century before the Christian era. Numerous feudal states, largely autonomous, and hitherto constantly at war with one another save for the brief period of Ch'in's supremacy, were now united under the strong hand of the first emperor of the Han dynasty, Liu Pang, posthumously canonized as Kao Tsu1 1 (206—195 B. C.) The Middle Kingdom developed rapidly in industry and commerce, as well as intellectually, from the fifth century onward. Energetic individuals, distinguished for their great wealth, began to appear, and the names and deeds of many of them are found preserved in the chronicles of the time.2 2 Cf. Ch'ien-han-shu CXXIX, Huo-shih-lieh-chuan. "The merchants of Yüan, Chou, Ch'i and Lu spread all over the world," YTL. p. 16. Two of the early Chinese industrialists, I-tun and Kuo Tsung,3 3 . are recorded as having amassed princely fortunes through the production of salt and iron. The one resided in Lu,4 4 . in the modern province of Shantung, traditional site of salt manufacture, the other was a citizen of Han-tan.5 5 . The Cho family6 6 . of Shu,7 7 . the K'ung family8 8 . of Yüan,9 9 . and the Tsao Ping family10 10 . of Lu, were all prosperous iron workers, while XX a certain Tiao Chien1 1 . of Ch'i2 2 . accumulated a colossal sum through salt manufacturing and fisheries. Prior to the Han period, the statesmen and scholars of China, had all, irrespective of the "school" of thought to which later centuries assigned them, stressed the importance of agriculture.3 3 As, e. g., the Mencius and the Shang-chün-shu, though with different objectives. Cf. Duyvendak, op. cit., 91. Farming was looked upon as the fundamental of national wealth; industry and commerce as merely accessory to the cultivator, "so that his iron implements might be supplied by the artisan and his produce distributed by the trader". Apart from this basic agreement on all sides, various shades of opinion arose. Generally two groups of thinkers dominated, schools which in time came to be designated as the School of Law, the fa-chia,4 4 . and the "Confucian School",5 5 . the ju-chia, which based itself on the transmitted doctrines of Confucius and his successors. The jurists or writers on law, representing the fa-chia, were not, so far as their extant works indicate, a numerous class, though many lost books are also cited in the catalogues. They did not compare in popular esteem with their antagonists, the austere followers of Confucius.6 6 Cf. YTL. p. 38, note 9. The Kuan-tz?,7 7 . the Shang-chün-shu8 8 . and the Han-fei-tzü9 9 . exhaust the names of their greatest texts. But as the dominant politicians of the times, having by their effective financial resource fulness the ear of their sovereign, the power and importance of the writers of the School of Law continued to grow. The influence of their methods is clearly discernible into Han times. The opponents of the representatives of the fa-chia, the ju,10 10 . are defined in the introductory sentence of chapter XI of the Yen T'ieh Lun as those who "venerate Confucius as their intellectual progenitor, and intone lauds in praise of his virtue as being unsurpassed from XXI high antiquity down to the present time."1 1 . The ju were thus the Han representatives of the school of Confucius. The strife in words as disclosed in the Yen T'ieh Lun, represents the conflict between the economic and political ideology of this group and that of the Han administrative officials, who may be described as the inheritors of the principles of the fa-chia writers of the preceding centuries. This strife did not have for its actual backgrounds merely ideological disputation. According to the Confucian tradition, the adherents of the school did not assume to be philosophers. Confucius believed himself to be a man of action, an administrator and politician, capable of conducting the world in the true Way. His ambition was not to record his ideas but to put them into operation through the government of a principality, entrusted to him by his sovereign. Those who followed him, his disciples, did not, accordingly, look to him for a philosophical system, but for a science of government. Displaced in the councils of their princes by the practical administrators of the fa-chia, they were not prepared to resign themselves to the passive role of disseminators of ideas, after having expected to be the rulers of men.2 2 Cf. Maspero, La Chine Antique, 542—543. On the other hand, the School of Law could not properly be designated a school, in-so-far as claiming to be based upon the principles of a founder; it consisted merely of such persons as were inclined to think of government after a certain fashion, and who attempted to associate their empirical view of the world with the principles of such school as that to which each one may have belonged.3 3 Ibid., 515—528. In early Chinese economic and political thought we find then, on the one hand, the administrators, the responsible officials, advocating certain methods of government, adumbrated in the writings of the fa-chia, and, on the other, the intellectuals not in office, the ju, pursuing certain ideas ascribed to Confucius and his successors. It may generally be said that the School of Law emphasized the problem of production, while their opponents, the men of letters, XXII stressed the problem of distribution. They were frankly in favor of trading activities, as clearly exposed in the writings of Mencius.1 1 Op. cit., II, i, v. In the late Vth and early VIth centuries, a work assigned to Li K'uei2 2 , minister to Marquis Wên of Wei (424—387 B. C.). The book which stands to his name is probably not his own, and may have been composed somewhat later. Duyvendak, op. cit., 43, 72. applied the principles of the law writers and employed scientific statistical methods to problems of political economy. The two central points of his policy were 1) full utilization of soil productivity, and 2) equalization of grain prices. This policy was directed to the encouragement of agriculture. As industry and commerce began to prosper after the middle of the Warring States period, two branches of the School of Law came into being. First, the agrarian branch was represented by the Shang-chün-shu laying stress on agriculture; second, the commercial branch was represented by part of the Kuan-tz? text, laying more emphasis on commerce. The school of the Kuan-tz? emphasized especially the importance of the currency and of grain, a suitable control of which would contribute to the wealth of the nation. It held that evils resulting from powerful combinations were due to private manipulations of money and of grain prices. To prevent private competition and the resultant inequality of wealth among the people, what may be termed nationalization of capital was proposed, and the undertaking of commerce by the state. It further advocated nationalization of the salt and iron industries as a source of public revenue. Whether agrarian or commercial, the writers of the School of Law all based their economic policy on national aims, i.e., "I can expand the territory and enrich the treasury for the Prince". The school of Mo Ti, the Mo-chia,3 3 . Cf. YTL., p. 116, note 2. emphasized production also. But the concept of production was connected with consumption, i.e., to them regulated consumption meant equally production. It is from this theory of regulated consumption that the school attacked the observance of funeral rites, the performance of music, and aggressive warfare. It maintained the theory that by manufacturing necessities to the exclusion of luxuries, the productivity of a nation would naturally increase. XXIII The Confucianist economists emphasized the word Equality, chün.1 1 . Lun-yü, XVI, i, 10; YTL., p. 4. Confucius said, "The ruler of a kingdom or the chief of a house is not concerned about his people being few, but about lack of equitable treatment". The idea is to stress the problem of distribution. But the problems of production and consumption are considered too. The Ta Hsüeh2 2 , X, 19 [Legge]. of the Confucian School says, "Let the producers be many and the consumers few. Let there be activity in the production, and economy in the expenditure. Then the wealth will always be sufficient". This school purports to concern itself primarily with the "people's economy" or "social economy", in the modern terminology popular in China. The belief was held that if the problem of social economy were solved, the political or fiscal regimen would take care of itself, thus relying upon Confucius, "If the people enjoy plenty, with whom will the Prince share want? But if the people are in want, with whom will the Prince share plenty?"3 3 Lun-yü, XII, ix, 4 [Legge]. YTL., p. 95. Hence the strong condemnation of this school upon the law writers' policy of "enriching the state". The legalist financiers were condemned as "money grabbers",4 4 . or "small men", probably because when the ruler and the state were not distinctly differentiated, to enrich the state was to enrich the ruler; and also because concentration of wealth in the government would discourage individual initiative. The Confucianists would not therefore adopt the policy of state interference in individual activity. The function of the government was to remove all obstacles to the productivity of labor, or to equality in the distribution of wealth. The rest would be left to the people.5 5 Cf. Liang Ch'i-ch'ao , History of Ante-Ch'in Political Thought , 295—298. Now there would appear a reversal of policy or principle on the part of what may be termed the Confucian school of the early Han era. Due to the development of the state, the scholars, unlike XXIV their most articulate prototype Mencius,1 1 Cf. Mencius, II, i, v, noted supra. no longer whole-heartedly favor trade. This seems to have come about due to the fact that practical statesmen, such as Sang Hung-yang, responsible for financing an extravagant government, sought to control the profits of industry and commerce for the benefit of the public exchequer. Confucianism, as represented in the writings of Mencius, called for a laissez faire policy, government by remote influence, the impressive but inactive "virtue" of the Ruler.2 2 YTL., p, 76, note 4. The Han Confucianists now resented the interference of the state in industry and trade, and hence are made to appear to oppose such activities on general principles, which was certainly not the case. Per contra, the Han dynasts, parvenus as they were, even compared with the house of Ch'in which preceded them, erected a façade of conformance to "Confucianism". To acquire prestige, they professed to follow the practices, largely fictive, we may believe, of the venerated house of Chou. They were prepared to conform to the outward ceremonies and observances of traditional antiquity. But in the actual administrative measures of the state, they reverted to the execrated policies of the legalist statesmen of Ch'in, whose aim had been to unify the state, by controlling all activities. While in Shang Yang's time, as Prime Minister of Ch'in, all was subordinated to agriculture and war, now state control of industry and commerce in the expanded Han Empire, was of equal importance. It was at this point that in the early Han reigns the "Confucianists", represented by the Literati of the Yen T'ieh Lun, and the legalist statesmen, such as Sang Hung-yang, diverged. The former, desirous of reviving "antiquity", harked back to a perhaps largely factitious "feudal" period; the latter sought to revive and restore in practice the state control of private undertakings of the Ch'in regime. Seeming paradoxes3 3 Cf. YTL., ch. VII, especially p. 49, note 2; also p. 82, note 5, and p. 79, note 1. For the development of this theme, see Duyvendak, Historie en Confucianisme (Leiden, 1930, pp. 26—28); also, The Book of Lord Shang, 128, and Granet, La Civilisation chinoise, 467 seq. in the Yen T'ieh Lun where the men of letters, the ju, oppose trade, and the Secretary, Sang Hung-yang, advocates XXV the practices of antiquity, are only intelligible in the light of this interpretation. The first of the Han Emperors, Kao Tsu, favored agriculture at the expense of industry and commerce, by discriminations enforced against the mercantile classes. This included ineligibility to public office. Kao Tsu's agrarian policy was continued by his immediate successors by the reduction of the land tax.1 1 YTL., p. 94, note 2. This bore fruit in China's "golden age of agriculture". Within little more than two generations, however, the Chinese Empire appears to have increased greatly in population, with large numbers of people congregating in growing urban centres. Constant "treasury deficits", represented actually by lack of supplies for the armies on the frontiers, were incurred through costly campaigns which extended the boundaries of China to the most distant regions of eastern Asia.2 2 Ibid., p. 102 seq. In the distress of the people and the state, new sources of revenue had to be devised.3 3 Ibid., p. 4 seq., p. 10. To meet the fast approaching bankruptcy of the government, various expedients were resorted to. Notably the yen-t'ieh-kuan,4 4 . officers to control the salt and iron industries, were instituted in 119 B.C., in Han Wu-ti's reign. Salt and iron were the two most universal necessities, after grain, in the ancient Chinese commonwealth. Their sale by government agency, on the plea of adjusting the price, was maintained at such a high rate as to yield a heavy profit. In the year 115 B.C., officers to "equalize distribution", chün shu,5 5 . which may be termed equable marketing, were appointed. These functionaries undertook to regulate commercial transactions throughout the Empire. Their duty appears to have been to purchase staple commodities when cheap and sell them when dear, thus preventing prices from falling too low or becoming excessively high. A bureau of "equalization and standardization", p'ing chun,6 6 . YTL., p. 2, notes 1, 2, 3; p. 10, note 4. to regulate the system of equable marketing, was set up at the Capital in 110 B.C. This was done at the instance of Sang Hung-yang, XXVI who had been promoted Grain Intendant, Sou-su-tu-wei,1 1 , Cf. YTL., p. 89, note 3. in the same year. While treasury deficits now disappeared, with adequate stores of grain accumulating in the public granaries, and the armies on the frontiers once more receiving adequate supplies, the country at large seethed with discontent.2 2 YTL., ch. I, opening para. Due to its high cost, people were often forced to eat without salt. The iron implements employed on the farms, as supplied by the government monopoly, were criticized as inferior and unsuitable.3 3 Ibid., p. 33. To deal with the situation, the representatives of the Literati and Worthy classes, to the number of sixty, were summoned to present the popular grievances before the Throne, in the sixth year of the shih-yüan era of Chao-ti's reign (81 B.C.).4 4 Ibid., p. 1; cf. also, p. 36, note 9, for this da It fell to the statesman and economist, Sang Hung-yang, to defend his and the government's policies, against the demand of the representatives of the people for the abolition of state control over essential commodities, and a return to the laissez faire system of earlier times. It is the record of this memorable debate which Huan K'uan,5 5 . a scholar of Hsüan-ti's time (73-49 B.C), has preserved in the Yen T'ieh Lun. Huan K'uan's work, though nominally representing a debate on the state control of salt and iron, actually covers a far broader field than the title indicates. It touches various problems of government, domestic and external policies, social and economic questions.6 6 Cf. Index for topical headings of the various chapters. Though classed among the ju-chia writers, Huan K'uan cannot be charged with withholding the most telling arguments of his antagonists, the legalist administrators. The work is notable for its impartial and objective exposition of the principles of the two opposing groups of the Han period. The arguments advanced on either side receive equal attention. The literati attacked the state monopoly of salt and iron, the imposition of the wine tax and the system of equable marketing, i.e., equalized or balanced transportation, on the grounds that it was the competition of the state with the people in commerce. This, they XXVII held, created an atmosphere of greed and extravagance among the people leading them from the essential (agricultural) pursuits to nonessential (commercial) enterprises.1 1 YTL., ch. I, passim. The officials are represented as replying to the charge with arguments based on reasonsof national defence. The Hsiung Nu, fierce nomads beyond the northern frontiers, were a national menace. To protect the inhabitants of the marches, fortresses must be established and garrisoned. To finance these operations, the very measures complained of had been adopted.2 2 Ibid., ch. I, p. 3; ch. XII, passim. This is the fundamental reason for the introduction of the state administration of essential commodities in Han Wu Ti's time, called into being primarily by the urgent needs of frontier defence. Again these realistic statesmen pointed out that the wealth of salt and iron was concealed in remote mountains and lonely marshes, and could be exploited only by rich and aggressive individuals. Prior to the institution of state control, there were the examples of Ping of Chü among the commoners, and among the nobles there was Prince P'i of Wu.3 3 . Cf. YTL., p. 30, note 3. The possession of the resources of the mountains meant the rapid accumulation of wealth, firstly by coinage of money, and secondly by the manufacture of arms. The salt industry was highly profitable. Both the salt and iron industries favored seditious enterprises and full-blown rebellions.4 4 YTL., p. 35. It was because of the existence of such evils that state monopolies had been introduced. These measures had centralized financial power in the imperial government as against over-powerful nobles on the one hand, and prevented, on the other, exploitation of the poor by the rich. The literati, however, had their own arguments to advance. They refuted the effectiveness of the grandiose military display and advocated pacifying the Huns through the all-rewarding influence of a benevolent rule.5 5 YTL., p. 4, para f. They saw no value in the cold barren lands, the desolate wastes, inhabited by the Hsiung Nu, and emphasized the self-sufficiency and wealth of the Middle Kingdom.6 6 YTL., pp. 6, 90, 93, 100, et al. XXVIII The spokesmen for the government maintained, on the other hand, that the repeated incursions of the Hsiung Nu at the frontier could only be held in check by military force. As the financing of the troops depended upon revenue from salt and iron, the abolition of the government monopoly would mean the cessation of military expeditions and injury to the prestige of the Empire.1 1 YTL., p. 3. Neither did they hold that the lands of the barbarians2 2 Chinese Turkestan, the Ordos, and other northerly and western regions. were valueless. They recalled how in former days the central districts of the Empire were over-populated. Supplies of water and fodder were insufficient and the hot damp summers were unfavorable for raising horses3 3 Horses have generally not been raised in China due to climatic reasons or shortage of forage. They are to the present obtained from the northern dependencies, especially Mongolia where they are extensively bred. and cattle. All labor being done by men, production was meagre. Even the old and the weak had to carry burdens on the roads and the ministers and officials had often to ride in ox carts. But after the extensive conquests of the Warrior Emperor in the south, in the west, and over the Hsiung Nu of the north, the standard of living had been greatly improved. Exotic products filled the palace, and fine horses the Imperial stud. The populace could now ride on excellent mounts and enjoy delicious fruits.4 4 YTL., pp. 14—15; 92—93. A curious argument was put forth too. The new system placed in the hands of the state the trade whereby the barbarians were deprived of their wealth.5 5 YTL,, p. 14 seq. Cf. Duyvendak, The Book of Lord Shang, 49—50, for a similar principle of the Shang-tz? argument, which is the centrary of the mercantile theory. This novel theory was developed as a means of getting control of the wealth of the barbarians: "Now the treasures of the mountains and marshes and the reserves of the equable marketing system are means of holding the balance of natural wealth and controlling the principalities. Ju Han gold and other insignificant articles of tribute are means of inveigling foreign countries and snaring the treasures of the Ch`iang and the Hu. Thus a piece of Chinese plain silk can be exchanged with the Hsiung Nu for articles worth several pieces of gold and thereby reduce the resources of our enemy. Mules, donkeys, and camels enter the frontier in unbroken lines; horses, dapples and bays and XXIX prancing mounts, come into our possession. The furs of sables, marmots, foxes and badgers, colored rugs and decorated carpets, fill the Imperial treasury, while jade, and auspicious stones, corals and crystals, become national treasures. That is to say, foreign products keep flowing in, while our wealth is not dissipated. Novelties flowing in, the government has plenty. National wealth not being dispersed abroad, the people enjoy abundance.1 1 YTL., pp. 14—15. To meet the Scholars' advocacy of a return to agricultural pursuits, Sang Hung-yang asserted that state control of salt and iron would concentrate the people on the land, thus actually encouraging agriculture.2 2 YTL., ch. VI, para b. His Literati opponents, with bitter irony, maintained the contrary, "Far-sighted and far-reaching in intent is your policy but contiguous with profit for powerful families. The aim of your prohibitory laws is profound indeed, but manifestly leading you into the path of wild extravagance . . . . The result is that we see the farmer abandoning his plough and toiling no more; the people becoming vagabonds or growing idle — and why? Because while they toil, others reap the fruit of their labor. Wasters continue to compete with each other, unceasingly trying to reach higher levels of extravagance. This is the only explanation for the people increasing in dishonest practices and the dwindling number of those who turn to fundamental occupations [agriculture]."3 3 YTL., ch. IX, para c. The Literati, and their associates the Worthies, had been summoned to discuss "the grievances of the people".4 4 YTL., ch. I, para a, . Ibid., note 4. These were the various forms of injustice, extortion and inconvenience, which the people were subjected to by the salt and iron monopolies, the liquor excise and the system of equable marketing. The men of letters were concerned in opposing, as a matter of principle, state interference in commerce and industry. For such policies were those of the legalist school represented by Shang Yang, Ch'ao T'so and Li Ss?, all of whom are criticised by the Literati in the debate.5 5 YTL., chs. VII, VIII and XVIII. There is, however, a deeper motivation for the courage of the XXX "country intellectuals", as represented at least in Huan K'uan's composition, in opposing the policies of the powerful Minister, Sang Hung-yang. This is their determination to recover the "Confucian" prerogative of advisor to the Throne, a position wrested from them by the adroit legalist statesmen, in actual control of state affairs. Their vigorous denunciation of the administrators of the Ch'in and early Han periods, turns at times to a violent invective upon the actual government authorities participating in the debate (usually returned with interest by the latter).1 1 See for example the expressions used in ch. VI, "swallows and sparrows", "frogs in a well", "snakes and rats"; and the abusive allegory of "the Kite of T'ai Shan", employed in ch. XVIII. The Yen Ti'eh Lun thus plays its role among those inspired documents which, like the Hsin-yü of Lu Chia2 2 Rendered into German, with introduction and notes, by A. von Gabain, Ein Fürstenspiegel: Das Sin-yü des Lu Kia, in Mitteil. des Sem. für Orient. Sprachen, XXXIII, i, 1930. of a century and more earlier, were designed for the express purpose of accomplishing the reinstatement of the scholars in their traditional position of mentor to the Son of Heaven. CHAPTER II THE DISCOURSES AND THEIR AUTHOR § 1. Huan K'uan and his Work What is known of the author of the Discourses on Salt and Iron and the origin of his work is summarized in the preface to the hung-chih edition. This note, generally repeated in succeeding redactions, was composed by a scholar named Tu Mu1 1 . of Wu Chün2 2 . in the 14th year of the hung-chih3 3 . era of the Ming dynasty (1501 A.D.), by way of a tribute to his fellow licentiate in letters T'u Chen.4 4 . "The Yen T'ieh Lun, consisting of 10 books in 60 chapters", wrote Tu, "was composed by Huan K'uan, tz? Ts'? Kung,5 5 . a native of Ju Nan,6 6 . who served in the Han dynasty as the T'aishou-ch'êng7 7 . of Lu Chiang.8 8 . The debate on salt and iron is said to have taken place in the shih-yuan9 9 . era of the Emperor Chao (86—81 B. C.). The recommended Worthies and Scholars,10 10 . in response to an Imperial summons and inquisition, petitioned that the official monopoly of salt and iron in the Imperial commanderies and feudal states11 11 . be removed. A prolonged disputation ensued between them and the Lord Grand Secretary12 12 . the Yü-shih ta-fu, Sang Hung-yang. The salt and iron control was nevertheless not [materially] relaxed.13 13 Cf. YTL., ch. XLI, concluding para., where it is stated that the lequor excise and the iron controllers in Kuan-nei were removed as a consequence of the objections of the Worthies and Scholars. "During the reign of the Emperor Hsüan (73—49 B. C.), Master Huan developed and expanded the subject matter [in the form of a dialogue]14 14 Omitted in some editions. in order to establish a school of thought. The book XXXII was engraved and printed in the Sung dynasty;1 1 For recorded Sung editions see section 2, p. XXXV, infra. but due to the lapse of many generations, it became gradually lost in transmission and was little known to people. Master T'u of Hsin Kan,2 2 . while in his second year of office at Chiang Yin,3 3 . found himself in a position to give effect to his administrative policies and to turn to numerous activities along hitherto neglected lines. In moments of freedom from his duties in renovating the people,4 4 , an elegant literary touch, Ta-hsüeh, para. 1. he devoted himself to editing this book. From his own means he had it printed, so that students might enjoy the literature of the ancients in its complete form. Master T'u undoubtedly had in mind the benefit to his own age of the work's exposition of the principles fundamental to good government; its disapproval of private profiteering showed the way, moreover, how the state might be the gainer, for the advantage of posterity". The work of the Han literatus Huan K'uan is thus cast in the form of a debate. This type of logomachy as a literary genre had been already suggested, in more or less formal style, in writings previous to Huan K'uan. Traditionally, the earliest of these might be taken to be the "Counsels of the Great Yü",5 5 . in its present recension, part of the spurious text in "ancient characters", faked by Mei Tsê6 6 . in the 4th century A.D., and the "Counsels of Kao Yao",7 7 . part of the authentic text, of the Shu-Ching (Part I, chaps. iii and iv). The Mêng-tz?8 8 . is largely in the form of dialogues. The work of Hsün-tz?,9 9 . the philosopher of the third century B.C., contains particularly a debate (chap. XV) on military questions between himself and the Lord of Ling Wu,10 10 . the King of Chao11 11 . presiding and occasionally interjecting an observation. At the beginning of the Shangchun-shu12 12 . occurs a brief debate,13 13 Shang-chün-shü ch. I, para. 1 [Duyvendak 167—175]. "On the reform of the law", an XXXIII3 imitation of a discussion on the advisability of adopting the clothes of the Hu barbarians in chapter VI of the Chan-kuo-ts'ê.1 1 Duyvendak, Book of Lord Shang, 146. In fact, the literature of the ante-Han period may be classified as in the two categories of discourses and chronicles. The former is represented by a large part of the Shu-ching, by the Kuo-yü2 2 . and the Chan-kuo-ts'ê3 3 . ; while the latter is exemplified by the Ch'un-ch'iu, its three so-called commentaries, the Tso-chuan,4 4 . the Ku-liang,5 5 and the Kung-yang.6 6 Even in the Tso-chuan, the novel method appears of a debate by means of quotations from the Shih-ching,7 7 . which itself is in part antiphonal.8 8 Cf. Granet, Fêtes et chansons anciennes de la Chine. This form becomes, one may say, a literary obsession with Chinese writers beginning with Ch'ü Yüan's Chiu Wen,9 9 . and continuing with Ss?-ma Hsiang-ju,10 10 . the Liang Tu Fu11 11 . of Pan Ku12 12 . and their innumerable literary heritors.13 13 For the place of these writers in Chinese prose, cf. Margouliès, Evolution de la prose artistique chinoise, passim. In Chapter XXI of the Shih-chi, a debate is described between the scholars Yüan Ku,14 14 . tutor of the Prince of Ch'ing Ho,15 15 . and Master Huang,16 16 . on the question of whether Ch'êng T'ang17 17 . and Wu Wang18 18 . were justified in overthrowing the traditional tyrants Chieh and Chou.19 19 . The discussion pointed ultimately to justification of regicide and the name of the founder of the reigning house of Han, Kao Tsu,20 20 . emerged. The presiding Emperor Wu-ti enforced the clôture to the embarassing controversy by observing that "because one fond of meat did not eat horse liver, did not indicate that he was without a taste for delicacies; that is to say: because a scholar did not discuss T'ang and Wu assuming imperial authority, proved [only] that he was [discreet,] not stupid".21 21 . Again in 135 B.C., Wu-ti submitted XXXIV to his council the question of the demands of the nomad Hsiung Nu for a royal marriage alliance. Whereupon Wang K'uei1 1 . and Han An-kuo2 2 . debated the matter. The famous VIth chapter of the Shih-chi represents the Ministers and Scholars assembled before the First Emperor of Ch'in, respectively offering their advice as to the conduct of the Empire. These speeches appear in extenso. Thus an examination of literary material — and the examples cited could be multiplied — reveals the innumerable harangues and discussions of ancient China. From very early times obscure scribes had employed the debate between Sovereigns and their ministers as a literary artifice to express their own ideas.3 3 Cf. Maspero, La Chine Antique, 435—436. The record of debates before the Throne from the Chou to the Han doubtless stimulated Huan K'uan to produce a literary work in the complete style of the debate. With a store of previous literary specimens cast in the same mould, and the historical debate of 81 B.C. to record, it is to be expected that he would employ this form. It thus fell to Huan K'uan to provide this perfected stylistic medium in the development of Chinese prose writings. § 2. The Various Editions. The earliest printed editions of the Yen T'ieh Lun, of which there is record, are the two noted in the bibliography of editions of works issued in the Sung and Yüan dynasties, entitled Sung Yüan pên shu-mu hsing-ko-piao.4 4 . One is known as the Sung shun-hsi pên Yen T'ieh Lun.5 5 . This is in 10 chüan.6 6 . It has nine columns to each half-folio, and 18 characters to each column. It is called the Sung Yüan old edition.7 7 Loc. cit., chüan b, 19 b. The information is quoted from the catalogue entitled Shu ching yen-lu.8 8 . The other edition is the Sung pên Yen T'ieh Lun.9 9 . It is described as in 12 chüan, with 10 columns XXXV to each half-folio, and 18 characters to each column. A description of the work is quoted from the catalogue entitled Ch'ih ching shu-mu:1 1 . "On the back of the last folio of each chüan there is the following colophon in two columns:2 2 .

One of the leading editors and commentators of the late Manchu period, Wang Hsien-ch'ien,4 4 . observes in his edition of the Yen T'ieh Lun:5 5 Cf. Vol. II, notes, p. 1. "The best copy of the Yen T'ieh Lun is the reprint of the chia-t'ai6 6 . edition of the Sung dynasty [1201—1204]. This was made by T'u Chên, a mayor of Hsin Kan in the 14th year of hung-chih era in the Ming period [1501]. During the chia-ching period [of the Ming dynasty, 1522-1566],7 7 . Chang Chih-hsiang of Yün Chien8 8 . issued a new edition with explanatory notes, the text being divided into 12 chüan, the original having 10 books.

If we are to rely on the results of Wang Hsien-ch'ien's researches, it may be concluded that the earliest edition preserved to Chinese scholarship in recent times was the chia-t'ai edition of the 13th century. That the records should point back to a printed edition of the Sung period is to be expected, as some centuries before Gutenberg and his press, the art of book-printing by engraved blocks reached the height of perfection in China. The chia-t'ai edition is unfortunately lost to the world, but T'u's reprint of the hung-chih period of the Ming era is in current use; and its photographic reproduction is now available in the extensive anthology of Chinese literature known under the title of Ss? Pu Ts'ung K'an,5 5 This assembly of the "bibliographic riches of China" consists of photographic reproductions of famous old editions of important Chinese works. Cf. W. T. Swingle, op. cit., 1922—23, 174 seq. It is published by the Commercial Press, Ltd., Shanghai. The Collected Reprints of the Four Divisions.6 6 . This edition is regarded generally as the most authentic. It is not clear whether the manuscript copy included in the great encyclopaedia Yung-lo Ta Tien was taken from the chia-t'ai edition or from an independent source. As this anthology provided parts of the succeeding Imperial Complete Collection of the Four Libraries, the Ss? K'u Ch'üan Shu,7 7 . Only the catalogue of this work has been printed, containing about 10,585 separate works, representing upwards of 36,000 volumes. A set of this marvelous compilation made in the ch'ien-lung era (1736—1795 A. D.), is recently announced as having been placed in the new Metropolitan Library at Pei-p'ing. another of the vast literary compilations of China and to which access has only recently been afforded, the question remains for investigation at some future time. The edition which Chang Chih-hsiang freely arranged as to organisation, punctuation and textual renderings (the text of the Han Wei Ts'ung Shu), does not mention its sources. Its variations from the T'u reprint, however, are XXXVII now generally regarded as Chang's own work.1 1 Franke in his recent analysis of the Yen T'ieh Lun (Staatssozialistische Versuche im alten und mittelalterlichen china, Sitzungsberichten der Preus. Akàd. der Wissenschaften, Phil.-IIist. Klasse. 1931. XIII, 223—225, 223, note 1) describes only the Chang Chih-hsiang edition of 12 ci an. The original number of chüan was ten, as indicated in early bibliographical references. Cf. p. xl, infra. The Lu edition provides a text based upon a comparative study of the T'u reprint, the Yung-lo Ta Tien text, and Chang Chih-hsiang's edition. The best edition today is doubtless that of Wang Hsien-ch'ien, published in 18912 2 . by the Ss? Hsien Chiang Shê.3 3 . The text is based on the T'u reprint; but for the sake of comparative study, Wang inserts as notes in appropriate sections the textual corrections and comments of the preceding editors Chang Chih-hsiang, Lu Wên-chao and Chang Tun-jên. In addition he appends to his two volumes a body of "Minor Research Notes" of unusual value. These are formed from quotations from the Yen T'ieh Lun culled from various works of the T'ang and Sung dynasties.4 4 E. g., the Pei T'ang Shu Ch'ao , (circ. 601—610 A. D.); the l Wên Lei Chü (circ. 627—649 A. D.); the T'ai P'ing Yü Lan (circ. 983 A. D.); the Ts'ê Fu Yüan Kuei (circ. 1005 A. D.); and the Ch'u IIsueh, Chi (T'ang period) In the preparation of the present translation into English, reliance has been placed chiefly on the invaluable edition of Wang-Hsiench'ien. The reprints in the Ku Shu Ts'ung K'an5 5 . collection, and the Han Wei Ts'ung Shu (representing the Chang Chih-hsiang edition), and the Ss? Pu Ts'ung K'an reprint (T'u's edition), have been utilized in connection with Wang Hsien-ch'ien's annotated work. The texts made use of by Chinese editors of the Yen T'ieh Lun since the Sung era, and their relationship, are represented in the following chart. Necessarily the two editions of the shun-hsi era of the Sung dynasty, known only through the catalogues, are not included. XXXVIII The Relationship of the Editions of the Yen T'ieh Lun since the Sung Era. XXXIX § 3. Authenticity of the Text. Textual variations are to be found in the several extant reprints of the Yen T'ieh Lun. These are traceable doubtless to the inaccuracy of early scribes, who in the course of over a thousand years must have frequently recopied the work, before the block-printing of books in Ss?-ch'uan, from the ninth century A.D.1 1 Cf. Carter, The Invention of Printing in China and its spread Westward, in Chap IX, 48. Moreover, there is much divergence of opinion among the various later editors as to the "corrections" which should be made. Nevertheless, no Chinese critic, ancient or modern, is on record, so far as investigations disclose, who questions the genuineness of this work of the first century before the Christian Era. The earliest notice of the book is found in the Bibliographical Section of the Ch'ien-han-shu2 2 Loc. cit., ch. XXX, Literary Records, ll. which lists "the ten books of the Yen T'ieh Lun by Huan K'uan". In the same work, in the chapter XXXVI on T'ien Ch'ien-ch'iu,3 3 . Chancellor when the debate on Salt and Iron took place and presiding officer of the forum, the concluding chapter of the Yen T'ieh Lun is quoted in extenso, though with some omissions and alterations of the wording. Yen Shih-ku,4 4 . the commentator of the T'ang period, appends the following note: "In Chao Ti's time the Chancellor and the Secretaries debated the salt and iron question with the Worthies and Literati. Huan K'uan edited the discourses."5 5 . To be sure, it cannot be ascertained whether the excerpt in the Ch'ien-han-shu represents the original text of Huan K'uan. It is possible to believe that the quotation is a modified citation which Pan Ku, the great historiographer of the early Han dynasty, made to suit his own literary taste. Chinese prose writing developed with extraordinary rapidity in the century between the two writers; and already Huan K'uan's style may well have appeared archaic in thought and expression to the skilful artist in rhythmic prose who composed the celebrated fu of the "Two Capitals". Throughout succeeding centuries, the Discourses receive due notice in dynastic histories, in the sections devoted to bibliographical XL notices. Thus the Sui-shu1 1 . (ch. 34), the Chiu T'ang-shu2 2 . (ch. 47), the Hsin T'ang-shu3 3 . (ch. 59), and the Sung-shih4 4 . (ch. 205), each list the Yen T'ieh Lun in ten chüan. Huan K'uan is named as the compiler in each case, and is classed with the Confucian writers. The three great early encyclopaedic compendia of literature, aften grouped together as the San T'ung,5 5 . equally take notice of the work, either by unacknowledged extracts from its text (a not uncommon practice of the compilers of these Lei-shu6 6 . or anthologies), or by direct name and citation. Thus the T'ung Tien7 7 (early 9th century). (ch. 10) and the Wên Hsien T'ung K'ao8 8 (13th century). (ch. 15) quote at length from the Yen T'ieh Lun without indicating the source. The T'ung Chih9 9 (12th century). does the same in ch. 62; while in ch. 66 of the latter and ch. 209 of the Wên Hsien T'ung K'ao, Huan K'uan and his work in ten chüan are listed. In all these notices, the author of the Discourses is grouped among the ju-chia writers, save in the Wên Hsien T'ung K'ao, where its compiler, the celebrated Chinese economist Ma Tuan-lin,10 10 . places him among the writers on economics. Internal evidence is lacking, as well, to cast doubt upon the general authenticity of the work ascribed to Huan K'uan, or to indicate that it was in whole or in part a fabrication of later writers, despite the proneness of Chinese scholars of the early centuries of our era to foist upon the literary world spurious productions of their own as the works of the ancients. The style of the language throughout, save where obvious glosses of the scholiasts occur, reveals that it is a work of one hand. The philosopher and essayist Wang Ch'ung11 11 , d. circ. 97 A. D. provides a very early reference to Huan K'uan and his discourses on salt and iron, in the XXXVIIth chapter of the Lun Hêng: "It is very difficult to equal Huan Chün Shan's writings. When two blades cut one another, we see, which is sharp and which blunt, and when two treatises are composed together, one finds out, which of the two is right and which wrong. This is the case of the `Four Difficulties' by Han Fei Tse, the treatise on `Salt and XLI Iron' by Huan K'uan and the `New Reflections' by Huan Chün Shan".1 1 . Forke's translation, I, 468. Differing from such ante-Han classics as the Kuan-tzu or the Shang-chün-shu or the monumental but somewhat discredited Chou-li, there is nothing in the Yen T'ieh Lun to lend itself, or give inducement, to fabrication. It does not assume to be the work of a great and original thinker, for with extraordinary objectivity the author sets forth the arguments of two schools of thought, and it is only due to certain subtleties of presentation that the editor of the debate slyly indicates his prejudices2 2 Cf. p. xlix, infra. in favor of the doctrinaire scholars and thus merits in the Imperial catalogue a somewhat reluctant assignment to the ju-chia, adherent of the "Confucian" school.3 3 Cf. Franke, op. cit., p. 223, conclusion of note 1. Huan K'uan thus does not expound exclusively the doctrines of any particular school, however many there were in his day. In fact the arguments placed in the mouths of the government spokesmen are frequently all too convincing to the Western reader! Yet, as indicated, the author's sympathy is with the Confucianists. Nor does he advocate any systematized program of political, social and economic reform or reconstruction such as is found in the much disputed Chou-li, save in the way of pleas, voiced by the Worthies and Literati in the debate, for economic measures of a more laissez faire nature, and for a more conservative foreign policy. These are only natural reactions of the national exhaustion induced by the over-active reign of "The Conqueror", Wu-ti. All evidence then points to the conclusion that the Yen T'ieh Lun is the authentic work of Huan K'uan in the first century before our era, despite some possible minor corruption of the extant text. It cannot be held, to be sure, that it is an exact and literal record of the discussions of the famous forum of 81 B.C., as they took place between the unofficial "opposition" and the government spokesmen; but that it is generally faithful to the principles and policies which might well have been advocated in the verbal joust before the Throne, there is no sufficient reason to doubt.4 4 "An seiner Echtheit zu zweifeln haben wir keinen Grund", agrees Professor Franke, op. cit., 223. CHAPTER III HUAN K'UAN AS PROSE WRITER § 1. Stylistic Features "Pre-Confucian" literature was in style terse, simple and direct. As authentic examples there remain the Shih-ching and parts at least of the Shu-ching. After the Ch'un Ch'iu1 1 . period (VIIIth—Vth cents. B.C.) and especially in the era of the Warring States2 2 . (Vth—IIIrd cents. B.C.) came the introduction, then the general prevalence, of an involved, prolix, and ornate style. Due to the so-called southern influence, the school of Ch'u,3 3 . and the "diplomats", shuo-k'o,4 4 . the one exemplified in the Chuang-tz?5 5 . and the Li Sao6 6 . of Ch'ü Yüan,7 7 . the other in the discourses of Su Ch'in8 8 . and Chang Yi,9 9 . and the celebrated memorial of Li Ss?10 10 . on the employment of "foreigners" in the state,11 11 . a more poetic and emotional style developed. In the philosophical writings of the schools of Lu and Ch'i12 12 . in the ante-Han period, structure is subordinated to logical exposition.13 13 Margouliès, op. cit., has furnished one of few studies in a Western language of the development of Chinese prose style. For his exposition of the ante-Han schools of writers, cf. loc. cit., 24 seq. Chia I14 14 . is the typical writer of the early Han. His style is held by the lettered to be one of the most beautiful of all Chinese literature. He already manifests a tendency towards the erudite style, with frequent references to names famous in history and tradition. By Wu-ti's time this characteristic became emphasized. Two types of literary allusion appear. One takes the form of brief aphorisms, upon which the argument is developed as a preacher does with his XLIII "text". Or again the style assumes the form of a literary mosaic harmoniously pieced together by means of sentences and phrases culled from a variety of sources. The latter stylistic method undoubtedly became more favored by Huan K'uan's time with the rising tide of literary production, as well as because of the recovered writings of the pre-Ch'in period, furnishing a vast treasury to draw upon. The literary renaissance of the early Han produced material which rapidly became stereotyped in its frequency of usage. The new erudite style depended largely upon quotations from the writings of the Confucian school, later to become the "canonical" books. Well known authors provided further material. The writers of the time indicated their reverence for the old as advocated by the Great Sage himself, by "transmitting antiquity".1 1 cf. Lun-yü VII, i. The abundance of classical allusions and historical references led to their later often absurd applications. The work of Huan K'uan reflects in their entirety these marked literary characteristics of his time.2 2 E.g., YTL. chaps. II, V and XV, especially, where both parties to the debate bandy to and fro the same stereotyped quotation. An alert officer in Chao-ti's reign is recorded as having received the Imperial commendation for justifying the prompt apprehension of a pretender to the throne by a ready historical citation. "Ministers and officers should have ready", said the Emperor, "convincing canonical or historical citations, for every situation!" Wieger, Textes hist., I, 575. His Yen T'ieh Lun combines the style of the discourses of the Warring States and the didactic style of the philosophers; while the influence of the revival of the "old learning" in the early Han, with its reverence for the writings attributed to Confucius and his followers, is clearly discernible. A noteworthy feature of Chinese prose style is the binome or synonym-compound. Two simple monosyllabic words with the same, or at least analogous, meanings are joined together to form a single idea. While this device is already found in the Mencius, the two words forming the binome still may usually be translated singly, i.e, each with its original meaning. The synonym-compound as employed by Huan K'uan furnishes a formidable difficulty to the translator. The two words yen t'ieh in the title of the work itself, literally "salt-iron", actually connote "state monopoly of national resources", XLIV and illustrate the fondness of the Chinese writer for the balance of two complementary words or phrases.1 1 Some couplets of this type from the text are the following: chia-sê, sow-harvest: crop. hsien-shêng, worthy-sage: the wise and saintly. Ch'iang-Hu, Western-Northern Barbarians. Barbarian tribes in general. pi-yü, jewel-jade: gem. chu-chi, bead-pearl: gem. hsi-hsiang, rhinoceros-elephant: ivory. ching-shih, capital-multitude: capital city. yin-fu, replete-wealthy; abounding. jung-chu, melt-fuse: cast [metal]. chün-kuo, military commandery-feudal state: province. This linguistic phenomenon doubtless indicates a significant trend in the development of the essentially monosyllabic Chinese language.2 2 Cf. Karlgren, Sound and Symbol in Chinese, passim. In many cases the literal translation of the binome is superfluous. For example, chün and kuo, "provinces and demesnes", are almost invariably placed together, by literary habit, as it were. The question arises whether the binome represents a natural development of the language in an unconscious attempt to escape the difficulties of homophony; or as might be the case in relation to the written language, which appeals the eye only and not the ear, simply an affection of style. The former hypothesis has some justification, for Chinese prose was sufficiently young to have escaped, as yet, on the whole, the later processes of "fossilisation", by being divorced from the actual spoken language.3 3 "The great syncretism (in grammar and vocabulary) which characterizes literary Chinese from the Han period onwards, was the direct outcome of the book-burning and the ensuing sanctity of the earlier texts." Karlgren On the Anthenticity of the Tso Chuan, 64. The prose of the Han era, influenced doubtless by the older literature, brought to light in the "revival of antiquity" was simple in style. In discourses such as those of Chia I or as in Huai-nan-tz?, the style followed the Lun-yü or the Mêng-tz?. In narratives as found in the Shih-chi or the Ch'ien-han-shu, the Tso-chuan or Kuo-yü formed the models. The prose literature of the XLV time, though not identical with the spoken language of the people, retained much of the natural grammar and construction. In fact, in many cases, the spoken language was partially employed and incorporated in written forms. Instances of this are found in the Shih-chi and Ch'ien-han-shu.1 1 Hu Shih, History of Pai Hua Literature, chap. IV, Prose of the Han Dynasty. Thus, while the prose of Ss?-ma Hsiang-ju (d. B.C. 117) is already indicative of the "fossilization" of Chinese writing, Huan K'uan at least in his liberal use of the binome retained touch with the spoken language. § 2. The Citatory Element A study of the composition of the Yen T'ieh Lun discloses a valuable deposit of material2 2 Cf. Appendix. indicative of the literary resources available to the Chinese writer of the first century before the Christian era. The intellectual backgrounds of the men of letters of the time are made clear through their marked predilection for the use of quotation and allusion. Our own medieval scholastics, "well read in the Latin writers", scarcely equalled in resourcefulness and versatility the literary giants of China, who could at will dig down into the colossal literature of all preceding time and extract an historical or literary similitude to round out their thought. Stereotyped and dogmatic quotation makes its appearance particularly since the Middle Han period, together with cadenced sentence and topical parallelism. Such early Han writers as Chia I3 3 . or Ch'ao Ts'o,4 4 . and their successor Tung Chung-shu,5 5 . For an analysis of Tung Chung-shu's personality and his literary work see Franke, Das Problem des Tsch'un-ts'iu und Tung Tschung-schu's Tsch'un-ts'iu fan lu, Pt. II. are not found to employ the quotation as a mere literary affectation, but as the necessary basis upon which an argument should rest. An examination of the borrowed material, the bagage littéraire, of Huan K'uan in his complete sixty chapters discloses some one hundred and twenty-nine direct citations from at least twenty different XLVI sources. These frequently represent variants from the present-day texts.1 1 On the provenience and authenticity of various ante-Han texts cf. Maspero in Journal Asiatique, CCX, 144—52, and Karlgren, On the Authenticity of Ancient Chinese Texts, in Bul. of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, No. 1, 165—183. In the Yen T'ieh Lun it is noteworthy that about four-fifths (over ninety) of the quotations emanate from the side of the Worthies and Scholars, the Hsien-liang and Wên-hsüeh.2 2 . For the definition of these terms, cf. Biot, op cit., 135. Of the entire number, thirty citations are identified as from the Lun-yü to which may be added seven ascribed generally to K'ung Tz?.3 3 . Ten are from the Mêng-tz?;4 4 . thirty-three from the Shih-ching and eighteen from the Ch'un-ch'iu (9)5 5 . and its commentaries (9).6 6 . The remaining represent direct quotations from the 1-ching (6),7 7 . the Shang-shu (2)8 8 . [Shu-ching],9 9 . T'ai Kung (1),10 10 . Kuan Tz? (4),11 11 . Lao Tz? (3),12 12 . Yen Tz? (1),13 13 .

A number of personages are mentioned in the text but with no citations from the works attributed to them. We look in vain for the name of the brilliant Chuang tz?.26 26 Cf. YTL., p. 114, note 6. The perhaps apocryphal Su Ch'in27 27 . and Chang I,28 28 . whose speeches enliven the Chan-kuo-ts'ê29 29 Loc. cit., ch. III et passim; Shih-chi, LXIX, LXX. and are repeated in the Shih-chi, are made to appear in the mise en scène, but provide nothing for the argument. Tung-fang So30 30 . is mentioned twice, but not Tung Chung-shu, and neither are quoted. XLVII A chapter for each is devoted to Shang Yang1 1 . and Ch'ao Ts'o2 2 YTL., chs. VII and VIII. but no acknowledged quotations appear from the works accredited to them. Neither the Chan-kuo-ts'ê, the Han-shih-wai-chuan,3 3 . or the Kuo-yü4 4 . is cited by name. Yet the six hundred and twenty-five authors and their works listed in the bibliographical section of the Ch'ien-han-shu indicate the volume of literature which may have been available to Huan K'uan. There are accordingly interesting and unexplained lacunae in the citations. Various conclusions may be drawn from this survey. The author's later editors take it that "he enlarged upon and expanded the ideas set forth in the debate in order to form a school of thought."5 5 Yen T'ieh Lun, Hung-chih ed., preface. The supposition is then that the compilation is not a verbatim report, recorded by Huan K'uan at the time of the great forum of 81 B.C. On the one hand, accordingly, it may be assumed that the compiler of the Lun had access to no other material than the authorities actually cited in his text. Many works had been destroyed in the first "bibliothecal catastrophe", the holocaust of literature instigated by Ch'in Shih Huang-ti's minister Li Ss? (213 B.C.). During the disorders which followed the fall of the Ch'in house, and the struggle between Han and Ch'u, most of the great cities were burned. These were the seats of the feudal princes, many of whom as literary Maecenases, such as the later Liu Tê, Prince of Ho-chien,6 6 . had made collections of books. The country-side, too, was ravaged by the armies of the generals contending for the Empire. Only a century or less before Huan K'uan, the law for the suppression of literary works was formally repealed (191 B.C.). Despite vigorous efforts made to recover the ancient writings, even towards the close of the first century B.C. many works were still wanting and others incomplete. It remained for Liu Hsiang7 7 . and his son Liu Hsin8 8 . in that time to restore the national library as represented in the catalogue of the Ch'ien-han-shu. Even if works lay buried in the Imperial archives, as appears to have been the XLVIII case of the Tso-chuan,1 1 Chavannes, Mém. hist., I, cxcic, ap. Ch'ien-han-shu. Huan K'uan unlike the Grand Astrologer Ss?-ma Ch'ien and his successor the Archivist Liu Hsin, may not have gained access to them, though residing at the capital as a lang.2 2 lang — "chamberlain", "page"; t'ai-shou-ch'êng — second administrative officer in a province of the Empire, "deputy governor". Cf. preface to the Hung-chih ed. of the Yen T'ieh Lun. Later as a provincial t'ai-shou-ch'êng at Lu Chiang the presumption is that he would be without easy access even to standard material. On the other hand, with a voluminous and varied literature already in existence and accessible, the author seems likely to have restricted his references to such works as were immediately pertinent to his argument. Moreover as an adherent of the Han ju school, he would defer to those works which, while not yet formally elevated to the Canon, where the only primary sources from which to draw lofty moral precepts and sound principles of government. The scholar disdained to make use of those writers who "at times deny the teaching of the classics and criticize the sages, and at times glorify spiritual beings and gods and put faith in prodigies."3 3 Ch'ien-han-shu, ch. LXXX, quoted by Chavannes, op. cit. This explains the paucity of quotations or complete disregard of the writings of the economic and jurist school, such as represented by the Kuan-tz?, the Shang-chün-shu, and the Han-fei-tz?, works in circulation in Ss?-ma Ch'ien's time.4 4 Shih-chi, chaps. LXII, LXVIII; Duyvendak, op. cit., 31, 131 seq.; Ch'ien-han-shu, chap. VI, under first year of Wu-ti. Huan K'uan was steeped in the Kung-yang commentary5 5 ".... the dry-as-dust and stale moralizing of Ku-liang and Kung-yang .... the real representatives of the Confucian tradition .... predominant in the centre of the national studies ...." Karlgren, On the Authenticity of the Tso Chuan, 9, passim.; Franke, op. cit. 56—86. of the Ch'un-ch'iu.6 6 Chung Kuo Jên Ming Ta Tz'? Tien, 812, ap. Ss? K'u Ch'uan Shu catalogue: . Hence after the apostolic Shih-ching and Lun-yü, the greatest number of references attach to this work, which so engrossed the earlier Han scholars. Seven of the quotations assigned to the Ch'un-ch'iu derive from the famous commentary itself. XLIX4 None of the ascriptions to the Chuan are derived from the Tso-chuan, although the Ch'ien-han-shu1 1 Loc. cit., ch. LIII. Karlgren, op. cit. 29, points to the existence of the Tso-chuan in Ss?-ma Ch'ien's time, the text of which the latter paraphrased in the Shih-chi. Thus it should have been in existence when Huan K'uan wrote. The identification of the quotations from the Ch'un-ch'iu and its(?) chuan's presents a particularly difficult problem. It seems as if the text of the Kung-yang commentary in Huan K'uan's time differed somewhat from the modern one. This may possibly explain why so few of the quotations can be found in the present text. On the other hand, the term chuan, especially as prefixed to longer quotations that are not in the terse style of Kung-yang, might possibly refer to some other "Record" or "Commentary" unknown to us. Cf. YTL., pp. 9, 96, et al. indicates that the latter was in circulation in Ching-ti's time (156—141 B.C.). With four-fifths of the quotations belonging to the Confucian bibliography, and half of these from the Shih-ching and the Lun-yü, these two works appear thus to have already formed the vademecum of the scholar of the time. Contrasted with seeming carelessness in other directions, both of these works are quoted on the whole accurately and faithfully.2 2 It is to be noted that most of the garbled or mislabelled quotations are put by Huan. K'uan into the mouths of the representatives of the "Government party", either out of malice, or to indicate the contempt in which the parvenus of the time held letters. Cf. YTL., pp. 7, 22. 30, 43, 57, 99, et al. It is a striking fact that Huan K'uan's work reveals only one direct quotation from the monumental compilation of his immediate predecessor, and in part at least contemporary, the historiographer Ss?-ma Ch'ien. Too, the quotation is placed in the mouth of the Lord Grand Secretary, Sang Hung-yang, who speaks of his authority as Ss?-ma Tz?.3 3 . Cf. YTL., p. 116, note 1. The great historiographers's death has been determined as occuring at the beginning of the reign of Chao-ti (86-74 B.C.).4 4 A discussion of this doubtful point is found in Chavannes, Mém. hist. I, XLIV. Thus it is probable that his life terminated shortly before the great debate of the second lunar month of 81 B.C. Had the Shih-chi been accessible to Huan K'uan, and had he chosen to make use of it, he would have had at hand a veritable thesaurus of material upon which to draw. Ss?-ma Ch'ien himself records that he placed one copy of his work — whether on boards or silk rolls, we do not know — in the Imperial library, and one at the Capital.5 5 Shih-chi, ch. CXXX, noted by Chavannes, op. cit. I, CXCVIII. But the Shih-chi, in the form completed by its compilator, appears to have L been withheld from general publication for reasons of state, until Hsüan-ti's time (73-49 B.C.), to be again withdrawn from public circulation in 28 B.C. Its contents represented material of a "heterodox" and otherwise dangerous nature, in contemporary opinion.1 1 Chavannes, loc. cit. Thus only a few privileged persons could have had access to its treasures. It has been found, on the other hand, that the Shih-chi, though quoted directly only once by the high officer of state, Sang Hung-yang, yields a number of parallels to Huan K'uan's citatory passages. But Huan K'uan's citations, notably in the case of the Lun-yü, prove to be more faithful to the accepted (i. e. present day) texts than those of the historiographer.2 2 Cf. Chavannes, op. cit., I, chap. III, passim. Ss?-ma Ch'ien makes a notably limited use of the Shih-ching. Only six principal citations from this earliest of extant Chinese literary documents have been noted by Chavannes,3 3 Op. cit., I, cxxxvii. although others are suggested as occuring; Huan K'uan's Yen T'ieh Lun contains no less than thirty-three direct quotations. It may thus be concluded that Huan K'uan had available his own collection of books, from which his citations were culled. Certain passages in the Yen T'ieh Lun parallel in style or content the Shih-chi.4 4 Two interesting examples are found in chaps. VI (p. 34), VII (pp. 47, 49) and XIX (p. 123) of the YTL. This suggests little more than that these writers were familiar with the same documents, and that both made use of much which had become common property through oral tradition. Yet the occurrence of an actual quotation from Ss?-ma Ch'ien's work, in the words of the historiographer himself, would tend to indicate that Huan K'uan, nevertheless, was familiar with the Shih-chi. The caution in its use, however, would seem to corroborate the tradition of its contemporary disfavor. The foregoing examination of Huan K'uan's intellectual background reveals with some certainty this early Han writer's place in the evolution of China's school of letters. He represents, in a word, the beginning of the Chinese scholastic mentality. The time had arrived when the ascendancy of the "Confucian" bibliography LI induced the scholars to ignore the litterature which later was to be definitely regarded as non-canonical. Immediately before him, Ss?-ma Ch'ien earned the condemnation of his own generation by an indiscriminating eclecticism in the employment of all extant literature. Huan K'uan's work may thus be regarded as among the earliest influences which finally formed the Confucian canon.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">TRANSLATION OF THE DISCOURSES ON SALT AND IRON CHAPTERS I TO XIX</field>
      <field name="fulltext">1 CHAPTER I THE BASIC ARGUMENT a. It so happened that in the sixth year of the shih-yüan era1 1 In the second month of the sixth year of Chao Ti's reign according to the Ch'ienhan-shu, ch. VII (81 B. C.). See Introduction. an Imperial edict directed the Chancellor2 2 . Chang* * Note: References to the principal editions and commentators will be given hereafter as Chang (Chang Chih-hsiang), Lu (Lu Wên-chao) and Wang (Wang Hsien-ch'ien). The various editors are discussed under "Editions of the Yen T'ieh Lun" in the Introduction. inserts a note based upon T'ien Ch'ien-ch'iu's biography to prove that T'ien was the "Chancellor" of the debate; also known as . and the Imperial secretaries3 3 : Yü-shih, i.e., Sang Hung-yang , the "Lord Grand Secretary", and his assistants. Son of a shop-keeper of Loyang, he was made a at the age of thirteen due to his ability in "mental arithmetic" . In 110 B.C. he was promoted . For his biography, cf. Ch'ien-han-shu, XXIV, 6. to confer with the recommended Worthies and Literati,4 4 : the Worthies and Literati who took part in the debate had been selected and recommended in the preceding year, (Ch'ien-han-shu, ch. VII). Persons so designated were first called upon to discuss official affairs in the 11th month of the second year of Wên Ti's reign. See the edict in Ch'ien-han-shu, ch. IV., where the Emperor summons them to . and to enquire of them as to the rankling grievances among the people.5 5 ; thus the actual subject for discussion was not specifically "the salt and iron monopolies", as indicated in the title of the work. b. The Literati6 6 Presumably a "spokesman" from among the Literati group assembled. responded as follows: It is our humble opinion that the principle of ruling men lies in nipping in the bud7 7 ; Chang reads . Cf. K'ang Hsi Dictionary on . wantonness and frivolity, in extending wide the elementals of virtue,8 8 For the T'ung-tien reads , "education". 2 in discouraging mercantile pursuits, and in displaying benevolence and righteousness. Let lucre never be paraded before the eyes of the people; only then will enlightenment flourish and folkways improve. c. But now, with the system of the salt and iron1 1 . As to the establishment of the salt and iron control, the Shih-chi (Chavannes, Mém. hist. III, 570—71) relates that in 119 B. C. two wealthy manufacturers of salt and iron, Tung-kuo Hsien-yang and K'ung Chin , were designated to organize the state administration of these two commodities throughout the Empire. A special office within the Treasury was created for this purpose. For the political rôle of salt in ancient China to the establishment of a definitive system of state control in the Early Han era, see E. M. Gale, Proceedings of the Pacific Coast Branch of the American Historical Association (1929), "Historical Evidences Relating to Early Chinese Public Finance"; also O. Franke, in Sitzungsberichten der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, (1931), XIII, "Staatssozialistische Versuche im Alten und Mittelalterlichen China". monopolies, the liquor excise,2 2 ; evidently a system of state supervision and taxation (excise) imposed upon the wine trade. The term has been preserved in this special sense in connection with the transportation, distribution and sale of salt in the officially supervised "salt transportation offices" in the four central China provinces. These bureaux are designated , where salt transported by private merchants is sold by official agency and a tax collected. Cf. E. M. Gale, The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, (Vol. 152, November, 1930) "Public Administration of Salt in China: A Historical Survey". and equable marketing,3 3 . I have adopted the term equable marketing to designate this interesting attempt to solve the problem of distribution in Han times. It has also been translated as "equalized transportation", "adjusted taxation". It appears to be also the name of the officials charged with the administration of the system. The Shih-chi (chap. XXX) assigns its institution to K'ung Chin and Sang Hung-yang. The institution of chün shu dates from the second year of yüan-ting (115 B. C.). These functionaries were distinguished as (principals) and (assistants). They were under the "Treasury" . Their actual duty was to equalize or balance prices by transporting commodities from such places as they were abundant to where they were scarce. The two characters signify "to equalize and to transport". Cf. Chavannes, Mém. hist., III, 579, note 4; also, Franke, op. cit. established in the provinces and the demesnes,4 4 . For definitions see glossary. the Government has entered into financial competition with the people,5 5 Chang's explanatory note gives the quotations from the Ch'ien-han-shu, XXIV, 6, and Shih-chi, XXX, clarifying these technical terms. dissipating primordial candor and 3 simplicity and sanctioning propensities to selfishness and greed. As a result few among our people take up the fundamental pursuits of life,1 1 In Wên Ti's time the same warning had been sounded, but it was as yet qualified by the word `perhaps' , cf. edict in the 9th month of the second year of his reign: . . . . while many flock to the non-essential.2 2 Pên and Mo ; the "fundamental" ("radical", "constitutional") industry of the Empire was considered to be agriculture, while manufacture and trade were considered "non-essentials" ("secondary", "branch" industries). and , trade and industry, were, of course, recognized early as legitimate occupations by the Confucian Literati, who, however, always warned the ruler against over-developing them to the detriment of agriculture. Shih Huang-ti had boasted of having and having enriched the people thereby (cf. Shih-chi, K'ang-hsi Dict. sub ). , therefore, should be taken as designating both the secondary professions (legitimate, though circumscribed) and industrialism, industrialization (condemned in toto) vs. rural life, rural values, rural pursuits. Cf. Duyvendak, The Book of Lord Shang, 15, 43, for a discussion of these terms as employed by the jurists in earlier times. Now sturdy natural qualities decay as artificiality thrives, and rural values decline when industrialism flourishes. When industrialism is cultivated, the people become frivolous; when the values of rural life are developed, the people are simple and unsophisticated. The people being unsophisticated, wealth will abound; when the people are extravagant, cold and hunger will follow. We pray that the salt, iron and liquor monopolies and the system of equable marketing be abolished so that the rural pursuits may be encouraged, people be deterred from entering the secondary occupations, and national agriculture be materially and financially3 3 . The first term usually refers to the extension of acreage, while the second is applied to the disposal of the crops (distribution). benefited. d. The Lord Grand Secretary said:4 4 The "inferiority" of the Lord Grand Secretary is indicated by some Confucian editors, as in Chang Chih-hsiang's edition, by beginning paragraphs one space lower in the column than those in which the Literati are the interlocutors. When the Hsiung Nu rebelled against our authority and frequently raided and devastated the frontier settlements, to be constantly on the watch for them was a great strain upon the soldiery of the Middle Kingdom; but without measures 4 of precaution being taken, these forays and depredations would never cease. The late Emperor,1 1 Han Wu Ti On his "grieving" cf. Ch'ien-han-shu, VI, rescript in Spring of 2nd Year of yüan kuang . grieving at the long suffering of the denizens of the marches who live in fear of capture by the barbarians, caused consequently forts and seried signal stations to be built, where garrisons were held ready against the nomads. When the revenue for the defence of the frontier fell short, the salt and iron monopoly was established, the liquor excise and the system of equable marketing introduced;2 2 The historical reasons for the introduction of these financial expedients are given in the Introduction. goods were multiplied and wealth increased so as to furnish the frontier expenses. e. Now our critics here, who demand that these measures be abolished, at home would have the hoard of the treasury entirely depleted, and abroad would deprive the border of provision for its defence; they would expose our soldiers who defend the barriers and mount the walls to all the hunger and cold of the borderland. How else do they expect to provide for them?3 3 ; has . It is not expedient to abolish these measures! f. The Literati: Confucius observed that the ruler of a kingdom or the chief of a house is not concerned about his people being few, but about lack of equitable treatment; nor is he concerned about poverty, but over the presence of discontentment.4 4 Lun-yü, translation, XVI, i, 10, p. 781. . . . . `I have heard', omitted. Thus the Son of Heaven should not speak about much and little, the feudal lords should not talk about advantage and detriment, ministers about gain and loss, but they should cultivate benevolence and righteousness, to set an example to the people, and extend wide their virtuous conduct to gain the people's confidence. Then will nearby folk lovingly flock to them and distant peoples joyfully submit to their authority.5 5 Lun-yü, XIII, xvi, a concept of early Chinese political writers, that the Ruler could obtain the submission of distant peoples by an example of virtue. Therefore the master conqueror does not fight; the expert warrior needs no soldiers; the truly great commander requires not 5 to set his troops in battle array.1 1 A frequently used quotation of uncertain source. The T'ung-tien, ch. 148, 11 r., ascribes it to ( ?). The passage is indeed reminiscent of Lao-tz?. Cf. Tao-tê-ching, ch. 68. Cultivate virtue in the temple and the hall, then you need only to show a bold front to the enemy and your troops will return home in victory. The Prince who practices benevolent administration should be matchless2 2 Confucian truism; cf. Mencius, VII, ii, iv, with his condemnation of "expert warriors", . in the world; for him, what use is expenditure? g. The Lord Grand Secretary: The Hsiung Nu, savage3 3 : Chang says, murderous, . It is of course the posthumous name of the traditional tyrant, Chieh, last of the Hsia. and wily, boldly push through the barriers and harass the Middle Kingdom, massacring the provincial population and killing the keepers of the Northern Marches.4 4 Or the Shuo-fang commandery established by Wu Ti. The name Shuo-fang as designating the Northern region occurs in the Odes. They long deserve punishment for their unruliness and lawlessness. But Your Majesty5 5 : beneath the steps [of the Throne], "he at whose feet I am", "Your Majesty". This direct address to the Throne would indicate that the Emperor himself, although only thirteen years of age at the time (81 B. C.), was present at the debate. graciously took pity on the insufficiency of the multitude6 6 : a term commonly used in Imperial edicts. and did not suffer his lords and knights to be exposed in the desert plains, yet7 7 Wang suggests omitting . unflinchingly You cherish the purpose of raising strong armies8 8 : "put on strong (armour) and seize sharp (weapons)", referring apparently to the Emperor himself. and driving the Hsiung Nu before You to their original haunts in the north. I again assert that the proposal to do away with the salt and iron monopoly and equable marketing would grievously diminish9 9 : Lu thinks this an error. However, as Wang observes, it can very well be taken in the sense . our frontier supplies and impair our military plans. I can not consider favorably a proposal so heartlessly dismissing the frontier question. h. The Literati: The ancients held in honor virtuous methods and discredited resort to arms. Thus Confucius said: If remoter 6 people are not submissive, all the influences of civil culture and virtue are to be cultivated to attract them to be so; and when they have been so attracted, they must be made contented and tranquil?1 1 Lun-Yü XVI, i, ii, Legge's rendering. Now these virtuous principles are discarded and reliance put on military force; troops are raised to attack the enemy and garrisons are stationed to make ready for him. It is the long drawn-out service of our troops in the field and the ceaseless transportation for the needs of the commissariat that cause our soldiers on the marches to suffer from hunger and cold abroad, while the common people are burdened with labor at home. The establishment of the salt and iron monopoly and the institution of finance officials to supply the army needs were not permanent schemes; it is therefore desirable that they now be abolished. i. The Lord Grand Secretary: The ancient founders of the Commonwealth made open the ways for both fundamental and branch industries2 2 . and facilitated equitable distribution of goods. Markets and courts3 3 Paraphrase of the I-ching . (Legge, Sacred Books, vol. 16, p. 383, para. 15). were provided to harmonize various demands; there people of all classes gathered together and all goods collected, so that farmer, merchant, and worker could each obtain what he desired; the exchange completed, everyone went back to his occupation. Facilitate exchange so that the people will be unflagging in industry says the Book of Changes.4 4 I-ching (ibid., para. 14). This passage is quoted in Wu Ti's edict of the 3rd month of first year of yüan shuo , Ch'ien-han-shu, VI. Thus without artisans, the farmers will be deprived of the use of implements; without merchants, all prized commodities will be cut off. The former would lead to stoppage of grain production, the latter to exhaustion of wealth. It is clear that the salt and iron monopoly and equable marketing are really intended for the circulation of amassed wealth and the regulation of the consumption according to the urgency of the need.5 5 is "to amass". Cf. , "Receiving Bureau" as below. It is inexpedient to abolish them. 7 j. The Literati: Lead the people with virtue1 1 Paraphrasing the Lun-yü, II, iii. and the people will return to honest simplicity; entice the people with gain, and they will become vicious.2 2 : better perhaps, "fickle", "volatile". Vicious habits would lead them away from righteousness to follow after gain, with the result that people will swarm on the road and throng at the markets. A poor country may appear plentiful, not because it possesses abundant wealth, but because wants multiply and people become reckless, said Lao-tz?.3 3 A quotation unidentified as to its source. Hence the true King promotes rural pursuits and discourages branch industries; he checks the people's desires through the principles of propriety and righteousness and provides a market for grain in exchange for other commodities, where there is no place for merchants to circulate useless goods, and for artisans to make useless implements. Thus merchants are for the purpose of draining stagnation4 4 Saturation of a market with local products is apparently meant. and the artisans for providing tools; they should not become the principal concern of the government.5 5 The Literati, the representatives of the ju-chia or Confucian school of the Han period, do not oppose a necessary minimum of exchange and trade. See Introduction. k. The Lord Grand Secretary: Kuan-tz? is reported to have said: A country may possess a wealth of fertile land and yet its people may be underfed — the reason lying in lack of an adequate supply of agricultural implements. It may possess rich natural resources in its mountains and seas and yet the people may be deficient in wealth — the reason being in the insufficient number of artisans and merchants.6 6 The passage is not found in the present Kuan-tz? text. This work has been traditionally attributed to Kuan Chung , the celebrated minister of Duke Huan of Ch'i , of the seventh century B. C. It is now held that the original work was written at the end of the Warring States era (IV—III centuries B.C.) by perhaps several of the so-called jurists or writers on legislation. Maspero classes it as a roman philosophique of the second half of the fourth century B. C. As to the modern pseudoKuan-tz?, perhaps some portion of the original work remains, but intermixed with excerpts from other ancient works, as well as with entirely new interpolations. It is possible, accordingly, that Huan K'uan's citations are from a text now lost. For discussions of the composition of the Kuan-tz?, cf. Maspero, Journal Asiatique, CCX, 1927, 144—152; and Karlgren, Bul. of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, No. 1, 1929, 165—183. 8 The scarlet lacquer and pennant feathers1 1 , in the T'ung-tien and the Yü-lan. of Lung and Shu, the leather goods, bone and ivory of Ching and Yang, the cedars, lindera,2 2 "cedals", Machilus Nanmu; "lindera", Lindera Tzumu, according to H. Giles, Chinese and English Dictionary. and bamboo rods of Chiang-nan, the fish, salt, rugs, and furs of Yen and Ch'i, the lustrine yarn,3 3 could mean also lacquer and silk; lacquer has already been mentioned and besides is not a product of Yen. The two characters are often used together and may have designated some sort of glossy silk. linen, and hemp-cloth of Yen and Yü,4 4 Lung , Shu , Ching , Yang Chiang-nan , Yen , Ch'i , Yen , Yü ; see glossary for these geographical names. are all necessary commodities to maintain our lives and provide for our death.5 5 The whole sentence is greatly reminiscent of the Shih-chi Ch. CXXIX, preface. Some of these geographical divisions retain the names given the nine Chou of the Shu-ching, Yü-kung. But we depend upon the merchants for their distribution and on the artisans for giving them their finished forms. This is why the Sages availed them of boats and bridges6 6 For this passage cf. the I-ching (). `Availed them of boats and bridges', lit. `of the use of ....' . to negotiate rivers and gulleys, and domesticated cattle and horses for travel over mountains and plateaux. Thus by penetrating to distant lands and exploring remote places, they were able to exchange all goods to the benefit of the people. Hence His late Majesty established officers in control of iron to meet the farmer's needs and provided equable marketing to make sufficient the people's wealth. Thus, the salt and iron monopoly and the equable marketing supported by the myriad people and looked to as the source of supply, cannot conveniently be abolished. l. The Literati: That a country possesses a wealth of fertile land and yet its people are underfed is due to the fact that merchants and workers have prospered unduly while the fundamental occupations have been neglected. That a country possesses rich natural resources in its mountains and seas and yet its people lack capital is because the people's necessities have not been attended to, while 9 luxuries and fancy articles have multiplied. The fountain-head of a river cannot fill a leaking cup; mountains and seas cannot overwhelm streams and valleys. This is why P'an Kêng practised communal living, Shun hid away gold, and Kao Tsu forbade merchants and shopkeepers to be officials.1 1 ; see glossary for these names. A variant for the last is (Chang) which would alter the reference from the founder of the Han house, who is held to have enacted discriminatory regulations against merchants, to the practices of the "ancient Emperors". Their purpose was to discourage habits of greed and fortify the spirit of extreme earnestness. Now with all the discriminations against the market people, and stoppage of the sources of profit, people still do evil. What if the ruling classes should pursue profit themselves? The Chuan says, When the princes take delight in profit, the ministers become mean; when the ministers become mean, the minor officers become greedy; when the minor officers become greedy, the people become thieves.2 2 The source of this quotation is uncertain. may simply mean a transmitted saying. This question is discussed in the Introduction. Thus to open the way for profit is to provide a ladder to popular misdemeanor.3 3 : a phrase employed in the Kuan-tz?, as Chang points out. m. The Lord Grand Secretary: Formerly the Princes in the provinces and the demesnes sent in their respective products as tribute. The transportation was vexacious and disorganized;4 4 : Lu suggests , so the T'ung-tien, which is a good emendation according to Wang. the goods were usually of distressingly bad quality, often failing to repay5 5 : omitted by the T'ung-tien, which Wang approves. their transport costs. Therefore Transportation Officers have been provided in every province to assist in the delivery and transportation and for the speeding of the tribute from distant parts. So the system came to be known as equable marketing. A Receiving Bureau has been established at the capital to monopolize6 6 : `cage', `gather together', K'ang Hsi Dictionary, cf. Ch'ien-han-shu, ch. XXIV: . all the commodities, 10 buying when prices are low, and selling when prices are high,1 1 : for Lu suggests . In old texts both characters are used as practically synonymous. with the result that the Government2 2 : "the Government of the Emperor". suffers no loss and the merchants cannot speculate for profit.3 3 : for Chang and the T'ung-tien have . So also the Shih-chi, ch. XXX, . This is therefore known as the balancing standard.4 4 : this was the organ (and the designation of the officials in charge) established at the Capital to regulate the delicate mechanism of the . The measure, for which Sang Hung-yang was responsible (adopted in 110 B.C.), is described in the Shih-chi (Chavannes, Mêm. hist., III, 598). There would be established in the Capital p'ing chün who would have charge of deliveries and shipments for the whole Empire. The several officers of the ta nung were to buy up all merchandise and commodities of the Empire. When they were dear, they would sell; when they were cheap, they would buy. Thus it would follow that the rich traders and the big shop-keepers could not make great profits and would return to the fundamental occupations; and furthermore commodities would no longer undergo fluctuations in price; by this means there would be regulation of prices throughout the whole Empire. The famous chapter XXX of the Shih-chi obtains its title from this expression, p'ing chün. With the balancing standard people are safeguarded from unemployment; with the equable marketing people have evenly distributed labor. Both of these measures are intended to equilibrate all goods and convenience the people, and not to open the way to profit and provide a ladder to popular misdemeanor. n. The Literati: The Ancients in levying upon and taxing5 5 : a binomial compound representing both levies on the people ( ) and taxes on grain and merchandise. Chavannes, Mêm. hist., III, 541, note 6, explains these terms. the people would look for what the latter were skilled in, and not seek for those things in which they were not adept. Thus the farmers contributed the fruits of their labor, the weaving women, their products. Now the Government leaves alone what the people have and exacts what they have not, with the result that the people sell their products at a cheap price to satisfy demands from above. Recently in some of the provinces and demesnes they ordered the people to make woven goods. The officers then caused the producers 11 various embarassments and bargained with them. What was collected by the officers was not only the silk from Ch'i and T'ao, or cloth from Shu and Han,1 1 Ch'i , T'ao , Shu , Han : see glossary. but also other goods manufactured by the people which were mischievously sold at a standard price. Thus the farmers suffer twice over2 2 : ch`ung. while the weaving women are doubly taxed. We have not yet seen that your marketing is "equable". As to the second measure under discussion, the government officers swarm out to close the door, gain control of the market and corner all commodities. With commodities cornered, prices soar; with prices rising, the merchants make private deals by way of speculation. Thus the officers are lenient to the cunning capitalists, and the merchants store up goods and accumulate commodities waiting for a time of need. Nimble traders and unscrupulous officials buy in cheap to get high returns. We have not yet seen that your standard is "balanced." For it seems that in ancient times equable marketing was to bring about equitable division of labor and facilitate transportation of tribute; it was surely not for profit or to make trade in commodities.</field>

LXXXIV, uses the expression . restrict and regulate tax-barriers and markets; in his hand lies the power of adjusting the balance of trade and in his keeping is the right utilization of the seasons; for through his control of the ratio of production2 2 , as in chap. XIV, i. e., the balance between agriculture, and industry and trade. The compound lends itself to a variety of interpretations, "the light and the heavy", i. e., weight; "les poids du léger et du lourd" (Chavannes, Mêm. hist., III, 602), "money" (idem, IV, 49). The present rendering is adopted as suiting Huan K'uan's theme. he can curb the people. In years of abundance with harvest tall, he stores and bins to provide for times of scarcity and want; in evil years of dearth he circulates moneys and goods and tempers the flow of surplus to meet3 3 The T'ung-tien reads for . the deficiency. In ancient days during the flood of Yü and the drought of T'ang, when the masses of the people, at the end of their resources, were forced to borrow from one another in order to obtain the prime necessities of life, food and clothing, Yü coined money for the people out of the metal of Li Shan, and T'ang out of the copper of Yen Shan, and the world praised their benevolence.4 4 : cf. the Kuan-tz?, ch. LXXV: . For these mountains see glossary. Some time ago, on account of financial difficulties, our fighting forces occasionally could not get their pay. Recently5 5 , but the T'ung-tien has , "more recently", in opposition to , "some time ago". due to natural calamities East of the Mountains, Ch'i and Chao6 6 . suffered from a 13 major famine.1 1 Chang quotes the Ku-liang Chuan; "when the Five Cereals do not mature this produces a major famine". It was entirely due to the stores accumulated through the system of equable marketing and the hoard in public granaries that the troops were provided for and the distressed people succored. Thus the goods of equable marketing and the capital of the Treasury are not for the purpose of exploiting the people or solely for military uses, but also for the relief of the needy and as a recourse against flood and drought. b. The Literati: The rulers of antiquity taxed the people but a tithe, while they kept open the ponds and weirs according to season without restrictions, so that all the Black Haired People spread themselves in the southern fields2 2 : agricultural lands in general, as Chavannes concludes. Cf. Mém. hist., III, 572, note 4. never neglecting their occupations. Thus three years' farming would yield a store of one year's surplus; nine years' farming would yield a store of three years' surplus.3 3 This is apparently based upon the Li-chi, Wang Chih (Couvreur, I, 285). This is how Yü and T'ang prepared against flood and drought and made the people content. But if the grass and weeds be not cleared and the fields not regularly cultivated, there would be no sufficiency even though a monopoly over the wealth of the mountains and seas be effected and a hundred sorts of profit4 4 ; Lu suggests . Wang approves as and were frequently confused in ancient times. be developed. Hence the ancients honored manual labor and attended to the fundamental industry, so that they sowed and planted in abundance, everyone worked on the land according to season, and food and clothing were always sufficient. People did not suffer even in the face of several bad years. Agriculture should be the fundamental occupation of men, clothes and food being of primary necessity to the people. With both of these attended to, the country will be rich and the people at peace. In the words of the Book of Poetry: Those hundred houses being full, the wives and children have a feeling of repose.5 5 Shih-ching IV, i, (iii), vi, Leggeis translation. c. The Lord Grand Secretary: The worthies and the sages did 14 not found their families by means of one room,1 1 The Lu commentary in Wang's edition makes for . The later commentators would doubtless delicately seek to ignore the patent fact that the ancients followed polygamous practices, as disclosed by Granet in his several studies on the matter. nor did they enrich the state through one way. Thus Kuan Chung2 2 . won the Protectorate through the shrewd use of his power, while the Fan3 3 . Though Chang tries to explain this as a reference to the Fan princely house, one of the "Six Families" of Chin which brought about its downfall, is undoubtedly a mistake for . See glossary. clan perished because of its strength and size. If one must resort to agriculture alone to make a living and found a family, then Shun4 4 . would not have had to make pottery and I Yin5 5 . would not have had to be a cook. Hence, the Empire Builder acts according to the principle: I honor what the whole world despises and value what the whole world slights.6 6 Cf. Kuan-tz?, . He would exchange the non-essential for the fundamental and secure the substantial with his own emptiness. Now the treasures of the mountains and marshes and the reserves of the equable marketing system are means of holding the balance of natural wealth and controlling the principalities. Ju Han gold7 7 , mentioned in the Shih-chi, ch. CXXIX. These two rivers are spoken of by Mencius (III, i, iv, 7), after the Shu-ching. and other insignificant articles of tribute are means of inveigling foreign countries and snaring the treasures of the Ch'iang and the Hu.8 8 ; cf. the Kuan-tz?, ch. LXXX, last para., where Kuan-tz? develops this idea. Thus, a piece of Chinese plain silk can be exchanged with the Hsiung Nu for articles worth several pieces of gold and thereby reduce the resources of our enemy. Mules, donkeys and camels enter the frontier in unbroken lines; horses, dapples and bays and prancing mounts,9 9 Mules, donkeys and camels and are mentioned in the Shih-chi, ch. CX, as the rare domestic animals of the Hsiung Nu. come into our possession. The furs of sables, marmots, foxes and badgers, colored rugs and decorated 15 carpets1 1 fill the Imperial treasury, while jade and auspicious stones, corals and crystals, become national treasures. That is to say, foreign products keep flowing in, while our wealth is not dissipated. Novelties flowing in, the government has plenty. National wealth not being dispersed abroad, the people enjoy abundance. So the Book of Poetry describes it: Those hundred houses being full, the wives and children have a feeling of repose. d. The Literati: In ancient times merchants circulated goods without premeditation, artisans got their price2 2 ; for this usage, cf. Shih-chi, ch. XXX, as explained by one of the commentators. without cheating. Therefore when the true gentleman farmed, hunted or fished he was in reality doing but one thing. Trade promotes dishonesty. Artisans provoke disputes.3 3 . A possible reading, according to , is or , "artisans excessively elaborate their wares so as to get exorbitant prices". For as , cf. Lun-yü, IX, 12. They lie in wait for their chance without a scruple. Thus avaricious men become cheats and honest men avaricious. In the olden time when Chieh filled the palace halls with singing girls in embroidered clothes, I Yin withdrew himself and went to Pao,4 4 . The Kuan-tz?, chap. LXXX, details this episode. See glossary. while the singing girls finally ruined his state. Now mules and donkeys are not as useful as cattle and horses. Sable and marmot furs, wool and felt goods do not add substance to silk. Beautiful jades and corals come from mount K'un.5 5 . Jade is frequently mentioned by Huan K'uan as derived from this mountain (i.e. the west). Coral could scareely have the same provenience. Pearls and ivory6 6 : lit. "rhinoceri and elephants". are produced in Kuei Lin.7 7 . These places are more than ten thousand li distant from Han.8 8 : the domain of the Han Emperors. Calculating the labor for farming and silk raising and the costs in material and capital, it will be found that one article of foreign import costs a price one hundred 16 times its value, and for one handful, ten thousand weight of grain are paid. As the rulers take delight in novelties, extravagant clothing is adopted among the masses. As the rulers treasure the goods from distant lands, wealth flows outward. Therefore, a true King does not value useless things, so to set an example of thrift to his subjects; does not love exotic articles, so to enrich his country. Thus the principle of administering the people lies only in carefulness in expenditure,1 1 : an expression employed by the philosopher Mo Ti (5th cent. B.C.), in chaps. XX and XXI of his works. in honoring the primary occupation, and in distribution of land according to the "well tithe".2 2 : a system of land allotment ascribed to ancient China, the actual practice of which is in dispute. The expression is derived from the first character, which if enclosed on the four sides, forms the nine squares into which land was supposed to have been divided. The individual cultivators of the eight outer squares worked, it is held, the central or ninth in common for the benefit of the overlord. The existence of the system is based on references to it in Mencius and the Tso-chuan . Cf. Maspero, La Chine Antique, 108—110, and Duyvendak, The Book of Lord Shang, 41—48, for resumés of various discussions of the ching t'ien system of land holding. e. The Lord Grand Secretary: From the capital,3 3 I. e. the capital of the Western or Early Han dynasty. east, west, north and south, across the mountains and rivers, and throughout the provinces and the demesnes, you will find that none of the prosperous, rich and great municipalities has not streets extending in all directions, where the merchants gather and all commodities are exposed. Thus, the Sage utilizes nature's seasons and the Wise utilizes the wealth of the land. Superior men acquire through others. The mediocre burden their own bodies. Thus Chang Chü and Chieh Ni4 4 . never accumulated even a hundred pieces of gold, and the followers of Chih and Ch'iao5 5 : see glossary. The commentators suggest that should be taken as `to trudge (behind) the plough' (as in ch. XV) and as `(wearing out) straw sandals'. never possessed the wealth of I-Tun.6 6 . But the merchants of Yuan, Chou, Ch'i and Lu7 7 . spread all over 17 the world. These merchants doubtless amass1 1 The text has . Lu corrects it to . This character is missing in Chang's ed. `utilizing the surplus'. fortunes of ten thousands of pieces of gold by going after profit and utilizing the surplus. Why then must one encourage simple agriculture in order to enrich the country, and observe the "well-tithe" to provide for the people? f. The Literati: When the great flood threatened Heaven,2 2 , stereotyped expressions from the Shu-ching, ch. I. we had the achievement of Yü.3 3 . When the River broke loose, we had the building of the Hsüan Fang.4 4 : the famous dam, described in the Shih-chi, ch. XXIX. When Chou of Shang5 5 . raged in tyranny, we had the plan at the ford of Mêng.6 6 : referring to the "Great Harangue" forming the first 3 chaps. of the Chou-shu in the Shu-ching. When the world is in disturbance, we have speculative fortunes. In remote antiquity when perfect order prevailed, the people were simple and held to the fundamental; peaceful and happy their wants were few. At that time, few travellers were seen on the roads and grass grew in the markets. If farmers do not work hard, there will be nothing to fill the empty stomach; if weavers do not work hard, there will be nothing to cover our bodies; and in spite of the needs of a great congregation of people, there would be no chance for a potter's family to exercise their craft.7 7 I. e., the art of the potter, after all, is only secondary, and comes after the needs of food and clothing have been satisfied. Doubtless a reference to Mencius, VI, ii, x, 3: . For from ancient times till now, there has never been reward without contribution or achievement without effort.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER III CIRCULATION OF GOODS a. The Lord Grand Secretary: Tso and Chi of Yen, Han Tan of Chao, Wên and Chih of Wei, Ying Yang of Han, Lin Tsê of Ch'i, Wan Ch'iu of Ch'u, Yang Chai of Chêng, the two Chou of San Ch'uan,1 1 . in riches surpassing all within the seas, are famous municipalities of the world.2 2 , i.e., cities with ancestral temples, or residences of feudal lords. They are so not because there has been some one who has helped them to cultivate their country side and till their fields, but because they are situated on the intersecting routes of the five feudal states3 3 The feudal states in the "five directions", , east, south, west, north and the center. and sit astride the network of highways. In other words, where products abound, the people multiply; when the house is near the market, the family will get rich. Getting rich depends on `methods' and `statistical calculation', not on hard manual labor; profits depend on `circumstances',4 4 , "political methods"; , "statistical calculations"; "conditions", "influences", "power". These are typical expressions of the legalist school. Duyvendak, The Book of Lord Shang, 92 seq. discusses these fa chia terms at length. not on strenuous farming.5 5 Chang quotes the Shih-chi, ch. CXXIX: Agriculture cannot be compared with practising some craft, practising a craft cannot be compared with commerce, sticking the needle in [trading in] rich embroideries cannot be compared to getting a favorable place at the market gate, . b. The Literati: In Ching Yang, there is the fertile land of Kuei Lin to the south, the facilities of the rivers and the lakes within 19 its borders, the gold of Ling Yang to the left and the timber supply of Shu and Han1 1 . to the right. Forests were cut down in order to raise grain, and brush was burnt to give room for the sowing of millet. Through clearing by fire for farming and water-weeding,2 2 : Shih-chi, ch. CXXIX. The field was flooded, destroying the weeds but not harming the rice plants. This was done after the grass and brush had been burned. Cf. Ch'ien-han-shu, ch. VI, quoted by Chavannes, Mém. hist., III, 589, note 1. These easy ways of cultivation in the south accounted for the "evil habits of idleness". arable land was extended and natural resources were abundant. Thereupon evil habits of idleness imperceptibly grew up. People wear fine clothes and eat delicate food. Even in humble cottages and straw-thatched huts, we hear ballad-singing and playing on stringed instruments; wanton for a day, in want for a month, carolling in the morning, mourning in the evening. Chao and Chung Shan3 3 . border the great River;4 4 : the Yellow River. they form the connecting center of the radiating roads and are situated on the highway of the world. Merchants throng the ways. Princes meet on the streets. But the people's trend is to the non-essential persuits. They grow luxurious, disregarding the fundamentals. The fields are not cultivated, while the men and women vie with one another in dress. Without a peck of reserve5 5 : peck or hamper, having a derogatory sense. Cf. Lun-yü, XIII, 20, . in the house, the lute thrums in the hall. This is why of the people of Ch'u and Chao6 6 . most are poor and few rich. On the other hand, the people in Sung, Wei, Han and Liang7 7 . adhere to the fundamental and till the soil. Among the common people and yeomanry8 8 . every house prospers and every person is satisfied. Therefore profit comes from care for one's self, not from favorable location on the highways. Riches come from thrift and labor at the right 20 season and not from having supervising officials throughout the year and in increasing the display in the ceremonies.1 1 . The phrase is rather obscure. Chang refers to the Tso-chuan, Chao Kung, XVII, where are enumerated the "bird-officers" of the Emperor Shao-hao. The five "turtle-dove" officers (assemble, settle) the people. On the other hand are the rows of pantomimes used in ceremonial dances. Thus "increase of the rows of pantomimes" is an outward show of wealth. A reference to this use of in the Shu-ching is found in Couvreur, Dictionnaire classique, 1047. c. The Lord Grand Secretary: According to the theory of the Five Elements,2 2 . The Five Elements or Primordial Essences are Water, Fire, Wood, Metal and Earth. Upon these perpetually active principles of Nature, the whole scheme of Chinese philosophy, as originated in the "Great Plan" of the Shu-ching, is based. Cf. Mayers, Chinese Reader's Manual, Pt. II, 333. the East pertains to Wood, but at Tan Chang3 3 . we have mountains containing gold and copper. The South pertains to Fire, but in Chiao Chih4 4 . we have rivers as big as the ocean. The West pertains to Metal, but in Shu and Lung5 5 . we find forests of famous timber. The North pertains to Water, but in Yü Tu6 6 . we find the land of heaped up sand. This is how Heaven and Earth compensate scarcity with abundance and facilitate the circulation of all goods. Now the supply of bamboo in Wu and Yüeh,7 7 . and the timber in Sui and T'ang8 8 . is more than can be used while in Ts'ao, Wei, Liang and Sung9 9 . they are forced to use coffins over again for the dead.10 10 : "turn out corpses in search for coffins". The fish of the regions of the great River and the lakes and the globe fish of Lai and Huang11 11 . are too many for local consumption, while in Tsou, Lu, Chou and Han12 12 . they have only vegetable fare. The wealth of nature is not deficient, and the treasures of the mountains and the seas are indeed rich, and yet the people still remain necessitous and the available wealth is not adequate. 21 The reason is that surplus and scarcity have not been adjusted and the wealth of the world has not been circulated. d. The Literati: In olden times, the rafters were not carved, and the hut-thatch was left untrimmed. People wore plain clothes1 1 is translated by Legge (Mencius II. i. ii. 4, 7; III. i. iv. 1, 4) according to the dictionaries as `hair cloth'. The implication is that it was unwoven, and worn by the lower classes. It may have been felt such as used by the Mongols. On the other hand, there is reason to believe that the term may mean actual fur garments, such as the sheepskins worn by the shepherds and camel-drivers of northern China today, in the winter season. See below "the common men". and ate from earthenware. They cast metal into mattocks and shaped clay into containers. Craftsmen did not fashion novel, clever articles. The world did not value things that could not be worn or eaten. Each was satisfied with his own dwelling, enjoyed his own customs, found his own food and implements satisfactory. Hence, things from distant lands were not exchanged and the jade of K'un Sha?2 2 . Jade in China has been dealt with in various aspects by Laufer in Jade A Study in Chinese Archaeology and Religion, (Chicago, 1912). did not arrive. Nowadays manners have degenerated in a race of extravagance. Women go to the extreme in finery and the artisans aim at excessive cleverness. Unadorned raw materials3 3 : a word favored by Taoists in their preaching of the simple life. Employed by the Han "Confucianists", it indicates that the later Taoist and Confucianist schools had not yet become distinctly differentiated. The word frequently appears in the Shang-tz?, cf. Duyvendak, op. cit., passim. are carved and strange objects prized. They bore into the rocks to get gold and silver. They dive into the watery deeps looking for pearls. Pitfalls are devised to trap rhinoceri and elephants.4 4 : the animals, not "ivory" as above. The actual existence of the rhinoceros in China has been discussed by Laufer and H. Giles. Nets are spread for the kingfisher. Barbarian products are sought out to dazzle the Middle Kingdom. The goods of Kung and Tso5 5 . are transported to the Eastern Sea at a cost of ten thousand miles. Time and labor are spent for nothing. This is why the common men6 6 : cf. note above. and women, weary and heavy-laden, wear themselves out without getting enough 22 to clothe and feed themselves. Hence the true King would prohibit excessive profits, and cut off unnecessary expenses. When undue gain is prohibited, people return to the fundamental. When unnecessary expenses are cut off, people have enough to spend. Hence people will not suffer from want while alive, nor from exposure of their corpses when dead. e. The Lord Grand Secretary: In ancient times, reasonable limits were set to the style of palaces and houses, chariots and liveries. Plain rafters and straw thatch were not a part of the system of the Ancient Emperors. The true gentleman, while checking extravagance, would disapprove of parsimoniousness because over-thriftiness tends to narrowness.1 1 : a paraphrase of the Lun-yü, VII, xxxv. When Sun-shu Ao was the prime minister of Ch'u2 2 : Chang has Chi Wên Tz? (the minister of Lu who used to think thrice before acting, Lun-yü, V, xix) instead of Sun-shu Ao, and Lu for Ch'u . The parsimoniousness of Sun-shu Ao is also confirmed by Hanfei-tz?, ch. . and his wife did not wear silk nor his horses feed on grain, Confucius said: One should not be too thrifty so as to be hard on one's inferiors.3 3 This quotation, not identified, seems to represent a general sentiment of the Chinese social order, for which Confucius is here made the high authority. This is how the poem The Cricket4 4 : Shih-ching, , I, a poem written in criticism of Duke of Chin's parsimoniousness. Cf. Legge, Chinese Classics, vol. IV, Pt. I, 174, for the translation. was written. Kuan-tz? said:5 5 Not in the present Kuan-tz? text. `Hankering after profit' ; Lu suggests . `Will have no outlet' , undoubtedly a mistake, as Lu points out, with or missing. If palaces and houses are not decorated, the timber supply will be over-abundant. If animals and fowls are not used in the kitchens, there will be no decrease in their numbers. Without the hankering for profit, the fundamental occupation will have no outlet. Without the embroidered ceremonial robes, the seamstresses6 6 : the latter character is pronounced kung in the special sense of a "weaving woman", as Chang indicates. Cf. Couvreur, Dictionnaire Classique, sub rad. 120. will have no occupation. Therefore, artisans, merchants, carpenters and mechanics 23 are all for the use of the state and to provide tools and implements. They have existed from ancient times and are not a unique feature of the present age. Hsien Kao fed cattle at Chou.1 1 . Wu Ku carried on a cart-renting business in order to enter Ch'in.2 2 . Kung-shu Tz?3 3 . was an expert in the compass and square and Ou Yeh4 4 . in founding. Thus the saying goes: The various craftsmen dwell in their booths that they may do their work effectively.5 5 The source, really the Lun-yü, ch. XIX, 7, reads for . Farmers and merchants exchange their goods so that both the fundamental and the accessory pursuits may be benefited. People who live in the mountains and marshes, or on moors and sterile uplands, depend on the effective circulation of goods to satisfy their wants. Thus it would not be only those who have abundance that have a surplus and only those who have little that would starve. If everybody stays where he lives and consumes his own food, then oranges and pumaloes would not be sold, Ch'ü Lu6 6 : salt made from the (?) rock salt of Ch'ü, a place name. Cf. , Ping of Ch'ü, a person later mentioned in the YTL. See glossary. salt would not appear, rugs and carpets would not be marketed and the timber of Wu and T'ang7 7 . would not be used. f. The Literati: Mencius8 8 Cf. Legge, I, i, iii, 3, paraphrased as follows: YTL.: . Menc.: . This is an example of either Huan K'uan's carelessness in quotation, or an indication that the extant Mencius differs from the text of the Han era. says that if the seasons of husbandry are not disturbed there will be more grain than can be eaten. If silk 24 worms and hemp are raised according to the seasons, cloth and silk will be more than what is required for wear. If the axes and bills enter the forest according to season, the timber supply will be more than the demand. Hunting and fishing according to season, fish and game will be more than can be eaten. If you do not do all these things according to the seasons, and on the other hand, you decorate the palaces and dwelling houses and raise terraces and arbors higher and higher, and if carpenters and mechanics carve the large into the small, the round into the square, so as to represent clouds and mists above and mountains and forests below, then there will not be enough timber for use. If the men folk abandon the fundamental in favor of the non-essential, carving and engraving in imitation of the forms of animals, exhausting the possibilities of manipulation of materials, then there will not be enough grain for consumption. If the women folk decorate the small things and work on the minute and form elaborate articles to the best of their skill and art, then there will not be enough silk and cloth for wear. If the cooks boil and slaughter the immature, fry and roast and mix and blend, exhausting all the varieties of the Five Flavors,1 1 : Salt, Bitter, Sour, Acrid, Sweet, . then there will not be enough fish and meat for food. At present while there is no question of suffering from fowls and animals not declining in number, and of the timber supply being more than can be consumed, the trouble is that we are extravagant without limit; and while we do not suffer from the lack of rugs, carpets, oranges and pumeloes, the trouble is that we have no hovels and husks and chaff.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IV DISCORDANT CURRENCIES1 1 . The first character is not found in the text. (We have no evidence as to whether Huan K'uan wrote the chapter-titles hímself, or whether they were composed by later editors.) The word has various connotations and was employed in Wang Mang's time to indicate a coin , shaped like a knife and inlaid with gold. Doubtless here the term is an in the Shu-ching, Yü Kung, , `varied', `different'. The other terms in this chapter relating to currency or coinage and appear to have been in use in Huan K'uan's time or previously. Numerous works exist on Chinese numismatics by Chinese or Western authorities (cf. Cordier, Bibliotheca Sinica, I, 687 seq., for the latter). One of the earlier works by W. Vissering, Chinese Currency (Leiden, 1877), is based chiefly on chaps. VIII and IX of the (13th cent A. D.), and its discussion of ancient Chinese currency must accordingly be taken with reserve. Chavannes, (Mém. hist., III, ch. XXX) supplies valuable notes on early Chinese exchange media. a. The Lord Grand Secretary: That the exchange of money and the circulation of commodities still does not advantage the people2 2 according to Wang. is because goods have been monopolized. Even when taking thought for the fundamental and weighing the non-essential, that the people still starve, is because grain is hoarded.3 3 Chang's note calls attention to the Kuan-tz?, ch. LXXIII, upon which this passage seems to be based. The clever are able to utilize the labor of a hundred men, the simple cannot even repay4 4 which should be according to Lu. themselves for their own labor. Should the rulers not adjust wealth evenly, there will be among the people property interests mutually detrimental. Thus it is that some accumulate a sufficiency for a hundred years while others are obliged to rest content with husks and chaff. When people are too wealthy they cannot be controlled through salaries; authority will be insufficient to impose penalties upon them. These inequalities cannot be removed except by relieving congestion and evening profit. Therefore the Ruler must first accumulate the people's food, conserve their consumption, regulate their 26 surplus,1 1 omitted in Chan's edition. ease their lack, prohibit undue gains and check the source of profit making. Only then will the common people be able to provide for their homes and the needs of every individual be supplied. b. The Literati: The Ancients honored virtue and scorned profit; they esteemed justice and held riches lightly. At the time of the Three Kings2 2 , the Great Yü; , T'ang the Completer; and and together, thus representing the traditional founders of the three dynasties of Hsia, Yin and Chou. prosperity and decline followed each other in cycles, but they were able to arrest decline and steady the unstable. Thus it was that the Hsia dynasty relied upon loyalty, the Yin upon reverence, the Chou upon culture, so that the lustre of the instruction in their schools and the deference and self-abnegation of their etiquette was eminently worthy of contemplation.3 3 The phrasing is from Mencius, I. i. iii. 4, et al. But in later times etiquette and justice have collapsed, and good customs are extinguished. Since the gentlemen in office turn their back on honor and scramble for wealth, the big and little devour and overthrow one another by turns. This is the reason that some have a sufficiency for a hundred years and others nothing to fill their emptiness or cover their forms. Those who held office in ancient times did not farm; those who tilled did not fish; the gatemen and the watchmen had each their permanent stations and did not attempt to double their income or corner goods. In this manner the simple and the clever labored without undermining each other. Thus the Book of Poetry says: There shall be handfuls left on the ground; And here ears untouched: — For the benefit of the widow.4 4 Shih-ching, II. vi. VIII. 3, [Legge's translation], a favorite quotation, cf., e.g., the Ch'un-ch'iu-fan-lu, ch. 27; the Li-chi, . That is to say, there was no monopoly of goods. c.

Primitive nature alternates with culture, and this is not a casual change of custom. When social habits decay they must be met by new laws,2 2 Read for . nor is this an intentional departure from the Ancients, but in order to correct mistakes and arrest decline.

The emperors of the Hsia dynasty used black cowries, those of the Chou purple stones, while later generations at times circulated metal currency and knife money.5 5 Statements doubtless based on tradition. There is evidence that cowries must have been used in remotest times. Vissering, op. cit. 3—4, points out numerous words referring to money and wealth in the composition of which "shell" appears. Cf. Maspero, La Chine Antique, 91—92, for a discussion of currency in ancient China. Anything overripe tends to decay, as end and beginning alternate in cycles. Now, if the hills and marshes are not state-controlled, they will yield profit to both Prince and Minister. If there be no interdiction on coinage, the counterfeit will circulate with the genuine.6 6 The question of the coinage had become exceedingly grave in the Early Han period, according to Ss?-ma Ch'ien's account (Shih-chi, chap. XXX, passim). The historiographer tells of the first issue of coins of white metal in the year 119 B. C. (cf. Chavannes, Mém. hist. III, 565 seq.). This money began to deteriorate and by 115 B. C. was worthless. It had been gradually replaced by a brass coin with a red border, but this became debased two years later. Thereupon the government issued an edict making coinage a function of the , and no other money than that put out by its three officers was permitted (ibid. 587—585). If the officials and the rich vie with one another in extravagance, the lower classes will devote themselves to gain, and thus the two will undermine one another. d. The Literati: The Ancients had markets but no coinage; each exchanged that which he had for that which he lacked, packed his cloth and peddled his silk. Later generations have used tortoise shells and metal currencies, [knife coins and cloth]7 7 . Chang's edition inserts these four characters after . as a medium of exchange. But as currency has frequently changed, the people 28 have become increasingly dishonest. Now to correct dishonesty one must resort to simplicity,1 1 : `nature', as opposed to the complexity represented by the centralization of authority. and to prevent mistakes one must fall back upon propriety.2 2 : innate righteousness, attained by ceremonial observances, as opposed to multiplication of laws. T'ang and Wên, following upon a period of decline, altered the laws and changed education, and in the time of Yin and Chou culture flourished.3 3 But for the Han dynasty, which has succeeded to a period of decay, not to make necessary reforms but, with a view to profit, to keep on changing the currency, and yet wishing to return to the fundamental, is like extinguishing flame with frying fat, and stopping boiling with a burning brand. If the upper classes love propriety, the common people will shun gaudy ornamentation;4 4 . but if they love material things, the common people will risk their lives for gain. e. The Lord Grand Secretary: In the time of the Emperor Wên5 5 : the Han emperor who reigned from 179—157 B.C. the people were permitted to cast money, smelt iron, and evaporate salt. But the Prince of Wu6 6 : Liu P'i , Prince [King] of Wu, son of Kao Tsu's older brother. Cf. Chavannes, Mém. hist., III, 543, for his exploits in this connection (Shih-chi, XXX). monopolized the sea and marshes, and the family of Têng T'ung7 7 : a courtier in Wên Ti's reign who was given the right to exploit a copper mine and the privilege of coining money. Cf. Chavannes, Mém. hist., III, 543, note 2 (Shih-chi, XXX). monopolized the Western Mountain, whereupon all the rogues from east of the mountains congregated in the dukedom, and Ch'in, Yung, Han and Shu8 8 , , , . were brought to depend upon the Têng clan. The coins of Wu and Têng overspread the Empire. For this reason the laws against coinage were promulgated.9 9 Sang Hung-yang's statement here follows closely the Shih-chi, loc. cit. With these, dishonesty will cease, and with the occasion for dishonesty removed, the people will no longer hope for wrongful gain. Each will devote himself to his proper task. If this is not a 29 return to fundamental principles, what is it? Therefore unify the coinage, and the people will not resort to double dealing. If coinage proceeds from the Crown, the people will not be in doubt. f. The Literati: In former times there were many currencies, wealth circulated and the people were happy. But afterwards, as the old currency was gradually replaced by the white metal of the tortoise and the dragon issue,1 1 . See note supra. The Shih-chi relates (Chavannes, Mém. hist., III, 565) that the white metal was an alloy of silver and tin. Three kinds of coins were issued. The first was round bearing the figure of a dragon; the second, square, and weighing less, bore the figure of a horse; and the third, oblong, weighed still less, and was marked like the tortoise. they became wary of the new. As coinage changed frequently, the questionings of the people increased. Then all the coinage in the empire was demonetised, and the authority to re-issue new was lodged with the three officers of the Shui-hêng.2 2 : an administrative organ explained in the Shih-chi (Chavannes, Mém. hist., III, 586). In the beginning the "Treasury" administered the salt and iron and dealt with the currency. This was too much. The Shui-hêng was instituted for the purpose of handling the salt and iron. Recently, it seems, a profit has been made and the coins are not up to standard; they are thin or thick, light or heavy. The farmers are not experienced in comparing the relative trustworthiness of such tokens. Thus they suspect the new issue, not knowing the false from the true. The deálers and shopkeepers for the bad barter the good; and with a half, exchange for double. Thus in case he buys, the farmer loses value; if he sells, he violates his conscience. Suspicion spreads widely. If there were proper laws about coining bad money, the presence of privately made coins with official issues would neither aid nor harm the government But if money is discriminated against, goods will stagnate. Moreover the employment of officers will lay up much grief. The Ch'un Ch'iu says, A budget which does not take into account the Man and the I3 3 This quotation has not been identified. barbarians is not sufficient. Therefore let the Prince on the one hand, for the sake of the people's needs, not restrict the use of the seas and the marshes, and on the other, for the sake of their benefit, not shut down on the privately made coinage.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER V HINDRANCE TO FARMING a. The Lord Grand Secretary: If a private individual have an article of value, he places it in a box or cabinet and keeps it.1 1 Cf. Lun-yü, IX, xii. Then what if a Ruler possesses the mountains and the seas? Now the sources of power and profit are assuredly in the mountain fastnesses and the depths of the marshes. Only aggressive people can come at their wealth. In another time, before the sequestration of salt and iron, there was among the smock-frocked2 2 : the common people, the peasants, later "cotton-clothed", but not at this time when cotton was probably unknown. The T'z?-yüan quotes this passage. people one Ping of Chü, and among the princes was the King of Wu;3 3 Chang's note on this passage reads: In the Huo-chih-chuan (Shih-chi, CXXIX) it is recorded that the people of Lu were commonly industrious. A certain Ts'ao Ping through an iron-smelting industry brought unusual prosperity to many tens of thousands in Tsou and Lu, so that many neglected letters and learning and hastened after profit, after the example of Ts'ao Ping. It is said that this prosperity arose at Lin Chü , therefore he is called Ping of Chü. The King of Wu, by name P'i , coined money and evaporated sea water [for salt], so that revenue for his state was abundant. Then he pleaded sick, absented himself from Court, and secretly nourished plans of rebellion. then the salt and iron monopoly first came up as a matter of discussion. The King of Wu took sole control of the surplus products of the mountains and marshes, taxed his people lightly and gave doles to the poor and humble. Thus he established his personal prestige; when his personal prestige was increased, his heart was moved to rebellion. Thus you see if you do not stop the source early and only worry about the outcome, as in the bursting through of Lü Liang,4 4 : the mountain, which Yü pierced, in order to permit the waters of the Great Flood to escape. Shu-ching, Yü-kung, Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. III, Pt. I, 95, note. the damage will be very great. As T'ai Kung5 5 . Source of quotation unknown. said: One 31 family would harm a hundred families, a hundred families would harm the nobles, and the nobles would harm the ruler of the Empire. This is why the prohibitory laws are made to prevent it. Now to give the people free rein to strive after power and profit and to end the salt and iron monopoly would be to give the advantage to the overbearing and aggressive in the pursuit of their covetous practices. All the evil-minded would come together, cliques would become parties — for the aggressive if not constantly curbed are ungovernable — and combines of disorderly persons would take form. b. The Literati: The people have their wealth at home; the Princes have theirs in the states; the Emperor has his in the land within the seas. Therefore the people use walls for their hiding-places while the Emperor has all the land within the seas as a treasure-chest. The Emperor in visiting a Prince, ascends the steps of the Prince's palace. The Prince offers him the official keys, and holding the whip, waits attentive for orders. This shows that he is not the lord there. That is, the ruler does not collect his wealth but keeps it out among the people. He keeps away from fleeting profit and makes the social duties of the people his chief concern. When their social duties and the rules of intercourse1 1 . are established, then the people will pattern themselves after the ruler. Even if T'ang and Wu were still living, they would have no cause for anxiety.2 2 , i. e., these ancient paragons of government by example, would find times unchanged. The business of the workmen and the merchants, the duties of the iron smelters3 3 The offices of Ou-yeh , the excellent sword-maker of ancient times. — what evil could grow out of these? The three Huan4 4 , "the three families", the descendants of Duke Huan, who ruled Lu . Cf. Legge, Analects, XVI, iii, note. maintained the sole control of Lu, and the Six Ministers5 5 : the six hereditary ministers of state from the six clans of Chin in the Ch'un-ch'iu period. Three were in time overthrown, while three increased in power and partitioned Chin, forming three out of seven of the Warring States. divided between them the administration of Chin without the use of the salt and iron monopoly. Thus we see that the sources of power and profit are 32 not in the mountains and the seas but in the court. That one family harms a hundred families lies behind the gate screen1 1 Paraphrasing the Lun-yü, XVI, i, 18. of the [ruler's] household and not in such fellows as Ping of Chü. c. The Lord Grand Secretary: With restrictions upon the mountains and the seas, the people are not subverted. With the establishment of equilibrium in prices, the people are not suspicious. When the magistrates set up standard weights and measures, the people obtain what they desire.2 2 . Lu reads . . . ., which I follow. Even a lad only five feet tall may be sent to the market and no one could cheat him. If now the monopolies be removed, then aggressive persons would control the use and engross the profits. They would dominate the market; prices would be raised or lowered at a word; there would be no stability in prices, dear or cheap. These people would be sitting firmly and would grow more aggressive. This would serve to nourish the powerful and depress the weak, and the nation's wealth would be hoarded by thieves. Nourish the powerful and depress the weak and the rank and file of law-abiding people will dwindle away. It would be like letting the weeds flourish and spoiling the grain. One family harms a hundred families, forsooth, if this does not apply to such as Ping of Chü, what does it mean? d. The Literati: The material basis3 3 . Supply after to make it agree with the line below: "then grain ripens and the road to economic . . . . .". Chang is followed in the translation: (omitted by Wang)] . . . . for economic prosperity is in the mountains and seas; life and death for the farmers lie in their implements of iron. When these arbiters of life and death are ready at hand to use, then enmity will perish; when enmity perishes, then waste land will be under cultivation; when waste land is cultivated, then grain ripens and the road to economic prosperity is opened; when the road to prosperity is opened, then the common people will be fed and their needs met; when the people's needs are met, then the nation is prosperous; when the nation is prosperous and instruction is given according to the rules of propriety, then 33 there will be courtesy in giving way in passing on the road and the artisans and merchants will not compete with one another. Men will cultivate simplicity and sincerity, with the result that they will seek to share with others, and none will seek profit at the expense of another. e. Now in Ch'in, Ch'u, Yen and Ch'i1 1 . the quality of the soil differs. There is variety in the methods of cultivation of heavy and light soils. The use of large or small, the suitability of straight or curved ploughs,2 2 : read . Cf. Chou-li, : straight ploughs for hard earth, curved ones for soft . are different according to districts and customs. Each has its convenient use. But when the magistrates establish monopolies and standardize, then iron implements lose their suitability, and the farming population loses their convenient use. When the tools are not suited to their use, the farmer is exhausted in the fields, and grass and weeds are not kept down. When the grass and weeds cannot be kept down, then the people are wearied to the point of despair. f. Because the places where salt is crystalized and iron smelted are in most cases in mountains and on rivers near to iron and coal,3 3 , also mentioned in Ch. X. Whether coal or char-coal is meant, is not evident. their operation is all remote and their working is laborious. The shifts of laborers are assembled in the demesnes without any investigation as to their liability. g. Utilizing conscripted labor, the county and city magistrates sometimes cheapen the equalized price and make per capita levies [through forced sales]. People of good families are forced in their turn to work on the roads. The transport of salt and iron cause trouble and expense; cities are in doubt as to their population; the people suffer bitterly. As I see it, a single magistrate damages a thousand hamlets. All this trouble is not because of such as Ping of Chü.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VI BACK TO ANCIENT TRUTHS a. The Lord Grand Secretary: In his report on the salt and iron regulations the former military commander at Shan-shui, P'êng-tsu Ning,1 1 , otherwise unknown. has stated that said regulations were very explicit; the conscripted laborers receive food and clothing from the district magistrates and they make and mould iron implements in great plenty to meet the need, with no hindrance from the people. However, there may be subordinate officers who are not disinterested and do not give effect to the regulations, with the result that the people are disturbed and distressed. b. The present plan for unifying the salt and iron monopoly is not alone that profit may accrue [to the state], but that in the future the fundamental [of agriculture] may be established and the non-essential repressed, cliques dispersed, extravagance prohibited, and plurality of offices stopped. In ancient times the famous mountains and great marshes were not given as fiefs to be the monopolized profit of inferiors, because the profit of the mountains and the sea and the produce of the broad marshes are the stored up wealth2 2 , here not "treasure house", "magasin" (Chavannes), "Vorratskammer" (Franke, op. cit., 7), as in the original passage in the Shih-chi. of the Empire3 3 Wang's note: Chang suggests reading for , following the Shih-chi, ch. XXX, and the Han-shu, ch. XXIV. and by rights ought to belong to the privy coffers of the Crown; but Your Majesty has unselfishly assigned them to the State Treasurer4 4 The revenues derived from "salt and iron" should be paid into the shao-fu , the personal treasury of the Emperor, and not into the ta-nung , the public treasury. Cf. Chavannes, Mém. hist., III, 570, note 4. "State Treasurer", actually "Minister of Agriculture and Commerce", a title established in 104 B.C. Ibid., II, 519. to assist and succor the people. Ne'er-do-wells and 35 upstarts1 1 : itinerants, vagabonds, "des gens dont les moyens d'existence sont incertains". Chavannes, Mém. hist., III, 570. desiring to appropriate the produce of the mountains and the seas as their own rich inheritance, exploit the common people. Therefore many are those who advise to put a stop to these practices.2 2 The Shih-chi, ch. XXX, reads . "Les délibérations qu'on a entendues sur les moyens d'arrêter ces pratiques sont innombrables". Chavannes, Mém. hist., III, 57]. The passage is based upon the Shih-chi, loc. cit., the celebrated address to the Throne of K'ung Chin and Tung-kuo Hsien-yang in advocacy of the state control of salt and iron. The memorial of these two former industrialists, manufacturers of iron and salt, who now had come to identify their interests with the government as ardent advocates of the new fiscal system, has been translated by Chavannes (Mém. hist., III, 570—571), and by Franke (Staatssozialistische Versuche, 7). Cf. also Gale, Hist. Evidences relating to Early Chinese Public Finance, for the rôle of these persons in establishing the public control of salt and iron at this time. c. Iron implements and soldiers' weapons are important in the service of the Empire and should not be made the gainful business of everybody. Formerly the great families, agressive and powerful, obtained control of the profit of the mountains and sea, mined iron at Shih-ku3 3 , a place-name, "Stone-drums". and smelted it, and manufactured salt. One family would collect a host of over a thousand men, mostly exiles who had gone far4 4 etc. Wang states that crept in due to its similarity in shape to , while is also superfluous. from their native hamlets, abandoning the tombs of their ancestors. Attaching themselves to a great house and collecting in the midst of mountain fastnesses and barren marshes, they made wickedness and counterfeiting their business, seeking to build up the power of their clique. Their readiness to do evil was also great. Now since the road of recommending capable men has been opened wide, by a careful selection of the supervising officers, restoring peace to the people does not wait on the abolition of the salt and iron monopoly. d. The Literati: What the commander at Shan-shui said was to the benefit5 5 : "profit and power". of the administration at the time; but all these artifices are not to be continued interminably, for generation after generation. 36 This is not the way of an enlightened Ruler in administering the country and patronizing the people. It is said in the Odes: "Alas! our formers of plans Do not take the ancients for their pattern, And do not regulate them by great principles. They only hearken to shallow words. . . ."1 1 Shih-ching, II. v. I. 4 (Hsiao Ya, Ode ), Legge's translation. The poet here slashes at those who are not in accord with the Kingly Way, but are skillful at2 2 , i.e., clever at doing [the things which bring them power and profit]. power and profit. The Emperor Wu3 3 , the Han Emperor (140—86 B.C.) whose reign of fifty-four years is renowned in the military annals of the Chinese Empire. put down the nine barbarian tribes and pacified the hundred Yüeh,4 4 . repeatedly raising armies. As grain was insufficient, he established officers in charge of the fields to procure money flowing into the grain-dispatching office5 5 . to tide over the crisis when food supplies were not being delivered. Now Your Majesty succeeds to a task of great merit in nourishing the burdened and wearied people. This is a time of using thin gruel!6 6 chou chu: "hard times". e. The high officers of state should bethink themselves as to how to pacify and bring together the people, attain profitable ends and abolish evils. They should help the Enlightened Lord7 7 , the Emperor, a term favored by the Legalists. with their benevolence and righteousness and prepare ways of benefiting his Vast Heritage.8 8 : restore and enrich the Empire. The Enlightened Lord came to the throne more than six years ago.9 9 This indicates the time of the debate, equivalent to 81 B.C. See Introduction. Among the high officials there is no one who has yet demanded that unnecessary offices be abolished and profiteers be dismissed. While others have left the matter in abeyance too long, the people have fixed their hope on the Emperor. Proclaiming Your holy virtue and showing forth Your brilliance, Your Majesty has commanded the worthies and the learned from 37 the provinces and demesnes to come up post-haste at public expense1 1 . The latter may be taken also as "central depot", "capital", as well as an office in charge of memorials, rescripts, etc., where persons awaiting Imperial orders were boarded temporarily. to discuss the ways of the Five Emperors and the Three Kings,2 2 : the five legendary Emperors of remote antiquity, T'ai Hao , Yen Ti , Huang Ti , Shao Hao and Chuan Hsü ; the three Kings, traditional founders of the Hsia, Shang and Chou dynasties. and the principles of the Six Arts.3 3 ceremonial observances, music, archery, charioteering, writing, mathematics. We have set forth the difference between peace and danger, profit and harm, clearly and fully4 4 , lit. "brilliantly". according to our ideas. Now the high officers of the state have made great argument without arriving at a decision. This is what is called sticking to trifles and ignoring the main body, clinging to small advantages and forgetting greater advantages. f. The Lord Grand Secretary: Within the universe the swallows and sparrows know nothing of the distance from earth to heaven; the frogs in a well know nothing of the vastness of rivers and seas; poverty stricken bumpkins and their stupid wives know nothing of the cares of statecraft. Peddlers with packs on their backs know nothing of the wealth of I Tun.5 5 . The former Emperor,6 6 Han Wu Ti, the Military Emperor, cf. note supra. pondering on the profit to be got from foreign countries, estimated the opposing forces of the barbarians as weak and easily overwhelmed. Exerting himself but little, his achievement was great; and the result was that by availing himself of circumstances7 7 , an expression employed by the fa-chia writers in this sense. Cf. ch. VII. he made himself master of the four I.8 8 : barbarian tribes. Territories from the mountain slopes to the shores of the sea were brought within the Great Wall. He opened roads into the country of the Hsiung Nu beyond the River on the northern boundary. The task is not yet completed. After Wên Wang9 9 . received the mandate to attack Ch'ung,10 10 . and built a 38 city at Fêng,1 1 . Wu Wang2 2 . succeeded him and carrying his corpse on the march,3 3 is not to be taken literally. The Shih-chi, ch. IV, relates how Wu Wang made a tablet of wood representing his ancestor Wên Wang and had it carried on a chariot in the centre of his army. Chavannes, Mém. hist., I, 165, note 1 conquered Shang, captured Chou,4 4 . and built up a kingly heritage. Ts'ao Mo, despite the humiliation of three defeats, recovered the lost territory. Kuan Chung, though bearing on his shoulders the complicated affairs of his age, established the glory of the Hegemony.5 5 Ts'ao Mo , Kuan Chung . For these personages and the episodes referred to, see the glossary. Thus we see that those of great determination ignore small things, and those who employ exceptional measures6 6 , another fa chia term. Cf. ch. VII. suited to the circumstances, differ from the commonplace. Those in office think to emulate the plans of the tutor Wang7 7 This is evidently who was counsellor to both Wên Wang and Wu Wang. See Giles, Biog. Dict., No. 1862. and complete the task of the late Emperor. Their aim is to destroy the barbarian Hu and Hê8 8 : barbarian tribes. Maspero, who characterizes early China as "un îlot civilisé au milieu des barbares", has assembled the notices of the aboriginal tribes China in his study, "Les origines de la civilization chinoise", in Annales de Géogr., 1926, 138—142. (See also La Chine Antique, 5—11). and cut off the chiefs of the Hsiung Nu. Therefore they have no time for deliberations behind closed doors, and recording the discussions of bigoted Confucianists.9 9 is here rendered "Confucianist", a term which found its own special definition in the Han dynasty. It cannot, however, have obtained at this time the precision attached to the later Confucianist school, for, as has been indicated (see Introduction), the Literati are under influences which can be associated with both the Legalist and Taoist schools. It would seem to mean firstly "a scholar", "a man of learning"; "a ju is said to be one who understands heaven, earth and man", said Yang-tz? . The ju chia are those who make use of the six classics , who make benevolence and righteousness their end, who pattern after Yao and Shun, and Wên and Wu, and who follow Chung Ni as their master. Cf., sub , the Ch'ien-han-shu, XXX. g. The Literati: The swallows and sparrows on leaving their 39 nests for the sky have their troubles from eagles and hawks; the frogs in the wells on leaving their habitations have worries from snakes and rats. What if they should soar a thousand cubits or swim in the four seas? Their disaster would be great. This is how Li Ss?1 1 . broke his wings and Chao Kao2 2 . drowned in the deep. We have heard that Wên and Wu3 3 . received the mandate to punish the unrighteous in order to bring peace to the nobles and ministers; we have not heard of ruining all the Chinese people that warfare be carried on against the I and the Ti.4 4 . Formerly the Ch'in5 5 . dynasty frequently raised the forces of the Empire and used them against the Hu and Yüeh.6 6 . With the use to exhaustion of the wealth of the Empire they could not achieve success. Moreover a million expeditionaries were used for one fellow's affair. This is universally known. Furthermore, much fighting overburdens the people; long campaigns ruin the soldiers. This is the grievance of the people and the concern of your "bigoted Confucianists".</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VII IN CRITICISM OF SHANG YANG1 1 . Biographies of the historical character, known also as Kung-sun Yang or Yang of Wei , are found in the Chan-kuo-ts'ê, ch. 7 (Ch'in-ts'ê), in the Lü-shih-ch'un-ch'iu and in ch. lxviii of the Shih-chi, (trans. by J. J. L. Duyvendak, The Book of Lord Shang, Introduction, ch. I, 8—32). The text of an extant work, the Shang-chün-shu ,. "is a compilation of paragraphs of different styles, some of which are older than the others; the older ones contain probably the mutilated remnants of the original book that has been lost; the later ones date, on the whole, from the third century [B.C.]", (op. cit., 159). The political and social theories of this interesting text, representing the "school of law", fa chia , have been exhaustively treated by Professor Duyvendak in the introduction to his complete translation of the Shang-tz?. a. The Lord Grand Secretary: Formerly when the Lord of Shang was Chancellor of Ch'in he pursued in internal affairs the policy of putting the laws and regulations on a firm basis, of making punishments and penalties harsh and severe, and of ordering government and education. In this no mercy was shown to the criminals and the cheats. In his external policy2 2 Cf. the Shang-chün-shu, para. 22 (held by Duyvendak to be of late origin, op. cit., 150), entitled "External and Internal Affairs" , i.e., war and agriculture. "Of the external affairs of the people, there is nothing more difficult than warfare, . . . . Therefore, he who desires to make his people fight, sees to it that the law is severe; consequently rewards will be numerous, authority will be strict, depraved doctrines will be obstructed . . . . (Duyvendak's trans.)" . . . . . . . . Curiously, Huan K'uan assigns such a policy to "internal affairs" in his passage, evidently employing and as terms applicable to measures taken at the capital and in the provinces, respectively. he managed to obtain profits of a hundred fold and collected taxes on mountains and marshes. The state became rich, the people, strong; weapons and implements were kept ready, complete in every detail, and grain-stores had a surplus. 41 b. As a result of these measures he was able to wage war on enemy countries, to conquer foreign states,1 1 The T'ung-tien reads correctly: "conquer enemy states", e.g., Wei , as in the Shih-chi, ch. LXVIII. to annex new lands, and to extend wide his territories, without overtaxing the people for the support of the army. Thus he could draw constantly upon the resources2 2 . Wang suggests prefixing , following the T'ung-tien, as in the succeeding paragraph f. of the people and the people would not even notice it; he could extend the territory of Ch'in to include all west of the Yellow River3 3 meaning part of the state of Wei , whose armies Shang Yang captured by treachery. Cf. Shih-chi, ch. LXVIII (Duyvendak, op. cit., 21). and the people bore no hardships on this account. c. The profits derived from the salt and iron monopolies serve to relieve the needs of the people in emergencies and to provide sufficient funds for the upkeep of military forces. These measures emphasize conservation and storing up in order to provide for times of scarcity and want. The beneficiaries are many; the State profits thereby and no harm is caused to the masses. Where are those hardships of the common people which cause you so much worry? d. The Literati: At the time4 4 . Wang suggests . Wên Ti (179—156 B. C.), one of the "model Emperors" of the Literati. of Wên Ti was there not no profit from salt and iron and was not the nation prosperous? Now we have this system and the people are in dire circumstances. We fail yet to see how profitabe is this "profit" [of which you speak], but we see clearly the harm it does.5 5 The T'ung-tien omits the and inserts before . Profit, moreover, does not fall from Heaven, nor does it spring forth from the Earth; it is derived entirely from the people. To call it hundredfold is a mistake in judgment similar to that of the simpleton who wore his furcoat inside out while carrying wood, hoping to save the fur and not realizing that the hide was being ruined. e. Now, an abundant crop of prunes will cause a decline for the year immediately following; the new grain ripens. at the expense of the old. For Heaven and Earth do not become full at the same 42 time: so much more is this the case with human activities! Profit in one place involves diminution elsewhere just as yin and yang1 1 , : the "negative" and "positive", etc., principles of nature upon which a school of thought, yin-yang-chia, was based. do not radiate at the same time and day and night alternate in length.2 2 . Wang suggests for as in the T'ung-tien. f. When Shang Yang3 3 The Literati refer to the Lord of Shang always as Shang Yang , "Yang of Shang", to show their contempt for his policies. introduced his harsh laws and increased his "profit", the people of Ch'in could not endure life and among themselves wept for Duke Hsiao.4 4 . : Shang Yang's patron, Duke of Ch'in (361—338 B.C.). When Wu Ch'i5 5 : the famous strategist who served Ch'u. increased the army and engaged in a series of conquests, the people of Ch'u were grievously disturbed and among themselves they shed tears for King Tao.6 6 : King of Ch'u (401—381 B.C.). After their death Ch'u's position became more precarious every day, and Ch'in grew weaker and weaker.7 7 A statement historically incorrect, as to Ch'in. So resentment increased with the growth of "profit", and sorrows multiplied with the extension of territory. Where is all that "inexhaustible profit to use8 8 . Cf. note 2, p. 41 supra. without the people noticing it, and the territory extended to include all west of the Yellow River without the people suffering from it?" g. At the present time, as the Government uses in the management of internal affairs Shang Yang's system of registration9 9 I.e., for soldiering, ap. Duyvendak, op. cit., 83, 293, and 295. and abroad Wu Ch'i's methods of war, travellers are harassed on the road and the residents are suffering from want in their homes, while old women cry bitterly and grieving maidens moan. Even if we, the Literati, try not to worry, we cannot help it. h. The Lord Grand Secretary: Ch'in, by employing the Lord of Shang, waxed strong and rich and after his death finally absorbed the Six States and established an empire which lasted to the time of the Second Emperor, when corupt ministers usurped power and 43 ruled arbitrarily.1 1 Ch'u , Ch'i , Yen , Han , Wei , Chao , the Six States. The Second Emperor is Erh-shih-huang-ti with whom the Ch'in dynasty closed; and "corrupt ministers" include particularly the eunuch Chao Kao , mentioned below. The public good and justice were lost sight of, the feudal lords rebelled and broke out of control, and the dynasty finally went to its ruin. Why, as the Spring and Autumn says, should we mention the death of Chai Chung?2 2 . Not from the Ch'un-ch'iu but the Kung-yang Comm., Huan Kung XV. "(Confucius) does not mention Chai Chung's death, he is indifferent to the statesman's fate ." See glossary. A good singer makes men (able) to follow his notes;3 3 This sentence occurs in the Li-chi, , with for our text's . Legge, Sacred Books, v. 28, p. 87. a talented artist causes others to continue his work; fitting the rim of a cart wheel, depends upon the training of an apprentice.4 4 A puzzling passage, but the translation given appears to continue the sense of the preceding passages. Chang quotes in explanation Huan-nan-tz?, ch. : If one could not change what had been done in ancient times ( ), then the would still be even now without a rim. The achievements of Chou virtue depended upon the strength of Chou Kung.5 5 . Though there may be the preliminary draft of P'i Shên, but none of the embellishment of Tz?-ch'an,6 6 . The phrases are from Lun-yü, XIV, x. and though there may be the traced lines of Wên and Wu,7 7 . but no boring and no handle of Chou8 8 , Duke of Chou. and Lü,9 9 , known as Lü Shang , or , preceptor of Wên and Wu. then the work will not be successfully completed. Now you blame Shang Yang for the work of Chao Kao10 10 . who brought Ch'in to ruin. It is just like blaming I Yin11 11 . for the disruption of the Yin12 12 . Empire by Ch'ung-hu.13 13 . i. The Literati: An expert with the chisel can make a perfect 44 round hole without exerting himself. An expert in laying foundations can reach a considerable height without the work collapsing. I Yin took the principles of Yao and Shun as the foundation of the Yin Empire, and for countless generations descendants of the founder occupied the throne in an unbroken line. Shang Yang made heavy punishments and harsh laws the foundation of the Ch'in state, and within two generations Ch'in lost the Empire. Not satisfied with the already severe and inhuman laws, he created also the system of mutual responsibility, devised an organization of spying and accusation and increased bodily punishments.1 1 , thus more detailed than in the extant biographical sketches. Huan K'uan appears to have made use of tradition, or of a biography now lost. The people were terrorized, not knowing even where to place their hands and feet. Not satisfied with the already exacting and numerous taxes and levies, he established abroad prohibitions on the resources of the mountains and seas and set up a hundredfold profit in the interior,2 2 . The distinction here of Shang Yang's measures as "abroad" and "in the interior", is indicated in note 2, p. 40, supra, the country and the capital. while the people had no means to express their opinion. The worship of profit and neglect of rectitude, the high regard for might and emphasis on merit, resulted indeed in extension of territory and acquisition of land, but it was just like the case of a man snffering from dropsy and being given water which only increases his illness. [The Lord Grand Secretary] knows well how Shang Yang laid the beginnings of an Empire for Ch'in but does not know how he caused its downfall. With a bore pierced in a wild and uncertain manner,3 3 The commentators take as , "all askew". Kung Shu-tz?4 4 . himself would be unable to fit the handle. With a panful of earth for his foundation, the most skillful builder cannot reach any height. They would be like autumn weeds which when touched by the frost wither and fall at the first encounter with the wind. What can ten Tz?-ch'an's5 5 . do then? So, Pien Ch'iao6 6 , the physician. cannot cover white bones with flesh, nor can Wei 45 Tz?1 1 and Chi Tz?2 2 . preserve a country predestined to ruin. j. The Lord Grand Secretary: To talk is easy, but to act is difficult. So the ancient worthies would stick to the realities and exert their efforts and would banish the mere exhibition of empty learning. Formerly, the Lord of Shang intelligently pursued the policy of encouragement of proper activities and restraining the improper.3 3 , the title of one of the books of the Shang-tz? (7th), which Ss?-ma Ch'ien states that he read (Shih-chi LXVIII). Duyvendak is of the opinion that, while the expression occurs in para. 7, this title belonged originally to para. 8 "where the terms are used in a far more typical sense of `opening', k'ai, only one gate to riches and honour, i.e., agriculture and warfare, and by `closing', sai, all other gates". Loc. cit., 149. "Policy" here used is also a special expression of the legalist school to which the Shang-tz? belongs. He made use of the powers in the contemporaneous world for the advancement of Ch'in, sought profit and achieved success; therefore he was victorious in every battle and always captured his object of attack, absorbing his nearest opponents and crushing the distant. He took advantage of Yen and Chao4 4 . and terrorized Ch'i and Ch'u.5 5 . The feudal lords, gathering up their skirts, faced westward and followed Ch'in's leadership. After him came Mêng T'ien6 6 . who led armies against the barbarian Hu, ejecting them from their lands to the extent of a thousand li and going as far as the north side of the Yellow River, all that as easily as breaking rotten wood or destroying decayed matter. How, may I ask? — by virtue of the plans of the Lord of Shang, handed down, brought to perfection and constantly followed. Every undertaking brought advantage and every move had its reward as a consequence of this. Accumulation, storing up, and shrewd calculations are the means of strengthening a state. To slacken and disperse [authority], therefore, and leaving things to the people, that is not yet having conceived a Great Scheme and walking in a Great Path. k. The Literati: Shang Yang's policy of "encouragement and restraint" was by no means unsuccessful. Mêng T'ien's pushing back the northern barbarians a thousand li is certainly an achievement. That awe of them over-spread the Empire proves indeed that they 46 were strong; and that the feudal lords submitted to their dictates and faced westward is in itself a record of success. Yet all these facts were the cause of Ch'in's fall. Shang Yang with his opportunist and calculating policy1 1 , the fa chia terms. jeopardized the Ch'in state, while Mêng T'ien by the acquisition of a thousand miles of territory brought about the fall of the house of Ch'in. These two men recognized advantage but not peril, knew well how to advance, but not the way of retreat. So they themselves died and their adherents were defeated. This is what we call the wisdom of a warped mind2 2 : lit., "bound" and "strips of dried meat", evidently an opprobrious epithet. and the scheme of a fool. Now, may we ask, where is the Great Path in this? Thus as the saying goes: Narrow-minded men at first may. unite their efforts but will disagree afterwards. Though at the start they may ride [proudly] on horseback, they will end in weeping tears of blood. l. The Lord Grand Secretary: Handsome persons are deeply envied by the ugly and deformed. Scholars of character and wisdom are hated by the unsuccessful. Thus Shang-kuan,3 3 . the Minister, belittled Ch'ü Yüan4 4 . before Ch'ing Hsiang,5 5 . and Kung-po Liao calumnied Tz? Lu before Chi Sun.6 6 , from Lun-yü, XIV, xxxviii. m. Now the Lord of Shang rose from obscurity7 7 , not from the "hemp-clothed" commoners, as he was of noble descent, as the name Kung-sun () Yang indicates. Cf. Shih-chi, ch. LXVIII. The particulars here given appear generally in the various biographies, cf. Duyvendak, op. cit., 23, text and note 1. and came from Wei to Ch'in.8 8 . A year afterwards he was made Chancellor. He reformed the laws, made clear the instructions and the people of Ch'in became well disciplined. As a result, the mobilization of troops brought always new additions to the territory, and peace a constant increase in wealth. Duke Hsiao,9 9 . greatly pleased with him, gave him Shang10 10 . as a fief and as a reward five hundred li of territory. His achievements were as enduring as the mountains, while his fame passed on to posterity. Average people cannot achieve the 47 like, so they envy his ability and find fault with his accomplishments. n. The Literati: The noble man enters into a career always with Principle as his guide and retires without failing in his duty. High in the social scale, he is not overbearing; active, he is not boastful; when occupying an honorable position, he is circumspect in his conduct; and when his achievements are great, he is still compliant in his measures. Therefore, the common man does not envy his ability, and his contemporaries begrudge him not his acquisitions. o. Now Shang Yang abandoned Principle and became an opportunist;1 1 , again the term favored by the fa chia writers: "the practice of weighing out things against each other" (Duyvendak, op. cit., 100). The estimation of Shang Yang here, though not in the same words, agrees with Ss?-ma Ch'ien's characterization (Shih-chi, ch. LXVIII): . The Lord of Shang was naturally, in character, a hard and cruel man . . . . after having succeeded in obtaining employment through the introduction of a favorite, he punished Prince Ch'ien, betrayed the Wei general, Ang, and did not follow the advice of Chao Liang, all of which facts show clearly that the Lord of Shang was a man of little favour . . . . There is reason enough why he should have finally left a bad reputation in Ch'in. (Duyvendak's translation, op cit., 30—31). discarded Virtue and relied upon might; established harsh laws and increased punishments, making oppression and tyranny the order of the day. He cheated his friends to accomplish his ambition, punished members of the ducal house to make his authority felt. He had no compassion for the people, nor did he show any faith in his relations with the feudal princes. Individuals had nothing but hate for him, families nothing but enmity. Though he obtained success and was ennobled, it was as if he had eaten poisoned meat: he may have felt pleased and satiated but soon suffered from his mistake. p. Su Ch'in2 2 . Cf. Maspero, La Chine Antique, 588. . formed horizontal and divised vertical alliances and united the Six States. This task was indeed great! Chieh and Chou3 are mentioned together with Yao and Shun4 4 . and are not forgotten 48 to the present day. Their name is lasting indeed! Yet wrong-doing being unquestionably dishonorable, their deeds should not lightly be esteemed nor should their name lightly be transmitted. q. The Lord Grand Secretary: White cannot hold its own in the presence of black; a Worthy or a Sage1 1 . Chang curiously reverses the usual order of these words. cannot order things as he wishes in an age of anarchy. Thus, Chi Tz? suffered imprisonment and Pi Kan2 2 . was tortured. Wu Yuan3 3 . was Chancellor to Ho Lü4 4 . and made him Protector, but Fu-ch'ai5 5 . unjustly exiled and then killed him. Yo I6 6 . was a trusted servant and served well King Chao of Yen7 7 . yet he was suspected of treason by King Hui.8 8 . These ministers were to the last blameless in order to achieve fame but met the neglect of the contemporary rulers. Chung, the Minister,9 9 . was the right hand of the King of Yüeh10 10 . and designed deep schemes for him which culminated in the capture of the powerful state of Wu11 11 . and the occupation of the lands of the Eastern Aborigines;12 12 . he finally was presented with the `Shu-lou'13 13 , cf. the Tz'?-yüan. sword and committed suicide. Proud princes who turn their backs upon compassion and virtue and listen to corrupt whisperings and disregard their accomplishments, are the cause of their downfall. What guilt have these [faithful ministers]? r. The Literati: That Pi Kan had his heart cut out, and that Tz?-hsü's14 14 Wu Juan. body was thrown into the river in a leather sack, was not due to a light-hearted antagonizing of the princes at their own peril, or to obstinate admonishments to promote their fame, but the loyalty and sincerity in their distressed hearts moved them from within and they forgot the danger appearing from without. Their only aim was to assist their Prince and save their people, and they died without resentment. A true gentleman can do what is right but can not ward off evil. Though he may meet with torture and execution, it is not his fault. Therefore when Pi Kan died the people of Yin clamored, and when Tz?-hsü died the people of Wu sorrowed. 49 s. Now the people of Ch'in hated the laws of Shang Yang more fiercely than they did their personal enemies. So on the day of the death of Duke Hsiao [his protector], they rose as one man and attacked him; east, west, north or south he found no place to flee. Looking up to heaven he said with a sigh, "Alas! Has the evil of my policy reached such an extreme?"1 1 . Cf. Ss?-ma Ch'ien's text: , "Alas, that the worthlessness of the law should reach such a point" (Duyvendak's translation, op. cit., 29). Finally his body was torn apart by chariots, his kinsmen exterminated. An object of mockery to the whole Empire, this man was killed by himself, not by others.2 2 Only the traditional activities and policies of one of early China's greatest administrators are discussed in this chapter. Unfortunately, no direct citations from the work associated with Shang Yang's name are given, which might have thrown light on the value of the modern text. The interest of the chapter lies, however, in its emphasis (within the vast display of learning indulged in by the interlocutors) of the unpopularity of the social and economic theories of the School of Law with the "Confucianists" of Han times; and equally, the ardent advocacy of many of the fa chia policies by the Han administrators is disclosed. Cf. Duyvendak, op. cit., 126 seq., on the influence of the School of Law in the establishment of the Han regime.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER VIII CH'AO TS'O1 1 , held to be an adherent of Shang Yang's school (Duyvendak, Book of Lord Shang, 54). He brought on a grave rebellion of the feudatories against his Imperial patron, Ching Ti (156—140 B.C.), through ill-conceived advice to reduce their power. To satisfy the animosity of the nobles, he was made the scapegoat and was executed. Cf. Shih-chi, chaps. XI, XXIII, (Chavannes, Mém. hist., II, 499, 509; III, 210—11), and CI, where his biography appears. It would seem, though the argument is somewhat obscure and must be largely inferred from the several historical allusions employed by the disputants, that the Lord High Secretary lays the blame for Ch'ao Ts'o's death on the Scholars; while the Literati accuse Ch'ao Ts'o of having been too sweeping in his punishment of the feudal princes. Perhaps the fact that it was recent history (122 B.C.) induced the Literati to express their opinion in a rather guarded manner. a. The Lord Grand Secretary: This is the guiding principle of the Spring and Autumn that there should be no designs2 2 . Chang quotes Yen Shih-ku's explanation of as "to have designs upon", . The exact quotation occurs in the Kung-yang Chuan, Chao , I. Cf. Tz'?-yüan, sub , and K'ang Hsi Tz?-tien, the latter assigning the quotation to op. cit., Chuang , XXXII. made against Prince or Parent and those guilty of such designs must be punished by death.3 3 This dogmatic interpretation of the Ch'un-ch'iu , in a work of the first half of the century before the Christian era, is of special interest. The critical school of K'ang Yu-wei asserted that the great commentary on the Ch'un-ch'iu, the Tso-chuan , was specially composed from earlier works by Liu Hsin at the beginning of the Christian era, to make manifest that the venerated chronicle, whose entries contain numerous accounts of murders and usurpations in the feudal states, did not necessarily reprobate regicide and usurpation. Liu Hsin's purpose, according to K'ang, was to vindicate his patron, Wang Mang , who had obtained the throne through such measures. Karlgren argues against such a theory (cf. On the Authenticity of the Tso chuan, 1926). The Ch'un-ch'iu has been subjected to a renewed examination by Franke in Studien zur Geschichte des Konfuzianischen Dogmas und der chinesischen Staats-religion: Das Problem des Tsch'un-ts'iu und Tung Tschung-schu's Tsch'un-ts'iu-fan-lu (1920). There is, therefore, no greater crime for a minister than the assassination of his prince, and no greater crime 51 for a son than the murder of his father.1 1 A possible reference to the Lun-yü, XI, xxiii, 6, where regicide and parricide are under discussion. Cf. Soothill, Analects, 540, note. It is but recently that the princes of Huai Nan and Hêng Shan,2 2 , who is described as gathering about him a heterogeneous group of scholars. With the Prince of Hêng Shan , he rebelled against the Han house, and ultimately committed suicide (122 B.C.). Cf. Wieger, Textes historiques (ap. Ch'ien-han-shu), I, 468—9. encouraging literary studies, invited footloose scholars from the four corners of the Empire. The Confucianists and Mihists from east of the mountains3 3 . all congregated betwixt the Chiang and the Huai,4 4 (Yangtz?) and (Huai) rivers. expounding, arguing, compiling and epitomizing, producing books by the score. Yet finally we saw these princes discarding loyalty, turning to rebellious ways, planning sedition, and perishing the death of criminals together with all their kith and kin. Thus Ch'ao Ts'o was led5 5 . It was the activities of the seditious scholars that led Ch'ao Ts'o to adopt his vigorous policy of centralization. to change the laws and alter customs,6 6 . The Shih-chi, ch. CI, has . disregard precedent and rule, in his attempt to curb the hereditary houses7 7 should read . The substitution crept in under the influence of the preceding . and curtail the appanages of the feudal lords, until outlying vassals refused allegiance and the royal flesh and blood threw off the bond of consanguinity. Long did Wu and Ch'u8 8 . nourish their grievances — beheaded was Ch'ao Ts'o in the Eastern Market, sacrificed for the purpose of quieting the soldiers of the army and placating the nobles. Now tell me, pray, who was his real murderer? b. The Literati: Confucius would not drink of the outflow at "Robber's Spring"; Tsêng Tz? would not enter the hamlet of "Mother Surpassed".9 9 Cf. ch. XVI of the Shuo-yüan of Liu Hsiang (B.C. 80—9) where the same passage indicates the fastidiousness of the two ancients regarding improper names. These mere names they hated; how much more would they shrink from doing anything disloyal or unfilial? Thus Confucius 52 bathed himself and went to Court where he petitioned Duke Ai,1 1 . To obtain vengeance for the murder of Duke Chien of Ch'i . Lun-yü, XIV, xxii. and although Ch'ên Wên Tz? held a fief of ten chariots he abandoned all and left the country.2 2 When Ts'ui Tz? put to death Duke Chuang of Ch'i . Lun-yü, V, xviii. The superior man, says the Chuan,3 3 The quotation occurs substantially in the Li-chi, , para. 44. may be exalted and may be humbled; he may undergo punishment and be executed; but never can he be forced to become seditious. Now a man may have polished manners and yet be empty in substance; he may offer lip-service at the shrine of culture but in his conduct never follow its paths. Let him, then, keep company with knaves, for he is nothing short of that; he is not to be tolerated in the precincts of gentlemen. The Spring and Autumn never countenanced opposing the many in behalf of the few. The justice of extreme penalties has its limitations; it should not involve the victimizing of others. Thus when Shun was forced to resort to executions, he executed but Kun, the chief criminal, just as when he made rewards by promotion he chose Yü as the worthiest of all.4 4 Shun executed Kun , father of Yü , for failure to curb the waters of the great flood, a task accomplished by Yü, as recorded in the Shu-ching. If all uncarved precious stones were discarded because of some flaw found in the crown jewels,5 5 , "crown jewel" of Lu. or all members of a group were implicated in the guilt of one individual, there would remain in the whole world not a single precious jewel and not a single trustworthy knight. Master Ch'ao claimed that the feudal lords had waxed strong and rich on their estates and had become so proud and extravagant that they might in time of crisis unite their forces with sinister designs. So for a fault of Wu6 6 . he decimated Kuei Chi,7 7 . for the crime of Ch'u8 8 . he deprived of power Tung Hai9 9 . so that he might preserve the balance of power and divide their authority; he planned for generations 53 to come. Just as Hsien Kao1 1 , an example of disinterested loyalty. cheated Ch'in2 2 . but kept faith with Chêng,3 3 . Master Ch'ao was faithful to Han and thus came to be an enemy to the princes. Any man serving as minister must be ready to die for his prince in the service of his state. It was thus that Hsieh Yang4 4 , who, despite all pressure brought to bear, remained faithful to his Sovereign. The anecdote is in the Tso-chuan, Hsüan , XV, (Legge, Chi. Classics, V, i, 327). requited himself fully before Chin5 5 by slighting the barbarian power of Ching.6 6 , i. e. Ch'u .</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER IX TAUNTING THE PUISSANT a. The Lord Grand Secretary: Let us consider for a moment the Imperial riches of such places as Chü-ch'ü of Yüeh, Yün-mêng of Ch'u, Ch`ü-yeh of Sung, and Mêng-chu of Ch'i;1 1 . These famous "reservations" changed hands frequently during the feudal period. Both Chang and Wang discuss their exact locations. See glossary. they are all of substance worthy of a Lord Protector or a King. It is when he has them consolidated and well guarded2 2 : in Chang's text, . that the Ruler of Men grows strong; should he fail to put any restrictions upon their use, he will speedily go to his ruin. Thus when the state of Ch'i3 3 . gave away its vitals to private individuals, its vassal houses grew powerful beyond control, just as the branches of a tree when they become too big break the main trunk, all because the vassal houses succeeded in laying their hands upon the riches of the ocean and obtained control of the profits derived from fisheries and salt beds. They were now in position to use their accumulated strength in order to manipulate the masses, and their bounties to distribute doles to the plebs. As a consequence Ch'i, divided against itself, became dependent of outside powers; sovereign authority shifted to the ministers and the administration was cast down into the hands of the vassal clans; the ducal house was humiliated, while the patrician family of T'ien4 4 . waxed strong. Their caravans and cargoes5 5 . The first compound refers to land transportation. Cf. Chavannes, Mém. hist., III, 562, "ils avaient des convois de transport d'une centaine de chars". often reached three thousand cartloads! All this serves to prove that once you let go of the root, nothing can save for you the branches. b. At the present time our natural resources contained in mountains, 55 rivers, seas and lakes are not limited to Yün-mêng and Mêng-chu. Metallurgists and brine-boilers always choose for their activities the seclusion of sombre valleys, seldom visited by people. As they craftily and cunningly ply their trade betwixt mountain and sea, there is danger that great evils might arise from this situation. With these people riding on prosperity, they dispel simplicity and increase dishonest practices,1 1 . Lu suggests reading for . with the result that few will be those who hold in honor fundamental occupations. K'ung Chin and Hsien-yang,2 2 Cf. p. 2, note 1; p. 35, note 2. Chang omits [Tung-Kuo] Hsien-yang: "K'ung Chin and others." Commissioners of Salt and Iron for the Exchequer, proposed to the government, therefore, that the people be summoned to provide for the necessary expenses themselves to boil salt with implements supplied by the authorities, in order to bar the road to shifty and dishonest practices. You can see from that how profound was the aim of the prohibitory laws and also how far-sighted the intent of the officials. c. The Literati: Far-sighted and far-reaching in intent is your policy but contiguous with profit for powerful families. The aim of your prohibitory laws is profound indeed, but manifestly leading you into the path of wild extravagance. Since the establishment of the Profit-and-Loss System and the initiation of the Three Enterprises,3 3 . The salt monopoly, the iron monopoly, and the liquor excise are apparently meant. Cf. p. 2, notes 1 and 2. For "Profit-and-Loss System", cf. p. 10, note 4, . the privileged families throng the streets like drifting clouds, the hubs of their chariots knocking against one another on the road. Violating all public laws, they promote but their own interests; sitting astride mountains and marshes and monopolizing all offices and markets, they present a far greater problem than the feudal possessors of fisheries and salt-beds. They hold the state authority and travel around the Empire. This is more than the influence of T'ien Ch'ang4 4 . and the power of the feudal ministers.5 5 . Cf. Lun-yü, XVI, ii, ". . . When a minister's minister holds command in the kingdom it is rare if it be not lost within three generations." 56 Their prestige is higher than that of the Six Ministers1 1 See p. 31, note 5. and their wealth double that of T'ao and Wei.2 2 . In the style of their chariots and their dress they usurp the prerogatives of dukes or kings; their palaces and mansions overstep the limits prescribed by the regulations; they combine whole rows of dwellings, cutting off thoroughfares and alleys. They build intersecting galleries to accommodate themselves in their strolls and sight-seeing tours; dig ponds and build winding lanes for their parties de plaisir: they fish along deep water-courses, unleash their hounds at fleeting hare and fierce wolf, revel in feats of strength, football3 3 Cf. Ch'ien-han-shu, XXX, for a work on football, , listed under the military writers. games and cock-fighting. The singing-girls of Chung-shan4 4 . Cf. Tz'?-yüan. play their inflammatory music4 4 . Cf. Tz'?-yüan. on the balconies of their halls, while the drums beat and spirited dancing6 6 . Chang reads , apparently "Ss?-ch'uan dancing". Men from the two provinces of Pa and Yü were famous for their dancing skill. is going on below. Their wives and daughters dress only in the finest silks and their maids and concubines trail trains of the finest linen.7 7 in the sense of trail or drag along. Cf. Shih-ching, T'ang Fêng, ode : You have suits of robes, but you will not wear them (Legge, Chí. Classics, vol. IV, i, 176, note). Their sons and grandsons ride out with long retinues of chariots and horsemen; in and out they ride to the hunt and display their skill in handling net and dart.8 8 : small net for catching birds, and an arrow propelled by a thong. The result is that we see the farmer abandoning his plough and toiling no more; the people becoming vagabonds9 9 , literally, "the people melt away like ice". or growing idle—and why? Because while they toil, others reap the fruit of their labor. Wasters continue to compete with each other, unceasingly trying to reach higher levels of extravagance. This is the only explanation for the people increasing in dishonest practices and the dwindling number of those who turn to fundamental occupations. 5 Play the ("rippling" ) Chih note. Chih corresponds to Summer and Fire. 57 d. The Lord Grand Secretary: That an exalted office is synonymous with handsome emolument is as natural as a sturdy root producing luxuriant branches. Therefore, Wên Wang's sons and grandsons received fiefs because of their father's virtue, and Po Ch'in1 1 . became rich because of Chou Kung's having been Chancellor of the realm. Sons achieve prestige when their fathers hold exalted positions, just as fish wax big in extensive waters, for as the Chuan says, Rivers and seas can fatten a thousand li of land.2 2 Kung-yang Chuan, Duke Hsi, , XXXI. If great virtue can extend to the Four Seas, so much more does it benefit one's own family! Thus when the husband is exalted at court, the wife is honored in the home. To speak of riches as passably fine3 3 . Lun-yü, XIII, viii: The Master said of Ching . . . when he had amassed plenty he called it "Passably fine" (Soothill's trans.). was a principle with the Ancients. The Prince while not different from other men, says Mencius, is what he is chiefly because of his station.4 4 Apparently based on Mencius, VII, i, xxxvi, 1 and 2: Great is the influence of position . . . The residence [etc.] . . . of the king's son are the same as those of other men. That he looks so is occasioned by his position (Legge's trans.). But for the rank and file of the people to aspire to the station of the scions of high ministers is just as preposterous as for a cripple to wish to overtake Lou Chi.5 5 . Is it not rather a vain hope to long for a treasure of a thousand pieces of gold with not a farthing of capital? e. The Literati: Even in their days of obscurity as simple commoners Yü and Chi6 6 . would regard themselves responsible for every luckless person7 7 . in the Empire, as if it were they who had pushed him into the pit of distress. They arose, therefore, and assisted Yao in subduing the flood, regulating the land, and teaching the people the agricultural arts. Such was the heavy responsibility that they took upon themselves for the sake of the whole world. How can you say that they sought appointments for the mere support of their families? Now, he who feeds upon the labor of ten thousand men, should take upon himself their cares and shoulder their burdens. Whether it is a man losing his employment or an official neglecting his duty, it should be alike a load on a minister. Thus 58 the gentleman in serving his government carries out his duty but does not take delight in his station. The salary he receives is meant to benefit the worthy, not for him to pocket profits; he should not obscure worth when he sees it, and use his appointments exclusively for himself. Thus did Kung-shu1 1 . earn the title of "The Cultured" and Wei Ch'êng Tz?2 2 . become known as "The Worthy"; thus Chou first perfected his virtue and then enfeoffed his descendants — in this way his action could never be considered as partizan.3 3 Lu suggests: `and the world [ to be inserted] did not consider him partizan'. Thus Chou Kung completed his work and then only accepted his fief—in this way he could never be considered by the world as being covetous. f. But how different is the situation now! Relatives push each other to the front; partizan cliques recommend one another. When the father is exalted in his position, the son becomes overweening at home; when the husband is honored at the court, the wife pushes her calls4 4 : visits her superiors. into the higher social circles. You have the wealth of Chou Kung without possessing his virtue, and the extravagance of Kuan Chung without his achievements. No wonder that even paupers and cripples entertain vain hopes of quickening their pace.</field>

Mencius I, i, iii, 4, . of worries of incumbents in office, incommensurable with yours, critical bystanders? Here we sit now in the heart of a mighty Empire, with all the outlying states looking up to us for the solution of crucial domestic and foreign problems.3 3 . Our minds are in a state of watchful tension, as if we were crossing a great waterway4 4 , a common figure in the I-ching, (cf., e.g. hexagrams, 5, 6, 26, 27 et al.). "Watchful tension", , cf. I-ching, 31. in the face of a gale, with no haven yet in sight. Thus day and night we ponder and worry over the expenditure of this great Commonwealth, forgetting sleep while in bed and oblivious of food when hungry. Statistical tables5 5 . never depart from our presence; we ransack our minds ever searching to solve a myriad problems. Our assistants are, of course, of mediocre ability and not fit for consultation! We struggle alone with great principles and our thoughts have turned to the Scholars with hope and expectation, as to some Duke Chou or Duke Shao,6 6 . and we crave their bounties as if from some Tz?-kao.7 7 Chang, quoting the Kao-shih Chuan , attempts to identify Tz?-kao with , a worthy of high antiquity. Lu's note points out that the eference is to Shên Chu-liang. While our Secretariat manages affairs, year after year a search is made throughout 60 the provinces and demesnes for men of high integrity, and talented and worthy scholars are recommended. b. We have now convened with us over sixty of your class, oh Worthies and Literati. You who cherish so the practices of the Six Arts,1 1 Cf. supra, p. 37, note 3. fleet in thought and exhaustive in argument, — you ought now to let out the flood of your light and dispel our ignorance. Come, show to us now how you disparage everything modern, putting all your trust in the past; how you discourse upon Antiquity, with never a reference to present conditions. Is it due to our ideosyncracies that we are unable to recognize a scholar; or is it rather your habit of falsifying truth by slandering ability in your stilted tirades? How difficult indeed it is to find a really worthy scholar! From Ni K'uan of Ch'ien-shêng,2 2 . upon whom was bestowed the hat of a high minister for his studies on the Book of History, down to all the recommended scholars that I have ever seen or heard or as soaring high as recipients of Imperial favor, — none has shown transcendant ability, none has helped the government in solving difficulties, none has had any merit whatever! c. The Literati: When working as a carpenter Shu Tz?3 3 . would first adjust his square and compass, then "handle and hole" would fit each other perfectly; the music-master Kuang,4 4 . when harmonizing the scale, would first regulate his six sharps;5 5 . then only he achieved the perfect blending of the sol-fa.6 6 Literally, the kung and shang , the 1st and 2nd notes of the 5-note musical scale. Our present artificers and mechanics, when unable to fit handle and hole, find fault with the square and compass; and when unable to harmonize the simplest tune, begin to tamper with the time-honored musical scale. No wonder that their handle and hole are all askew and never fit each other, that their music is a cacophony of unsynchronized sounds. Now the real master artist is he who knows how to adjust square and compass as soon as he picks them up; he who knows the musical variations as soon as he begins to blow into the organ-pipe. Next comes he who follows in the beaten path and waits for the right man before starting an 61 innovation. This explains why Chanceller Ts'ao held drinking parties daily, and Lord Ni kept his mouth shut, refusing to speak on anything.1 1 . "Ts'ao Ts'an . . . . consciously practiced the political philosophy of laissez-faire. During his 3 years of Premiership, he was drunk every day, and when his subordinates came to him to make new proposals, he made them drink to intoxication, to prevent them from talking about their new schemes." Cf. Hu Shih, The Establishment of Confucianism as a State Religion, 21. d. Thus, it seems to us, those in charge of important affairs should not allow themselves to be vexed with trifles, for this leads to confusion; while dealing with small details, one should ever be diligent, for laxity leads to negligence. It is he who has a broadly comprehensive grasp of administrative methods that is fit to become a member of the Cabinet, says the Spring and Autumn; but he whose administrative methods are over-inquisitive is only fit to be the most common citizen.2 2 Not found in the Ch'un-ch'iu or its commentaries. Cf. Tao-tê-ching, ch. 58: , "whose administrative methods are over-inquisitive." Now it should be a matter of the gravest concern to ministers of state when the social tenets are not disseminated and propriety and justice do not function. As to files and documents and matters of expediency, this is the business of office assistants. As the Book of History says, In office should be the eminent, the different officers go about their work, the various artisans labor according to season, all working in harmony.3 3 Shu-ching II, iii, ii, 4. Legge translates: "Then men of a thousand () and men of a hundred () will fill the offices of the State; the various ministers will emulate one another; all the officers will accomplish their duties at the proper time" . . . . The end of the sentence is missing in the Yen T'ieh Lun whose is apparently equivalent to the Shu-ching's concluding , "and thus their various duties will be fully accomplished". The former phrase occurs later on in the Shu-ching II, iv, iii, 10, "and all the chiefs of the officers become truly harmonious". That is to say, for every office the right man was secured and every man attended to his business; thus every office was well regulated without confusion arising and every affair was attended to without being neglected. Minor officers should keep strictly to their duties, higher officials should regulate their offices, while ministers of state should only take up general and essential affairs. e. Therefore, for those who know how to employ able men, responsibility is shouldered without laborious effort, but with those 62 who know only how to use their own resources, business is neglected and everything left uncompleted. Duke Huan let Kuan Chung1 1 . be his eyes and ears. Thus the superior man exerts himself in his search for worthy men and takes his rest in employing them—do you see any danger in that? In former days when Chou Kung2 2 . was Chanceller, he was meek and humble, never stingy3 3 , which here is , according to Lu. when patronizing the scholars of the Empire. Therefore, able and distinguished men filled his court, the worthy and wise thronged at his gate. Confucius, a simple commoner without rank or privilege, commanded the following of over seventy talented scholars who were all fit to become high ministers of state to any feudal prince. What could he have done in supporting all the Empire's scholars had he possessed dignity comparable to that of the Three Highest Ministers!4 4 : under the Chou dynasty, the Grand Tutor , Assistant , and Guardian . But you with your superior ministerial rank and handsome salary, you are unable to attract scholars, as you never possessed the secret of promoting the worthy. f. When Yao promoted Shun,5 5 . he treated him as his guest and gave him his daughters in marriage; when Duke Huan promoted Kuan Chung, he likewise treated him as his guest and made him his mentor. For a Son of Heaven to become related by marriage to a commoner—Yao could surely be termed to be on intimate relations with the worthy; for a great prince to appoint as his mentor a commoner—Duke Huan could surely be said to show respect to his guest. This is why worthies flocked to them like a rushing stream and attached themselves to them without hesitation. But in our modern times we look in vain among those in high places for men who would show as much regard for scholars as was exhibited by King Chao of Yen,6 6 . or as much delight in associating with worthies as is depicted in the poem, "With pleased sounds the deer call."7 7 . Cf. Shih-ching, Hsiao Ya, 1st ode, a festal ode, sung at entertainments to the King's ministers and guests from the feudal States. See Legge's translation, Chinese Classics, Vol. IV, Pt. ii, 245. 63 We see you, on the other hand, adopting the ideas of Ts'ang Wên1 1 . Cf. Lun-yü, XV, xiii: "Was not Ts'ang Wên Chung like one who had stolen his office?" remarked the Master. "He knew the superiority of Hui of Liu-hsia yet did not appoint him as a colleague". and Tz?-shu2 2 . Cf. Mencius, II, ii, x, 6: "A strange man was Tsze-shu I. He pushed himself into the service of government . . . ." in ignoring the worthy and envying the able, exalting your own wisdom and belittling the ability of others. Too conceited to ask for advice, too snobbish to befriend the scholars, trying to impress worthy men by your high rank and to intimidate men of scholarly attainment by your high salaries, it is indeed not surprising that you find it so difficult to secure the service of scholars! g. The Lord Grand Secretary, confounded, said nothing while the Worthies drew prolonged sighs. Then advanced one of the Secretaries and addressed them: T'ai Kung,3 3 . as Chancellor to kings Wên and Wu, made them Emperors of the world; Kuan Chung, as Prime Minister to Duke Huan, made his master Lord Protector of the feudal princes. Thus when real worthies obtain high positions they are like dragons plunging into water, or soaring serpents disporting on the clouds. But Master Kung-sun Hung, when acting as Chancellor, lectured his late Majesty upon the Spring and Autumn, and while secure in the position of one of the Three Highest Ministers, and with all the advantages of Dukes Chou and Shao,4 4 . with powers extending over ten thousand li, and with the possibility to set a standard for the whole world, proceeded to establish examples for the Empire to follow by never dressing in two colors and never dining on more than one dish,5 5 . Wang's text has for the last, "never held more than one office". But the same attribute is assigned to Kung-sun Hung in the Shih-chi (cf. Chavannes, Mém. hist., III, 559). The Li-chi, , para. 4, has a similar expression: . all with no noticeable benefit to the administration.6 6 Kung-sun Hung was one of Han Wu Ti's chief ministers. His biography appears in ch. CXII of the Shih-chi. He was noted for his personal frugality and public generosity. The account in this paragraph follows generally the Shih-chi, ch. XXX (cf. Chavannes, Mém. hist., III, 558 seq.). 64 h. Learned doctors such as Chu T'ai and Hsü Yen1 1 . in accordance with an Imperial rescript, and endowed with special powers, rode through all the length and breadth of the Empire, through every province and demesne, making selection among the filial and incorrupt,2 2 . and urging the people of the realm to reform—yet folkways and morality showed no great change for the better. We have seen also recommended scholars of the classes of Worthies, Probi and Literati suddenly raised to high rank and honor, some of them even holding ministerial posts. This is certainly doing more in promoting scholars than king Chao of Yen ever did, and wider employment of the worthies than Wên Wang ever attempted. Yet in spite of all this we never saw anything accomplished by these men. We should say that these worthies could not be exactly described as possessing talents that would lead us to compare them with dragons and soaring serpents; nor were they as commendable as those in whom the poem "With pleased sounds the deer call" took pleasure. i. The Literati: Ice and coals are not kept in the same receptacle, nor can the sun and moon shine side by side. In Kung-sun Hung's time the Ruler of Men was turning his thoughts, and inclining his mind, to deal with the Barbarians on the four borders. Therefore, this was the time when cunning strategic plans were submitted and the knights of Ching and Ch'u3 3 . Wang quotes from the biography (Han-shu, LIV) of the famous Li Ling , where this general describes his soldiers as coming mostly from Ching and Ch'u. were paramount in employment; generals and commanders often were raised to feudal rank and given fiefs; the rapacious4 4 : vul. "go-getters". received handsome rewards. It was the period of the ascendancy of swashbuckling officers, and for a long time afterwards wars continued unceasing, expedition following expedition at short intervals until men-at-arms were completely exhausted and the Government found itself short of funds. j. Now came to the fore ministers specializing in levying taxes and promoting profits, while "angling scholars"5 5 Literally, `scholars of the P'an Brook' . According to tradition T'ai Kung (Lü Shang), future mentor and generalissimo of Wu Wang, was living in retirement in Shen-hsi and fishing in this brook, "waiting for his opportunity"; it was there that Wên Wang, while hunting, met him and brought him to the Chou court. and "bearskin 65 knights"1 1 , commonly translated "bears and grizzly bears", who fought on Huang-ti's side against Ch'i-yu. Thus they are a synonym for brave warriors of antiquity. For the use of the words, also cf. Legge, "The Annals of the Bamboo Books", 143, and Shu-ching, II, i, v, 22, footnote. "Angling scholar" and "bearskin knight", the exemplary scholar and warrior. sank into obscurity. On the Ching, on the Huai,2 2 , the rivers of these names. sluices were now built to facilitate transportation. Tung-kuo Yen3 3 : Yen is here used for , the name as given in the Shih-chi, Han-shu and in chs. IX and XIV of the Yen T'ieh Lun. Cf. p. 2, note 1; p. 35, note 2, supra. and K'ung Chin proposed their plan for the salt and iron monopoly and other sources of profit. The rich were allowed to purchase rank and office, and to escape punishment through the payment of fines. Public expenses continued to grow, while the administrators chased after their own private profit, the people being forced to satisfy both.4 4 : undoubtedly a mistake for and referring to and respectively. The masses being hardly able to bear this, they opposed malpractices and observed the law. Thus ruthless officials were given promotion; there appeared the novel laws of "implicating witnesses" and "lèse majesté".5 5 . Cf. Chavannes, Mém. hist., III, 558. Men like Tu Chou and Chien Hsüan6 6 , persons mentioned in this connection in the Shih-chi (Mém. hist., III, 582). won renown by their harsh interpretations of the law, and others of the type of Wang Wên-shu became prominent through their pitiless, vulture-like, judicial murders. Few were those who, holding fast to the principles of benevolence and justice, wanted to serve their prince; while a multitude conformed themselves, to secure toleration7 7 The acrimony of this discussion developes from the Lord Grand Secretary's charge that the Scholars are incompetent. The Scholars vigorously refute the charge, contending that the officials do not attract Scholars, upon whose services they could safely rely. from above. What could Kung-sun Hung do alone under such conditions?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XI DISCOURSING ON CONFUCIANISTS1 1 See note 9, p. 38, supra, on the term ju , as applicable to the scholars of the Han period; also the discussion of the "Confucian School" of the Han period, in the Introduction. a. The Secretary: You venerate Confucius, oh Literati, as your intellectual progenitor, and intone lauds in praise of his virtue as being unsurpassed from high antiquity down to the present time.2 2 Cf. Mencius, II, i, ii, 23: "Since there were living men until now, there never was another Confucius." Yet in spite of the fact that Confucius cultivated virtue betwixt Lu and Wei3 3 . Chang has Ch'i and Lu. "Lu and Wei" seems to be the correct reading, as it often occurs elsewhere. and spread enlightenment on the banks of the Chu and Ss?,4 4 : rivers of these names. See glossary. his disciples mended not their ways and the world around him turned not to good government, while the dismemberment of the state of Lu went on apace. In Ch'i, King Hsüan5 5 . likewise encouraged the Confucianists and honored the learned. The followers of Mêng K'o6 6 (Mencius). and Shun-yü K'un7 7 . accepted salaries worthy of high lords and discoursed on affairs of state without holding regular appointments. b. It seems that at the gate of Chi of the Ch'i capital there were assembled over a thousand of these doctors.8 8 . Le roi Siuen aimait les hommes instruits qui voyageaient (de pays en pays) pour donner des conseils. Soixante-seize hommes, parmi lesquels Tseou Yen , Choen-yu K'oen, T'ien P'ien (), Tsie Yu (), Chen Tao (), Hoan Yuen () recurent tous de lui des palais particuliers et furent nommés grands officiers de premier rang. Ils ne participaient pas au gouvernement, mais ils discutaient (sur les affaires d'état). Ainsi, dans le pays de Ts'i, les savants au pied de (la porte) Tsi () redevinrent abondants; ils se comptèrent par centaines et furent près de mille. Chavannes, Mém. hist., V, 258—260. While the Yen T'ieh Lun includes the name of Mencius, the text of the Shih-chi does not. Master Kung-sun 67 Hung1 1 . See page 63, note 6, supra. would not have been unique at the time. Yet, when the weak state of Yen attacked Ch'i and in one campaign drove right down to Lin-tsê, King Min fled before the Yen forces to perish miserably at Chiu and none of these gentlemen could save the situation.2 2 The overthrow of King Min at Lin-tsê (284 B. C.) at the hands of Yen , and his subsequent assassination at Chiu , are noted in the Shih-chi, ch. XLVI (cf. Mém. hist., V, 272 seq,). When King Chien was made prisoner by Ch'in,3 3 . Shih-chi, ch. LXVI. Our text has for , "make prisoner". The incident occurred in 221 B. C. (Cf. Chavannes, Mém. hist., V, 279). the learned doctors went into captivity with him, none of them succeeding in preserving the state. If we judge by these examples, it seems that the Confucianist way of bringing peace to a country and honor to its ruler has as yet never proved to be very effective. c. The Literati: Without the help of a whip even Tsao-fu4 4 , the celebrated coachman. would not be able to manage his four-in-hand; without some measure of power5 5 . Chang has for , the two characters being often interchangeable. The Literati employ a legalist argument here. Cf. Duyvendak, Book of Lord Shang, 98. even Shun and Yü would not be able to rule effectively the Myriad People. The phoenix comes not, exclaimed Confucius, the river gives forth no chart—it is all over with me.6 6 The Lun-yü, IX, viii, Soothill's rendering. There are thus situations when even with racing chariots and excellent horses one can not show his speed, and when sagely virtue, benevolence and a sense of duty have no chance to be displayed. d. During the reign of King Hsüan7 7 Chang suggests: "During the reigns of kings Wei (predecessor of Hsüan) and Hsüan . . . .", to accord with the following ". . . through two generations of prosperity". of Ch'i the worthy were manifestly honored8 8 The text has . . . . . . The translation follows Chang's suggestion of inserting before . and scholars promoted indeed; that nation was 68 rich and powerful and its prestige prevailed among the enemy states. Then the majestic vigor accumulated through two generations of prosperity was energetically displayed by King Min. In the south he took Ch'u1 1 . and Huai,2 2 . and in the north annexed the lands of the great state of Sung,3 3 . taking into his fold twelve petty kingdoms; while in the west he drove back the three states of Chin,4 4 . and forced powerful Ch'in5 5 . to retreat. The embassies of the five states6 6 Yen , Ch'in , Ch'u , Chao and Wei , who later, under the leadership of Yen, attacked Ch'i and drove King Min from his capital. paid him homage, and the princes of Tsou and Lu and all feudal lords from the banks of the Ss? river acknowledged themselves his vassals.7 7 . . . . This sentence occurs in the Shih-chi, ch. XLVI, but with for . But he did not cease in displaying boastfully his prowess until his people could bear no more. All the Confucianists8 8 The text reads , but with Duyve?dak ("The Chronology of Hsün-tz?", T'oung Pao, 1928, No. 2, p. 80) I read , despite the fact that the persons named are usually classified as representing various schools. Cf. p. 66, note 8, supra. For a description of the Chi-hsia scholars, see Maspero, La Chine Antique, 516, 553; and Duyvendak, The Book of Lord Shang, 73 seq. in his service, finding their criticism of no avail, scattered abroad; Shen Tao and Chieh Tz? disappeared, T'ien P'ien9 9 Shen Tao, Chieh Tz?, T'ien P'ien. Cf. p. 66, note 8, supra. went to Hsieh,10 10 . and Sun Ch'ing11 11 . proceeded to Ch'u.12 12 . Not a single good minister remained in the country, and the feudal princes now seized their chance to make common cause and fall upon Ch'i. King Chien gave ear to rumors, believed in treacherous intrigue; and following the suggestion of Hou Shêng,13 13 . Cf. Shi-chi, ch. LXVI (Mém. hist., V, 279). At the advice of his counseilor, Hou Shêng, King Chien of Ch'i surrendered to the armies of Ch'in (221 B.C.). he neglected to entertain friendly relations with the feudal princes. It is but natural that with such a policy he should ruin his country and fall prey to Ch'in.14 14 The appearance of the name of Sun Ch'ing , Sun the Minister (al. Hsün K'uang ), in this passage has been noted by a number of scholars in the establishment of the chronology of the philosopher. Our principal modern editor of the Yen T'ieh Lun, Wang Hsien-ch'ien, apparently first called attention to the importance of Huan K'uan's statement in his edition of the Hsün-tz? (1891). See Maspero, op. cit., 564, note 2; and Duyvendak, T'oung Pao, loc. cit., passim. The names and by which the philosopher has been known, are discussed by Maspero, op. cit., 265, note 3; and Duyvendak, op. cit., 75, note 1. Dubs, Hsün-tze, the Moulder of Ancient Confucianism, does not take cognizance of Huan K'uan's references to Sun Ch'ing (cf. Yen T'ieh Lun, ch. XVIII, where the text reads ). 69 e. The Secretary: I Yin1 1 . Cf. Mencius V, i, vii, 1—8, Vindication of I Yin from the charge of introducing himself to the service of T'ang by an unworthy artifice [Legge]. entered the service of T'ang2 2 . through his ability as a cook, and Po-li3 3 . ingratiated himself with Duke Mu4 4 . while feeding cattle. They ingratiated themselves with their princes first, and then only would introduce them to the subject of aspiring to the Protectorate or the Kingship. It is only thus5 5 , omitted in Chang's edition. that they secured for them these positions, when every word of theirs was followed, and every principle enunciated put into practice. Following this method, the Lord of Shang, having found that Duke Hsiao would have none of the "Ways of Kings"6 6 Referring to Shang Yang's initial discourses, before Duke Hsiao, which failed to attract the Duke's attention. See note 1, p. 40, supra. (Duyvendak, Book of Lord Shang, 11). which he had expounded to him, came forward with a plan of building a strong state and was thus able finally to accomplish great things; similarly Tsou Tz?, after having tried in vain to interest contemporary rulers in Confucian lore, finally won renown by his treatises on Mutation, Change, and the Beginning and End.7 7 was the author (according to the Ch'ien-han-shu, ch. XXX) of two works, the Tsou-tz? and the Tsou-tz?-chung-shih , Beginning and End, classed in the school of yin and yang. (Cf. Mém. hist., V, 258, note 8). The So Yin comm. to the Shih-chi (ch. LXXIV), mentions Huan K'uan as sharing with Wang Ch'ung the opinion that Tsou Yen's work, though wild and diffuse, dazzled his feudal patrons. Cf. Lun-héng (Forke's translation), I, 463. Tsou Yen, a voluminous writer, whose works however are lost, occupied an important place in early Chinese thought, particularly in the field of natural philosophy. Cf. Forke, Geschichte der alten chinesischen Philosophie, 503—506. One may say, therefore, that just as a horse is valued for its capacity to run a thousand miles irrespective 70 of the fact that it comes from Hu or Tai,1 1 . so a scholar is honored for his practical ability and not because of his proficiency in letters or dialectics alone. Your Mêng K'o stuck to old practices and was ignorant of worldly affairs, and consequently came to trouble in Liang and Sung;2 2 . Confucius "could square but could not round", and so came to hunger at Li-ch'iu.3 3 . Cf. the Shih-chi, ch. LXXIV, where Ss?-ma Ch'ien discusses the success of Tsou Yen and his kind in comparison with `Confucius starving at Ch'ên and Tsai' , and `Mencius being in straits at Ch'i and Liang' . f. Now, the Confucianists of these latter days, though striving after virtue, find themselves often in dire material circumstances; they speak only to criticize and find therefore no chance to put into effect their ideas. For them, during the long period of over a thousand years since the foundation of the House of Chou, there has been only Wên, Wu, Ch'êng and K'ang,4 4 . to whom they would refer whenever they speak. They take up the unattainable and praise it, just like lame men who can only speak about great distances but cannot walk them. The sages may follow different paths, but have one and the same goal; some advance, some stop, but all have the same aim. g. Though Lord Shang revolutionized laws and changed moral teachings, his object was to strengthen the country and benefit the people; though Tsou Tz? enunciated the doctrine of Mutation and Change, he also concluded with the principle of benevolence and righteousness; Chai Chung5 5 . By being forced to agree under duress to the deposition of the rightful heir of Chêng Hu (duke Chao) and the usurpation of the throne by Li. He was playing for time, cf. Tso-chuan, Duke Huan , XI and XV (Legge, Chi. Classics, vol. V, pt. I, 57, 64), and especially the Kung-yang comm., XI. humiliated himself in order to seize later the opportunity presented by circumstances. One must therefore bend one's self a little in order to stretch one's self in a greater measure: true gentlemen have repeatedly done it. But you, with 71 your one-ideaed obstinacy,1 1 . Lun-yü XIV, XLII, 2; ibid. XIII, XX, 3: "obstinate little men" [Legge]. stick only to one principle after the fashion of Wei Shêng.2 2 . It does not seem worth while for you to mention that Duke Wên of Chin3 3 . deceived the feudal nobles in order to honor the house of Chou, nor to praise Kuan Chung for his courage in facing disgrace in order to survive a debacle. h. The Literati: When I Yin courted the favor of T'ang, he knew him to be a sagely ruler; when Po-li went to Ch'in, he knew the king to be enlightened. In the ability of these two princes they could already recognize future King and Protector: their patents were already written in their lofty countenances. Not blindly nor with their vision obscured did the two worthies decide upon their course of action. If terms be incorrect, said Confucius, then statements do not accord with facts; and when statements and facts do not accord, then business is not properly executed.4 4 Soothill, Analects, XIII, III. . Hu Shih, in The Development of the Logical Method in Ancient China, 23—27, bases the problem of Confucianism, "rectification of names," on this passage: "If names be incorrect, speech will not follow its natural sequence. If speech does not follow its natural sequence, nothing can be established." How could it be said that they ingratiated themselves with purposeful intent in order to accomplish the task of elevating their masters to the positions of Protector and King? A gentleman never acts save by holding fast to virtue and clinging to justice. Therefore, in moments of haste he cleaves to these [principles]; in seasons of peril he cleaves to them.5 5 Soothill, Analects, IV, v. The antecedent of in our text is . Again Mencius said: To stay now at court and yet not to improve its morality—even if I should secure the power of a lord of a thousand chariots, I would not remain for a single day.6 6 The nearest approach to this sentence found in Mencius is VI, ii, IX, 3: "Although a prince, pursuing the path of the present day, and not changing its practices, were to have the empire given to him, he could not retain it for a single morning" [Legge]. He would rather live in poverty and hunger in a mean alley than to change his mode of thought to conform with the ways of the world. 72 i. When Ho-lu1 1 . murdered King Liao,2 2 . Tz? Cha3 3 . left the country and betook himself to Yen-ling4 4 . and never to the end of his days crossed the border of the state of Wu.5 5 This passage occurs in Kung-yang comm., Duke Hsiang , XXIX. The only variation is that the YTL. inserts between and . The murder of King Liao by the usurper Ho-lu (522 B. C.) is recounted in the Shih-chi, XXXI (Mém. hist., V, 20). When the Duke of Lu6 6 Duke Hsüan , cf. glossary. killed Tz?-ch'ih,7 7 . Shu-mien retired8 8 ; for mien read hsi, according to Chang. Cf. glossary under Shu-hsi. and became a hermit refusing to enjoy a salary. To impair one's right conduct to obtain dignities, and to twist one's principles to gain indulgence, are things a gentleman would not do even if his life were at stake. We know of cases when a gentleman would resign office even when righteous doctrines were put into effect; but we have yet to hear of one who bent his principles in order to gain a prince's indulgence. j. The Secretary: According to9 9 The text has immediately followed by the quotation. Chang's edition inserts after Lun Yü. the Lun Yü, With the man who is personally engaged in a wrongful enterprise the true gentleman declines to associate.10 10 Soothill, Analects, XVII, VII, 2. Although Confucius in 3, in loc., admits having made the statement, Huan K'uan is careful not to assign the sentence directly to Confucius. Such is the saying but in practice it is difficult to follow. Thus when the Chi clan,11 11 . lawless and unprincipled, drove their prince from the throne and usurped all power, Jan Ch'iu12 12 . and Chung Yu13 13 . still remained to serve them. The rules of Propriety prescribe, Men and women do not give nor receive ceremonial cups from one another.14 14 Cf. Li-chi, ; Sacred Books, Legge, vol. XXVIII, 298: "According to the rules, male and female do not give the cup to one another, excepting at sacrifice." Chang's edition has inserted after . Yet when Confucius passed through Wei he 73 paid a visit to the mistress of the Duke of Wei1 1 whose name, as given below, was Nan Tz? . prompted by the favorite Mi Tz?-hsia,2 2 . The reference is, of course, to the well-known incident when the Master's call on a notorious woman displeased the disciple Tz?-lu . Lun-yü, VI, xxvi. incurring thus the disapproval of Tz?-lu. Since Tz?-hsia was a court favorite, it was improper for Confucius to get his introduction through him; since men and women are not allowed to mix socially, it was a breach of etiquette for Confucius to visit Nan Tz?. The principles of propriety and right conduct originated with3 3 , add here , according to Lu. Master K'ung himself, yet he personally dealt a blow to the Law while seeking a prince's indulgence. Where, may we ask, is recorded the fact that he retired from office after these events? k. The Literati: The enlightened ruler is concerned when the Empire is not at peace and the states are not at rest; worthies and sages grieve when there is no Emperor above and no margraves below and chaos reigns in the Empire. Thus Yao was concerned over the Deluge, I Yin worried over the people, Kuan Chung went into captivity, and Confucius roamed about the world. They all worried over the people's misfortunes and aspired to set at rest their troubles. Therefore, they toiled either carrying pots and dishes,4 4 I Yin carried his pots and dishes [lit., tripods and stands], blending the five flavors, and became Chief Minister. Cf. Han-shih-wai-chuan . suffering in prisons, or crawling on their bellies, all to bring succor to the people. One must run when pursuing fugitives; one can not avoid a drenching while trying to save a drowning man. Now that the people are trapped in a drain-ditch, we can not but dive to their rescue even at the expense of getting drenched! The Secretary remained silent and did not reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XII FRONTIERS, THE GREAT CONCERN1 1 . Cf. ch. I, paras. d to h. The most detailed study of the age-old conflict of the Chinese with the peoples on the north and west frontiers, designated by Ss?-ma Ch'ien as the Hsiung Nu (Hung-n?) , has been made by de Groot in Die Hunnen der vorchristlichen Zeit. (Chi. Urk. zur Gesch. Asiens, I). The Chinese sources made use of by de Groot for the Han period are especially, Shih-chi CX, (to 97 B. C.), and Ch'ien-han-shu XCIV, (to about 25 A. D.). His posthumously published work, a continuation of studies on the peoples beyond the western frontiers of China, has appeared as a second volume, Chi. Urk. zur Gesch. Asiens, II, Die Westlande Chinas in der vorchristlichen Zeit. The Chinese records of the wars with the Hsiung Nu, the subject matter of the discussion in this chapter of the YTL., appear in chaps. XII and XIII (for the periods 96—85, 85—68, B. C.) of de Groot's first volume. The extraordinary importance in the world's history of the unremitting defence of China's frontier (as advocated by Sang Hung-yang), is summarized by de Groot (op. cit., I, 192): Die Stiftung eines westlichen Hunnenreichs war nun im Werden begriffen; die Abwanderung der Hunnen nach dem weiten Westen und Éuropa, die den Anstoss gab zu der grossen Völkerwanderung, hatte ihren Anfang genommen. a. The Lord Grand Secretary: You say, oh Literati, that the Enlightened Ruler is concerned when the Empire is not at peace and the states are not at rest.2 2 A repetition of the Literati's dictum in para. k, XI. To be sure, the Prince should consider the Empire as if it formed a single household. Even if one man find not his proper position in life, he cannot be happy. Consequently, he is not a Benevolent Prince who lets his people drown in distress3 3 .... Wang omits , as and are interchanged in ancient texts. is held to be a copyist's gloss. without making an attempt to rescue them; and he is not a loyal minister who shows no concern for the misfortunes of his state. To hold fast to his charge in defeat, even unto death, is the duty of a minister; to clothe the cold and feed the hungry is the way of a kindly father. b. At present as our sons and younger brothers, far from home, 75 suffer privations on the borders, the Ruler of Men feels uneasy for them day and night; and all the ministers turn all their energies to the consideration of methods whereby the state revenue might be increased. Thus it came about that the Keeper of the Privy Treasury1 1 . Cf. p. 34, note 4, supra. proposed to establish the liquor excise,2 2 . Cf. p. 2, note 2, supra. in order to provide for the frontier, supply the needs of our fighting men, and bring succor to the people in distress. Out of sheer humanity, could we, their fathers and elder brothers, help but do it? But it has been found insufficient to have thus economized in the interior on prime necessities, in order to relieve the need abroad. If we follow your repeated suggestions to abolish these sources of revenue, and to decrease thereby the provisions for the frontier, we would certainly be acting contrary to the ways of kindly fathers or worthy elder brothers. c. The Literati: In the period of Chou's decline, the Emperor's power grew weak and the feudal lords ruled by force. Consequently, princes sat uneasy on their thrones, and their counsellors rushed restlessly about. Why? Because, threatened by enemy countries on all sides, the Dynasty3 3 The term used here is shê-chi , the spirits, or gods, of the land and grain. In early times each prince, feudal lord, or district, possessed a tutelary god of the soil. The Lord of the Harvest was necessarily associated with the god of the soil. The two terms thus became a synonym for the protecting institution of the ruling family, the "palladium" of the reigning dynasty, as in our text. The origins of the term shê have been exhaustively treated by Chavannes in Le Dieu du Sol dans la Chine antique, and have been recently discussed by Ku Chieh-kang in the autobiographical section of his Ku Shih Pien . Cf. also Maspero, La Chine Antique, 167—175; and Karlgren, "Some Fecundity Symbols in Ancient China," in Bulletin of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities, No. 2, 1930, on the possibility of the original phallic significance of shê. was in constant danger. At present, however, the Nine Provinces4 4 : the Empire. Cf. p. 8, note 5 supra. are enclosed within one boundary and the whole Empire is under one rule. Your Majesty can leisurely promenade through Your lofty halls, while the ministers advance their exhaustive proposals. In unison5 5 , here, is taken as . the hymns and chants sound within Your 76 court, and the jingling bells of Your chariot resound merrily outside.1 1 Li-chi, Ching Chieh [Legge, Sacred Books, Vol. XXVIII, 256]: At his entertainments he listens to the singing of the Odes of the Kingdom and the Odes of the Temple and Altar . . . . When he rides in his chariot, there are the harmonious sounds of the bells attached to his horses. Your pure virtue is as illuminating as that of Yao and Shun; Your illustrious deeds will flow down to posterity. How could the barbarian tribes of the Man or Mai,2 2 . See glossary. and their barren lands, be worth all this trouble and worry that brings us back to the uncertainty of the Warring States3 3 : the several states of China of the Vth to the IIIrd centuries B. C., who struggled incessantly for the hegemony, culminating in the triumph of Ch'in . (Cf. Maspero, La Chine Antique, 392 seq.). The wars of the period form the subject matter of the Chu-shu-chi-nien , the Chan-kuo-ts'ê , and ch. V of the Shih-chi. period. Should Your Majesty be unwilling to abandon them to their fate, You have but to manifest Your virtue4 4 That peoples may be attracted by a manifestation of Kingly virtue is of course a favored tenet of early Chinese literature. The theme of the Odes (Shih-ching, III, i, x, King Wên ), "From the west to the east, From the south to the north, There was not one who thought of refusing submission," has been repeated by Mencius (II, i, iii, 2), and by Hsün-tz? (Bk. XIV [cf. Dubs' translation, p. 166]). towards them and extend Your favors to cover them, and the northern barbarians will undoubtedly come of their own accord to pay You tribute at the Wall. If held to be our "outside subjects",5 5 , found in this passage, are omitted, following Wang's opinion. then the Hsiung Nu will never6 6 "to the end of their days", cf. Lun-yü XIV, x. in all their lives lack the sustenance they need. d. The Lord Grand Secretary: The Sage Ruler gives much thought to the fact that the Middle Kingdom is not yet tranquilized and the northern frontier not yet pacified. So He dispatched the chief criminal judge7 7 "chief criminal judge", an office dating from the Ch'in dynasty and maintained under Han Wu Ti. The text here is evidently corrupt. The t'ing-wei Wang P'ing and others, altogether five officers, were despatched to make such enquiries (cf. the Han-wu-chi , Ch'ien-han-shu, 2nd year of the shih-yüan era). P'ing to inquire about the grievances among the people, to 77 succor the poor and the lowly, and satisfy all the wants of the needy. Envisaging, however, the possibility that in spite of their efforts to make manifest the Imperial virtue and to give peace to the world, the officials1 1 The text has , probably , as an edition, the Hua-pên , cited by Chang, reads. might not obtain complete records, He gave orders that the scholars were to be questioned on these subjects. e. Now, your learned men in their arguments would either try to reach high Heaven or penetrate the Abyss.2 2 Cf. Huai-nan-tz? ch. XIX: Speakers () should stay on the level with the mass () and be in agreement with custom (). Nowadays if they do not discourse on the "Empyrean" (), then they speak of the "Tartarean" () . . . . Then they would attempt, and how ineffectively, to compare the conduct of the affairs of some hamlet or village with the great business of the nation! They come straight from farms or out of their beggars' alleys, unmindful of cold douches of icy waters, as half-awakened drunkards. They have certainly proved unfit to take part in discussions. f. The Literati: If one desired to find the Way to pacify the people and enrich the country, one would find it in a return to the fundamental; for when the fundamental is established, the Way comes of itself.3 3 , from the Lun-yü I, ii: The true philosopher devotes himself to the fundamental, for when that has been established right courses naturally evolve . . . [Soothill]. Follow the principles of Heaven and utilize the wealth of the Earth, and you will accomplish deeds without laborious effort. If you do not improve the fountain-head and busy yourself only with the stream; if you have not the fundamental as the rallying point, although you exhaust your energy and overtax your mind, you will not advantage the administration. In your attempts to settle matters, you only succeed in endangering the situation. And in your efforts to save the situation, you only bring about destruction. The principle of order and disorder depends 78 on whether the fundamental or the non-essential is cultivated. With that understood, you can attain to the Way without exerting your mind. Confucius said: Those who do not understand one's speech are difficult to speak with about administration; men of different ways cannot deliberate with one another.1 1 The first half of this quotation is not found in the Lun-yü; the second is from ch. XV, xxix: Those whose ways are different do not make plans together [Soothill]. The Lun-yü reads for YTL. . Cf. Shih-chi, LXI, where the quotation from the Lun-yü is found followed by , "and so each one follows the bent of his own will." As for you, the Minister, your mind is biased, and therefore you have no use for our words. g. The Lord Grand Secretary: I have heard that a minister should execute his duties with all loyalty, and a son should assume his patrimony with due filial piety. When the ruler commits some error, the minister should cover it. When the father does some wrong, the son should aid and abet.2 2 Cf. Lun-yü XIII, xviii, where Confucius defends this principle: The father conceals the misconduct of the son, and the son conceals the misconduct of the father [Legge]. Here and in the ensuing paragraphs, the statesman employs the Confucian argument, evidently with the direct purpose of attacking his opponents with their own weapons. The clash between the Confucian standards of personal morality, and the emphasis on civic duties maintained by the School of Law, is discussed by Duyvendak, The Book of Lord Shang, 114 seq. Thus, when the ruler dies, the minister does not change his policy. When the father dies, the son does not alter his ways.3 3 Paraphrase of Lun-yü, I, xi: . . . when [a man's] father is dead mark his conduct. If for three years he does not change from his father's ways . . . . [Soothill]. The Spring and Autumn4 4 The story is based on the Kung-yang comm., Wên Kung , XVI. ". . . lady Këang was . . . the mother of W?n. Kungyang says that `the tower of Ts'euen' [] was the name given to that built at Lang by Duke Chwang in his 31st year. The Chuan says: `There came out from the palace of Ts'euen, and entered the capital, serpents, as many as there had been marquises of Loo; and when Këang died on Sin-we in the 8th month, [the duke] caused the tower to be pulled down' " [Legge, Chi. Classics, vol. V, pt. i, 27; cf. also op. cit. 281, note, par. 1]. disapproved of the destruction of the Ch'üan Tower, because the work of the ancestors was destroyed; and this created the impression of a wrong act of old by rulers and fathers. h. Now the salt and iron monopoly and the equable marketing are long standing.5 5 See p. 2, notes 1 and 3, supra, where the date for the establishment of the salt and iron control is stated as 119 B. C., and for the introduction of equable marketing as 115 B. C. To abolish them, would that be possible without 79 destroying the achievement of His late Majesty, and thus aspersing the virtue of the Enlightened Ruler! The officials, therefore, are biased in favor of the ways of loyalty and filial piety.1 1 Here the Lord Grand Secretary cleverly reverses his usual arguments against following the precedents of antiquity; while in the ensuing passage (para. i), the Literati, on the defensive, employ the legalist principle of opportunism, , quoting Confucius to justify it. This is how their ways "differ" from, and why they cannot "deliberate" with, the Literati. i. The Literati: Enlightened persons adapt themselves to the times. The wise devise systems to conform with the needs of their contemporaries. Confucius said: A linen cap is the prescribed form, but nowadays silk is worn. This saves expense and I follow the general usage.2 2 Soothill, Analects, IX, iii. The commentator (Chu Hsi ) is quoted: The prescribed cap was of the very finest linen and of a dark color. Its warp had 2400 strands. Therefore the Sages and the Worthies without departing from antiquity, follow custom but without being partial to what is convenient. Duke Ting of Lu arranged his ancestors' tablets in the order of his remote progenitors and immediate ancestors.3 3 . In the ancestral temple , the four shrines or tablets of the ancestors of a feudal prince were arranged in two rows, north and south of the shrine of the founder of the house . On one side, fronting south, were the of fathers. These were called chao . On the other side, fronting north, were those of sons; these were called mu . Upon the interment of a prince, the tablet of one of the remote ancestors was removed to make room. The ni was the shrine or tablet of the deceased father of the prince. The arrangement of the tablets in the shrines of the ancestral temple was thus specifically prescribed, and any departure therefrom was "unnatural." Duke Ting of Lu (508 B. C. [Legge]) corrected a previous error in the arrangement of the tablets of his ancestors, by restoring them to their proper places. For the arrangement of the ancestral tablets, cf. Couvreur, Li Ki, I, 287, note on , and for , ibid., 415, note. The record of the incident appears in the Ch'un-ch'iu, XI, vii, 15 [Legge, Chi. Classics, vol. V, pt. ii, 768—9, and note]. Duke Chao4 4 . The incident has not been found in the Ch'un-ch'iu, in the chronicle of Duke Chao (Book X). dismissed his ministers and officers to save expense. No one could call this a change in their ancestors' policies or in their father's ways. On the other hand, the Second Emperor wasted money in elaborating 80 the O-pang Palace1 1 , the celebrated edifice constructed by Shih-huang-ti, the "First Emperor" , and described by Ss?-ma Ch'ien (Shih-chi, VI). Any elaboration of the original structure by the Second Emperor , would be an example of extravagance. For the pronunciation and meaning of O-pang, cf. Chavannes, Mém. hist., II, 174, note 5. to promote the prestige of the House, and Chao Kao piled up2 2 is omitted by Chang, but is required to complete the parallelism of the two sentences. the legislation of Ch'in to extend its awesomeness. No one could call them a loyal minister and a filial son.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIII PARKS AND PONDS a. The Lord Grand Secretary: The feudal lord, whose fief can be considered as forming but one household, has his concern limited to his manor. The Emperor, whose domain has as its boundaries the Eight Extremities,1 1 , the eight points of the compass, north, south, east, west, north-east, south-east, north-west and south-west. In this, and the preceding sentence, the terms nei and wai are used again. Cf. p. 40, note 2. has concerns extending far and wide. It is clear that under the small manorial roof the expenses are trifling, in comparison with the great expenditure necessitated by the immense undertaking [of ruling the Empire]. Herein lies the reason for the Government's opening up of parks and ponds, and its concentrating under one hand the mountains and the seas, to secure profits that could be used to supplement tribute and levies. b. We improve canals and sluices, promote various kinds of agriculture, extend farm and pasture lands,2 2 The text has ; the second character should be altered to , which, according to Wang, is the better reading. and develop national reservations.3 3 . The offices of the t'ai-p'u, the shui-hêng, the shao-fu, and the ta-nung,4 4 , are mentioned together in the Shih-chi, XXX, and are explained by Chavannes (Mém. hist., III, 587, note 4) as: "Le choei-heng administrait le parc Chang-lin; le chao-fu, le trésor privé de l'empereur; le ta-nong, les finances publiques; le t'ai-p'ou avait la charge des équipages du palais." For previous mention of the terms shui-hêng, shao-fu and ta-nung, see pp. 2 (note 1), 29 (note 2), and 34 (note 4). compute annually the revenue derived from farm and pasture, and the rentals from farming out pond and weir. Up to the limits of the Empire in the north, supervisors of fields have been appointed;5 5 . and yet with all these efforts to provide for the 82 different items of expenditure, there is still a deficit. Now you desire to abolish all these measures, to stop the fountain of income and the source of revenue, with the result that the people, both high and low, will be in dire need, devoid of means of subsistence. Even though we would like to save effort and cut down expenditure, how can we do it? c. The Literati: The Ancients managed to control land so that it would suffice to nourish the people, and the people would have ample means to satisfy demands from above. In a kingdom of a thousand chariots, or in a district of a hundred li, duke, marquis, count, viscount and baron1 1 , as these titles of feudal China are usually rendered. each filled his want and satisfied his desire; while Ch'in, who consolidated the territory of the Myriad States and possessed himself of the wealth within the Four Seas, remained yet with longings unsatisfied. There was no question here of the trifling expenses under the small manorial roof, but of lust for so many things that the people below could not suffer his exactions. The prince's kitchen stuffed with rotting meat, says the adage, while people hunger in the provinces; the prince's stable full of sleek horses, while starvelings walk the highways.2 2 Cf. Mencius I, i, iv, 4, and III, ii, ix, 9. As now going on, is it not true that raising hound and horse, and rearing reptile and beast, even exceed in expense "the wastage of rotting meat and horses' fodder?" With offices superfluous, activities irrelevant, ever-changing fashions for prodigalities and vagaries, those unwarrantedly feeding and clothing at the expense of the Government are so numerous that it is no wonder we have deficiency above and poverty and distress below! d. Yet the present policy is to strive to make ends meet3 3 . without making an attempt at rigid economy at the source. All kinds of devices are put up to obtain capital:4 4 . farming, and rearing of animals, are taken up; the government competes with the people in fodder production, and with the merchants in the matter of market profits.5 5 The Scholars' criticism is of course not directed against agricultural pursuits generally. It is the intervention of the officials (the Government) and their exploitation of the fields, that they oppose. 83 Such a policy will never help you to make illustrious the Ruler's virtue, or become real gerents of the Commonwealth. Now that men should till and women should weave, this is the "Great Vocation" in the Empire. So the Ancients subdivided the land1 1 Probably the ching-t'ien system of land holding is here in mind, previously advocated by the Literati. Cf. p. 16, text and note 2. to settle the people, and made farming profitable to give them an occupation; as a result, for every occupation there was a plot of land assigned to the individual,2 2 : in (every) occupation there was no unproductive (unoccupied, untenanted) land. and there were no unemployed in the country. e. At present, we see on the other hand the Government opening up national reservations, public fields, ponds, and marshes; but the result is that while the Commonwealth enjoys in name the rentals from the dykes, all the profit derived from them reverts to the plutocrats.3 3 , i.e., "powerful families", who with the suppression of the feudal lords in Han times, and the development of industry and commerce, had become the rich traders. Cf. pp. 11, 17, 25, 31, et al., where the existence of a class of wealthy speculators is referred to. See also Introduction. The Metropolitan District,4 4 , the district in the neighborhood of the capital, Ch'ang-an , in the early Han period. hemmed in by rivers and mountains, is greatly overpopulated. With the people flocking to it from all quarters of the Empire, the supply of grain and fuel falls short; but with the public fields rented out, the mulberries and elms, vegetables and fruits fall in production, and the land is not tilled to full capacity.5 5 . The term was applied to the school of "Intensive Agriculture," ascribed to Li K'uei . Cf. Duyvendak, Book of Lord Shang, 43 and 51. It is our humble opinion that this was not the purpose of the late Emperor6 6 . The "late Emperor", if it be Han Wu Ti, was, however, known not for opening up national reservations, but on the other hand for enclosing them, to gratify his passion for the chase. Tung-fang So (cf. Giles, Biog. Dict, No. 2093) lectured His Majesty on the impropriety of enclosing great tracts of productive land as hunting parks (cf. Wieger, Textes hist., I, 470, ap. Ch'ien-hanshu); while Ss?-ma Hsiang-ju (Giles, ibid., No. 1753) addressed a memorial, celebrated in Chinese prose writings, to the Emperor warning him of the dangers of the hunt (cf. Margouliès' translation in Le Kou-wen Chinois, 74). in opening up parks and 84 reservations, ponds and weirs. They could be turned over to the people in return for certain levies; the Government should get nothing but rents and taxes. Though lease and tax1 1 , i e., the funds obtainable are identical. are different terms, they are identical in substance. With such an arrangement the male population would exert themselves in working in the southern fields,2 2 Cf. p. 13, note 2, supra. while the women would spend all their effort in the production of woven goods. With fields and fallows worked to capacity, and the production of linen going at full speed, both rulers and subjects would have plenty, and what deficiency and distress would there be? Silently the Lord Grand Secretary regarded the Chancellor and his Secretaries.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XIV THE RATIO OF PRODUCTION1 1 , the title of chaps. 80—86 of the Kuan-tz?. For the various renderings of this compound, see note 2, p. 12, supra. I take the meaning here to be "the right balance between production and distribution (consumption)". Cf. also p. 7, note 6. a. Then advanced one of the secretaries who said: Formerly, when T'ai Kung was enfeoffed at Ying Ch'iu,2 2 . he had to clear away the jungle before settling down. The land being poor and the population sparse, he developed the ways and means of benefiting secondary pursuits, and he encouraged to the limit the weaving industry, with such success that the neighboring states began trade with Ch'i; and Ch'i, accumulating capital and increasing the production of goods, became a stronger state with every succeeding generation. When Kuan Chung became Chancellor to Duke Huan, he followed the policy of Ch'i's former ruler, and so manipulated the ratio of production that he forced the submission of mighty Ch'u in the south, and won the protectorate over the feudal lords for his master.3 3 Similar attributions to Kuan Chung by virtue of his employment of ch'ing-chung are made by Ss?-ma Ch'ien in the Shih-chi, XXX and XXXII (cf. Chavannes, Mém. hist. III, 602, and IV, 49). b. His Excellency, the Minister,4 4 .... According to Chang, is superfluous, as it is in a succeeding sentence. In two later passages follows . In each case, Chang construes and as errors for , name, and as representing in the original record of the debate the name of the Minister [Sang] Hung-yang, to whom the remarks of the Secretary and the Literati are directly addressed. has adopted at the present time the policies of T'ai Kung and Kuan Chung. He has put salt and iron under unified control, developed the profits from mountains and seas, so that the production of goods is on the increase. Thus the Government has ample and rich revenues, and people suffer no 86 distress or need. Both the fundamental and the secondary industries are benefited, and all classes are well provided for. All this has been achieved by budgeting and accounting, not by concentrating on the rural occupations, the cultivation of mulberries and grain fields, alone. c. The Literati: the rules of ceremonial and the social duties1 1 . are the foundation of a nation, but the lust for power and profit are the bane of administration. Is a prince able to rule his country with courtesy and deference, — then what difficulty will he have?2 2 Soothill, Analects, IV, xiii. said Confucius. While I Yin and T'ai Kung exalted high their ruler with a territory of but a hundred li, Kuan Chung, enjoying the full confidence3 3 , omitted by Chang. of Duke Huan, could not attain Imperial sway even with power of a thousand chariots, all because he engaged himself in wrongful enterprises. Hence his achievements and fame fell to the ground, and he never succeeded in making his policies prevail. At his time, none of the feudal lords could make use of virtue. They were competing with each other both in public and private matters, and sought thus to undermine one another by power. d. But now that the united Empire forms one big family, why should you wish to make the profits from secondary pursuits prevail, and spread luxury and sophistication? His Excellency, the Lord Grand Secretary,4 4 Cf. note 4, p. 85, supra. having calculated all the state revenue in his head,5 5 . Cf. p. 1, note 3. This unusual faculty for "mental calculations" is mentioned in the Shih-chi, XXX (cf. Chavannes, Mém. hist., III, 568, and note 1). The Literati, perhaps, are ironical here. has already incurred the denunciations of the feudal lords, on account of his liquor excise. Hsien-yang and K'ung Chin have now swelled [the revenues] with their salt and iron monopoly. In company with Chiang Ch'ung and Kêng Ku-chih,6 6 . The latter person is unknown, and Kêng is not used as a surname. Chang suggests reading Yang K'o, a person mentioned in the Yen T'ieh Lun, ch. XXVIII, together with Chiang Ch'ung. always keen and sharp-witted in discussing matters of secondary profits, they 87 have split hairs1 1 , "autumn hairs", a term also used in the Shih-chi (cf. Chavannes, Mém. hist., III, 568, note 2). so thoroughly that, it might be said indeed, they have not left a single outlet. They certainly did not limit themselves to establishing the Nine Bureaux,2 2 , the title of a treatise attributed to Kuan Chung, but now lost. and mustering the profits of mountains and seas, as Kuan Chung did. Yet the nation passes now through a period of depression, and the cities are deserted. There is no other way to educate the people outside of exalting benevolence and social duty; and no other means of enriching the realm apart from applying oneself to the development of agriculture, the fundamental industry. e. The Secretary: The fish in the pond are agitated when otters appear in the water.3 3 Huai-nan-tz?, ch. Ping-lüeh . "He who raises fish in a pond, must be careful to drive away the otters". With powerful recalcitrants among the nation, the common people's livelihood declines. Thus, there cannot be luxuriant herbage beneath a flourishing forest. Nor can grain sprout prettily between great clumps of earth. The principle of governing a country consists in removing the noxious and hoeing out the unruly. Only then will the people enjoy equal treatment, and find satisfaction under their own roofs. Justice Chang4 4 For the title, cf. note 7, p. 76, supra. codified the laws and statutes; published them to give a common standard to the Empire; executed the evil and the crafty, and exterminated those fellows who organized combines. As a consequence, the strong could not take advantage of the weak, and the many could not ill-treat the few. His Excellency5 5 Cf. note 4, p. 85, supra. has busied himself with statistical calculations to increase the state revenue. The resources of salt and iron are monopolized in order to put down the rich traders and big merchants. Offices are offered for sale and criminals may buy themselves off, thus taking from those who have, to aid the needy,6 6 These principles are developed in a celebrated memorial by Ch'ao Ts'o (cf. p. 50, note 1, supra), who advocated substantially the sale of offices as a means of reducing the wealth of the rich (cf. Duyvendak, The Book of Lord Shang, 55, 64—65). Such measures have been previously referred to on p. 65, supra. in the interest 88 of equality among the Black-Haired People. Consequently, in spite of the fact that our armies made expeditions east and west, expenditures were well provided for without increasing the levies and taxes. Arithmetic1 1 , lit., loss and increase, "subtraction and addition", evidently a reference to the special talent of the Secretary's patron, "mental calculations", ironically referred to by the Literati, as above, p. 86. is perceived only by the talented and not understood by the multitude. f. The Literati: Pien Ch'iao2 2 (6th cent. B.C.). His biography appears in the Shih-chi, CV, concluding with the words: "Up to the present [Ss?-ma Ch'ien's time, circ. 100 B.C.] all discussions on the pulse have been based upon Pien Ch'iao" . Cf. Fr. Hübotter, Die chinesische Medizin zu Beginn des XX. Jahr-hunderts und ihr historischer Entwicklungsgang, 12 seq. diagnosed the cause of a disease by merely feeling the pulse of the patient. Where the positive fluid was over-developed, he would lessen it to harmonize with the negative.3 3 Pien Ch'iao appears in the Shih-chi, CV, as discussing the influence of yang (the "positive" principle) and yin (the "negative"). The uses of the "needle" for acupuncture, and the "probing stone" , mentioned at the end of this paragraph, are also set forth by the surgeon in the same passage. When the cold fluid was predominant, he would subdue it to harmonize the positive. Consequently the vital fluid and the pulse were harmonized and balanced, and evil influences were unable to remain. The inferior physician does not know the lines of artery and vein, or the difference between the blood and the vital fluid. He stabs in his needle blindly without any effect on the disease, and only injures the skin and flesh. Now [the Government] desires to subtract from the superabundant to add to the needy. And yet the rich grow richer, and the poor grow poorer. Severe laws and penalties are intended to curb the tyrannical and suppress malefactors. Yet the wicked still persist. Possibly these measures differ from the way Pien Ch'iao used his acupuncture and probing, and hence the multitude have not felt their salutary effect. g. The Secretary: When Chou established the Empire, there were probably a thousand and eight hundred feudal barons. Later on, the strong swallowed the weak, and the large engulfed the small, with the result that there were formed Six States.4 4 Cf. note 1, 43, supra These Six 89 States fought with one another, settling their scores. For several hundreds of years, they fought at home as enemy states, and beyond the frontiers stood off the surrounding barbarians. Thus it is seen that their armies never rested and fighting never diminished. Yet while the troops kept aloft their standards at the front, the storehouses and treasuries in the interior remained full. h. Now, with the resources of the Empire, the wealth within the seas, and the tribute from the hundred commanderies, we possess not merely the food reserves of Ch'i and Ch'u, or the warehouses of Chao and Wei.1 1 . Calculating provisions and estimating income, there should be no needy moment even in times of urgency. Should the whole Ministry of Finance throw themselves body and soul into practicing farming personally in imitation of the illustrious example of Hou Chi,2 2 , traditional patron of agriculture. Cf. note 3, p. 75. the armies sent out in the four directions would still be without [a guarantee of] continuous supplies. This is not because Nature provides us only meager wealth. Nor is it merely a matter of employing "surgical instruments," equalizing surplus and want, or subsidizing the needy. i. But when His Excellency, the Minister, in his capacity of Grain Intendant,3 3 . For , see note 4, p. 85, supra. Chang holds that "with" should read "in his capacity of", which I follow. Chavannes points out that the title did not exist under the early Han and should read (Mém. hist., III, 597, note 1). took over the administration of the Imperial treasurey, with his "needle pricks" and "cauterizing" he stimulated the stagnant flow of wealth, and opened up the pulsing sources of profit along the hundred arteries. As a result all commodities were circulated, and the Government got substantial revenue. At that time, expeditions were sent in four directions against the rebellious and disorderly. The expenses for chariots and armor, and the rewards for conquests and captives, were estimated by billions.4 4 , omitted in Chang's edition. All, however, was supplied 90 by the Treasury. This is certainly an effect like that of Pien Ch'iao and the boon of the salt and iron monopoly. j. The Literati: The people in the frontier districts dwell among mountains and valleys, where yin and yang are not in accord1 1 . For the place of yin and yang in the phenomena of day and night, cf. Maspero, La Chine Antique, 614. and freezing cold cracks the earth. The swirling winds raise storms of acrid dust. Sand and gravel heap up in dunes, and the land in its lay is fit for naught. On the other hand, the Middle Kingdom stands at the center of the Universe2 2 , lit., at the centre of Heaven and Earth. at the merging point of yin and yang. The orbits of sun and moon pass to the south. The mansion of the Dipper and the Pole appear out of the north.3 3 The astronomical observations of the Chinese appear first in the Yao Tien , the opening chapter of the Shu-ching. The earliest notions of the Chinese and the subsequent influence of Iranian and Hindu astronomical systems, have been studied at length by L. de Saussure in the volume, published posthumously and comprising papers appearing over a number of years, Les Origines de l'Astronomie Chinoise (1930). Maspero summarizes Chinese ideas of the solar and lunar cycle in the ante-Han period in the T'oung Pao, No. 4 and 5, 1929, "L'Astronomie chinoise avant les Han"; and a chapter (II) on "L'Astronomie chinoise", is included in La Science orientale avant les by Abel Rey (Livre IV La Science Chinoise [1930]). The land comprises a variety of harmoniously blending climates, and produces all manner of things. To abandon these as we are doing, and seek for conquests beyond the frontier in an attempt to expand more into the sterile land of bitter cold, is like forsaking the fertile valleys of the rivers and banks of the streams, to till on the uplands or in the reedy marshes. k. The stores of the granaries are trundled out, and the riches of the treasuries scattered to the winds, that the needs of the frontinersmen may be met. The Middle Kingdom is in the throes of forced labor and levies,4 4 Chang's edition reads for . while the frontiersmen are beset by garrison duties. While people toil at their cultivation, to obtain grain either by growing or buying is inconvenient. Without the benefit of mulberry trees and hemp growing, they are forced to look to the homeland for their stuffs for clothing. Coats of skins and haircloth are never enough to cover their persons. They cannot discard their 91 doublets in the summer,1 1 . Wang holds that this should be . nor dare they leave their caves in the winter. Fathers and sons, husbands and wives live crowded in one room with mud walls. With both the central and the outlying districts depleted, what effect have your so-called Pien Ch'iao's methods had; from the salt and iron monopoly what boon?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XV UNDEVELOPED WEALTH a. The Secretary: The provinces of the interior, — with a great population, where the water supply is not adjusted to fodder-growing requirements, with climate warm and damp, — are not suited to raising horses and cattre. When farming, people trudge wearily behind the plough; and when walking, they carry their loads on their backs or on poles. They wear out their strength and still obtain little results. Thus the common people have suffered great hardships, insufficiently provided even with clothing and food. Old men and children have been forced to carry burdens and pull carts on the highways, and even ministers and high officials often rode in ox-carts.1 1 The opening paragraphs of the Shih-chi, XXX, employ similar expressions in describing conditions at the beginning of the Han era. (Cf. Chavannes, Mém. hist., III, 539; and Giles, Hist. of Chinese Literature, 103). b. But since His Majesty the Emperor Hsiao-wu2 2 , Han Wu Ti. conquered the Hundred Tribes of the South3 3 . and turned their lands into orchards, drove away the Western and Northern Barbarians,4 4 . and established national reservations, precious novelties and foreign articles fill the Inner Palace,5 5 Cf. ch. II, pp. 14—15, supra. and fleet-footed palfreys and chargers pack the Outer Stables. Every common man can ride a fine mount, and the people feast to satiety upon oranges and pumaloes. This shows what affluence the profit derived from the frontier commandeering has brought. To ask, as you do, what are the blessings that we now enjoy, is to show complete lack of judgment. c. The Literati: When Yü had settled water and land, and laid out the Nine Provinces, every part of the Empire sent in as tribute 93 the produce of its soil1 1 The Shu-ching, II, i, "Tribute of Yü", describes the various products of the Nine Provinces, offered as tribute. in quantities to fill up the palaces and supply the demands of the Ruler of Men. The wealth of the mountains and rivers, and the rich produce of ten thousand li of fertile land, were ample enough to enrich the people, there being no necessity to rely upon the lands of the Barbarian, and the products of distant countries, to provide for all immediate expenditure. d. We have heard that in the not very distant past before the expeditions against the Barbarians of the North and South, labor conscriptions and levies were few, and the people were rich and satisfied. Well fed and warmly clad, they put away the new harvest and subsisted on last year's storage; linens and silks were plentiful, and horses and cattle were gathered in large herds. Farmers employed horses for ploughing or packing, and everyone among the people could ride in saddle or chariot. In fact they considered at the time the advisability of restricting the use of horses to the fields.2 2 . Cf. Tao-tê-ching, ch. XLVI: "When the Tâo prevails in the world, they send back their swift horses to (draw) the dung carts" [Legge, Sacred Books, vol. XXXIX, pt. i, 88]. Cf. also Ilan-fei-tz?, Part VII, ch. xxi, opening paragraph. But later on, because of innumerable military expeditions, there was such lack of battle-horses, that mares and cows were despatched to the front. Colts and calves were now born on battle-fields,3 3 . Cf. Tao-tê-ching, loc. cit., "When the Tâo is disregarded in the world, the war-horses breed in the border lands" [Legge, loc. cit.], as also in Han-fei-tz?, loc. cit. while the six domestic animals were not raised at home; the five cereals were not cultivated on the countryside, and the people had not even enough husks and chaff to go around. How could they feast upon oranges and pumaloes? Following a great war, says the Chuan, recovery is slow to come even after several generations.4 4 The quotation has not been identified. In province and demesne at the present time we often see clearly demarcated but uncultivated fields; in city and burg are houses, but unoccupied. Where is the fat of the land of frontier commanderies of which you speak? 94 e. The Secretary: According to the ancient regulations, one hundred paces of field formed a mou, which the people farmed in accordance with the "well-tithe" system, one share in ten devoted to mutual support,1 1 For "well-tithe" , cf. p. 16, note 2, supra; and for the statements in this passage, cf. Mencius III, i, iii, 6—9, where occur the terms mou , the Chinese "acre" of varying size, and chi , translated by Legge as "mutual dependance". following the principle that the "public interest comes first, private interests second". Such was the fundamental duty of citizen and subject. The late Emperor, taking pity upon the hardships and the sufferings of the multitude and their insufficiency in food and clothing, promulgated new regulations whereby two hundred and forty paces of field constituted an acre, and the tax was levied at the rate of one thirtieth.2 2 The Ch'ien-han-shu (ch. XXIV, Shih-huo-chih ) states that at the beginning of the Han era the tax on land was 1/15, and under Ching-ti (156—141 B.C.), evidently the "late Emperor" of the YTL., was reduced to 1/30. The term used for the land tax is , which has generally been taken as a levy on the produce of the land (in proportion to its annual productivity). Cf. Forke, Das Chinesische Finanz- und Steuerwesen, in Mitteil. des Sem. für Oriental. Sprachen (1900), 168. The YTL. makes clear in the succeeding paragraph, "But now . . . . the rate is based on acreage", that the levy was fixed on acreage, not produce, in the Early Han period. But idle3 3 The text has Chang reads , followed in the translation. subjects refusing to work strenuously on their farms bring hunger and cold upon their own heads by their obstinacy: they want to sow without having ploughed, and to reap without having planted. Why lay the blame for this on the salt and iron monopoly? f. The Literati: The tithe collected for the public benefit consisted only of the people's labor, and the Government shared with the people in the good or bad crops. It would not get more when the people had less, nor would it get less when the people had more. Hence it is said that the tithe was the most proper and just measure for the whole Empire. But now, though the farmers are taxed but one thirtieth, the rate is based upon acreage. Thus in good years when the grain lies about in abundance,4 4 The text reads , while Chang reads , as in Mencius III, i, iii, 7. the actual exaction would be [too] small, while in bad years with famine rampant, the full stipulated amount would be demanded. Add to this the poll tax 95 and corvée duty, and the rate would become actually exactly one half of a man's labor. The farmers are forced not only to yield all of their produce, but are even often obliged to go into debt in order to fulfill the required amount. Thus are the people overtaken with hunger and cold, in spite of their strenuous farming and intense labor. As the wall-builder is first careful to lay a broad foundation before he begins to build to a height, so must the shepherd of the people first stabilize the people's occupation before demanding adequate returns. The Lun Yü says: If the people enjoy plenty, with whom will the Prince share want?1 1 Soothill, Analects, XII, ix. g. The Secretary: In olden days when the feudal lords were struggling for power, and the Warring States came into existence amidst unceasing strife, people were often prevented from working in the fields, yet rendering the tithe did not interfere with their work. But at present by virtue of Your Majesty's sacred powers, there has been no mobilization of troops for a long time. Yet people do not all go to work in the southern fields, and in spite of the subdivision of land in proportion to the population, they still suffer from deficiency. The grain stores are emptied for the relief of the poor and needy more and more every day, idleness being thus increased with more people looking to the government expecting support. It is certainly a matter of exasperation for the Prince, for, while he exerts himself in the service of the people, they still, ungrateful and with no regard to a sense of duty, migrate and flee to distant regions and evade their public duties. The contagion spreads from one to the other; daily the acreage under cultivation decreases; taxes are not paid; attempts are made to resist government agents! Even if the Prince would like to enjoy plenty, with whom is he going to share it? h. The Literati: Frequent transplanting kills a tree; frequent change of habitat weakens animal or reptile. Thus the horses of Tai2 2 , from beyond the northern frontier (cf. p. 70, supra), where the horses used in China are bred. long for the wind of the North, and the flying bird wings its way to its old nest; they all pine for the place of their birth. 96 It is thus plain that the people evade their public duties not because they seek profit; nor can it be said that they find especial delight in migrating. Some time ago, when frequent military expeditions brought about financial distress, constant levies1 1 are taken as "universal mobilization", "conscription", both financial and bodily. were exacted and the burden fell again on the people's farms and homes. These burdens being again increased, they would not go to work in the southern fields. Most of the evasions, however, were committed by the great families, whom the hesitating and pusillanimous officials did not dare to press, and the responsibility was shifted to the common people. The latter unable to bear their extortions, fled or migrated to distant regions. The middle class families were then forced to pay, and the stay-behinds were obliged to fulfill the duties of the lucky fugitives. This is why the people, constantly plundered by the wicked officials, follow one another's example, and in great numbers flee from the places of the hardest pressure to regions where the situation is slightly better. i. The Chuan says: For a liberal administration the people are ready to die; fathers leave sons, and sons fathers, under an oppressive government.2 2 The citation has not been identified. This is the explanation for the daily decrease of the acreage under cultivation, and for the cities becoming gradually deserted. For the principle that a shepherd of the people should follow lies in removing their ills, and leading them to contentment, pacifying them without disturbing them, and employing them without overburdening them. Then the people would diligently apply themselves to their work, and gladly contribute their share of public taxes. Under such conditions, the ruler would need no assistance from the people, and the people would look for no doles from the ruler; rulers and subjects would freely intercommune, and songs of praise would rise. Thus [the Government] would be able to take from the people without provoking their disgust, and enlist their labor without their murmuring. In the poem of the "Spirit Tower,"3 3 Shih-ching III, i, viii; also Mencius I, i, ii, 3. it is shown how the people would address themselves to work without 977 ever being obliged to do so. In such a case, how would the Prince suffer any deficiency? j. The Secretary: In ancient times a lad fifteen years of age entered the higher school, and had to take part in minor corvées; at twenty he received his cap of maturity, and was liable to military service; when he was over fifty, still in his prime and sound in health, he would be called an ai chuang1 1 , lit., "old and sedate". For this passage, cf. the Li-chi, ch. I (Legge, Sacred Books, vol. XXVII, pp. 65—66). . The Book of Poetry says: Fang Shuh is of great age, but full of vigor were his plans.2 2 Shih-ching II, iii, iv, 3 [Legge, Chi. Classics, vol. IV, pt. ii, 287]. Therefore the army of Shang was as numerous as marsh-flowers and that of Chou like crows. Now Your Majesty shows his commiseration for the people by liberal regulations in the matter of corvées. One becomes subject to taxation at the age of twenty-three; at fifty-six one is exempted; the purpose is to aid the elders and to give rest to the aged. Those in their prime are given the chance to cultivate their lands and fields, and the aged to work on their plots and gardens. If they economized their strength and worked according to season, they would have no worry as to hunger and cold. But they do not regulate their families and yet complain against the magistrates. This is indeed absurd. k. The Literati: Those under the age of nineteen should be called shang;3 3 As indicated by the radical, originally meant "untimely death [before 19]"; it then became a synonym for "a youth under 19". Cf. K'ang Hsi Tz?-tien. they are not yet full grown men. They are capped at the age of twenty, marry at thirty and become subject to military service. After fifty, they should be called ai-chuang; they stay at home, leaning on their canes, and they are not subject to corvées; the purpose of these regulations should be to assist the needy and give rest to the advanced in age. At the Village Feast the rule is that the older folk have a separate meal—a special privilege instituted to comfort old men from sixty to ninety years of age, and to indicate clearly how elders should be treated. Thus the elders are not supposed to be satisfied without meat, to be made warm without silk,4 4 Cf. Legge, Sacred Books, [Li-chi], vol. XXVII, p. 241; also Wên Ti's edict in the first year of his reign, Ch'ien-han-shu, ch. IV. or to walk without the support of canes. No such principle 98 of nourishing the elders is in force now when men from fifty to sixty are still made to serve in the transportation service, together with their sons and grandsons, and are equally subject to corvées and labor conscriptions. l. In ancient times, in the event of a major mourning, for a period of three years, [the Prince's call] did not resound at one's door. The idea was to facilitate the execution of the duties of filial piety and leave one free to vent a sorrowing heart. Is not mourning for a parent the unique occasion when a true gentleman wishes to concentrate for the fullest self-expression? But now people are obliged to leave their parents' corpses unattended and to forego the mourning dress to join military service. This is not the proper way of loving the people like children or conforming to their filial and brotherly affections.1 1 The passage "But now people..... brotherly affections", is omitted in the Chang text. When the Duke of Chou held the baby Ch'êng Wang in his arms in attendance on the affairs of the Empire, his favors filled the Four Seas, and his bounties extended to the Four Directions. How much the more should one who reigns in his own right follow this example? All mankind cherished his benevolence and virtue, and everyone was properly occupied. The Book of Poetry says: Night and day he enlarged its foundations by his deep and silent virtue.2 2 The Shih-ching IV, ii, 1, vi [Legge's rendering]. Your Majesty is still youthful in age3 3 Cf. supra, p. 5, note 5; and p. 36, note 9. and is forced to rely upon Your chief subjects and great ministers in carrying out Your administration. It is because of the fact that administration and education are not well balanced, that the common people find it necessary to criticize. The Secretary remained silent, making no reply.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVI TERRITORIAL EXPANSION a. The Lord Grand Secretary: The Prince is all embracing and all sheltering. There is no place for favoritism in his universal love for all; he confers no extraordinary bounties on those near him, nor does he forget to spread broad his favors to those far away. Now we are all equally his subjects, and all are equally his ministers. Yet there is still no equality in security of life, and no even division of labor. Should there then be not any adjustment? You seem to be merely captious, when you only take into account the remote, never thinking of the near. b. The frontier people on the fringes of the Empire, living in a land of bitter cold, ever facing the menace of the powerful barbarians, constantly risk their lives at the first flash of the beacon fires.1 1 . The former, fêng, was a conical brick structure in which to light a beacon fire by night; the latter, sui, a heap of brushwood, the smoke of which was used as a signal by day. Here the two characters are translated as a binomial compound. Therefore, that the Central Domain is able to live in peace, while the frontiersmen are fighting a hundred battles, is all due to the protecting screen of the border commanderies. Says the Odes in criticism of inequality: This is all the sovereign's business, and I alone am made to toil in it.2 2 Not in the present Shih-ching, but from Mencius V, i, iv, 2, where Mencius, analyzing a passage of the Shih, says: "as if the author said: "This is all the sovereign's.....". Therefore the sagacious Emperor in his care of the Four Corners of the earth, alone exerted himself in raising armies to drive back the barbarians, north and south. Enemies were now kept at a distance and calamities were averted. The surplus of the Middle Kingdom, fertile and rich, was distributed to meet the need of the frontier regions. As the frontier regions are strengthened, the Central Domain will enjoy peace. With a 100 peaceful country, there will be no untoward events. What else would you want, and why not keep silent? c. The Literati: In ancient times, the Son of Heaven stood at the center of the world. His domain comprised a perimeter of not more than a thousand li. Territory assigned to the feudal lords did not reach to the non-productive lands.1 1 The feudal system of China of the Chou period has been studied by various Occidental scholars, especially Franke (Zur Beurteilung des chinesischen Lehenswesens, in Sitzungsberichte der Preus. Akademie der Wissenschaften, XXXI, 1927), who holds that "An dem Lehenswesen ist das Reich der Tschou gegangen (p. 376)". Granet includes a chapter (part I, book ii, ch. II) on "La période féodale" in La Civilisation chinoise (1929). The "Tribute of Yü"2 2 , regarded as one of the genuine parts of the Shu-ching (Hsia Shu, I), dating from the period between the ninth and fourth centuries B.C. It contains a somewhat idealized description of ancient China, with the determination of the tributes payable by the several regions, intermixed with the legend of Yü's labors in curbing the floodwaters. It is partly in prose and partly in verse. Cf. Legge, Chi. Classics, vol. III, pt. i, 93, notes. Chavannes has made an analysis of the Shu-ching (Mém. hist., I, cxiii—cxli), and of the Yü Kung (ibid., note from 102). Cf. also Pelliot, Le Chou King en caractères anciens et le Chang Chou Che Wen, in Mém. concernant l'Asie orientale, vol. II (1916). See p. 8, note 5, supra. extended to five thousand li. People supported their respective rulers, and the feudal princes protected their respective territories. Hence the people enjoyed equality and harmony, and the duties involved in forced labor were not strenuous. Now we have pushed back the Hu and the Yüeh several thousand li. The routes have been circuitous and lengthy.3 3 in Chang's edition, which I follow. The troops are worn out. Hence the people of the frontier are brought face to face with suicide, and China suffers from death and ruin. This is why the people clamor and will not be silent. d. The principle of administration lies in proceeding from the center to the periphery, beginning from the near. Only after those near at hand have attached themselves submissively to the government, steps may then be taken to rally the distant. After the people within are contented, then care will be taken of those afar. Hence when the ministers proposed to colonize Lun T'ai,4 4 . the Enlightened Monarch did not give his assent, thinking that his proper calling 101 was to remedy the immediate problems of the moment. Thus he issued an edict to the effect that the problem of the present was to interdict harsh and cruel treatment of the people, to put a stop to arbitrary levies, and to concentrate upon the fundamental industry of agriculture. The ministers ought, therefore, to follow the wish of the Emperor by reducing and removing the incompetent to help the people in their extremity. Now that the Empire within is in decline, yet they show no anxiety, but busily engage themselves rather in the frontier questions. Is it not probably true that there are vast areas lying uncultivated, much sowing without harrowing, and much labor without fruit? Well may the Odes say: Do not try to cultivate fields too large; — the weeds will only grow luxuriantly.1 1 Shih-ching I, viii, vii, 1 [Legge's rendering, Chi. Classics, vol. IV, pt. i, 157]. e. The Lord Grand Secretary: It was not out of sheer delight in war that T'ang and Wu2 2 , again the traditional founders of the Shang and Chou dynasties. resorted to arms. Nor was it due to lust of conquest that King Hsüan of Chou3 3 , who began his reign 828 B.C. extended his territory a thousand li. Their purpose was to uproot foreign foes and internal rebels and thus to tranquilize the people. For a wise man will not undertake a purposeless expedition and a sage King will not covet a useless land. The late Emperor raised armies in the spirit of T'ang and Wu and settled the distress of the Three Frontiers.4 4 . Then he turned in one direction to subdue the enemy. As the Hsiung Nu fled, he constructed defenses along the rivers and the mountains. Hence he turned away from the barren wastes of sand, rock and alkali, ceded the district of Shih-pi,5 5 . and the territory of Tsao-yang6 6 . to the Hu tribes. He dispensed with the garrison at the bend of the Great Wall, occupied the strategic positions on the Yellow River, and limited himself to guarding the important points in order to lighten garrison duty and yet render adequate protection to the people. From this it can be seen that the Sage Ruler's aim is not to aggrandize the Empire through burdening the people. 102 f. The Literati: The Ch'in dynasty assuredly went to extremes in waging wars. Mêng T'ien1 1 . certainly extended the boundary to a great distance. Now, we have far overreached the barrier set up by Mêng T'ien, and have established administrative areas in the land of the raiding nomads. As the land extends to greater distance, people suffer from a greater burden. To the west of the Shuo-fang,2 2 . and to the north of Ch'ang-an,3 3 . the outlay for the organization of new commanderies, and the expenses of the outposts are beyond calculation. It is not only this. When Ss?-ma [Hsiang-ju] and T'ang Mêng4 4 , two of Wu Ti's generals, who accomplished the conquest of west and south-west China. bored through a road to the south-western tribes,5 5 , aboriginal tribes of Ss?-ch'uan. Cf. Shih-chi, CXVI. Pa and Shu6 6 , the region of modern Ss?-ch'uan. began to be oppressed by the Chiung and the Tso.7 7 , the mountain passes from the east into Ss?-ch'uan. For the latter the Shih-chi reads P'o , a tribe of aborigines in Kuei-chou. For both names, cf. Chavannes, op. cit., III, 551, note 2. "Across the seas"8 8 Cf. glossary sub Hêng-hai chiang-chün. despatched expeditions against the southern barbarians;9 9 , tribes of Yünnan.

Cf. Grousset, Hist. de l'Extrême-Orient, II, 600. After the "General of the left wing"14 14 Cf. glossary sub Tso chiang-chün. attacked Korea15 15 . The conquest of Korea and its division into four prefectures, was also effected under Han Wu Ti (109 B.C.). Cf. Wieger, Textes hist., I, 512—515, ap. Shih-chi CXV, and Ch'ien-han-shu. The Shih-chi devotes chaps. CXIII—CXVI, to a recital of the Chinese conquests of various tribes herein mentioned. For the Ch'ien-han-shu's record of these campaigns, cf. Krause, Fluss- und Seegefechte nach chinesischen Quellen, in Mitteil. des Sem. für Orient. Sprachen, XVIII, 1915, pp. 65—74. and opened up the land of Lin T'ao,16 16 .

Chang Ch'ien2 2 , the famous general of Han Wu Ti who made two expeditions into central Asia, one in 138, and again in 115, B.C. A short biographical note occurs in ch. CXI of the Shih-chi, and his second expedition is mentioned in the same work, ch. CXXIII. Cf. also Chavannes, Mém. hist., I, lxxii seq. De Groot, in Die Westlande Chinas in der vorchristlichen Zeit, chaps. II—III, assembles the notices of Chang Ch'ien's exploits as general, envoy, and explorer, as found in the Shih-chi, loc. cit., and ch. XCVI of the Ch'ien-han-shu. See also Wieger, Textes hist., I, 494—499. penetrated to strange and distant lands, but brought in only useless exotics. Thus the reserves of the treasuries flow to foreign countries,3 3 Cf. ch. II, para. c, supra. and the vast outflow is incomparable with [the economies effected on] the cost of Shih-pi, and the labor for Tsao-yang [which had been saved].4 4 The conquests of Han Wu Ti, referred to in paras. e and f, are narrated at length by Ss?-ma Ch'ien in his famous chapter XXX, translated by Chavannes, with extensive notes on the geographical regions involved, in Mêm. hist., III, 548—553. See glossary for the numerous names employed. From this it is seen that the whole affair is not due to the solicitude of the Emperor, but the mistaken calculations for the government of busy-body officials. g. The Lord Grand Secretary: He who possesses the wisdom of Kuan Chung5 5 "The wisdom of Kuan Chung": "of Kuan and Yen " (Lu). "Chung" seems to be the accepted reading. would not take up the offices of an underling. He who possesses the acumen of T'ao Chu,6 6 . The biography of this Croesus of ancient China is given in the Shih-chi ch. CXXIX, under his original name of Fan Li . would not remain in poverty. The Literati are capable of speech, but incapable in action. They occupy a low position, and yet blame their superiors. They remain poor, while criticizing the rich. They make extravagant speeches, without following them up. They are high sounding, but their conduct is low. They criticize, praise, and discuss, in order to gain a name and the favor of the time. Those who earn salaries of not more than a handful, are not qualified to talk about government. Those who at home possess less than a load or shih [of grain] are not qualified to plan things. All the scholars are poor and weak, unequipped with necessary clothes and hats.7 7 A telling thrust for those scholars who talk about ceremoniousness and yet do not possess the prescribed cap and dress, indispensable to the "true gentleman" . What do 104 they know about the affairs of the state or business of the officials? What [do they know about] Shih-pi and Tsao-yang? h. The Literati: A humble station does not circumscribe wisdom. Poverty does not impair one's conduct. Yen Yüan1 1 , the favorite disciple of Confucius. was frequently down to a bare cupboard, but he cannot be said to have been unworthy. Confucius, though not looking the part,2 2 , "The physiognomy of Confucius was such that his face was like a rumpled square" [Dubs' translation, 69], said Hsün-tz? in his attack upon the ancient Chinese belief in "physiognomy", which professed to read the character of a person by his appearance (Hsün-tz?, Bk. V, ) cannot be denied as a sage. If 'one must recommend a man according to his appearance and promote a student according to his métier, then T'ai Kung would have wielded his butcher's knife throughout his life3 3 is explained as the knife used in slaughtering the sacrificial ox. Cf. Tz'?-yüan sub . and Ning Ch'i4 4 , a carter who rose to be a Privy Councillor of Ch'i. Cf. Giles, Biog. Dict. No. 1568. would never have ceased to tend his cattle. The ancient gentleman maintained his principles in establishing a name, and cultivated his personality while waiting his opportunity. Even poverty would not make him change his principles, nor would he alter his objective because of low position.5 5 This, and the succeeding sentences, represent Confucianist and Mencian aphorisms. He would abide in benevolence and act according to duty. He was even fastidious in the presence of money. Discerning profit he turned his regard to duty. To acquire riches in an improper way and high position without justification—this the benevolent would not do. Hence Tsêng Shên and Min Tz?6 6 , disciples of Confucius. would not exchange their benevolence for the wealth of Chin and Ch'u,7 7 . and Po I8 8 . would not sell his character for the rank of a prince. With such as they, Duke Ching of Ch'i9 9 . with all his thousand four-in-hands could not compete in fame. 105 i. Confucius said: What a man of worth was Hui! A single bamboo bowl of millet; a single ladle of cabbage soup; living in a mean alley! Others could not have borne his distress, but Hui never abated his cheerfulness.1 1 Soothill, Analects VI, ix. Therefore only the benevolent knows how to live in straits, enjoying his poverty;2 2 Paraphrasing the Lun-yü, IV, ii. while the mean man becomes oppressive when rich, and shifty when poor. Yang Tz? said: He who seeks to be rich will not be benevolent. He who wishes to be benevolent will not be rich.3 3 Legge's translation. Mencius III, i, iii, 5. Mencius has . If gain is preferred to honor, and all try to acquire and to rob with an insatiable appetite, then the ministers will accumulate millions of wealth, the high officials gold in thousands of pieces, and the smaller officers their hundreds. With this self-enrichment and the accumulation of concentrated wealth, the common people will be left in cold and misery, wandering along the roads. How could the Scholars alone keep up a complete outfit of caps and clothing?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVII THE POOR AND THE RICH a. The Lord Grand Secretary: For more than sixty years have I1 1 The biography of the noted statesman and fiscal expert, the Lord Grand Secretary Sang Hung-yang , appears in the Ch'ien-han-shu, ch. XXIV, 2nd part. His important rôle in the institution of the state monopoli?s is described in the Shih-chi, ch. XXX. (Cf. p. 1, note 3, supra). In 87 B.C., six years before the present debate, the Emperor Wu had promoted him to the high post of Yü-shih ta-fu , which I translate as "Lord Grand Secretary". He occupied the post seven years, then was executed by order of the Emperor Chao, on the charge of plotting a rebellion. The term Yü-shih is found in the Chou-li , and in the extant Shang-chün-shu, para. 26, and up to the later Han period involved secretarial duties (cf. Franke, Der Ursprung der chinesischen Geschichtschreibung, Sitzungsberichte der Preus. Akad. der Wissenschaften, XXIII, 1925, p. 283). From the later Han period the office took on the functions of a "censorate", perhaps acquiring some of its features as such, from the ideas of the School of Law, as suggested by Duyvendak, Book of Lord Shang, 124. been the recipient of Imperial emolument and favor since the time when, at the age of thirteen, I first tied my hair and girded myself with the sash,2 2 . Cf. Li-chi, XI, iii, 10 (Couvreur, Li Ki, I, 710). and had the fortune of becoming an Imperial chamber page,3 3 . serving in the Emperor's retinue4 4 . until I rose to the rank of minister. In regulating the expenses for cars, horses, and robes and the expenditure of my family, servants and clients, I balance the debit and credit side of my budget and live a life of strict economy. I keep account of each and everyone of my salaries, appointments, and gifts. My wealth has accrued gradually until I have become rich and acquired an estate. Thus do the worthy maintain their holdings through a uniform system of subdivision, and the wise keep an account of their wealth by systematic distribution. 107 Now, when Po Kuei1 1 Chang's edition has Tz? Kung first (instead of Po Kuei ), and T'ao Chu-kung for Tz? Kung. The Shih-chi, ch. LXVII, contains the passage that Tz? Kung's house "piled up a thousand pieces of gold" ; while in ch. CXXIX, the same faculty is ascribed to Fan Li (al. T'ao Chu[-kung]), in the space of nineteen years, a phrase which has become proverbial. made use of goods neglected by others and Tz? Kung three times acquired a capital of a thousand gold pieces, were they necessarily forced to draw upon the resources of others? No, they simply manipulated it with the squared inch, manoeuvred it with surplus and deficit, and gathered it in between high and low prices. b. The Literati: In ancient times, no man pursued two occupations at the same time, and trading profits and official salary could not be combined. For only then would there be no disparity between occupations, and no tipping of the balance of wealth. Had you borne your high rank and appointments with humility and courtesy, you would have all the fame you could desire; but as you seek profit by taking advantage of your power and station,2 2 , the legalist terms, reprobated by the scholars, though sometimes used by them for argument's sake, as in para. d, below. Cf. note 1, p. 47, supra. your income reaches levels incomputable. Indeed with him who feeds on the Nation's lakes and pools and controls the mountains and seas, shepherds and woodcutters are unable to compete for benefit, and merchants and peddlers, for gain. Tz? Kung secured wealth in the capacity of a common citizen; yet Confucius disapproved of him. How much more would he frown on him who does it through his position and rank! In fact, in ancient times ministers were thoughtful of benevolence and duty in fulfilling their office, and never considered using the advantages of their power to satisfy their private interests. c. The Lord Grand Secretary: It is only when mountain and hillside have abundance that the people can enjoy plenty, and only when the seas and rivers have their riches that the masses can satisfy their wants. An ordinary scoop can not irrigate terraced fields, nor can timber from hillocks and downs be used for the construction of palace halls, for the small can not encompass the big nor can it be of assistance to the plentiful. We know of no case when one unable to provide for himself was yet able to provide 108 for others; when one unable to regulate himself was yet able to regulate others. Thus he can do most for others who has proved his ability in working for himself; and he can best regulate others who has proved his worth in regulating himself. But you Scholars who have never been able to regulate your own homes, how can you hope to be able to regulate affairs beyond your ken?1 1 and , here, are thus construed. d. The Literati: One has to make use of carts in travelling over great distances,2 2 The Chün-shu-chih-yao inserts after , as an extra character to balance the following . and to depend on ships in crossing rivers or seas. A worthy scholar has also to rely on capital and avail himself of materials in order to reach achievement and make a name for himself.3 3 Chang's edition omits this sentence altogether (15 characters). Kung-shu Tz?4 4 , the carpenter. was able to construct great palaces and towers with the timber supplied by his royal patron, but unable to build for himself even a small house or a tiny hut, his own timber being insufficient. Ou Yeh5 5 , the founder. could cast whole6 6 Chang reads (for of our text), which I follow, to balance the succeeding . cauldrons and huge bells out of the copper and iron supplied by his prince, yet could never make for himself even a single tripod-kettle or a wash-basin,7 7 The text here, , is quite corrupt, and discloses an interesting confusion of characters. , originally in its equivalent form , should be , "kettle", while should be , a "wash-basin", in the opinion of the commentators. as he possessed not the necessary material. A true gentleman may base himself on the legitimate sovereign8 8 Wang notes that is equivalent to , and inserts after , to balance the same character in the preceding sentences. authority of the Ruler of Men, in order to harmonize the interests of the people and bring prosperity to the masses, but can not enrich his own family, for his position is not conducive to such an end. Thus when Shun was farming at Li Shan,9 9 , the mountain mentioned on p. 12 supra. his bounties did not extend 109 to cover all the villages of the province; when T'ai Kung was a butcher at Ch'ao Ko,1 1 . his profits did not benefit his wife and children. But when they finally found official employment, their munificence flowed to the uttermost limits of space, and their virtue filled to the brim the Four eas. Shun, therefore, was obliged to rely on Yao, and T'ai Kung depended upon Chou. A true gentleman can only cultivate his person2 2 , cf. Lun-yü XIV, xxv and xlv. The Literati here touch upon the basic Confucian principle that virtuous conduct is for the benefit of all. For a discussion of the principle of "self cultivation", cf. Maspero, La Chine Antique, 464 seq. The following use of "right conduct", in the ethical Confucian sense, inspires the Lord Grand Secretary to repeat the same term, but in the meaning employed by the Taoist school. See succeeding note. so that, relying on right conduct, he will be able to benefit others; but he can not twist his principles in order to increase his own capital. e. The Lord Grand Secretary: Tao3 3 , the term of the Taoist school, representing the ultimate principle of all being: "There was something undefined and complete, coming into existence before Heaven and Earth. How still it was and formless, standing alone, and undergoing no change, reaching everywhere and in no danger (of being exhausted)! It may be regarded as the mother of all things . . . . I do not know its name, and I give it the designation of the Tao (the Way or Course) . . . ." Tao-tê-ching, para. 25 [Legge's translation, Sacred Books, XXXIX, 67]. A recent discussion of the Taoist school is found in M?spero, La Chine Antique, Bk. V, ch. iii, L'École Taoïste. hung its laws in the heavens and spread its products on the face of the earth for the wise to increase their substance therewith, while the stupid remain in distress. It was thus that Tz? Kung became famous among the feudal nobles for his display of accumulated wealth, and T'ao Chu-kung was esteemed by his contemporaries for his abounding riches. The rich sought their friendship; the poor looked to them for support. Thus all, from the ruler above to the simple-dressed commoner below, venerated them for their virtue and praised them for their altruism. At the same time, Yüan Hsien4 4 , a disciple mentioned in the Lun-yü VI, iii, XIV, i, who retained his good nature despite poverty. and K'ung Chi5 5 , known as Tz? Ss? , a disciple of Tsêng Tz? , whose name has been associated with the composition of the Ta Hsüeh and the Chung Yung . Cf. Fêng Yu-lan , History of Chinese Philosophy, vol. I, , 1931. suffered all their 110 from hunger and cold, and Yen Hui1 1 , favorite disciple of Confucius. Cf. Soothill, Analects, Introduction, 86. lived in chronic want in a beggars' alley. In those moments when pursued by poverty, they found shelter in caves and caverns and covered their bodies with ragged hemp-wadded clothes, even if they wished to place their reliance on wealth, resorting to crime and deceit, they would not be equal to it. f. The Literati: If wealth were a thing one could (count on) finding, said Confucius, even though it meant my becoming a whip-holding groom, I would do it. As one can not (count on) finding it, I will follow the quests that I love better.2 2 Soothill, Analects, VII, xi. The YTL. reads for of the original. The true gentleman seeks duty, not wealth at any price. Hence the criticism pronounced on Tz? Kung for not being content with his lot and increasing his goods. A true gentleman would attain wealth and rank when the times favor him; otherwise he would retire, and enjoy the way of virtue,3 3 , used here in the Confucian sense, i.e., in its moral application, — the courses or ways that are right and proper. The passage is suggestive of the Lun-yü, IV, v, 1: "wealth and rank are what men desire, but unless they can be obtained in the right way", etc. . . . . [Soothill's translation]. and never seek to burden himself with questions of profit. Thus he never turns his back on duty or is recklessly grasping; he would rather live an inconspicuous life and cultivate his principles lest he injure his conduct. He therefore never ruins his reputation in pursuit of position. Though to him be added the families of Han and Wei,4 4 Cf. Mencius VII, i, xi: "add to a man the families of Han and Wei. If he then look upon himself without being elated, he is far beyond the mass of men" [Legge's translation]. he would not remain with them should it be contrary to his objective. Wealth and rank add not to his honor, slander and defamation do him no harm. g. Therefore the shabby hemp-quilted robe of Yüan Hsien was more illustrious than all the fox and raccoon furs of Chi-sun;5 5 . "The head of the Chi family was richer than the Duke of Chow had been . . . .", Lun-yü, XI, xvi, [Legge's translation]. the 111 meager fish fare of Chao Hsüan-mêng1 1 . far more delicious than all the viands of Chih Po;2 2 . and Tz?

They did so because the two scholars' were rich in benevolence and complete in their virtue. Therefore, why must honors be given to wealth, when they are really due to benevolence and righteousness?</field>
      <field name="fulltext">CHAPTER XVIII VILIFYING THE LEARNED a. The Lord Grand Secretary: It is not the nature of a scholar to nurse crookedness while speaking straight and true, to rely upon himself as if desiring nothing while actually not following in conduct.1 1 The Shih-chi, ch. LXXXVII (Biography of Li Ss?) has the phrase "relying on one's self in a condition of non-activity, that is not the nature of a scholar", [Duyvendak's translation, T'oung Pao, XXVI (1928), The Chronology of Hsün-tz?, p. 92], while the YTL. reads . Li Ss?2 2 , perhaps the most execrated person of all time in the minds of Chinese scholars, for his instigation of the first "bibliothecal holocaust", the destruction of all existing literature, save works on agriculture, medicine and divination (213 B.C.). Ss?-ma Ch'ien devotes his LXXXVIIth chapter to a lengthy biography of the First Ch'in Emperor's Prime Minister; while in the VIth chapter appears the account of the famous debate before the throne, when the decision against the scholars was taken. The Shih-chi's biography (translated in part by Duyvendak, loc. cit.) confirms the statements regarding Li Ss? as a pupil of Hsün Ch'ing and his subsequent career and Pao Ch'iu Tz?,3 3 . Cf. glossary. according to tradition, both sat at the feet of Hsün Ch'ing.4 4 , the philosopher Hsün-tz? or Sun-tz?, cf. p. 68, note 14. Their training completed, Li Ss? entered the service of Ch'in where he subsequently rose to the rank of one of the Three Highest Ministers,5 5 Cf. p. 62, note 4, supra. and possessed of the power6 6 , omitted in Chang's edition. of a lord of ten thousand chariots he held sway over the realm within the Seas, in achievement equal to I Yin and Lü Wang,7 7 [ or ]. See glossary. in fame loftier than Mount T'ai.8 8 (otherwise ), in Shantung, the chief of the Five Sacred Mountains of China. For its place Chinese religion, cf. Chavannes Le T'ai Chan. But Pao Ch'iu never got beyond the 113 oeil-de-boeuf1 1 an expression meaning either a broken jar used for a window, or a small window, round as the mouth of a jar, often in houses of the poor. Cf. the Tz'? yüan. of a thatched hovel, his fate comparable to that of frogs which, though multisonous indeed during a flood year, are but destined to perish sooner or later in some drain or ditch. Now, lovers of disputation,2 2 The text has ; the last character, according to Chang, should be . without proper means to support yourselves at home and with no great reputation abroad, poor and inconspicuous that you are, even though you can talk on proper conduct, neither is your weight very great. b. The Literati: When Li Ss? became Chancellor of Ch'in, Shih-huang appointed him to an office which was higher than that of any other person or minister. Yet Hsün Ch'ing did not take office under him, prescient that he would fall into unfathomable disasters.3 3 Cf. Duyvendak, T'oung Pao, loc. cit., where this passage from the YTL. is quoted in connection with the establishment of the dates of the philosopher, the conclusion being that Hsün-tz? never took office under his pupil, during the many years of Li Ss?'s service with Ch'in. Pao Ch'iu Tz?, who lived on wild kraut growing among the hemp, and cultivated the Way of virtue beneath a plain whitewashed roof, was happy in his aspirations, more contented than were he living in a spacious mansion with meat as his fare. Though never enjoying resplendent station, he was yet free from all petty anxiety. c. Now Duke Hsien of Ch'in's4 4 See next page note 2. Ch'ui Chi gem5 5 , referred to on p. 111, supra. was beautiful beyond dispute; but Kung Chih-ch'i,6 6 . Cf. Giles, Biog. Dict., No. 1021. seeing it, groaned, knowing well that it was part of Hsün Hsi's7 7 . Cf. Giles, op. cit., No. 805. plot against his country. Chih Po8 8 . possessing all the wealth of the Three Chin States9 9 . was certainly at the height of his power; yet hardly did he suspect that Hsiang Tz?10 10 . planned to entrap him. The fox and raccoon furs of Chi Sun11 11 . were undoubtedly magnificent; yet never did he suspect 114 that the prince of Lu1 1 . considered him as a menace to his state. Thus did Hsien of Chin2 2 []. hook Yü and Kuo3 3 . For these and the preceding names, see glossary. by means of the precious horses, and through the city did Hsiang Tz? enveigle Chih Po with the result that the latter fell into the hands of Chao, and Yü and Kuo were both annexed by Chin. Thinking only of what they were about to obtain, regardless of consequence, Chih Po and the two states only coveted territory or valued prized mounts. As Confucius said: Who heeds not the future will find sorrow at hand.4 4 Soothill, Analects, XV, xi. d. But our present-day authorities see only gain, never providing against possible loss; and only covet prizes, never considering possible disgrace, always willing to exchange their lives for profit and to die for money. They enjoy the privileges of wealth and rank without ever possessing the virtues of altruism and right conduct; indeed they are as one who steps upon a trap ready to be sprung, or one who is dining under a portcullis! Thus it was that Li Ss? suffered the five penalties:5 5 , as related in the Shih-chi, LXXXVII. This was the extremity of the law, and represented branding on the forehead , cutting off the nose , maiming (cutting off the ear, the hands, or the feet) , castration , and death . These "five punishments" prevailed under the Chou and Han dynasties. There was a bird in a southern clime called Wan-chu. He would eat nothing but the bamboo core, drink nothing but the water of the clearest spring. As he flew over Mount T'ai, the Kite of T'ai Shan, who was just picking up a decayed rat, looked up and saw Wan-chu. "Shoo!" cried the Kite.6 6 This allegory is found substantially in the Chuang-tz? , in which Chuang-tz? ridicules the sophist Hui-tz? , who at the time was minister of the state of Liang . (Cf. , [Legge, Sacred Books, vol. XXXIX, pt. i, p. 391, and Wilhelm, Dschuang Dsi, p. 134]). The Literati turn this tale against Sang Hung-yang, eliciting from the Minister a lecture on the propriety of refined manners. Now, with all your wealth and rank, Lord High Minister, it pleases you to scoff at us Confucian scholars, as you do so frequently. Is not your 115 conduct similar to that of the Kite of T'ai Shan "shooing" at the Wan-chu! e. The Lord Grand Secretary: 'Tis Learning's part to curb crude speech, and Courtesy's function to veneer rustic manners. Thus Learning should prop Virtue, Courtesy should civilize Crudeness. Our minds should weigh words before speaking; action after thought gives pleasure. Lips should not open to let forth bad language, and one should keep away from evil doings. In every move and action one should comply with good manners, endeavoring to walk with dignity along the path of decorum. Behave therefore in accordance with propriety, and let your utterance be in accordance with the rules of courtesy. It is only thus that you may speak all day without being malapert, and act all your days without setting a bad example.1 1 . Lu reads for , "without incurring malevolence". Now, the Ruler of Men, in order to govern the people, has provided offices and established courts, and has distributed ranks and assigned salaries to honor the worthies — and you speak here of portcullis and decayed rats! Fie! To be so coarse in speech and so pervert to schooling! f. The Literati: The Sage Ruler provides offices for carrying out necessary functions; it is for the able to occupy them. He distributes salaries for the sustenance of worthies; it is for the capable to receive them. For the just and honorable, no honor should be too high and no emolument too great. Thus Shun received the Empire from Yao, and T'ai Kung could not but occupy the post of one of the Three Highest Ministers with the Chou. If one be unfit for any position, even the giving of but a basket of rice and a plate of soup,2 2 The passage expresses the sentiment found in Mencius, VI, i, x, 6, "Here are a small basket of rice and a platter of soup, and the case is one in which the getting them will preserve life, and the want of them will be death; — if they are offered with an insulting voice, even a tramper will not receive them . . . . even a beggar will not stoop to take them" [Legge's translation]. The same figure, "the matter of a dish of rice or a platter of soup", in a similar association, appears in Mencius, VII, ii, xi. would be like giving alms. Therefore, those whose station was high and yet their virtue thin, whose responsibility was heavy but strength small, were few, for they were not equal to it.3 3 . I place the comma after . The Kite of T'ai 116 Shan picked up but a decayed rat in some remote marsh or obscure valley; he never intended to do harm to anyone. But you, our present officiators, you rob the Ruler's treasury and feed upon it in the very face of the punitive laws, unaware that their mechanism may be set into motion! And with all that, you "shoo" at people! In villainy indeed you can hardly be compared to the Kite of T'ai Shan! g. The Lord Grand Secretary: Said Magister Ss?-ma:1 1 . This is the only direct citation from Ss?-ma Ch'ien's Shih-chi. It is from the introduction to ch. CXXIX, and appears much like a common saying. For , Huan K'uan has , which Chang suggests may have been in the original text of the Shih-chi. The latter part of the quotation is a paraphrase from the same chapter where "maids of Chao" , and "matrons of Chêng" also appear, the Shih-chi having , probably "singing girl", for the last character. Cf. Introduction for a discussion of this quotation. Hustling and bustling, after gain the world is rushing: Maids of Chao not particular as to beauty or homeliness; matrons of Chêng undiscriminating between foreigner and countryman; merchants willing to face dishonor and disgrace, soldiers not willing to serve to the death; officers, indifferent to relatives, in serving their Prince willing to face any risk at his expense; everyone and all working but for profit and salary. The Confucianists and the Mihists,2 2 . For ju see p. 38, note 9. The Mihists , with whom the ju are here grouped, were the transmitters of the doctrines of Mo-tz? or Mo Ti , a native of Lu, who lived in the Vth century B.C. He continued the teachings of Confucius with certain variations, notably with less predilection for the lessons of antiquity. He was opposed to music (holding it to be the origin of all the corruption and immorality of his time), as well as to prolonged mourning. The extant work associated with his name consists of 53 sections in 15 chapters, of which 10 sections (8—37) are held to emanate from the hand of the philosopher himself, and to present his actual teaching. Mo-tz?, unlike Confucius, did not justify his doctrines upon the authority of the ancient Sages, but upon logic. His fundamental principle was "universal love" , to which the ills of the world would respond. The success of Mo-tz? was largely due to his logical method of exposition, as exemplified in his writings. From this grew the various schools of sophists, who flourished in the IVth and IIIrd centuries particularly. Mencius was strongly opposed to the teachings of Mo-tz?, referring to him especially in the passage (loc. cit. III, ii, ix, 9—10): "If the principles of Yang and Mih are not stopped, and the principles of Confucius not set forth, then those perverse speakings will delude the people, and stop up the path of benevolence and righteousness" [Legge]. Elsewhere the Book of Mencius combats the principles maintained by Mo-tz?. While the school of Mo-tz? failed to survive the persecutions of the Ch'in empire, the dialectical methods developed by its adherents became the common property of Chinese thought, and thus continued to persist. Mo Ti and his school are treated at length by Forke in his Geschichte der alten chinesischen Philosophie, 368—417, and by Maspero, La Chine Antique, 468—479, 529—541. Translations of the extant Mo-tz? have been made by Forke, Mê Ti des Sozialethikers und seiner Schüler philosophische Werke, and in part by Y. L. Mei, The Works of Mo-tze. Hu Shih devotes Part III of The Development of the Logical Method in Ancient China to "The Logic of Mo Tih and His School". It is of interest to note the mention of representatives of this school as existing in Huan K'uan's time, in view of the belief (cf. Maspero, loc. cit.) that it did not survive the Ch'in era. Its gradual extinction in the Han era has been assigned especially to the opposition of the Mihist school to the rites or ceremonial. The Han epoch of reconstruction above all demanded formal rules for society. Thus the Mihists disappeared while the Legalists and Confucianists continued to contribute to Chinese societal development. Cf. Duyvendak, "Études de Philosophie chinoise", in Revue Philosophique, Nov.—Dec., 1930, pp. 372—417. with greedy hearts but 117 dignified mien, roam back and forth with their sophists' arguments. Their perching here and perching there1 1 Cf. Lun-yü XIV, xxxiv [Soothill]. "Wei-shêng Mou addressing Confucius said: Ch'iu, what are you doing with this perching here and perching there?" can also be explained by their appetite not being satisfied. For the scholar's want is also honor and fame; wealth and rank, the object of his expectations. h. When Li Ss? was studying at the door of Hsün Ch'ing, he rode side by side with ne'er-do-wells. Then, when he raised his wings in high flight surging forth like a dragon, breaking into gallop like a charger, "passing by nine and overtaking two," soaring to a height of ten thousand cubits, the wild swan and the fleet courser2 2 Hung-ku , mentioned in Mencius VI, i, ix, 3; Hua-liu , the name of one of the four fleet steeds of King Mu of Chou , driven by Tsao-fu (cf. p. 67) . Cf. Shih-chi, ch. V (Mém. hist. II, 5). The two allusions might be rendered in terms of European mythology as "Cygnus and Bucephalus". The Mu-t'ien-tz?-chuan , an account of the travels of King Mu, held to be a composition of a late period (IIIrd cent. A.D.), names eight horses. could hardly keep pace with him, to say nothing of lame ewes and finches and sparrows! Seated in the seat of power over all the Empire, driving the masses of the world before him, he enjoyed a retinue of a hundred chariots and an income of ten thousand measures, while your doctrinaire Confucianists can not have even a full suit of cotton clothes nor enough husks to fill their stomachs. Not that they find bean and legume tasty and hold 118 spacious mansions in low esteem, but they can never obtain the latter for themselves. Even though they would like to "shoo" at others, how can they do so? i. The Literati: The gentleman esteems virtue, the mean man dotes on land; the worthy scholar suffers martyrdom for his good name, the miser dies for gain. Li Ss?, coveting desirable objects, came to a hateful end, while Sun-shu Ao,1 1 , spoken of by Mencius, VI, ii, xv. "Thrice minister without elation; thrice he retired without regret" (Shih-chi, ch. CXIX). foreseeing early possible troubles, three times resigned from his Chancellorship and had no occasion for regret. Not that he found pleasure in stations low and mean, and disliked generous salaries, but he considered the distant future and took care to avoid all harm. The ox, reserved for the suburban sacrifice, is fed and taken care of throughout a whole year, before being bedecked in rich embroidery and led into the temple hall. Then does the Great Sacrificer seize his belled sword, about to part open its hair. At that moment, even if it wanted to be panting up a steep hillside under a heavy load, it cannot get its wish. j. When Shang Yang was hard pressed at P'êng Ch'ih2 2 [written in the Shih-chi, LXVIII], where the army of Ch'in defeated Lord Shang and slew him. Cf. ch. VII, supra. and Wu Ch'i3 3 , as related in the Shih-chi, LXV. For Wu Ch'i cf. Giles, Biog. Dict., no. 2320. cowered behind his prince's body, they undoubtedly wished they were in coarse clothes living in some wretched straw hut. When Li Ss? was Ch'in's Chancellor, seated in the seat of power over the whole Empire, a realm of ten thousand chariots would seem small to his ambition; but when locked in prison and finally when being torn apart by chariots in the market place of Yün-yang,4 4 , the modern Shun-hua-hsien in Shensi. The Shih-chi, Biography of Li Ss?, places the scene of his execution at the Ch'in capital, Hsien-yang . For "torn apart by chariots" , Ss?-ma Ch'ien has "cut in two at the waist" he also undoubtedly wished he were carrying wood to 119 Hung-mên1 1 . The Shih-chi, Li Ss?'s biography, reads . or walking through the crooked short-cuts of Shang-ts'ai,2 2 , Shang Yang's native city in Ch'u. but he could never get his wish. Su Ch'in and Wu Ch'i killed themselves by their power and position; Shang Yang and Li Ss? brought themselves to destruction by their prestige and honor; all of them came to their end through their greed and vanity.

The Lord Grand Secretary: Out of extreme probity Po I1 1 , by refusing to accept support from Wu Wang of Chou, whom he considered to be a usurper. starved to death and Wei Shêng2 2 , who "had made an appointment with a girl to meet him under a bridge, but when she did not come, and the water rose around him, he would not go away, and died with his arms round one of the pillars." Legge, The Texts of Taoism, Sacred Books, XL, 174 (Chuang-tz?). met his end through punctilious fidelity. Clinging to insignificant appurtenances, they sacrified great realities. Theirs was the petty fidelity of common men and women, who (show it by) committing suicide in some ditch, nobody being the wiser.3 3 Soothill, Analects, XIV, xviii, 3. Can achievement and fame be acquired in this manner? Su Ch'in and Chang I,4 4 , a Machiavellian pair who studied the sophistical art of "persuading any one to anything" under the Taoist philosopher Kuei-ku-tz? . They took up the adventurous career of itinerant volunteering diplomat. (Cf. Hirth, Ancient History of China, 285, passim). Ss?-ma Ch'ien devotes two chapters to their lives (Shih-chi, LXIX and LXX). See further note below. on the other hand, possessed wisdom equal to the task of making their countries strong, and daring sufficient to overawe their enemies. Let them once be angry, and all the princes are afraid. Let them live quietly, and the flames of trouble are extinguished throughout the Empire.5 5 Mencius III, ii, ii, 1 [Legge's translation]. For of the YTL. Mencius reads (cf. Legge's note). Mencius has Kung-sun Yen instead of Su Ch'in, which supports Maspero's opinion that Su Ch'in is a late creation, since he was unknown to Mencius. Cf. Le Roman de Sou Ts'in, in Études asiatiques publiées par l'École Française d'Extrême-Orient, II, 141. There was not a single ruler of a kingdom of ten thousand chariots who, bearing heavy gifts, sought not their friendship in abject attitude and with humble speech. 121 These were what we call world-famed scholars! But those whose wisdom is not equal to the demands of counsel, and whose authority cannot arouse their contemporaries, form the lowest class of men.1 1 , from the Lun-yü, XVI, ix. Now watch them take up Naught and consider it as Substance and as Fullness! Their plain clothes and torn sandals, their absorption in meditation and lingering walk, as if under the burden of some loss! Those are not scholars who can accomplish great things and establish a name for themselves; they do not even rise above the commonplace. b. The Literati: Su Ch'in, who won renown in Chao for his policy of Latitudinal Alliances, and Chang I, who obtained office in Ch'in by advocating a Longitudinal Bloc, were undoubtedly greatly esteemed at the time.2 2 See note 4, p. 120, supra. Of the authenticity of the deeds of these two diplomats of ancient China, Maspero opines (La Chine Antique, 405, note): "Tchang Yi est un personnage réel qui fut ministre au Ts'in de 328 à 312 [B.C.], et, chassé de ce pays, se réfugia au Wei où il fut bien reçu et mourut au bout de peu de temps; mais l'auteur du roman de Sou Ts'in, ayant fait de lui l'antagoniste de son héros, lui a prêté diverses aventures plus ou moins véritables, qui, recueillies dans le Tchan kouo ts'ö, ont passé ensuite dans tous les historiens." For the traditionally accepted story of Su Ch'in and Chang I, see Hirth, op. cit., 308—313. Yet wise men followed their careers with anxiety, knowing well that he whose advancement is due to complete disregard of right conduct, can not expect to retire by right conduct: and that which is not acquired in the proper way, is inevitably lost through improper ways. The power of the Chi and Mêng clans, and the wealth of the three Huan families, were high above ordinary achievement, yet Confucius once spoke of them, saying: Depleted are they!3 3 Lun-yü XVI, iii: "The revenue has departed from the Ducal House for five generations, and the government has devolved on ministers for four generations. That, alas! is why the descendants of the three brothers Huan are so reduced! [Soothill]." For the ducal families of Chi , Mêng , and Huan , cf. Legge, Confucian Analects, p. 19, note 2, et al. Such is the case of ministers who possess themselves of power equal to that of the prince, and wealth comparable to that of the state: they are doomed. Thus the higher becomes their position, the heavier and heavier become their crimes; and the more inflated become their salaries, the more numerous their misdeeds. 122 c. Now he who wants to follow the right path1 1 Hsing , the practical application of tê . first takes care to perfect himself, and only then seeks to establish his name; and he who intends to serve in an official capacity first takes pains to avoid all harm, and then applies for emolument. Undoubtedly scented baits are made as attractive as possible. Yet tortoises and dragons, let them but hear of these, hide themselves in the deep; phenixes, young and old, soar to the heights at the first glimpse of them, for they know well their life is in danger. When it comes to common crows and magpies, fishes and turtles, they swallow the fragrant bait,—then dash away in mad flight, shake their bodies,2 2 The text reads t'ou , "heads"; Chang's text more appropriately has shên , "bodies". exhausting themselves in an effort to escape, but nothing avails them against inevitable death. d. Our present jacks-in-office, having obtained a thievish hold upon the laws of the state, push forward with never a glance back at their path of crime. Sooner or later, the crisis will come; then shall we see the rush of chariots and the flight of men, — all of no avail against inevitable death. The accumulated plunder will be found insufficient to redeem them from the lot of the slave; their wives and children will find no sheltering place in their flight; while they themselves, locked in deep dungeons, will never know a glance of compassion. In those moments will they find time for mirth? e. The Lord Grand Secretary: Literary gentlemen of your type are lofty of purpose and righteous in conduct, in appearance unyielding as if no power could bend them; they are abounding in principle and spotless in speech, of immaculate semblance as if nothing could besmirch them. Yet consider for a moment Ch'ên Shêng,3 3 or , Ch'ên Shê, who rebelled against the Second (Ch'in) Emperor. Cf. Shih-chi, VI. the garrison soldier, who left off pulling carts to be the first to raise his head in rebellion and to establish himself finally as king of "Greater Ch'u". He had originally nothing in common, so far as righteous conduct is concerned, with such unoccupied 123 scholars as Yen Hui1 1 or , the favorite disciple of Confucius. Cf. Soothill, Analects, Introduction, 86. and Chung Yu,2 2 , also one of Confucius' disciples. Cf. Soothill, Analects, loc. cit., 79—81. , the name of a village , which was to the southwest of the secondary prefecture of Su , in Anhui province (Chavannes, Mém. hist., II, 235, note 2). Here Ch'en Shêng raised the standard of revolt against Erh-shih-huang-ti. nor could he be considered to have a position ranking with that of ministers of state or court officers. Nevertheless, within twenty days after his sudden rise at Ta-tsê,3 the Confucianists and Mihists, and all the besashed tribe of disciples, spreading out their long robes,4 4 is followed in the text by These last five characters are superfluous, according to Lu. and carrying on their backs the ceremonial articles and the Books of Poetry and History of the Confucian family, came to pledge themselves as his servants. K'ung Chia, who became mentor to Ch'ên Shê,5 5 The words occur in the preface to Shih-chi, ch. CXXI, ([] Shih-chi reading.) The preceding sentence seems also to be based on the same chapter. K'ung Chia is stated by the commentator Hsü Kuang to have been the descendant of Confucius in the eighth generation. finally perished with him in Ch'ên, the greatest laughing-stock in the Empire. Such is their kind: "hiding in the deep and soaring to the heights," indeed! f. The Literati: As the house of Chou degenerated, correct usages and right conduct were cast aside and could no more hold the world together. The feudal lords engaged then in a struggle of mutual extermination; kingdoms were destroyed or amalgamated, until but six of them were left.6 6 Cf. p. 43, note 1, supra. Wars continued unceasing and the people had not a single moment of rest. Ch'in, possessed of the voraciousness of a wolf or a tiger, one by one engorged the feudal lords, annexed and swallowed the warring states, and transformed them into mere provinces and districts. Making a display of his ability, proud of his achievements, Ch'in considered himself as having surpassed Yao and Shun, thinking it a disgrace to be even compared to them. Casting away all humane considerations and right 124 courses, he glorified judicial measures,1 1 Ch'in's acquisition of power, through Lord Shang's measures particularly, and its ultimate consolidation of the Empire, are discussed in ch. VII, supra. believing that for his time the arts of peace were no longer to be taken as a model, and that everything was now to be decided by warfare. With Chao Kao administering penitentiaries within, and Mêng T'ien carrying on war without,2 2 , the eunuch minister of Ch'in Shih-huang-ti; , the general conducting his campaigns. the masses groaned under their burden, and their hearts beat as one in hatred for Ch'in. g. Then King Ch'ên aroused them to show their claws and teeth,3 3 , i.e or , who raised the standard of revolt agains the Second (Ch'in) Emperor. Cf. Shih-chi, VI, and Chia I's forceful description of the means at Ch'ên Shêng's disposal, so insignificant in comparison with the great power of Ch'in (Margouliès, Le Kou Wen chinois, 61—63, "Dissertation sur les fautes de Ts'in'). and led the Empire in the revolution. Though baneful were his methods, some of the Confucianists and Mihists4 4 , cf. note 4, p. 116, and note 9, p. 38, supra. sought his patronage, believing that already too long was the time when there was no Prince in the world. The righteous Way had been blocked and barred to development ever since the time of Confucius down to that period; additional and heavy hindrances were now imposed by Ch'in, so in their exasperation,5 5 occurs in the Shih-chi, preface to ch. CXXI, where s?-ma Ch'ien explains why the scholars turned to Ch'ên Shêng. they turned to King Ch'ên. When Confucius said, If one be willing to employ me, may I not make an eastern Chou?6 6 Soothill, Analects, XVII, v, 3. he was intimating that he aspired to emulate the merits of Ch'êng T'ang and Wên and Wu in uprooting brutality and lawlessness for the sake of the masses. How could it mean that he was coveting emolument or seeking to enjoy high rank? h. The Lord Grand Secretary: In your words and actions, oh Literati, you have never reached the unwillingness to sacrifice principle of Hui of Liu Hsia,7 7 . "Hwuy of Lew-hea was not ashamed to serve an impure prince, nor did he think it low to be an inferior officer. When advanced to employment, he did not conceal his virtue, but made it a point to carry out his principles". Mencius, II, i, ix, 2 [Legge's translation]. though you may possess all the 125 fastidious honesty of a Po I.1 1 . "Pih-e would not serve a prince whom he did not approve, nor associate with a friend whom he did not esteem". Menciu , II, i, ix, 1 [Legge's translation]. You do not go beyond casting glances up and down, being pure in speech but foul in conduct. In the matter of a cup of wine or a dish of meat,2 2 Cf. Li-chi, Fang Chi , Legge, Books, vol. XXVIII, p. 286: "In the matter of a cup of wine and a dish of meat, one may forego his claim and receive that which is less than his due . . . ." you dawdle ceremoniously, yielding step one to the other, yet decline the lesser to snatch the bigger. Scruples of honesty worthy of a chicken, gullets worthy of wolves! Thus men of the type of Chao Wan3 3 , promoted in 151 B.C. as marquis of Chien-ling . Shih-chi IX. and Wang Tsang4 4 , who was favored by Han Wu Ti because of his proficiency in letters. Shih-chi XXVIII (Chavannes, Mém. hist. III, 461). He and the preceding Chao Wan were of special importance in the rôle of establishing the state religion under Han Wu Ti. Both were found guilty of extortionate practices and were ordered to their deaths. were boosted, thanks to their Confucian learning, to high ministerial rank, yet proved to possess ravenous and pitiless hearts. Chu-fu Yen's5 5 , a scholar who held high office in the Early Han period. glib tongue earned him high office and enabled him to usurp unusual power; he used it to prey upon the Imperial family and to extract bribes from the feudal princes. Finally they all met their death on the execution ground. Tung-fang So,6 6 , whose biography appears in the Shih-chi, CXXVI (cf. Giles, Chi. Biog. Dict., No. 2093), where his versatility, wit and dissolute private life, are equally described. who prided himself on possessing such power of argumentation that he could dissolve hard substances and split apart stones, had no peer among his contemporaries. Yet look at his private life where he did things that a madman would not think of doing. As to the rest of the lot who had not even his eloquence, they do not deserve a passing glance. i. The Literati: Those whose minds are set upon the good, forget the evil; those who are circumspect about details, extend the same care to important affairs. It is enough to watch one among sacrificial plates and dishes to judge his sense of propriety; it is sufficient to observe one in the privacy of the gyneceum to be able to appraise 126 his moral conduct. Among those who clothe themselves in the garments of the ancients and recite the moral teachings of yore, rare are they who do evil. Thus a real scholar and gentleman talks only at the right time and accepts things only when it is right to do so. He does not remain in possession of anything acquired not in a righteous way.1 1 Soothill, Analects, XIV, xiv. He is self-sufficing and never overreaching; dignified, and never overweening. j. We have for example, Yüan Ang,2 2 , whose biography appears in ch. CI of the Shih-chi with Ch'aò Ts'o's. He was a trusted councellor of both the Emperors Wên and Hsiao of the Early Han period. who gained the intimacy of the Emperor Ching, and whose stable, nevertheless, did not exceed a four-in-hand; Kung-sun Hung,3 3 . Also mentioned previously, cf. p. 63 and note 6. who with the rank of one of the three highest ministers, never had more than ten equipages in his household. Master Tung-fang, to whose advice the Emperer Wu lent his ear, and whose proposals he put into effect, was yet never overbearing or importunate. As to Chu-fu, he had known long days of misery and poverty. He hated4 4 . . . . seems to be out of place in this context, in Wang's opinion. those in higher places, who grew richer and more honored in spite of their lack of love for virtue, for their complete disregard of the fate of the scholars. He therefore used the surplus from the bounties that came in to him to supply the needs of indigent schoolmen. His intention was not to build up a private fortune. Do not blame the "chicken-honesty" of the scholars for the present clamor, but blame those occupying office who, like tigers with full bellies or gulping hawks,5 5 , a monstrous sea bird. search and look about so that nothing remains.6 6 This chapter (XIX) concludes chüan IV of the ten into which the sixty chapters of the Yen T'ieh Lun are usually divided. The only departure from this arrangement is that of Chang Chin-hsiang , whose edition of the chia-ching era of the Ming dynasty (1522—1566) has twelve chüan. See Introduction.</field>

LXV-1934, pp. 73-110) By ESSON M. GALE, Ph.D. Peter A. Boodberg, Ph.D., and T. C. Lin, Ph.D., collaborators. Chapter XX. MUTUAL RECRIMINATIONS. (a) The Lord Grand Secretary: When the ancients set as standard the Well-tithe System1 1 Cf. Discourses, II, p. 16, note 2. and put into effect regulations for homestead and hamlet, with every hearty fellow busy tilling his plowland and field and every wench tending her hemp and carl-hemp, no land lay fallow and no man drifted idly; none but the artizan and the merchant was allowed to live upon the increment of his capital, none but the sturdy husbandman to enjoy the fruit of his crops, none but those actually in control of administration, to taste of the corollaries of office and rank. But here we have now `Confucianists by profession'2 2 For the use of the term Confucianist cf. Discourses, VI, p. 38, note 9. See also . . K. Shryock, The Origin and Development of the State Cult of Confucius, Chap. VII. who, having laid aside plough and share, concentrate on learning to discourse on matters unproven and unprovable, wasting day after day and consuming 168 valuable time, without contributing in the least to actual working problems. They come and go in their aimless mayfly-like perambulations,3 3 As in Huai Nan Tz? often is equivalent to ephemerids, may-flies. upturning no soil for their food, rearing no silkworms for their clothing, but fraudulently impersonating people of station even unto encroaching on the farmers and encumbering the administration, yea, constituting a genuine cause for concern in our society! (b) The Literati: When, perturbed by the disaster of the Great Flood,4 4 Cf. Discourses, II, p. 17, note 2. Yü personally undertook the labor of dealing with it, wading through bogs and sleeping by the roadside, he never entered his home even when passing by its gate. In these moments, when he had no time to pick up a fallen hairpin or turn back for his hat forgotten where he had hung it, do you think he could find leisure to till the land?5 5 For the cycle of legends of Yü cf. Granet, Danses et legendes de la Chine ancienne, II, pp. 466-572. Cf. also Mencius, III, i, iv, 7. `Twas hateful to the poet who could not remain silent: `tis hateful to me, Ch'iu: I cannot conform,6 6 Quotation unidentified. Cf., however, Lun Hêng (Forke's trans.), ch. XXIX, 2 and K'ung Tz? Chi Yü , ch. V. exclaimed Confucius, so three score and ten times7 7 Cf. Shou Yüan, ; Huai Nan Tz? . he harangued the princes east, west, south, north, all without avail. Thereupon he retired and culutivated the Way of the Kings, composed the Ch'un Ch'iu and handed it down to posterity to serve as a criterion and standard for the world unto eternity. Would you deem that equipollent to common man and woman's farming and weaving? Should the superior man fail to move at the proper time, says the Chuan, there will be no pageant of edification for the people. Therefore, none but the superior man is to govern the common sort, as without the common folk there will be no one to support the superior man. The latter should not occupy himself in farming or weaving after the fashion of every Jack and Jane. Should superior men engage themselves in the cultivation of land to the detriment of their studies it would only point the road to anarchy.8 8 Mencius vindicates the propriety of the division of labor and of a lettered class conducting government in III, i, iv. (c) The Lord Grand Secretary: When discoursing on polity you are, Oh Literati, superior indeed to T'ang and Yü, and higher than the autumn sky when talking 169 honor. You certainly blossom forth in speech—but we have yet to see your fruits. In days of old when Kung-i was chancellor of Lu under the reign of Duke Mu, Tz? Ss? and Tz? Yüan served as his ministers, and lo! in the north, they ceded territory to Ch'i down to the line of the river Ss?, in the south, they cowered before the Ch'u barbarians, in the west, they paid homage to the state of Ch'in. When Mêng K'o took up his abode in Liang, the troops of that state were smashed by Ch'i, their high commander dead, their crown-prince, captive; to the west, they were defeated by Ch'in and were forced to abandon to the enemy frontier districts and relinquish lands to the extent of losing all the territory within the River and without.9 9 Cf. Mencius I, i, v, 1, (See Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. II, p. 134, note). Consider also Chung-ni's school, his seventy disciples,10 10 On the varying number of disciples attributed to Confucius see Legge, Chinese Classics, Vol. I, pp. 112-127. who abandoned father and mother, broke up home and family, and followed Confucius bag and baggage—they did not plow, they studied! and anarchy meanwhile increased apace. Therefore, with your chestful of jade chips do not deem yourselves possessors of treasures, nor regard yourselves as possessing Virtue through your droning of the Odes and the Historical Documents and your carrying books by the basketful. Our all-important task is to bring peace to the nation and prosperity to the people without further indulging in involved rhetoric and multifarious speeches. (d) The Literati: Just as Yü perished for not following Po-li Hsi's advice, so Duke Mu of Ch'in achieved the hegemony as a result of adopting it. As thus proved, doomed is he who employs not the worthy; would you then expect such an one to avoid cession of territory?11 11 This passage is taken from Mencius, VI, ii, vi, 4, with slight variations. When Mencius arrived at Liang, King Hui inquired of him on the way to profit, but he replied as to humanity and justice—they could not even come to terms, so Mencius finding no employment was forced to leave, hiding his treasure in his bosom and speaking no more of it.12 12 Cf. Mencius I, i, 1. The philosopher left Liang not because of the state of his relations with King Hui, but because the latter's son and successor, King Hsiang, was less favorably disposed to him. On see Lun Yü, XVIII, 1. Thus, it would not sate one's hunger, having grain and not partaking of it, nor does it repair loss of 170 territory, when you perceive a worthy yet not employ him. In Tyrant Chou's time there were at court the two viscounts, Chi and Wei, and Chiao Ko and Chi Tz? abroad, yet he could not keep them nor preserve his dynasty.13 13 Lu suggests changing to . Chi Tz? has already been mentioned, however and it is therefore hardly possible that he would have been spoken of again. The Hua pên writes "others." The context would rather require or in place of . Now, when you speak and they follow you not, you admonish, and they hear you not, though you be a man of superior talent, how can you prove to be of benefit to government? (e) The Lord Grand Secretary: All people find delicious the oranges and pumeloes that are grown south of the River, for all palates share the sense of taste; the lovely tunes produced in Chêng and Wei are enjoyed by all people for the sense of hearing is alike to all ears. I-wu, a man of Yüeh, and Yu Yü, a Jung [barbarian], could be understood only through interpreters, but both were highly honored, the one in Ch'i, the other in Ch'in, for in all men's hearts good and evil find the same response. Thus, when Ts?ng Tz? sang on the hillside, the mountain birds came fluttering down; when the music master Kuang stroked his lute, all the animals came dancing to him, for there never was excellence that met no response, and sincerity that found no answering call. May we not infer that there is lack of sincere purpose on your part? For what other reason could there be for no visible actualization of your speeches and your practices finding no meetness? (f) The Literati: A sick man adverse to needle or physic, P'ien Ch'iao himself would be unable to cure; a prince unwilling to swallow the bitter truth, the worthiest sage is unable to set aright. Thus, Hsia perished in spite of Chieh having Kuan Lung-fêng at his side, and Shang was extinguished, though there were three worthies with the Yin. We have no reason to deplore the lack of arguments such as were advanced by Yu Yü or I-wu; we regret only there is no one to give ear to them as Dukes Huan and Mu did. Thus it was that, went he east or west, Confucius found no favorable reception, and Ch'ü Yüan saw himself driven away from the kingdom of Ch'u, an exile. It has been said, therefore: If we do honest public service where shall we go and not be often dismissed? And if we are willing to do dishonest public 171 service14 14 The Chün Shu Chih Yao completes the quotation as in Lun Yü, XVIII, 2. ......to the end of our days, we may add, there will be no lack of `visible actualization' of such as our speeches would then be and no lack of `meetness to our practices.' (g) The Lord Grand Secretary: As a singer does not strive to reach high falsetto, but puts value in following closely the rhythm, so the expositor does not tarry to fashion beauteous periods so that he may concentrate upon the crux of matters under consideration. Though one may possess a good voice, he cannot be said to be a singer if he be ignorant of the principles of solfeggio, so likewise he cannot be considered as one able to discourse who, though he utter excellent words, is ignorant of the intricacies of exposition. You pick your compass and find fault with the square, clutch your water-level, but criticize the plumb-line, the single hole—you know it perfectly, the single vein or streak—you have investigated it thoroughly, but poise and scale is somewhat entirely beyond your knowledge. Like cicadas which never behold the snow, you refuse to believe others when it comes to things that are beyond your ken. Your sticking obstinately to ancient script and attempting to meet with it the requirements of the present age is just as incongruous as trying to bring Orion and Scorpio together and tuning a harp after having glued fast the pegs. You may try your hardest, you will find it still harder to make things fit. Thus it was that Confucius was found of no use by his age and Mêng K'o found himself slighted by the feudal lords. (h) The Literati: The sun and moon shine in splendour, but the blind see them not; thunderclaps resound, but the deaf hear them not. To speak for the benefit of those who know not rhyme nor reason, is but to talk to the deaf and mute, dumber than cicadas unaware of snow-drifts! Now, I Yin with all his wisdom, T'ai Kung with all his accomplishments could not make their words prevail before such as Chieh and Chou, not because of any error on the part of the speakers, but because of the default of the hearers. Thus Ching Ho clasped to his bosom his gem-matrix and wept bitter tears of blood, crying: `Where shall I get a master craftsman who will cut my stone?'; and Ch'ü Yüan roamed along the marsh side wailing: `Where shall I get a Kao Yao 172 who will decide my case?' There is no prince, we believe, who would not like to search out worthy men that they might assist him, who would not be glad to employ an able man that might bring good government to his state, but . . . . . . princes are misled by insinuations and beguiled by flattery. As a result worthies and sages are hidden from them as if with a screen while deceitful sycophants are in control of the business of state. It is due to this state of affairs that kingdoms go to their doom and ruling houses fall while worthies and sages live in indigence in their mountain caves. Formerly, Chao Kao, a man of ordinary wisdom, seated himself on the seat of power ten thousand fold beyond his ability, and consequently brought to its ruin the kingdom of Ch'in, the disaster engulfing him and all his family. He lost his "harp" entirely: what kind of "tuning with pegs glued fast" would you call that? (i) The Lord Grand Secretary: What we would call Literati of high grade are men whose wisdom and ability are equal to making illustrious the art of ancient kings, are men of parts and substance competent to walk in their path. Such would thus be able to become leaders and teachers of humanity should they remain at home, and a law and an example to the world should they be called to public service. But Literati of your type, such as we have with us to-day, sing the praises of Yao and Shun, when discussing matters of government, and talk of Confucius and Mencius when setting forth the principles of morals; let us but surrender to them some actual problem of administration, and they are unable to make any headway. While doting over the ways of the Ancients, you never succeed in putting them into practice; you speak straight, but make your path crooked; faithful in principle, you are faithless in spirit; in your robes and coifs you can be certainly distinguished from the villager, but in essence there is nothing that marks you off from the commonest sort. All your doctors, so-called straight and true, have merely grasped the lucky opportunity of the time in presenting themselves to make up the prescribed number; we cannot possibly term them enlighteningly selected. I see indeed no possibility yet to discuss with them intelligently the principles of government. (j) The Literati: Heaven set the Three Luminaries in order to lighten the course of time, the Son of Heaven established high ministers to make manifest orderly rule. 173 It is said, therefore, that the high ministers of state at once form the "contour" of the Four Seas and constitute the "coloring" of Spiritual Progress. Theirs is the responsibility of supporting the enlightened monarch's dignity above, and theirs the business of completing the work of His Sagely education below. It is they who bring Yin and Yang into harmony and attune the four seasons; they who bring peace to the masses and sustain all mankind, so that the Hundred Clans working in harmony may show no sign of frustrated aspirations and the barbarians on the four corners of the world, yielding meekly to Imperial Virtue, may give no cause for worry by a rebellious attitude. Such is the duty of high ministers and that which should engage the attention of those worthy of it, as were I Yin and Dukes Chou and Shao, talents equal to the demands of the offices of the Three Kung, and T'ai T'ien and Hung Yao, men able to fulfill the charges of the Nine Ch'ing.15 15 Three Kung , cf. Discourses ch. X, p. 62, note 4, Nine Ch'ing , ibid., ch. V, p. 31, note 5, including the Three Kung. Cf. Mayers, Chi. Reader's Manual. If we, the Literati have failed to come up to the mark in the Sage Monarch's enlightened selection, is it not also true that those now in control of administration cannot be said to possess overbounding virtue. (k) Displeased, the Lord Grand Secretary colored and made no reply. (l) The Literati: Eclipsed is the administration of a court when there is no loyal minister within it; tottering is the seat of a lord who has no honest vassal. After Jen Tso spoke straight and true of the faults of his prince, Marquis Wên mended his speech and conduct and came to be praised as a worthy prince; after Yüan Yang criticized Marquis Chiang's arrogance and haughtiness right in his face, the latter finished by earning great happiness thereby. Therefore, he who is constantly battering at the shortcomings of his lord, running straight into the danger of death, is a loyal servant; and he is a straightforward knight who dares to face an angry countenance in correcting the misdeeds of a high minister. Humble provincials that we are we cannot criticize you behind your back in our alley-asides. Now that the Ruler of Men has drawn his bow to full strength, that his instructions and regulations are taut and unslackened, we find that, in many cases salaries and emoluments are given to the wrong persons, so as to encumber farmer, 174 merchant and artizan alike; that market profits never revert to the people, whose expectations are not filled up. We find, moreover, that the principles of Emperor and King are mostly in decadence and are cultivated no more. Teeming, teeming are the knights at court says the Book of Odes.16 16 Shih Ching, IV, i, (i), 1. It is our earnest purpose that this plan be applied to remedy the situation; it is not that we insist merely upon pouring forth empty verbiage. Chapter XXI. HOW WAYS DIVERGE. (a) The Lord Grand Secretary: It has been your wont to tell us that the Seventy Disciples who received in person instructions in the science of the Sage and ranked so famous in the School of Confucius were all of the caliber that fitted them to become ministers and chancellors to the feudal lords, while several of them were qualified to sit facing the south as rulers themselves. For public administration, there were Jan Yu and Chi Lu; for oratory and dialectics, Tsai Wo and Tz? Kung.1 1 Cf. Shih Chi, Ch. LXVII, Preface.—Names of historical personages mentioned in the text are usually to be found in Discourses, Glossary A., Historical. Otherwise consult Chinese Biographical Dictionary (Shanghai, Commercial Press, 1921) or H. A. Giles, Chinese Biographical Dictionary (London, 1898). Tsai Wo, who obtained hold over affairs and enjoyed so great a favor in Ch'i, found, nevertheless, that his principles could not be put into effect when T'ien Ch'ang fomented trouble, and perished himself in the great courtyard, while his patron, Duke Chien, was being murdered in the T'an Tower.2 2 seems to be a mistake for (cf. Note in Shih Chi, 67, bio. of Tsai Yü). Tz? Lu took up service in Wei, but during the revolution provoked by K'uei he was unable to save his prince, and while Ch'u3 3 Ch'u evidently refers to Duke Ch'u, but the title Kung is unaccountably omitted. On the other hand ch'u cannot represent the verb as "to flee" as Tz? Lu is noted for loyally remaining at his post. Cf. Soothill, Analects, Intro., p. 80 for the episode, in which Tz? Kung and Tz? Kao also participated. Tso Chuan, Ai Kung, XV. fled Tz? Lu's 1756 body was embrined in Wei.4 4 Cf. Mo Tz? Cf. Granet, Danses, p. 166. Tz? Kung and Tz? Kao made their escape; they could not die for their prince in the hour of his peril. They enjoyed handsome salaries bestowed upon them, but were unable to requite their benefactor, sat in the honorable offices conferred upon them but proved themselves incapable to safeguard the interests of their patron. Why, pray, did they put so much stock in their own persons and so little in their prince's. Fellow-students and confrères, all these men thought themselves well-versed in the moral principles of ancient and modern times and able to make illustrious the decorous interdependence of prince and minister. Yet while some fittingly died, others sought safety in flight. These several gentlemen followed divergent roads. Wherein lies this contumacy to principle? (b) The Literati: Duke Shang5 5 is an obvious mistake for Shang, the duke of Sung murdered in 710 b.c. (Ch'un Ch'iu II). of Sung perished himself because of his failure to employ K'ung Fu earlier though he knew his great worth; Duke Chuang of Lu likewise knew the ability of Chi Yu, but surrendered him the administration too late to save his state from anarchy. The prince of Wei surrounded himself with specious flatterers and estranged men of talent; thus, Tz? Lu remained at P'u, while K'ung K'u was in charge of the government. Duke Chien paid no heed to Tsai Wo and let the latter's secret plans leak out. Thus it came about that the two princes suffered, one exile, the other death, and the disaster encompassed their faithful ministers. The other two gentlemen, though they had charges, yet were not given an opportunity to participate in their ruler's policies, they could die for him, but so could they also choose to live: whether they stayed or departed, their honor remained unimpaired. Yen Ying could not be termed disloyal to his prince when he did not die in the trouble of Ts'ui Ch'ing; and could Viscount Wei be said to lack in humanity when he fled the anarchy of the Yin? 6 I.e. Tz? Kung and Tz? Kao. (c) The Lord Grand Secretary: The unadulterated simplicity of the supremely beautiful nothing can embellish further; so no artificial elaboration can add a thing to supreme worth which holds fast to its essence. Thus a jade solitaire needs not be carved, nor a beautiful 176 pearl decorated with designs. Now, Chung Yu and Jan Ch'iu had not the toughness of hance timber, nor was the gem of their talent enclosed in a Sui Ho matrix; to spend one's efforts to embellish them would be similar to carving decayed wood or polishing a lead knife, to beautifying Mo Mu or painting a clay figure. Such as the latter though decorated with all the five colors would be resplendant enough as a finished product, but let him but come into contact with driving rain and raging waves then he will turn to slush. To dote too much on ancient principles with the Odes and the Documents for pillow and mat would bring no peace in moments of danger or good government in times of anarchy. You will find as much company with such methods as field watchmen chasing chickens. 7 Cf. Shuo Yüan (Confucius speaking): . (d) The Literati: If it were not for Learning there would be nothing wherewith to cultivate one's personality; nothing would sustain Virtue, if it were not for Propriety. The Empire's beautiful treasure was the jade-matrix of Ho Shih, but its beauty became manifest only after it underwent the skilled treatment of an expert gem-cutter. The most winsome in all the Empire was the Lady Mao, but her beauty become recognized only after she had made use of fragrant ointments and rich powder. The greatest Sage of the world was Chou Kung, but even he had to pass through the hands of virtuous teachers and a course of instruction before he became perfect. But at the present time we see mediocrities scarcely rising higher than the common level disdaining study and instruction and relying exclusively upon their stupid selves and yet taking upon their shoulders immense responsibilities. This course of action can only be compared with trying to cross river or sea without oar or rudder only to be carried away by the first encountered storm and sunk in an abyss a hundred fathoms deep or to drift eastward to the shoreless Ocean. From such a predicament do you expect to get away with only being a little "squashed"? (e) The Lord Grand Secretary: Things being flexible and inflexible in their very nature, beautiful and ugly in their permanent form, the sage man can only 177 follow the natural bent, he cannot hope to alter nature.8 8 Although such terms as and occur already in the I Ching (see ), they became popularized in Taoist ideology (cf. Lao Tz?, ch. LXXVIII). Confucius succeeded only in changing the outward dress of two or three of his disciples, he could not convert their hearts. Thus Tz? Lu unbuckling his long sword and doffing his bully's cap bent in low obeisance at the gate of the Master, but in his treatment of teacher and friends he continued in his boisterous ways and remained at heart a rowdy. Tsai Yü slept in the daytime and wished to shorten the three year long period of mourning. A wall of dirt is unfit for plastering, thereupon exclaimed Confucius, A man like Yu will not come to a natural death.9 9 Lun Yü, V, 9 and XI, 12. Hence, attempting to learn culture outwardly while lacking its essence within is like trying to paint on grease and carve in ice—though one may have virtuous teachers and excellent friends, it is nothing but a waste of time and energy. Thus the best teacher cannot improve upon Ch'i Shih, nor can most fragrant ointment transform Mo Mu. (f) The Literati: A country bumpkin would cover his nose at the sight of beauty covered with filth, but the homeliest man in gorgeous attire may serve in the sacrifices to Shang Ti. If these two men, Tz? Lu and Tsai Yü, had not passed through the school of the Sage, they would never have escaped the lot of the beggar; how would they have acquired their reputation as lords and ministers? As the whetstone is the wherewithal by which a blade is sharpened, so study is the means to bring out all the possibilities of latent ability. Said Comfucius: A Wassail-bowl that is not a bowl, what a bowl! what a bowl!10 10 Lun Yü, VI, 23. Thus if man apply himself to improve upon it, it will come to serve as a vessel in the ancestral temple; if not, then it must have an innate flaw in its grain. If a sword forged in Kan Yüeh remain unsharpened, the common man will disdain it, but after the craftsman has applied his skill to it, the ruler of men will put it on to appear at court. Now, an ugly hag under the impression that she is beauteous, will not try to embellish herself; a stupid fellow who deems himself wise will not study. Unbeknown to themselves, they make of their persons a laughing stock. Their fault lies in their disinclination to use the services of others and in trusting unto themselves. 178 Chapter XXII. IMPEACHING THE WORTHY. (a) The Lord Grand Secretary: Broken will be the inflexible, and bent, the flexible1 1 Cf. note 8, chap. XXI, supra. : thus Chi Yü died because of his stiff-neckedness, and Tsai Wo was murdered being yielding and weak. But if thes two men had not acquired learning, they probably would not have died their death. How so? Learning made them proud of themselves and boastful of their abilities; knowing little, grabbing much; wishing that men follow them and unable to follow others; self-admiring, when no one even glanced at them; self-appraising when no one even bargained for them. This is how they ended their lives by being murdered and finished by being embrined and enmarinaded.2 2 Cf. note 4, chap. XXI. The binom is usually translated "sliced to death." See Li Ling's "Letter to Su Wu," Giles, Gems (Prose), p. 85. We have not yet seen them made into "temple vessels," but we saw them utterly disgraced before the world. At that time would you also send them flitting eastward to find rest?3 3 Lu suggests reading for , seeing in the expression a reference to "Tz? Lu wishing to sail over the sea" (Lun Yü, V, vi). It appears, however, only a repartee of the Lord Grand Secretary to the Literati's attack in para. d, chap. XXI. (b) The Literati: When the noble steed hitched to a salt wain struggled up the slopes of T'ai Hang with bent head4 4 Supply after following the T'ai P'ing Yü Lan and the I Wên Lei Chü. The derivation of this apparent quotation has not been ascertained. It occurs frequently in later literature. the butcher cast glances at it, clutching his cleaver. When in dire poverty T'ai Kung was carrying his peddler's wares at Ch'ao Ko, the tousle-heads gathered in crowds to mock him. It was not that at that time they did not possess far-carrying sinews and the speed of fleeting coursers, but there were no Wên Wang or Po Lo who would recognize their worth. Tz? Lu and Tsai Wo during their lives did not happen to receive promotion at the hands of a Po Lo, but ran into a mad butcher. Hence the Superior Man sorrowed for them: A man like Yu will not come to a natural death. Is heaven thus afflicting me?5 5 . The first part of the quotation is from Lun Yü already noted; the second part from Kung Yang Chuan, Duke Ai, XIVth year. K'ung Fu was involved in the troubles of 179 Hua Tu, but he could not be said to be unloyal; Ch'iu Mu passed through the disaster of Sung Wan, but he cannot be said not to be worthy. (c) The Lord Grand Secretary: Among the scholars of to-day there are none with the ability of T'ai Kung or the innate capacity of a noble steed, but there are indeed wasps and scorpions that swollen with poison only harm themselves. Such were Ch'êng Hsiung of Tung Hai and Hu Chien of Ho Tung. From the ranks of common soldiers these two men were promoted for their learning to post of magistrates. Yet not only did they prove to be conceited and unwilling to cooperate with anyone, but called in, they would not come; pushed out, they would not go. Capering and flippant, stubborn and impolite, insolent lackeys to the princesses, and trespassers towards the high ministers, they tried forcibly to do what they knew was impossible. Their eagerness to make a name for themselves, led them into unlawful ways and sure enough they lost their lives. We cannot perceive their achievement to any extent, but we have witnessed their execution between the two pylons. Suffering the extreme penalty they could not finish their days in peaceful old age. Effrontery they took for wisdom, blazoning others' faults for straightforwardness, impudence for bravery.6 6 effrontery as in Lun Yü, VIII, 2. Cf. (K'ung-tz? Chi Yü, ch. III) . It is indeed proper that they should meet with calamity. (d) The Literati: These two honorable gentlemen had in their bosoms hearts of the purest whiteness and walked in the path of loyalty and uprightness; they cultivated straightforwardness in serving their superiors and strained their forces in making manifest the public good. Upholding law and promoting order, they did not favor relatives, nor put great emphasis upon safeguarding their wives and children, nor pay attention to the promotion of their private fortunes. Yet in the end they did not succeed in escaping from jealous and slanderous persons and succumbed to the pushing of the all too numerous `crooks.'7 7 The Chinese "crooked" bears out the translation. This is the explanation for unexpected penalties being heaped upon them and their achievements left incomplete. For when members of the reigning clan are not upright, then laws and regulations are not enforced; when the ruler's right hand men are 180 not upright, then treachery and evil flourish. When Chao Shê executed the law upon the lord of P'ing Yüan, and Fan Chü upon Marquis Jang, good government was preserved in the two states and at the same time both houses were kept intact. Thus, when the ruler commits a mistake, the minister should rectify it; when superiors err, inferiors should criticize them. When high ministers are upright, can magistrates be anything else? It is indeed highly remiss of you who are in actual control of administration to find fault with others instead of turning to examine your own persons. For Ch'ü Yüan's drowning in the deep can be traced to the slander of Tz?-shu, but that Kuan Tz? was able to put into effect his principles was due to the efforts of Pao-shu. At the present moment we cannot detect any efforts on the part of Pao-shu, but we envisage only the tragedy of the Mi Lo. Even though we would entertain the "finishing our days in peaceful old age," could we hope to realize it? Chapter XXIII. PURSUING THE WAY.1 1 "occurs everywhere with a moral application, meaning the way or course to be pursued, the path of reason, of principle, of truth, etc." Legge, Chi. Classics, Vol. II, Index III, p. 579. (a) Secretaries! called the Lord Grand Secretary, but before they could answer he turned to the Cancellarius2 2 , evidently a member of the Lord Chancellor's secretariat. and said: These Literati have been learning how to argue since they first tied their hair.3 3 Cf. Discourses, ch. XVII, p. 106, note 2. They are so surcingled with words you cannot tear them away from their periods which seem to run in circles and their roulades unstopping like the potter's wheel. Their tirades are as showy as the flowers of spring, but are as futile as an attempt to embrace the wind. They bedeck their emptiness so as to injure substance and discourse on antiquity to the detriment of things modern. If we follow them now, then the government will be deprived of its revenue, for their vacuous proposals cannot really be put into effect. If we do not adopt their plans, these 181 literati will continue to criticize us. For too long a time the din raised by this mob has been unbearable in the great metropolitan offices of the ministers. Now would you suggest a feasible plan that we could adopt so as to be in accordance with antiquity and at the same time clarify the present situation? (b) Then advanced the Cancellarius and said: Duke Wên of Chin was cunning but lacked uprightness, while Duke Huan of Ch'i was upright but never cunning. Their motives were not alike, yet both of them reached the goal of the Hegemony.4 4 Also popularized in English as "Protectorate." Cf. Discourses, Glossary, for the two names. See H. Maspero, La Chine Antique, Livre III, p. 281, Bib. and footnote; also p. 295, footnote. If one be obliged to follow old ways unswervingly and carry on old precedents unchangingly, then culture would never supplant crudeness and carts with rimless wheels would still be with us. Hence some create anew, while others transmit; then only can laws and regulations be consonant to the people's needs and instruments and implements expedient for use. Confucius6 6 The emission of . Confucius' title, is rather unaccountable here, as the sentence balance requires the additional character. There is, however, an element of disdain perceptible in the Cancellarius' words here, where he employs Confucius' well known expressions and "a transmitter not an originator," Lun Yü, VII, i. Yen Tz? is given the title as a successful administrator. in his interviews with the three rulers expressed different ideas and Yen Tz? adopted varying principles in serving as Chancellor to three princes; not that these two men insisted upon contradicting themselves, but that the exigencies of the times were different. Our lords high ministers have now already set out upon the road of the great undertaking and planted firmly the root of inexhaustible profit. I wish you would not hark back to minute analysis of antiquity and would cease dragging in your Confucianist and Mihist arguments7 7 The confusion in thought at this time is indicated by the coupling of Ju and Mo together when actually Mencius inveighed against the teachings of Mo-ti. It is thus difficult to believe with Shryock that Confucius was fully accepted in Han Wu-ti's time (loc. cit., Chap. III.) 5 Cf. Discourses, ch. VII, p. 43, note 2. (c) The Literati: K'uang, the Music-master, when harmonizing the pentachord never missed the sol-fa;8 8 "Kung Shang," the first two notes of the Chinese pentatonic scale. the sage Emperors never departed from charity and justice, 182 when they regulated the world. Thus, while there have been nominal changes in administration, there has never been with them any real change of principle. In the days of high antiquity, from the Yellow Emperor down to the Three Kings,9 9 Cf. Discourses, Ch. IV, p. 26, note 2. there was none who did not make illustrious his virtuous instructions, promote academies an? schools,10 10 Cf. Mencius I, i, III, 4; the preceding phrase is reminiscent of the Ta Hsüeh. exalt the charitable and the just, and establish firmly enlightenment and culture. That was the immutable law and principle for a hundred generations. By following them closely, the Yin and the Chou prospered, while the sovereign of Ch'in tampered with the laws and perished. When they spoke in the Odes, Though there be no old nor experienced men there are still code and statute,11 11 Shih Ching, III, iii, I, 7. they meant law and education. Thus, when these dèteriorate, they should be restored and systematized, and put into effect after systematization. What need is there to make them over again? (d) The Cancellarius: It does not profit one's appearance to talk of Hsi Shih's beauty, nor does discoursing on Yao's and Shun's virtues bring benefit to government. Now, O Literati, you tell us nothing of the means to achieve good administration, and talk only of the lack of achievement on the part of administrators; it is like saying nothing of the methods of cultivating land while keeping on admiring the stores and bins of the rich. For as he who desires grain should take cognizance of the seasons, so he who wishes good administration should follow the needs of the age. Thus, the Lord of Shang standing in splendid isolation, alone saw clearly the alternative between preservation and ruin, but found it impossible to cooperate with those who remained entangled with the ways of the vulgar because of their obstructing his achievements and their manifest shortsightedness. The mediocre man finds contentment in habit and usage, the foolish one sticks to his bit of learning. Thus as it took three years after the invention of boats and carts before people were taught to find satisfaction in them, so only after the Lord of Shang's laws were firmly established, the people learned to trust them. There are some with whom one can associate in 183 judgment.12 12 Lun Yü, IX, 29, considerably abbreviated. Indeed, O Literati, you can be entrusted with holding the builder's line and following already carved-out patterns, but surely not to take part in discussing aught beyond your own `principles and methods.' (e) The Literati: Wide in his knowledge, the superior man still maintains reserve as to lacunae in it; a transmitter and not an originator,13 13 Lun Yü, II, 18: "hears much, reserves whatever causes him doubt" (Soothill); and ibid., VII, i. though sage and perspicacious, he plans little, though wise and sagacious, he acts sparingly. Thus it is that his achievement is complete and falls not, his fame firmly established and dulls not. But the mean man, shallow in wit but large in plans, shoulders burdens too heavy for his debility and languidness, and thus finds himself forced to give up in the middle of the road.14 14 Lun Yü, VI, 10. Such ones were Su Ch'in and Shang Yang: they would have none of the laws of the former kings, they disregarded the ways of the Sages, and relied solely upon themselves—and so went to their doom. A mean man sitting in resplendent station says the Book of. Changes, will fall, high as he may be.15 15 This quotation has not been located. Of such there never has been one who ended his life peacefully when he strove not for fullness in principle and constancy in virtue. Thus though he might at first ascend to Heaven, he will fall to Earth. When Yü regulated the flood, the people' realized the benefit to be derived from his activities, and there was none who did not appreciate his accomplishment; when Shang Yang established his laws, the people knew the harm to be expected therefrom and there was none who did not fear punishment. Therefore, the prince of Hsia affirmed his achievement and achieved sovereignty, while Shang Yang perished as soon as his laws were put into effect. Like Shang Yang you may stand alone in the wisdom of your plans, but the world is not ready to bear witness to your `lonely' discernment; while we, the Literati, though we may be unworthy to associate with you in judgment of the present world, will also escape the calamity of being crushed under your loads.16 16 The policies of Shang Yang are discussed in Discourses, chap. VII, footnotes passim. 184 Chapter XXIV. ASSERTIONS AND ASPERSIONS. (a) The Cancellarius: As once said by Yen Tz?,1 1 The quotation is in a general way reminiscent of Yen Tz? Ch'un Ch'iu, Wai Pien VIII. The exact citation is not to be found in the present text. Note that for some of the Mihist themes Yen Tz? is quoted. For dating the Mihist school this is important as it would indicate that Yen Tz? represented the pure early Mihist school which had now become distasteful to officials (cf. coupling Ju and Mo together in previous chapter). Re Yen Tz? cf. Forke, p. 57, par. 2. Cf. also Mo Tz? par. 25 and 39. the Ritualists2 2 "the learned, the followers of Confucius, the orthodox, [Mencius] III. i. 5. 3: VII. ii. 26. i." Legge, Chi. Classics, Vol. II, p. 522. But cf. Discourses, p. 38, note 9; ibid., p. 66, note 1. For Les Ritualistes, see H. Maspero, La Chine Antique. are flowery in speech but short in fulfillment; meticulous as to music, but lax as to the people's needs. Prolonging mourning even at the cost of the living, lavish in funerals so as to injure livelihood3 3 The familiar phrases of Mo-tz? are here used. ; their rites are so perplexing as to be difficult of execution and their ways so devious as to be difficult to follow. Singing the praises of days past and gone, they speak maladvisedly of the present. Disparaging everything they see, they only treasure what they have heard; holding all men as being fundamentally crooked, they deem themselves straight as a rule.4 4 of the text is changed to . The aphorism here follows the theory of Hsün Tz? that the nature of man is evil; such evil nature can be rectified only by the practice of i (righteousness) and li (ceremonies), as performed by the ju. Cf. Hsün-tz?, chap. 17. Cf. Maspero, op. cit., p. 568. Thus it was that Yen I came to be executed and degraded and Ti Shan found death at the hands of the Hsiung-nu. Occupying such positions as they had and yet finding fault with the court, living in their age and yet backbiting their superiors, (it is only too natural that) they ended by being disgraced and ruining their lives. Well now, is there any one among you who would have taken up their burden and shared their tragedy? (b) The Literati: That which keeps moral laxity in check is Good Form (li),5 5 The terminology of Confucius and Hsün Tz? is here employed. For the stereotyped expressions for li and i an attempt is made to use English synonyms to indicate the extensive connotations of the Chinese terms. and Music is the wherewithal 185 by which morals are improved; it is when Etiquette (li) is flourishing and Music is orthodox, that penalties and punishments are undeviating. Hence, just as people never suffer from floods when the dams and dikes are kept whole, so there are never revolutionary disturbances among the people whenever decorum and justice take root. We have thus never heard of a case when good government would be attained with Decorum (li) and Justice (i) laid low and dikes and dams broken through. Speaking of Good Form (li) Confucius said6 6 Lun Yü, III, 4 (Soothill). : In ceremonies in general, it is better to be simple than lavish; and in the rites of mourning, heartfelt distress is better than observance of detail. It is clear that it was far from being the intention of those who created the rites to injure human lives and impair business; dignified carriage and self-possessed gentility were surely not intended to bring confusion into ethics and deprave morals. A well-governed state is careful as to its ceremonial; a tottering one is diligent in the application of its laws. Remember ancient Ch'in which swallowed up all the Empire by force of arms, how its disasters were aggravated by the monstrous vagaries7 7 As enumerated in the celebrated essay of Chia I. Cf. Chia-tz? Hsin Shu, chap. I, Kuo Ch'in. of Li Ss? and Chao Kao. Then it was that we saw the ancient arts abolished and the time-honored ceremonies fall, all reliance put into penal laws and the Confucian and Mihist doctrines passing completely into obscurity.8 8 Despite Mencius' reprobation of the doctrines of Mo Tz?, the Ju here associated them with the teachings of Confucius. Cf. notes supra. Blocked was the path of the scholar and gagged the mouths of men. Daily the flatterers forged ahead and those on high never heard their mistakes criticized. This was how Ch'in lost the Empire and brought to ruin its own sanctuaries! It fell out therefore for the sages who strove to restore order first to mete out punishment for those men who by their cunning and artful words so propped up wrong that it entailed the collapse of the nation. Now, you, sir, whence come you with your store of aphorisms that spell the crack of doom for the state? You, the high ministers, occupying such a post, you give no thought to rectifying your ways, but have all your mind on aye-ayeing 186 your superiors, cringing before their slightest frown or promptly trimming your sails before their wind. 'Tis hateful to us to see such low-fawning and about-facing worthy of the meanest man which leads only to fortify those whom you serve in their faults. Therefore, though we know well these words may cost us our lives, we cannot suffer to be led into your train, O tribe of compromisers, yea, spare us not your fetters and chains! Ah, woe! (c) The Cancellarius: One is sure to find a village where there are spreading trees; an everglade, where there are rushes: this expresses well the affinity of homogeneous things. Virtue never dwells alone, said Confucius, it always has neighbors.9 9 Lun Yü, IV, 25 [Soothill]. Thus, rises a T'ang, lo! there enters I Yin, and exeunt the wicked. There has yet to be a case when evil ministers kept their places below when an enlightened monarch sits on high. Now, the late Sovereign10 10 Han Wu Ti (). For an account of the part taken by this Emperor in promoting scholarship, cf. Shryock, The Origin and Development of The State Cult of Confucius, chap. III, "Han Wu Ti and the Confucian Triumph." himself started on the way of charity and wisdom when he undertook the task of ruling all within the seas: he summoned and selected scholars of supreme ability and excellent worth so as to insure that none but the good would find employment; in pursuing and chastising evil ministers he did not spare even those closest to him. He made every effort to seek out the worthy and expel the incapable, just as Yao did promote such as Shun and Yü, and executed K'un and exiled Huan-tou. With all that you refer to us as being a "tribe of compromisers"! If this be true then should it not be indeed a case of ministers aye-aye-ing an erring ruler? 11 This doubtless refers to the revolt and subsequent death of the crown prince Chü, son of the Empress Wei. The former was charged by Chiang Ch'ung with having cast a spell on the Emperor. Chiang Ch'ung was first killed by the prince who himself was slain. Other members of the Imperial family were implicated. Cf. Discourses, Glossary, p. 132 sub Chiang Ch'ung. (d) The Literati: Said Kao Yao in reply to Shun: It all depends on knowing the people, which is considered hard even by the Emperor.12 12 Based on Shu Ching, the Counsels of Kao-yao, I, 2. During the time of the Great Flood, Yao stood alone aggrieved and worried not knowing how to regulate it; but once he obtained the services of Shun and Yü, the nine provinces enjoyed 187 peace. Therefore, even if there is an enlightened Monarch like Yao, his pure virtue will not prevail unless there are assisting hands like Shun's and Yü's. The Spring and Autumn criticized the fact that there were rulers, but no ministers. During the time of the late Emperor, there was no sufficient number of good ministers and hence the evil ones got their chance. When Yao got Shun and Yü, K'un was killed and Huan-tou was executed; when Chao Chien-tz? got Shu Hsiang, Shêng Ch'ing-chien was dismissed.13 13 Shu Hsiang was not a contemporary of Chao Chien-tz?. Cf. Discourses, Glossary of Names. The case is well stated in the proverb: Until one sees the virtuous, one does not recognize a traitorous minister, or in the words of the Odes: When I do not see the virtuous, my heart is full of worry. When I have seen the virtuous, my heart settles down.14 14 Shih Ching, II, i, VIII, 5. But see Legge, Chi. Classics, Vol. IV, part II, p. 264, for a different rendering. (e) The Cancellarius: Yao employed K'un and Huan Tou, but exiled one and executed the other when he got Shun and Yü. He exiled or executed them because of their guilt, and hence in the Empire all yielded to him for he had punished its evil ones. The ruler of men looks for service among the common people. Yen I was a police constable at Chi Nan. The late Emperor promoted him and bestowed on him a high position, until he reached the rank of Superior Minister. Ti Shan rose from the plain-clothed to the post of Councillor to the house of Han. They both occupied the position of Shun and Yü and held the central power of the Empire. They were unable, moreover, to achieve anything conductive to good government but on the contrary were found guilty of criticizing the Emperor. Hence the punishment inflicted on Huan Tou was imposed on them and even more, they suffered the extreme penalty of the law. The worthy receive their reward while the inferior suffer their punishment. This is certainly just. Why wonder then, O Literati? (f) The Literati: Parties to a discussion should support each other with reason and admonish each other following logic; in striving after the good not seek victory, and in yielding to reason, not feel shame at being worsted. If we try to confound each other with 188 falsehood, and confuse each other by rhetoric, each side priding itself on having the last word, each striving after victory at any cost, this would be destroying all the value of the debate. Now, Su Ch'in and Chang I completely dazzled and befuddled the feudal lords, but upset The Myriad Chariots15 15 "the sovereign's domain = 1,000 li square, produced 10,000 war chariots." This was the ideal of the early Chou. Here doubtless in the Chan Kuo period, it represents a feudal state of the first rank. and caused rulers of men to lose their grasp: they were certainly eloquent, but theirs was the path to anarchy. The Superior Man decried the impossibility to serve one's prince along with servile fellows, for he feared that should they obtain a hearing there would be no length to which they would not go.16 16 Paraphrase of Lun Yü, XVII, 15. Now, sir, you do not want to heed the dictates of Right and Reason so that you may fittingly assist the minister and the Chancellor, but only follow and meekly obey your masters. You love to make extemporary speeches and never weigh their consequences. If we be judges of your qualifications as a subordinate officer, it would seem meet to confer upon you the highest penalty. Keep your peace, sir, for the time being. (g) The Cancellarius17 17 . . . Chang's ed. puts this whole paragraph at the beginning of the next (XXVth) chapter. : Scholars living in this world, so have I heard, should have enough clothes to cover their bodies and enough food to be able to supply their parents. At home, they should possess sufficient means to take care of one another; abroad, they should depend on no one. One is in a position to undertake the responsibilities of a family only after one has proved to be able to care for himself; is in a position to take up office only when his family is well managed. Hence he who feeds on coarse grain is not fit to talk of filial piety, and he whose wife and children are hungering and cold is unfit to talk of compassion, while he who has established no permanent business is not fit to discuss real problems. These three handicaps, which you, living in this world and maintaining this bodily existence, seem to share, appear to me amply sufficient to make you hold your peace. 189 Chapter XXV. FILIAL PIETY AND FILIAL SUPPORT. (a) The Literati: He who supports his parents best does not do so necessarily with fat viands, and he who clothes his parents best does not do so necessarily with rich embroideries. The consummation of filial piety lies in dedicating everything one has to the service of his parents: thus the commonest man with his sheer labor and industry may still have ample means to fulfill the rites, and the poorest man whose food is pulse and water his only drink can still adequately express his reverence. The filial piety of the present day, said Confucius, merely means to feed one's parents . . . . . . but without reverence wherein lies the difference?1 1 Lun Yü, II, 7 (slightly abbreviated). The highest filial piety consists, therefore, in nourishing one's parents' ambition, next comes nourishing their passing whims, and then only nourishing their bodies.2 2 Mencius, IV, 1, xix, discusses the correct manner of serving parents. The value of filial piety lies in the form, not in being bent upon mere providing. If everything is in accordance with form and hearts are in harmony, one can be counted as filial even though provisions are not complete. The eastern neighbor slaughtering a cow, says the Book of Changes, is not the equal of the western neighbor performing the sacrifice.3 3 I Ching, hexagram 63. Thus though rich and prominent one may be, if he is without propriety he is not the equal of one who is filial and brotherly, though poor and humble. Within the inner apartments, fulfill filial piety to the end; without them, fulfill brotherly love; in journeying with friends, fulfill trust. These three things are the consummation of Hsiao . The founding of a home or a patrimony does not mean mere accumulation of wealth; discharging one's filial duties in serving one's parents does not mean merely supplying them with fresh foods. All depends, on the other hand, on following their smile or frown, conforming to their wishes and fulfilling all the rules of propriety and justice. (b) The Cancellarius: At the age of eighty a man is called a t'ieh, at the age of seventy he is a mao. A 190 septuagenarian4 4 . According to the Shuo Wên (I-II cent. a.d.) the mao is a nonagenarian. The Li Chi, ch'ü li 7, 27, makes the mao a man from 80 to 90 years of age [Legge, Sacred Books, Vol. XXVII, p. 66]. does not feel full without meat nor warm without silk. Sweet and rare food for their palates, a pious son would say therefore, clothes warm and light jor their bodies!5 5 A quotation of unknown provenience. The first quotation of is ascribed to the Shih Chi in the K'ang Hsi Tz? Tien. Tsêng Tz? must have had wine and meat to support Tsêng Hsi.6 6 Mencius, IV, 1, xix. Without his cap properly adjusted Kung-hsi Ch'ih himself would be unable to discharge properly his duty of sustaining his parents, but without rich and savory fare, be he Tsêng Tz? or Min Tz?, one cannot fulfill to the end this duty. Form is not an empty cloak: there must be substance before it is made into the father-son relationship. Rather be superfluous in provision and deficient in etiquette than abundant in etiquette and deficient in provision. I cannot see any value, however perfect be the execution of rites, in meticulously washing the cup in order to fill it with mere water, and ascend and descend steps ceremoniously only to present coarse and unhulled rice. (c) The Literati: Not without wines and meat was the Chou Emperor Hsiang's mother; her food and clothes were certainly incomparable to those of a Tsêng Hsi. Yet that Emperor earned the notorious reputation of being unfilial, for he was unable to serve his mother properly. The Superior Man puts value on the form of performing filial duty, but the mean man is only bent on provisions. Now if you beckon to one with a `Hi, come hither' and throw him the food, be he a mere beggar, he would not take it.7 7 Cf. Mencius, VI, i, X, 6, Though the food be delicious, the Superior Man8 8 Cf. Lun Yü, X, 8, the famous chapter descriptive of Confucius' idiosyncracies. would not partake of it if the rules of propriety are disregarded: thus no guest would take part in the sacrifice, if the host neglects to prepare the offering personally. This proves that Form is the thing that counts, the food offering is of slight consequence. (d) The Cancellarius: Among filial sons there are no greater than those who put to the disposal of their parents the entire Empire or a whole state; next come those who sustain their parents with their salary; then those who nourish them by the fruit of their labor. 1917 Thus, king, duke and ruler of men stand highest in the list; next to them, ministers and officials. Now let us examine how it is done in one or another family. There are worthy sons among those on the road to power over this world who supply their elders with high halls and spacious chambers, comfortable carriages and big horses, light and warm clothing, and sweet and tasty food. There are others who clothe them in coarse stuff and leather caps, leave them to dwell in beggar's alleys, provide them for the day, but not for the morrow, with the coarsest grains and vegetables for food, with a chance to see meat but on the fall and winter sacrifices.9 9 "winter sacrifices." This passage is cited in the K'ang Hsi Tz? Tien, explaining lou as the sacrifice of the 8th month. It is apparently not known otherwise. The la is the Han dynasty name of the sacrifice of the last month of the year, giving the common name to this month. For the la sacrifice under its earlier name cha cf. Legge, Sacred Books, Vol. XXVII; Li Ki, Books I-IX, p. 431. They upset their aged parents' stomachs, stuffing them with salads, as if they were truck gardens. Now, when a son feeds his parents with the coarse foods that a beggar would not take, though he wished to do it with all ceremony, there would be no virtue whatever therein. (e) The Literati: He who steals his position possessing no ability to occupy it and he who accepts salary having no achievement to his credit, though he possess wealth and honor, can only offer to his parents the aliments of a Chih or a Ch'iao. Though his high terraces might command a distant view and his dinner table might be laid out to cover one hundred square feet, he still cannot be termed filial. One's aged parents' stomachs are not bags for the loot of thieves, why then always try to fill them with things obtained through disregard of principle? Now if you take unproperly-won things and positions, calamity will follow wherever enters ill-gotten gain. The very lives of your parents are liable to be engulfed in your calamities, how could they hope then to eat meat at the fall and winter sacrifice? Tsêng Shên and Min Tzu had the reputation of filial sons though they never had aliments of ministers or chancellors; while Emperor Hsiang of Chou with all the wealth of the Empire at his disposal became notorious for being unable to serve properly his parents. Therefore, it is not filial piety to offer rich nourishment with scant ceremony and though one may thus deplete all his stores in order 192 to feed his parents, it still will not be filial piety. (f) The Cancellarius:10 10 has been supplied following Chang's edition. The (Lord) Chancellor does not appear as active participant in the debate until Ch. XXIX. Those that stand highest in the performance of filial duty wait upon their parents' countenance; next come those who give them security; then those who are careful to preserve their lives.11 11 "Now filial piety is the root of (all) virtue, and (the stem) out of which grows (all moral) teaching. . . . Our bodies—to every hair and bit of skin—are received by us from our parents, and we must not presume to injure or wound them:—this is the beginning of filial piety." Hsiao Ching, I [Legge, Sacred Books, Vol. III, p. 466]. Formerly Ch'ên Yü turned against the Han and was beheaded on the banks of the Chih and Wu Pei by his seditious activities caused the extermination of all his family. More recently, Chu-fu Yen was executed for non-conformity and Lü Pu-shu met death and disgrace through playing too freely with his tongue. All these men were so careless in their conduct that the penalties they suffered extended to their innocent parents. It can be easily seen from their example that empty form is of no profit to one. As culture and substance go hand in hand, so etiquette and nourishment should both be dispensed at the same time, only then can one be termed filial. Filial piety lies in material things, not in meritorious appearance. Preservation of life depends on circumspection, not in running wild with words. (g) The Literati: He is the most unfilial of all who speaks without sincerity, makes promises but does not keep them, shows no courage in the face of difficulties, and no loyalty in serving his prince. Said Mencius: The officers of to-day, the ministers of to-day are all criminals12 12 Paraphrase of Mencius, VI, ii, 7. for they all conformed to the prince's whims and connived at his evil acts. Now, you sir, are one devoid of loyalty and faith, bringing confusion into the administration with your artful speeches and seeking to obtain favor with your proposals of a sycophant. Indeed, such as you are not to be tolerated in this world. Unwavering in holding to the unity of principle is the scholar, says the Spring and Autumn, unmindful of anything outside his loyalty to the Right.13 13 A quotation of which the location cannot be found. He should concentrate all his efforts on nothing but the performance of his official duties. Thus, it is a crime to speak high, while 193 one's position is lowly, and it is impudence to talk out of turn. The Imperial edict directed the high ministers to take part in this debate and you take time for waging your empty verbal battles. Chapter XXVI. CUTTING EXCHANGES. (a) The Cancellarius: Would a heaped-up tumulus in seeking to reach a stately height reject an extra cubit of earth1 1 . . . According to Chang read for and for as making better sense. chiao to be taken in the comparatively rare sense of "peak of a hill," kuei as half a pace. Cf. Li Ss?, On the Employment of Foreigners: "Not a single clod was added to T`ai-shan in vain; hence the huge mountain we now behold. The merest streamlet is received into the bosom of Ocean; hence the Ocean's unfathomable expanse." Giles, Gems (Prose), p. 53. ; would a superior man in seeking to widen his reputation disregard the words of an humble faggotcarrier? For he is widely versed who has observed much, and he is wise who much has retained; clogged the mind of him who is adverse to censure and friendless he who puts trust solely in himself. Hence he will never be remiss who seeks counsel even unto the lowest of the lowest, and undulled in his achievements he who seeks suggestions even among the commons as says the Book of Odes: Go thou to the humble shepherd and woodcutter.2 2 Cf. Shih Ching, III, ii, X, 3. Now since plain-clothed people are all given freedom to vent their opinions, how much the more should not I, a secretary to my lords, the high ministers, also be allowed to do so? It is true that the Spring and Autumn does not record the deeds of mere scholars, yet it notes the fact that a certain Huan acted as steward.3 3 Cf. Ch'un Ch'iu, Yin I: "En automne, au septième mois de l'année, Hiuen, ministre et envoyé du souvereign établi par le ciel (l'empereur P`ing ouang) vint à Lou offrir des voitures et d'autres présents pour les funérailles de Houei Koung et de sa femme la princesse Tchoung tseu" [Couvreur]. Although they do not engage me in office, said Confucius, yet 194 I should have been consulted about them.4 4 Lun Yü, XIII, 14. Omit which apparently crept in under the influence of [Soothill]. However incapable is my humble self, I, too, have inclined my ears to hear instructions, holding up my skirts, have submitted to a teacher's directions and have joined a school to learn how one should walk in the superior man's path. If what you, Literati, have said is right, then what harm can the words of my humble self do? If what you said is wrong, who could refrain to say it is wrong, though he be an insignificant cancellarius? (b) The Literati: Assisting men in righteousness is called loyalty, but misleading people into evil is treachery. He who grieves at his master's faults and approaches him with good advice, is a loyal minister to his prince and a true vassal of his lord. Let a lord have three blunt , said Confucius, and that lord will never lose his patrimony though he be devoid of principle.5 5 Hsiao Ching, ch. XV. But you, sir, holding now the rank of a steward, you have a heart where no feeling of loyalty or right is present. It is beyond your power to straighten out the crooked, or rectify the evil. You follow the current to safeguard yourself, and bow to the wind to please your superiors, blindly accepting what your superiors declare and deviously following them in what they practice, like a shadow pursuing its body and an echo repeating a sound, never being able to distinguish right from wrong. You have donned the Confucian dress, capped yourself with the Confucian cap but you will never be able to follow in the Confucian path. You are no true `Confucian!' Not unlike a painted clay dragon with head and eyes complete in every detail, but which is only a mock dragon. The shepherd's purse looks like a vegetable, but is quite different in taste; jade and stone look similar but differ in kind. You are not a Confucian who, after Master K'ung, clings to the Classics and holds fast to principle, you are of those Confucianists lowly about facing and fawning upon the ministers; you are none of our kind. Said Confucius when Jan Yu became steward to Chi Shih and kept on still increasing his income: You may beat the drum my sons and attack him.6 6 Lun Yü, XI, 16 (Soothill). We do not hold, therefore, a helper of Chieh for wise, nor Chieh's tax-gatherer for altruistic. Silenced, the Cancellarius made no reply. 195 Chapter XXVII. SHRILL POLEMICS. (a) The Lord Grand Secretary: It is because of his solicitude for the myriads of his subjects and the deep concern over the continuing unrest on the Northern frontier that the Enlightened Monarch, the molder of his age, sent out envoys to seek out worthies and literati of high grade and to make diligent inquiries after scholars of high principle.1 1 Cf. Discourses, chap. I, p. 1, note 4. His wish, meseems, was that diverse proposals and various plans be submitted to him so that he might with unprejudiced mind lend an indulgent ear to the most feasible. But there is no one among you doctors, who has been found able to advance a plan outof-the-ordinary or a far-reaching scheme respecting the questions of the Hsiung-nu and the pacification of the borderland. Clinging2 2 For read following the I-lin . On this work see P. Pelliot, T'oung Pao, Vol. XIX. to your rotting bamboo slips and holding fast to your empty words, you never want to recognize the necessity of coming to terms or the imperative need of changing with the time. You hold to no firm basis in your discussions, reminding one of persons scratching their backs when their knees are a-itching. Unbearable is the din of brawls you raise by your railings at the Portals of the Commonweal. As if your orchestrated vociferation will ever bring practical result! Do you wish us to believe that this is what the Englightened Monarch desired to hear? (b) The Literati: All of us in submitting respectfully our proposals have reached one conclusion though following different channels.3 3 cf. I Ching . Our proposals all point to the necessity of re-establishing Form and Justice on the pinnacle by relegating monetary gain, of reviving the principles of old so as to rectify the mistakes of the present day. There is not a single one of them which does not spell a universal peace. We realize, of course, that all of these proposals cannot be actually put into practice, yet it would seem to us that at least some could be effectuated indeed. On the other hand, you, having control of affairs, prefer to remain in the darkness in the face of the illustrious practices of conformity and 196 get your only cue from mercenary preoccupations; it is through your obstructionism, censoriousness, your manoeuvring and subterfuges that no decision has been reached even until now. It is not that the Confucianists can never achieve practical results, but that you, high ministers of state, are too engrossed in achieving practical profits.4 4 Chang's ed. has following . It seems to be required by parallelism and by the occurrence of a similar expression in the Ta-fu's reply [14b]. (c) The Lord Grand Secretary: Confounders of truth you are, O Literati, with your flinty faces and mushy hearts, corrupt to the core with your pompous appearance and pliant insides! You plagiarize Chou Kung in your dress with all these well-cuffed robes and loose belts, plagiarize Chung Ni in your appearance with all these low-crooked courtsies and mincing steps,5 5 cf. Lun Yü X, 2, 4. plagiarize Shang and 6 6 Apparently Tz? Hsia and Tz? Kung . in your oratory with all this crooning and sententiousness. Discussing politics—you pasquinade, O talents superior to Kuan (Chung) and Yen (Ying)! belittling ministers and Chancellor in your hearts, determined to slight the Myriad Chariots. Should we intrust you with practical problems of administration you will bring nothing but confusion worse confounded and complete misgovernment. Indeed recommending such men on the strength of their words is similar to appraising a horse by its coat only. I have demonstrated here sufficiently whereby most of you do not deserve the recommendation you have received. The edict quotes: `Greatly gratified by the scholars of Our domain, We intend to search out diligently such of them who by their great worth, literary knowledge and wide experience can quickly be given official posts7 7 Lu suggests for is also the reading of Chang's edition. This passage is not found in the edicts of the Ch'ien Han Shu, referred to in Discourses, chap. I, p. 1, note 4. .' But—fine talkers are not necessarily possessors of moral excellence. Preposterous? To talk is easy, 'tis difficult to act.8 8 an aphorism frequently repeated by the late Dr. Sun Yat Sen. We should prefer to take cognizance of the dumb ox and discard the squeaking cart, for the former is to be prized for accomplishing much while talking little. Just as the great bell of Wu by wagging its own tongue smashed 197 itself, so Chu-fu Yen by wagging his caused his own death. Master Chu-fu's owl screeches proved of no avail against impending death just as the nightingale's night songs do not prevail against the dawn's first light. 'Tis not that we public officials are too engrossed in seeking profit, but you rather are too well manacled to the yoke of obsolete practices which drags you into idle talk. (d) The Literati: T'ang and Wu (Wang) were men who could talk as well as act, but you bureaucrats can but talk, not act. If we have purloined the dress of Chou Kung, you have stolen his position; if we are manacled to the yoke of obsolete practices, you are fettered to that of pelf and profit; if Chu-fu Yen may have caused his own death by wagging his tongue, you have penned yourselves in by wagging after profit. Now we hold that none but Tsao Fu can so bring out the latent talent of a noble steed that it will run for a myriad li; if it were not for Shun who made him his minister, Yü would never have seen employment though in wisdom he was one in a myriad. Thus when a Chi Huan-tz? sits in control of the administration such as Hui of Liu-hsia suddenly vanish from sight,9 9 Huan-tz? and Liu-hsia Hui were not contemporaries. Can the original saying be that in Huan-tz?'s time there were no such men as Liu-hsia Hui? but when a Confucius is Minister of Justice, then, perversely enough, they blaze out again. The power of selecting a noble steed rests with a Po Lo, that it rises to the height of its possibilities depends on a Tsao Fu. Let a Tsao Fu take the reins and sorry jade or fine horse, all can be given the freedom of the roads. In the age of a Chou Kung all scholars, be they worthy or incapable, will be admitted to take part in the discussion on the best form of government. It is the best among drivers who will be found expert in teamstering horses, and the worthiest among the ministers who will be found expert in making use of the scholars. Now-a-days they select men of unusual ability but let benighted lackeys drive them. It is like yoking a noble steed to a salt-wain and belaboring it, demanding speed. This demonstrates well enough how worthies and Literati are found to be mostly unworthy for recommendation. (e) The Lord Grand Secretary: Faugh! You are, my doctors, ne'er-do-wells10 10 t'o n'i. Cf. Discourses, p. 117, "Low, mean, base." The K'ang Hsi Tz? Tien quotes the YTL in explanation of this term. devoid of principle, never 198 practicing what you preach, the spirit of the letter in you never second each other. A plague since days of old have you been, like the wall-piercing burglars!11 11 Cf. Lun Yü, XVII, 12. Rightly indeed was Confucius booted out by the Prince of Lu, and found of no use by his age! How so? Well, they were always malaprop with their doltish reactions to their age, too much preoccupied with the flock of budding ideas in their skulls. It fell to the king of Ch'in to do away by fire with their lore instead of practicing it, and burying their kind in Wei Chung instead of finding employment for them. Ha! he gave them, indeed, no opportunity to set their tongues adrumming in their mouths and to arch their eyebrows premeditating their pro and contra disquisitions on affairs of national scope.12 12 All this paragraph is joined to the next chapter in Chang Chih-hsiang's edition. Chapter XXVIII. ON NATIONAL ILLS. (a) The Literati: No fault it is of the scholars that the worthiest among them find no employment in this state, but rather a shame to the authorities. A great sage was Confucius, but none of the feudal lords saw fit to use him. When, however, he had occupied a comparatively insignificant position in Lu but for three months,1 1 The Shih Lei Fu reads: he needed no orders to have things carried out and no prohibitions to stop malpractices. His beneficial influence was like unto the downpour of the seasonal rain causing the efflorescence of all things. How much more could he have done had he occupied an exalted position at the central court of the Empire and had been able to diffuse abroad the sonance of a sage Emperor's virtue and the balsam of his instructions? But you, Lord High Minister, for more than ten years you have been occupying an eminent position holding the reins of government over the Empire2 2 For the biographical sources relating to Sang Hung-yang, "Lord High Minister," cf. Discourses, chap. XVII, p. 106, note 1. ; yet you never have diffused any achievement or moral excellence over the world, but have been studiously belaboring the people. While the people are impoverished and in dire distress 199 your own family has amassed a fortune estimated by tens of thousands of gold. Of such conduct was the Superior Man ashamed and such ones are criticized in the poem `They are felling the hickories.'3 3 Poem in Shih Ching [Legge, Chi. Classics, Vol. IV, pt. I, Bk. IX, Ode VI, where t`an is translated as "sandal trees," as by Bretschneider. The sandal tree is tropical and hence could not be found in North China. Cf. loc. cit., note, p. 170, also p. 127 where Legge indicates that he does not mean the sandal tree of commerce.] In former days when Shang Yang was Chancellor of Ch'in he relegated etiquette and courtesy to the encouragement of selfishness and greed, honored `head hunting'4 4 Cf. J. J. L. Duyvendak, The Book of Lord Shang. A Classic of the Chinese School of Law (London, 1928). See also Discourses, chap. VII and footnotes passim. [by his soldiers] and concentrated on conquest and aggression. He made no effort to propagate virtue among the people, but imposed severe laws and statutes on the country so that morals become more corrupt daily and the people increasingly complained. So King Hui was forced to boil and embrine his body in order to placate the Empire. At that time he also had no opportunity left to make his disquisitions on national affairs. Now you, our present authorities, resent the fact that the Confucianists, poor and insignificant, talk too much, but we5 5 . . . . . . Chang's ed. inserts the character between and . also have our worries occasioned by the many annoyances you create with your wealth and undue pre-eminence. Woefully6 6 Cf. the Erh Ya for the extensive use of binoms in the text here. Here again the author utilizes a particular work (? Erh Ya) in compiling this chapter. the Lord Grand Secretary looked at the Literati and said nothing. (b) The Cancellarius7 7 Mr. Chun-Ming Chang, in CSPSR, XVIII, I, p. 5, has his own excellent translation of this passage. He makes the Yü Shih Ta-fu the "Grand Censor" rather than "Lord Grand Secretary" as in Discourses, though it is doubtful if the Censorate had yet been established. : Now, now! Why can you not in discussing the administrative affairs of the nation and in discoursing on the policy of the authorities, expostulate with reason point by point, why wax vehement to such an extent? The Lord Grand Secretary considers it difficult to abolish the salt and iron monopoly not for the sake of his private fortune but out of consideration for the national expenditure and the needs of the 200 borderland. You also, Doctors, in contending reprovingly against these state monopolies, are not working for yourselves, but in earnest wish to return to the practices of old and to entrench firmly altruism and justice. Both sides to this debate have their preferences but as circumstances change with the changing time, how could it be possible to stick fast to the ancient methods and deny the validity of modern ways? Furthermore, according to the Hsiao Ya, in criticising others, one must offer something constructive in exchange. If you, doctors, could devise however, means to give peace to the country or to subdue the distant lands, so that there would be no calamity from raids and attacks at the frontier then all the dues and taxes would be abolished for your sake, to say nothing of the salt and iron monopoly and the equable marketing system. According to your most esteemed precepts, a Confucian should treasure a retiring and complaisant disposition and treat all people in the proper way. Now in your vigorous debates and accusations, you have shown not the eloquence of Ch'ih and Ts'ê but demonstrated only your crude and violent manners, unheard of here. If the Lord Grand Secretary has gone too far, you doctors have also done so. It is only just that you should apologize to the Lord Grand Secretary. (c) The Worthies and the Literati all arose from their mats and said: Benighted provincials that we are, who have seldom crossed the precincts of this great court, we realize that our wild and uncouth speeches may indeed find no favor here even unto offending the authorities. Yet, so it seems to us, as a medicinal tonic though bitter to the palate still is of great benefit to the patient, so words of loyalty, though offensive to the ear may also be found beneficial to mend one's morals. A great blessing is to be able to hear straightforward denial, it cheapens one to hear nothing but adulatory praise. As swift winds are raging through the forest so flattering words encompass the rich and powerful. After hearing daily at this court controlling myriads of li of territory nothing but servile aye-aye's you hear now the straightforward nay-nay's of honest scholars. `Tis indeed a great opportunity for you, Lord High Minister, to receive a well-needed physic and the benefit of stone and needle.8 8 The surgical simile is developed previously in Discourses, chap. XIV, esp. p. 88. 201 (d) The Lord Grand Secretary's countenance relaxed and with relief he turned his back9 9 should be inserted between and mien should be taken in the unusual sense of "to turn the back on." Wang Hsien-ch'ien discusses the term at length in his note. Mr. Chun-Ming Chang translates "the Grand Censor's face broadened a little and looked at the Literati with uneasiness." to the Literati and said addressing the Worthies: Difficult indeed it is to debate with men who, having seen little, offer arguments as devious as the crooked lanes in which they live. These Literati maintain a death grip upon vaporous talk; there is no hope they will ever change their views. We have already examined the precepts which held good for antiquity, but in viewing the problems of the modern world, we must rely on what our eyes have seen and what our ears have heard. With the changing generations, situations change. At the time of Emperors Wên and Ching and at the beginning of the Chien Yüan period, the people were simple and all followed the fundamental occupation [agriculture], while the officers were honest and self-esteeming. With abundance and superfluity everywhere, the population swelled and families became rich. Now, without any change in the administration or in education, why is it that society is becoming increasingly frivolous and morals are on the decline? The officers have little sense of honesty, the people, little sense of shame. In spite of the punishments imposed on the wicked, evil-doings do not cease. As it is currently said, the provincial Confucianists are inferior to the metropolitan scholars. The Literati, all coming from Shantung, seldom participate in important discussions. You, my lords, have been at the capital long enough to desire that administrative problems be intelligently analyzed and the pro and con intelligently discussed. It is but natural. (e) The Worthies: The navel of the world is Shantung, the battlegound of distinguished scholars! When Emperor Kao [Tsu] took his dragon flight and soared up like a phoenix betwixt Sung and Ch'u, who but the youth of Shantung, men like Hsiao, Ts'o, Fan, Li, Têng and Kuan came to his assistance? Though it was indeed an age different from antiquity yet in it were found men that could be compared with none but Hung Yao and T'ai T'ien. From among the western Ch'iang came Yü, Wên was born among the I of the North, but in sagely virtue they towered above the world; in ability equal to a myriad men, they took upon their shoulders responsibilities 202 no mortal could support. There are men, on the other hand, who come and go through the metropolis' teeming squares no one knows how many times every morn, yet finish their days as nothing more than stable boys. We humbly grant that not being born or raised in the capital, shaggy in talent and scant of wit, we are not qualified to discuss affairs of great importance, but we would like yet to report the tales told by the elders of our village communities. It is not so long ago, it seems, that the common people were clad in warm and comfortable clothes with no ostentatiousness and were perfectly satisfied in making use of crude and simple materials and instruments. These clothes sufficed to cover their bodies; these implements, to facilitate their work. A nag sufficed to serve their steps, a wagon to transport them. They had enough wine to make their meetings merry, but none for dissipation; sufficient music to set their hearts aright, but none for revelry. One heard of no wild banquetting in the home, of no pleasure-seeking excursions abroad. The itinerant went with their packs and bales; the sedentary hoed and weeded. Sparing in their needs, they abounded in wealth, cultivating the fundamental, the people were prosperous. Paying the last honors to their dead, they were sorrowful, never with pomp; in nourishing their living, meet, never extravagant. High officials were upright and not extortionate, those in authority tolerant, never harsh, so that the black-haired people found peace within themselves and all the officers security in their positions. Such was the state of affairs at the beginning of the Chien Yüan era when culture was exalted, moral excellence cultivated and the Empire was enjoying a well earned peace. Then, evil ministers one after another set their wily arts to work at the destruction of perfect government, monopolizing mountains and seas abroad and promoting various profiteering schemes at the court. Yang K'o [-shêng] instituted the `Income Reports,' Chiang Ch'ung regulated dress, the ta-fu Chang amended laws, and Tu Chou took charge of prisons. There were rigidly enforced regulations concerning penalties and redemptions drawn in minute detail and in incalculable numbers. The gangs of Hsia Lan carried out arbitrary arrests and Wan Wên-shu's posses, summary executions. Murderous officers-of-the-law sprang up in great number to the utter dismay and confusion of honest people. At that time no one among the populace felt his head secure on his 203 neck and even among the rich and influential none could guarantee the safety of his family. Then the sage Emperor awakened to the realization of what was going on! Thereupon Ch'iang and his crowd suffered the extreme penalty and the murderous brigands were executed in order to pare off the resentment of those condemned to death and stop the odium of the Empire. Since then, everywhere among the settled people peace has been restored, yet the damage that had been done would take several generations to be repaired and the wounds and sores of the nations are not yet healed to the present day. Thus, there are still officials who practice the same methods of the murderous brigands and powerful stewards with hearts of revenous despoilers. High ministers, having exclusive control of great power, smash and break as they see fit, strong rascals form cliques and abuse everyone, the rich and prominent indulge in luxury and extravagance while the poor and humble take to rapine and murder. Women's handiwork, so hard in making, is easily destroyed, carts and utensils, so difficult to complete, are easily broken. A cart lasts less than two years, implements are broken before the expiration of a twelvemonth. But a cart costs one thousand weights of grain, a suit of clothes, ten bushels. The common people use fancy goblets, painted tables, tabourets and mats, and well seamed and doubled garments. The serving wenches sport colored silk dresses and satin sandals, the plebeian has hulled rice and meat on his fare. Fashions in every village, factions in every association, spirited races on country highways and football games in beggars' alleys. Too few are those who grasp the plough and clutch the shuttle and personally engage in farming and weaving and too numerous those who squeeze their waists and studiously paint their faces with white powder and black pencil. Paupers play the part of opulence and the destitute boast extravagantly, with gay coats without lining, silk breeches over hempcloth underwear, elaborate funeral cortèges for the dead, while the living are not properly fed, patrimonies are wasted to provide sumptuous funerals, dowries by the cartloads for marrying daughters. The rich strive to surpass one another, the poor, to catch up with the rich, the former depleting their substance, the latter weighing (borrowed) goods. This is why the people become desperate and the need increases year by year. Poor, they have little shame; 204 destitute, they have scarcely any honesty: this is the explanation to corruption not diminishing in spite of the punishment of wrong doers and the execution of the wicked. Thus it is that these manifestations of terrific nervousness in the country produce the ills of insufficiency [described] before.10 10 The foregoing paragraphs are of notable value as graphically describing in few words society in the early Han Empire.</field>
