SUMMER QUARTER OF THE ANNOUNCEMENTS THE SUMMER QUARTER. The Summer Quarter of the University is an integral part of the University Year, the Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences being the same in character method and in credit value as in the other quarters. In the Department of Education many professional courses for elementary and high school teachers which are not offered in the regular session are given to meet certificate requirements. The Summer Quarter is divided into two terms for the accommodation of those who can give only six weeks to the work but who desire University credit. The First Term will begin June 19th, and will close July 29th, with lectures five times a week. The Second Term will begin July 31st, and will close September 2nd, with six lectures a week. Students may enter for either term or both. A separate registration card must be filled out for each Term. The normal amount of work for college credit which a student may take, is three courses; but in a few exceptional cases, by special permission of the Dean and the approval of the instructors in all the courses taken, permission may be obtained to take four courses. In all cases an additional fee of $5.00 will be charged for each extra course. See page 12. The University of Virginia Summer Quarter is conducted for teachers and students in high schools, academies and colleges and for those who desire professional training for primary and grammar grade work, and for college students. It takes as its peculiar province, not the ordinary summer institute, but the solid and substantial training of high school teachers, college teachers, college students, and teachers of any grade who wish to procure professional work. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS.âThere are no formal examinations for admission to the Summer Quarter. Students, both men and women, will be admitted to such courses as the respective instructors find them qualified to pursue with advantage, but they should be graduates of accredited high schools or have had equivalent preparation. If a student wishes regular admission with a view to taking a degree, and does not expect to register in the regular session of the University, he should present a full statement with, as far as possible, official credentials of all work which he has done in high school or college. These credentials should be sent in advance to the Dean of the Summer Quarter. Suitable blank forms will be furnished upon request. LOCATION.âCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. The average monthly mean temperature from 1901 to 1911, taken from the records of the weather station at the University Observatory, was: June, 71.4; July, 76.8. There are golf links, swimming pools and many other attractions for summer visitors. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA EXCURSIONS.âUnder the directorship of a competent guide, there will be excursions to neighboring points of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Caverns; the Grottoes of the Shenandoah; the battle fields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond and Old Point Comfort (three hours' ride to each) should make a visit exceptionally interesting. On designated clear nights parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick Astronomical Observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the Observatory. ENTERTAINMENTS, AND LECTURES.âA Musical Festival and other entertainments will be announced during the session of the Summer Quarter. The whole course includes about twenty numbers and the price of a season ticket is low, making the cost about the same as moving pictures. Among the attractions already engaged are: The Devereux Dramatic Company, June 26 and 27; Magic, by G. K. Chesteron; Rosmersholm, by Henrik Ibsen; and the Mummy's Ear Ring, adapted from Echegaray. Frank McEntee, Director the Shakespeare Play House, July 17, 18, 19, and 20âCandida, Bernard Shaw; Man and Superman, Shaw; A Doll's House, Ibsen; The Pidgeon, Galsworthy; Irish Playsâ Night at an Inn, Riders of the Sea, Rising of the Moon, and In the Shadow of the Glen; and one Shakespeare play or most probably Mr. Pim or Peg O' My Heart. Mr. and Mrs. Michitaro Ongawa, Japanese Actors and Musicians, June 30, in a program consisting of Japanese Music and a playâ"The Fox Woman"âa story of Witchcraft. Samuel GardnerâViolin Concert. Several other musical numbers by distinguished artists. BOARD AND ROOMS.âBoard and room may be had at prices ranging from $7.00 per week, where several stay in the same room, upward, according to accommodation and proximity to the University, the average being $7.50 to $9.00 per week. Most of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. Two hundred and twenty-five furnished double rooms in the University dormitories will be reserved in the order of application. The price for each term will be $10.00 for the full term of six weeks for a double room. All checks for rooms should be made payable to E. I. Carruthers, Bursar. Every double room must be occupied by two persons. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied with the full amount of the fee, which will be returned for good reason and room released if application is made before June 10th. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer Quarter. Rooms that are reserved will not be held later than July 1st. No room will be open for occupancy before June 17th. Roomers must provide themselves with necessary bed clothes, towels, etc. Rooms will be in charge of Mrs. E. I. Carruthers, an experienced matron and chaperon. Some members of the faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. No cooking allowed in rooms. Several houses on Dawson's Row will be reserved for men. The location of these dormitories in the University grounds and the social advantages resulting from bringing so many teachers close together make this arrangement a very desirable one and the rooms are eagerly sought. Application for dormitory rooms should be sent promptly with retaining fee. For list of boarding houses, rates, etc., see page 62, or write to Secretary Summer Quarter, Box 149, University, Virginia. SUMMER QUARTER OF THE THE BARRACKS CLUB. In order to provide additional rooming facilities at the very lowest cost to the students, a large, frame two-story barracks building has been erected on the grounds, conveniently located to the lecture halls and cafeteria. The building comprises four large, well-lighted sleeping rooms, equipped with 20 single iron beds with good all-cotton mattresses in each room. Built-in clothes closets and all-steel lockers are provided for each occupant. The house contains two large study rooms equipped with tables and chairs. Electric light and janitor service are provided. The discipline and conduct of the building are in charge of a committee of the occupants who will see that order is maintained. A matron will have general charge. Accommodation may be had in the Club for $5.00 for the term of six weeks. APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF NECESSARY EXPENSES. The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of six weeks. As necessary expenses are reckoned here university and tuition fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. Three estimates are givenâa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundryâin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the estimate. Virginia Teachers. Non-Virginians.* * College students and other Virginians who are not teaching are charged the same tuition fees as non-Virginians. Low Average Liberal Low Average Liberal University Fee $ 1.50 $ 1.50 $ 1.50 $ â $ â $ â Tuition Fee 15.00 15.00 15.00 Medical Fee .50 .50 .50 .50 .50 .50 RoomâLight, Furniture and Service 5.00 12.00 18.00 5.00 12.00 18.00 Board 22.50 36.00 48.00 22.50 36.00 48.00 Books 2.50 2.50 5.00 2.50 2.50 5.00 Laundry 5.00 5.00 7.50 5.00 5.00 7.50 Total for session of six weeks $37.00 $57.50 $80.50 $50.50 $71.00 $94.00 UNIVERSITY CAFETERIA.âThe University Cafeteria, conducted by Mrs. Josie W. Rodes, will be open for summer students and will provide table board at very low prices. The average cost last session for three meals per day, including all transient meals served, was $22.40 per month. It should be somewhat lower this year. It is not necessary to reserve a place in the Cafeteria in advance. FEES FOR VIRGINIA TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.âTuition is entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses, leading to certification. No student, however, will be permitted to take more than three advanced courses without the payment of $5.00 for each additional course. To meet local expenses the State Board of Education has fixed a registration fee of $1.50 for a six weeks' term for all of the Summer Schools of the State, and this fee will be UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA charged here. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands, for which fees will be charged to all who take them. The fee for each is designated in the catalogue. Small fees in laboratory courses will also be charged all students who register in them. Students from Virginia who are not teachers or definitely preparing to teach next session will be charged the same tuition as non-Virginia students. Teachers whose residence is in Virginia but who are teaching outside of Virginia will be charged the same fee as non-Virginians. FEES FOR NON-VIRGINIA STUDENTS.âA single registration fee of fifteen dollars for each term will be charged each student who registers from outside of Virginia. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue (except a few special courses which are so designated). No student, however, will be permitted to take more than three courses without special permission in writing from all instructors concerned and the Dean and without paying a fee of $5.00 for each extra course. See page 15. Note.âTeachers outside of Virginia are not limited in the choice of their courses to the regulations under which Virginia certificates are issued, unless they desire to teach in Virginia and apply for a license issued in this State. In this case only State certificates from other states issued by a State Superintendent or a State Board of Examiners, and approved in advance by the Department of Public Instruction of Virginia, will be recognized as a proper basis for professional credit. Teachers from other states will receive credit for all work done in accordance with the certificate regulations of those States from which they come. Most Southern States accept the work of the University Summer Quarter for certificate credit or renewal. Medical Fee.âA small medical fee of 50 cents will be charged each person who registers each term, which will entitle him or her to free medical attendance by Dr. W. E. Bray, the Physician of the Summer Quarter, hospital phone, 548; residence phone, 565; office hours at the hospital 11:30 to 12:30 and 4:30 to 5:00. Greatly reduced charges, if it should be necessary, will be given at the University Hospital, under the following regulations: Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the Physician of the Summer Quarter; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, and for special treatment of the eye, ear, nose, and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of the students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the Summer Quarter Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. TIME AND PLACE OF RECITATIONS AND LECTURES.â Recitations will begin in all courses Tuesday, June 20th, at 8:30 a. m. There will be no classes on Saturdays in the first term except June 24th, and July 8th, when classes will meet at the usual hours, to make up for registration and examination days. The length of recitation periods will be one hour, ten minutes of which will be allowed for transfer from one room to another. SUMMER QUARTER OF THE SUNDAY VESPER SERVICES.âExperience has shown that no Sunday service held here during the summer has been more attractive or more appreciated than the Vesper Service. Holding this service at this hour enables all the faculty and the students of the summer school to unite in one common service without at all interfering with their attending the churches of their choice in the city. The service, which is always kept within one hour, begins at seven o'clock, and when weather permits, is held in the McIntire Ampitheatre. Otherwise in Cabell Hall. REGISTRATION.âMonday, June 19th, will be devoted to the registration of students. All students who can possibly do so should register on this day. Those who fail to register before June 20th, will be permitted to attend classes, and register as promptly as possible at other hours. The Registrar's office, located in Peabody Hall, will be open continuously from 8:30 a. m. to 5:00 p. m. Students should consult freely with members of the Faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Tuesday, June 26th, except a certificate of attendance. No student will be enrolled in any course without a registration card naming the course in question and properly signed by the Registrar and the Bursar. THE GENERAL LIBRARY.âThe General Library is open to the corps of instructors and the students of the Summer Quarter, from 9 a. m. to 1:30 p. m.; 3 to 5, and from 7:30 to 10 p. m. The collection contains about seventy thousand volumes. All books withdrawn from the library must be charged at the desk. Usually books are lent for one week but there are exceptions, and the loan expires on the date stamped in the book. Prompt return not later than the date on which the loan expires is expected and borrowers will be fined ten cents for each day delinquent. Students are expected to give prompt attention to all communications from the librarian. REST AND STUDY ROOMS.âMadison Hall, the beautiful building of the Young Men's Christian Association, and during the summer session headquarters for the Y. W. C. A., will be open to students and Faculty of the Summer Quarter, from nine o'clock in the morning until ten at night. Students will have access to the current periodicals in the reading room. The other rooms will be used for rest, for study, for recreation, and for social gatherings. North of the building there are nineteen tennis courts which will be equipped for the use of the students. THE YOUNG WOMEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. The program of the Y. W. C. A. in a summer school is most elastic for its great aim is to fit into an already packed six weeks of work by serving wherever it is most needed. Whether the demands are for recreationâparties, games, tournaments, hikes, etc.,âor for opportunities for spiritual growthâby Bible classes or meetingsâthe Y. W. C. A. strives to meet the needs. Sometimes the requests of the student for spiritual growth calls into existence Bible classes where, under strong leadership, the principles of religion and life are discussed. Sometimes, a desire or corporate worship is expressed, and the vesper service meets the need. The Y. W. C. A. Secretary is on the campus to look after the "activities" of the Association, but better still, she is there as a friend for UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA every student. The Y. W. C. A. building (Madison Hall) is of value only as it is of serviceâwhether through its reading room, as a social center, or as an information bureau. The desire of the Y. W. C. A. is that every woman in attendance during the Summer Quarter may find something she needs or wants from the Y. W. C. A. The Secretary in charge will be Miss Elsie B. Heller, Student Secretary of the South Atlantic Field Committee of the Y. W. C. A. She and her assistant request the co-operation of all and invite each student to make the Y. W. C. A. her "home" while at the University. STUDENTS' MAIL.âIn order to insure safe and prompt delivery of mail, every student should have all mail directed to, University, Virginia, giving always the street and number of his or her boarding place or the number and location of his or her room in the University. The local address should be filed at the post office promptly upon arrival. TEACHERS' POSITIONS.âThe University Appointment Committee receives demands for teachers each year. This committee is glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer Quarter file their applications. There is no charge for this service. THE SUMMER SCHOOL NEWS.âThe News is a college newspaper, edited and managed by students of the Summer Quarter. It contains all official and student organization announcements, campus news and notes, editorial comment, etc. Its object is to acquaint individuals with the life of the whole student body, and to unify the interests of all. REGULATIONS CONCERNING CREDIT.âThe instructor giving each course will keep the class grades and attendance, hold the examination and average the class grade with the examination grade, returning to the Dean of the Summer Quarter the general average grade of each student in each course. Absences or delayed entrance will be counted against the student. All examinations must be held under the Honor System. A certificate for each course completed with an average grade of 75 per cent will be signed by the instructor and the Dean of the Summer Quarter and mailed to the student. Each student who wishes certificates sent, should file with the registrar not later than July 20th, a large, self-addressed stamped envelope for mailing them. Credit Allowed by Other States than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia State Board of Education. Credit is now allowed toward the extension of certificates by many Southern States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Dean of the Summer Quarter. Entrance Credit.âWhere courses in the Summer Quarter are taken to absolve conditions or to meet entrance requirements, no more than three units of entrance credit may be obtained in a full quarter. University of Virginia College Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer Quarter. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer Quarter. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of the courses in the summer quarter in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subject, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent SUMMER QUARTER OF THE to those required for entrance to the University of Virginia, and provided, that the certificates of courses completed be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned. (c) The Dean of the College will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding courses in the University. All courses numbered from 1 to 100 in this catalogue have been approved by the professors concerned and will be accepted by the Dean for such credit as is indicated in the description of each course. (d) Students both men and women who satisfy entrance requirements will not only receive credit at the University of Virginia for college courses taken in the Summer Quarter, but the summer work is recognized by standard colleges everywhere, so that students have no difficulty in securing transfer of credits. (e) That graduate courses completed in the Summer Quarter, if approved by the Committee of Graduate Studies, shall be credited just as if they were taken in the regular session; that residence work aggregating three summer quarters shall be considered as fulfilling the residence requirements for the master's degree. The following courses offered this Quarter will be given M. A. credit: Biology 7C, Biology 8C, Chemistry 10C, Economics 76C, Economics 77C, Economics 78C, Economics 83C, Education 13C, Education 14C, Education 17C, Education 18C, Education 20C, Education 23C, Education 28C, French 59C, French 60C, French 61C, Government 86C, Government 87C, Government 88C, Latin 48C, Mathematics 64C, Spanish 59C, Spanish 60C, Spanish 61C, English 29C, English 30C, English 35C, English 37C, English 38C, English 39C. College Credit.âCandidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college must specify the character of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades. The final validation of such certificates is effected by the successful completion of the courses taken in this university. In no case will credit be given on more than forty-eight session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining fifteen session-hours required or his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the Summer Quarter. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full summer quarters in this University. REGULATIONS. The Session-Hour.âAll courses are measured in terms of the session-hour as a unit. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the regular session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work, or five hours a week or five laboratory periods a week for a term of six weeks in the Summer Quarter. Maximum and Minimum Number of Session-Hours.âEach student may undertake each term courses aggregating three session-hours (with the exception noted in paragraph I). (I) A student may take four session-hours, provided he (a) has passed in the regular session at the college last attended courses aggregating fifteen session-hours, or (b) is in his graduating year and needs four session-hours for his degree. Exceptions to the above regulations will be allowed only by special UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA permission of the Dean of the Summer Quarter and all of the professors concerned. Physical training is not counted in the maximum and minimum requirements detailed above. Grade.âThe grade of a student in any course is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. For passing in any course a grade of seventy-five per cent is required. Absence from Lectures may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like providential cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made on the day of the first lecture attended after the absence. Absence from Examinations will not be excused, except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as to a total failure. Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, in accordance with above, is entitled to a special examination on a date to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge of the examination. DEGREES. Students who desire to confer with representatives of the Faculties in regard to their program of work leading to a degree can do so at the following office hours: Charles G. Maphis, Dean of the Summer Quarter, 11:30-12:30â Peabody Hall. James Morris Page, Dean of the University, 10:30-11:30âAdminis-tration Building.

Appropriate courses taken in the summer quarter count toward these degrees. No course offered by a successful candidate for one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees can be offered by the same candidate as part of the work credited toward the other cultural baccalaureate degree, nor can any work done to remove an entrance condition be counted for any degree. The Summer Quarter is an integral part of the University year. Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences as well as the Department of Education, are the same in character and in credit value as in any other quarter of the University. Degrees are conferred upon men SUMMER QUARTER OF THE and women upon exactly the same terms for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. Sixty-three session-hours of undergraudate courses, taken in conformity with the requirements published herewith, are required for the Bachelor's degree. Those who contemplate completing their degree reqiurements in the Summer Quarter should keep clearly in mind, in estimating the time that will be required, that the normal amount of credit which may be taken in one Summer Quarter is six session-hours. Candidates for a degree who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. This certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean of the Summer Quarter and to the Dean of the Department in which the degree will be obtained.

Admission to the Department.âFor admission to the Department of Graduate Studies a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank is required, for men and women alike. In order to become a candidate for a degree, the student must be advanced to candidacy by the Committee on Rules and Courses upon formal application as set forth below. Advancement to Candidacy for a Degree.âAny graduate student who wishes to become a candidate for a degree must file with the Dean of the Department his application on a blank form to be secured from the Registrar. This application must include a proposed program of work arranged in accordance with the requirements for the several degrees as stated below, and must be accompanied, in case the applicant does not hold an academic degree from the University, by an official transcript of the applicant's academic record made out by the Registrar of the institution from which the baccalaureate degree was received, and by a catalogue of that institution, marked to show the courses of study pursued. The application will be submitted by the Dean to the Committee on Rules and Courses, who will UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA consider it in conference with the professors concerned. The Committee will have the right to require that the applicant add to his program any courses, undergraduate or graduate, considered necessary to supply his deficiencies, or to enable him to pursue with profit the courses he has selected. When the program has been finally approved, the Dean will report to the applicant his advancement to candidacy for a degree. It should be distinctly understood that graduate degrees are not conferred merely upon the basis of the unmber of courses passed, or of the length of time spent in resident or non-resident work, but upon the basis of the quality and scope of the candidate's knowledge and his power of investigation in his chosen field of study. Candidates whose training and attainments are inferior cannot expect to secure a degree in the normal length of time estimated below for the respective degrees. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. Master of Arts.âThe degree of Master of Arts will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Arts who has fulfilled the following requirements: (1) The successful completion, in not less than one full year of resident graduate work, or three summer quarters, of the program of studies approved for the candidate by the Committee on Rules and Courses, as embodied in his formal application for advancement to candidacy.

SUMMER QUARTER OF THE COURSES IN PORTO RICO The Summer Quarter of the University of Virginia in co-operation with the University of Porto Rico, located at Rio Piedras, a short distance from San Juan, offers a series of courses in the Spanish language and literature, to be given during six weeks (June and July) in the summer of 1922. The courses offered in Porto Rico will correspond as nearly as possible with the courses offered in the Summer Quarter of the University of Virginia in 1922, and will be given equivalent credit by the University of Porto Rico. These credits will be accepted with full value by the University of Virginia. The party will be conducted by Dr. James C. Bardin, Associate Professor of Romanic Languages of the University of Virginia, and Miss J. W. Holt, Instructor in Spanish in the Summer Quarter of the University of Virginia. The cost of the trip including steamer fare from New York to San Juan and return, board and lodging for six weeks in Porto Rico, and instruction in the courses offeredâwill be $300. For detailed information, write direct to Dr. James C. Bardin, Box 80, University, Va. Reservations should be applied for as soon as possible, as the number to be taken must be limited. LA CASA ESPANOLA One of the Fraternity Houses at the University will be placed at the disposal of the students of Spanish for the Summer Quarter. Both men and women who have had as a minimum, one Summer Session of work in Spanish will be admitted to the afternoon conferences, the weekly receptions and every advantage that the house can afford to non-residents. Miss â will live in the house and preside at the afternoon conferences. Books, magazines and newspapers from Spanish and Latin-American countries will be provided and every facility will be afforded to give the student a first hand knowledge of the Spanish language, literature and civilization. Additional opportunity of hearing the language spoken by people from several Latin-American countries will be constantly furnished. It is the wish of the University to make the Casa Espanola especially serviceable to students who may wish to teach Spanish and upon payment of a nominal fee any one may reserve for meal time a place at a table where Spanish only will be spoken. A modern Spanish drama with Spanish songs and music will be given during the first term of the Summer Quarter by the members of the Spanish classes. As the number of students who can be accommodated in the house is limited, it will be well to make application as early as possible. Members of the Casa Espanola furnish their own towels and bed linen. Single room per term, including all privileges, $22.50. Double room per term, including all privileges, $17.50 each person. Board $8.00 per week. For non-residents per term, $9.00. A house fee of $1.00 per week payable in advance to the Director will be charged. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA WRITING Writing 113a.
