      <field name="fulltext">CATALOGUE OF THE STATEMENT OF THE TERMS OF ADMISSION, COURSES OF INSTRUCTION, EXPENSES, &amp;c. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. MATRICULATION. To be admitted as a student of the University, the applicant must be at least sixteen years of age; but the Faculty may dispense with this requirement in favor of one who has a brother, of the requisite age, entering at the same time. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he must produce a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence of general good conduct. There is no prescribed course of studies in this institution. Every student may select the schools he will attend; but, in the academic department, he is required to attend at least three, unless, upon the written request of his parent or guardian, or for good cause shown, the Faculty shall allow him to attend less than three. Students are permitted to exchange schools, with transfer of fees, within one week after admission; thereafter no exchange is allowed, except by leave of the Faculty, and then without transfer of fees. The session commences on the first of October, and continues, without interruption, until the Thursday before the fourth day of July. The mode of instruction is by lectures and text-books, accompanied by daily examinations. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. Literary Department. I.âSCHOOL OF LATIN. PROF. PETERS.

Stewart's Active and Moral Powers. 7. Alexander's Moral Science. 8. Butler's Analogy and Sermons. The above books are used in the order named. Three lectures each week are given. V.âSCHOOL OF HISTORY, GENERAL LITERATURE AND RHETORIC. PROF. HOLMES. This School is divided into two distinct classesâone of History, and one of Literature and Rhetoric. To each, two Lectures in the week are regularly devoted; but exercises in literary composition are required from the members of the Literary Class. Each study may be pursued separately. In the Historical Class the successions, revolutions and various aspects of the principal nations of the world are considered in such a manner as to afford a general and connected view of the progress of political and social organizations. Institutions and laws are noted as the manifestations of different phases of society; an attempt is made to discover and elucidate the conditions of historical advancement, and to refer the changes of nations and governments to the operation of regular principles. In the absence of appropriate Text-Books, the following are employed for study and reference: Schmitz's Manual of Ancient History; Smith's History of Greece; Gibbon, Abridged by Smith; Taylor's Manual of Modern History. For reference: Long's Ancient Atlas; Appleton's (College) Atlas, or Chambers' Atlas; Blair's Chronology (Bohn's edition). In the Class of Literature and Rhetoric, the English Language, English Composition, Rhetoric and the English Classics, with the History of English Literature, are studied. The origin, growth and philological peculiarities of the Language will be considered; the various influences, domestic and external, by which it has been brought to its present condition, will be explained; the general principles of Rhetoric and Criticism will be taught; the lives of the most eminent authors in the language will be treated in their historical order and connection; and the critical examination and appreciation of their chief productions will occupy much of the time of the student. The class will also be required to practice Literary Composition. Text-Books in this department are very deficient. The following will be used for the present: Angus's Hand Book of the English Tongue; Jamieson's Grammar of Rhetoric; Shaw's Complete Manual of English Literature, Ed. Smith and Tuckerman; Student's Specimens of English Literature, Ed. Shaw and Smith, London: Shakspeare's Complete Works; Milton's Poetical Works. POLITICAL ECONOMY. In the Class of Political Economy, temporarily connected with this School, the Text-Books, heretofore and still used, are Say's Political Economy, Mill's (J. S.) Political Economy. Two lectures a week are given. Scientific Department. VI.âSCHOOL OF MATHEMATICS. PROF. VENABLE. This School embraces two distinct departments or courses: 1. Pure Mathematics. 2. Mixed Mathematics. I. Pure Mathematics.âIn the course of Pure Mathematics there are three classes, Junior, Intermediate, and Senior. In the Junior Class are studied the Theory of Arithmetical Operations and Notation, Algebra, Geometry and Geometrical Conic Sections, with discussions of the Ancient Geometrical Analysis, the Theory of Transversals, and other subjects of Modern Geometry. The preparation desirable for this class is the thorough study of Arithmetic, of Algebra through Equations of the Second Degree, and of the first four books of Legendre or Euclid. In the Intermediate Class the studies are Plane and Spherical Trigonometry with Applications, Analytical Geometry of two Dimensions, the Theory of Equations and Elements of Descriptive Geometry. In the Senior Class the subjects of study are Analytical Geometry of three Dimensions, the Differential and Integral Calculus with applications to the Theory of Probabilities, and the Determination of Mean Values and Centres of Gravity, and the Calculus of Variations. Lectures are given to this class on the History of Mathematics, and on some points in Controversial Mathematics, with brief discussions of the elements of Trilinear CoÃ¶rdinates, of the Theory of Determinants, the Theory of Complex Fractions, and of the principles of the Method of Quaternions. Text-Books in Pure Mathematics: 1. Junior ClassâVenable's Higher Arithmetic, Robinson's University Algebra, Legendre's Geometry. For reference and examples, Todhunter's Algebra, Pott's Euclid, Taylor's Conic Sections. 2. Intermediate ClassâSnowball's Trigonometry, Law's Logarithms, Puckle's Conic Sections (Analytical Geometry), Church's Descriptive Geometry. For reference, Todhunter's Theory of Equations. 3. Senior ClassâAldis' Solid Geometry, Courtenay's Calculus, Todhunter's Differential and Integral Calculus. II. Mixed Mathematics.âThis course is designed for those students who may desire to prosecute their studies beyond the limits of the Pure Mathematics. It embraces Applications of the Differential and Integral Calculus to selected portions of Mechanics, Physics and Physical Astronomy. There is one class in the Mixed Mathematics. The instruction in each class in the School of Mathematics is conveyed partly by lectures and partly by the systematic study of approved text-books, the student being assisted by full and frequent explanations from the Professor, and being constantly subjected to rigid examinations. The progress of the student in each class is also tested by his beig required to perform written exercises, in which the principles acquired are applied to the solution of particular problems. Any student entering the school has the privilege of attending all or any of the classes, and if prepared to enter an advanced class, may often find it highly advantageous to review his previous studies by attendance on a lower class also. In the Junior Class there are three lectures each week; in the Intermediate Class, two lectures each week; in the Senior Class, three lectures each week. In the Class of Mixed Mathematics, three lectures each week. VII.âSCHOOL OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. PROF. SMITH. There are three classes in this School. 1. The Junior or General Class, which meets three times each week throughout the session of nine months. The object of the course of lectures to this class is to furnish the student with a comprehensive view of Modern Physics, and to make him familiar with its methods of investigation. With the design of laying a thoroughly scientific basis for the course, a large space is given at the outset to the discussion of the cardinal doctrines of motion and force. These doctrines are established, and their leading consequences are traced, without the use of mathematical symbols. Guided by these truths, the teacher discusses, in the light of experiment, the structure of matter according to the received atomic hypotheses, and the equilibrium and motion of solids and fluids. These topics, with various applications, occupy the first half of the course of lectures. The remainder of the course is devoted to Molecular Physics, and treats of Capillarity, Osmose, Wave Motion, Sound, Light, Heat and Electricity. In this, as in the previous portion of the lectures, the established laws of motion and force are kept steadily in view, and an attempt is made so to present and discuss the phenomena as to convince the student that the entire body of Physics is a coherent and harmonious system of mechanical truth. Text-Book.âSilliman's Physics. 2. The Senior Class.âThis class meets twice a week, and studies Mechanics and Astronomy. Text-Books.âParkinson's Mechanics, Norton's Astronomy. MINERALOGY AND GEOLOGY. 3. These subjects are assigned to a separate class, which the members of the other classes in the School may attend without payment of an additional fee. In this class the lectures commence with General Mineralogy, which is treated with especial reference to Geology, to which it is designed to be an introduction. In the lectures on Geology, the specific identity of ancient and modern Geological causes is pointed out; the present action of these causes, whether atmospheric, aqueous or igneous, is considered, and their effects in the past history of our planet are examined. The illustrations are drawn, as far as practicable, from the Geological structure of Virginia. The students have an opportunity of familiarizing themselves with the minerals, rocks and fossils exhibited in the lectures. Text-Books.âDana's Manuals of Mineralogy and Geology. VIII.âSCHOOL OF CHEMISTRY. PROF. MAUPIN. The course of lectures in this School commences with such an exposition of the phenomena and laws of Heat, Light and Electricity, as is rendered necessary by their relations to chemical changes and chemical theories. The subject of Chemistry proper, is then taken up and presented in the following order: 1. The history of the Metalloids and their combinations with each other, and, in connection therewith, the exposition of the principles of the Chemical Nomenclature, Symbols and Notation. 2. The general principles of Chemical Philosophyâincluding the 5 Laws of Combination, the Atomic Theory and Theory of Volumes, Simple and Current Affinity, &amp;c. 3. The Metalsâtheir combinations with the Metalloids, and their saline combinations. 4. Organic Chemistryâincluding the general principles of Organic Analysis, and the detailed consideration of the series of Hydrocarbons, Alcohols, Ethers, Organic Acids and Bases, &amp;c. The processes for detecting Poisons, and the means of counteracting their effects, are presented in their proper connections; and throughout the course the applications of the facts and principles of Chemistry to Medicine, Agriculture and the Arts are duly noticed. The whole subject is presented in the lights of the modern Theories of the science, which have recently gained so strong a foothold throughout the Chemical worldâthe object being to place the student in a position not only to enter, understandingly, upon any of the practical applications of the science to which his attention may be turned, but to keep pace with its development and progress. Text-Book.âFownes' Chemistry, last edition. IX.âSCHOOL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS, ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE. PROF. BÅCK. The School is divided into three classes. 1. Junior ClassâTheory and use of Engineering Instruments,* * The subjects marked by the asterisk are those required for the students of Mining Engineering in this school. (See Degrees, page 45.)

For the use of students in this school a commodious Drawing Hall has been fitted up, and ample collections of Field Instruments and Models, illustrating the principles of Hydraulic, Architectural and Mechanical Engineering, have been provided. These models of admirable workmanship were constructed for the University in the widely known establishment of SchrÃ¶der, of Darmstadt, Germany. X. SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL, AGRICULTURAL AND INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY. PROF. MALLET. This School having been created with a view to the growing demand for scientific knowledge in its applications to the useful arts and to the development of the natural resources of the country, the endeavor is made to render the teachings of the Chair as practical as possible, while basing them upon sound principles of general scienceâthus presenting the opportunity of preparation for such positions as those of the miner and metallurgist, the chemical manufacturer, the farmer, the dyer, bleacher, tanner, analytical chemist, &amp;c. The system of instruction consists of a course of Lectures upon Technical Chemistry, and a course of Practical Work in the Chemical Laboratory, either of which may be attended separately. A.âLectures. In connection with this course there is but one class, the students attending which hear three lectures each week throughout the session. Amongst the more prominent subjects discussed are: The production of Materials of very general application, including the Metallurgy of Iron, Copper, Lead, Zinc, Tin, Silver, Gold, &amp;c., the preparation and properties of Alloys, and the processes of Electro-Metallurgy, the manufacture upon the large scale of Acids, Alkalies, Salts, Glass and Porcelain; the production and preservation of Food, including the Chemistry of Agriculture, the processes of Bread Making, Wine Making, Brewing and Distilling, the manufacture of Sugar and Vinegar, the curing of Meat, the examination of Potable UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. Water, &amp;c.; Chemical Arts relating to Clothing, such as Bleaching, Dyeing, Calico Printing, Tanning, and the preparation of India Rubber; the Chemistry of those arts which afford us Shelter, embracing the examination of Building Materials, Lime Burning, the manufacture of Mortar and Cements, the Explosive Agents used in blasting, as Gunpowder, Gun Cotton, Nitro-Glycerine, &amp;c., Paints and Varnishes, Disinfecting Materials, &amp;c.; Heating and Ventilation, the different kinds of Fuel and modes of Burning them; Illumination by artificial means, Candles, Lamps, the preparation of Petroleum, the manufacture of Illuminating Gas, Matches; the Chemistry of Washing, the preparation of Soap, Starch and Perfumes; the Chemical relations of Printing and Writing, the manufacture of Paper, Ink, Artists' Colors, Photographic Materials, &amp;c. The lectures are illustrated by suitable experiments, and by such specimens, models, drawings, &amp;c., as the various subjects require. Amongst books which can be usefully referred to in connection with different parts of this course may be mentioned: MusprattâChemistry as Applied to Arts and Manufactures; Richardson and WattsâChemical Technology; UreâDictionary of Arts and Manufactures; Dumasâ TraitÃ© de Chimie AppliquÃ©e aux Arts; WagnerâDie chemische Technologie; JohnstonâAgricultural Chemistry; R. HoffmannâTheoretisch-praktische Ackerbauchemie. The subjects germane to Agriculture are treated of at different periods of the lecture course, and cannot well be brought together with a due regard to system, but the discussion more particularly of soils, manures, &amp;c., will be brought forward in January or February (this year in February), with a view to the convenience of farmers or others, not regular students of the University, who may desire to attend this portion of the course separately. Such persons are freely invited to thus temporarily join the class for the purpose in question. B.âLaboratory Course. This is arranged for three classes: 1. The First Class meets twice each week during the session, on each occasion spending from two to four hours in practical experiment in the Laboratory. A regularly arranged course of practice in Chemical Manipulation is first pursued; Qualitative Analysis is then taken up, and, the means of detecting the most important chemical substances having been learned, students are required to find out for themselves by analysis the constituents of unknown materials presented to them. Special attention is given to sub stances having useful applications in the Arts or connected with Agriculture. Towards the close of the session the elements of Quantitative Analysis are taught, so far as the limitation of time will permit. 2. The Laboratory will be open to the Second Class on five days of each week during the whole of the working hours of each day. A full course of instruction in Practical Chemistry, including the CATALOGUE OF THE Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Ores, Soils, Manures, Technical Products, &amp;c., will be given; and students will be assisted and encouraged to undertake original research. 3. The Third Class is one specially intended for students of Medicine, and will meet for lessons of two hours each once in the week for four months of the session. To this class the practical applications of Chemistry to Medicine will be taughtâthe detection of Poisons, chemical and microscopical examination of Animal Products, urine, blood, &amp;c. Amongst the works recommended to laboratory students are: FreseniusâQualitatire and Quantitative Analysis; H. RoseâHandbuch der analytischen Chemie (also in French translation); Greville Williamsâ Handbook of Chemical Manipulation; WÃ¶hlerâExamples for Practice in Chemical Analysis; BolleyâHandbuch der technisch-chemischen Untersuchungen; OdlingâPractical Chemistry for Medical Students. The Diploma of Graduate in this School will be conferred upon such students as attend with diligence the Course of Lectures and the Second Class of Laboratory Instruction, and give evidence on examination of satisfactory attainments in the same. For the requirements in this school for the degrees in Mining and Civil Engineering, &amp;c., reference is made to the general notice of Degrees. Very ample and liberal provision has been made by the Board of Visitors for the material means of illustration of the teachings of this Chair. A new Laboratory building, of one hundred and twenty feet in length, by forty-five feet in width, specially designed for the purposes it is to serve, has been erected, containing twelve roomsâa lecture-room, rooms for general analytical work, for furnace operations, for evaporations and experiments with gases, balance rooms, private laboratory, store-rooms for apparatus and reÃ¤gents, &amp;c., fitted with double windows for the preservation of uniform temperature, and amply supplied with gas, water, and all proper laboratory fixtures. All necessary apparatus, chemicals, minerals, models, &amp;c., and an unusually fine collection of specimens illustrating the various arts and manufactures as practiced on the great scale, have been procured from England, France and Germany. It may safely be said that the University of Virginia is in this department inferior in material preparation for instruction to no institution of learning in America, and, in some respects, is probably superior to any. With a portion of the means supplied by the donation of the late Mr. Samuel Miller of Lynchburg, the Board of Visitors of the University have established, in connection with this School, two scholarships, each of five hundred dollars per annum, and tenable for two years (one to be filled and one vacated in each year), to be competed for at a special examination upon the whole of the subjects taught in the school, to be held near the close of each sessionâcandidates for this examination to be graduates of the School. Scholars thus elected will be expected to continue their studies under the Professor of the School during the term of their scholarships, and to render such assistance in the minor duties of instruction, in the performance of analyses and researches, &amp;c., as may be required of them. It is hoped that thus the opportunity may be afforded such students of becoming thoroughly competent chemists, worthy of public confidence in regard to all the purposes which their special knowledge may subserve, and that even during their tenure of the scholarships in question they may be able to render useful service in the examination and analysis of agricultural and other materials of general interest. They will be subject to no charge for tuition in this School during the two years, but will be expected to defray the expense of material they may consume in the Laboratory. Agricultural Department. PROFESSORS MALLET AND BÅCK. The late Samuel Miller, of Lynchburg, having, by deed, given in trust one hundred thousand dollars, for the establishment of a Department of Scientific and Practical Agriculture at the University of Virginia, the Trustees met the Rector and Visitors of the University on the 17th of September, 1869, and arrangements were made for putting the said department in operation. The Trustees nominated, and the Visitors elected, J. W. Mallet, Ph. D., M. D., Professor of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry, and L. J. BÅck, Ph. D., Professor of Mechanics and Engineering as applied to Agriculture. The organization and entire control of the Agricultural Department belonging to the Board of Visitors, with the exception of the right and duty of the Trustees to nominate the Professors to be employed in the same, the said Board has proceeded to set apart certain lands belonging to the University as an Experimental Farm, to be conducted in conformity with the directions of the Professors of Agriculture. The foundation of two scholarships, in connection with the School of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry, has also been authorized, with the view of securing the more thorough training of students, of aptitude and zeal for experimental investigations, in those branches of knowledge and inquiry upon which the progress of scientific agriculture in this State must chiefly depend. Selections for these scholarships will be made from graduates of the school, upon com petitive examinationâone to be appointed at the close of each ses sion for the term of two years next succeeding. The donation of Mr. Miller consisting largely in State stocks, not now fully productive, and the expenditures for the Agricultural Department being limited to the income of the fund, the department, for the present, is restricted to the provisions above indicated. But it is expected that the income will, at an early day, be sufficient to enable the authorities to enlarge its scope and operations by the establishment of one or more Professorships of Natural History. Students in the Agricultural Department may, of course, avail themselves of the benefits of instruction in any of the schools of the University, on the same terms as other students.

The Medical Department is organized on the same general plan as the other departments of the University, the distinctive features of which are comprehensiveness and thoroughness of instruction, and the graduation of the student upon satisfactory evidences of attainments only, without regard to the length of time he may have been attending the lectures. An experience of more than forty years has fully attested the excellence of the plan. The scholarship of the alumni of the institution and the value of its degrees are now freely conceded by cultivated and liberal men throughout the country. The Medical Department of the University aims at thorough work in its special province, to wit: the instruction of the student in the principles of medicine, and his discipline in the modes of acquiring and applying knowledge. Thus, whilst the only solid foundation of professional attainments is laid, the mental faculties are expanded and strengthened for that growth in knowledge, usefulness and distinction, to which every one who enlists in an honorable and responsible profession should aspire. The organization and arrangements by which these aims are successfully accomplished may be briefly stated: The length of the session (nine months) renders it convenient and eligible to distribute the subjects of instruction among a smaller number of Professors than in other medical schools of the United States, whose sessions are only four or five months' long. Thus, to one Professor is assigned Comparative Anatomy, Physiology and Surgery; to another, Human Anatomy and Materia Medica; to a third, Chemistry and Pharmacy; and to a fourth, Medical Jurisprudence, Obstetrics, and the Practice of Medicine. This distribution renders it practicable to bring the different subjects to the attention of the student in their natural and successive order. The arrangement of the lectures is such that he acquires a competent knowledge of Anatomy, human and comparative, Physiology and Chemistry, before he enters upon the study of the principles and practice of Medicine and Surgery, which can only be studied properly in the lights shed upon them by the former. The instructions in Materia Medica and Pharmacy are also given in due relation to the progress of the student in Chemistry. A feature in the course of medical instruction at this University, worthy of note, is the space given to Comparative Anatomy and Comparative Physiology. The structure and functions of the organs in the human system can, in fact, be fully understood only by comparisons running through the whole animal series. The comparison of extensively varied types of animal forms, all executing substantially the same fundamental phenomena of life, enables the inquirer to ascertain what are the essential constituents of each organ, and what the essential conditions of its action. By this process knowledge is made positive by experiments ready prepared by nature, which are much more trustworthy than any that may be specially contrived by man. The introduction of Pharmacy into the course of instruction is another feature of interest, serving, as it does, to initiate the student into an art which he will find of value when he comes to the practice of his profession. Favored, as the student is, in the comprehensiveness, scientific basis and order of his studies, he is not less favored by arrangements which give ample time for the preparation of every lecture, and address motives to him for such preparation. Each Professor gives three regular lectures a week, with occasional extra lectures, making the average weekly aggregage not over fonrteen, or a little more than two a day. The student, therefore, is not over-burthened with lecture room attendance. He has time for study in his private room, to consult books and compare their teachings with the oral instructions of his Professors, and to digest and systematize his acquisitions from both sources. The daily examinations, which precede every lecture, supply the stimulus to regular and active study, serve as summary reviews of what he has already heard or read, and as correctives of any misconceptions he may have fallen into in his hearing or reading. The daily examinations constitute a very valuable part of the exercises of the Institution, and are taken into account in determining the fitness of a student for graduation. The equipment of the Medical Department in apparatus, specimens and drawings is extensive and excellent. The collection of paintings for the illustration of the lectures on anatomy, physiology and surgery, several hundred in number, is unequaled by anything of the kind in the United States, or perhaps abroad. A skillful artist was diligently engaged for six years in executing them, under the direction and critical supervision of the Professors. They delineate the tissues, muscles, heart and blood vessels, brain, spinal marrow and nerves, the organs of sense, the thoracic, abdominal and pelvic viscera, and indeed all the structures and organs of the human body with admirable accuracy and distinctness, are of great value as helps to lucid instruction in the branches to which they relate. In all the other branches, the appropriate means of illustration of every topic of discussion are likewise at hand, and are duly utilized. The Department furnishes every facility for the study of practical anatomy that can be furnished in similar institutions elsewhere. Adequate provision is made for the supply of subjects, and each student has the opportunity, by actual dissections, under the guidance of the Demonstrator of Anatomy, of acquiring a practical knowledge of the structure of the human body in all its parts. The University offers no facilities for clinical instruction. There are no public hospitals for the sick in the vicinity; nor, in the present connection, is this a source of regret. The aim of the Medical Department is to lay a thorough foundation for medical acquirements and to indoctrinate the student in the principles of the profession. When well versed in the principles of medicine, he is prepared to profit by clinical instruction, and not before. The value of clinical instruction is freely conceded; but it is an unprofitable use of time for the first-course student to give his attention to it. No class of medical students are more eager than those who have attended the full course of medical lectures at this Institution to seek instruction at the bedside of the sick, whether under the guidance of the private practitioner, or under the more ample, varied and systematic teachings of clinical lecturers in public hospitals; and none, it may be safely said, are better qualified to profit by it. In proof may be adduced the fact that a large proportion, much larger than any influence save that of merit could secure, find their way to eligible and responsible positions on the house staffs of the great city hospitals after leaving this University. The degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred upon such students as prove their fitness for the same by rigid and searching examinations. It has ever been the policy of the Institution to make its honors testimonials of merit, and not certificates of attendance on a prescribed course of instruction. In accordance with this policy, the degree of Doctor of Medicine may be conferred upon a first-course student, if found worthy of it. Not only is it within the reach of the intelligent, diligent and persevering to graduate in one session of nine months, but, in point of fact, many do thus graduate. A longer time, however, is often devoted to the necessary preparation, and wisely, when circumstances permit. It is not an unusual case that an academic student, looking forward to medicine as his profession, conjoins a part of the medical with his academic studies during one session; and during the next, entering as a medical student proper, he is enabled to graduate, at the close thereof, with comparative ease. But the majority of the students who attend medical lectures in this Institution do not graduate here. They spend one session in reaping its well known advantages, and subsequently resort to the city schools to secure their degrees and profit by the facilities afforded for clinical instruction. As a class, the excellence of their preparation is recognized in all the leading city schools of this country, and this appreciation generally proves a ready passport to success in achieving their special objects. The University of Virginia is resorted to by many of the young men of the South, and by some from other sections, seeking higher culture in literature and science, as well as in the learned professions. They bring with them the well-marked characteristics of a manly, sincere and generous people, and form a fraternity, the source of pleasant recollections and beneficial influences in after life. The opportunity thus afforded of forming associations with contemporaries, who are to be the cultivated and leading men of their day 6 throughout a wide section of country, is not unworthy of regard by those who are preparing for the medical profession. This consideration, in addition to the ample facilities for special and professional instruction, as the tastes and purposes of the student may dictate, will, it is believed, continue to invite to the Medical Department not only Southern students, but also students from the North and West, who may wish to attend an Institution comprehensive in its plan and organization, catholic in its teachings, and national in its spirit. ? In addition to the usual course of Medical Lectures, a special course, for such medical students as may desire to pursue it, of sixteen (16) lessons in the practical applications of chemistry to medicine (the detection of poisons, chemical and microscopic examinations of animal products, urine, blood, &amp;c.,) will be given by the Professor of Applied Chemistry, at a charge of $20 tuition fee and $5 for laboratory material consumed. Attendance on this special course is optional with the student. ? The expenses of the Medical student amount to $386 per session of nine months, commencing 1st of October. (See expenses, page 47.) Law Department. This Department is organized with a view to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through text-books and partly through lectures, with daily examinations upon both. A Moot-Court, in connection with other instruction, tends to perfect the student in the details of practice. Under the immediate supervision of the Professors, he is required to pronounce opinions upon supposed cases; to devise and institute remedies, by suit or otherwise; to conduct suits at Law and in Equity from their inception through all their stages; to draw wills, conveyances and other assurances; and in short to perform most of the functions of a practising lawyer. The Department comprises two Schools, each of which is divided into two classes, and the course of study is as follows: SCHOOL OF COMMON AND STATUTE LAW. PROF. JOHN B. MINOR. Junior Class.âBlackstone's Commentaries, Chitty on Contracts. Senior Class.âStephen on Pleading, Kents Commentaries, Law of Executors, &amp;c. ? For Reference.âVirginia Code (1860); Brightley's Digest of United States Statutes. SCHOOL OF EQUITY, MERCANTILE AND INTERNATIONAL, CONSTITUTIONAL AND CIVIL LAW, AND GOVERNMENT. PROF. S. O. SOUTHALL. Junior Class.âVattel's International Law, Lectures on Government, Federalist. Senior Class.âSmith's Mercantile Law, Greenleaf's Evidence, Barton's Suit in Equity, Adams' Equity. In the Department of Law, the degree of Bachelor of Law is conferred upon those who, upon examination conducted in writing, manifest an intimate acquaintance with the subjects taught in all the classes; and to those who, upon like examination, exhibit a competent knowledge of International and Constitutional Law, and of the Science of Government, a certificate of Proficiency is awarded. The expenses of a Law student, as will be seen from page 47 of Catalogue, amount to about $356 for a session of nine months, commencing 1st October, 1870. LICENTIATES. Any person of unexceptionable character and habits, upon producing to the Faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity and attainments, will be licensed by the Faculty to form classes for private instruction in any School of the University in aid of and in conformity to the public teachings of the Professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment, selection and compensation of any such Licentiate is left to the option of the students.

Ap. Ch. EXAMINATIONS. The examinations are of three kinds: 1, the Daily examinations; 2, the Intermediate and Final general examinations; and 3, the examinations for Graduation. 1.âDaily Examinations. Each Professor, before commencing the lecture of the day, examines his class orally on the subject of the preceding lecture as developed in the text-book and expounded in the lecture. 2.âGeneral Examinations. Two general examinations of each class are held during the session, in the presence of a committee of the Faculty, which every student is required to stand. The first, called the Intermediate examination, is held about the middle of the session, and embraces in its scope the subjects of instruction in the first half of the course. The second, called the Final examination, is held in the closing week of the session, and embraces the subjects treated of in the second half of the course. These examinations are conducted in writing. The questions propunded have, each, numerical values attached to them. If the answers of the students are valued, in the aggregate, at not less than three-fourths of the aggregate values assigned to the questions, he is ranked in the first division: if less than three-fourths and more than one-half, in the second division; if less than one half and more than one-fourth, in the third division; and if less than one fourth, in the fourth division. Certificates of distinction are awarded to those who attain the first division at one or both of these examinations, and their names are published or announced in the closing exercises of the session. The general examinations are sufficiently comprehensive and difficult to render it impossible for the student, without steady diligence, to secure a place in the first division. The results, whatever they may be, are communicated to parents and guardians respectively, in the final circular of the session. The standing of the student at the daily and general examinations is taken into account in ascertaining his qualifications for graduation in any of the schools. 3.âExaminations for Graduation. The examinations for graduation are held in the last month of the session. They are conducted, in each school, by the Professor thereof, in the presence of two other Professors, forming, with him, the committee of examination for the school. The candidates for graduation are subjected to searching interrogations on the details and niceties, as well as the leading principles of the subject, and they are expected to be accurately versed in all the topics treated of in the lectures and correlative text. These examinations are carried on chiefly in writing; but in some of the schools they are partly oral. ? As a due acquaintance with the English language is indispensable to the attainment of even the inferior honors of the institution, all candidates for graduation are subjected to a preliminary examination to test their qualifications in this respect. DEGREES. The degrees conferred by the University are Academic and Professional. The Academic Degrees are: 1. That of Proficientâconferred for satisfactory attainments in certain subjects of study, to wit: in Anglo-Saxon, the Junior and Intermediate course of Mathematics, Mineralogy and Geology, Physics, Physiology, Medical Jurisprudence, Human Anatomy; Botany, Political Economy, History, Literature, International Law and Government, and the lecture course of Applied Chemistry. 2. That of Graduate in a Schoolâconferred for satisfactory attainments in the leading subjects of instruction in the same, to wit: in the Latin Language and Literature, in the Greek Language and Literature, in the French Language and Literature, in the German Language and Literature, Mixed Mathematics, Pure Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Moral Philosophy, History and Literature, Applied Mathematics, and Analytical, Industrial and Agricultural Chemistry. 3. That of Bachelor of Lettersâconferred upon such students as have graduated in the Schools of Ancient and Modern Languages, Moral Philosophy, and History and Literature. 4. That of Bachelor of Scienceâconferred on such students as have graduated in the Schools of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy and Chemistry, and who are also Proficients in the Classes of Anatomy, Physiology, Comparative Anatomy, Botany, Mineralogy and Geology, and who have obtained distinctions in the Junior Class of Applied Mathematics, and made satisfactory attainments in the first Laboratory class of Analytical Chemistry. 5. That of Bachelor of Artsâconferred on such students as have graduated in Latin, Greek, Chemistry, Moral Philosophy and French or German, and have obtained certificates of proficiency in Junior and Intermediate Mathematics, Physics and History or Literature. 6. That of Master of Arts of the University of Virginiaâconferred upon students who have graduated in the Latin, Greek, French and German Languages, Pure Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Moral Philosophy, and History and Literature, and who have passed satisfactory general examinations, in review, on all the subjects embraced in the curriculum. The candidate for the degree of Bachelor or Master of Arts is also required to submit to the approval of the Faculty an Essay, composed by himself, on some subject of literature or science, which essay must be read by the author on the Public Day, if so ordered. The Professional Degrees are: 1. That of Bachelor of Lawâconferred for satisfactory attainments in all the subjects of instruction in the School of Law. 2. That of Doctor of Medicineâconferred for satisfactory attainments in all the subjects of instruction, except Botany, in the several schools constituting the Medical Department. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine, who have been previously declared Graduates in Chemistry or Proficients in Anatomy, Physiology or Medical Jurisprudence, are not required to stand the examinations on these subjects anew; and the same rule applies to candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Law, who are Proficients in International Law and Government. 3. That of Civil Engineerâconferred on such students as have graduated in the Schools of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Applied Mathematics, and Chemistry or Applied Chemistry (Proficiency in the Lecture course), and obtained a certficate of proficiency in Mineralogy and Geology. 4. That of Mining Engineerâconferred on such students as have graduated in the Schools of Chemistry, Applied Chemistry and Natural Philosophy, and obtained certificates of proficiency in Junior and Intermediate Mathematics, in a prescribed course of Applied Mathematics, and in Mineralogy and Geology. 5. That of Civil and Mining Engineerâconferred on such students as have graduated in Pure Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, including Mineralogy and Geology, Chemistry, Applied Mathematics and Applied Chemistry. ? Honorary degrees are forbidden by the laws of the University. PUBLIC DAY. On the closing day of the session, which occurs on the Thursday before the fourth day of July, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers and Students of the University assemble in the Public Hallâwhither also the friends of the students and the public generally are invited. On this occasion the results of the examinations are announced, certificates and diplomas awarded, and addresses delivered by the Bachelors and Masters of Arts. EXPENSES. The charges common to all classes of students, if two occupy the same room, are as follows: Matriculation and library fee, $25 00 Room-rent, 15 00 Contingent deposit, 10 00 Infirmary fee, 7 50 Fuel and lights, about 25 00 Board, including diet, room furniture and servants' attendance, 180 00 Washing, $1 50 per monthâper session, 13 50 $276 00 The tuition fees of Academic students attending three schools (the usual number attended in one session) amount to $75; of Law students to $80; of students of Civil Engineering to $90; and of Medical students to $110. Adding tuition fees to the above estimate of common expenses ($276) gives the aggregate of the necessary expenses of students, exclusive of text-books, clothing and pocket-money, as follows: Academic students, $351 Law students, 356 Engineering students, 366 Medical students, 386 There is a specific scale of tuition fees for the students of Analytical, Industrial and Agricultural Chemistry. For the Lecture course, on the applications of Chemistry to the Arts, the fee is $25, as in other schools. For the first Laboratory class $50, and an additional charge of $10 for Laboratory material consumed. For the second Laboratory class $100, and a charge of $25 for Laboratory material consumed. For the third Laboratory class (special course for Medical students) $20, and a charge of $5 for Laboratory material consumed. Each Laboratory student, in whatever course of instruction, will be required to furnish himself with the more common and generally necessary articles of apparatus. The cost of a suitable set need not exceed $15. All the foregoing items are payable in advance, except board and washing. One-third ($60) of the board is required on admission, and the balance in equal instalments at three and six months thereafter. Washing is paid for monthly, as the service is rendered. The contingent deposit is designed to cover any assessments that may be made against the student during the session for violation of the rules of the library, damage to books, room, &amp;c. The residue, less these assessments, which are generally small, and may be nothing, is refunded to the student on the settlement of his account at the close of the session. There is a well-appointed Infirmary connected with the University, for the care and comfort of sick students. Every student, on admission, deposits the Infirmary fee ($7 50), which entitles him, in case of sickness during the session, to the advice and attention of the Infirmary physicians (Professors in the Medical Department), and, if necessary, nursing by professional nurses, without additional charge. There are three large boarding-houses within the precincts of the University, and several outside, but in the immediate vicinity. At these nearly all the students find accommodations, and at charges essentially the same. A few find accommodations in private families, mostly with near relatives or intimate friends. A few also, for the sake of economy, mess together and board themselves. With the exception of a deduction of 20 per cent. in the tuition fees in favor of those who enter after the 1st of January, no abatement is made in the matriculation and tuition fees and room-rent on account of late entrance, and no portion of the same is refunded on account of withdrawal before the close of the sessionâunless the withdrawal be rendered necessary by ill health, and occur before the 1st of March. The charges for board, fuel, lights, and washing, are estimated from the time of entrance. Many disadvantages to the student result from late entrance; therefore, prompt attendance at the beginning of the session is earnestly enjoined upon all who wish to derive the full benefits of the courses of instruction. PROHIBITION OF CREDIT. An act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students. The license to contract debts, which the chairman is authorized to grant, is confined (except where the parent or guardian otherwise, in writing, requests) to 7 cases of urgent necessity; and these, it is hoped, parents and guardians will, as far as possible, prevent from arising, by the timely supply of the requisite funds. PRIVILEGED STUDENTS. Ministers of the Gospel may attend any of the schools of the University without the payment of fees to the Professors. The same privilege will be extended to any young man preparing for the ministry, on the following conditions: (1.) He shall submit, for the consideration of the Faculty, an application, accompanied by testimonials, relating to the fact of his being a bona fide candidate for the ministry, to his good standing in the church of which he is a member, to his intellectual capacity, and his inability to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. (2.) No Professor shall be required to form a new class or assume any other additional labor for the exclusive benefit of this class of students. MONTHLY CIRCULAR. At the end of every month a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from lectures and examinations, and any other irregularity of which he may have been guilty, together with such further information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate. The object of such report being, on the one hand, to incite the student to steady diligence, by eliciting the commendation and encouragement of his friends, and on the other to restrain him from idleness and disorder, or to urge him to the amendment by their admonition and advice; the usefulness of these circulars greatly depends upon the prompt and judicious attention they receive from those to whom they are addressed. Parents and guardians, therefore, cannot be too earnest in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly report may suggest. LIBRARY. The library of the University, originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, and since enlarged by purchases and donations, now contains about 35,000 volumes. Among the recent donations may be mentioned those of A. A. Low and Robert Gordon, Esqs., of the city of New York. Each of these gentlemen has left a graceful memento of a visit to the University, in the unsolicited present of a considerable sum of money for the increase of the library. Such acts of generosity deserve a grateful record. Students are allowed the use of the books, under the usual restrictions, and the librarian is present in the library for four hours daily, to attend to their wants. SOCIETY OF ALUMNI. This Association is composed of such former students of the University as, having finally left the Institution, have been elected members at the annual meetings. Its objects are the promotion of letters and general education, as well as the renewal, from year to year, of the pleasing associations of academic life. The Society holds its meetings at the close of the session. An orator or an essayist is annually appointed by the Society from among its members, and the oration or essay is delivered in the Public Hall on the day preceding the Public Day. LITERARY SOCIETIES. There are two Literary Societies, of long standing, connected with the University. Most of the students become members of one or the other. They meet weekly in their respective Halls, for the purpose of cultivating debate and composition, and occasionally hold public exhibitions. MORALITY AND RELIGION. These are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity, and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience has proved that the best way to effect this result is to forbear the employment of coercion to enforce attendance on religious exercises, which is entirely voluntary. Prayers are held every morning in the Chapel, and divine service is performed on Sunday by a chaplain selected, in turn, from the principal religious denominations. By means of a Young Men's Christian Association, new comers are shielded, as much as possible, from vicious connections, and the energies of students willing to engage in the Christian enterprises of the neighborhood are called into active exercise. STATE STUDENTS. To render education at the University accessible to meritorious young men of limited means, provision has been made by the Legislature for the admission of one student from each Senatorial District of the State, without payment of matriculation and tuition fees and rents. This provision is meant to be restricted to those who are not themselves, and whose parents are not, in a situation to incur the expense of their education at this Institution, without aid. State students are appointed by the Faculty upon satisfactory testimonials of fitness. The term of appointment is for two years, but for extraordinary proficiency it may be prolonged. They stand in all respects, except expense, on the same footing as other students, enjoying the same privileges and subject to the same laws. By way of remuneration to the State for the aid afforded them, they are required, on admission, to sign an engagement to teach in some public or private school in Virginia for two years after leaving the University, the emoluments of such service enuring, of course, to their own benefit. The applicant for a State appointment should state his age (which must be at least seventeen), and designate the Schools of the University he may wish to enter. He should submit satisfactory testimonials of irreproachable moral character and of capacity, as well by partial cultivation as original vigor of mind, to profit by the instruction given at the University. It should also appear that neither he nor his parents are able to incur the expense of his education without aid. The Faculty will proceed, on the 2d day of July, 1870, to make appointments of State students for vacant districts. The following are the districts under the new Constitution, all of which, except those indicated by an asterisk, will be vacant at the close of the present session. ?
