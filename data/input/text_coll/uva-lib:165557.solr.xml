      <field name="fulltext">UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. A STATEMENT OF THE Course of Instruction, Expense, &amp;c., IN THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. MATRICULATION. To be admitted into the University, the student must be sixteen years of age; but the Faculty are authorized to dispense with this requisition in the case of application for admission by two brothers, one of whom is under the age of sixteen. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he cannot be received but on producing a certificate from such seminary, or other evidence satisfactory to the Faculty, testifying to his general good conduct. Every student is free to attend the schools of his choice, and no other than he chooses; with the condition that he shall attend at least three professors, unless he has the written authority of his parent or guardian, or the Faculty shall for good cause shown allow him to attend less than three. Should he be twenty-one years of age, or more, he is exempt from this condition. Before a student matriculates, he is furnished with a copy of the laws, which he is required to read. On matriculating, he signs a written declaration, that he will conform to those laws, and if he be a resident student, that he has deposited with the Patron all the funds in his possession. CATALOGUE. COURSE OF INSTRUCTION. The session commences on the 1st of October, and continues without interruption until the 29th of June. The mode of instruction is by lectures and text-books, accompanied by daily and stated examinations. In each school there are three regular lectures a week, besides many others suited to the several subjects into which the school is divided. Literary and Scientific Schools: I.âLATIN. PROFESSOR HARRISON. The subjects of instruction are the Latin Language and the Roman History and Literature. It is endeavored to make the practical study of the language more thorough and more profitable, by connecting it with the scientific investigation of the doctrines of the grammar and of the etymology. The latter involves a regard to comparative etymology. To the Roman History and Literature, with the related subjects, so much attention is given as is found to be compatible with the duty, more urgent as yet, of meeting the actual wants of students in regard to the practical knowledge of the language, and to a just theory of it. They occupy, however, as heretofore they have done, one-third of the time allotted to the Senior Class. Text Books.âIn the Junior Class: Zumpt's Latin Grammar, the Professor's Exposition, Arnold's Latin Prose Composition, Virgil, Horace, Terence, CÃ¦sar's Commentarii, Cicero's Orations, and his EpistolÃ¦ ad Diversos, (Familiares,) Freund's Lexicon, abridged by Andrews, and Riddle's English Latin Lexicon. In the Senior Class: the same Grammar and Lexicons, the Professor's Exposition, Horace, Juvenal, Livy, Tacitus, and Cicero's EpistolÃ¦ ad Diversos, (Familiares.) Other authors, and parts of authors, are recommended to be read privately by the student, both for exercise in the language, and for the acquisition UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. of the only knowledge of the literature that is comparatively of much profit; e. g. Cicero de Officiis, de Republica, &amp;c., Terence, Plautus, &amp;c. In the Roman History and Literature, Arnold's History of Rome, Niebuhr's Roman History, the History of Rome published by U. Kn. Soc., Long's Ancient Atlas, Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities, (2d ed.,) and Browne's History of Roman Literature, are recommended. The students of both classes are required to furnish written exercises, chiefly translations from English into Latin. In the examination of candidates for degrees, the passages given for the written translations are selected, not from the portions of authors which have been read and explained in the lecture-room, but from the classic writers at will. II.âGREEK. PROFESSOR GILDERSLEEVE. The subjects taught in this school, are: 1. The Greek language. 2. Greek literature. 3. History of Greece. The method of instruction comprises lectures, (systematic and exegetical,) examinations and written exercises. This school is divided into two classesâJunior and Senior. The classic authors read in the Senior Class, are principally: Thucydides, Sophocles, Euripides and Plato; in the Junior Class: Xenophon, Herodotus, Homer and Demosthenes. A private course of parallel and preparatory reading is also prescribed for each class. Works of reference.âFor the lectures on the structure and syntax of the language, KÃ¼hner's Grammars. For the lectures on the History of Greece, (Senior Class,) Thirlwall's and Grote's History of Greece. The written exercises and the comments on the corrections constitute a prominent feature in the plan of instruction. 4. The Hebrew language. Text Books.âBiblia Hebraica, RÃ¶diger's Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar, and Gesenius' Lexicon Manuale Hebraicum et Chaldaicum. CATALOGUE. III.âMODERN LANGUAGES. PROFESSOR SCHELE DE VERE. ASSISTANT INSTRUCTOR, JOS. WALL. The subjects taught in this school, are: 1. The French, Italian, Spanish and German Languages, and the English in its Anglo-Saxon form. 2. The Literature of these Languages, and the history of each idiom. 3. The History and Geography of Europe, from the fall of the Roman Empire to the present day. Instruction is also given in Comparative Philology and the principles of the Science of Language. There are three classes in French and two in German, one for beginners, the others for more advanced students; and the same arrangement is made, when necessary, in the other languages. Opportunity is also given, in private, to practice speaking the languages. The method of instruction is by lectures, examinations, written exercises, and comments on the text-books as read in the lecture-room; the principal classic authors in each language being used for this purpose. Two degrees in this school are required for the degree of A. M. IV.âMATHEMATICS. PROFESSOR BLEDSOE. ASSISTANT INSTRUCTOR, EDWARD B. SMITH. In this school there are four classes: In the first, or Junior Class, the student commences with the study of Algebra; as he is supposed to have rendered himself familiar with the various rules of Arithmetic before he enters the University. After the first difficulties of Algebra are mastered, the subjects of Algebra and Synthetic Geometry are simultaneously pursued, until they are completed. Trigonometry and Surveying are also taught to this class. In the second, or Intermediate Class, the subjects taught are: Nautical Astronomy, Navigation, Descriptive Geometry, with its application to Spherical Projections, Shadows, and Perspective, and Analytical Geometry. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. The Senior Class studies the Differential and Integral Calculus. To this class, a course of lectures is delivered on the History of Mathematics, and another course on the Philosophy of Mathematics. There is also a class of Mixed Mathematics, designed exclusively for such of the more advanced students as may desire to study the subjects taught therein. The course embraces the mathematical investigation of the general laws of equilibrium and motion, both of solids and fluids, with a variety of applications, especially to Physical Astronomy. The instruction in each class is conveyed partly by lectures, and partly by the systematic study of approved text-books, the student being assisted by full and frequent explanations from the Professor, and being constantly subjected to rigid examinations. The progress of the student in every class is also tested by his being required to perform written exercises, in which the principles acquired are applied to the solution of particular problems. The text-books used are: For the Junior Class, Davies' Bourdon's Algebra, Legendre's Geometry and Trigonometry. For the Intermediate Class, Pierce's Trigonometry, Davies' Surveying, Descriptive Geometry, and Analytical Geometry. For the Senior Class, Courtenay's Differential and Integral Calculus. For the Class of Mixed Mathematics, Pratt's Mechanical Philosophy. Any student entering the school has the privilege of attending all or any of the classes, as he may elect, and if prepared to enter an advanced class, may often find it highly advantageous to review his previous studies by an attendance on a lower class also. V.âNATURAL PHILOSOPHY. PROFESSOR SMITH. There are three classes in this school: the Junior and Senior Classes of Natural Philosophy, and the class of Mineralogy and Geology. Instruction is given in all the classes by lectures and the study of the text-books, accompanied by daily examinations. The Junior Class meets three times a week. The course of lectures to this class commences with a view of the structure and CATALOGUE. general properties of matter, as preliminary to an exposition of the leading doctrines of equilibrium and motion. In the latter is included the application of these doctrines to a variety of subjects, embracing, among others, the centre of gravity, simple and compound machinery, the pendulum, projectiles, the figure of the earth and the laws of gravitation. This is followed by a consideration of the special structure and properties of fluids, together with the laws of their pressure, motion and resistance. The theory and construction of the principal Pneumatic and Hydraulic machines are then presented. To this succeeds a more particular investigation of molecular actions, as exhibited in osmotic and capillary phenomena, and in wave motion. In the latter half of the course, are considered in succession, Acoustics; Optics, Geometrical and Physical; Electricity, Mechanical and Voltaic; Magnetism, Electro-Magnetism, &amp;c., and Heat, including the Steam Engine. The subjects taught in this course are illustrated by numerous experiments, and by the aid of a large collection of diagrams. The Senior Class meets twice a week. In this class, certain portions of the Junior course are more thoroughly discussed by the aid of the lower Mathematics. This course embraces, in addition, the subject of Astronomy. Text-Books.âFor the Junior Class: Rogers' Mechanical Philosophy; Muller's Physics or Lardner's Hand-books. For the Senior Class: Written Lectures on Mechanics; Norton's Astronomy. MINERALOGY AND GEOLOGY. These subjects form a separate department of the school of Natural Philosophy. They are studied in the order named. Mineralogy is taught with especial reference to its bearings on Geology. Throughout the course, specimens are exhibited of the minerals, rocks and fossils alluded to or described in the lectures. Text-Books.âDana's Mineralogy; Lyell's Manual of Geology. VI.âCHEMISTRY. PROFESSOR MAUPIN. The course of lectures in this school commences with an exposition of the phenomena and laws of Heat, Light and Electricity, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. in so far as is rendered necessary by their relations to chemistry. The subject of inorganic Chemistry is then taken up. The nomenclature, and chemical symbols and notation are explained, and the history of the non-metallic elements and their combinations with each other, very fully presented. Then follows a discussion of the general principles of Chemical Philosophy, including the Laws of Combination, the Atomic Theory and Theory of Volumes, and Simple and Current Affinity. The consideration of the Metals comes next in order. After preliminary notices of their general properties, the Constitution and Classification of Salts, Crystallization, Isomorphism, &amp;c., they are taken up individually and very fully considered, together with their compounds with the non-metallic elements, and their saline combinations. The concluding part of the course is devoted to Organic Chemistry, embracing the consideration of Organic Analysis; the Neutral Principles and their transformations by the action of ferments and other agencies; the Doctrine of Compound Radicals; the various series in which such radicals have been traced; the Vegetable Acids; the Alkaloids, &amp;c. The processes for detecting Poisons, and the means of counteracting their effects are presented in their proper connexions, and throughout the course the applications of the facts and principles of the science to Medicine, Agriculture and the Arts, are duly noticed. Books recommended.âFowne's Chemistry, as a text book; Graham's Elements; Regnault's Elements, and Abel &amp; Bloxam's Hand-book of Chemistry for reference. VII.âMORAL PHILOSOPHY. PROFESSOR McGUFFEY. There are two classes in this school. The Senior Class studies Mental and Moral Philosophy, the first half the session, Logic, Belles-Lettres and Criticisms, the second. Books requisite for the Senior Class: Mental PhilosophyâLocke, Cousin, Reed and Hamilton. CATALOGUE. Moral PhilosophyâStewart, Jouffroy, Butler and Alexander. LogicâWhately and Mill. Belles-LettresâBlair, Campbell, Kames, Milton and Shakspeare. The Junior Class studies Political Economy, Statistics, and the Philosophy of Social Relations or "Ethics of Society." Books requisite for the Junior Class: Political EconomyâSay and J. S. Mill. Progress of SocietyâGuizot, Grimke and De Tocqueville. Four lectures each week are given to the Senior Class, and two to the Junior. VIII.âHISTORY AND GENERAL LITERATURE. PROFESSOR HOLMES. (This department, but recently established, will not go into operation until October 1st, 1857.) UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. Medical Schools: IX.âMEDICINE. PROFESSOR HOWARD. In this school are taught the Principles and Practice of Medicine, Obstetrics and Medical Jurisprudence. To allow the medical student time to attain proficiency in Anatomy and Physiology, Chemistry and Materia Medica, before he is required to apply these branches in the study of the Principles and the Practice of Medicine, the course is opened with Medical Jurisprudence, which is followed by Obstetrics, and both are completed before the Principles or the Practice of Medicine are entered upon. MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. The lectures on this branch show the aid which legislation and the administration of the laws derive from medicine, and consist chiefly in the application of the Principles of Medical Science to the elucidation and administration of the laws, and the legal decisions in cases of insanity, every variety of mental impairment, crime, &amp;c., &amp;c. Text-Book.âThe Professor's Outlines, and Beck or Taylor. OBSTETRICS. The lectures on this branch comprehend an account of all labors, natural, preternatural and instrumental; the professional assistance to be afforded in each, and the treatment of the female before, during and after delivery. The lectures are amply illustrated by specimens and plates; and all manual evolutions, and the application of instruments, are demonstrated on the improved phantom of Hebermehl. The students also practice manual and instrumental delivery on the manikin. Text-Book.âThe last edition of Meigs' Midwifery. CATALOGUE. THE PRINCIPLES OF MEDICINE. The Principles of Medicine, as taught in this school, comprise General Pathology, and a brief view of General Therapeutics; also Etiology, Nosology, Semeiology, Diagnosis and Prognosis. The nature and division of causes are first considered, which introduces the student to their effectsâdisease. Pathology proper is next considered under the two forms, Functional and Structural diseases. After the student thoroughly understands the nature of the causes of diseases, their divisions, modes of operation, and the resulting effects upon function and structure, a general view is given of the influences that can be brought to remove or counteract their effects. And the course on the Principles is then concluded by the consideration of Nosology, Semeiology, Diagnosis, Prognosis, and the Different Modes of Death. Text-Books.âWood's General Pathology and General Therapeutics, in the last edition of his Practice. PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, OR SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SPECIAL THERAPEUTICS. As the most natural and practically useful arrangement, all local diseases are classified and treated of according to their locality, or the organ or set of organs which they affect; whilst general diseases are arranged altogether pathologically. Much attention is given to Physical Diagnosis. Pathological Anatomy occupies a conspicuous place in the course, and is illustrated by Carswell's large and splendid colored plates, and, when practicable, by specimens. Text-Book.âWood's Practice of Medicine, last edition. X.âCOMPARATIVE ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY AND SURGERY. PROFESSOR CABELL. The heading indicates the subjects taught in this school, and the order in which they are discussed. In the first part of the course, the Professor presents a general 3UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. outline of the Animal Kingdom, by demonstrating such of the leading facts of Comparative Anatomy as may serve to indicate the natural affinities between the different members of the animal series, and to furnish a basis for a natural Zoological classification. In the second division of the course, which is mainly devoted to the study of Human Physiology, the peculiarities of structure of inferior animals are again noticed, with reference, especially, to the varieties of the same organ in different animals, in order to exhibit the simplest condition of structure essential to its office, and to indicate the uses of the superadded parts in the more complicated forms. The third portion of the course is exclusively devoted to the study of the Principles and Practice of Surgery. Text-Books.âThe Professor's "Syllabus of Lectures on Comparative Anatomy and Physiology;" Carpenter's Elements of Physiology; Kirke's and Paget's Human Physiology; Druitt's Modern Surgery. XI.âCHEMISTRY. PROFESSOR MAUPIN. Medical students attend the course of Lectures on Chemistry, &amp;c., mentioned under "VI. Chemistry." A course of instruction in Pharmacy, designed for the benefit of the students of Medicine, commences in March and continues until the close of the session. Text Book.âParrish's Practical Pharmacy. XII.âANATOMY, MATERIA MEDICA AND BOTANY. PROFESSOR DAVIS. ANATOMY. In this class are taught Special and Surgical Anatomy. The lectures are illustrated by fresh subjects, by wet and dry preparations, and by an extensive series of highly finished paintings. Text-Book.âWilson's Anatomy. CATALOGUE. MATERIA MEDICA. The course on this subject embraces: 1. General Therapeutics, or an account of the effects of the various classes of remedies on the organism, their modus operandi, and their applications to the relief of disease. 2. A detailed account of medicinal agents, in their commercial history, physical properties, chemical relations, pharmaceutical preparations, and effects on the system both in health and in disease. The means of illustration in Materia Medica consist of a superb cabinet of medicines, and a large collection of colored drawings of medical plants. Text-Book.âDunglison's Therapeutics and Materia Medica. BOTANY. The Natural History of the Vegetable Kingdom is taught in this class. It therefore treats of the Anatomy and Physiology of Plantsâthe principles and classification employed in arranging them according to the "Natural" and the "Artificial" methods, and the characteristics of the various groups. The applications of Botany to Materia Medica are constantly kept in view, and incidental reference is had to the relations which it sustains to Agriculture, Geology, and Physical Geography. XIII.âDEPARTMENT OF PRACTICAL ANATOMY. DR. B. W. ALLEN, DEMONSTRATOR. This department is abundantly provided with fresh subjects for the use of the members of the class; the afternoon is devoted to the dissections; and they are conducted under the constant guidance of the demonstrator. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. Law School. XIV.âCOMMON AND STATUTE LAW. PROFESSOR MINOR. XV.âCIVIL, CONSTITUTIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, Etc. PROFESSOR HOLCOMBE. The object in this school is to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. With this view, instruction (which is designed to be as thorough as possible) is given partly through text-books and daily examinations upon the subjects taught; partly by comments intended to supply what is deficient and explain what is obscure in the text, and partly also by independent lectures. A Moot-Court is instituted in connection with the school, upon a plan which experience has shown to be well calculated to perfect the student in the details of practice. Under the immediate superintendence of the Professors, he is required to pronounce opinions upon supposed cases; to devise and to institute remedies, by suit or otherwise; to conduct suits at law and in chancery, from their inception, through all their stages; to draw wills, conveyances and other assurances; and, in short, to perform most of the functions of a practising lawyer. The school forms two Departments, each of which is divided into two classes, and the course of study therein is as follows: DEPARTMENT OF COMMON AND STATUTE LAW. PROFESSOR MINOR. Junior Class.âBlackstone's Commentaries, Chitty on Contracts. Senior Class.âStephen on Pleading, Lomax's Digest of the Law of Real Property, Law of Executors, &amp;c. CATALOGUE. For Reference.âVirginia Code of 1849, Gordon's Digest of United States' Statutes. DEPARTMENT OF EQUITY, MERCANTILE, INTERNATIONAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, AND GOVERNMENT, ETC. PROFESSOR HOLCOMBE. Junior Class.âLectures on Government, Federalist, Duer's Outlines of the Constitution, Madison's Report 1799, Polson's Law of Nations, Select Chapters of Vattel's Law of Nations. Senior Class.âSmith's Mercantile Law, Greenleaf's Evidence, Barton's Suit in Equity, Adams's Equity. The degree of Bachelor of Laws is conferred upon those who, upon examination, manifest a familiar acquaintance with the subjects taught in all the classes; and to those who exhibit a competent knowledge of International and Constitutional Law and of the science of Government, a certificate of proficiency is awarded. All the books required can be procured at the book stores near the University on reasonable terms. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. EXAMINATIONS. These are of three kinds: first, the daily examinations, which precede the lectures; second, the public examinations, two in number, held the one about the middle of the session, the other at its close; and, third, the examinations for graduation, held towards the end of the session. I.âDAILY EXAMINATIONS. In the daily examinations the student is questioned both upon the subject of the preceding lecture and such portions of the text-book as may have been designated by the Professor. His preparation thus tested is noted at the time of examination, and if the student shall exhibit material delinquency, the fact is communicated to his parent or guardian in the printed circular which is sent home at the close of every month. II.âPUBLIC EXAMINATIONS. The two public examinations, embracing respectively all the subjects treated of in the first half, and all those treated of in the second half of the session, are thus conducted: The professor of the school prepares in writing a series of questions to be proposed to the class, and affixes to them numerical values, according to his estimate of their relative difficulty. On the assembling of the class for examination, these questions are for the first time presented to them; and they are required to answer in writing in a prescribed time, without communication with one another or with other persons, and without any reference to books. Their answers are subsequently carefully examined and prepared, and a value attached to each, not exceeding that of the corresponding question. In the schools of languages, subjects are also selected for oral examination, and the value of these exercises marked at the time. The students are then arranged into four divisions, according to the merit of their examination, as determined by the following method: The numerical values attached to all the questions are added together, and also the values of the answers given by each CATALOGUE. student. If this last number amounts to three-fourths of the first, the student is ranked in the first division; if it be less than three-fourths, and as much as one-half, in the second; if less than one-half, and as much as a fourth, in the third; if less than a fourth, in the fourth division. The examinations are conducted and the results ascertained by a committee, consisting of the Professor of the school and two other Professors. The standing of the student at these examinations is communicated to his parent or guardian in the last circular of the session. Those who attain the first division receive in public, at the close of the session, a printed certificate of their distinction at one or both of the examinations, as the case may be, and their names are mentioned in the published account of the proceedings which terminate the course. These public examinations are sufficiently comprehensive and difficult to render it impossible for the student, without steady diligence, to secure a place in the first division. III.âEXAMINATIONS FOR GRADUATION. These are partly oral and partly in writing, and are conducted by the Professor of the school, in the presence of two other Professors, forming with him the committee of examination of the school. Here the student is subjected to searching interrogations upon the details and niceties, as well as the leading principles of the subject, and he is expected to be accurately versed in all the topics treated of in the lectures and the correlative texts. As a due acquaintance with our own language is made indispensable to the attainment of even the inferior honors of the University, all candidates for degrees are subjected to an examination, in order to test their qualifications in this respect. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. DEGREES. I.âTHE ACADEMICAL DEGREES Are, first, that of Proficient in certain special departments of a school; second, that of Graduate in a school; third, that of Bachelor of Arts; and, fourth, that of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia. The degree of Proficient, conferred in a certificate of proficiency, applies only to those branches of some of the schools, which, by the regulations, the student is allowed to attend separately. These are Geology and Mineralogy, Medical Jurisprudence, Physiology, Botany, Political Economy, National Law, Constitutional Law and Government, and Anglo-Saxon. The degree of Graduate in a school embraces, in the school of Ancient Languages, the Latin and Greek Languages; in that of Modern Languages, any two of the languages taught in the school, except Anglo-Saxon; in that of Mathematics, all the studies of the school, except the Mixed Mathematics; in that of Natural Philosophy the same, omitting Geology and Mineralogy; in that of Moral Philosophy the same, omitting Political Economy. The degree of Graduate is also conferred in each of the languages separately, and in the Mixed Mathematics. None are admitted to these degrees who fail to give satisfactory evidence of their attainments at the public examinations and the examinations for graduation. II.âTHE DEGREE OF BACHELOR OF ARTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. This degree is conferred upon such students as have become graduates in all but two of the literary and scientific schools of the University, and have also obtained distinction at an intermediate and final examination of the Junior class of the two remaining schools. The candidates for this degree have moreover to satisfy the Faculty of their general literary acquirements, by furnishing an appropriate essay, composed by themselves, on CATALOGUE. some subject of literature and science, which they may be required to read on the Public Day. III.âTHE DEGREE OF MASTER OF ARTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. To merit this, the highest academical honor of the Institution, the student must have already become a graduate in all the literary and scientific schools in the University. He must, moreover, give proof of an accurate and comprehensive acquaintance with his entire course of studies, by an examination on all these subjects, in the presence of the Faculty, at the close of his academical career; and, lastly, he must prepare and submit to the Faculty an essay exhibiting a due degree of literary ability; and this he is required to read on the Public Day. IV.âTHE PROFESSIONAL DEGREES Are that of Doctor of Medicine, conferred on graduates in the Medical Department, and that of Bachelor of Laws, on graduates in the School of Law. To merit the degree of Doctor of Medicine, the student must prove by his examination that he has made satisfactory attainments in Anatomy, Surgery, Human and Comparative Physiology, Principles and Practice of Medicine, Obstetrics, Materia Medica, Botany, Chemistry, and Medical Jurisprudence. To attain the degree of Bachelor of Laws, he must in the same manner give evidence of a due acquaintance with the Law of Nature and Nations, the Science of Government, Constitutional Law, Municipal Law, including the Common Statute Law, the Principles of Equity and Commercial Law. Honorary degrees are forbidden by the laws of the University. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. THE PUBLIC DAY. On the closing day of the session, which, unless that day be Sunday, occurs on the 29th of June, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers and Students, and the Society of Alumni, assemble in the Public Hall, whither are also invited the friends of the students and the public generally. On this occasion, the results of the examinations are announced, the certificates and diplomas are awarded to the successful candidates, and addresses are delivered by the Bachelors and Masters of Arts. EXPENSES. The expenses for the session of nine months are as follows: 1. Fees.âIf one Professor be attended, $50; if two, each $30; if more than two, each $25. Every student is required to attend three schools, unless, for special reasons, leave is given to attend but one or two. In the School of Law, the fee for the Senior class in either Department is $80, with the privilege of attending all the classes in both Departments. For the Junior class in either Department the fee is $60, with the privilege of attending the Junior class in the other; but if the student attends only the class of Constitutional and International Law, and Government, the fee is $25. Medical students are charged $105 for a full course, viz: $25 for each of four tickets, and a fee of $5 for dissecting material. For the class of Anglo-Saxon in the School of Modern Languages, of Geology and Mineralogy in the School of Natural Philosophy, of Physiology in the School of Comparative Anatomy, of Botany in the School of Anatomy and Botany, and of of Medical Jurisprudence in the School of Medicine, the fee is $15 only. 2. Board and Lodgings.âBoard in any of the University hotels, $120; for which sum, diet, bedding, room furniture and attendance are furnished. Washing may be had for $9 or $12 CATALOGUE. for the session. Rent of an entire dormitory, $16; if occupied by two students, $8. The dormitories of the University are occupied by two students each; except nine, which are occupied by one student each. Fuel and candles are furnished by the Proctor at cost and five per cent. commission, and cost for each of two students, in the same dormitory, about $20. 3. Matriculation Fee, and use of Library and public rooms, $20. The expenses of the students resident in the University are limited as follows: 1. For board, the use of the dormitory, matriculation and tuition fees, the sums before stated. 2. For clothing during the session, an amount not exceeding one hundred dollars. 3. For pocket-money during the session, a sum not exceeding forty-five dollars. 4. For books and stationery, whatever the parent or guardian may think fit to allow. 5. For medicine and medical attendance, whatever may be necessary. PROHIBITION OF CREDIT. An act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students. The license to contract debts, which the Chairman is authorized to grant, is confined, (except where the parent or guardian otherwise, in writing requests,) to cases of urgent necessity; and these, it is hoped, the parents and guardians will, as far as possible, prevent from arising, by the timely supply of the requisite funds. HOTELS OR BOARDING-HOUSES. Hotels or boarding-houses are provided in the precincts of the University for the accommodation of students, and no student is permitted to board or lodge out of the precincts, unless in the family of his parent or guardian, or of some particular friend, approved by the Faculty. Except that students above the age UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. of twenty-one years may reside out of the precincts, in such boarding-houses as the Faculty may approve. The hotel-keepers are bound to maintain good order among their boarders during meals, and to report all cases of misconduct of which they have knowledge, whether occurring in their own houses or elsewhere. Additional accommodations for 150 students are in process of erection, and will probably be ready for occupation by the beginning of the session. KEEPING OF STUDENTS' FUNDS. Every student resident within the precincts is required, on matriculating, to deposit with the Patron all the money, checks, bills, drafts and other available funds, which he shall have in his possession or under his control, in any manner intended to defray his expenses while at the University, or on his return from thence to his residence. Nor shall he matriculate till he shall have deposited a sum at least sufficient to pay for the use of his dormitory and the public rooms, to pay the fees of the Professors whom he may design to attend, to pay three months' board to his hotel-keeper, to purchase the text-books and stationery which he may want at the commencement, twenty dollars on account of fuel and candles, and ten dollars to cover contingent charges and assessments against him for injuries to the buildings, &amp;c., which two last-mentioned sums are credited in the final settlement of his accounts. In like manner, he shall deposit with the Patron all the funds which he shall receive while a student of the University for the purposes aforesaid. At the end of the first three months of the session, he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the next three months; and at the expiration of the second period of three months, he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the residue of the session. Students resident out of the University are required, on matriculating, to deposit with the Patron funds sufficient to pay the fees of the Professors whom they may propose to attend, the sum charged for the use of the public rooms, and ten dollars to cover contingent charges. CATALOGUE. The fees for matriculation, room-rent and tuition are required to be paid without abatement, at whatever period of the session the student may enter; and no portion of them is refunded on account of withdrawal before the close of the session, unless the withdrawal is rendered necessary by ill-health, and occurs before the 1st of February. PRIVILEGED STUDENTS. Ministers of the Gospel and young men preparing for the ministry, bringing proper certificates from their congregations as to character and standing, may attend any of the schools of the University without payment of fees to the Professors. The Faculty, at their discretion, may allow any man of undoubted moral character, above the age of twenty-three years, to attend lectures in any of the schools of the University, and to reside out of the precincts, exempt from the rules and regulations prescribed for the government of students, except only that he shall pay the usual Professors' fees, and the usual compensation for the use of the public rooms, and shall observe all those laws of the Institution which enjoin respectful and orderly deportment. But the privilege so allowed may be withdrawn by the Faculty at any time, when, in their opinion, it has been used to the evil example of the students, or otherwise to the injury of the Institution. MONTHLY CIRCULAR. At the end of every month, a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from lectures and examinations, and any other irregularity of which he may have been guilty, together with such further information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate. The object of such report being, on the one hand, to incite the student to steady diligence, by eliciting the commendation and encouragement of his friends; and, on the other, to restrain UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. him from idleness and disorder, or to urge him to amendment by their admonition and advice; the usefulness of these circulars greatly depends upon the prompt and judicious attention they receive from those to whom they are addressed. Parents and guardians, therefore, cannot be too earnest in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly report may suggest. LIBRARY. The Library of the University, originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, has since been augmented by several valuable donations, among which the legacy of Mr. Madison, amounting to 587 volumes, that of the late Christian Bohn, Esq., a generous and enlightened citizen of Richmond, amounting to 3,380 volumes, and a donation of 234 works presented by an unknown lady through the Rev. Dr. Alexander, of Princeton. Through such additions, and the annual increase by purchase, the Library now numbers nearly 25,000 volumes, comprising an unusually large proportion of standard literary and scientific works in the principal European languages, together with a rich and extensive collection of engravings. Students are allowed the use of the books, under the usual restrictions, and the Librarian is in attendance daily at stated hours to give out books and to receive those that are returned. SOCIETY OF ALUMNI. This association is composed of such former students of the University as, having finally left the Institution, have on nomination been elected members at the annual meetings. Its objects are the promotion of letters and general education, as well as the renewal from year to year of the pleasing associations of academic life. The Society holds its meetings at the close of the session. An orator or an essayist is annually appointed by the Society from among its members, and the oration or essay is delivered in the Public Hall on the day preceding the Public Day. CATALOGUE. LITERARY SOCIETIES. There are three Literary Societies formed by the students of the University, which meet weekly at their own public rooms for the purpose of cultivating debate and composition, and hold occasionally public exhibitions. RELIGIOUS EXERCISES. Divine service is performed in the chapel every Sunday morning and evening during the session, by the Chaplain of the University, who is appointed in turn from the principal religious denominations. Students also have the opportunity of attending, at their choice, daily morning service in the chapel; and on Sundays, service at any of the churches in Charlottesville. STATE STUDENTS. To render education at the University available to meritorious young men of limited means, provision has been made for the admission of fifty students, without payment of Professors' fees or University charges. The advantage is meant to be restricted to those who are not themselves, and whose parents are not, in a situation to incur the expenses of education. Their connection with the University is to continue two years, but for extraordinary proficiency the Board of Visitors may prolong the term. They stand, in all respects, except expense, on the same footing as other students, enjoying the same privileges, and subject to the same laws. By way of remuneration to the State for the assistance thus afforded, they are required to sign an engagement to teach in some public or private school or academy within the limits of Virginia, for two years after leaving the University. The selection of students, on this foundation, is made by the Faculty on the first day of July, annually. Application for vacancies, accompanied by proper testimonials, addressed to the UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. Chairman of the Faculty, should reach the University before the 25th of June. ? Persons interested will be pleased to observe the following particulars: 1. The applicant is requested to state his age, which must be over seventeen years, and to designate the several schools of the University he may wish to enter, observing that the enactments require him, if under the age of twenty-one years, to attend at least three, unless, for good cause, the Faculty permit him to attend a less number. 2. In order to be admitted, the applicant must exhibit satisfactory testimonialsâ1st. Of irreproachable moral character. 2d. Of capacity, as well by partial cultivation as original vigor of mind, to profit by the instruction given at the University. 3d. If he desires to enter the schools of Mathematics, or of Natural Philosophy, that he possesses a familiar acquaintance with all the branches of Numerical Arithmetic, or if he desires to enter the school of Ancient Languages, that he is qualified to commence the study of the higher Latin or Greek authors; and, 4th. That neither he nor his parents are in a situation to incur the expense of his education without aid. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. VACANT DISTRICTS. The following districts will be vacant at the close of the present session: DISTRICT. IV. Powhatan, Cumberland and Chesterfield. VIII.
