      <field name="fulltext">Illustrated Edition Daily Progress Charlottesville, Va. 1906 COPYRIGHT 1906 BY ALBERT E. WALKER A 1993 facsimile published by the ALBEMARLE COUNTY HISTORICAL SOCIETY with additional notes on the original photographs</field>
      <field name="fulltext">About this Facsimile of The Daily Progress Historical and Industrial Magazine, 1906 This facsimile was produced in 1992 by the Albemarle County Historical Society, with the addition of a new appendix containing updated information on the photographs. Though most of the information in the original publication is accurate, as with nearly all works of local history, a number of mistakes can be found. Readers should keep this in mind when using this source for research purposes, and verify information using additional sources whenever possible. The Society welcomes any additional information. About the Editor of this Special Edition As proclaimed on its opening page, this Daily Progress Historical and Industrial Magazine was compiled and edited by Albert Edward Walker. Prior to arriving in Charlottesville in 1906, Walker had worked as a reporter and special writer for several New York papers, including the World, the Daily News and the Times. He eventually turned his talents to producing promotional special editions in collaboration with newspapers around the mid-Atlantic region. He traveled from city to city, combining profiles of community leaders and businesses with local history and legend to create illustrated editions which are fascinating records for local historians today. Walker was born January 10, 1868 to British parents, his father hailing from Scotland and his mother from England. According to his obituary, at the time of his birth his parents lived in Brooklyn, New York, where his father operated a line of merchant ships trading with the West Indies. He was one of seven children. Relatives remember Walker as an Englishman, however, and he maintained ties with his family across the Atlantic, making several trips to England. While in Charlottesville working on this project, Walker met and married Bessie Carroll Valentine, daughter of prominent local businessman Robert Poore Valentine. Bessie accompanied her husband on his extended visits to other communities where they lived in hotels as he pursued his unusual career. Their only child, Virginia Valentine Walker, was born in 1909. The Walkers must have considered Charlottesville their permanent home, however, for A. E. Walker invested in real estate locally and was a member of the Presbyterian Church and the Redland Club. And it was in Charlottesville, on October 8, 1918, at the home of his father-in-law on High Street, that Walker died a premature death due to Bright's disease. Mrs. Walker went on to make her own place in our local history, serving for many years as the official hostess at the University of Virginia.

      <field name="fulltext">CHARLOTTESVILLE 1762 1906 THE City of Opportunity, where welcome waits the stranger. County Seat of Albemarle. Home of the far-famed University of Virginia. "A land flowing with milk and honey." Her glorious past and future possibilities. Endowed by nature as a place of residence. A brief review of her business men whose loyalty, public spirit and sterling qualities have earned for her the proud distinction she holds in the sisterhood of cities of the great and growing Southland. Charlottesville. Oh Charlottesville! Charlottesville! Let her glories ring clear! And lilt like the kiss Of her own atmosphere! THE history and growth of cities present many varied features, the development of many being rocket-like, that of others being governed by the steady and natural progress of events in their municipal records. The rise of Charlottesville partakes of the latter characteristics. Its status to-day has not been bolstered up by sensational booms. On the contrary, indeed, its growth has been attended—in the early years, at least—by much irregularity and considerable slowness. This may really be considered an advantage, as the increase of population has assumed the elements of permanency due to legitimate and conservative courses of progress. Up to Revolutionary times our city kept wending its way slowly toward its present dimensions, maintaining its general features of a trim and thriving little town. The power by which we recall past scenes, the rapidity with which they are brought in review before us, the faculty by which we can "range o'er creation" and dwell upon the past and future, demonstrates that man was and is destined for immortality. By the contemplation of the past, we feel our span of existence extended: we enter into the thoughts, hopes and aspirations of generations gone by, and in such moments hold communion with the departed spirits of antiquity. It is not our purpose, however, to inflict the reader with an endless array of dry historical data detailing the achievements of each year. That would be as tiresome as an old ditty. Neither are we going to delve deeply or minutely into the dead past, for our citizens are essentially a people of today in all appointments and aspirations. The past is gone; the future is not here; the present must be faced as our sturdy citizens can face it, with a determination to take advantage of every opportunity to advance their own and the municipality's interests. The main object of this edition of the Progress is to advertise Charlottesville and to bring new people and new industries within our borders. We all know that every activity that provides honest employments adds not alone to the material wealth of the community, but to its moral and political life. By attaining to the highest standard of efficiency as a city government, we shall offer an incentive that will induce the settlement here of additional capital and labor. Arguing thus no single fac can be more convincing as to the superior advantages of Charlottesville as a site of industrial operation than the success and prosperity of the enterprises already in operation here. Charlottesville is the county seat of Albemarle county, and is situated in the very heart of Virginia among the foot hills of the Blue Ridge mountains. By the City Charter (1887-8) we find that the corporate limits of the city are as follows: "That so much of the land as lies and is contained within the following boundaries, beginning at the entrance to the Brennan estate from the Monticello road (the gate nearest town); thence north forty-eight, east one hundred and six poles, crossing the Chesapeake and Ohio railway, to corner of the yard belonging to (the farm) late Thomas L. Farish's estate, on the road to the Woolen Mills; thence with said yard fence, north thirty-three and one-half, east fifty-eight and one-half poles; thence north twenty-one, west one hundred and seventy-six and a half poles, to the northeast corner of B. C. Flannagan's dwelling-house; thence north seventy-two and one-half, west one hundred and fourteen poles, to the south bank of the Virginia Midland railway; thence along said southern bank, south forty-eight and one-half, west one hundred poles, and south fifty-eight and one-half, west thirty-five poles to the south side of Preston avenue; thence along the south side of said avenue, north forty-seven and one-half, west thirty-seven poles to the southeast corner of John M. White's lot; thence leaving the road or avenue, south eighty-seven and one-half, west thirty-seven and four-tenths poles, to the southeast corner of Jesse Seay's lot; thence north eighty-two and one-half, west one hundred and forty-eight poles, to the southeast corner of Mrs. Turner's slaughter-house; thence north sixty-nine and one-half, west thirty-four poles, to the lane leading to the said Mrs. Turner's house; thence with said lane, south twenty-six, west thirty poles, to the Chesapeake and Ohio railway; thence east with said railway to the crossing of the University avenue; thence leaving the railway, south thirteen and one-fourth, west one hundred and eighteen poles, crossing the Virginia Midland railway, to a corner in line with the Fife lots; thence south eighty-seven and one-half, east thirty-six poles, to the southern line of said lots, and along the same sixty-eight and one-half poles to THE HANDSOME NEW FEDERAL BUILDING. the southwest corner of Thomas B. Bunch's lot, at the head of R. H. Fife's ice-pond; thence south forty-three and one-half, east thirty-seven poles, to corner in branch below said ice-pond; thence south twenty-four and three-fourths, east one hundred and twenty-seven and one-half poles, to the southwest corner of James S. Barkdale's lot on the road to Hartman's mill; thence along the northern margin of said road, south sixty-one and three-fourths, east twenty-three and one-half poles to the southeast corner of said Barksdale's garden; thence south eighty-one, east seventy-five poles, to Pollock's branch; thence with said branch as far as its several courses will admit, north forty-two and a-half, east eighty-five poles, north seventy-four and one-half, east twenty poles, and north forty-five and one-half, east eight poles, to a point on said branch west of J. L. Hay's house; thence south sixty-nine and one-half, east one hundred and eleven and one-half poles crossing the Scottsville road (and including the said Hay's house), to the place of beginning, shall be, and is hereby made the city of Charlottesville; and the inhabitants of the city of Charlottesville, for all purposes for which towns and cities are incorporated in this Commonwealth, shall continue to be one body politic in fact and in name, under the style and denomination of the city of Charlottesville, and as such shall have all the rights, immunities, powers, and privileges, and be subject to all the duties and obligations now incumbent and pertaining to said city as a municipal corporation; and by that name may sue and be sued, and be subject to all of the provisions of the Code of Virginia, except so far as may be herein otherwise provided." Charlottesville has a population (including the University, Woolen Mills and suburbs) of 12,000, and is steadily increasing on account of the superior advantages it offers to those seeking a healthful, hospitable residential city in which to educate their children. The city has a bountiful supply of pure, free-stone water which reaches the city by gravity from an immense reservoir situated in the mountains four miles away. The sewerage system is one of the best in the South. Charlottesville is at the junction of the Chesapeake and Ohio railway, running East and West, and of the Southern railway, running North and South. More than twenty passenger trains enter the city daily, in addition to numerous fast freights and local accommodation trains. It has direct railway Communication with Washington, Baltimore, New York, Atlanta, Richmond and with deep waters at Newport News and Norfolk. The new Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Union Station are among the handsomest in Virginia. Dame Nature has been lavish in the bestowal of her charms upon our city and county. Her cloud-kissing and tempest-riven hills and her deep valleys have won for her a national fame. Other of her attractions have been told and retold in school and story books in many climes. These, great and small, are numerous, and have been fruitful themes for artists, poets and biographers, and objects of admiration for millions of others who find food for reflection in grand and awe-inspiring upheavals and contortions of nature. There are few cities in the Union that offer greater advantages to the home-seeker than Charlottesville. In climate it realizes that happy mean between the vigors of the bleak Northern winters and the torrid heat of the extreme South. In geographical location Albemarle county corresponds to that of South Europe, being between the thiry-sixth and thirty-ninth parallels of latitude. It has vast undeveloped resources. Deep in her bosom are hidden mineral treasures, which as yet remain untouched by the hand of man, while there are mighty forests of timber of original growth, where the sound of the woodman's axe has never been heard. We will dwell more fully on the resources of this vicinity in another column. Charlottesville Founded. From the history of Albemarle County published by Rev. Edgar Woods (and for which this community is greatly indebted) we find that the foundation of Charlottesville was begun "by the purchase of one thousand acres from Colonel Richard Randolph of Henrico, extending north and south from near Morris creek, and east and west from where the Chesapeake and Ohio Depot now is to Preston Heights. The title of the property was vested in Dr. Thomas Walker as trustee, and he was empowered to sell and convey it to purchasers. The town was planned at the eastern edge of this tract, and consisted of four tiers of squares, each tier running east and west, and containing seven squares, and the four tiers extending from Jefferson street on the north to south street on the south. The public square for the court house was exterior to the limits of the town. The act of Assembly establishing the town was passed in November 1762. It is therein recited that fifty acres of land contiguous to the courthouse had already been laid off into lots and streets, and as it would be of great advantage to the inhabitants of the county if established a town for the reception of traders, it was so established, to be called and known by the name of Charlottesville. Dictated by the spirit of loyalty then prevalent, the name was given in honor of Princess Charlotte of Mecklenburg Strelity, who had recently become Queen of England as the wife of King George III." Charlottesville in 1825. From an old letter the following description of Charlottesville is quoted. "The site of the village is upon the summit of a gentle elevation which begins to rise from the foot of Monticello. It contains a court house, a half finished church, and three or four taverns, which constitute the whole of its public buildings. It covers a limited portion of ground, and from its appearance, may number six hundred inhabitants. When a traveller arrives in the village, he is struck with the sublime, beautiful and picturesque scenery which everywhere surrounds him, and he pauses to contemplate with eager curiosity the magnificent prospect which meets his view. He forgets there is such a place as Charlottesville in existence when he casts his eye upon mountain after mountain rising in regular succession, and whose lofty summits mingle with the sky till they are lost in the distance. At one time the tops of these lofty hills are enveloped in clouds, and at others when the glorious King of Day sinks behind them, and tinges with golden rays their elevated heads, it calls forth an unfeigned burst of admiration. The pure, unadulterated air which descends into this village, surrounded with these mountains, gives infallable token that the best of all earthy blessings, health, dwells among them." Albemarle County. LYING in the Piedmont section of Virginia, amid the beautiful sceneries of the lofty Blue Ridge mountains is a country that needs no introduction to the world. Look at the map of the Mother State Virginia, right in the heart of this glorious land you will see Albemarle county, one of the richest and most beautiful spots in the world. This section could be nothing less than rich and healthful when nature has so abundantly provided it with natural blue grass, amid a wealth of springs and streams containing pure free stone water, no long seasons of drought, and through the warm summer days the refreshing showers never cease to refresh this thrifty land. And as the lofty Blue Ridge rises higher and higher as our Guardian Angel, it never fails to throw out its great wing to shield us from the storms and blasts that rage and roar on the other side, and sloping down toward the East with the rising sun of gold shining clear upon it, gently ends with the rolling plains of this great and beautiful section. If the stranger will look at the robust, rosy, cheeked farmer as he bustles around in his industrious energetic manner, he never has to make the inquiry as to his healthfulness, his energy and thrift, but looking around sees his answer written in the fine fruit, grains, and cattle as they like himself all abundantly thrive on the rich soil. This soil is adapted to the fruits, grains and grasses of the temperate zone. Farm machinery is used almost everywhere. In this section are to be found farmers of great wisdom and skill, who have made as much as forty-four bushels of wheat to the acre over large fields; and from fifty to seventy-five bushels of corn. Clover does well, timothy and orchard grass are also successfully used and, where time and continued grazing are given, the land runs into a blue grass sod. The finest potates are raised, and tobacco also, though not so much of the latter as in former times. Winter oats have been known to yield as much as 87 1-2 bushels to the acre on hill land. This section being the greatest fruit belt in the world and the rosy cheeked Wine Sap finds sale all over the Earth. Apples, pears, plums, peaches, quinces, cherries, bring annually hundreds of thousands of dollars. One small farmer might be mentioned who from five young cherry trees netted $150; others get from $4,000 to $5,000 for their apples in the orchard; and yet many persons looking at these orchards on hill sides and in mountain hollows, would think $5,000 a great price for the land, trees and all. The soil and climate in this section unite to give the fruit the finest color and the richest flavor. The Albemarle Pippin, which requires a special soil and elevation, has taken the first premium at the London Pomological Exhibition as the best apple in the DR. WILSON C. N. RANDOLPH, Great Grandson of Thomas Jefferson, and a resident of Charlottesville. world. It will bring from $7 to $8 a barrel in Liverpool when other American apples are selling for from $3 to $4. The first class of this kind are all exported, Strawberries, dewberries, blackberries, and raspberries, grow wild in the greatest abundance, and for months form a wholesome arcicle of diet for rich and poor. The first and last are also grown in gardens, and bring a fine price in the markets. A gentleman last season from a steep corner of his orchard where he had a patch of cultivated raspberries sold never less than one hundred quarts a day at not lower than ten cents a quart by the crate. The orchards of this section bear abundantly and are not sprayed. It is the home of the various kinds of fruits. There are many fine vineyards of table and wine grapes. The Monticello Wine Company make annually about 120,000 gallons of superior wine. The soft spring showers bring forth the golden grains of every description, wheat, corn, oats, barley and rye. Life in the heart of Virginia is really worth living, around you graze, gambol, and frolic the horses, cows and sheep on the natural blue grass of this land. Here also does the tobacco put forth its wide spreading leaves, and grows with strength and rapidity. Stock raising is one of the most remunerative employments. Sheep are protected by a dog law and easily return 1,000 per cent. They run in the fields much of the, winter needing little feed or attention. Lambs ready for the market in March will bring from $8 to $10 a head; the price falls to about $3 in June. Indeed wherever stock raising here is intelligently followed and pursued according to buisness methods, it is successful, whether the farmer raises registered stock for the breeder, or fat cattle, sheep or hogs. Amid the productions of fruit, grain, and cattle, there is no reason to sit down with them all on your hands, as the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and Southern railroads connect you with all the leading markets of the East. Richmond, Washington, Baltimore, Chicago, St. Louis and New York, which gives us the advantages of the early spring market. Charlottesville is located just 90 miles from Richmond, 115 miles from Washington, 155 miles from Baltimore and only a few hours run from Chicago, St Louis and New York. It is very readily seen that with the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio railroad running East and West and the Southern traversing North and South it would not be very difficult to locate a farm five miles distant from one or the other. Schools and churches are so closely dotted over Albemarle county that no farm is situated more than two miles from one of these, thus giving you religious and educational advantages. Far beyond the limits of the cities are the telephone poles standing as watchful sentinels and girded about from one to the other in a never-ending chain with a net work of humming wires reaching for miles and miles in the distance, right along with the Rural Free Delivery mail routes, as if in a co-partnership, adding to the farmers' joy by giving him all the city advantages. Charlottesville the county seat containing a population of 12,000, is situated at the foot of the Monticello Mountains amid the rustic scenery and grandness of which the little squrrels make their homes and the birds build there nests in the trees around the home of one of the greatest men the world ever knew whose name will be handed down and proclaimed from generation to generation, Thomas Jefferson who wrote the Declaration of American Independence. Here too, is situated the widely famed University of Virginia, a full account of which will be found in another column. A few miles west of this is the Miller Manual Labor School which educates, boards and clothes ophan children of Albemarle free of all cost. The Rawlings Institute for young ladies, a splendid school, is also located here. Charlotteville furnishes a home market for the farmer, and there has been built a cannery which greatly increases the demand for the farmers' products. Here also, is situated the Charlottesville Woolen Mills, organized in 1869, whose goods are shipped all over the United States and rank at the head of any goods of this class manufactured, the Monticello Wine Co., and the Albemarle Soapstone Co., at Alberine, who employ 800 hands. Among the other buisness enterprises of the city are: An overall factory, a bark and sumac plant, two lumber companies, electric light and gas plant, flouring mills, weekly and two daily papers, four banks, all of which have large deposits, an elegant street car service connecting us with Fry's Spring, two miles to the southwest, a noted summer resort. An Expert Opinion. Hon. S. B. Morton, from Nebraska, Secretary of Agriculture in President Cleveland's Cabinet, once said: "There is no reason on earth why Virginia should not swarm with a vigorous agricultural life. The more I think of it, the more I am impressed, and the more the wonder grows, that such a field for farming should be at the very door of an over-crowded North, and go unnoticed so long. There is not a word which I have said of the strength of the harvests which lie asleep in the soil of Virginia which over-states the truth. All it needs is energy, industry and know how, and no farms would pay better, or produce better, than the farms of Virginia, As a mere crop producer, Virginia will stand shoulder to shoulder with any State in the West." These lands, lying at the gateway of the North, in close proximity to the great markets of the United States, meeting all the requirements of Hippocrates for perfect health—pure air, pure water, and a pure soil; fertile well wooded, well watered, especially adapted to stock raising and fruit growing, with magnificent educational advantages splendid railroad facilities can be bought for from five to twenty dollars an acre, according to improvements. Here in the last few "MONTICELLO," THE HOME OF THOMAS JEFFERSON. years many from the factory towns of New England and from the great West and Northwest have come and found happy and prosperous homes. They are bringing their industry, energy and thrift to their adopted homes, and are developing the resources and building up the material wealth of Virginia, while adding to their own estates. Thomas Jefferson. THOMAS JEFFERSON, descended from a family which had been long settled in his native State, was born at Shadwell, Albemarle county, Va., on the 2d of April, 1743. After finishing his collegiate course of education at William's and Mary's College, he commenced the study of the law with the celebrated George Wythe, afterwards Chancellor of the State. He was called to the bar in 1766; and in 1769 was a member of the Legislature of Virginia. On the 12th of March, 1773, he was appointed a member of the first committee of correspondence established by the Colonial Legislatures; THOMAS JEFFERSON, THIRD PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. and the next year he wrote and published his Summary View of the Rights of British America. It was a bold and manly document, ably setting forth our own rights, and pointing out clearly the various ways in which they had been violated by the British Government. On the 27th of March, 1775, he was elected one of the members to represent Virginia in the General Congress of the Confederated Colonies, already assembled at Philadelphia, and took his seat in this assembly on the 21st of June. So early did he become known for his ability, that, in a few days after his arrival, he was made a member of a committee appointed to draw up a declaration setting forth the causes and necessity of resorting to arms. In September, 1796, when General Washington announced his determination to renounce public life, the two parties into which the nation was divided—the Federalists and Republicans—brought forward their favorite candidates. John Adams was supported by the former, and Thomas Jefferson by the latter. Mr. Adams was elected, and entered upon the duties of his office the 4th of March, 1797. Such, however were the changes in public sentiment, that after four years Mr. Jefferson was elected President. Mr. Jefferson was always greatly in favor of the emancipation of the colored brother and often spoke of the inconsistency of holding men in slavery while we ourselves were contending for liberty at the peril of everything dear, could not but strike the minds of reflecting persons. No sooner, therefore, was independence declared, than several of the States took measures gradually to put an end to slavery, by enacting laws that all children born of slaves, after a certain date, should be free when they arrived at a certain age. But the obstacles were of two kinds. First, the opposition of the slave holders themselves, and that which rendered the thing inexpedient, even with the more enlightened and benevolent, who were the sincere friends of right and emancipation, was the difficulty of disposing of them when liberated. The sentiment was almost universal, HON. JEFFERSON M. LEVY, among all classes of people in the Southern States that it would never do to emancipate the slaves, and permit them to remain in the country. The chief glory of Mr. Jefferson's character was his ardent love of liberty for all men, irrespective of color. This is clearly evinced in the preamble of the Declaration of Independence, which he wrote; in the principles of the Ordinance of 1787, which he originated; and in several passages in his Notes on Virginia, wherein he pictures, in his own nervous language, the demoralizing influences of slavery. In person Mr. Jefferson was six feet two inches high, erect and well formed, though thin; his eyes were light, and full of intelligence; his complection fair, and hiscountenance remarkably expressive. In conversation he was cheerful and enthusiastic, and his language was remarkable for vivacity and correctness. His manners were simple and unaffected, combined, however, with much native but unobtrusive dignity. Jefferson's Dying Counsel. This letter will, to you, be as one from the dead. The writer will be in the grave before you can weigh its counsels. Your affectionate and excellent father has requested that I would address to you something which might possibly have a favorable influence on the course of life you have to run; and I too, as a namesake, feel an interest in that course. Few words will be necessary, with good disposition on your part. Adore God. Reverence and cherish your parents. Love your neighbor as yourself, and your country more than yourself. Be just. Be true. Murmur not at the ways of Providence. So shall the life into which you have entered be the portal to one of eternal and ineffable bliss. And, if to the dead it is permitted to care for the things of this world, every action of your life will be under my regard. Farewell. Hon. Jefferson M. Levy.

Louisiana Purchase. Meriwether Lewis and Wm. Clark, who were appointed by Thomas Jefferson to make the Louisiana purchase from the French as decreed by Congress, June 20, 1803 were both born in the vicinity of Charlottesville Lewis Home of Meriwether Lewis at Ivy (of Lewis and Clark Expedition). was born August 18th, 1774, where the home of Mrs. Farish now stands between here and the Woolen Mills. Lewis was Jefferson's private Secretary and a Lieutenant in the United States Army. He had always been in poor health more or less, and it appears that this expedition of exploration and purchase was far too much for his weak constitution and so affected his mind that he killed himself in Western Tennessee, and by which act the world lost much valuable knowledge that he possessed. William Clark was born on what is now the old McMurdo place located about two miles Northeast from town. He was the brother of General George Rogers Clark known in history as the "Conqueror of the Northwest." A full history of these famous men is in the possession of Doctor Wilson C. N. Randolph of 202 East Jefferson street. He is a great grandson of Thomas Jefferson. Old Virginia's Hills. I have travelled o'er the mountain, I have walked upon the plain, I have heard the silvery fountain Twinkle out its sweet refrain. And though earth's full of grandeur rare, Which joy and peace instills— To me no beauty can compare With old Virginia's hills. There days are like a dream of peace, Where nature is in tune; There evening brings a sweet release Beneath the Southern moon. The soft winds whisper to the trees, There's music in the rills; There I could fall upon my knees— On old Virginia's hills. The air is like a sacred balm From mountains to the sea, Oh, let me live 'mid beauties calm That are so dear to me! And when at last I come to part From life and all its ills, Oh, may I sleep with peaceful heart Beneath Virginia's hills. Old Charlottesville. CHARLOTTESVILLE as I remember it as a child was Court House Square. I remember the old Eagle Tavern stood where the Colonial now is. It was a wooden building, with a lower and upper porch, and a bell hung at one corner of the upper porch, which sounded when meals were ready. Just in front of the tavern was Number Nothing, now occupied by Mr. Goodwin. Across the street east of the tavern was Mr. LeShort's jewelry store. He was Mr. Jefferson's jeweler and highly esteemed by him. His widow was afterwards a partner of B. C. Flannagan. Mr. LeShorts and his wife were Swiss, and the name is pronounced Leskore. Mrs. LeShorts' niece, Marion Montandon, married Maj. G. T. Jones, who sold the Cochran property to Judge S. L. Cochran, on West Main Street. Col. John R. Jones kept a dry goods store about where Edmonds and Co.'s store now is. His daughter, Mrs. Hill, is the oldest born citizen now living in Charlottesville. His son, Gen'l T. R. Jones, was a distinguished Confederate officer, and was at one time Commandant at West Point. Another son, Mr. Thomas Jones, was killed in a duel with Dr. Garnet, of Hot Springs, during the war. He was the grandfather of the Rev. J. Wm. Jones. Where the old "Young Sam Leitch House" now stands (lately sold to the Redlands Club) was the old Swan Tavern. Kenneday, in his "Horse Shoe Robertson" novel, begins by introducing two horsemen crossing Rockfish Gap, who stopped at the old Swan Tavern, Charlottesville. They are George Washington and Peter Francisco. Barrett and McIntire kept a store on the Square. Twyman Wayt was postmaster, and the postoffice was situated at the east end of what is now known as the McCue row. William Davis, who is inventor of the present Postal Car Service, late of St. Joseph, Mo., was a clerk in Mr. Wayt's office. Wash. Childs was jailor. The writer sat up with him the night before he died. His maiden sister, Miss Nancy Childs, left a house to her colored servant Margaret Childs, which was taken down to open the present entrance to the jail. Matthews, the jeweler, who has descendents in the southern part of the county, kept store in the same place as LeShort. John CHARLOTTESVILLE IN 1789. Original Drawing the Property of St. Anthony's Hall. Cochran, Sr., kept store where Rhoads and Kurtz now have their saloon, and he lived in the house now occupied by the children of Mr. R. K. Flannagan. The Farmers and Merchants Bank, Wm. A. Bibb cashier, was located THE ANCIENT COURT HOUSE, ERECTED 1803. in the brick house just north of the old post-office, and west of the present station house. The old jail was just north of the station house. John Garner, the only barber of the town, kept shop in a very small wooden building just east of Number Nothing. My old friend, Bob Cogbill, served his time under John Garner. Where the City Hall now stands, was the old-fashioned residence of David Fowler, the grandfather of my friend Whack Fowler. Where the store room recently occupied by Mr. Eldridge Turner now stands, was a house occupied by Mr. Points. In the basement of this building facing west, Mr. Perley, father of James Perley, had a furniture store. At the corner now occupied by the building in which the Wills Drug Co. has its store, stood Dodd's, furniture shop. Mr. James Perley served his time under him. Another old landmark is what was known as the Shingled Palace. It is the home now occupied by Mr. Rice Burnley as a harness store. Here was born the oldest born citizen of Charlottesville, an old colored man named Kinny, who was ninety-three years old last Christmas eve, and has been an employee of the C. &amp; O. R. R. ever since Montcure Robertson, its first president, was in office. There are several houses which are recalled by these reminiscences, but they have all been removed. The store of John and Ben Mosby, which stood about where J. D. Watson's store is now located, and Aunt Nancy Isaacs ginger bread store, which stood about where the Cable piano store now stands, were two of these. In the spot where H. Balz and Sons now keep store, my old great uncle, Tom O'Grady, kept his store, and owned about one-half of the square between 2nd and 3rd streets, E. He was one of the most original characters Charlottesville ever produced, and I hope to give some account of him later. Ebenezer Watts owned and occupied the old fashioned building which stood where the Hartnagle Building now stands. The old Tom Jones Building which stood where T. J. Wills and Co. now have their store, was for many years a landmark. Jessie Scott's house stood where the old postoffice now stands. Jessie and his boys, Bob and Jim, were the musicians of Charlottesville and Albemarle for many years. They were highly respected by all the old Albemarle families. SENEX. Old Virginia Fiddlers. AT the corner of Main and Second streets, East, where the old postoffice stood, lived the celebrated colored family of "Old Virginia fiddlers," "The Scotts." This family had some Indian blood in Site of Home of William Clark (of Lewis and Clark Expedition) near Charlottesville. The gentleman seen is Mr. E. A. Perry. them. The house was built one hundred and twenty three years ago by Colonel Bell, an officer in the Revolution and was demolished about 1895 by General Thomas L. Rosser, in order to make room for the former postoffice building. "Old Jessie" was the father, and the three boys were Tom, Bob and Jim. Tom was valet to the Hon. Wm. C. Rivers, United States Minister to Paris. He married a French woman and remained in France. The family was greatly beloved by the old citizens of the town and county. They were called upon to play at the wedding of nearly every couple in the county. Even after the war, often in the afternoon of courtdays, the old fellows would assemble at Bob Scott's house to hear the boys play the old tunes they had danced to in their young days. Jim was the best player, but Bob would put on a smoking cap with Indian bead work on it at all dances and call out the "figures." Six feet four inches high, he was a striking figure indeed. When the dance was "well on," Bob would give the "Laughing Cotillion." Instead of singing it he laughed it to violin accompaniment and the entire company, ladies and gentlemen, would join in the laugh. The effect was indescribable. I have heard Ole Bull, Vauxtemps and Remenye, and, while their playing was masterful and scientific, I had rather hear Jim Scott play "Come Share My Cottage Gentle Maiden," than any of them. Bob was the last of the "boys" to pass away. He dropped dead on Ridge street only a few years ago in his ninety-fourth year. Bob has three daughters now living in the city—Elizabeth, Mary and Charlotte, and one son, "Buck," died only a few months ago. "Naldy" Cox, the bill poster, is a grandson of Bob. Those happy old days of the Virginia fiddler have gone, and so have nearly all of the old generation who could "cut the pigeon wing,' " "back steps," and many other "steps" when "Ladies to the right" was called out by the fiddlers. S. The Post Office. THE Post Office of Charlottesville has always been managed in a business-like manner and by people who were thoroughly competent to transact its affairs to the perfect satisfaction of Uncle Sam and the inhabitants of the community. In 1876 President U. S. Grant appointed Mrs. Mary H. Sumner Long, Postmistress. She was the wife of General Amsterdell Long who was chief of artillery on the staff of General Robert E. Lee, and daughter of General E. V. Sumner of the United States Army. Mrs. Long held the position for twenty-two years and until her death. She was succeeded by Captain Thomas P. Peyton who had been connected with the postoffice for sixteen years and acted as postmaster for eight months until the appointment of Willard G. Saltsman, who gave way about one year ago to Gen. Thomas L. Rosser who was one of the leading officers in the Confederate Army. In the days of Mrs. Long the postoffice was located where Bibb's real estate office is now located. In 1895 it was moved to the corner of Main and Second streets, from where it removed, April 1, to its splendid new quarters in the Federal Building. Forty-Five Years Ago. Forty-five years ago April 12, the Confederate war was started by the South Carolinians firing on the United States troops occupying Fort Sumpter in the harbor at Charleston. A Virginian, Mr. Ruffin, was allowed to fire the first shot at the United States flag. A few days before the cadets of the South Carolina Military Academy had opened fire on the Federal ship "Star of the West" from a battery on Morris Island, near Charleston, but the shot fired at Fort Sumpter was the first official shot of the war. Census of Albemarle County and Charlottesville From 1790—1900. 1790—12,585; 1800—164,39; 1810—18, 268; 1820—32,618; 1830—19,747; 1840— 22,618; 1850—22,924; 1860—32,337; 1870 —25,800; 1880—26,625; 1890—27,556; 1900—28,473. The population of Charlottesville was for the first time taken separately from that of the county in 1870. Its numbers are as follows: 1870—2,838; 1880—2,676; 1890—5,591; 1900—6,449. The Act establishing the county of Albemarle was passed by the Legislature in September 1744. The name Albemarle was given from the title of William Anne Keppel, second Earl of Albemarle, at that time Governor General of the colony. The Old Swan Tavern. The historic old Swan Tavern was built before the Revolutionary War by John Jewett. The only person I have found who remembers the old home, is my friend Mr. R. Henry Carr, now eighty-three years of age, but who has a wonderful memory, and can off-hand give the date of birth of every king and queen of England, Johnny Yeargan, the Miser, from the original painting by the celebrated artist, John O'Toole. and the date of any historic event in American history. He says that the building was of wood, with double porches across the entire front and dormer windows, exactly in the style of the Old Eagle Tavern. The tavern had a large picture of a swan for a sign, after the style of English taverns. It is now imposible to learn the exact date of its erection, for Tarleton's Dragoons destroyed all records in the clerk's office when they made their raid on Charlottesville in 1781. From Rev. Edgar Wood's History of Albemarle, I find that John Jewett (who was probably the son of Matthew Jewett) in 1773 purchased from John Moore one hundred acres of land adjoining the town of Charlottesville on the east and north of it, and probably built the Swan Tavern at that time. In 1780 he laid out High Street, with a row of lots on both sides, and by act of the Legislature they were vested in "Trustees" to be sold at auction after giving three weeks notice in the Virginia Gazette. John Jewett kept the "Swan" until his death in 1802, and he is probably buried in the lot upon which the tavern stood. This is lot No. 58 on the town plot, and is the one on which the Levy Opera House and the Red Land club now stand. John Jewett, Jr., second son of John Jewett, Sr., succeeded his father as proprietor of the "Swan," but at what time he gave it up I have no means of ascertaining. My friend Mr. Carr, tells me it was abandoned, and when he saw it, it was in a ruinious condition. I am also told that after its abandonment a boy wandered into the house, and was horrified to find a dead body in one of the rooms, which seems to have been put there by some of the young physicians of the town for the purpose of dissection. The property was finally purchased by either James or Samuel Leitch, who erected the house now owned by the Red Land Club. John Jewett, Sr., married Mourning Harris, of Albemarle county, and a great-great aunt of Captain Micajah Woods. The youngest son, Charles, became a member of the old Door to Virtue Lodge No. 44 in 1798. "Old Jack" was the man who was at Louisa Court House when Tarleton and his dragoons, two hundred strong, passed that place on their way to Charlottesville to capture Governor Jefferson and the Virginia Legislature, which had fled from Richmond to Charlottesville. By taking a near cut, and from Tarleton's having stopped at Castle Hill for dinner, Jewett got here shortly before the British, and gave notice to the Legislature, which did not "stand on the order of going," but fled to Staunton. At Milton Jewett met a friend on horseback, and sent him to warn Mr. Jefferson. An effort was made many years ago to place a monument over Jewett's grave, but it failed of its purpose and now the spot has been lost. I shall digress at this point to put on record a fact that has never appeared in print, and which I got from a great grandson of Mr. Jefferson. When Jewett's friend arrived at Monticello and told Mr. Jefferson Tarleton was coming, he at once ordered his carriage, put his family in it, and sent them off to Blenheim, then gave orders to his two house servants, John and Caesar, to conceal his papers and valuables, and mounted his horse and went down to the blacksmith shop, which stood on the south side of the road just opposite to the gate. From there he rode up on Snead's Mountain with his "telescope," and from this elevated position looked down on Charlottesville. Seeing no red coats, he mounted his horse and started back to the shop, but before he had gone far he found that he had dropped his sword (all citizens wore dress swords in that day). He went back up the mountain, found his sword, and was about to start back, when he took one more look over the town. He not only found the streets full of red coats, but a detachment coming rapidly up the mountain. He at once rode over Carter's Mountain, then went down to Blenheim, took his family, and went to Amherst. But for dropping his sword, history would probably have been different. SENEX. Skill to do comes by doing; knowledge comes by eyes always open and working hands; and there is no knowledge that is not power.—Nannie Reed Wilson. Johnny Yeargan The Miser. ABOUT the beginning of the last century, when Charlottesville was in its youth, there came to the village from Pennsylvania a young man, evidently of German extraction, named Johnny Yeargan. Like most young fellows he was fond of ladies' society, and was a regular attendant at all the dances that took place in the town. On one occasion some one tied a dish cloth to Johnny's coat tail, which caused roars of laughter at his expense, he being unconscious of the cause of the mirth. When he discoverd the cloth at the close of the dance, he was so mortified that he became a recluse and a miser. The home he occupied was situated about where the law office of Mr. Valentine Southall now stands, just east of the Colonial Hotel. Giving up his trade, he began to sell whiskey, which he bought by the wagon load from the old "Mountain Schooners" which plied between the Valley of Virginia and the eastern part of the State. The writer has seen as many as fifty of these wagons in one convoy passing through Charlottesville. Johnny would put his whiskey away, and keep it until it improved by age, and then sell it. This made his goods the best that could be obtained in the town, and his trade grew to be quite an important one. His windows were strongly secured, and his front door was so chained that it could be opened just wide enough for a jug to be passed in and out. He only came out of his house once a year, and then to pay his taxes and license to sell. My father, who was clerk to Mr. Alexander Garret, the Clerk of Albemarle County, used to receive his taxes, and probably knew Johnny as well as any one else in the town. I cannot ascertain the exact year of his death, but he must have died about the time of my birth (1834), for I remember well that every "fourpence ha'penny," or "ninepence" that we saw that was rusty or blackened from age, was called a "Johnny Yeargan piece." One day two of Yeargan's nearest neighbors noticed that his windows had not been opened for several days, and they became alarmed for the old fellow and broke into his house and found him dead upon the floor, where he had probably been lying for some days. As his heirs were unknown and his property would revert to the State, a Mr. Southall, of Williamsburg, was appointed his executor. He came to Charlottesville, and after digging up the yard and cellar, he found $13,000 buried in the basement in pots and jars, and over the fireplace in Johnny's room a lot of "tally sticks," on which were fourteen notches. It was supposed that one thousand dollars was buried somewhere, which has never yet been found. The cellar in which the $13,000 was found was full of empty whiskey barrels, and Mr. Southall in clearing them out found one almost dropped to pieces from age, and in it about ten gallons of whiskey, which must have been from twenty-five to thirty years old. Home of Johnny Yeargan, where he was found dead, presumably murdered. The men in the picture are A. E. Walker and T. F. Richardson, representatives of The Progress. President Madison's Appeal. JAMES Madison, the fourth President of the United States was born in Orange County, Va. March 5, 1751. His home "Montpelier" still stands. He spent much time in Charlottesville and vicinity, where he was well acquainted with Jefferson and scores of others. After finishing his administration he became a member of the Board of Visitors and the Rector of the University of Virginia. Even in those early days ugly rumors of civil war were afloat and Madison while here in an eloquent appeal for the Union said in part: "I submit to you, my fellow-citizens these considerations, in full confidence that the good sense which has so often marked your decisions will allow them their due weight and effect; and that you will never suffer difficulties, however formidable in appearance, or however fashionable the error on which they may be founded, to drive you into the gloomy and perilous scenes into which the advocates for disunion would conduct you. Hearken not to the unnatural voice which tells you that the people of America, knit together as they are by so many cords of affection, can no longer live together as members of the same family; can no longer continue the mutual guardians of their mutual happiness; can no longer be fellow citizens of one great, respectable, and flourishing empire. Hearken not to the voice which petulantly tells you that the form of government recommended for your adoption is a novelty in the political world; that it has never yet had a place in the theories of the wildest projectors; that it rashly attempt what it is impossible to accomplish. No, my countrymen, shut your ears against this unhallowed language. Shut your hearts against the poison which it conveys; the kindred blood which flows in the veins of American citizens, the mingled blood which they have shed in defense of their sacred rights, consecrate their union, and excite horror at the idea of their becoming aliens, rivals, enemies. And if novelties are to be shunned, believe me, the most alarming of all novelties, the most wild of all projects, the most rash of all attempts, is that of rending us in pieces in order to preserve our liberties and promote our happiness. But why is the experiment of an extended republic to be rejected; merely because it may comprise what is new? Is it not the glory of the people of America that, whilst they have paid a decent regard to the opinions of former times and other nations, they have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity, for custom, or for names, to overrule the suggestions of their own good sense, the knowledge of their own situation, and the lessons of their own experience?" To this manly spirit posterity will be indebted for the possession, and the world for the example, of the numerous innovations displayed on the American theatre in favor of private rights and public happiness. Mosby Shoots Turpin. IN March, 1853, John S. Mosby, whose family at the time were residents of the county, shot George W. Turpin, the son of a tavern keeper (at what is now as the Cabell House) in Charlottesville, in the course of an altercation; but his adversary, though severely injured, fortunately recovered. For the offense Mosby was prosecuted. At that period Judge W. J. Robertson was Attorney for the Commonwealth and Watson and Rives defended the accused. Mosby was convicted and sentenced to pay a fine of $500 and to suffer imprisonment in the county jail for twelve months. During the term of his confinement his counsel loaned him the necessary books, and he improved his enforced leisure by devoting himself to the study of law. Two years later he was admitted as a member of the Albemarle Bar. Shortly after he removed to Abingdon, where he was practicing his profession when the Civil War broke out, in which he was destined to achieve such brilliant renown. The Old Postoffice, Corner Main and Second Streets, East. Masonic History. THE first Masonic Lodge ever organized in Charlottesville was Door to Virtue Lodge, No. 44. The first meeting was on April 24th, 1791, and the lodge was in active operation until June 2, 1801. I have given the entire membership, so that our citizens may see some of the people who lived in Charlottesville one hundred and eleven years ago. They are as follows: David Anderson, Samuel Burch, Thomas Buster, Richard Burch, Richard Buster, John Burke, Joel Bennett, Tandy Bowcock, Garland Carr, Samuel Carr, William Clarkson, Julius Clarkson, George Catlett, Marble Camden, Jesse Davenport, Thomas Divers, Archilles Douglas, Thomas Fletcher, John Gamble, Francis Gray, John M. Gilston, Alexander Garrett, Daniel Hodges, Matthew Henderson, David Isaacs, Lewis Johnson, C. Jouett, John R. Kerr, Peter Lott, Robert Lewis, Meriwether Lewis, Peter Marks, Isaac Miller, James McClanahan, Richard Price, E. A. Craven, Peyton, F. C., Richard Powell, Norman Powers, John Richardson, David Sutton, Robert Nelson, E. A., John Swope, E. A., Robert Wingfield, Tucker Woodson, Austin Wingfield, and Joseph Wingfield. Charlottesville Lodge No. 90 was in active operation from April 18th, 1812, to March 31st, 1821. I also give the entire membership of that lodge. It is as follows: Joseph Anderson, Archilles Broadhead, Charles Brown, Francis Carr, Peter Carr, Lawrence Catlett, Garland Carr, James Carr, Washington Chiles, Ira Garrett, W. W. Henning, William Huntington, John R. Jones, Williamson Kelley, David I. Lewis, Dabney Morris, Wilson Maduras, Thomas W. Maury, Samuel McAffee, Bernard Peyton, J. M. Perry, Riland Rodes, Ralph Sandridge, Garrett E. Stack, John C. Wells, and William Watson. Widow's Son Lodge, No. 60 was organized in the village of Milton, at the foot of the eastern slope of Monticello mountain, on the southern bank of the Rivanna. The first meeting ever held was on Oct. 26, Anno Lucis 5799. Those present were: Worshipful Master Edward Moore; David Burton, Senior Warden; William Clarkson, Junior Warden; Julian Clarkson, secretary, P. T.; David Burton, Senior Deacon, P. T.; John Henderson, Junior; Deacon, P. T.; Mat Henderson, John Burks, Craven Peyton, Richard Gamble, Bennett Henderson, and Geo. W. Catlett. It was ordered that the uniform of the lodge should be deep green. The lodge while in Milton met in the tavern kept by Brother Wm. D. Fitch. This old building was taken down only a few years ago. Brother Fitch came to Charlottesville to live a short time before the lodge moved from Milton, and the lodge met in the house of Brother John Watson, who probably kept the tavern after Fitch left it. The last meeting ever held in Milton was on the 13th of April, 1816. Those present were Wm. D. Gamble, A. W. Whitehurst, John H. Craven, John Fagg, Martin Dawson, John Burks, Christian Wertenbaker and John S. Amiss. The next meeting was held in Charlottesville, in the house of Branham and Jones. (The wooden house just north of and adjoining the old McKee house, on the Square.) The lodge met in this house twice only. The charter of Widow's Son Lodge No. 60 is dated Dec. 10, Anno Lucis 5799 (A. D. 1799) and was granted by the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Virginia, and signed by Benjamin Day, Most Worshipful Grand Master; Wilburn Austin and W. H. Fitzwhylson. A meeting of No. 60 was held in the house of Thomas Wells, on the 8th day of June, 1816. Another meeting was held on the 10th of August, 1816, in the house of William G. Garner. On 12th day of October, 1816, they met at the home of Brother Geo. W. Kinsolving, where they continued to meet until March 20th, 1820. On the 8th of April, 1820, it met in the Central Hotel, and continued to meet there until the 20th of March, 1821. The next place of meeting was at the house of David Fowler, the grandfather of our "Whack." The house stood where our City Hall now stands. The next meeting was in Masons Hall, but I do not know where that was as the secretary does not state in what house it was. I have always understood that the Lodge met in David Fowler's house for several years. I have also heard that they met for a while in the house at the northwest corner of Market and Third street, east. Next they met in the third story room in the "Saunders House," immediately in front of the Court House gate, then in the upper story of the Levy Opera House, and for a few meetings over Johnson and Price's Drug Store, while the present temple was undergoing reconstruction. The Temple is again being enlarged and improved, and is a fitting home for this notable old lodge. SENEX. Monticello Guard. FOR the following information regarding the Monticello Guard we are indebted to Capt. H. H. Wingfield of the Bank of Albemarle. The Monticello Guard, designated as Company "D," 70th Regiment Virginia Volunteers was formerly known as Co. A, Nineteenth Virginia Regiment, Pickett's Division, in the Confederate service. This company succeeded the Charlottesville Blues, which was a reorganization of the Jefferson Guard, organized in 1832. On May 5, 1857, P. A. Woods was elected captain and since that date the Company has been known by its present name. Capt. Woods was succeeded by Capt. Geo. Morris, and he in turn by W. Barton Mallory, under whose command the Company participated in the unveiling ceremonies of the Washington monument in Richmond Feb.22, 1858. In 1859, when John Brown, "the emancipator," had been condemned to death for leading the Harper's Ferry raid, the Monticello Guard was ordered to Charleston and was there until after his execution. Capt. Wertenbaker had charge of that part of the cordon of sentries around the town immediately in front of the JOHN BROWN From picture taken at his home in Torrington, Conn., 1857. gallows. The western sentry under Wertenbaker's command was stationed very near the gate through which Brown passed on his way to the gallows. Brown, who was sitting on his coffin, bowed to the officers as he passed. His hands were tied behind him. He was an old grey man with high forehead and strong determined mouth. His features were intellectual and not unpleasant to look upon. His lips appeared to move in prayer. On April 16, 1861 about 5 o'clock Captain Mallory received a telegram from Governor Letcher stating that the State convention had passed the ordinance of secession, which would not be promulgated until the 17th, but ordering him to proceed with his Company together with the Albemarle Rifles, Capt. R. T. W. Duke commanding, and such other men as he could collect to Harpers Ferry. In four hours from the receipt of this order, these two companies with about 150 students from the University of Virginia (commanded by Captains Hutter and Tosh) had started and were among the first troops to reach that place. Here these four companies were organized under Major Geo. W. Carr an Albemarle citizen who had served in the regular army. This battalion was called the Charlottesville and University Battalion and Lieutenant Wertenbaker of the Monticello Guard was detailed for the duty of adjutant. The men of this battalion saw service at the battles of Manassas, Williamsburg, Seven Pines, Gaines Mills, First Cold Harbor, Malvern Hill, Frazers Farm, Second Manassas, Boonsboro, Sharpsburg, Fredericksburg, Gettysburg, Brook Church Second Cold Harbor, Hatchers Run, Sailors Creek. The members of the Monticello Guard in the Civil War were Capt. Wm. B. Mallory, First Lieut, C. C. Wertenbaker, 2nd Lt., I. N. C. Stookton, 2nd Lieut. D. C. Culin, 1st. Sgt. H. F. Dade, 2nd. Sgt. R.

Soon after the return of the survivors the Guard met at the Farish House and organized as a society for the purpose of keeping the company intact. After the State was re-admitted to the Union, new members were voted into the company. Thus the Monticello Guard is the oldest continuous military organization in the State. After the passage of the military bill the society was reorganized as the Monticello Guard, with the old war Captain, Culin in command but who, shortly afterwards was succeeded by Capt. Wertenbaker who held the position until he was promoted to the Colonelcy of the Third Regiment. He was succeeded by Capt. Micajah Woods who commanded the company at the Yorktown centennial. He, in turn, was succeeded by Capts. Poindexter, Drane, James Lindsay Gordon (who was never commissioned) Thomas Spottswood Keller, and Herbert Hay Wingfield. On Apr. 21st, 1898, in response to the call of the United States government for troops for the war with Spain, this company volunteered for the service and was ordered to Richmond arriving there on May 12 1898. On May 17 the Co. was mustered into the service of the U. S. retaining its designation of `Co. D' 3d Regiment Va. Vol. Infy., and was assigned to the left of the regiment. The regiment was removed from Richmond to Camp Alger and remained there until ordered back to Richmond to be mustered out which took effect Nov. 8, 1898. Upon the muster-out, all military organizations in the State were disbanded by order of Governor Tyler; but as soon as permission was given this Co. was reorganized in the State service and Thomas Pendleton Peyton was elected Captain, John S. White, First Lieutenant; and Jno. A. Maddox, Second Lieutenant. Mr. Maddox is now First Lieutenant and T. C. Conlon, Second Lieutenant. Captain Peyton is a most efficient officer and is recognized by all as one of our leading and most progressive citizens. In recent years the company has been called out to strikes in Bluefields, Richmond and Roanoke and to a lynching in Lynchburg. To govern men you must either excel them in their accomplishments or despise them. Col. Charles C. Wertenbaker, Formerly Adjutant 19th Virginia Infantry, C. S. A., to whom we give credit for the interesting narratives "Johnny Yeargan," "Historic Taverns," Virginia Fiddlers," "Masonic History," and "Old Charlottesville," published under the nom de plume of "Senex." The New Federal Building. CHARLOTTESVILLE'S splendid government building, of which we show an excellent reproduction, (on page 8) was opened ready for occupancy April 1, 1906. It is situated on the corner of Market and North Second streets, east, the site of the old Jewish Synagogue, and just opposite the old Presbyterian church, now used as a Young Men's Christian Association. Its dimensions are 92×56 feet. It is a handsome brick structure, trimmed with marble, and is of Colonial design and harmonizes well with the new buildings at the University of Virginia. The portico is supported by six handsome columns, topped by Ionic capitals. The approaches are all of granite. There are two entrances, the main one being on Market street and the other on Second street. The driveway is on the east side of the building, leading to the mailing door. The gate to this driveway is of solid stone, the posts being ornamented with marble spheres. Another driveway, at the northwest corner, leads to the coal door. The main floor of the building contains the Postoffice. There are 489 letter boxes, two carrier delivery windows, two stamp windows and three money order and registry windows. The postoffice lobby is a thing of beauty. It is of handsome oak, finished with marble wainscoting and terraza floors. The oak finish is particularly fine, the result of excellent workmanship. The marble used for the wainscoting came from Georgia, and is known as Creole marble. The work room, money order and mailing vestibule are finished in pine. The second story contains the Courthouse, judge's room, grand jury room, clerk's room, witness room, and public and private baths. The court room is especially beautiful. It is very elaborately finished in oak and is splendidly furnished. The room is decorated with very fancy plaster cornish and panels. Admittance is through double sliding doors. The basement includes, in addition to boiler and fuel rooms and private baths, a large "swing" room—a sort of gymnasium containing lockers and in which the letter carriers may exercise, eat their lunches and make use of for general purposes. In the postoffice department are what are known as "lookouts," similar to those found in every government building. From these peep holes the employes of the department can be watched while at their work. One of these "lookouts" is in the postmaster's room and another in the general inspector's office. Others are stationed overlooking the postoffice work room and money order departments. The building is heated throughout by steam, and is lighted by both electricity and gas. It is regarded as practically fire proof. The contractors were Miles, Bradt &amp; Co., of Atlanta, Ga., a well known southern firm that has erected public buildings for "Uncle Sam" in many southern cities. The contract price of the building is $71,000. Work on the structure was begun on August 10th, 1904. The City Government. FEW fully appreciate how much the general welfare of a city depends on its government. Of course the average man has some idea as to matters generally because he is directly affected, but he knows very little as a rule, regarding detail matters. As a whole it can be truthfully said that the municipal affairs of our town have been most wisely and efficiently regulated. The transition and evolution of Charlottesville's internal improvements have been marked by a conservative management. Some of our citizens have complained in the past of unwarranted slowness on the part of the town authorities to push with more vigor measures of improvement for the public welfare, but a careful study of the subject shows that our municipal leaders have always aimed at procuring tangible and permanent results in progress, and have avoided the rash errors of costly experimental trials, which to-day compare most favorably with any town of its size in the perfect adjustment of its municipal needs and the consequent advantages accruing to the public. The following are the officers of the city: Mayor, George W. Olivier; Treasurer, Charles H. Walker; Clerk, W. G. Steele; Auditor, E. I. Corruthers; Collector, B. P. Kemper; Deputy Collector, John L. Jarman; Commissioner of Revenue, David W. Fowler; Attorney, George Perkins; Commonwealth's Attorney, A. D. Dabney; Clerk of the Corporation, Richard W. Duke; Health Officers, Dr. Robert W. Nelson and Dr. J. A. B. Sinclair; Constable, Branch E. Jefferies; Sergeant, Clifton W. Rogers; Superintendent of Gas Works, Thomas J. Williams; Superintendent of Water Works, Charles D. Carter; Superintendent of Streets and Sanitation, W. Addison Lankford; Chief of Police, Thomas A. Trice; Chief of Fire Department, Thomas J. Williams; Justice of the Peace, W. Sam Burnley; Engineer, Maj. C. M. Bolton; Superintendent of the Poor, William C. Payne, Our Schools. THE location here of the great University of Virginia has created an air of the higher education that permeates the atmosphere of Charlottesville and her environs. The sentiment of culture has been the pride of the people for many years, and when this city was referred to as "a staid old town" it was considered a compliment, and the intended sarcasm was lost. It was under this higher order of things that the present excellent public school system was inaugurated and fostered. To-day Charlottesville justly boasts of having one of the most perfect systems of public instruction in the country. It would require a great deal of space to take up the history of the school and detail the events from the beginning to the present day. Almost with the coming of the early settler came education to the section. Soon after the log cabin came the log school house with its stone chimney and high fire places. The seats and the desks were of roughly hewn logs with the old "pegleg" supporters. The schoolmaster was the typical poor-fed, long, skinny character who was paid almost wholly in keep, being cared for at different houses throughout the district. A tramp of from one to five miles to the school house was not considered a hardship in those days. The studies were limited to spelling, reading, writing and arithmetic. Goosequill pens were used, and pupils made their own ink from bark and berries. Such was the crude system of the early days of learning in this section of advanced education to-day. This city was one of the first to recognize the fact that popular education was to become a permanent factor in the educational system in the Commonwealth. Acting upon that conviction, the city schools were established and fostered and developed on lines that soon brought them in favor with the citizens of the city, and secured for them a patronage and support that manifested that the work they were doing was appeciated by every class in the community. The several School Boards charged with the management and development of the schools have been composed of men whose hearts were in the great work of giving to the people they served schools that should measure up to their needs and expectations. A thorough course of studies was adopted, wise rules prescribed for their government and competent and faithful teachers were chosen. They were not left as they were begun, but trusteesand superintendents, by careful and discriminating study of the best schools in the large cities, extended and broadened the course of studies in the Charlottesville schools by adopting the latest and most approved methods. How well they have accomplished this task is attested by the high stand taken by the pubils and graduates of MUNICIPAL BUILDING—POLICE HEADQUARTERS. the Charlottesville Public Schools in the universities and colleges attended by them after leaving the city schools. Attention should also be drawn, as further evidence of their thorough work, to the fact that many of the faithful and efficient teachers in the city public schools to-day are graduates of the Charlottesville High School, while a goodly number of others are now teaching in the county schools of Albemarle and in other counties in the State. The council has always shown a lively interest in the welfare of the schools, and has not withheld that support which has enabled the trusttees, superintendents and teachers to keep them abreast of the times in educational efficiency and progress. A feature of these thoroughly graded schools is that with a course of carefully selected studies, appropriate to the age and needs of the various schools, the grades are not overcrowded, and the teachers are concerned wholly with pupils and studies belonging to a single grade. While thorough instruction is given from text books, the work of the teachers does not stop with the mere training of the mind, but the moral THE MIDWAY SCHOOL BUILDING. training of the pupils receives daily attention, and the important question in all education, that of character-building, is never lost sight of, that those who attend these schools may not only obtain useful knowledge, but be trained in heart as well as in mind for useful and honorable citizenship. The High School course is one in which any school may feel a commendable pride and the the instruction here is so faithfully imparted by university graduates, that a pupil who has completed the precribed course of studies and earned a diploma as graduate of the Charlottesville Public Schools is fitted for life's work, and furnished with an education of which none should feel ashamed. W. T. MARTIN, President Chamber of Commerce. With such educational facilties as offers in her public schools, it is not surprising that many who are attracted to the city by its enterprise and opportunities in business and professional lines, are still further influenced by the inducements of the best educational advantages to cast their lot with the people of this progressive city. The schools are (white) Midway School (embracing primary, grammar and high school) Ridge corner of Main Street. Trustees: J. H. Lindsay, Jas. B. Wood, Phil Leterman, A. Russow, H. M. Gleason Jas. F.

PROBABLY the most important factor in the recent marked growth of this locality is the live and energetic Chamber of Commerce. The objects gained by the organization during the years of its existence, have been of great value to the welfare of the community. While the Chamber offers reasonable inducements to desirable concerns to locate here, it repels schemes needing propping on all sides. The business men, manufacturers and professional men comprising the members of this organization know the value of self help and invite competition. To the man of firm mettle, mind and principle, possessing push and industry, this locality offers unusual inducements and to set them forth is the aim of the Chamber. The objects of this organization are the advancement of the individual and general interest of the community and the encouragement of commercial enterprises. While the Chamber of Commerce has not accomplished all that some in their enthusiasm hoped, it has done all and more than the more conservative among its members expected. The organization has brought in close touch the varied interest of the city. The following officers have been chosen for the ensuing year: W. T. Martin, president; Judge George W. Morris, first vice-president; C. W. Hulfish, second vice-president; Walker Anderson, secretary; Adolph Russow, treasurer. The directors are: A. P. Bibb, A. V. Conway, J. A. Gilmore, J. E. Irvine, W. J. Keller, P. Leterman, J. M. Robertson, A. N. Adams, J. E. Wood and R. A. Watson. An Efficient Police Force. IN general the histories of new communities are much alike the world over. There are the early struggles against natural foes, the troubles of early government, the petty squabbles between small factions, and the intense loyalty to the new home. There is always the stage through which every settlement has to pass when there is no need for what is now termed "police regulations." A few families living together in a every small settlement have no need of officers to conserve the peace. There is no disturbance of the peace among themselves, and they unite in warding off the invaders that would bring discord among them. Circumstances always determine the length of time during which this condition exists. Then comes the times when the first trouble arises. That is usually settled without difficulty by those who are not involved in the disagreement. But before long, after new settlers have been admitted to the community, and diversified interests have arisen, there comes the time when some form of goverment has to be established. An officer has to be appointed or elected to preserve the peace. It is a momentous time in any community but comes about naturally under any goverment and any form of goverment. The police department of Charlottesville has many merits, and is worthy of a more extended consideration than we have space to give it here. No pains have been spared to elevate it to the highest standard of thoroughness and efficiency, and that these efforts have met with entire success is easily verified. As to the early history of the force we have not the facts and figures on our desk and have not the time to hunt them up at the present moment. The police of our city to-day is a fine, worthy and handsome body of men, every one of whom is both a credit to himself and the department. The force at the present day is composed of T. A. Trice, the worthy chief, who has been connected with the department for twelve years, and three years ago was appointed to his present position. He is a native of Louisa County and came to Albemarle in 1867 and took up farming. At the latter part of the Civil War be served in the Confederate Army as a member of the First Virginia Light Artillery. He stands six feet three in. and weighs 250 lbs. The other members are E. N. Eubank, O. M. Wood, D. C. Grady, Z. L. Dameron, J. C. Marsh, W. J. Davis, E. E. Stratton and S. E. Lushbaugh. All in all they are a handsome body of men of which Charlottesville is justly proud. The Fire Department. OUR people are justly proud of Charlottesville's fire fighters and well they should be for there are but few towns the size of this who have a better or more up-to-date fire department. It has long held a record for alertness, activity and readiness. Its worthy achievements have been many and for the "boys" too much praise cannot be given. Its members have ever been found ready and wiling at any hour of the day or night, rain or shine, frost or snow to risk their lives and health when duty called NEW HOME OF THE ELKS. them. The Charlottesville fire department is a volunteer one, only two men in it are paid, namely W. L. Payne the house foreman, whe drives the steamer and acts as its engineer and Wilber Thomas, driver of the hook and ladder truck. The officers of the department are T. J. Williams, chief, J. E. Kelly 1st Warden, H. E. Hall, 2nd Warden, J. C, Clarity 3rd Warden, D. W. Fowler, Commander; E. A. Balz, Secretary; James Bryant, Treasurer; Dr. C. W. Poindexter, Fire Marshall. The department was reorganized July 28, 1885. All the officers are elected in August of each year and hold office for one year, or until then successors are elected. In August 1905 the fine new engine (No. 1) was added, and was a great improvement, for prior to that the only water power to be had was from the hydrants. The organization are members of the Virginia State Firemans Association. The active members are: E. A. Balz, J. M. Cochran, G. W. Chrisman, Archie Dabney, P. M. Fitch, E. V. Higginbotham, A. Haden, W. A. Irving, Rives Jones, J. L. Morrow, A. L. Marshall, John McLeod, C. C. Payne, P. F. Payne, F. Payne, A. D. Payne, J. V. Perley, J. F. Philips, Eldridge Turner, W. H. Watson, J. C. Matthews, Chas. King, H. Eddins. Within a few months the department will be in their handsome new headquarters on Vinegar Hill. It will be one of the best equipped and most up-to-date of its kind in the Old Dominion. Ye Order of Elks. Charlottesville Lodge No. 389 B. P. O. Elks was organized here October 1897 and is one of the most prosperous of this popular fraternal organization. From the day of its inauguration up to the present time its career has been one of unbounded success. The splendid new home that it has just erected at a cost of $20,000 speaks more for the healthfulness of the order than any words that we might pen in its praise. The building is of old English colonial architecture with four huge columns in front. Its interior is beautifully decorated and is divided into lodge-room, parlors, library, card-room, bowling alley, banquet hall, pool and billiard parlors, hot and cold baths, buffet etc. The Exalted Rulers have been James B. Wood, Moses Leterman, J. W. Fishburn, W. H. Wood, H. M. Lewis, G. B. Goodyear, Stuart Hanckel, T. C. Conlon, B. W. Leterman and Joel M. Cochran who with the following constitute the present officers of the lodge. Esteemed Leading Knight—G. Burnley Sinclair. Esteemed Loyal Knight—Harmon Dinwiddie. Esteemed Lecturing Knight —Ed. A. Joachim. Treasurer—George E. Walker. Secretary—Charles E. Jones. Trustees—Phil Leterman, Fred W. Twyman and Sol. Kaufman. Board of Governors of New Home—T. C. Conlon, Sol. Kaufman, B. W. Leterman, J. E. Early and J. P. Michie. The membership today is 175, among whom are many of our most influential citizens and noted bloods of the blood royal.

IN 1864, as a retaliation and to prevent the further execution of his men by Custer, and ravaging and burning in the Valley of Virginia, contrary to the laws of war, Colonel John S. Mosby determined to hang a certain number of Northen prisoners, to be chosen by lot from a body captured by his command, "The hanging of these men was so distressing," said Colonel Mosby in a recent interview here with Mr. W. Sam Burnley, "that I had them taken about a mile from my headquarters before the lots were drawn. Among those to whom the lot fell to be hung was a drummer boy, a lad of tender years, upon being apprised of which, I immediately ordered that he be not executed, and shortly afterwards succeeded in having him exchanged and sent home. I shall never forget the gratitude of that boy." "I have here," the Colonel added, holding up a handsome cane, "a memento of that occurrence which I prize very highly, and which was presented to me but a short time ago by the man who was at that time the drummer boy I spared." A handsomely engraved silver plate fastened to the body of the cane, to the front and below the handle, bears the following inscription; "To Col. John S. Mosby, with profoundest regard of James A. Daly, (the Drummer Boy) near Newtown, Va., Nov. 4th, 1864. Th Daily Progress. THERE are at the present time two daily newspapers in Charlottesville to note from day to day the "passing tidings of the times." There have been others from time to time but, alas, all of them have suffocated in "printer's ink," and have been sepulchered with untimely births that wailed feebly for public sustentation, and passed into oblivion without substance enough to even shadow one a ghost. The Daily Progress commenced publication Sept 15, 1892, and from that time on its career has been on and upward, until to-day it is recogonized by readers and advertisers alike as one of the very best newspapers published in Virginia. From the time of its inception a well-defined purpose has marked the course of success unparalled among the journals of the State. With the history of The Progress the entire reading public is familiar. All of its achievements are milestones in the march of progress which can not be forgotten and need not be recalled. It has told the truth at all times of all happenings, adhering strictly, even in the heat of partisan strife and despite its own opinions, to the belief that, in the presentation of the news, the sole duty of a public journal is to record events timely and truthfully. The Progress is published every evening except Sunday with J. H. Lindsay holding down the editor's and publisher's chair. Nearly every resident of Charlottesville and Albemarle county reads the Progress, and its circulation is extending and spreading in every direction. The Progress is known wherever Charlottesville is known. It has been carried to the uttermost limits of the Republic; it has been borne by our conquering regiments into the jungles of the Philippines; it was at the memorable battle of San Juan, and found its way over the walls of the sacred cites of the Celestial Kingdom. As our citizens gather up their household goods to push their fortunes in other regions, they fail not to have follow them the paper which is so closely identified with their old home, and so thorough a reflex of its life May the future success of. The Progress be as bright and prosperous as has been the past, and may it meet with that hearty support from our citizens which such a paper is justly entitled to receive. Its splendid printing house located on Fifth street was erected in 1896. In 1905 a new two-story extension was added and now the premises have a floor space of 32,000 square feet. The plant is equipped with all the very latest and most improved machinery and is one of the very best newspaper publishing establishments in central Virginia. When the paper began business it bought in the old Weekly Chronicle (which it still publishes), and Jeffersonian Republican, established 1835. Mr. B. Lee Hawkins is the City Editor, Col. L. S. Marye Chief of the Editorial Staff and Mrs. Wilson Howe looks after the social end. It has a large staff of reporters. THE EDUCATION ASSOCIATION. THE Charlottesville Education Assocation was organized Mar. 9, 1906, at the Midway School building, the following officers being elected for the ensuing year: Hon. J. W. Fishburne, president. Mrs. C. H. Walker, first vice-president, Mrs. A. H. Tuttle, second vice-president, Dr. E. Reinhold Rogers, third vice-president, Mr. Bruce R. Payne, secretary, Captain Thomas P. Peyton, treasurer. The educational league has a wide scope of operation. First and foremost is the improvement of conditions surrounding public schools and the beautification of the city. The league will acquire a library and will exert its influence along with that of the Civic Improvement League, and while not usurping the office of any official or officials, it will use its endeavors to make, as the president in his remarks stated, "An education center of Charlottesville, and improve the general appearance of the city." This Association is one of the subsidiary educational associations recommended by the "Cooperative Educational Association of Virginia." an organization that covers the entire State.

TO the public in general this edition of The Daily Progress is presented with our cordial good wishes and appreciation for their kind co-operation. It is issued after many weeks of tireless energy, great expense and difficulties, and will, we think, compare favorably with any similar work ever undertaken here. No one but those actively engaged in its construction can appreciate the extent of the work required to bring it to its present state. We have taken every care possible to make the edition as perfect and complete as our space would allow. Only a very few of our citizens failed to enter into the spirit of our enterprise, which takes in everything from the largest manufacturing concerns to the smallest business, and shows at a glance, the wonderful progress and activity going on in and about this modern Garden of Eden. We trust that the far-reaching publicity given to the write-ups of these wide-a-wake concerns will redound to their credit and incidentally to that of our beautiful city and county. We believe that thousands of copies of this issue of The Progress will be preserved as souvenirs to show those who follow what Charlottesville was and looked like in the year of grace 1906. The selections we have made will show at least how rich an heritage we have bequeathed. CHARLOTTESVILLE from the standpoint of religion is represented by almost every shade of Christian belief. A broad spirit of toleration exists, and our citizens dwell harmoniously in brotherly love and good will. The noble edifices reared by different denominations are beautiful specimens of architecture, adding greatly to the picturesque features of the town. We herewith present a detailed list of the churches belonging to the various denominations: The churches are, Baptist,—the First, Fife's Memorial Chapel, Rose Hill Chapel, High Street; the Christian, Christ Episcopal, Belmont Methodist Episcopal, Charlottesville Methodist, the Presbyterian, the Catholic Church of the Holy Paraclete, the Jewish Beth Israel, and the undenomination Union Mission. The churches for the colored people are five - Ebenezer, First Baptist, Mt. Zion, Shiloh, Zion Union, and the John Wesley Methodist. Let us have faith that right makes might, and in the faith let us dare to do our duty as we understand it.— Lincoln. THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. THE University of Virginia holds a place of its own in educational history; it was our first real university; its achievements in the field of scholarship and its service to public life have been manifold, and have not yet had adequate recognition. It was the creation of one of the most fertile and original statesmen we have yet produced; three Presidents or ex-Presidents sat on its first Board of Visitors; it is associated with one of the foremost American men of letters, and with a long line of cultivated, scholarly, and distinguished men in public and professional life; it is the most democratic of American colleges in its organization; it is genuinely and typically representative of a generous and high-spirited people, who have never parted with their idealism, and among whom the traditions of courage, courtesy, and hospitality are still sacred. The foundation for the University was laid in 1803, when the Legislature of the State by an act incorporated certain leading citizens of Albemarle county under the style of "Trustees of Albemarle Academy," and were empowered to take the necessary steps for the purpose of raising funds required for erecting buildings and putting the Academy into operation. Little or no headway was made however, and it was not until March, 1814, when Thomas Jefferson, the real head and founder, was elected to the Board of Trustees that a process of development was begun which eventually led to the erection of the University. In August of that year the committee to select a site reported that it would be desirable to locate the Academy near Charlottesville, but no further action was taken until 1816, when the Legislature authorized the establishment of "Central Academy" in Albemarle county "on the site selected by the Trustees." "In May, 1817," writes Professor Wm. Harrison Faulkner, "Jefferson was elected Rector of the Board, and on October 6th of the same year, in the presence of Thomas Jefferson, Rector, and of James Madison and James Monroe— the latter then President of the United States—the corner-stone of Central College was laid. The site of the new college was a farm of some two hundred acres, one mile west of Charlottesville, purchased shortly after Jefferson's election as Rector, and now forming a part of the grounds of the University of Virginia. The building at whose foundation were present a President and two ex-Presidents of the United States, is now one of the pavilions on the west lawn of the University, and has been for many years the residence of Dr. Noah K. Davis, Professor of Moral Philosophy. It was erected from plans drawn by Jefferson himself, and formed a part of the large architectural scheme afterwards carried out in detail, when EAST LAWN Central College was merged into the University of Virginia. As Rector of Central College, Jefferson's prime object was to get that institution well under way and have it adopted as the State University. From the beginning there had been in the Legislature a strong opposition to his plan of forming a State University; this opposition, however, was finally overcome through the determined efforts of Joseph Carrington Cabell, Jefferson's close personal friend and fellow-member of the Board of Visitors, and in February, 1818, the Legislature authorized the appointment by the Governor of a "Board of Commissioners for the University," to consist of twenty-four members. This board met at the Rockfish Gap Tavern in the Blue Ridge Mountains, August the 1st, 1818. Jefferson, Madison and Monroe were present at the meeting, and Jefferson presented a report, probably written before the meeting, recommending among other things, Central College as the most advantageous site for the State University. This report, adopted by the Commissioners, and at once forwarded to the Speaker of the Senate and the Speaker of the House, formed the basis of an act to establish a State University, introduced into the Legislature the following January. The opposition to this measure was as determined as that of 1818, but Cabell's efforts and influence again prevailed, and on January 15, 1819, the Legislature passed a formal act, "for establishing SOUTH FRONT OF THE ROTUNDA. a University." This day marks the beginning of the University of Virginia, though the institution was not open to students until March 7, 1825. The supreme government of the University was vested in a board of six visitors (afterwards increased to eight), appointed by the Governor. This board consisted of four members of the old board of Central College— Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Joseph Carrington Cabell and John H. Cocke—and three additional appointees, James Breckenridge, Chapman Johnson and Robert Taylor. At the first meeting of the board, March 29, 1819, Mr. Jefferson was elected Rector, and from that time until his death, in 1826, he directed and dominated the University, "not only evolving the entire system of education introduced, but actually devising, to the minutest details, every feature of construction and organization." As originally organized the University of Virginia consisted of eight independent schools— Ancient Languages, Modern Languages, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Medicine and Law. One of the excellent qualities of this system was its elasticity; a new realm of knowledge opened by the advance of thought, could be admitted to academic statehood with as much ease as a new State is admitted to the Union; each domain, as it extended its boundaries, could be subdivided and new schools arise; and yet the original conception of an academical Edwin Anderson Alderman, LL. D., First President of the University. union remained unchanged. Hence the internal history of the University of Virginia is one of constant addition and expansion, until, at present, the Schools number twenty-six, grouped under six different departments. This grouping of the various schools into departments began in 1837, when the school of Medicine was elevated to the Department of Medicine; in 1850, the School of Law was enlarged into a department, while in subsequent years, as the industrial development of the South made such a step necessary, were added the Departments of Engineering and the Department of Agriculture. The academic work of the University is grouped under two departments—The College and the Department of Graduate Studies. The latest, and in many respects, the most important addition to the number of academic schools, since the foundation of the University, is the Curry Memorial School of Education, made possible soon after President Alderman's installation, by the generous gift of Mr. John D. Rockefeller. The history of the University of Virginia is one of steady growth and development. That this growth is destined, under President Alderman, to continue and to be even more remarkable than it has been for the past two years, is the conviction of all those who study educational conditions in the South. Already the number of students is larger than in any previous year of the University's existence, and the faculty has been increased and greatly strengthened. More promising and more important still than this growth in the University itself, is the inspiration which the whole public educational system of Virginia is drawing from it. Truly the perfect fruition of Thomas Jefferson's educational system, from the primary school to the State University, seems close at hand. Dr. Edwin Anderson Alderman, the first President of the University, was graduated at the University of North Carolina in 1882, Ph. B.: Superintendent of Schools, Goldsboro, N. C., and Assistant Superintendent of Education, North Carolina, 1889-92; Professor of History, State Normal and Industrial College, 1892-93; Professor of Education, University of North Carolina, 1893-96; President University of North Carolina, 1896-1900; President Tulane University of Louisiana, 1900-1904; President University of Virginia, 1904—L. L. D., University of the South, Sewanee, 1896; L. L. D., Tulane University, 1899; L. L. D., John's Hopkins University, 1902; L. L. D., Columbia University 1905; L. L. D., Yale University 1905; Member of Southern Education Board, Vice-President National Education Association, 1903; Phi Beta Kappa, 1905; Member of Maryland and Louisiana Historical Society; Phi Kappa Sigma Fraternity; Author of a brief "History of North Carolina" and "Life of William Hooper," "Life of J. L. N. Curry;" "Obligations and Opportunities of Citizenship," "Southern Idealism," etc. Dr. Alderman was born in Wilmington, North Carolina, in the Spring of 1861. He was born a Democrat in a city where a man's politics and his religion are as unchangeable as the laws of the Medes and Persians. He is an excellent gentleman and has been proposed by the Hartford Courant and Harper's Weekly as a suitable man for the Democrats to nominate for President of the United States in 1908. Any further information pertaining to the University will be cheerfully furnished by Mr. R. M. Price, the secretary, who will be found a most obliging and pleasing officer. Young Men's Christian Association. The effort to establish a Young Men's Christian Association in Charlottesville had its inception as far back as 1871. It had its beginning in the shape of a Y. M. C. A. with rooms in the lower part of Main street. Some of our best and most honored citizens were members of this Association and worked hard for its maintenance. But after a few years of successful effort there was a lull. This did not last long however for in 1887 the work opened up again with new vigor. Mr. R. P. Valentine was president of the Association, and associated with him in official capacity were the following well known gentlemen: Vice-Presidents; Dr. John Thornley, J. C. Mathews, H. M. Gleason, A. C. Brechin, S. V. Southall; T. T. Wood, treasurer; Thos. P. Peyton, corresponing secretary; N. H. Wranek, librarian; J. McLain Brown, general secretary. Ex-committee; George Perkins, Dr. A. T. Nelson, M. C. Thomas. During the next three years from 1887 to 1890 the effort was very successful. Following are some features of the work at this time; a well equipped reading room, a library of some 400 volumes, evening educational classes, a literary society, lectures, a boarding house register, a free employment bureau, social and religious meetings. Again there was a lull and in 1890 the effort took shape in a Men's Reading Room and Library Association. This was maintained until a year ago when Building of the Young Men's Christian Association. it was re-organized into the present Young Men's Christian Association. The present organization is the result of a steady and determined forging ahead to a position of permanent location, effort and opportunity, in a location which is considered by many to be the best to be had for the purpose. The structure owned and occupied by the Association is the old Presbyterian church building at the corner of Market and Second streets east, directly opposite the new Government Building. It was purchased at a cost of $3,000 and has been remodeled painted and equipped at an additional cost of $800. The officers of the Association are W. T. Martin, president; J. A. Gilmore, vice-president; R. S. J. Sterling, treasurer; C. W. Hulfish, recording secretary. Directors: Dr. C. S. Venable, Dr. H. S. Hedges, L. W. Graves, G. T. Spitzer, R. S. J. Sterling, J. A. Gilmore, H. L. Lyman, C. H. Walker, C. W. Hulfish, W. T. Martin, Dr. C. W. Kent, J. E. Irvine, B. F. Dickerson, H. M. Gleason, J. N. Waddell. General Secretary, H. C. Ballou. All are good conservative business men who believe in the welfare of young men and who are willing to sacrifice their time and energy to help them. The object of the Young Men's Christian Association is to place within easy reach of all men (but more especially the young men who are disposed to make use of any or all such facilities) "an up-to-date, attractive, inviting, comfortable reading room," well supplied with daily, weekly, and monthly journals and periodicals. A useful library of readable books, a full complement of useful fixtures and fittings for a safe, sound and wholesome "physical culture" course; a clean and attractive outfit for toilet, lavatory, and spray or shower baths; a good audience room for musicals, sociables, drills, athletic games or meets; and all under the leadership of a competent and trained athlete and leader, in the person of a secretary, whose sole business is to attend to and look after, all the interests of the Association:—its building, appointments, members, visitors; and to take entire supervision of all the affairs of the organization, with a president and board of trustees to counsel and assist him in all essential particulars. Its ideal has always been the highest and truest development of young men. Its doors are open to every young man who has an ambition in life and whose purpose is to attain it. The enjoyment of membership privileges is not conditional on nationality, occupation or religious belief. Character is the only test. The theory of the Association is to help young men to help themselves. It is possible to furnish so many privileges at such nominal cost to young men through the generosity of the leading citizens of Charlottesville who annually subscribe to the current expenses. The plans for the coming season (1906-7) contemplate a much larger and more valuable work in the educational, physical, social and religious departments. The inducements held out to young men this year are by far the greatest in the history of the Charlottesville Association. The Association meets the needs in the lives of young men as does no other institution because it provides for every legitimate phase of his physicial, mental and moral nature, and its doors are open from 9 a. m. to 10 p. m. every week day and part of the Sabbath. Christ Protestant Episcopal Church as it will appear when Completed. Christ Episcopal Church. The accompanying cut of the Episcocopal Church known as Christ Church, is what the building will be when the towers are completed. It stands on the corner of High and North Second streets west. It is built of Richmond granite. The main Auditorium has a seating capacity of seven hundred. In the rear is the Sunday-school room, and various other rooms, where the many societies hold their meetings, of which there are a goodly number connected with the Parish. The building replaces a quaint old structure, which was taken down in August, 1895. The plans for the old Christ Church were drawn by Mr. Jefferson, who, as the late Bishop Meade says, "appears to have been an active vestryman for many years." The Rev. Frederick Hatch became rector of the Parish in 1820, of whom, and of the church Bishop Meade writes, "To the zeal and enterprise of the Rev. Mr. Hatch is, under God, to be ascribed the building of the church in Charlottesville, which stands just within the limits of Fredericksville Parish. For a long time the courthouse was the only place in Charlottesville or round about for public worship. The four leading denominations in the State equally divided the Sabbaths and some thought this was sufficient, and calculated to promote peace and love among all. Mr. Jefferson used to bring his seat with him on horseback from Monticello, it being some light contrivance, which, folded up, was carried under his arm, and unfolded, served for a chair on the floor of the courthouse. But the great body of the people felt the need of a more convenient place of worship, where more persons could be accommodated, and in better manner. It was proposed that all denominations should unite in one, but was found full of difficulties and abandoned. It was proposed that two should unite—the Episcopalians and Presbyterians—which came to nothing. Mr. Hatch, who was opposed to either scheme, then circulated a subscription for an Episcopal church, which immediately succeeded, and was soon folfowed with the same success by all the others. The Rev. Mr. Hatch, was succeeded by the Rev. Zachariah Mead, who was followed by the Rev. Mr. Cobbs, afterwards Bishop. In 1845 the Rev. Richard K. Meade was ordained to the ministry, and soon afterward took charge of Christ Church. He continued the Rector until 1868, when he was succeeded by the Rev. J. S. Hanckel, D. D. The Rev. Mr. Meade's first official act seems, from the records, to have been the conducting of the funeral service of Mr. Peche Gilmer, who died April 7th, 1836. The Rev. Dr. Hanckel continued in charge until his death, which occurred Aug. 22, 1892. During a portion of Dr. Hanckel's rectorship, the Rev. Robb White, was Associate Rector. Mr. White accepting the rectorship of Christ Church, Savannah, in the fall of 1889, the Rev. H. B. Lee, became Dr. Hanckel's assistant, Feb. 1, 1890. In September, following the death of Dr. Hanckel, Mr. Lee was elected rector, and now holds that position. The present Vestry consists of the following: Dr. R. W. Nelson, sr. warden; Hon. George W. Olivier, jr. warden; Mr. C. H. Marchant, secretary; Judge John M. White, treasurer; Hon. Louis T. Hanckel, Capt. Micajah Woods, Maj. C. M. Bolton, Capt. H. C. Michie, Dr. J. S. Davis, Prof. Ormond Stone, Mr. H. L. Lyman, Mr. John T. Antrim. There are four hundred and fifty communicants in this congregation. First Baptist Church. The Church now known as the First Baptist Church of Charlottesville was organized on the 18 of August, 1831, with a membership of twelve males and nineteen females. Dr. Harden Massie the first clerk of the Church a position which has since been occupied by a number of excellent men among them were A. Pope Abell, J. W. Doplin, M. C. Thomas S. A. Eddins and the present incubent E. A. Peyton. It has numbered among its pastors some of the most famous men of the denomination. Conspicuous among these were the illustrious John A. Broadus, and his famous uncle William F. Broadus, A. B. Brown, John C. Long, and in later days, William Harrison Williams afterwards the well know editor of the Central Baptist of St. Louis, Kerr B. Tuppet now one of the prominent men of the denomination and pastor of one of the leading New York churches, Dr. H. W. Tribble now pastor of the High Street Baptist Church of this city and President of Rawlings Institute. The present pastor the Rev. John B. Turpin is now in the sixth year of his second pastorate. He was recalled to the Church in the fall 1900. The Church has built several houses of worship. One soon after its organization which it out grew in the course of less than twenty years, another in the early fifties and the present exceptionally FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH. handsome and imposing edifice which has been universally admired for its beauty and other more important features. This building was dedicated last July. Its present Deacons are M. C. Thomas, Chairman of the Board, T. W. Bailey, B. F. Dickerson, Dr. R. K. Flannagan, J. W. Lane, J. C. Mathews, W. N. Wood. The membership of the church has greatly grown of late years and it is now the fourth largest Baptist Church in the State. The Christian Church. The organization of the present Christian Church of this city dates back to the year 1835. During this year and that of 1836 about half of the membership of the local Baptist church with the paster, R. L. Coleman, also James Goss, (with one or two other preachers,) formed themselves into what was known as a church of Christ. The new organization stood for Bible names and the Bible as the only rule of faith and practice. The greatest exponent of the new line thought which was extending eastward and westward and which took the name of the Reformation was Alexander Campbell. For this reason those holding like views with the reformer were termed "Campbellites," though they repudiated the appellation. The first meeting place of the local church was in the courthouse. Every week they came together to broke bread even before a pastor was secured for full time. The Lord's Supper is still observed each Lord's Day. In 1836 the present lowas secured and in 1837 the first build ing was erected. This structure stood until 1897, when it was replaced by a handsome modern edifice. The present membership is about 260. Among those who have served the church as pastors are: R. L. Coleman, A. N. McChesney, A. B. Walthall, L. A. Cutler, C. S. Lucas, J. H. Carter, F. D. Power, Junius Wilkins, E. L. Powell, S. F. Fowler; H. J. Seamon, M. Pittman, B. A. Abbott, B. P. Smith, and the present pastor, C. R. Sine, who was called to the work July, 1904. Among the many prominent men who have visited the church since its organization are the names of: Alexander Campbell, (who gave a series of sermons in 1840 and delivered a lecture at that time before the local Lyceum,) Isaac Errett, D. S. Burnett, W. H. Hobson, C. S. Loos and J. W. McGarvey. The following list includes its present officers: Pastor and President of the Board, C. R. Sine, 415 North First street. Elders: J. C.

From that year to the year 1820, there seems to have been no church building in the town, though there was occasional preaching. About 1820 a union church was built where all denominations worshiped. The first Presbyterian church building was erected in 1827 on the southeast corner of Market and Second streets. This building was replaced by a better structure in the same lot in the year 1856. The third building, which is the present church edifice, was erected in 1898. The corner stone was laid June 24, 1897, and the building was dedicated May 15, 1898. It occupies the southwest corner of Market and Second streets. It is a very handsome structure, a credit to the enterprising spirit of the church, and an ornament to the city. The cost of the lot, building and furnishings was about $36,000. The church seats 720 persons, and has an expansion in its Sunday-school room, which increases the seating capacity to 1200. On the occasion of its dedication there were 1200 persons present in sight and hearing of the speaker. The church room is a perfect auditorium, the acoustics being without fault. A handsome organ, built by Stein of Baltimore, was placed in the church in 1902 at a cost of $3,000. The old pipe organ was placed in the Sunday-school room where its sweet tones are still heard. The new church is furnished with all modern church conveniences; and is most complete. The first organized Presbyterian church in Charlottesville was called "South Plains" church. It included three preaching places: Charlottesville, Keswick and Bethel. But it was one organization, governed by one session. This organization was effected in 1819. In the year 1840 Charlottesville Presbyterianism claimed a separate organization, which was designated "The First Presbyterian Church of Charlottesville." The other two places of preaching retained the old name: South Plains church. In 1870 Bethel was set off into a separate church, and Keswick retained and still retains the original name South Plains church. The following ministers have been identified with the Charlottesville Presbyterian church as pastors or supplies in some period of its history: B. H. Rice, J. C. Wilson, W. J. Armstrong, F. Bowman, W. S. White, D. B. Ewing, B. M. Wailes, J. H. Smith, J. E. Annan, W. J. Hoge, W. H. McGuffey, E. Woods, J. H. Bryson, R. L. Dabney and G. L. Petrie. The present pastorate is the longest in the history of the church, having now extended over 28 years. The membership of the Charlottesville Presbyterian church today is about 500. This number includes many distinguished names of persons in the various circles of life and influence in the city, lawyers, physicians, and business men of Charlottesville, and eminent professors in the University. The church is thoroughly organized in the various departments of christian work, including Sunday-school and societies. It is liberal in its contributions to benevolent causes, and progressive in its spirit and work. A cordial greeting is extended to all visitors and strangers who worship in this church. It is the earnest desire of the Presbyterians of Charlottesville to make their church a church of the people where all are welcome and all are invited to feel at home. It endeavors to stand for what is true, right and pure in life and methods, and to justify its existence by its contribution to the well being of the city. The Methodist Episcopal Church. The first Methodist church in Charlottesville was originally a small brick structure, built on the site now occupied partly by the parsonage, and had a seating capacity of 350, including the gallery in the rear end. The pulpit was very high. The church was dedicated in 1835 by Bishop Emory. At the Conference of 1835 Rev. Edward Wadsworth was appointed pastor to Charlottesville and Scottsville, with one church, Temple Hill, between. He alternated the Sabbaths between the two towns and preached at Temple Hill during the week. Wadsworth was a young man of great ability. In 1837 Charlottesville was made an independent station. In the early days of the Charlottesville church many of the University students took an active part in the church work and Sunday-school. Some of them were teachers, superintendents, etc. Don Peters, uncle of Col. William E. Peters, was one of the Sunday-school teachers. Dr. Gessner Harrison was a teacher in the Sunday-school for a long while. Both he and his wife were thorough Methodists, active in work and liberal in giving. He was a member of the official board and the first secretary of the church. He held a class-meeting of the Methodist students at the University. He refused an invitation to dine with Thomas Jefferson because the dinner was given on Sunday. Mrs. William Wertenbaker, mother of the present Col. William Wertenbaker, was one of the first members of the Charlottesville Church, having joined the congregation here while they were worshipping in the Episcopal Church, before 1835. Robert Jones, the father of Mrs. S. W. Sterling, was a member at an early date, as was also Mrs. Malcolm Crawford. Miss Fannie Vandergrift, whose faithful work as teacher of the infant class is too well known to need comment, joined the Church in 1839. Mr. J. B. Hawkins became a member in 1847. For a long time the Methodist preachers received only $100. a year in addition to their board. Messrs Whitehead, Early, Poulton, August, Granbery and Judkins boarded with John M. Godwin, who gave to some of them at least their board without charge. The present church was begun before the Civil War. The auditorium was not finished for some years, and the congregation worshipped in the lecture room. Within six or eight years after completion it was remodeled. While the new church was being built the congregation used the Presbyterian church, which was courteously offered for their service. Dr. Wm. E. Edwards, in 1868, was the first married preacher sent to Charlottesville, though several of them married while here. Among the many pastors who have served this charge were: David S. Doggett, Jno. C. Granbery. W. W. Duncan, Paul Whitehead, Wm. E. Edwards, Adam Bledsoe, J. Wiley Bledsoe, B. F. Lipscomb, C. L. Bane, and Wm. H. Edwards. In 1896 while Dr. J. Wiley Bledsoe was pastor, it was thought necessary to erect an additional church, and under the auspices of the Epworth League, the work on Belmont Church was begun. This was soon completed, and Rev. George E. Booker, D. D. now a good work is being done there. The Virginia Annual Conference has met here a number of times. The last time being November 1903. The membership of the church is now about 1000, with 550 in the Sunday-school. An Epworth League, Rosebud Missionary Society, the Woman's and Young Woman's Missionary Societies are all in prosperous working order. The present building was remodeled about 12 years ago, and improvements are now in contemplation. The present pastor, Rev. G. E. Booker, D. D., is one of the leading pulpit orators in the state. He is in great demand as a lecturer, and by his strong preaching and good pastoral work, has added many to the church register. Beth Israel. The Hebrews of Charlottesville have conducted a house of worship here for at least half a century. The old synagogue stood on the site of the handsome new Federal building on Market street. When the Goverment purchased the property it donated to the congregation all the old building material and owing to this fact a handsome new structure was erected in 1903 at the corner of 3d and Jefferson Streets at a comparatively small expenditure. The Synagague has a seating capacity for three hundred. The Catholic Church of the Holy Paraclete. The first mass that was held in Charlottesville was celebrated in the parlors of Mr. Paoli's residence by Rev. Father Andrew. After this, mass was said in the Town Hall, by Rev. Fathers Bichio, Weed and McVerry, until the present church was built on July 25, 1880. The edifice was erected by donations, the chief of which was one by the late Martin Tracy, who gave seventy-five acres of land. This gift was disposed of, bringing the sum of $1,300. This was managed by Rev. Father McVerry, who built the present place of worship. Rev. Father McVerry being the pastor of the church in Staunton, this church came under his control and remained so until Rev. Father Massey was appointed Pastor here in October, 1898. The latter put new life in the church and after a short stay, was succeeded by Rev. Father Walsh, who took up the work and developed the church wonderfully. The church building was renovated and added to, and is now an ornament to the city. The present pastor is Rev Father Crow, who came here March 19, 1902. During the four years of his pastorate, he has accomplished a great deal of good work in the upbuilding of the church. The pretty little rectory, which adjoins the church, was built by the present pastor. High Street Baptist Church. The High Street Baptist Church was organized Oct. 9th, 1900, and is therefore not six years old yet. The present house of worship was built in 1901. The congregation worshiped in the Levy Hall till their own house was completed. The church started with only fifty members and now has nearly three hundred. The growth has been steady. No sensational or high pressure methods are used to win members or to raise money. Simplicity and direct appeal to Christian conscience and intelligence characterize the worship Methodist Episcopal Church, South. and work of this church. The pastor, the Rev. Henry Wise Tribble, D. D., has been in charge since the church was instituted. He had served the First Baptist Church of this city five and a half years before he took charge of the new organization. As many of his present flock came out of the mother church, he has been their pastor about eleven years. The church has in its membership a number of the most vigorous young men, as well as some of the most faithful women, in our city, and its future is bright. Its Sunday-school room is well arranged for such work and its main audience room is one of the prettiest to be found anywhere. Oakwood Cemetery "The hand of the King that the sceptre hath borne, The brow of the priest that the mitre hath worn. The eye of the sage, and the heart of the brave, Are hidden and lost in the depths of the grave. The peasant whose lot was to sow and to reap, The herdsman who climbed with his goats to the steep, The beggar that wandered in search of his bread, Have faded away like the grass that we tread. Two of the oldest cemeteries—Oakwood and Maplewood—of Charlottesville, are owned by the city, and any history of this vicinity would indeed be incomplete without a sketch of these cities of the dead within whose confines the remains of its past brilliant careers as well as those who in their time constituted the woof and warp of the complex fabric of human existence? Oakwood cemetery is located on a little knoll on Oak street near the suburbs of the town. In this quiet and sylvan spot repose the ashes of many well known old citizens, among them being Rev. James Gates, Rev. Jacob Manning and the wife of the Rev. C. E. Bane, all of the Methodist church; Rev. and Hon. John E. Massey, ex-Lieutenant Governor of Virginia, who died April 24, 1901, and his son who was killed on the Southern Railway; Charles M. Brand, printer and reporter, who was on the staff of The Progress, Chronicle and Jeffersonian for many years, who died Jan. 14, 1897. On his tomb are the words "How many hopes lie buried here." William T. Morris, who was killed Aug. 3, 1857, in an explosion of his slate quarry over Monticello mountain and his son, "Blind" Tom, who lost his eye sight at the same catastrophe; C. F. Christian, who was killed at the fire of Chas. King &amp; Son, May 31, 1897. Capt. John C. Culin of the Monticello Guard, who lost a leg in the Civil War, James Robert Neville Russell, son of General Leghmere Russell, G. B., of Askford Hall, Shropshire, England, Hamilton Potts, Benj. F. Grove, James M. Tilman. Here also may be seen the graves of nine victims of the wreck on the Southern Railway at Rock Fish July 7, 1903. Seven of these were Italian and Russian emigrants and the other two were Chas. W. Hamilton and J. Thomas Shepherd, brakemen. To Mr. J. F. Williams, the Superintendent of Cemeteries, great credit is due for the splendid condition in which the grounds are kept and the many marked improvements. When Mr. Williams came into office six years ago the streets bordering Oakwood were full of great mud holes in which carriages were often stranded. These have all been filled in and banks cut through. A beautiful new stone wall now borders more than half the grounds and supplants an old picket fence. In the centre of the cemetery a fountain plays and around this are Mr. Williams' flower beds in which he takes great pride. Oakwood consists of about six acres of land and was established about 1860. Maplewood Cemetery. "Here rests his head upon lap of Earth, A youth to Fortune and Fame unknown; Fair Science frowned not on his humble birth And Melancholy marked him for her own." MAPLEWOOD Cemetery is located on Maplewood Avenue and was opened about 1827 on what was formerly a part of the old Sinclair farm. Among the interments there are Rev. James Stuart Hanckel, Rector of the Protestant Episcopal church, Belle Tevis, wife of Henry Laning, M. D., for nine years a missionary in Japan, Carl H. Hotopp, who was killed on the C. &amp; O. Railway near Basic City; Rev. Paul Whitehead of the M. E. Church, Judge Egbert R. Watson, ex-Mayor R. F. Harris, ex-Mayor Benj. R. Pace, Major Robert F. Mason, Philip Agnew McNeale, the boy who lost his life at the Brown School fire May 7, 1902; Job The Church of the Holy Paraclete—Roman Catholic. Foster of Batavia, N. Y., a member of Robinson &amp; Eldreds Circus, who was killed here by an elephant Dec. 22, 1851; Lieut. Col. G. A. Harrell of the 14th Tennessee regiment, Col. Jno. R. Jones, Lieut. James L. Daniel, Rev. J. M. Hedrick, Col. R. T. W. Duke, Past Grand Master of Masons; Dr. James A. Leitch, General Jno. M. Jones, James Alexander, who published the Jeffersonian Republican; Lieut. W. W. Alexander, Capt. J. B. Alexander, Miss Maud Coleman Woods, daughter of Micajah Woods, who had the reputation of being one of the handsomest girls in the South and an active worker in the Daughters of the Confederacy; J. Farish, for many years County Treasurer, R. H. Rawlings, founder of Rawlings Institute; Crawford J. and William A., the young sons of John C. Patterson Jr., who lost their lives at the great theatre fire in Chicago Dec. 30, 1903; General Long and his wife, who for many years was Postmistress here; Wm. T. Jones, formerly City Treasurer; Major Horace W. Jones, a teacher for 50 years. In the Wertenbaker section are the bodies of six children who in 1862 died within a few weeks of each other. Here too is the body of the boy Stuart Wertenbaker who died Aug. 21, 1872 and a stone tool chest containing tools lays near the grave. Near the centre of the cemetery is the grave of Letitia Shelby who died Sept. 8, 1777, and was formerly buried in a garden nearby. The other cemeteries of the city are Riverview on the Woolen Mills road, the Hebrew, opposite Oakwood, the University of Virginia grounds and the daughters of Zion for colored people. PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH. Riverview Cemetery. ABOUT one mile east from town on what is known as the Woolen Mills road, is beautiful Riverview Cemetery. Just outside the grounds are the ancient The High Street Baptist Church. graves of the famous Lewis family whose history is so intermingled with that of Virginia, and one of whose number was Meriwether Lewis the friend of Jefferson and member of the Lewis and Clark Louisiana Purchase Expedition. The cemetery rests on high land overlooking the peaceful little Rivanna river winding its way to the sea while from above overlooking the valley stands "Monticello" once the home of one of the world's greatest statesmen. It was this spot that many of the leading public men of the early days of the Republic had favored for the site of the Capitol of the United States. It was the dream of Jefferson to be able to look down from the heights of his mountain home on the capitol of the nation and the University of Virginia, both of which with his other achievements would stand as lasting momuments to his name and generation. Riverview was chartered and laid out in 1887 and covers about thirty acres. The first officers of the company were W. D. Warren, president; J. W. Marshall, vice-president; W. Graham Page, secretary; Herbert H. Wingfield, treasurer. The grounds are prettily laid out, and each year sees many marked improvements. The cemetery being some distance from the city it is but natural to believe that it will be scores of years before the town will build around it, as in the case of some of the older burial grounds, and where, in time, it will be but a matter when demands are made for their purchase for city building lots to the great distress of relatives. Then, again, plots are sold on the most fair and reasonable terms and in a way that any family of ordinary means may become a purchaser, and thus assure themselves that they are positive to remain with their loved ones long after the Angel of Death has called them from the walks of this mortal life. The present officers of the company are all gentlemen of high character and well known to our people for their sterling methods in both commercial and social circles. Mr. W. The Hebrew Synagogue. J. Tyson is president, H. C. Marchant vice president; Thomas T. Norman secretary and treasurer. The Board of Directors are Judge T. B. Lyons, H. C. Marchant J. W. Marshall, W. J. Tyson and Thomas T. Norman— "Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife Their sober wishes never learned to stray; Along the cool sequestered vale of life They kept the noiseless tenor of their way."

The Miller Manual Labor School of Albemarle was founded by Samuel Miller, who was born June 1, 1792 near the present site of the school. "Pine Knot," Albemarle County Retreat of President Roosevelt. Until he was grown Mr. Miller had to contend with dire poverty and great adversity; the great obstacles in the way of his education and advancement were however overcome by his uncommon energy and indomitable will, but he never forgot the hardships of his early days and determined to accumulate a fortune and establish a school for the children of his native county who might be too poor to get a good education. Mr. Miller's will laid a broad and deep foundation for the school. He specified that it should be "a school upon the manual labor principle." The importance and value of manual training in education is now highly appreciated and generally popular, but in making a proper estimate of Mr. Miller's foresight and good judgment it should be remembered that his will was made in 1859— long before manual training was an element in education—showing that he was far in advance of his time concerning this useful educational factor. But lest it be thought that his views were narrow or one-sided or that he leaned unduly toward the training of the hand, it is well to quote further from the will, wherein he states that the pupils shall be "instructed in all the branches of a good, plain, sound English education, the various languages, both ancient and modern, agriculture, and the useful arts." Few men of his, or any other time have had a broader view of education, and none in the south have ever given so liberally to the cause. Great as was Mr. Miller's gift to Albemarle county in money and in rare forethought and wise plans his work might have proven well-nigh useless if the execution of his trust had not fallen into wise and upright hands. There are many persons who have faithfully and ably done their part in the work of developing the great institution which offers such rare advantages to the youth of the county, but the names which stand out with special prominence in this respect are Nicholas M. Page, John L. Cochran, Chas. S. Venable, Francis H. Smith, Hezekiah Taylor, John T. Randolph, John M. White and Thomas S. Martin, each of whom in his capacity of Executor of the Estate, Judge of the County, or Member of the Board of Visitors has shown rare tact, wisdom and faithfulness in the discharge of his special duty There is one name however which; The Kitchen—Pine Knot. next to Samuel Miller, takes highest rank among those who have labored for the upbuilding of the Miller SchoolCapt. Charles E. Vawter, for twenty-eight years the Superintendent of the school, is the man who has done most to guide, shape and control the destinies of the institution and to inspire its pupils to noble efforts and point them to lofty aims. Mr. Miller died in 1869, but owing to protracted litigation, and other delays incident to reconstruction days in the south, the School was not opened until the fall of 1878, and it then started with only 21 pupils, one teacher and the superintendent. The institution developed rapidly and in less than five years it had 250 pupils and a long list of applicants that could not be admitted Miller Manual Labor School—Main Building. There are now 25 teachers and 250 pupils. Mr. Miller's comprehensive plans have been carriad out with care and faithfulness; the material equipment of the school, in its special lines, is perhaps not equalled in the south nor surpassed in the north. The courses of instruction are thorough and broad, and the fundamental idea is to give an all-round training not only to the hand, the body and mind, but also to the heart, the morals and the conscience, and to fit the pupils in the highest way for useful, happy lives. Over 1,000 pupils have gone out from the school, and a very large number of these occupy positions of great usefulness and responsibility throughout the Union, from New England to California and from Wisconsin to Texas, while a few are found in foreign lands. If the good done by the Miller School be judged only by the financial advantage to Mr. Miller's beneficiaries (an admittedly low standard for comparison,) it will be found that they now earn an amount greatly in excess of that which they would probably have been able to earn had they not enjoyed the advantages of the Miller School. This excess in earnings is already equal to a very large income upon the money left by Mr. Miller, and is steadily increasing. But greater and better than all this are the uplifting and ennobling influences which extend not only to the hundreds trained in the school, but to yet larger numbers who are being helped by the leavening influences which eminate in ever widening circles from those who have received the direct benefit of Mr. Miller's noble benefaction. The Red Lands Club. The Red Lands Club of this city was organized in February, 1905. It has just moved from its quarters on Jefferson street to its fine new home on Park street opposite the Courthouse. The premises are fitted throughout in the most elaborate manner and are a credit to the city. It may be interesting to note that on the site of this building formerly stood the ancient Swan Tavern conducted by old John Jewett and his son. It is not generally known to most of us that it was John Jewett who rode forty miles from Louisa Court House and gave the alarm to Jefferson at Monticello and to the Governor and Legislature of Virginia then in session at the Courthouse here, that the British under Tarleton were on their way to capture them. The body of Trooper Jewett lies buried in the grounds in rear of the club house. In the early part of the last century a movement was on foot to place a bronze tablet on the building to the memory of this hero of whom so little has been said or written. The Red Lands is the swell and aristocratic club of Charlottesville, and it is here that the F. F. V's. of the masculine gender meet o'nights in executive session. Albemarle Telephone Company. Through the Albemarle Telephone Company Charlottesville enjoys a service which is unsurpassed by any in the State, and the company enjoys the distinction of having more phones per capita than any city in Virginia, and ranks as to perfection with any in the United States, while the rates charged for service are much less than any exchange with same number of telephones. During the past few years this company has spent many thousands of dollars in the way of improving the county service and they now have the best rural service in the State. The executive office and building owned by the company is located on Sixth street near Market, and is thoroughly equipped with every modern improvement. The switch board is of the magnetic type and gives splendid satisfaction. All of the circuits, both in the city and county, are metallic and the service is most excellent. Fifteen operators are employed, the force being divided so as to keep an adequate number on duty at all times during the night and day. When the company opened for business Servant "Dick" and Horse "Virginia Chief,"—Pine Knot. they had 190 subscribers, while today they have 930 phones in operation in the city, and 277 in the county, and the number is being rapidly increased. The company now has about 300 miles of wiring and 4 miles of cable in city and 25 miles pole line in county. They make direct connection with the Southern Bell Company of Virginia, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, the Louisa Telephone Company, the Fluvanna Telegraph Company and the Farmers Mutual Telephone Company and the Culpeper Telepone Company. The first mentioned companies gives access to every part of the United States where telephones are in use, while the latter companies give connection in the counties in which they are located. For those who have no long distance phones the company has booths at their office, hotels and in other sections First Baptist Church—Colored. of the city. Extensive improvements are being made and a force of fourteen men are constantly engaged installing telephones and placing wiring for the increasing patronage. The company was organized and incorporated August 10, 1897, and the present officers are F. W. Twyman, president; J. B. Andrews, vice-president; H. A. Dinwiddie, secretary and treasurer, and J. Frank Kelley, superintendent. All of them are well known here and are energetic and enterprising young men. President Twyman, was born in Madison county but has lived here for many years and is identified with a number of well known enterprises. The directors of the company are: J. M. Robertson, Daniel Harman, John B. Moon, S. C. Chancellor, James F. Harlan, W. J. Tyson, T. J. Wills, P. Leterman, T. S. Keller, C. H. Walker, Mr. Andrews is a native of this city and besides the business described above is engaged in the seed and horse lines. Mr. Dinwiddie is also a son of Charlottesville and is now a student at the University of Virginia. Mr. Kelley, who has direct supervisior of the workings of the company, was born in this city and has held his present position since its formation. First (Colored) Baptist Church. This church was originally a part of the First white Baptist church of Charlottesville. In 1863 the colored members decided to affect and maintain a separate and distinct organization from that of their white friends. So pursuant to this agreement the colored church, known for a time as the Delevan church, was formed. Rev. John T. Randolph was the first pastor, and he was followed by Rev. James Fife, and John Walker George. In 1868 they purchased the present site, known as the "Old Mudwal" or "Delevan property." The first colored pastor was the Rev. William Gibbons who was succeeded by Rev. W. J. Barnett in 1870. He in turn was succeeded by Rev. M. T. Lewis, Rev. Alexander Truatt, Rev. R. Alonzo Scott, Rev. L. B. Goodall. The present pastor is Rev. R. C. Quarles, D. D., who was called to the church in 1895. Since coming here the Virginia Union University at Richmond conferred on Mr. Quarles the degree of Doctor of Divinity.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">WHO'S WHO IN CHARLOTTESVILLE LEADING PROFESSIONAL MEN, MANUFACTURERS &amp; MERCHANTS. HON. GEO. W. OLIVIER. Mayor of Charlottesville. THE office of Mayor is one of importance and requires a man of keen discernment, prompt action, firm decision, educational ability and character far above reproach. Such men, like the poet, are born and not made. A man of this class appears to be the present incumbent of this, the highest city office, Hon. George W. Olivier, who took his seat September 1, 1904. He is enterprising and has always had the future of the city at heart, ready to sacrifice his own private ambition to the public weal. Mayor Olivier is the proprietor of the University Book Store, (located near the University of Virginia) which has been established since 1825. Here not alone are the students supplied with all manner of school and text books but may be furnished with complete supplies including food, clothing, hats, shoes, stationery, sporting goods, etc., at exceedingly moderate prices. Mr. Olivier is also ticket agent for the C. &amp; O. Railway, Southern Express Company and the Adams Express Company. W. T. MARTIN, President Chamber of Commerce. When the brawn and brain of a good healthy business community confers such an honor on one of its fellow men as to select him for president of the Chamber of Commerce it is a clear indication, and goes without saying, that he is the man above all others whom they deem most worthy and competent to fill the coveted and responsible position. And in this direction the Chamber made an excellent choice when it called to the chair our worthy townsman Mr. W. T. Martin, a man who has always been full of public spirit and progressive ideas, and one who has always had the welfare of Charlottesville at heart.

Thirty-Six Years Prosecuting Attorney. It is an accepted fact by those who are cognizant of the standard of ability of lawyers, that the bench and bar of Charlottesville has but few peers and no superiors in any city of similar size in the country. Among the most prominent of the many very able attorneys-at-law of our city and State is Captain Micajah Woods, whose offices are located in the old and historic county courthouse. He is recognized throughout Virginia for his ability and eloquence. He is an advocate who is thoroughly read in every branch of the law, and an earnest and conscientious student of its continued changes and amendments. He is an indomitable worker in the fields of high thought and action. Captain Woods has gained his present high place at the bar by sheer force of merit and that sterling integrity of character that has made him so widely known and esteemed as a jurist and citizen. Many of the most difficult and important cases known to jurisprudence in this section of the State have been handled by Captain Woods. Among these may especially be mentioned the celebrated case of the State against the Hon. J. Samuel McCue, ex-mayor of Charlottesville, for the murder of his wife, in which he was associated with the Commonwealth's Attorney in the prosecution. Captain Woods' argument in this case was most eloquent and convincing and to him great credit for the verdict is undoubtedly due. In the prosecution of this deplorable case Captain Woods showed rare tact and discretion sparing the unfortunate man and what remained of his family all unnecessary ordeals; he only undertook the prosecution of the case for the people when enraged public sentiment had demanded a lynching if further delay occurred. Twenty-five hundred dollars was offered him for the work, which covered six weeks, but he refused to accept any compensation whatever. Captain Woods was born at "Holkham," Albemarle County, May 17, 1844. His early education was received at Lewisburg Academy, the Military School at Charlottesville, and at the Bloomfield Academy. In 1861 he entered the University of Virginia, and like many other students of the South joined the Confederate Army. He first served, when barely 17 years of age, as a volunteer aid on the staff of Gen'l. Jno. B. Floyd, in the West Va. Campaign of 1861; then in 1862, from May until October, he was a private in the Albemarle Light Horse, participating in the battles of Port Republic, seven days in front of Richmond, Stuart's Raid in rear of Pope's Army, Second Manassas, Leesburg, Crampton's Gap and Sharpsburg. Then he was made 1st Lieut. of Cavalry, in the Va. State Line under Gen'l. Floyd, and served as Adjutant Gen'l. of Clarkson's Brigade until that organization was disbanded in April, 1863, when he was elected and commissioned as First Lieut. of Jackson's Battery of Horse Artillery, Army of Northern Virginia, in which capacity he served until the close of the war, participating in many engagements, his Battery being in actions in front of Harrisburg, Pa., Gettysburg, Boonsboro, Md., Droop Mountain, Greenbrier Bridge, New Market, Tottapotami, Second Cold Harbor, Lynchburg, Leetown, North Mountain Depot, Frederick, in front of Georgetown, D. C., Ashby's Gap, Martinsburg, Cumberland, Moorefield, Fisher's Hill and Liberty Mills. He was twice slightly wounded, once at Gettysburg and again at Second Cold Harbor. At the close of the war he entered the University of Va., where he studied in the academic department and then studied law, being graduated in 1868, with the degree of Bachelor of Law. He immediately began the practice of his profession in Charlottesville, and in 1870 was elected Commonwealth Attorney, which position he has filled for thirty-six years without opposition. In 1872 Captain Woods was made a member of the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia, being the youngest visitor ever appointed to that institution. He has been Chairman of the Democratic County Committee for many years, and as an elector represented the Seventh Congressional District of Virginia, and was also a member of the Presidential Electoral Board in 1888, which cast the vote of Virginia for Grover Cleveland for President. In 1881 he was elected Captain of the Monticello Guard, and was with this famous old company at the Yorktown celebration, which took place in October of that year. When the Red Land Club, composed of many of the leading gentlemen of Charlottesville and Albemarle, was organized in February, 1905, Capt. Woods was unanimously chosen its first president, and at the annual meeting in February, 1906, he was reelected for another term. Lucian C. Watts High Sheriff of Albemarle County. In the person of Lucian C. Watts, High Sheriff of Albemarle County, we have a most efficient and fearless officer and worthy representative of the law. His official and private life is clean and honorable and he possesses in a high degree those qualities that go to make up a successful and satisfactory public official. By reason of the responsible duties devolving upon him as Sheriff, Mr. Watts has a deep knowledge and wide experience of men and affairs. His record is free from objectionable acts, and when his term of office expires he is eligible and most worthy of reelection purely on the ground of honorable and efficient service aside from any other consideration. He has proved himself one of our progressive and valuable citizens, and is a man who is held in high esteem by our very best citizens. Sheriff Watts is a native of Albemarle County and throughout his life has been a recognized leader among men. For many years he served as Deputy Sheriff under Sheriff Teel, and in 1887 was electen to his present office by a flattering majority. This position he has faithfully filled ever since and no storm of rain, hail or sleet has ever been too severe to detain him when duty called for his service in any section of the County. Mr. Watts is an enthusiastic and ardent horseman and is noted as one of the most expert and experienced trainers of saddle horses in Virginia. Mr. Watts resides at Stony Point, twelve miles from Charlotteville, where he is the owner of a beautiful home and farm, and one that is well becoming and suitable for the sterling character and American that he is. He is also the owner of many valuable blooded horses. Nothing makes people hate you more than for you to get along better than they do. RICHARD W. DUKE. Clerk of the Corporation Court. When a man has filled an important position of public trust for nearly two decades and ever since the place in which he resides became a city, it is evidence sufficient of his worthiness and ability without further comment, and Charlottesville has been served by such an official in the person of Mr. Richard W. Duke, clerk of the Corporation Court and deputy clerk of the Circuit Court. After receiving a good practical education he taught in the public schools for several years and until he was appointed deputy circuit clerk under Residence of R. W. Duke Bennett Taylor, and upon the resignation of the former was appointed to fill the vacancy. In 1884 Mr. Duke was elected to the office without opposition, and since the consolidation of the two offices named above has filled both with credit and to the entire satisfaction of all concerned. Mr. Duke is a wide awake, progressive official, who has established a record for careful, conscientious and painstaking service that will stand as a monument for many years to come. He is a genial, courteous gentleman, whose friends are limited only by his acquaintance, and the people of this community are to be congratulated in the possession of such an honest and capable official. During the Civil War Mr. Duke was a gallant member of Carrington's Battery, which was recruited in Albemarle county and saw valiant service throughout that awful campaign of blood and fire. In fraternal circles Mr. Duke is a popular and prominent member of the Order of Elks. W. L. MAUPIN, Clerk of the County Court. The county of Albemarle has long been noted for the able men who have filled its offices, and among the long list in whom the public has reposed honor and confidence none has enjoyed such high esteem as Mr. W. L. Maupin, clerk of the County and Circuit Courts. Mr. Maupin has been in public office for a number of years, and enjoys a most enviable reputation for efficiency. In keeping his records he uses the book typewriters which makes a clear print and one which will last and be far more legible in years to come than pen and ink records. Mr. Maupin was born in Albemarle County March 26, 1854, and moved with his parents to Augusta County where he resided for many years. After completing his education he engaged in agricultural pursuits which he followed until 1880 when he returned to this county and purchased one of the most fertile tracts of land in this section. He followed farming until 1887, when he was appointed a deputy clerk of the county court. He held this position for six years and in 1893 announced his candidacy for the office of county clerk, and was elected by a large majority. In 1899 he was again elected without opposition Under the new constitution the offices of county and circuit clerk were merged, and in 1905 Mr. Maupin was elected to the combined offices without opposition again. The term is for six years and will not expire until January, 1911. In fraternal circles Mr. Maupin is well known, being a member of the Elks and Odd Fellows and has passed through all the chairs of the latter organization. He is a lover of thoroughbred horses and is owner of "Pater" and "T. S. Martin," two runners that have brought renown to our county. As an authority on pedigrees and a judge of the qualities of a horse he has no peer in this horse-loving community. D. W. FOWLER. Commissioner of Revenue. There are but few men in Albemarle who are more highly esteemed by all classes of citizens than is Mr. D. W. Fowler, our Commissioner of Revenue. The making out and keeping tax and revenue records requires the greatest care, and a mistake made in them might result in much trouble and expense to those concerned. In consequence only the most trusted citizens are usually given this office. Mr. Fowler, the present incumbent has held the position for eight years, having been elected by a handsome majority in 1898, and has given the greatest satisfaction to everyone having business with the office. During all this time the duties have been performed with conscientious care and the records kept in a most satisfactory manner. Mr. Fowler is a native of Charlottesville, and has spent his life here. During all this time he has always been held in the highest esteem by all who know him. Mr. Fowler was appointed by Judge Duke in April 1897 and succeeded his father who had held this position and was also Mayor of the city. Since then he has been twice elected. He is a member of the Elks and the Red Land Club. Mr. Fowler received his education at the famous old University of Virginia, where he took a course in law. CHARLES H. WALKER, City Treasurer. Among the city officials none is more highly esteemed than Mr. Charles H. Walker our able treasurer. He was born at Louisa Court House, spent his boyhood days there. At the opening of the Civil War he was too young to enlist but later embued with a patriotism which had been kindled when the guns of the South echoed over Fort Sumpter, and having attained an age which permitted him to enlist he hurried to the front and entered the famous Mosby Command. He served in many of the noted Mosby raids and at the fight of Berryville, August 13, 1864, he was badly wounded. He came to this city immediately after the war practically unknown, but by close application to business he gained promotion and in 1875 moved to Farquier county where he entered the merchandise line for himself and where he successfully conducted business for twenty years. In 1893 he established in this city the Charlottesville Hardware Company, now the Walker, Carroll-Adams-Company. In March 1901 he was appointed city treasurer by Judge George W. Morris to fill out the unexpired term of the late Mr. John L. Walters. At the city primary last September Mr. Walker received the nomination of his party and was elected. The Conway Printing Company. THE "art preservative of all arts" has not only contributed vastly to the progress of the world in all the arts and sciences, but has itself made as noteworthy progress as any within the achievements of mankind. The origin of the art of printing is shrouded in mystery. It is impossible to say when or by whom it was first used even in its crudest form, Marco Polo found the art being practiced in the far East, and it is on record that in the remotest antiquity the Orientals used stamps with colored inks on their documents of various kinds. Of printing in general it may be said that more progress has been made in the last century than in all the preceding centuries combined. Modern printing had its origin in the decade 1831-41. The printing press had slowly, very slowly grown from Gutenberg's primitive machine, through the improvements of Blaeuw, Stanhope, Clymer and others until it was reserved for Robert Hoe to built in 1832 the first cylinder press in America. But notwithstanding all the great improvements there are, and always will be good and bad printers, those who do good work and those who do poor work. Among the very best printers in Virginia may be mentioned the Conway Printing Company of 423 East Main street. This prosperous and flourishing enterprise was organized here about sixteen months ago by Mr. A. V. Conway, one of our most progressive and energetic citizens. At this establishment which is equipped with all the very latest and most improved job and cylinder presses, the finest book and job printing is accomplished at the shortest notice. The prices, too, are the most reasonable for the splendid work turned out and it is to the Conway Printing Company that we would advise all in search of this manner of work to send their orders. The career of Mr. Conway the founder is another of the many examples that go to demonstrate what push and perseverence can accomplish. Mr. Conway was born near Broad Run, Fauquier county, Virginia. His education was received in the district schools, Bethel Academy in Fauquier county, Va. After more or less of a knock-about career and at the age of fourteen he found a position as clerk in the employment with the general merchandise Residence of J. H. Lindsay. house of Norman &amp; Smith of Charlottesville. He next clerked for J. W. Marshall, in the dry goods line, and then in the freight department of C. &amp; O. railroad. After this he purchased an interest in the business of J. W. Marshall which he sold back in fifteen months and then formed the partenship of Hewitt &amp; Conway after having bought out the confectionary business of B. E. Jeffries, 218-220 West Main street. In 1902 Mr. Conway married and in that same year bought out Mr. Hewitt's interest in the business and took Col. Henry M. Lewis (now of the Jefferson Bank) into partnership, forming the firm of Conway &amp; Lewis. In 1897 Mr. Conway sold his interest to Mr. J. M. Cochran and then entered the commission business, forming the firm of Michie &amp; Conway who located near the C. &amp; O. railway. In 1900 Mr. Conway entered the office of The Daily Progress as its business manager in which capacity he continued until May 10, 1902 when he, with others formed the well known Michie Grocery Company and became its secretary and treasurer. On October 1, 1903 Mr. Conway again cast his fortune with the Progress and there remained until December 23, 1904 when he organized the Conway Printing Company. Mr. Conway, it goes without saying, has made his mark in the world and has by hard, honest work accumalated quite a respectable fortune. He is the owner of considerable real estate. He is a director of the Charlottesville Brick Company and of the Charlottesville &amp; Albemarle Railway Company. He is an ex-member of the City Council and is a prominent member of the Board of Trade. Piedmont Real Estate and Loan Company. The high prices offered for real estate in Charlottesville and Albemarle County is the best criterion of the prosperous condition of this community, and the fact that few people desire to sell is further evidence of the "good place" in which we live. Of the companies engaged in the real estate line none is more prominent than the Piedmont Real Estate and Loan Company. This concern occupies a handsome suite of offices in the Law building on North Fifth street and controls a large patronage. While they do a general real estate business, renting, selling and buying all descriptions of property and negotiating loans, they make a specialty of selling farms, fruit and timber lands, and their business extends over the entire United States. The present company was incorporated July, 1904, and while only a new "Wilton" Home of J. Anderson Chisholm. concern it has already secured a large rental and sale list. The officers of the company are Major Channing M. Bolton, President, C. H. Walker, Vice President, E. L. Carroll, Secretary and Treasurer, and W. H. Wolfe, General Manager. Mr. Bolton, the President, is one of the best known business men in the city, being President of the Charlottesville and Albemarle Railway Company and the Charlottesville Canning Factory, and a director in the Charlottesville Ice Company and the Jefferson National Bank of Charlottesville. He was born near Richmond, Virginia, but has resided here for many years, occupying a magnificent home a few miles from the city. Mr. C. H. Walker, the Vice President was born in Louisa County and served with distinction during the war between the States. He is city treasurer and one of its wealthiest men, being interested in many of the largest enterprises. Mr. E. L. Carroll, the Secretary and Treasurer, was torn in Smyth County and has resided in this city for the past twelve years. Prior to the formation of the Piedmont Real Estate and Loan Company he was engaged in the insurance business and still follows that line. Mr. Wolfe, under whose direct management the business is conducted, is well posted on realty matters in this section having been engaged in that line for many years. He was born in this city and received his early education here. At the opening of the war he enlisted as a private in Company I, Twenty-Fourth Virginia Infantry, which became a part of Picketts Division, and took part in all the important battles in which that famous division engaged. May 31st, 1862, he was severely wounded at Residence of Dr. J. Emmett Early. the battle of Seven Pines but after recovering returned to his company, and on May 12, 1864, he was again wounded, this time at Drury's Bluff. On April 1st, 1865, he was captured at Five Forks and was sent to Point Lookout, where he was held a prisoner until June 22 of that year, when he was released. He returned to the Valley of Virginia and entered the mercantile line, in which he continued sixteen years—seven years ago he opened a real estate and insurance business in this city which he operated until the formation of the firm described. All of the gentlemen are public spirited and progressive citizens. W. J. Tyson. Of the concerns in this city that cater to the highest class of exclusive family trade none is more prominent than the one conducted by Mr. W. J. Tyson at 311 East Main Street. The store is a commodious one, brilliantly lighted and filled with the best and most artistic showcases and counters. The stock carried is of the finest quality and could not be duplicated outside of the largest cities. It comprises everything in the way of staple and fancy groceries, fine teas, coffees, canned goods, and a choice line of imported and domestic liquors and wines for family and table use. The trade is a large one and extends over the entire South, the shipping business being especially large. Mr Tyson also owns another place at Norfolk which is one of the largest there and is under the managment of his son, Mr. Jerrold Tyson. As a public officer, citizen and Residence of W. J. Tyson. man of business, Mr. W. J. Tyson's record is a long and honorable one. He was born in Wheeling, Virginia, in 1839, and after completing his education went to Baltimore where he engaged in the mercantile business. He remained there for twenty-five years, and in 1869 came to this city where he entered business. In 1876 he established his present enterprise and today enjoys a patronage unexcelled. Mr Tyson has always had an eye open for the promotion of the interest of the municipality and for twelve years was a member of the City Council and has advocated many measures for the benefit of the place. He was a member of the finance, building and city lighting committees, and was one of the most ardent workers in the body. In addition to this he is a director in the Albemarle Telephone Company and President of the Riverview Cemetery Company. He is a member of the Masons, Royal Arcanum and the Knights of Honor. A. P. Bibb. A large number of firms are engaged in the joint real estate and insurance business and among them none is more prominent than the Virginia Realty and Insurance Company, incorporated with offices on North Fouth street. This concern was incorporated about two years ago and in that time has built up a large business in both its branches. In the realty line a general business in buying, renting and selling all description of property, city and suburban, improved and unimproved is done. Speciality is made of farm lands and the sales in this style of property alone amounts to a very large sum. In the insurance branch the company does a fire and bonding business and represents the following concerns: Hartford, Phenix Caladonian, Pallatine, Southern Underwriters and the American Bonding Company. These are among the strongest companies in the United States being built on a most substantial financial basis. The insurance business is under the management of Mr. L. C. Woods, secretary of the company, while the real estate business is in charge of Mr. A. P. Bibb. These gentlemen are among our most enterprising citizens and have had a number of years' experience in the lines they handle. Mr. Woods was born near Ivy depot, in Albemarle county, and was educated in the schools of that place and later entered the University of Virginia, where he completed his course. After leaving school he worked for a time as a civil engineer and ten years ago came to this city and entered the insurance business and continued with great success. Mr. Bibb is a native of Charlottesville, having been born and reared here, served in war between the States, and at close of hostilities he returned here and entered the mercantile line, in which he continued for many years. About fifteen years ago he started in the real estate field. Under the administrations of President Cleveland Mr. Bibb was postmaster at the University office and filled it in a manner which was an honor to the man who appointed him. In fraternal circles Mr. Bibb is a Mason. Valentine and Nicholas. Of the insurance companies operating here none is more prominent or built on a firmer financial basis than the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York. Each year its business has increased until today its assets have reached the enormous figure of $470,000,000, and are composed only of gilt edge securities. The business of the company here is under the able management of Messrs. Valentine and Nicholas, 514 East Main street—two of the most estimable men in the county, and both thoroughly posted on every detail pertaining to insurance. Their district comprises Albemarle, Nelson and Buckingham Counties, and the number of policies placed in this section recently is the best evidence of the thorough competence of the men in charge. Mr. R. P. Valentine is one of our best known citizens, having been born and reared here, and has aided materially in building up the business welfare of the town. While he has only been in the insurance business for about eight years, he An Albemarle Blossom. has been engaged in the wholesale coal line here for the past thirty-three years and is also interested in several banks, the Street Railway Company, and is Vice President of the Charlottesville Woolen Mills, and the Marchant Manufacturing Company. Mr. R. C. Nicholas was born in Buckingham County, and after leaving school followed agricultural pursuits for a while. Twenty years ago he entered the insurance field, and his success has been phenomenal. During the boom of 1890 he went to Pulaski County and carried on a real estate business in addition to insurance. He has been connected with the Mutual Life for twelve years, and is one of their best men. He is a prominent Mason. The Peoples National Bank. Nothing affords such sure protection for one's savings and at the same time making them a paying investment as a bank, and among the institutions of this description in the Old Dominion, none is more conspicuous than the Peoples National Bank of our prosperous little city. In addition to being one of the strongest in the State, this bank is the oldest in point of service in the city, and for years has enjoyed the trust and confidence of the people, and at the end of its first thirty years of existence is stronger and more flourishing than ever. The bank was organized under a charter granted by the State in 1875, and begun business the same year as a State bank. The public reposed confidence in the officers who were back of the enterprise, and in a short time the concern was doing a large business. In 1881 a National charter was applied for and received, and since then the company has done business as a National bank. The building is situated on East Main street in the heart of the business center, and is one of the most substantial in the city. The interior is handsomely furnished and arranged in such a manner that business can be transacted with the utmost expediency.

This office he held until 1904, when he was elected Judge of the Eighth Judicial District, which he now fills. In 1895 he was elected president of the bank. Aside from his legal and judicial duties, Judge White is interested in a number of other enterprises, being Vice President of the Michle Publishing Company, Vice President of the Charlottesville Lumber Company, and a director in the Marchant Manufacturing Company and the Charlottesville Woolen Mills. Mr. Robertson, the cashier, was born in Danville, Virginia, and after leaving school went to Richmond, where he engaged in the exportation of leaf tobacco. He made quite a success of this venture, but closed it out about ten years ago to accept a position with the bank. He is also interested in a number of other business enterprises. Robert P. Valentine. No name in Albemarle County stands out more conspicuously in financial and mercantile circles than that of Robert P. Valentine, a gentleman who requires no introduction to any of our citizens. He is the leading wholesale coal merchant in this section of the county, and is interested in numerous other enterprises. He is Vice President of the Charlottesville Woolen Mills, Vice President of the H. C. Marchant Manufacturing Company, and is of the insurance firm of Valentine &amp; Nicholas. Since 1872, when Mr. Valentine first engaged in business here as a coal merchant, he has always stood in the front ranks as a most progressive and public spirited citizen, ever ready and willing to A Gala Day at the Albemarle Horse Show. do all in his power for the welfare of the city. When Charlottesville had fallen behind in the progress of the times, it was he who conceived and organized the Charlottesville Improvement Company, an organization composed of many of the leading men of the town, and purely philanthropical in its character, and having for its aim the thorough renovation and modernization of the city. Of this society he was elected president, and from it in a large measure has sprung the present prosperous condition of the community. He also organized and practically owned the street railway line from 1887 to 1894, when electric power superseded that of the horse. He was, and still is active as one of the organizers of the electric light system. At one time Mr. Valentine was honored with the presidency of the Young Mens Christian Association of Charlottesville. Mr. R. L. Valentine, his son, is engaged in the retail coal, wood, lime and cement business at 100 South street. He has a good and growing trade, and has the confidence of the people. Fire Creek Coal is his specialty. THE GREAT HORSE SHOW. August First and Second. THERE is no leading event that takes place in Charlottesville that is looked forward to with greater pleasure both by the young and the old than the grand annual horse show. And it may be truly said that but few incidents contribute more to the fame of our fair city, or have brought better results to its commercial life, than this mammoth and creditable enterprise. Outside of the pastime and outing that it affords the general public, it has stimulated the production of fine blooded horses that have gained for Albemarle County a reputation that will never die. The yearly exposition of the Albemarle Horse Show Assocation is held a short distance from the city at what is known as Fry's Spring and is reached by trolley cars that let passangers off at the main entrance to the grounds. The place is provided with grand and band stands splendid stalls for the accommodation of the exhibits, refresh ment booths, etc. The gentlemen of the Association are all business men of the highest standing who are imbued with the idea of this worthy undertaking where both pleasure and profit are combined. At these annual shows may be seen many celebrated thorough breds, standards and hunters. Stallions of speed and draft that have made the Red Lands famous. The Horse Show is Albemarle's great social event and is taken advantage of as the proper time for annual reunions of old friends throughout this and adjoining counties and state. The doors of the homes of our city are thrown wide open, hospitality is the countersign that admits all, and every visitor is simply asked to enjoy himself. On the second night always occurs the big "German" in the Armory, and the famous old Stonewall Brigade Band of Staunton provides the music for our young gallants and fair maids, as many years ago they led our fathers through the valleys and into the storm of shot and shell. This year the show takes place August 1st and 2nd, and liberal prizes will be offered. Every horse owner is invited to show what kind of a horse he or she has, and it will be no disgrace to lose a ribbon, for those defeated can feel assured that they! have been beaten by the best horse flesh that can be produced. The Association was organized in 1900, and Mr. J. T. Haxall was its first president. For a time its success seemed doubtful, but the promoters soon succeeded in arousing the interest of the citizens, until today the horse show revenue is second to that of no other enterprise here. The president is Mr. George L. Mason, and Mr. Joel Cochran is manager, and they are supported by an array of prominent men that recognize no such word as fail. In 1905 12,000 people passed through the gates, and this year, coming as it does at a season when all classes can afford a little recreation, after all the crops have been reaped and stored, is expected to far exceed all others. What they desire to impress upon the people is the fact that here in old Albemarle we have the very best blooded horses, horses with pedigrees that go far back beyond any of our lives, that the exhibition is one of the greatest sights of the United States, and that here we have stalwart men and fair women, forming a society nowhere excelled—Come to the show. Life is a casket, not precious in itself, but valuable in proportion to what fortune or industry or virtue has placed within it.—Landor. When we think of the ease with which we deceive others we should think of the ease with which others may deceive us. Warren &amp; Cloud. Insurance of every description is essential to every one in these days of rush and bustle as it is practically impossible to tell when calamity may come, and unless indemnified against it leaves one stranded on the shoals of life. In our city the name of Warren &amp; Cloud is rapidly becoming identified as the most prominent in the insurance and real estate line. Though only newcomers in the business field, they have won a wide popularity and have built up a business of which any company might well be proud. The office is located at Jefferson and Fifth streets. They handle all branches of insurance, Fire, Life, Accident, Casualty, Health, Burglar, Liability and Bonding. Among the companies they represent is the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, which is the largest exclusive dividend company in the world, and all policies participate in the annual dividends. Thus the policy holder receives the actual earnings on his premiums each year, reducing the size of his payments or adding to the value of the policy by purchasing additional insurance with these dividends. Another excellent feature of the Massachusetts Life policy is, that where within five years from the date of lapse a provision is made for reinstatement. This progressive agency also represent the Travelers Life, Travelers Casualty Company and the United States Casualty Company, both concerns issuing health and accident policies. In the fire line they are representatives for the German, of Freeport; Insurance Company North America, Atlas of London; and the Equitable of Charleston. They are also agents for the American Surety Company, a bonding concern, and the New York Plate Glass Insurance Company. All of these companies are recognized leaders, and are among the most reliable and stable in the country representing combined assets of over $125,000,000. The firm also does a general real estate business, buying, selling and renting property of every description, and many of the large transactions of the past few months were conducted through them. The members of the firm are Mr. J. W. Warren and Mr. W. T. Cloud, and both have had years of experience in the business, though the firm was not organized until September last. Mr. J. W. Warren was born in Massachusetts. He entered the insurance business in 1894 and continued it for himself until the formation of the present firm. Mr. W. T. Cloud is a native of Texas, (but is of a Virginia family) and came here twenty-five years ago. For a number of years he was ticket agent for the Chesapeake and Ohio railroad at this point. Four years ago he resigned to enter real estate and his success has been phenomenal. "Castle Hill," Home of Princess Troubetskoy nee Amelle Rives, Author of "The Quick or the Dead." Wills Drug Company. In 1853, just fifty-three years ago, Mr. F. M. Wills, president of the Wills Drug Company, entered the drug business in this city. It will surprise many to learn that this active, energetic gentleman has been actively engaged in the drug business longer than any other man in the United States. But mere length of service is not enough; the main thing after all is the value of a man's work, and this has been clearly demonstrated in two ways:—first, by the confidence of the people who have had large opportunities for judging, and second:—by the quality of the preparations manufactured. By either measure when weighed in the balance, Mr. Wills is found not wanting. Hundreds of people in this vicinity have become so imbued with a feeling of safety in intrusting their prescriptions to his care that they would not know where to turn without him. And, surely, half a century of correct work is enough to inspire confidence. But even more certain as a guide to worth are the preparations which this company manufactures, for they are the results of years of thought, of experiment, of painstaking and skilled labor, and more than all the rest, of years of intelligent observation of the action of the various compounds as remedies for the ills that flesh is heir to. Under these circumstances it is not surprising that many of these preparations have proved of such great value that they are sold in many states of the Union, mail orders from patrons at a distance receiving special and prompt attention. In these days of nostrums, quacks and fakes, it is refreshing to find a firm whose reputation for fair dealing and honest medicines enables us to use with confidence any preparation bearing their name. Among the preparations which have proved so acceptable and efficacious we only mention a few. Wills' Compound, White Pine Cough Syrup, a valuable remedy for cough, colds and similar affections, Aperient Liquid Phospho Soda, Wills' Quick Cure for internal and external pains, Randolph's Antiseptic Dyspepsia Pills, Wills' Magic Liniment, Wills' Vermifuge, Wills' Flavoring Extracts, and many others that are prepared under the direct supervision of Mr. Wills, guaranteeing purity and accuracy in every detail. Let us not forget to mention right here that Scottsville, Albemarle County is the home of the Hon. Thomas S. Martin, the dauntless and brilliant United States Senator. Oh Albemarle, Albemarle where doth thy fame end? The Jefferson National Bank. A secure place in which to put money is generally the first thought of the man of means, and no investment or place offers surer or safer protection than a bank, which, while affording this pays a liberal interest on its deposits. Of the banks in this city none is more prominent or safer than the Jefferson National, and, although a newcomer, it has forged its way steadily to the front, until today it is recognized as a leader. The building, one of the handsomest in the city, is located in East Main street, and its interior fittings are quite elaborate. This building is fronted with gray brick, trimmed with terra cotta, with sanded cornices to match. The entire front is purely Greek in every particular. At the entrance are five Ionic columns of gray brick with terra cotta capitals and bases trimmed with Ohio sandstone. The two front entrance doors, made by the Van Kannel Revolving Door Company of New York, and put up by the local contractors, are provided with strong locks and bolts, and are made of quartered whiteoak. Above these doors is a handsome wrought-iron gallery running the length of the building. The tympanum above is composed of gray brick and of cornices to match the sandstone trimmings. The ceiling of the portico is decorated with the Greek key. In this building the first story West is occupied by the Jefferson National Bank proper, by the vaults, and the directors' and customers' rooms. The front room on the East side is occupied by the Postal Telegraph-Cable Company. The entire second story is given to private office rooms. The entire building is wired for electric lights and is supplied with gas throughout. Steam heat is used. Electric wires also connect bells all over the building, the annunciator being located in the main hall. Every modern convenience is installed. In the bank proper, the first door to the right leads to the cashier's private office, the public entrance hall being fitted with the desks for the bank's patrons. Next to the cashier's office is the "work room" of the bank, as it is called, and immedidiately in the rear of this and near the vault is the customer's room for the private use of any patron. Behind this room is that of the board of directors. The vault to the west of the customer's room, and in view of the general public, immediately on entering the door, is steel, burglar-proof, and embodies all modern improvements. It is as handsome a piece of work as can be found in the State. The double vault (the fire-proof or storage vault) has one of Diebold's best fire-proof doors. The burglarproof vaults have a very heavy channel steel lining, one and one-half inches thick and absolutely drill and fire proof. The vestibule and inside doors are of the same material with bankers' combination lock subject to five millions of changes, it is said, and with cut-off spindle going only half way through the door and worked off with cog wheels and an automatic "anti-dynamite" trigger. The outer door to this vault is about five inches thick, made solid with no spindles for combination locks, which give the burglar a weak place to attack and break through the door without having to soften and drill. The bolts are controlled automatically and locked by the Diebold triple time lock with Howard movement. The deposit boxes are of the latest improved double-nose master key locks, with Japanned boxes inside. Just outside the vault is the "clipping room" for patrons. The bank building was designed by Mr. W. T. Vandegrift, architect, of this city, who had charge of the place until its completion. The contractors were the King Lumber Company the heating, plumbing and metal work was done by R. L. Thomas, and the electrical work was done by the local Electric Company, thus giving nearly all the work to home workmen. The interior decorations were executed by Mr. Jacob Draper, of Culpeper, the vault was put in by the Barnes Lock and Safe Company, of Richmond, and the furniture was installed by the Grand Rapids Furniture Company, of Michigan. The Bank was organized 1901, and a National charter issued a few weeks later. November the second of that year the concern opened for business, and since then its list of depositors has steadily increased, and its business expanded, until today it ranks with any similar institution in the State from a point of stability. The officers of the bank are C. J. Rixey, president, G. B. Sinclair, vice president, and Thomas P. Peyton, cashier. All of the gentlemen are thoroughly versed in matters pertaining to finances, and their investments are conservative and only in the highest and most giltedged securities. The board of directors is composed of C. J. Rixey, S. C. Chancellor, J. T. Jones, G. B. Sinclair, H. C. Michie, R. F. Marshall, C. M. Bolton, C. H. Walker, H. M. Lewis, E. P. Duncan, and Bartlett Bolling. They are all prominently identified with the business interests of our thriving little community, and stand high in the esteem and confidence of the public. Mr. C. J. Rixey, president of the bank, has been engaged in banking and financial affairs all his life, and is one of the best known financiers in the State. Mr. Sinclair, the vice president, is a native of this city, and was reared and educated here. He is a graduate of law, with the degree of B. L. He has been practicing law here for a number of years, and is one of the leading members of the bar. He takes an active interest in local and financial enterprises. Mr. Peyton, the cashier, was born in Albemarle County, and has lived here for a number of years. For sixteen years, prior to accepting his present place, he held a responsible position in the local postoffice, and was one of the Government's most trusted employes. Home of the "Gibson Girls." To tell of all the famous people who have and do live in Albemarle County would fill a very respectable looking book. In former articles we have mentioned the names of scores of celebrities, who have made this grand old spot amid the hills and dells their abode. This is the home of Mr. Chiswell D. Langhorne the father of Mrs. Waldorf Astor formerly Mrs. Nannie Langhorne-Shaw. Mrs. Astor we all know recently married the son and heir of William Waldorf Astor, the great millionaire. She is another of Mr. Langhorne's beautiful daughters made famous by the celebrated artist Charles Dana Gibson in his "Gibson Girl" pictures. Mr. Langhorne reside on his estate at Mirador near Greenwood. H. W. Tribble, D D, President of Rawlings Institute. Herewith is shown the cut of the side entrance of Rawlings Institute, Charlottesville's school for young ladies, and also cut of the president. This school is well known by its success as one of the best schools in the State. The faculty is strong and the attendance is overflowing. For catalogue and other information address H. W. TRIBBLE, President. Bank of Albemarle. The State of Virginia has for years been noted for the stable condition of the financial institutions within its confines and among them none is built upon a firmer or more solid basis or enjoys a wider or a better reputation than the Bank of Albemarle, a leader in its line in our thriving little city. The building occupied by this stanch concern is located on East Main street, and recent improvements make it one of the most finely fitted and inviting in the city. The company was organized and granted a State charter in 1883, and opened for business the same year. From the start it had the confidence of the people, and today has as large a list of depositors and does as large a business as any similar concern in the State. The sates in which the books and money are kept are the latest burglar and fire proof patents, fitted with time locks and arranged in such a manner that it would be impossible to enter them by force without arousing the entire city. The officers of the company are L. T. Hanckel, president; S. V. Southall, vice-president; C. D. Fishburn, cashier, and R. T. Martin, teller, while the board of directors are: J. D. Jones, S. V. Southall, L. T. Hanckel, J. B. Wood, J. D. Watson, R. T. W. Duke, and George W. Morris. All of them are men of sterling character and imbued with the highest ideals of business principles. Mr. L. T. Hanckel, president of the bank. is one of the most prominent insurance men of Charlottesville. He is the Secretary and Treasurer of the Charlottesville Woolen Mills and a Vestryman of the Protestant Episcopal Church. Mr. Fishburne, the cashier, is a native of Augusta county having been born and reared there. He was educated at Washington College, now the Washington and Lee University and graduated with a degree of B. L. At the opening of the war he enlisted in the Rockbridge Artillery which became a portion of Cabell's battalion of artillery and served with distinction until the surrender. He then began practice here and continued until the opening of the bank. The other gentlemen, with the exception of Messrs. Wood and Watson, (who are merchants,) are attorneys and with the exception of Mr. Wood are graduates of the University of Virginia. The Colonial Hotel. Just opposite the courthouse within two blocks of the very heart of our business center, and yet far enough away to free it from the disagreeable noises and sounds which accompany the rush of trade and traffic is the Colonial Hotel, a hostelry of which our citizens are justly proud, and which is famous from Maine to California, and from the Great Lakes to the Gulf. The building is a three story substantial brick structure, built in the old colonial style and is one of the handsomest edifices in the city. The first floor is utilized for office and sample rooms, kitchen and dining rooms while he upper floors are for guests. The rooms are furnished in the most modern manner and are bright, cheerful and airy. A large corps of maids are employed and the bed linen is changed daily. The house affords all modern conveniences being lighted by gas, heated by steam, and has baths and lavatories on every floor. It is operated strictly on the American The Colonial Hotel. plan and the prices range from $2 to $3 per day, rooms being rented single or en suite and with or without private baths. The cuisine cannot be excelled by any hotel in the South, and the dining room service is as near perfection as it is possible to make it. The kitchen is fitted with all modern appliances for cooking and a chef of many years experience arranges the menus and presides over the force of cooks which prepares them. The hygienic conditions are perfect, and a cleaner place is not to be found. The building was erected in 1854, and was for many years known as the Farrish House. Three years ago Mr. J. L. Veal, one of the most experienced hotel men in the United States purchased the place and changed the name to its present one He thoroughly refurnished and renovated the place, and today it is one of the most modern in the South. Mr. Veal was born in 1854 in Atlantic County New Jersey, and after completing his education entered the hotel line with his father who had been engaged in it for years. For a long time he conducted the Prospect hotel at Atlantic City, New Jersey, and was one of the most popular bonifaces in that place. Under his management the Colonial's trade has been almost trebled and has been brought up to a high standard. Mr. Veal is prominent fraternally, being a member of the Improved Order of Red Men, Brotherhood of the Union and the Orders of United America Mechanics. Charlottesville Perpetual Building and Loan Company. Among the greatest benefits to any community are the building and loan associations, as they give men of moderate means an opportunity to own their homes and in such a manner that the small monthly payments are never missed. Of the institutions of this kind in the South none is more prominent or stands on a firmer financial foundation than the Charlottesville Perpetual Building and Loan Company. The offices of this thriving enterprise are located in rooms 1 and 2 People's National Bank building, and are in charge of Mr. Walter Dinwiddie one of the officers of the concern. This business was established twenty years ago. Its members are the most influential people in the city, although rich and poor are numbered among its patrons. The company was chartered in March, 1886, to do a general building and loan business, under the name of the Charlottesville Perpetual Building and Loan Company. It originally issued $50,000 in stock, and at the end of the sixth year issued $50,000 more. In 1896 another issue of $50,000 was made, running the total to $150,000. Ever since the first series were paid up the company has been paying par value for the stock. They are dealers in real estate, selling and renting houses and lots in desirable localities. In other words, general real estate is a feature of their business. Mr. Dinwiddie, who has held his present office for the past eight years, is well known in our business life. In addition to his connection with the Building and Loan Company he is local agent for the New York Life Insurance Company, one of the strongest in the world, and has placed many policies in this section for them. Since organization the company has loaned money to build and in many other ways helped to build property that has increased the assessable value of real estate in Charlottesville nearly $400,000. This in itself is a showing that cannot be excelled by any other institution in our community. The offices of the company are: President, H. M. Gleason; Vice-President, Col. Thomas S. Keller; Secretary and Treasurer, Walter Dinwiddie; Solicitor, Capt. Micajah Woods; Directors, Phil Leterman, F. B. Peyton, W. J. Keller, E. E. Dinwiddie, Dr. W. E. Norris, J. W. Fishburne, H. A. Dinwiddie, C. L. Lacey, M. Kaufman. The constitution and by-laws are most liberal and the rate of interest charged on loans is the lowest legal rate. Loans are made in sums from one hundred dollars up to very large amounts, and every borrower is guaranteed fair and square treatment, with none of the vexatious delays that usually accompany such transactions. Virginia Safe Deposit and Trust Corporation. A sound banking system is the backbone of any community, and in Charlottesville, considering the size of the city, we are well intrenched in this direction. The commercial and industrial status of a neighborhood can be judged by the condition of its banking institutions, and our city reveals a degree of prosperity most satisfactory to the level headed citizens and business men in general. Charlottesville Sure Enough Old Virginia Darkies, Uncle Jesse and Aunt Julia Scott, Servants on the Dickerson place, Cismont. has four banks, all of which are supported by a strong, healthy public sentiment. Among these is the branch of the Virginia Safe Deposit and Trust Corporation, whose headquarters are located at Alexandria, Va., and which is one of the soundest and strongest banking and trust institutions in Virginia. The business of this concern is expanding rapidly throughout the state, and the statements of its financial condition show that it has made wonderful progress. The Corporation is the successor of the Fidelity Saving and Trust Company which was incorporated in 1902 with a capital stock of $50,000, and since which time has been closely connected with the progress and development of the city. The bank has enjoyed a most satisfactory business from the start, offering as it does a secure and profitable place for the investment of the savings of the laboring man, the farmer, the mechanic, and the women and children. They can deposit their savings and have them accumulate at interest, until when its use becomes necessary, they have something ready at hand for a "rainy day". To those who have small amounts to deposit are given little iron banks which are taken to their homes, and any amount can be deposited. This method has often been the means of laying the foundation for what in the years that followed became a snug little fortune, or was that which established many in business in a small way to become greater as time passed on. This branch of the V. S. D. &amp; T. Corporation is located in the handsome Jefferson National Bank building, and has unsurpassed facilities for handling accounts of banks, corporations and individuals; has ample capital, its management is conservative and in the hands of a most excellent directory, composed of careful and successful representative business men. They have the benefit of the best legal advice, and among the various lines of business the organization is equipped and qualified to transact are the following: They act as executor, administrator, guardian, and trustee, and in other fiduciary capacities, and these accounts are kept seperate from other branches of their business, so that parties interested can at any time refer to the same. The bonding department is another important branch of their business. They issue fidelity, contract, official, judicial, and all other classes of bonds, and have agencies established in every city and county in the State of Virginia, and are doing a good business in this department. Safe Deposit boxes are for rent in their fire and burglar proof vaults, affording absolute protection of valuable papers, jewelry, &amp;c., from loss by fire or theft, and every convenience and safeguard surrounds this department. Wills are receipted for and kept without charge, thus providing against their loss after death of the maker. A general banking business is transacted and they pay interest at the rate of 3 per cent. per annum on deposits in their Savings Department. Loans are made at current rates of interest. High grade investment securities are constantly on hand, and for sale at market price. This corporation solicits large and small accounts, and persons contemplating making a change in their financial connections or who propose to open a new account will find the corporation a satisfactory bank to do business with. This corporation is one of a number of enterprises due to the efforts of Mr. C. Jones Rixey, who is now its president. Its authorized capital is $1,000,000, and up to the present time branches have been established in Gordonsville, Madison, Dillwyn, Lovingston, Remington, Culpeper, Herndon, Basic City, Charlottesville, and The Plains, Virginia. The home office of this chain of banking institutions is located at Alexandria, Va., and is one of the most imposing buildings in that city. People having business with this bank as well as strangers visiting it for the first time, are profuse in their admiration of the architectural beauty of this building. T. P. Carver Real Estate—Wholesale Coal. Among our citizens who pursue the occupation of real estate brokers with prosperity and success, and have earned a well-merited reputation for the conscientious and efficient manner in which they handle all interests intrusted to their hands, may be mentioned Mr. T. P. Carver who is well known to all our citizens. Mr. Carver brings to bear a wide practical experience Residence Planned and Erected by T. P. Carver. as a business man and a large and influential acquaintance, and is in a position to render the most valuable service to the public. He is an expert on land values, and was here when most of the city plots were laid out and has a personal knowledge of their exact worth. As a real estate broker he transacts a general real estate business, buying selling, leasing and exchanging properties, collecting house and ground rents and buying and selling property of all kinds. Upon his books are full descriptions of the most eligible bargains available in farm lands, city lots, dwellings, stores, etc., and conservative investors who rely upon his sound judgment and judicious advice can secure a steady income with prospective increase in value. He has at all times some of the very best and choicest farm lands in the county for sale or exchange, and he is the one to see before all others by those in search of anything in the real estate line. Mr. Carver's office is located in the Rosser Building (old postoffice building) corner of Main and Second streets. He is a native of Albemarle county and was in the coal business in this city for fifteen years. At the present time he is agent for several leading coal shippers and from him may be had at a short notice and the most reasonable prices all the very best grades of bituminous and anthracite coal. An Italian by the name of Manoni some forty years ago kept a confectionery store where Rhoads &amp; Kurtz now conduct the "Monticello Saloon" corner of Jefferson and Fifth streets. Later ex-Sheriff W. Rice Burnley kept an auction store there. Always have distinguished friends. Never have fools or never-do-wells for associates. They are of no use. J. E. White—The Land Man. The fertile lands, the healthy climate and the excellent water afforded is attracting thousands of home seekers to our prosperous County and City. While the major portion come from the Northern and middle West States, there is a sprinkling from every section and the real estate agents are having a hard time filling the demand as many of those fortunate enough to own property here do not desire to sell. Of the men engaged in the real estate line in Charlottesville, Mr. J. E. White is undoubtedly the leader and has one of the largest lists of desirable property in the State. He occupies a handsomely fitted suite of offices at No. 4, Early Building, and as "White, The Land Man," his name and fame extends over the entire South. He does a general real estate business, buying, selling and renting farm lands, city and suburban sites, and in fact property of every description, improved and unimproved. He makes a specialty of real estate and enjoys a large patronage. Mr. White was born in Albemarle County and received his early education in the schools of this section. He then entered Sadler's Commercial College at Baltimore and graduated with high honors. After completing his course there Mr. White returned to this city where he remained a year. At the age of twenty he went to Sedalia, Mo., where he remained for three months and then went to Colorado where he accepted a position with the firm of Carlisle and Weitbric, railroad contractors and remained with them until they had completed 165 miles of road for the Rio Grande and Southern and then imbued with an The Historic Cabell House. ambition to open a business of his own he went to Marshall, Mo., and entered the real estate line. He remained there for ten months and at the expiration of that time was severely injured. He was forced to abandon business and returning home underwent a severe operation. After recovering as he thought, he went to Pan Handle, Texas, and entered the real estate line with his brother, Mr. C. H. White. The business grew to extensive proportions and they engineered many large transactions in Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, Kansas, Missouri and other States in that section. During his stay in the Western Country Mr. White was land agent for a number of railroads and was in charge of their land departments. After being there three years he discovered that he could not regain his health, in that Country and returned home, more for health than business. During the eighteen months he has been here his health has improved wonderfully and as he describes it Virginia is good enough for him to live and die in. April the 1st, 1905, he established his present enterprise and now controls a business with which no one in his line here can compare. His long experience has been of inestimable value to him and no man in the Old Dominion is better posted on realty than he and many of the large transactions in that line have been made through him. While Mr. White is a young man he is thoroughly familiar with his business and has few peers and no superiors in his profession. As a man of sterling character and exceptional business ability he has a most enviable reputation and is held in the highest esteem by all who have had dealings with him. He is a liberal, progressive and public spirited citizen who is ever ready and willing to lend a helping hand towards any cause that is for the welfare of old Charlottesville, the town of his adoption, his home, and the little city in which he has cast his fortune. The Cabell House. One of the best known boarding houses in Charlottesville is located at No. 852 West Main street, just one block west of Union Station. Convenient to the business section of the city. Electric cars stop at the door. About five minutes' walk to the University. The Cabell House gives the best homelike comforts at reasonable rates. This house has been thoroughly renovated, newly papered and neatly furnished throughout. Large commodious dining room, which will seat about fifty people, fronting a beautiful green lawn. The rooms in this hotel are large and airy, everything about the premises is scrupulously clean, and the guests receive the best attention. It is conducted by Miss Pattie J. Daffan, and her two nieces Misses Nannie G. and Dora L. Shelkett. What is now the Municipal building or City Hall and Police Headquarters was occupied before the civil war by the old Merchants &amp; Farmers bank, and the vaults may still be seen in City Treasurer Walker's office. Later it became the residence of Dr. John Thornley, a retired naval officer. The old three-story red brick house on the North West corner of Jefferson and McKee streets was formerly the post-office and a bank, and later the residence of Dr. A. Robert McKee, a Justice of the Peace whose strange rulings and decisions caused much comment. ARTHUR WHITE. NOT the least picturesque occupation practiced in Charlottesville is the making of horses into hunters. To take a two hundred dollar horse and by instructing him in the art of carrying himself and his rider over fences, walls and ditches, to turn him into a five hundred or thousand dollar timbertopper, requires a peculiar knack that comparatively few men possess, although many enjoy using the finished product in fox or drag hunting. One of the most successful engaged in this rather strenuous occupation is Mr. Arthur White. Those in the picture, from left to right are: Mr. Frank Hough, on Highflier; Mrs. White, on Huntsman; Mr. Kenneth Brown, on Grey Boy; Miss Marion Farish, on Lucky; Mr. Arthur White, on Birdwood; Miss Carrie Randolph, on Tatnall; Master Payne, on Robert of Lincoln. Last fall and winter he acted as M. F. H. of the Charlottesville Hunt Club and laid many interesting drags over the country around town. During the summer, he, with Mrs. White, Arthur Jr., and several friends, may be seen any afternoon starting out for a cross country ride along the foot of Carter's Mountain, where the stone walls of the old Ficklin farm induce green horses to jump high and safe. Mr White always has some ten or twelve horses in his stables, from the raw beginner that needs the persuasive hands of the master, to the finished product who will teach the green rider what the latter does not know himself about the fascinating sport of foxhunting. "Albemarle Pippins" PANTOPS. IN THE heart of Old Virginia, about a mile east of Charlottesville "as the crow flies," or by the road which bends to cross the bridge over the Rivanna, about two miles—you come to the gate of Pantops. History links the place with the names of George Rogers Clark, whose father was one of the original grantees in 1734, and of Thomas Jefferson who bought it some years later, whose birthplace, "Shadwell," is two miles farther east, and his home, "Monticello," south just across the river. Mr. Jefferson himself gave the unique name, choosing it from Homeric Greek—"all seeing" because of its extensive view. For twenty-five miles one way, and twenty or more the other, the fairest part of Albemarle lies before the eye, rolling field, forest and meadow, the nestling town, the stately domes of the University, the rising ranges of hills, and the immense stretch of the grand Blue Ridge, its exquisite line cut against the bluest sky. And this beauty is but the expression of perfect physical conditions. This region is marked upon the United States statistical maps as "absolutely free from malaria." It is elevated, yet not so high as to have too rarified air, while the sheltering ridge gives it an equable climate, free from the severe winds of farther north and west. The official report for the county gives a mean annual temperature 55 degrees; for summer months 72 degrees, and for winter months 35.8 degrees. While ice is gathered, and there is an occasional week of skating, a record as low as 10 degrees is very unusual. The country around is rolling, the famous "red land" of Albemarle, in the Piedmont, is noted for its stock and fruit farms. Charlottesville is reached by two main lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, with thirty passenger trains daily. It is three hours from Richmond and three from Washington City. For twenty-six years there has been conducted here a successful school for boys. Pantops Academy, whose catalogue shows representation in twenty-eight States from Massachusetts to Texas, from Florida to California, besides Canada, Cuba, Mexico, Brazil, Germany, Japan, China, Persia and Siam. Though it is still at the height of its prosperity, the Principal has given it up, for reasons connected with his family. For a school or a hunting club, the large buildings would be PANTOPS.—A beautiful historic estate. Once owned by George Rogers Clark and Thomas Jefferson. Excellent for school, fine for a hunting club, unsurpassed for a gentleman's residence. Valuable; but as they have always kept a homelike appearance, they could be adapted to a private residence. There are three large two-story buildings: one (brick) with sixteen rooms beside a large central hall 32×32, which could be divided, as it has five large windows; another (frame) has twenty rooms; still another (frame) has fifteen; all have cellars and attics; they are heated by steam, and most of the rooms are also arranged for open fireplaces. Six porches, three bath rooms, with seven tubs and two showers beside. The kitchen has a large range and baking ovens, and sink with hot and cold water. The outhouses are a seven-room cottage (with porches) for servants; two five-room cottages (with porches) for farm manager and gardener; two large barns, stables, sheds, silo, ice-house (with two rooms over it), smoke-house, etc.; a large gymnasium and bowling alley. Pantops Mountain Spring Water. Professor Dunnington says in his analysis of July 5th, 1905: "This is an exceedingly pure drinking water." Dr. agruder says: "In my opinion no better, safer, more wholesome nor more palatable drinking water can be found in Virginia. I use it daily in my family." Dr. Browning, president of the Martha Jefferson Sanatorium, says: "I regard the Pantops Mountain Spring Water a pure, first class drinking water, free from any source of contamination. It is used exclusively in the Martha Jefferson Sanatorium and in my home." Office: Cor. Market and 5th Streets, Phone 260. SEABROOK BROS. Pluck, energy and ambition are the corner stones upon which every fortune and successful enterprise is built, and the young man of today who is imbued with these can reach the top just as easily as did those who now rest securely upon the pinnacle of success. A noticeable incident which verifies this can be found in Seabrook Bros., the leading photographers of our city today. About two years ago these young men came to this place total strangers, but adepts in their art, and filled with ambition and determination to become leaders in their profession. They first rented a furnished studio over the bank of Albemarle, and began business on a small scale and a modest manner. This studio had at one time enjoyed a very exclusive patronage, but in recent years the quality of its work had fallen so far below its former standard, it was then barely paying expenses. The studio itself was in a most dilapidated and run down condition, and the furniture and accessories much the worse for years of service. In the face of such adverse circumstances the new proprietors never wavered. The splendid quality of their work, and their excellent business methods soon brought a large and growing patronage. At the end of one year their trade had grown to such an extent that they found the rented studio entirely inadequate. They then determined to secure new quarters, and equip a studio which would be not only a credit to themselves, but to the citizens of Charlottesville as well, and make it a place more in keeping with the class of patrons their work had attracted. They leased a handsome suite of apartments on the second and third floors of 403 East Main street. Even here it was necessary to build an operating room, and at their own expense this room was constructed at a cost of several hundred dollars. It was put up according to the most modern ideas, and is one of the finest in the state. During the recent convention of photographers of Va., N. C. and S. C., which met in this city, several prominent artists examined the skylight, and pronounced it not only modern in every respect, but one under which any style of lighting could be quickly and easily made. They fitted the new studio most elaborately, purchasing the finest accessories and appliances to be had, and today their studio is not only the largest and most complete in the city, but is the handsomest by far. They do a general line of photographic work, including pastel, water color, crayon and enlarging, making a specialty of the highest class of work. They also carry a select line of picture moulding and do a large Ernest P. Seabrook. business of this kind. Another prominent department of their business to which they devote a great deal of time, and in which they have a most flattering trade, is the handling of a large and select stock of hand cameras, and a full supply of plates, films, and other photo supplies needed by amateur photographers. They have the largest business in the city in finishing work for amateurs, and make a feature of doing it neatly and promptly. In addition to the local place, they also operate a branch studio at Orange, Va., where they have a large and flourishing business. The firm is composed of E. P. and J. T. Seabrook, brothers, and two more experienced and expert photographers are not to be found in the Old Dominion. Mr. E. P. Seabrook was born at McDowell, Va., and Mr. J. T. Seabrook, the younger member of the firm was born at Seneca, S. C. After leaving school, he entered the studio of S. L. Alderman, of Greensboro, N. C., one of the leading photographers of the South, and there learned the business under a most able master. He confines himself exclusively to portrait work, and that he is proficient in his art, one is convinced after examining the character of the work on exhibition at the studio. He takes great delight in his work, and numbers among his patrons the most prominent people in the city and county. Mr. E. P. Seabrook attends to the outside work, and much of the beauty of the pictures are due to his artistic ideas of taking views. He learned the business at the studio of Mr. H. P. Cook, in Richmond Va., a photographer who specializes on outside work of every description, thus he has had the opportunity of perfecting himself in a way in which the average photographer who does both the outside work, and the portrait work, has not been favored. He has made pictures of prominent homes all over this section of the country, and has also made views of historic places in the city and county for people at a distance. In every case this work has given universal satisfaction. Both are public spirited and progressive citizens who are ever willing to lend a helping hand towards any cause that is for the welfare of old Charlottesville, J. T. Seabrook. the town of their adoption, their home and the little city in which they have cast their fortunes. When the Progress decided to get out a special edition of Charlottesville and Albemarle County, the first steps taken by the management was to secure the services of these photographers to make all the pictures necessary to illustrate these pages. This in itself not only speaks well for their standing, but the excellent manner in which all the pictures were finished, is a glowing testimonial to their ability as expert photographers. The Jefferson School For Boys. In looking over the educational field of this vicinity we unhesitatingly pronounce the Jefferson School for Boys to be one of the very best in Virginia, both as regards accomodation, improvements, scope and character of education imparted, rapid progress under a competent staff of teachers, and for its pupils a well grounded certainty of not only being fitted for securing renumerative employment after graduation but of being thoroughly prepared also for any course of college instruction. There is an evident need in this city for a high class school for boys, and the exceptional climate of Charlottesville makes it a most desirable location for a school, which can offer to boys from the colder states a home in a land of comparatively mild winters, and to boys from the states further south the bracing atmosphere of the unsurpassed Piedmont region of the Blue Ridge. The purpose of the Jefferson School for Boys. school is simple: To make men; to train the boys entrusted to it and develop them into the most effective men, the very best men that their natures allow. This training takes a varied form, dependent upon whether the boy is to be fitted for business or for a profession, and in all cases is guided by the individuality of the pupil. Only those methods approved by the best modern pedagogy are employed, and every class in the school is under the constant supervision of the Headmaster. The latter has had the experience of nearly ten years of teaching, from the lower grammar grades through the senior courses of the University; and to this has been added a painstaking technical study of the best modern methods, so that no effort is spared to make the training offered by the school as complete as are the demands of our progressive age. Professor E. Reinhold Rogers, M. A., Ph. D., is a graduate of the University of Virginia, class of 1899, and is an educator of the highest attainments. He possesses marked educational and executive ability. He is a native of Petersburg, Va., and a gentleman of the highest standing in the community. The halls of the old mansion in which the school is located are spacious and well equipped, and are fully supplied with every necessity for carrying out the system of instruction. Students can always rely upon receiving a good academic education here, one far superior to that afforded elsewhere in this vicinity, yet acquired at a very moderate cost. A visit from educators parents and guardians is welcomed by the school. L. H. Dollins—Covington. This is pre-eminently the age of electricity, and this subtle and powerful force of nature is in always widening circles being harnessed and utilized in the service of and for the benefit of mankind. Hence the expert electrician is a man who ought to be given a place on the roll of honor in the business life of any community, for he can do much to make things go round and prosper. He is, as it were, the life and soul in the realms of its mechanical world where applied electrical power plays the leading part. In and around Charlottesville, Covington, Albemarle and the counties adjoining there is no more skilled and able electrician, than Mr. L. Hall Dollins who for seven years was connected with the Electric Power Company of Charlottesville, and now has an office of his own in Covington, making a specialty of the installation of electric power plants both for motor and lighting purposes. He has facilities L. Hall Dollins. for undertaking and promptly executing all contracts, large or small, and all work done by him is guaranteed. Mr. Dollins is a native of Charlottesville and received his early education at the local schools. After seven years work in all the departments of the electric plant here he established himself one year ago in Covington. Conservatories of Gordon &amp; King. Gordon &amp; King. There are but few callings which offer to their successful followers so many unalloyed pleasures as that of the florist. In the front rank of those most actively engaged in it in Charlottesville stands the old and reliable firm of Gordon &amp; King whose conservatory is located at 115 Fourteenth street N. W., University Station. The greenhouses are fitted up with everything requisite for the successful cultivation of flowers and plants including the latest improved heating apparatus whereby an equable temperature is maintained throughout all seasons.

The trade is very extensive and extends from New York to Alabama and well it should grow and continue to increase for it is well worthy of the splendid patronage it receives. All days come that are to be.—Dickens. Maphis, Shaw &amp; Offley. There are two things which should be considered essential by every man, insurance and real estate: one provides indemnity in the event of calamity— the other, either a home or an income, or, if extensive enough, both. Of the firms in our city engaged in these lines, one of the most prominent is that of Maphis, Shaw &amp; Offley, who occupy a handsomely fitted suite of offices in rooms 2 and 4, Law Building. The firm does a general line of insurance— fire, life, accident, health, boiler and liability—while under the title of the "Southern Land Company" Messrs. Maphis and Shaw conduct a large real estate business. In the insurance line they represent the Prudential and the following Fire Insurance Companies: the German Alliance, Glens Falls, Milwaukee Mechanics, National Union of Pittsburg, North British and Mercantile, North River, Philadelphia Underwriters, Prudential of Tazewell, Republic, Scottish Union and National, United States, and Western Assurance. They control the agencies of the Ocean Accident Corporation, the Maryland Casualty Company, and the United States Casualty Company. All of these companies are recognized leaders, and are among the most substantial from a financial point of view in the world. Many large policies have recently been placed in this section by this firm, and they are rapidly building up an extensive business. Only one Agency in this city represents a greater number of companies, and in strength of companies their Agency is surpassed by none in this State. In the real estate line they buy, sell, and rent property of all descriptions and make a specialty of mineral and timber lands. Their Property List is a most comprehensive one and contains many bargains in the realty market. The members ef this firm are Charles G. Maphis, John H. Shaw, and Edward H. Offley, and they are all men of energy and sterling business character. The company was organized in 1904 by Messrs. Maphis and Shaw, and has recently been enlarged and strengthened by the purchase of the real estate and insurance interests of Mr. C. R. Randolph and the addition of his partner, Mr. Offley, to the Insurance Department of the firm. They have already made many of their older competitors look to their laurels Mr. Maphis was born in Shenandoah County and has resided in this city about fifteen years. He has long been prominently identified with educational work in this State and has recently been appointed by the State Board of Education, Examiner and Inspector of Schools for the Fifth District of Virginia, which comprises twenty counties and in importance is second only to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. He was for many years Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, and has always been an earnest worker in any movement calculated to advance the interests of his town and State. Mr. Shaw is a native of Canada, and came to this city two years ago from Minnesota, where he had resided many years. He has impressed himself upon the community as a man of fine business capacity. Mr. Offley was born in the Indian Territory, of a family long prominent in the Army and Navy, and came here about two years ago from Texas and the Pacific Coast. All these gentlemen are prominently identified with fraternal affairs: they are liberal, public spirited, and progressive citizens, and are ever ready and willing to lend a helping hand towards any cause that is for the welfare of Charlottesville, the town of their adoption, their home, and the city in which they have cast their fortunes. There is no firm in the city that is more progressive, enterprising and at the same time safe and conservative than this one. They will not only attend carefully to any business intrusted to them, but will be found safe counsellors as well. ARCHIBALD DOUGLAS DABNEY. Commonwealth Attorney. Prosecuting Attorney Dabney is quite a young man, and great credit is due him when full consideration is given to what he has accomplished in his profession, and the great responsibilities that now rest upon him. He is the son of the late W. D. Dabney, professor of Law at the University of Virginia, where the subject of this sketch received the degree of Bachelor of Law. Mr. Dabney is of the well known law firm of Dabney &amp; Fowler, and he is Commonwealth Attorney for the city of Charlottesville, an Ex-member of the City Council and former United States Commissioner. As a young lawyer he speedily acquired distinction and it was not long before his talents caused him to outgrow the restricted limits of ordinary civil practice. He had the faculty of grasping and comprehending in the most minute manner the details of all that was most essential in both civil and criminal jurisprudence, and imbibing almost intuitively the intricacies of the laws. Arrowhead Stock Farm. Arrowhead Farm, the home of Samuel B. Woods, in the North Garden neighborhood, is one of the noted places on the Southern Railway. It is situated amid scenery strikingly beautiful and picturesque. The highest mountains in Albemarle, rugged and bold, covered with forests, tower above valleys green with grass fields and rich in growing crops. On the mountain sides are fields of blue grass with ample shade and numerous springs of the purest sparkling water, which keeps a temperature of 50 degrees even in midsummer, and up here a handsome herd of Red Polled cattle find an ideal home from April to December. From one of these springs, over 600 feet above the residence, shaded by a mighty poplar and walnut, water is piped to the farm below, and in quality is like most of these mountain springs of Piedmont, Virginia, "the best in the world." The orchards, at "Arrowhead," form one of the notable features of the place. On the mountain are the Albemarle pippins Offices of Maphis, Shaw &amp; Offley. and comet peaches, and on the lower fields red apples, pears and many varieties of peaches. These trees have been most carefully planted, and no matter where you go in the orchard they line up as spokes radiate from the center of a wheel. They have been skillfully pruned, sprayed and cultivated, and are thrifty, symmetrical and beautiful. The fruit from these young orchards have repeatedly taken prizes, medals and diplomas at various shows and expositions. Mr. Woods, who for eleven years has been President of the Virginia State Horticultural society, is greatly interested in fruit growing, and has large interests in this industry. His methods of growing large orchards in an economical way are radically different from old methods, but they are successful, and beautiful fruit is being borne on trees grown at a minimum cost. The stock raised at Arrowhead is pure bred and registered. The Shetland ponies, often seen from the car windows, are a delight to the children passing by as well as to children at Arrowhead. Horses are no longer raised on the farm, other stock being found more profitable. Red Polled cattle, the great milk, butter and beef breed, has been adopted and the herd now numbers up in the seventies. The calves run with their mothers and get all the milk where they can take it all, and often weigh 500 and 600 lbs at five and six months of age. These calves readily bring from $55 to $100 apiece, according to sex, and very few ever stay to be a year old on the farm. The latest addition to the herd is "Ruths International" No—, prize animal, whose sire and dam have both been great prize-winners, the dam taking a first prize at the International Show both for quantity and quality of milk. There is a fine crop of calves at Arrowhead this spring by this splendidly bred bull, averaging as well as any we have ever seen. The Red Polls are a beautiful sight, grazing together on the mountain side, smooth, blocky, handsome, gentle, a solid rich red in color and uniform in appearance. The Poland China hogs are raised at this farm and among the herd are the sons and daughters, all registered, of the greatest prizewinners in the country, hogs that have sold from $2,500 to $7,000 each. The Poland China is the triumph of American skill in breeding, it has now the fine grained flesh and heavy hams of the best pork breeds, while for the same amount of feed it will produce more meat than any of them. A fine flock of registered Dorsets are kept at Arrowhead because they are the best for early lambs, and this is where the money lies for the southern sheep raiser. They also yield splendid mutton and good heavy fleeces of wool, but in this respect are no better than some of the down breeds. Pure bred poultry is raised, the celebrated "Ringlets" of the Barred Plymouth Rocks, and a few white Brahmas and White Holland Turkeys are on the mountain, and Mammoth Bronze down below. For years the Bronze Flock at Arrowhead has been noted as one of the best in the United States, gobblers weighing from 45 to 51 lbs have been raised, and both gobblers and hens have taken prizes at Madison Square Garden and other poultry shows. The birds sell from $5.00 to $10.00, and eggs for 50 cents each. An account of this farm would be very incomplete without a notice of the seed corn department. For years Mr. Woods has been growing Albemarle Prolific seed corn, a variety gotten from a mixture of Cocke's Prolific, flint and Virginia Dent. This corn has yielded as much as 1631-4 bushels (shelled gram) to the acre at Arrowhead. It is a great grower of fodder, and the best for ensilage aswell as for grain. Some of the largest crops ever grown in the Valley, and in Ohio, Illinois and other great corn growing States have been made with Albemarle Prolific. It has been equally successful in the South, last year taking first place in the tests of the Georgia experiment station. The crop is cut with a harvester, shucked and shredded with a machine. Corn is then picked over and shelled for seed, and the shredded fodder fed with molasses and cotton seed meal to the stock. Arrowhead farm has demonstrated that farming pays in old Virginia. Everything is conducted, not for show, or for appearance, but for the practical good there is in it from a business standpoint. Year by year the fertility of the soil is being increased by deep plowing and the use of the manure spreader, and occasionally some permanent improvement, like the big Ohio barn goes up, which adds to the economy of the administration. The Albemarle Orchard Company owns the largest orchard in the State. The company has now about 1500 acres of land, and has planted nearly seventy thousand trees, principally comet peaches and Albemarle pippins. About 600 acres of the orchard have been cleared from the forest and planted. Some of these trees have begun to bear, and last summer experimental shipments of these mountain grown peaches were shipped to Londan, England, carrying in perfect condition and bringing satisfactory prices. On some of the young apple trees fine fruit has already been gathered, which has been awarded first premiums and diplomas at different exhibition. The improvements which the company has put up are modern, up-to-date and attractive. The officers are Samuel B. Woods, president; Wm. B. Morgan, secretary, and E. L. Douglass, superintendent. James Perley &amp; Sons. For many years the name of Perley has been connected with everything that is the best in the furniture line in this city and the mammoth establishment occupied by James Perley &amp; Sons is the best testimonial of the enormous business they enjoy. The structure is at 100 to 108 West Main street and is one of the largest and Handsome Warerooms of James Perley &amp; Sons finest in the city being of iron, three stories in height and containing over 54,000 square feet of floor space, and a large warehouse with 7,344 additional square feet has just been completed. J. Vincent Perley—James Perley—J. W. Perley. The company does a wholesale and retail business in the furniture line, and handle everything that comes under the catalogue of furniture. They also do a general undertaking business and are as well equipped for this work as any concern in the country. In addition to carrying a full line of wooden, cloth and metallic caskets, shrouds and robes, the company has four rubber tired hearses of the finest design and pattern, and a fine ambulance and casket wagon. All of the firm members are registered embalmers having graduated from Professor Clark's School of Embalming in Cincinnati, Ohio. They are assisted in this branch of their business by Mr. Bryant, also a registered embalmer and one of the best known and most experienced undertakers in the South. In the furniture line their trade extends over Albemarle, Greene, Fluvanna and Nelson Counties and is growing more expansive rapidly. The present business grew from a most modest beginning having been started as a repair shop in 1855, Mr. Jas. Perley, founder and head of the firm who was born in Alexandria, Virginia, July 2, 1833, and came to Charlottesville with his parents in 1841. He was educated here and after completing his studies entered the mercantile line. In 1855, he determined to open a place for himself and engaged in the furniture repairing line. At the opening of the war he enlisted as a corporal, and was promoted Sergeant, in the Monticello Guards, which was mustered into the Confederate service as Company A. Nineteenth Virginia Infantry, and served with bravery and distinction in the many notable battles in which his company participated. Just prior to the close of the war he was taken prisoner at the battle of Harper's Ferry and was held a prisoner until June 1865. After his release he returned to this city, and in 1866 opened a furniture store under the style of James Perley. In four years his business had increased to such an extent that his quarters were far too small for him and he secured his present location in 1874. He admitted his sons, J. V., J. W. and C. M. into the firm in 1891, and the style was changed to the present one. Later Mr. C. M. Perley died and there are now but three partners in the concern. The elder Mr. Perley is a prominent Mason. Both of the sons were born in this city and Mr. J. V. Perley is one of the most prominent fraternal men in the South, being a member of forty-two organizations and treasurer of thirteen. He has just returned from a trip to Egypt and the Holy Lands. Mr. J. W. Perley is an Odd Fellow, and belongs to the Encampment and the Rebekas. THE KING LUMBER COMPANY Contractors and Builders. The King Lumber Co. was organized here in March, 1899, with W. W. King as president and G. P. McNeill, secretary and treasurer. Mr. King had been in the contracting business here for some fifteen years previous, and had erected many handsome buildings, notably the new buildings at the University of Virginia after the THE VALLEY NATIONAL BANK OF STAUNTON, VA. Erected by the King Lumber Company. fire of 1895. Mr. McNeill is from the long-leaf pine section of North Carolina and is thoroughly acquainted with its manufacture. The Company bought the old Wheeler place on the line of the Southern Railroad and Preston Ave., converted it into a lumber yard with warehouse and sheds, and carry a large stock of rough and dressed lumber of all kinds. In 1896 they erected their present mill building and put in a full line of machinery for the manufacture of building material, and they carry in stock regular sizes of sash, doors, blinds and general builders' supplies. They are general contractors as well as dealers, and though seeking large contracts for public buildings and business blocks, are in position to undertake all classes of work. Among the many fine buildings recently erected by this firm we will mention the following notable examples: The Jefferson National Bank building, at Charlottesville; The National FARMERS &amp; MERCHANTS BANK OF WINCHESTER, VA. Erected by the King Lumber Company. Valley Bank building, at Staunton, Va., probably one of the handsomest bank buildings in the State; The Farmers' &amp; Merchants' National Bank building, at Winchester, Va.; The Fauquier National Bank building, at Warrenton, Va.; The Citizens' National Bank building, at Florence, S. C. They were also contractors for the handsome new schoolhouse building at Miller's School, the Masonic Temple, at Culpeper, Va., and Orange, Va.; The Peoples' National Bank building, at Manassas, Va.; The Jefferson Hotel, at Charles Town, W. Va.; United States Post Office building, at Goldsboro, N. C.; The $100,000.00 Courthouse and Post Office, at the largest church building at Staunton, the Mount Zion Baptist Church, and they are now at work on the handsome building for the Presbyterian Church at Maxton, N. C. All these buildings have been put up in the best manner, with all modern improvements. The recent extraordinary rise in the price of lumber and, in fact, all building material, will add somewhat to the cost of future work, but this Company's connections with the best manufacturers of the country will insure their securing every advantage possible, and anyone wishing the best class of work should communicate with them before making contracts. They accept work in any part of the country, and have a force of skilled workmen competent to undertake any kind of building. The King Lumber Company have long held a name for honesty, square dealing and splendid workmanship. When an order is given to this concern you may be sure that the work will be done just right and on time. They are among our most progressive and public spirited citizens and fully deserve the patronage of the people of Charlottesville. Charlottesville Bargain House. Charles E. Hughes. The word "bargain" has a pleasant sound to the ear of every shopper and the average woman will walk a mile to get something she deems a bargain. In Charlottesville however it is not necessary to walk very far for in the very heart of our business center we have a store which is fairly teeming with bargains. We refer to that large and handsome emporium, The Charlottesville Bargain House located at No. 412 East Main street. Here can be found everything that the ordinary mortal requires, and at a much lower price than they can be purchased elsewhere, though the goods and articles are equal in every respect, if not superior, to those sold for higher prices at other places. The building is a spacious one having a floor area of 7,500 square feet and containing as complete an assortment of goods as can be found in nearly any city. The company does a wholesale and retail business, and the stock comprises dry goods, millinery, fancy goods, shoes, hats, clothing, and all kinds of merchandise. The proprietor of this concern is Mr. Charles E. Hughes, and a more reliable or highly esteemed man is not to be found in our city. The store is under his direct personal supervision and he has surrounded himself with a corps of male and female clerks who are experts in the various lines in which they are assigned. In addition to the business described above, Mr. Hughes also owns a similar establishment at Louisa, Virginia known as the "Louisa Bargain House." Aside from these two interests he deals in railroad ties, piling, telephone and telegraph poles, sawed lumber, bark, sumac, etc. He also buys and sells timber rights and lands and has a splendid business in all these branches. Mr. Hughes was born in Albemarle County and has been engaged in the mercantile line for the past fifteen years. He moved to Charlottesville ten years ago and launched his present enterprise and made a success of the venture from the start. The majestic looking building with its twenty or more stone steps corner Main and Fourth Streets, was erected at great expense in 1854 as the home of the Monticello Bank and Albemarle Insurance Co. The Bank failed and many were the citizens who lost all their savings. J. B. ANDREWS. Virginia and especially this portion of it undoubtedly has a great future before it as a stock raising center. Though this industry is at present somewhat immatured, it is rapidly increasing and is being furthered by one of the most successful horse and cattle raisers in the entire South. We refer to our esteemed and popular townsman Mr. J. B. Andrews, the owner of Oak Grove and Buckeyeland Stock Farms. Since 1886 he has been engaged in the enterprise and now owns five of the most fertile and finely stocked farms in the county. He makes a specialty of Scotch short horn cattle and high grade hackneys and other horses. One of Mr. Andrews' farms is located on Ivy Creek about seven miles from this city, another at Crozet and three at Buckeyeland, comprising two thousand acres and the finest specimens of stock. At the head of his short horn cattle is the far famed "Orange Merchant," grandson of "Lavander Viscount," grand champion of America and one of the most famous short horn bulls in the world. An own sister of "Orange Merchant's" dam sold for $1,410 at E. S. Donshey's sale in 1902, and he is also related to "Orange Hero," sire of the highest priced lot of heifers sold in this country in fifteen years. Most of Mr. Andrews' cattle are registered, and few "NIGHTINGALE" A. H. S. B. 220. Sire Matchless Londesborough —— Dom Nitra A. Property of J. B. Andrews. herds in the country can compare with them. At the head of his horses is the famous sire "Nightingale," son of "Matchless of Landesborogh," an uncle of the famous "Forest King," twice winner of the Waldorf-Astoria cup and the champion harness horse of "America." Mr. Andrews' farms are well equipped with buildings for the housing of stock and attendants. No man in the State has done more for the advancement of stock raising or farming than Mr. Andrews, and all his friends are justly proud of the success his efforts have attained. In addition he has been shipping fancy bred horses to the New York market for the past twenty years, sending from one to two carloads yearly. Mr. Andrews is also a breeder of pure-bred and half-bred hackney horses, high-class carriage and saddle horses, polled, durham and shorthorn cattle, berkshire hogs, etc. Aside from this enterprise he has large orchards located at Crozet and Ivy Creek on which are 6,000 apple trees— mostly wine saps and Albemarle pippins. He is a large shipper of apples to Europe. At No. 215 West Main street he conducts a wholesale and retail grocery business, carrying a full line of staple and fancy groceries, fertilizers, grain, feed, seeds, meats and liquors for family and table use. While the store is very large, it is not adequate for the stock carried and the reserve goods are kept in a large warehouse on the C. &amp; O. tracks. The shipping and receiving facilities at this building are unsurpassed and cars can be unloaded in short order. Mr. Andrews is now secretary of the Electoral Board, and has been a member of it ever since Charlottesville was made a city. He is also vice-president of the Albemarle Telephone Company. He is an Odd Fellow and Heptasoph, and a wide awake public spirited citizen. H. K. Hawthorne &amp; Co. Almost every fortune of any great magnitude had its foundation laid in speculation and thousands have become wealthy in short order by some wise investment in stocks, bonds, etc. In Charlottesville there is quite a coterie of speculators, and the popular exchange H. K. Hawthorne. of Mr. H. K. Hawthorne affords them the best facilities. Mr. Hawthorne's offices are located in suite No. 11-12 old Post Office building and are handsomely fitted. A corps of expert operators and board markers are employed and large comfortable rocking chairs are provided for the accommodation of guests and patrons. The enterprise represents the Eunis &amp; Stoppani Company, of New York city, and V. P. Randolph, &amp; Co., Philadelphia, both members of the New York Stock Exchange, and are conceded to be among the leaders in the East. Private wires run direct from Mr. Hawthorne's place to the offices of the mentioned companies and every change is marked here a second or so after it has been recorded in New York. Mr. Hawthorne handles stocks, bonds, grains and cotton on a cash or margin basis and has a large patronage. Mr. Hawthorne was born in Alabama and was educated there. Four years ago he came to this city and entered the real estate line with Mr. Randolph under the firm name of MONTICELLO KENNELS, Located in Charlottesville are the famous Monticello Kennels, owned and conducted by Mr. A. M. Whitlock, a gentleman who has devoted many years to the study and breeding of Llewellen Setters and Pointers for the market. His dogs are all of the purest blood and are the direct descendents of the World Champion Count Gladstone IV, and Champion Rodfield. The dogs from these kennels generally win the prizes for their class at any bench show whereever exhibited. Randolph &amp; Hawthorne. He was quite successful in this, but January 1, 1905, decided to change his vocation and launched his present enterprise. He is a young man of splendid business ability and through his fair and honest treatment of patrons has won a high place in the opinion of the public. He is quite prominent in Masonie circles and is an Odd Fellow and member of the Knights of Pythias. Good news travels; not so rapidly as bad news, of course, but it travels. Do a good thing, and people will hear of it in time. E. Frank Fischer. Few arts have made greater advance in the last half century than photography, and to compare the magnificently finished work of today with the crude tin types and daguerreotypes of twenty five years ago is like comparing a ray of sunshine to the blackness of a dungeon. Of the photograghers of Charlottesville none is more expert or has a better trade than Mr. E. F. Fischer, who although only a newcomer here is already looked upon as a leader. Mr. Fischer's studio is located at 118 West Main Street and is one of the most finely furnished in the State, containing all the most modern and latest appliances necessary for getting the best results. He has a large and varied assortment of scenery for use as backgrounds and his artistic posing of subjects cannot be excelled. He does general work and his line of folders and mountings cannot be duplicated outside of the largest galleries in the Metropolitan cities. While doing both time, sitting and instantaneous work Mr. Fischer makes a speciality of time poses of infants and children and has a wide reputation for the excellence of his work in this branch. He also does pastel, water color and crayon work and is quite proficient in the art of enlarging pictures. In the way of outside views of prominent places he keeps a fine stock including "Monticello" Madison and Roosevelt homes. The subject of this sketch was born in Staunton, Augusta County, Virginia, and after leaving school entered the photo business in his native city. He was for a time with Bell, the famous artist of Washington. He was quite successful and remained there for several years. He then transferred operations to Norfolk where success again crowned his Residence of J. B. Andrews. efforts. Eighteen months ago he came here and opened a studio at 409 E. Main Street. He soon gained a wide reputation for the splendid quality of his work, and his trade grew so rapidly E. Frank Fisher. that he was forced to seek larger quarters and secured his present spacious suite. He is prominent fraternally being Lieutenant Commander in the Knights of the Maccabees and Musical Director in the Odd Fellows. Aside from his business Mr. Fischer is quite popular and stands high in the social world. The Late Prof. R. H. Rawlings. Founder of Rawlings Institute. To thy own self be true.

The Charlottesville and Albemarle railway has not only been the medium of furnishing rapid transportation to all the most important parts of the city but has been the means of greatly increasthe value of real estate in this section. The electric system has been in operation some six years and is the successor of the old horse car line that had been running for nine years prior to that time. The company owns about four miles of track, which runs from the foot of Main Street near the C. &amp; O. Depot along the entire length of this thoroughfare to the University of Virginia, where a branch runs to Fry's Springs, a well known summer resort whose healing waters are renowned far and wide, and where, also, is located the splendid Jefferson Park Hotel, which during the summer months is patronized with boarders from all sections of the country. The Jefferson is most elegantly fitted throughout. The sleeping rooms are large, ceilings high, with an abundance of light, sunshine, pure mountain air and perfect ventilation. The lawns are large with plenty of grand old trees, swings and shady nooks with hammocks. All around the hotel grounds are wild mountain woodlands and from the front porch and windows may be had an exquisite view of Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson, third President of the United States, and author of the Declaration of American Independence. The trolley line passes every important store in the city, all the leading hotels, the Auditorium, the Union Depot and in fact every thing of any real interest in Charlottesville. During the summer months five open cars are run and the merry voices and happy faces of the trolley parties to and from the park and springs show how much the rides are enjoyed and the line is appreciated.

The store is one of the largest and most attractive on that thoroughfare, and the stock carried comprises everything in the way of general merchandise, groceries, hay, grain, mill feed, etc. Only the best and purest grades are handled and the large trade enjoyed is the best evidence of the quality and the lowness of his prices.

The commodious plant of this company is located on the North side of the city. The building is a two-story brick with a floor space of 6,325 square feet, and is equipped with the most modern machinery, and improvements are being made as rapidly as the growth of the business warrants. The company devotes itself exclusively to the manufacture of overalls and coats of every grade. These goods have a wide reputation. The company has been in operation three years, was incorporated in the latter part of 1902, and like every new enterprise it experienced great difficulty in securing and training help. Its trade is steadily increasing. At present the plant gives employment to about 75 employees, and this force will be increased from time to time as necessity demands. The basis upon which the trade is being built is "NO SKIMPING," "Best Factory of the H. C. Marchant Manufacturing Company. Material," "Full Cut," and "HONEST MAKE;" to this idea of the President of the Company, who has always advocated the use of only the best grade of goods, is due the success the company has so far attained.

To have her bread and biscuits "the best" is the aim of every housewife, but in order to do so they must have the best flour, and those of this city are fortunate in this respect, having at their very doors the plant of the Brown Milling Company, whose output is conceded to have few peers and no superiors in the entire South. The plant of the company is located in East Main street, and is one of the most complete of its kind in the country. The main building is a five-story structure with a combined floor space of 13,440 square feet, and is fitted with the latest and most modern improved machinery known to the milling art.

Antonio Goncalvez, master of the the robes to Prince Henry of Portugal, in a voyage along the Morocco coast in the year 1441 captured a party of Moors and carried them away with him to Spain. The Moors did not like Portugal, and they told Goncalvez that if he would take them back to their native heath they would give him a ransom in the shape of negro slaves. Prince Henry, upon hearing of the proposition that had been made to Goncalvez, urged its acceptance on the ground that the Moors were a set of obstinate heretics, anyway, while the black men might possibly be converted to Christianity. Goncalvez, accordingly took the Moors back home and returned in the year 1442 with a cargo of negroes. And such was the beginning of the African slave trade. As early as 1445—three years after the Goncalvez episode—slave marts were opened in Africa, and the trade took on the activity which was to last for centuries. It is estimated that during the three hundred years from 1445 to 1745 at least 90,000,000 negroes were stolen from Africa and sold into slavery. By 1516 a steady stream of Africans was pouring into the New World to work in the Spanish and Portuguese mines, and in 1562 the Englishman. John Hawkins, made his first trip to the Gold Coast for the new merchandise. By 1786 England had one hundred and thirty vessels engaged in the slave trade. In the meantime, the fine climate of the South, aided by Ely's cotton gin, showed that there was money in raising cotton, and on this purely economic principle slavery, from being co-extensive with the Union at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, drifted southward. In the whole country negro slaves numbered in 1800, 697,897; 1810, 1,191,364; 1820, 2,009,731; 1850, 3,204,315; 1860, 4,002,996. Slavery in the British possessions was abolished in 1834, 720,280 slaves being freed, at a cost to the Government of 20,000,000 pounds sterling. However, Englishmen, Dutchmen, Americans and others continued selling slaves to Southern planters. In September, 1862, President Lincoln issued a proclamation to the effect that, on the following January 1st, he intended freeing the slaves in such States or parts of States as might then be found in hostility to the Government. He was as good as his word, and on New Year's Day, 1863, African slavery ceased to exist for ever in this country. It cost to free the negro the lives of a million men and some $10,000,000,000. In 1870 the Secretary of State, the Fifteenth Amendment having been duly ratified by the requisite number of States, announced by proclamation that the negro was a fulfledged American citizen. Rev. Thomas B. Gregory. W. H. Greaver.

Of the companies in this section who have attained a wide reputation in this business the Charlottesville Ice Company is the most prominent. In addition to its cold storage department the concern does a wholesale and retail business in coal and ice and has a large patronage in all its departments.

Both gentlemen are true American hustlers of the sturdy, honest type that make the backbone of any community. Fraternally Mr. Young is a prominent member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. Both partners are men whom we can recommend to all our citizens requiring their line of work. Samuel J. Robinson &amp; Bro. To be assured of getting fresh and pure meats and poultry at all times is certainly a boon to any community and in Charlottesville a firm which can be relied upon to give only the most pure and freshest goods is that of Market of Samuel J. Robinson &amp; Bro. Samuel J. Robinson &amp; Brother, at 228 and 230 West Main Street. These gentlemen conduct one of the most handsomely appointed meat markets in the city, and they have an exceedingly large custom.

Mr. S. J. Robinson, Jr., and his brothers, R. M. Robinson, and Harry Robinson, three of the best young meat cutters in the city attend to the wants of the numerous patrons and the trade, already a large one, is growing rapidly. The business was established in 1902 by Mr. Samuel J. Robinsen, Sr., and James T. Robinson, the present proprietors, and few of our business men are held in higher opinion by their fellow townsmen. Mr. S. J. Robinson was born in Albemarle County but early in life moved to Nelson, where he married and lived for about 20 years. He then purchased "Brook Hill Farm," once the home of Lord Pellum Clinton, four miles south of the city, and has recently bought a beautiful home on Belmont Avenue.

Mr. Burgess employs a force of twenty of the most capable paper hangers and painters to be found in this section, and the excellence of his work and material is best attested by the large business he enjoys.

Mr. Burgess was born in Albemarle County, and came to Charlottesville in 1889. In 1890 he opened his present establishment, and soon built up a splendid trade. He is one of the most enterprising and energetic young men in the city, and is highly esteemed by all our citizens. President James Monroe was for several years a citizen of Albemarle. His first purchase of real estate was made from George Nicholas in 1790. He later bought from him lots 17 and 18 in Charlottesville, with the stone house which Nicholas had erected thereon.

"Sim" may be seen any evening in Court House Square dreaming and talking with old cronies of memories of the past. Lyman Abbott, D. D. LL. D., the successor of Henry Ward Beecher, and noted New York divine often spends the summer in Albemarle County. The frame building occupied by Burnley &amp; Smith, corner Main and Fifth streets, was formerly the Old Virginia House, and it was from its balcony that Thomas Jefferson often addressed the people of Charlottesville. "You can always tell when a man has reached the limit of his possible development. He ceases to be discontented—or at least to show discontent actively. Contentment, apathy, are signs of decadence and of a career ended in either a man or a nation." L. O. Gianniny. A leading and representative house in its special line is the enterprise conducted by Mr. L. O. Gianniny at 611 West Main street.

One of the most popular resorts of recreation, and one well worthy of prominence and special mention in the pages of this edition devoted to the varied interests of Charlottesville, is the excellent pool and billiard parlor conducted by Mr. John S. La Rowe, located near the University of Virginia. After a day of toil, worry and mental fatigue what better way is there of spending a social hour or so with a few jovial and merry friends in the good old scientific games of pool or billiards. Mr. La Rowe is an authority on boxing, and had private boxing classes for twelve years for the students of the Virginia Military Institute. Mr. La Rowe's resort is the headquarters of many of the leading gentlemen of the town who are devotees of the ancient game of pool and billiards, and well it should La Rowe's Billiard and Pool Palace. be, for the place is admirably fitted up with five Gantor pool and three billiard tables of the finest make that money and brains combined could construct. The establishment is brilliantly illuminated with incondescent lights, draped with heavy lace curtains, and in fact everything to make it comfortable and home like. Mr. La Rowe is a native of Alexandria, Virginia. After receiving a good common school education he launched out into the world and has since made his way with credit and honor. Prior to coming to Charlottesville Mr. La Rowe conducted pool and billiard rooms, bowling alleys and cigar stand at Lexington, Virginia, with marked success, and these he still operates. Mr. La Rowe is also an excellent musician, and in this line too he has given instruction. He is a gentleman who has made a host of friends and his success in business is well deserved. C. L. Carver. A pleasant drive in our beautiful country is one of the most pleasant diversions possible, and a stable that can be depended on to furnish us fine animals and vehicles is "Payne's Livery," of which Mr. C. L. Carver is proprietor. This stable is located at 625 West Main Street, and has been established for many years, though Mr. Carver has only had charge of it a few months. From a commodious and sanitary standpoint it has few peers and no superiors. The structure is a three story brick, with a floor space of 24,000 feet. The concern does a livery and boarding business and enjoys a large trade in both. The first floor is devoted exclusively to the boarding of horses, each one being kept in a box stall, and the appearance of the horses is the best evidence of the care and feed they receive. The second floor is utilized for the livery horses and as a repository for rigs. There are thirty-two horses in the livery department, ranging from a trustable animal, that a child could drive, to the spirited stepper that a renowned whip would handle with pleasure. The third floor is used for the storage of feed and also for vehicles. In the rig line Mr. Carver has all descriptions, opened and Carver's Elegant Livery Stables. closed. He makes a specialty of student and commercial trade and his hacks are sent to all depots on order. Mr. Carver employs a corps of expert hostlers, thus insuring the best care of horses.

In 1884 at the age of eight years he came to Charlottesville where he received his education in the public schools, after serving his apprenticeship, was for four years inspector for the Albemarle Telephone Company. Mr. Bryant, July 4th, 1901, became the general superintendent of the Culpeper Telephone Company. He began there with an order for one telephone, but the business increased at such a rate under his able management that when he left it eighteen months later the exchange had 237 telephones with orders on the books for ten more. It should also be added that it was Mr. Bryant who hung all the combination gas and electric fixtures on the new Government Building, which was one of the largest contracts ever accomplished in this section. Mr. Bryant is a prominent member of the First Baptist Church, and all in all is one of our best and most highly respected citizens F. H. Wiseman.

Of the business men in our city who have been here for many years, none enjoys the confidence of his fellow citizens more, or stands higher in their esteem than Mr. E. J. Ward, proprietor of a large grocery and feed and sale stable at 600 and 602 East Market street. The store is quite commodious and the stock comprises all that is the best in staple and fancy groeries, fruits, produce and game in season. "Quick sales and small profits" is Mr. Ward's motto. Outside of the grocery business Mr. Ward is largely interested in horses, and in this line he is one of the leaders of the State. His stable is next door to the grocery, A Busy Day at Ward's Sales Stable. and is a two story brick structure containing some 4000 square feet of floor space, with stalls for thirty-five horses. The sanitary arrangements are excellent, the water and troughs being outside of the stable thus insuring it perfectly free from dampness. A general boarding and sale business is transacted, and a splendid trade in both branches is done. Only the best feeds are used and the glossy and fine appearance of the horses are the best evidences of the good care and treatment they receive. At these stables may be seen "Virginia Chief", (a picture of whom appears on another page) a splendid blue ribbon stallion, the property of Mr. W. M. Wilmer of Plain Dealing, and President Roosevelt's favorite horse while here. This great horse is the sire of several of Mr. Ward's horses that are to be seen at his stables. Mr. Ward is a splendid horseman and driver and is the winner of many first prizes. He is a gentleman of fine appearance and a native of Albemarle county. He has lived in Charlottesville for thirty years and is an all-right fellow. Monticello Wine Co. This Company was organized and chartered in 1873 by pioneers in grape culture in Albemarle County, Virginia. Encountering the predjudices which prevail against native wines it met with little encouragement for the first few years. The Company struggled on, having the great advantages of perfect grapes, proper cellar facilities and experienced foreign wine makers, in an honest effort to make a full-blooded, honest grape-juice wine, with no admixtures or deleterious compounds, and has gradually worked its way up to a recognition of its true merit. In 1878, at the request of the United States Agricultural Department, this company sent, under the charge of that Department, twelve bottles of their four kinds of red wine for the International Exposition at Paris, France. Other sections of the United States were represented there by pyramids of artistically exhibited wines, yet the final result was that seven medals were awarded to the still wines of the United States; of these the Monticello was the only one awarded a silver medal, the others being bronze, not one of which was obtained by California. Not to mention numerous awards by State and local fairs successively given this company in open competition, it was in 1884-85, at the New Orleans International Exhibition, with three cases sent at a venture, awarded two first-class medals, and again in 1889 obtained a silver medal and diploma at the Exposition Universelle at Paris, in competition with the wines of the world, by the judgment of those best qualified to decide the true merit of wines; also at the World's Columbian Exhibition at Chicago, 1893, this company Capt. Adolph Russow. was awarded two first-class medals for the superiority and excellency of their wines. Capt. Adolph Russow has had charge of the business since 1873, and is its general manager and superintendent He is peculiarly fitted for the position, and has the entire confidence of wine connoisseurs. Their white wines are Delaware, Dry Catawba, and Virginia Hock, a blend of Elvira, Etta and Riesling grapes fermented together. The red wines are Norton's Virginia and Cynthiana, of Burgundy character, Ives' Seedling, a ruby colored Claret, Extra Claret, of superior character, and Virginia Claret, a sound, plain table wine, Port, Sherry and Pure Grape Brandy. The demand for the goods is so great that no drummers are sent out, and it is found difficult to supply the demand. Bunch's Royal Cafe. Of the wine and liquor emporiums of Charlottesville the one conducted by H. D. &amp; A. Bunch at 421 East Main street comes very near being the undisputed leader, for the "boys" of Charlottesville know a good thing when they see and taste it. Here a square deal is guaranteed every customer. There are no "dull days" at Bunch's for there is always "something doing" every minute. The goods handled here are of the very best quality and anything foreign or domestic in the refreshment line can be obtained at short order.

Plymouth Gin, Booth &amp; Co. London Tom Gin, Monticello Wines, etc., also the finest brands of beers, such as Budweiser, Pabst, Schlitz Portner's Hof Brau, etc. Professors Bunch has the reputation of being good fellows and princes of the blood royal. The enterprise was established in 1885, by the late L. W. Bunch (father of the present proprietors) who conducted the business until his demise in 1897, when his son took charge. The Bunch boys have always endeavored to keep a highly respectable place. In a recent interview with our correspondent he said: "By the payment of nine hundred dollars and the compliance with the laws of the United States, the State of Virginia and the City of Charlottesville, we are permitted to retail intoxicating liquors at my place of business. To the wife who has a drunkard for a husband, or a friend who is unfortunately dissipated, I say, emphatically, give us notice in person of such case or cases in which you are interested, and all such shall be excluded from drinking at my bar. Let mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers do likewise and their requests shall be granted, we pay a heavy tax for the privilege of selling liquor, but want it distinctly understood that we have no desire to sell to drunkards, minors or to the poor and destitute, we much prefer that they save their money and put it where it will do the most good to their families. There are men of honor and men of money who can afford it, and it is with these that we desire to trade. We want to say to those who wish to trade with us, and can afford it, come and you will be treated in a courteous and gentlemanly manner and furnished with the best and purest of liquors." It will be seen from the foregoing that Mr. Bunch is a very intelligent gentleman and one who is endeavoring to do the right thing. Call and see him, he will be glad to make your acquaintance, if you have the price. William Garth. The subject of this sketch was born in Albemarle County 43 years ago, and it is safe to say that in his generation no man has brought better renown to his home. He stands today as the premier horseman of America, and his entries are so far in the lead in winnings that he is undoubtedly in a class by himself. Thirty-five times at Bennings and Pimlico has he taken first money, and thirty-five times has he secured places, a record that has never been equalled in the same length of time. He is justly proud of this achievement, and our people are proud as well. At Bennings the name of Garth as trainer was enough to always send the betting price down, for the book-makers knew that his horses were always run to win, and his rare ability in her possession nearly always placed them in the front. Virginia trained horses were the most popular of the Bennings meet this year, and day after day witnessed an enthusiastic tribute to Mr. Garth. His favorite horse, Pater, after winning five times, was sold for about $5,000, and is now one of the most famous horses in America. Paeon, also won five times, Bobbie Kean, four; Orphan Lad, three; Lady Vera, two; Hyperion, two; his other winners being T. S. Martin, Judge White, Kassil, Merrie Lassie, Savigny Kivlington, Follow On, Dunseverick, Gravella, and several others, making 35 winners, while other horses 35 times came inside the money.

His dam has produced eight stake winners. Mr. Garth is the owner of a fine home and splendid farm of 600 acres of the best land in Virginia, about 4 1-2 miles from Charlottesville, and it is here that all his training is done. His stable will house 45 horses, and is equipped with every modern convenience. Each horse lives in a comfortable box stall, while the sanitary arrangements are perfect. Water is furnished from a large reservoir, and is of superior quality as well as being a protection from fire. The training track is one-half mile in length, and is always kept in splendid condition. A large corps of riders and assistants is employed, each being an expert in his line, and each giving his work conscientious care. All is done under direct supervision of Mr. Garth, which guarantees faithful work and the best possible results. In addition to his ability as a horseman, Mr. Garth was formerly a star football player at the University of Virginia, and is recognized as one of the greatest athletes of our country. His great strength has aided him to a large extent in the arduous work of his profession. He is still a young man, and his enthusiasm and pride in his work, coupled with untiring effort and scrupulous honesty, will undoubtedly bring even greater results in the future. He is largely interested in agricultural and other pursuits, and is a liberal and progressive citizen. J. J. Thomas. There is no more efficient official in Albemarle County than Mr. J. J. Thomas the county jailer. He has led a clean and honorable career and has fulfilled most satisfactory the duties devolving upon him in the position he holds. Mr. Thomas was appointed to his present office in November, 1904, and succeeded J. P. Martin. During the time that he has had charge here everything has been conducted in a way that goes to show that he is a man of good executive ability and that he is the right man in the right place. Mr. Thomas was born in Nelson County in 1845. In the fall of 1866 he moved to Albemarle County, and took up farming and to this vocation he has devoted his life ever since. He is the owner of a fine large farm near Free Union, and has been very successful as an agriculturist. In October 1862 when the great Civil War between the States was raging furiously and with the greatest vehemence young Thomas enlisted under Capt.

Mr. Thomas is a public spirited and progressive citizen who is ever ready and willing to lend a helping hand to any cause that is for the welfare of old Charlottesville. James D. Via. Mr. James D.

There is something about a tailor made suit that gives a man a distinguished appearance that cannot be brought into effect by the ready to wear garments, and Charlottesville men are fortunate in having in their midst tailors who are adepts in the art of draping the human form. Among them one of the best known is E. F. Markwood, whose place of business is located at 211 West Main Street.

It was he who half a century back, long before the Civil War had disturbed the peace and tranquility of the nation, had suggested and conceived a gas plant for Charlottesville, then just blossoming into a prosperous village and struggling for a name among the towns of the South. Mr. Williams was called here from Philadelphia to found the plant, and this he did with great credit. During the Civil War he served as a soldier of the Confederacy in Co. "A," 19th Virginia Regiment. Even then it was often necessary for Charlottesville to call him home in order that the gas plant might continue in proper running order. Ever since the organization of the fire department Mr. Williams has been its Chief, and was one of the founders in 1886. Mr. Williams is a Mason and Elk and member of other fraternal organizations. C. D. Galligan. Hardly anything is desired by people of wealth and tasteful ideas more than antique furniture, and in every section of the country dealers are kept busy supplying the wants of their patrons and repairing old antiques which had been relegated to the garret as useless until the craze for it swept over the country. Of the dealers in the antique line here, by far the most prominent is Mr. C. D. Galligan, who is beyond question the best posted man in this line in the South. He has been engaged in it for many years, and can duplicate almost any of the most famous pieces.

Beautiful Estate of Murray Boocock. Among the distinguished citizens of Albemarle County, none stand higher for personal integrity than Mr. Murray Boocock, whose beautiful home "Castalia" is known throughout the Old Dominion. Mr. Boocock who is a native of New York purchased the farm a few years ago and immediately set out to bring it up to its present state of high cultivation, and this he has succeeded admirably in doing. Mr. Boocock is a gentleman of indefatigable energy, sound common sense, untiring progressiveness and confidence in the resources of Virginia. He has made himself very popular with the people of this section. Fortune has smiled upon him but it has not spoiled the man. His career has been honorable, square and true, and he is imbued with the determination to succeed and knows no such word as fail. At his magnificent home he dispenses a delightful hospitality. Like every man Mr. Boocock has his hobby, and that hobby is pure blooded stock. He maintains one of the best and most noted stock farms in America. His animals are his pride, and his stock is the finest that experience and money can secure. He has done more perhaps than any man in the State to improve the breed of cattle and is always ready to give the benefit of his experience to any one interested in the great work. Not long after taking up his residence here Mr. Boocock's attention was called to the degenerated and "scrubby" condition of the beef cattle of the South, and he began to study the question of the different beef breeds with a view of trying to bring about some improvement in this condition of affairs, After careful research he came to the decision that the Herefords were best suited to his purpose, and recognizing that the best blood was the surest method of attaining the standard of beef cattle desired, he attended the famous "Sunny Slope" sale of Herefords at Emporia, Kansas, March 2d, 1898, where he purchased Imp. Salisbury, at the highest price ever paid for a bull at public auction. He then collected a herd of females, every one of which is sired by or traces directly to the most famous sires of present and former days. The Breeders Gazette in reference to the above says "the remarkable Hereford sire, Imp. Salisbury, 76059, (19083) is now demonstrating the fact that his purchase as a prepotent sire of great breed character was based on sound judgment. The fine lot of calves sired by Salisbury from the best cows at Sunny Slope, before he went to head the herd at Castalia, the Hereford breeding farm of Murray Boocock, near Keswick, Virginia, are a wonderfully even lot, and all show great development. Their broad backs, well sprung ribs, deep twist, good quarters, fine bone, rich coats and neat heads, all prove the best of ancestry, and the Salisbury calves at Castalia are giving the same promises of great future usefulness. Mr. Boocock established his herd from some of the finest in America, and his constant efforts for good stock in general and the Herefords in particular, have been rewarded by hundreds of inquiries from Virginia and the Eastern and Southern States, and sales into a number of States already. The more good stock of any breed sold, the better for all breeds and all breeders. Some of the cows in the Castalia herd are: Shadeland Amber, 63457, by Earl of Shadeland 22d; Shadeland Lorna, 63549, by Shadeland 22d, Judy, 55711, by Peerless Wilton, and out of a Sir Richard 2d cow; Rosa 6th, 61,000, by Wild Tom, and Bess 2d, 72646, by Cherry Lad, by Cherry Boy." Mr. Boocock is also the owner of Lars, Jr., a model animal, showing "Quality" as his prominent feature from head to tail. From birth the bull had a most docile disposition, matured early and has always been a good feeder. His sire is Lars 50734. Second Prize Yearling bull at World's Fair, First and Champion Prize-Winner as a two, three and four-year-old at all the principal fairs; also headed by the herd winning Grand Sweepstakes at the great Live Stock Show of America at Madison Square Garden, New York City, in 1896. The dam of Lars, Jr., is Judy 55711 (one of the breeding cows in the Castalia herd, and is a regular breeder and excellent milker), by Peerless Wilton 12774, a sire of as many prize-winners as any Hereford bull living, and the dam of Judy is Jessie 3d 10908, by Sir Richard 2nd 970a, the celebrated sire of prizewinners, and especially of good breeding cows. Thus Lars, Jr., may rightfully be expected to be a sire of good animals. This herd has been very successful in the show-ring and has captured many prizes over competing herds. At the Southern Interstate Exposition at Atlanta, Ga., where seventeen head of show cattle were taken from this herd, seventeen prizes were awarded them. The stock at the Castalia Farm is as fine as mortal man has ever seen and blue ribbons are the commonest kind of things there. Mr. Boocock is President of the Virginia Hereford Breeders Association, Vice-President of the Keswick Hunt Club, and takes an active interest in the hunting and social events of the charming Keswick neighborhood, besides being an enthusiastic worker for good roads. He is a country gentleman of the best American type. The present road situation demands instant relief. Mr. Murray Boocock published a letter, dated January 25, suggesting a county organization with a view of ultimately securing State aid, the only practical method of road building, and is advocated by the United States Office of Road Inquiry. Our roads are the worst in the land, so for heaven's sake let us get to work and do something in this direction. J. M. Fray &amp; Co.—Advance Mills.

The stock is most complete and contains a full line of staple and fancy groceries, meats, shoes, notions, glassware, dry goods, grain, mill feed, etc. The store presents a most inviting appearance being kept in the cleanest manner possible. A feature which Mr. Harlan has introduced are the "silent salesmen" showcases, the most expensive manufactured and rarely found in stores outside of the largest cities. The stock is displayed in a tempting manner and adds greatly to the general beauty of the place. Mr. Harlan was born in Albemarle County, near Scottsville and was educated in this section. After finishing his studies he entered the mercantile line as a clerk and by close application to business soon won promotion. Four years ago he opened a business of his own at the present site. He made it a point to purchase only the best goods and through his low prices and his fair dealings with patrons soon built up a splendid business until today no man in the commercial walks of life is more highly esteemed by his fellow citizens. Mr. Harlan is well known fraternally being a member of the Junior Order of American Mechanics, Odd Fellows and its higher branch, the Encampment. J. C. Matthews. The health of a community depends largely upon the bread distributed by its bakers, and one of our prominent leaders in this line is Mr. J. C. Matthews, whose store is located at 313 and 315 East Main street. Only the purest flour and other ingredients are used in the makeup of his goods thus insuring them to be perfectly pure. The store is a large one while the baking department is located in the rear of the main building and is fitted with all the most modern machinery and paraphernalia necessary to the work at hand. Several hands are employed and the sanitary conditions are as perfect as it is possible to get them. In addition to bread all classes of high grade pastries are made and their excellence is too well known to need retelling. Aside from his baking department Mr. Matthews conducts one of the largest ice cream manufactories in the city and his output in this branch bears the reputation of being the finest in the city. He also carries a large supply of toys, cakes, fancy ices, nuts and candies and makes a specialty of Appollo and Lowney's high grade candies. Several wagons are utilized in delivering goods and the trade is extending rapidly. Mr. Matthews was born in Hanover County, and came here in 1876 and entered the grocery business. He remained in that until 1882 when he opened the establishment he now conducts under the firm name of Thomas and Matthews. In 1886 Mr. Matthews purchased the Thomas interests and has since conducted the business himself. "Black Cat" Billard Parlors. In the old post-office building corner of Main and Second streets, right in the very heart of the city, has just been opened one of the largest and finest pool and billiard rooms in Central Virginia. Its progressive proprietor is Mr. B. B. Butt, Jr., a gentleman who is recognized as one of Charlottesville's go-ahead young men, and his personal popularity is attested by the large and influential business his establishment receives. Only high class, respectable patrons are catered to, and no boisterous or ungentlemanly conduct is tolerated. The parlors are fitted up in the most approved and luxurious manner. The four pool and one billiard tables are of the very latest improved Brunswick-Balke make, with return gutter pockets, while all the wood work is of carved quarter oak. The cues are of all the regulation weights and are ivory tipped. The balls are made from the very best African tusk ivory that money can buy. The establishment is highly illuminated by scores of Edison incandescent lights and gas and the walls are covered with rich crimson Scotch burlap, which gives the place a tone of magnificence and grandeur as seldom seen outside of the great Metropolitan cities. The Black Cat Pool Room is heated by steam and comfortable easy chairs are tastefully arranged about the resort. In connection with this is the cigar and tobacco stand where lovers of the seductive weed may purchase the most delightful and fragrant Havana cigar ever smoked by mortal man. This is undoubtedly the best and most wholesome resort of its kind in Charlottesville for gentlemen to spend a social hour in innocent amusement. Mr. Butt is a popular and prominent member of Royal Arcanum and the Junior Order American Mechanics. D. L. Mauch. A splendid new business enterprise has been added to commercial Charlottesville, and it is one, from all present indications that is bound to prove a most successful venture. The concern to which we have reference is that conducted by Mr. D. L. Mauch at No. 407 East Market street. Mr. Mauch is a wholesale dealer in poultry and eggs and his trade is increasing at such a rate that he finds it difficult to keep up with the demands; the business having far surpassed his most sanguine expectations. Mr. Mauch pays the highest market prices and has already contracted with some of the largest poultry raisers in this section and is rapidly extending his buying province, though confining himself to this section and expects to continue to do so as long as he can procure the grade and quantity he requires. Each week Mr. Mauch ships to Philadelphia a car load of eggs and soon expects to double this quantity. Mr. Mauch is well and favorably known throughout the county as a buyer, seller and shipper of apples, a line of business which he has been engaged in all his life. He is one of the most prominent men in this line, all his apples are shipped to Pittsburg. He is a public spirited and progressive citizen who is ever ready and willing to lend a helping hand to any cause that is for the welfare of old Charlottesville, his home and the little city Establishment of D. L. Mauch. in which he has cast his fortunes. Mr. Mauch was born near Luray, Page County. In Masonic circles he is both popular and prominent. H. M. Gleason. A grocer in this city who makes a specialty of handling only the purest stock and who has a wide reputation as a purveyor of the best quality of goods is Mr. H. M. Gleason of 401 East Main Street. While Mr. Gleason's stock is a varied one comprising staple and fancy groceries, hay, mill feed, seeds, domestic dry goods, notions, boots, shoes, etc., he makes a specialty of the groceries and his trade in that branch One Floor of the Gilmore Furniture Co.'s Store. cannot be excelled. In the flour line he handles the very best patents making a leader of the White Star Mills, Brown Milling Company and J. E. M. The store is, in addition to being one of the largest in the city, nicely fitted and the stock is arranged in a most tempting and inviting manner. Mr. Gleason, the proprietor is one of the most popular and best known men in the city, having lived here all his life. He was born in Rockbridge county and came here with his parents when very young. The present business was founded by his father and in 1873, Mr. Gleason entered his employ in the capacity of a clerk. In 1875 the father disposed of his interests to the present owner and a Mr. Bailey and the firm was organized under the style of Gleason &amp; Bailey. This continued until May, 1903, when the partnership was dissolved and the enterprise has since been conducted by Mr. Gleason. As a man of upright and straightforward business principles Mr. Gleason has no superior. He gives good weight, and sells at prices as low as are consistent with the quality of the goods carried. Wingfield &amp; North. Standing out prominently in the front rank among the leading establishments in their line in Charlottesville is the progressive firm of Wingfield &amp; North of 916 West Main street. They are expert painters and paper hangers and do an extensive business throughout the city and vicinity. They are well and favorably known as strictly honest and proficient workmen and they have contracted for work with many of the leading families of Charlottesville. All of whom thoroughly rely upon their integrity, as well they should, for it becomes a matter of the most vital importance to patronize an honest concern whose reputation and standing are a perfect guarantee of reliability. Wingfield &amp; North keep on hand sample shades, designs and qualities of both foreign and domestic wall papers, all of which are of the very latest manufacture and are sold by the leading houses of Washington, Baltimore and New York.

Three miles from Charlottesville, near Rio, on an eminence that rivals even the magnificent view from "Monticello," is located "Hilltop," the home of Mr. Barnes Compton, who came to Albemarle last September. The house, surrounded as it is by beautiful grounds, and having been fitted with every modern convenience, is considered one of the handsomest places in our county, and the picture accompanying this article shows the dense and cooling foliage that surrounds the home. Mr. Compton is making a specialty in the stock line of Yorkshire hogs, of imported breed, He also has a large orchard of the celebrated Wine Saps, and intends going into fruit raising on a large scale. "Hilltop"—Home of Mr. Barnes Compton. He who knows most, grieves most for wasted time.—Dante. "ELLERSLIE STOCK FARM" R. J. Hancock &amp; Son. The now senior member of the firm of R. J. Hancock &amp; Son commenced the breeding of thoroughbred stock at Ellerslie about forty years ago. Since that time many of the best race horses of modern times have been bred there. This was the home of the celebrated Eolus, whose descendants have won more than one million dollars in stakes and purses. He was the sire of Eole, St. Saviour, Eon, Morello, Diablo, Russell, Knight of Ellerslie, Henry of Navarre's sire, Eurus, Elkwood, Eolian and many other good race horses. The home of imported Charaxus, sire of Charade, Charentus, Ethics, Hammie, Don Quixote, Rosinante, Col. Padden, Ma Belle, Charina, Keator. &amp;c.; of Eon sire of Eonic, Minotaur, Charley Moore, and the dams of Harangue, Pater and Workman. The stallion in service now is Imported Fatherless, sire of Workman, Mistiss and ten two year old winners in 1905 of 33 races. These included the stake winners Pater and T. S. Martin besides The Clown and other good ones. This season he has sired the two year old winners Orphan Lad, winner of four races, including the Jesse Brown Cup, and Sanscrit. The sons and daughters of Eolus, Imported Charaxus, Eon and Imported Fatherless have won nearly every important event in the United States and many of them twice: viz. The Futurity Stakes, The Suburben (twice), The Brooklyn, The Brighton, Metropolitan, The Carter, The Nottingham (in England), The Burns, The Bennings (twice) and The Twin City Handicaps, The Tidal, Galliard, Brooklyn Derby, Carleton (twice), Double Event, Jesse Brown Cup (twice), Chicago Derby, Sea and Sound, &amp;c., being a few of the many events secured by them. Hardly a day passes that one of their descendants does not win in the United States, and as many as half the races on the card sometimes have gone to them. The herd of Short Horns at Ellerslie was founded about the same time, with descendants of the imported cows Young Phyllis, Elizabeth, Mary Ann, Victoria, Zelia and Fashion. Since that time bulls of the Abe Renick strain of Rose of Sharons, the Princess blood, through imported Lady Sale 2nd., and descendants of imported Mina's Princess are a few of the strains used. The families for the most part are of the Bates and Booth strains of short horns, and have been topped with excellent Scotch blood. The milking qualities of this herd have been kept up, and they are a fine type of beef cattle. The bull now in use is Royal Lad, son of Frantic Lad, second in class of 38 at Chicago International. Frantic Lad is by The-Lad-For-Me, one of the most celebrated show bulls and sires in America. Royal Lad was advertised by his breeders as the best calf ever bred in their famous Beechwood herd. The Southdowns at Ellerslie are descended from ewes from Druid Hill Park flock, Baltimore. The Park commission originally bought from Governor Oden Bowie, of Maryland thirty (30) ewes for $1,000. They used with these ewes the best imported rams that money could buy, and the sons of these rams, avoiding too close inbreeding all the time. Some years ago Ellerslie secured twenty ewes from Druid Hill flock, and has used Warwick, imported from the King's place, Sandringham Park, England; Drummond 329, by Jubilee, imported from Duke of Richmond's flock; Drummond 461, by Sandringham, imported from The King's flock, and Senator, a prize winner as a lamb and a yearling in Canada and a son of Union Jack, imported from Mr. C. W. Adeane's flock in England. Drummond 329, Drummond 461 and Senator were all bred by Hon. George Drummond, Canada, the most celebrated American breeder of Southdowns. The King's, Duke of Richmond's and Mr. Adeane's flocks stand at the top of all English flocks. In the Berkshire herd Ellerslie is using a grandson of the great boar imported Lustre's Bachelor, and the Residence of Mrs. Mary C. Gooch. sows are of pure Biltmore blood. Thoroughbred horses, Short Horn cattle, Southdown sheep and Berkshire hogs are at Ellerslie for sale and prices can be had by applying to R. J. Hancock &amp; Son, Charlottesville, Virginia. Immigration South. At a recent meeting of the Southern Immigration Commission which met in New York City June 5, to discuss methods for the securing of desirable immigrants for the South a letter was read from Theodore Marbury, of Baltimore who is a member of the immigration, committee of the civic federaation in which Mr. Marbury wrote that only 4 1-2 per cent of the immigrants coming to this country last year went to Southern States, and that there was urgent need in the South of an immigration of a new race which can be counted to make its contributions to progress. Immigration Commissioner Watchorn, said: "Immigrants who arrive here are for Northern points and if you were to try and steer them from their several points they would think you were bunco men. Unless the wages of the South are brought up to the standard of those of the North you cannot expect immigrants to go South and if you did get them to go they would not stay because they would probably hear from their relatives in the North who were making more money." This statement caused surprise among members of the Commission who seemed to be under the impression that immigrants have no special destination and would gladly accept any proposition which was made them. In order that the Commission might be convinced Commissioner Watchorn allowed Chairman J. L. Graybill to question several of the immigrants. Of the half dozen or more questioned not one would consent to abandon the place he was bound for and go South. J. L. Duffill. Well known and very highly respected in the business world of Charlottesville is Mr. J. L. Duffill, the city huckster, whose residence and offices are at No. 25, 10th Street. Mr. Duffill has been engaged in this capacity for a number of years and supplies this city and suburban residents with all kinds of the best fresh fruits, poultry, vegetables, meats, groceries, etc., which are brought to the door every morning or as may be desired. He is the only huckster in the city, and we could not very well get along without him. He is a strictly honest, absolutely reliable man, and all foods supplied by him may be relied upon to be pure and of finest quality in every respect. All orders sent to him at No. 125 Tenth street are promptly attended to. He is a prominent member of the Methodist Church and the Junior Order American Mechanics. Anderson Bros. Anderson Bros., publishers, booksellers and stationers, are the leaders in their line at the University. The business was established in 1881, under the able management of Messrs. Richard D. and John R. Anderson, two up-to-date business men, possessing exceptional social qualities. Their business increased so rapidly that in 1889 they erected their own building. In June, '99, death took away Richard D., the junior member of the firm. The firm are publishers of Minor's Institutes, and other works by University professors. The stock of books, Anderson Bros., "University Book Store." stationery, etc., is most complete.

As a medicinal whiskey cannot be excelled, and in hundreds of cases its use is advocated by the most eminent physicians, while nothing makes a dinner more palatable than wines and brandy. A recognized leader in the liquor line in this city is the enterprising firm of S. Aronhime &amp; Son, of 601 West Main street. It is a most spacious structure having over 3750 square feet of floor space utilized for the accommodation of the large stock carried. The front portion of the store is devoted to a jug and bottle trade of which the company makes a specialty, while in the rear is a large and handsome bar where wines, liquors, beers, both draft and bottled, and choice cigars are dispensed. The firm is composed of S. Aronhime and his son G. L. Aronhime, though the former has now retired and makes his home in Richmond, leaving the enterprise in charge of the son. The business was establishtd in 1874 by the elder Aronhime and he soon enjoyed a large patronage. In 1898 Mr. G. L. Aronhime entered the employ of his father as a clerk and continued in that capacity until he became of age when he was taken into partnership. In May of 1894 Mr. Aronhime senior, retired from active participation in the management and the son has since conducted it. The concern is widely known and does one of the largest mail order businesses in the State, the shipments being made immediately upon receipt of the order. They have an exceptionally large call for their special brands, "Aronhime's Best," Old Charter and the Three Dollar Special, though their other brands are ready sellers and have a wide reputation. Both Mr. Aronhime and his son are prominent in lodge circles being a member of the Masons and Elks. Mr. G. L. Aronhime was born in this city and has lived here all his life. He is well known in business and social circles and stands high in the community for honesty and square dealing with his fellow men. C. G. Page. A resort where one can get a drink, a good cigar and enjoy a chat with men of intelligence is the Imperial Cafe at 619 West Main street, conducted by Mr. C. G. Page, one of the most highly esteemed men of our city. The Cafe is one of the most finely fitted and commodious in the State having a floor space of 3750 square feet. The bar is of quartered oak trimmed in brass and the finest parian marble. The sideboard is of the same material and a large mirror surmounts it. While myriads of electic lights cast their rays upon the immaculate glassware making a scintillating picture of great magnificence. Mr. Page has a full line of the finest wines, liquors, whiskies, draft and bottled beers carried in this section and a choice line of cigars, cigarets and tobacco. He also has a fine assortment of jug and bottled goods of which he makes a specialty and a complete lot of soft drinks. One of the most expert drink mixers and servers in the city. Mr. L. C. Taylor, attends to the wants of the patrons and has aided materially in building up the large trade the concern enjoys. Mr. Page, proprietor of the place was born in Nelson County, Virginia and moved here in 1886. For many years he was employed on the Southern Railroad but in February of 1899 he resigned his position and in July of that year, was appointed a member of the local police force. He served with honor and distinction in this capacity until August 1902, when he resigned and returned to his railroad position remaining there until November of that year when he was again appointed to the police force, where he remained until September 1904. In November of that year he opened his saloon and has built up a business that is unexcelled by his fair and honest business methods. Mr. Page also owns a large farm in the county and during his leisure moments devotes his time to agricultural pursuits. We emphatically deny the oft repeated allegation that "Virginians are a close corporation and one great mutual admiration society." W. SAM BURNLEY, Attorney at Law. 219 Court Street, Charlottesville, Va. Sketch of my life and pedigree furnished on application. The heights by great men reached and kept Were not attained by sudden flight, But they while their companions slept Were toiling upward in the night. Longfellow. C. N. Bolser. The old stand formerly conducted by Mr. F. G. Hicks at the corner of Main and Fifth streets has just been purchased by Mr. C. N. Bolser who is well known to most of our people having been in business here for several years. Under Mr. Bolser's management the establishment is promised a most successful career and there is no reason why it should not, for the proprietor is a man of sterling character and is fully possessed with plenty of pluck and energy qualifications that are so essential to the business man of the present day. The stock of choice foreign and domestic wines, liquors and cigars here cannot be duplicated by any saloon in this section of Virginia. Mr. Bolser was born near Staunton, in the Valley of Virginia and was formerly connected with the C. &amp; O. Railroad. By perseverence he gradually worked his way from an ordinary track man to a responsible position in the Paymasters department. After leaving the railway service he established himself in the grocery and meat business. Mr. Bolser intends making many improvements and it will not be long before his place will be one of the most comfortable refreshment resorts to be found in the State.

Another splendid Albemarle County enterprise is the Earlysville Supply Company, located at the place of that name. A general country store business is transacted and everything in the way of first class merchandise can be found at the progressive establishment. Full lines of dry goods, notions, General Store of the Earlysville Supply Co. clothing, boots, shoes, hats, caps and staple and fancy grocers are to be found here, all of which are sold at honest rock bottom prices. The general manager is Mr. W. B. Marshall, a gentleman of fine business qualifications, who purchased the enterprise from James A. Fensley about two years ago. The business is now one of the most prosperous in the county, and is valued at about $6,000. It is located about twelve miles from Charlottesville and six from the Southern Railway on one of the best drive-ways in the State. Mr. Marshall was for a number of years a member of the firm "Ednam," Home of E. O. Meyer, Esq. of Marshall Bros., well known throughout the State as artistic painters of fine country homes. Mr. Marshall is also the proprietor of a splendid sassafras oil mill, which is located near his store. This mill is of vast benefit to the surrounding country as thousands of roots are purchased each year for the manufacture of the oil. The product is large, and the demand for it is constantly increasing. Mr. Marshall is the owner of a handsome home such as befits a man of his business standing. It is most conveniently arranged, and is perhaps the most modern in its furnishings for miles around. Everything about the place indicates activity and prosperity, and the genial proprietor can be found at all times ready for business on straight business lines. E. O. Meyer, Esq. On the Ivy road, about three miles from Charlottesville, on what was formerly a part of the historic "Birdwood" Estate, perched like a baronial castle overlooking the majestic hills of Albemarle, stands Ednam Hall, the home of Mr. E. O. Meyer. As the knights of old constructed and developed the place of their abodes, so Mr. Meyer has cared for "Ednam," but Ednam is not a castle. It is more like the residence of an English country gentleman of today. It is an expression of the home life of Mr. Meyer, showing his love for nature, for hills, woods and flowers, for green fields and the pure free air of heaven. Ednam Manor is doubly interesting, because the place as it stands today is typical of both the past and the present regime. The surroundings are with things ancient, that always have a charm, with things modern, that are comforting to practical mankind. One appeals to the sentiment, the other to the side of human nature that loves luxury and ease. Leaving the history of "Birdwood" out, and taking up the modern side we find that Ednam is fully keeping apace with the world, for here are majestic dining halls, library, princely parlors, etc., all made possible by modern conveniences and appliances and the possession of the means with which to acquire them. Ednam was erected at great expense in 1901. Its gates open into a winding road which lead to the grand porch of the house. Upon entering the mansion a feature that profoundly impresses the visitor is the gorgeous reception hall, an apartment, by the way, that has but few equals in this country for magnificence. To descrite properly the furnishings we will not make the attempt, but will leave it to vivid imagination. The grounds of Ednam cover 160 broad acres, on which are many big trees planted years ago with the idea of producing an effective landscape. Evergreens, spruce and others of the cultivated class mingle with those of the forest variety. The lawns are leveled and kept in perfect trim. Such in brief is Ednam the worthy home of a worthy man, Mr. E. O. Meyer, our neighbor and fellow citizen. Central Coal Co. The largest and best equipped enterprise of its kind here is the Central Coal Company, owned by Messrs. Gardner and Mr. F. G. Brooks. The plant and works are located at Third street and the C. &amp; O. Railway. The concern handles coal, wood, lime, cement, patent plaster, and everything pertaining to their business. Their trade is rapidly outgrowing their present spacious quarters, although a year ago they purchased a large site on the opposite side of Third street. The Central Coal Company makes a specialty of Virginia Merrimac W. B. Gardner. Anthracite Coal for which they are sole agents in this vicinity. This coal has given the best of satisfaction for both heating and cooking, and it is absolutely free from slate and clinker. Any user of this product is referred to with confidence, and a trial is solicited with absolute faith in the result. Pennsylvania anthracite is also handled, as well as many other kinds, and Red Ash Run of the Mine, for steaming purposes, is another specialty in which they have a large trade. Sawed and split wood of any size can be procured at the lowest possible prices. The yards are equipped with every modern convenience, the railway having run a switch on a trestle over the coal bins in such a manner that one man can unload 50 tons of coal in 30 minutes, while the power for sawing wood and handling of other goods is furnished by two large electric dynamos, one of which is located at each end of the immense yards. Mr. W. B. Gardner, the manager and founder of the enterprise, is a native of Albemarle County, and came to Charlottesville about 16 years ago, when he accepted a position with the Charlottesville Hardware Co. After remaining in their employ for ten years, he resigned and purchased a fine farm and followed agricultural pursuits on account of poor health. Two years later with health restored he sold his country place and established his present enterprise. By strict integrity and unfaltering attention to the affairs of the plant he has won the confidence of our citizens and the large and rapidly increasing trade the firm enjoys is the result. So large indeed is the business that six delivery wagons are in constant service and it is frequently necessary to engage other wagons to help accommodate their customers. About one year ago Mr. F. G. Brook purchased one-half interest in the plant, and since that time the style of the firm has been the Central Coal Company. Mr. Brook is a native of Culpeper, and has for many years been a mail clerk on the Southern Railway. Main Building of Crozet Cooperage Co. R. E. Wayland. Albemarle County presents many examples of success achieved by energy and enterprise, a prominent example being represented in the career of Mr. R. E. Wayland of Crozet. When he first entered the commercial field it was on a modest scale compared with the present extensive proportions. The success of every business venture depends almost entirely upon its management. If energy and enterprise be at the helm, even though the capital be limited, the roughest storms of adversity are often weathered. One of the largest enterprises with which he is connected is the Crozet Cooperage Company in which concern Mr. Russell Bargamin of Richmond and Mr. H. B. Wayland of Covesville are his partners. This plant is one of the very best in the county and is thoroughly equipped with all the latest improved appliances. They are manufacturers of high grade apple and flour barrels and are ready to supply almost any quantity at a moment's notice. The shops are located on the C. &amp; O. Railway and goods can be shipped in short order. Nearly all the material used in the factory is bought in the immediate vicinity, and this added to the fact that a large force of workmen is constantly employed, to whom are paid good wages, makes the enterprise one of great benefit to the thriving little town in which it is located. Mr. R. E. Wayland is the general manager of the works. He is also the cashier of the new bank of Crozet and Secretary and Treasurer of the Crozet Cider Company a concern that is doing a very extensive business. These enterprises have served to spread abroad the fame of our county and in them we take commendable pride for they are forcible illustrations of what is being accomplished in this section of the Old Dominion by American skill and ingenuity.

      <field name="fulltext">Appendix page 3 Center — "THE HANDSOME NEW FEDERAL BUILDING." — Now home to the Central Library of the Jefferson Madison Regional Library, 201 E. Market St. was built as a Federal courthouse and post office. An addition was built on the east end of the building in 1936 and the front portico was shifted to center it on the new facade. Although the gate entrance at right is gone, the existing sidewalk with its checkerboard pattern still bears a trace of it. In the background of this photo is the steeple of the First Baptist Church (see page 11). page 4 Top left — "DR. WILSON C. N. RANDOLPH, GREAT GRANDSON OF THOMAS JEFFERSON, AND A RESIDENT OF CHARLOTTESVILLE." — (25 October 1834 - 26 April 1907). The son of Thomas Jefferson Randolph and Jane Nicholas, W. C. N. Randolph was born at "Edgehill." He was a leading physician in the community and rector of the University of Virginia for eight years. Center — "THOMAS JEFFERSON, THIRD PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES." — (13 April 1743 - 4 July 1826). Bottom center — " `MONTICELLO,' THE HOME OF THOMAS JEFFERSON." — Jefferson began building his mountaintop home in 1770 and continued working on it over the next forty years. It is located on Rt. 53 southeast of Charlottesville. Top right — "HON. JEFFERSON M[onroe]. LEVY." — Contrary to the article, Monticello did not come into Levy hands upon Thomas Jefferson's death. Commodore Uriah Levy was the second owner after Jefferson's heirs sold the estate, acquiring it in 1836. After the commodore's death, the house sat empty for nearly two decades wrapped in legal entanglements. Monticello was eventually bought by Jefferson Monroe Levy, the commodore's nephew. Although only a summer resident of Monticello, Mr. Levy lavished large amounts of money and affection on his estate, caring for the rundown house and building up the acreage. Because of the national reverence for Thomas Jefferson and consequently his house, Levy was continually forced to defy efforts to wrest Monticello from his private ownership. In 1923, compelled by financial reverses, he tearfully signed the estate over to the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, which now operates Monticello as a museum. page 5 Top left — "HOME OF MERIWETHER LEWIS AT IVY (OF LEWIS AND CLARK EXPEDITION)." — Meriwether Lewis was born on 18 August 1774 and died in Tennessee on 11 October 1809. The location of Lewis's birthplace as stated in the article is incorrect. The Magazine text states it was "where the home of Mrs. Farish now stands between here and the Woolen Mills." This describes "The Farm" of Nicholas Lewis on E. Jefferson St., not the house, "Locust Hill," in the photo. "Locust Hill" stands today on Rt. 678 near Ivy. The original cabin in which Lewis was born burned in the early 1800s and the present house was rebuilt shortly afterwards on the site. Top right — "SITE OF HOME OF WILLIAM CLARK (OF LEWIS AND CLARK EXPEDITION) NEAR CHARLOTTESVILLE. THE GENTLEMAN SEEN IS MR. E. A. PERRY." — This caption and the article on this page under "Louisiana Purchase" are in error, for William Clark (1 August 1770 - 1 September 1838) never lived in Albemarle County. His family, however, did live here for a time before his birth. William's older brother, George Rogers Clark, was born on property now on the estate "Buena Vista" on Rt. 20 North, off Rt. 250 East. George Rogers Clark (19 November 1752 - 13 February 1818) was famous for his conquest of the Northwest Territory in the American Revolution. William was born in Caroline County, where his parents moved when George Rogers was a young child. The George Rogers Clark Museum, a period recreation of Clark's birthplace, was established at the original site in the 1970s using the miller's house which had been moved there from a nearby mill. Only open to the public for a few years, the miller's house is visible in the field south of the main brick house at "Buena Vista." Center — "CHARLOTTESVILLE IN 1789. ORIGINAL DRAWING THE PROPERTY OF ST. ANTHONY'S HALL." — This caption misidentifies the date and scene. This is a view of "The Barracks," a temporary prisoner-of-war encampment established northwest of Charlottesville for German and British soldiers captured at the Battle of Saratoga during the American Revolution. They were brought to Albemarle County in 1779. This engraving appeared in Thomas Anburey's Travels Through the Interior Parts of America. Today's "Barracks Road" leads towards this site. Bottom center — "THE ANCIENT COURTHOUSE, ERECTED 1803." — Located at the corner of Jefferson and Park St., this photograph actually shows the portion built in 1859-60. The rear, or north wing, dates to 1803. The stucco facade with Gothic detailing seen in this photograph was removed and replaced with brick facing and classical detailing during a 1938 facelift. During the same building project, the County Clerk's office seen at left was torn down and rebuilt in the Colonial Revival style. The building on the right, also gone, was once part of a row of law offices. page 6 Top left — "JOHNNY YEARGAN, THE MISER, FROM THE ORIGINAL PAINTING BY THE CELEBRATED ARTIST, JOHN O'TOOLE." — This painting of the miser, being startled as he counts his money, is now owned by the Albemarle County Historical Society. This article is written by Charles C. Wertenbaker (see page 7). Center — "HOME OF JOHNNY YEARGAN, WHERE HE WAS FOUND DEAD, PRESUMABLY MURDERED. THE MEN IN THE PICTURE ARE A. E. WALKER AND F. T. RICHARDSON, REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PROGRESS." — James Alexander, in Recollections of Early Charlottesville, is somewhat more precise about Yeargan's demise: "He died suddenly. . .it is believed that in a fit of apoplexy he fell into the fireplace, where he was found dead with a slight bruise on his forehead." The brick building pictured here, 218-220 Court Square, was built in the 1850s on the site of Yeargan's frame house, to house law offices. The building was acquired in 1967 by its current owner, the Albemarle County Historical Society. A. E. Walker, pictured at left, compiled the original edition of this Daily Progress Historical and Industrial Magazine. Bottom — "THE OLD POST OFFICE, CORNER MAIN AND SECOND STREETS, EAST." — The National Bank of Charlottesville, 123 E. Main St., replaced this building in 1919. The bank has now been renamed Jefferson National Bank. The Old Post Office, also known as the Rosser Building, was built ca. 1895 by Thomas Lafayette Rosser. The building closely resembled the Leterman Building (see page 27) which still stands one block to the west. The Rosser building housed the Post Office until it was moved to its new quarters, the Federal Building (see page 3), in 1906. page 7 Top right — "COL. CHARLES C. WERTENBAKER." — Wertenbaker wrote several articles in this magazine under the name "Senex." A brief paragraph listing those articles appears below his photograph. Colonel Wertenbaker was a Civil War veteran, having served in the 19th Virginia Regiment. Center — "ARMORY OF THE MONTICELLO GUARD." — Built in 1891, the armory stood next to old City Hall near the corner of 5th and E. Market St. It later became the city's recreation center, after the Guard built another armory a block east on Market St. in 1937. Ironically, that building is also now a recreation center. The old Armory was torn down around 1970. The Parking Garage occupies the site of both the armory and old City Hall (see page 8). Lower left — "JOHN BROWN FROM PICTURE TAKEN AT HIS HOME IN TORRINGTON, CONN., 1857." — The Monticello Guard was present at his execution in 1859. Bottom center — "MONTICELLO GUARD, AID TO CIVIL AUTHORITY, RICHMOND STREET CAR STRIKE, JUNE-JULY, 1903." — On 17 June 1903 conductors and motormen employed by the Virginia Passenger and Power Company went on strike in a dispute over demanded wage increases. The company responded the next day by attempting to run its cars using strike-breakers. The action precipitated riots, and by 23 June the Governor was compelled to call in volunteer companies from around the Commonwealth, including the Monticello Guard, to assist police. After a month of rioting and disorder, troops were finally withdrawn on 23 July. page 8 Upper center — "MUNICIPAL BUILDING-POLICE HEADQUARTERS." — This building stood at the corner of 5th St., NE and E. Market St., where the city parking garage is now located. The retaining wall in the foreground and a tree were left standing when these buildings were torn down. Built in 1852 as the Farmer's Bank, it was later the home of the Thornley family before the town of Charlottesville purchased it in 1887 for use as its municipal headquarters. It was torn down shortly after the opening of the new City Hall in 1969. Center — "W. T. MARTIN, PRESIDENT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE." — (28 September 1856 - 26 August 1916). Mr. Martin founded Martin's Hardware, which occupied space where the Paramount Theatre stands in the 200 block of E. Main St. There was also an entrance at the rear on E. Market St. across from today's Jefferson-Madison Regional Library. The property was sold to make way for the Paramount Theatre in 1930-31, and the store moved to the corner of Water and 2nd St. SE. Although no longer in the Martin family, the hardware store is still in business under the same name, and is now located at 941 Preston Ave. near Preston Plaza shopping center. Bottom center — "THE MIDWAY SCHOOL BUILDING." — Built in 1893 as the graded school for Charlottesville's white students, this building was the first location of Charlottesville High School, later called Lane High School. It was replaced in 1940 by new Lane High School (now the Albemarle County Office Building) at the northwest corner of Preston Ave. and McIntire Road. Old Midway housed a number of city agencies, notably the Welfare and Health Departments, until 1966 and was also used for storage. It was torn down in 1973. Today, Midway Manor apartments at 100 Ridge St. occupies the site. page 9 Top left — "NEW HOME OF THE ELKS." — Completed in 1903, this building is still standing at 411 E. High St. and now houses the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court. A fire on March 30, 1960 resulted in the destruction of the portico, though the bases of its columns remain. Center — "NEW CHESAPEAKE AND OHIO RAILWAY STATION — LENGTH 500 FEET." — This building still stands at 600 E. Water St. at the eastern end of Water St. After being vacant for many years, it has been renovated into office and retail space and currently houses Davenport and Co. of Virginia. The Belmont Bridge seen at left in this photo was built in 1905 and was replaced by the current bridge in 1961. Lower right — "THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE THE DAILY PROGRESS." — This building still stands directly south of 211 5th St. NE (seen at extreme right). It does not appear to have a street number now, but in 1906 was 209 5th St. NE. The building was incorporated into the new building when the Daily Progress expanded onto E. Market St. in the 1950s. Its facade was removed and the door now sports an "Employee Entrance" sign. page 10 Top right — "EDWIN ANDERSON ALDERMAN, LL. D., FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE UNIVERSITY." — (15 May 1861 - 29 April 1931). In 1904, after eighty-five years of existence, the University of Virginia abandoned its antiquated administrative system, which vested responsibility for running the University in the Chairman of the Faculty. In its stead, an educator of outstanding ability was sought to fill the post of President of the University. Edwin Anderson Alderman, who had served briefly as President of the University of North Carolina and of Tulane University, was chosen to lead the University at this critical juncture in the school's history. He remained its President until his death in 1931. Center — "SOUTH FRONT OF THE ROTUNDA." — This view, seen from the Lawn, shows the Rotunda as rebuilt by architect Stanford White after the disastrous fire of 1895. The University library was housed here. Pavilion I is seen at left. Bottom left — "EAST LAWN." — Pavilion II, Pavilion IV, and beyond is pictured in this view taken from the promenade beside the Rotunda. The same view can be seen today. page 11 Top left — "BUILDING OF THE YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION." — Built in 1856 as the Charlottesville Presbyterian Church, replacing its 1827 structure on the same site, this building was sold to a forerunner of the YMCA in 1899. The YMCA replaced it with the present building in 1909 and added the rear addition before 1920, then sold it in 1928. It is located at the southeast corner of E. Market and 2nd St. NE, facing Jefferson-Madison Regional Library. From 1949-1967 this building was occupied by Jarman's, Inc., which sold books, stationery and office supplies. It is now occupied by VMDO Architects. Center — "CHRIST PROTESTANT EPISCOPAL CHURCH AS IT WILL APPEAR WHEN COMPLETED." — 120 W. High St., corner of W. High and 2nd St. NW. The towers illustrated in this architectural rendering were never completed. The church was begun in 1895 and replaced an earlier church which faced in the opposite direction, toward Jefferson St. Bottom right — "FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH." — This building stood at the northeast corner of E. Jefferson and 2nd St. NE. The Richardsonian Romanesque church was destroyed in a tragic fire in 1977, a year before the congregation moved to its new building on Park St. The house seen at left and the shell of the burned church were demolished in 1978 and the site is now occupied by a condominium and office complex, Queen Charlotte Square. page 12 Upper left — "CHRISTIAN CHURCH-DISCIPLES OF CHRIST." — This building still stands, as First Christian Church, at 112 E. Market St., on the southwest corner of 1st St. NE and E. Market St. Little has changed on this corner since the photo was taken, with the exception of the addition of the church's sign. Center right — "REV. GEORGE E. BOOKER, D.D." — Rev. Booker served as senior pastor of the Methodist Church from 1904-1906. Lower right — "METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH, SOUTH." — This building was located on the southwest corner of 2nd St. SW and Water St. It faced 2nd St. After its use as a church, supposedly a garage was operated out of the basement. This building was replaced by a service station, which was later remodelled into a pizza parlor, there today. The house at left still stands at 207 2nd St., housing offices of H. &amp; R. Block, and was formerly the parsonage for the church. page 13 Upper center — "PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH." — This structure, built in 1898, was the third home for the Charlottesville Presbyterian Church. It stood on the southwest corner of E. Market and 2nd St. NE. When a new sanctuary was built on Park St. (now First Presbyterian Church) in 1955, this building was bought by National Bank which leveled the site for use as a parking lot. Until 1991, the original sidewalk was still in place which gave an indication to the casual stroller of where the church entrances used to be. Left center — "THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY PARACLETE-ROMAN CATHOLIC." — This building stood at 208 E. Jefferson St. Built in 1880, it was demolished in December, 1924 to make way for the present church building, now called Holy Comforter Catholic Church. Right center — "THE HEBREW SYNAGOGUE." — Temple Beth Israel stands at the northeast corner of 3rd St. NE and E. Jefferson St. It was originally built in 1882 on the site of the current public library, formerly the Federal Building, on the northeast corner of E. Market and 2nd St. NE (see page 3). The synagogue was dismantled to make way for that building in 1905-06, and reconstructed on its present site. The modern aspect is very much like this 1906 photograph, except for the addition built to the east in 1986. Bottom — "THE HIGH STREET BAPTIST CHURCH." — A portion of this building, dedicated in 1902, still stands at 619 E. High St., on the northwest corner of 7th St. NE and E. High. In 1928 this congregation became University Baptist Church, and in 1936, long after the congregation moved to its present location at 1223 W. Main St., the High St. building was heavily damaged by fire. It was rebuilt and is now used as apartments and offices. Several of the small buttresses are still visible on the west side of the building. page 14 Upper left — " `PINE KNOT,' ALBEMARLE COUNTY RETREAT OF PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT." Lower left — "THE KITCHEN — PINE KNOT." Upper right — "SERVANT `DICK' AND HORSE `VIRGINIA CHIEF,' — PINE KNOT." — From 1905 to the end of his term in 1909, this frame house was a rural retreat for President Theodore Roosevelt and his family. It still stands on property which was originally part of the estate, "Plain Dealing," located near Keene on Rt. 712 off Rt. 20 South. Center — "MILLER MANUAL LABOR SCHOOL — MAIN BUILDING." — This remains the main building of the Miller School of Albemarle, which is operated today as a military school for boys. It is located on Rt. 635 (Miller School Road) off Rt. 250 West, south of Crozet. This scene has changed little in the intervening years. Bottom right — "FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH — COLORED." — This church building, completed about 1884, still serves its congregation at 632 W. Main St. page 15 Upper left — "HON. GEO. W. OLIVIER. Mayor of Charlottesville." — (August 1842 - 15 July 1923). Upper right — "RESIDENCE OF R. W. DUKE." — This house at 1005 E. High St., stood on or near the northeast corner of E. High St. and Locust Ave. across from Martha Jefferson Hospital. This corner is now occupied by the Physicians and Surgeons Building at 400 Locust Ave. Left center — "CAPT. MICAJAH WOODS, THIRTY-SIX YEARS PROSECUTING ATTORNEY." — (7 May 1844 - 14 March 1911). Evidently a man of great personal integrity, Woods was held in high esteem in the county. His birthplace, "Holkham," still stands in the small subdivision near Ivy which bears the estate's name. Micajah Woods died suddenly and unexpectedly in 1911 after a short illness. Lower center — "LUCIAN C. WATTS — HIGH SHERIFF OF ALBEMARLE COUNTY." — Mr. Watts married Jennie B. Burnley on 15 February 1881. Lower right — "W. L. MAUPIN, CLERK OF COUNTY COURT." — (26 March 1854 - 1923). page 16 Upper left — "A[lpheus]. V[alentine]. CONWAY OF `THE CONWAY PRINTING COMPANY.' " — (30 April 1861 - 31 August 1940). Upper right — "RESIDENCE OF W. J. TYSON." — This house was located at 907 E. High St. The site is now part of a Martha Jefferson Hospital parking lot on the corner of E. High St. and Lexington Ave. Several other houses further east on the block were torn down as the hospital expanded. Number 907 may have come down at the same time. Center right — "RESIDENCE OF DR. J. EMMETT EARLY." — This house still stands at 409 Park St. It passed out of Dr. Early's family in 1944 and has been office space since 1960. Lower center — " `WILTON,' HOME OF J. ANDERSON CHISHOLM." — Originally built in the mid-nineteenth century by the Woods family, this house ceased to be a private residence in 1988 and is now the Garnett Day Treatment Center. It is located on Rt. 20 North. Lower left — "RESIDENCE OF J. H. LINDSAY." — J. H. Lindsay was the founder of the Daily Progress. His house, at 1109 Wertland St., is now used as apartments, a fate shared by most of the fine residences on this block. Lower right — "AN ALBEMARLE BLOSSOM." — No information has been found to identify this child. page 17 Upper left — "THE PEOPLES NATIONAL BANK." — This building stands at 322 E. Main St. on the southwest corner of E. Main and 4th St. In 1909, the top story was removed after suffering damage from a fire in the nearby Charlottesville Hardware Store, and the ground floor facade has been altered. In 1917, after People's National Bank moved into a new building on the west end of this block (the current NationsBank building), Timberlake's Drugstore was established in the building pictured here. Timberlake's continues to thrive in this location. Upper right — "FRED M. WILLS OF `WILLS DRUG COMPANY.' " — Mr. Wills's business was located in the old Monticello Bank Building on the northwest corner of E. Main and 4th St. NE. The building was torn down in 1954 to make way for the Miller and Rhoads Building, which is now the operations center for Jefferson National Bank. Center — "A GALA DAY AT THE ALBEMARLE HORSE SHOW." — These show grounds, no longer in existence, were located east of Jefferson Park Ave. near what is now Robertson Ave. Bottom left — "ALBERT E. WALKER — PUBLISHER OF SPECIAL NEWSPAPER EDITIONS." — (10 January 1868 - 8 October 1918) — The guiding hand behind the original publication of this and many other regional magazines, Albert E. Walker was married to Bessie Valentine, daughter of prominent local businessman Robert Poore Valentine. Bottom right — " `CASTLE HILL,' HOME OF PRINCESS TROUBETSKOY NEE AMELIE RIVES, AUTHOR OF `THE QUICK OR THE DEAD.' " — The first portion of the house was built ca. 1764 by Dr. Thomas Walker, a leading settler in colonial Albemarle County. The brick addition pictured here was built in the 1820s during the ownership of his granddaughter Judith and her husband, William Cabell Rives. Amelie Rives was their granddaughter. The house stands off Rt. 231, northeast of Charlottesville. Though now a private residence, for a time during the 1980s it was open to the public as an historic house museum. page 18 Upper left — "JEFFERSON NATIONAL BANK." — This building was built in 1901 and stands today, minus the portico and with altered facade, at 110 E. Main St. In 1912, after being vacated by the bank, a large addition was made to the rear and it was renovated into a theatre which featured both live performances and motion pictures. Remodelling followed a 1915 fire which damaged the interior and in 1920 the present facade was built. The bank, not related to the bank currently operating under the same name, was absorbed by Peoples National Bank sometime prior to World War I. Until the 1970s this building was the Jefferson Theater, and most recently it has been the Movie Palace, a second-run movie house. Center — "H. W. TRIBBLE, D.D., PRESIDENT OF RAWLINGS INSTITUTE." No further information found. Center right — "RAWLINGS INSTITUTE" — Rawlings Institute stood at 1009 E. Jefferson St., on the northeast corner of 10th and E. Jefferson St. Founded by Baptists as the Albemarle Female Institute in 1857, the school was purchased in 1875 by Prof. R. H. Rawlings and W. P. Dickerson and became Rawlings Institute in 1897. After being sold at auction in 1909, this building was occupied by an Episcopal girls' school, St. Anne's School. In 1939, the school moved to its present quarters west of town, and is known today as St. Anne's-Belfield School. The building pictured became apartments before being torn down in 1972 to make way for medical offices. Bottom right — "THE COLONIAL HOTEL." — Located at 300 Court Square, on the southwest corner of E. Jefferson St. and 6th St. NE, this building now houses law offices. The Eagle Tavern, a frame structure, was erected here in the late 18th century, and was replaced by this brick hotel in 1854. It was operated under various names by a succession of owners until the 1960s. The buildings to the right housed businesses and were torn down in 1924-25 to make way for the Monticello Hotel, now 500 Court Square. page 19 Upper right — "J. E. WHITE — THE LAND MAN." — According to the 1906 City Directory, Mr. White's office was located at 206 5th St. NE. Center — "RESIDENCE PLANNED AND ERECTED BY T. P. CARVER." — Located at 105 W. High St., this building is now painted a pale green and is utilized as office space. The front porch has been removed. Lower left — "SURE ENOUGH OLD VIRGINIA DARKIES, UNCLE JESSE AND AUNT JULIA SCOTT, SERVANTS ON THE DICKERSON PLACE. CISMONT." — These servants may have resided at "Rougemont," the home of Capt. George C. Dickinson (not Dickerson) which is adjacent to "Castle Hill" on Rt. 231. Dickinson purchased the property, which was then called "Peachylorum," in 1854. He died in 1892, but the estate remained in his family. Lower right — "THE HISTORIC CABELL HOUSE." — This boarding house stood west of the current Amtrak station (Union Station), about where Merchant's Tire and Auto is now located at 856 W.

Manoni" were torn down ca. 1919-1922. page 20 Top center — FOX HUNTERS. — The information in the caption and the article on "ARTHUR WHITE" is all that is available. Middle center — "ALBEMARLE PIPPINS." — No further information found. Bottom — "PANTOPS." — The caption provided is inaccurate, for Pantops was never owned by George Rogers Clark. His grandfather, Jonathan Clark, was one of a group of men who obtained a grant of about 3,000 acres in this area, but this portion of the tract was not part of his share. Pantops Academy, a school for boys, was opened here in 1877 by the Rev. Edgar Woods, and was continued by his son-in-law John R. Sampson. Sampson built some of the buildings pictured, which are no longer standing. page 21 Upper left — "ERNEST P. SEABROOK." Lower left — "J. T. SEABROOK." — The Seabrook brothers were commissioned to take the photographs which illustrate this special edition of the Daily Progress.

In 1911, he was appointed Charlottesville's Corporation Court Judge, a position he held for forty years. Upper left center — "JEFFERSON SCHOOL FOR BOYS." — The Jefferson School for Boys occupied several buildings during its existence. Also known as "Social Hall," this building at 109 E. Jefferson St. was built in 1814 by Col. John Russell Jones for his residence. It still stands across from Lee Park, on the northwest corner of E. Jefferson and 2nd St. NE and houses several offices and small businesses. Lower right center — "CONSERVATORIES OF GORDON &amp; KING." — This florist stood on the corner of 14th St., NW and University Ave. By 1936, it had become Page Florists. The business ceased operation in the mid-1970s. The site is now home to a row of small shops. The house at the extreme right still stands on the northwest corner of 14th and Wertland Streets. Lower right — "OFFICES OF MAPHIS, SHAW &amp; OFFLEY." — The office building pictured here is no longer standing. Known simply as the Law Building, it was located at 212 - 214 5th St. NE, approximately where the parking lot behind 500 Court Square is today. It was torn down in the late 1950s. page 22 Upper right — "J. VINCENT PERLEY — JAMES PERLEY — J. W. PERLEY." — These three gentlemen are James Perley (center) and two of his three sons. Their furniture and undertaking business was in the building pictured below. Center right — "HANDSOME WAREROOMS OF JAMES PERLEY &amp; SONS." — This impressive building at 100 W. Main St. took up a good portion of the block. The front section of the building was very old, built before 1828. The metal facade, added sometime later to this early building, was removed around 1950, when the building was almost completely demolished and rebuilt. Robinson's, a women's clothing store, was the next occupant. The present occupant is Woolworth's. Bottom left — "THE VALLEY NATIONAL BANK OF STAUNTON, VA. ERECTED BY KING LUMBER COMPANY." — This beautiful building remains at 214 W. Beverley St. in Staunton. It is now occupied by Crestar Bank. Lower right — "FARMERS &amp; MERCHANTS BANK OF WINCHESTER, VA. ERECTED BY THE KING LUMBER COMPANY." — This building still stands at 100 N. Loudoun St. in Winchester, and continues as the home of the Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank. page 23 Upper left — "J. B. ANDREWS." — The lavishly-bewhiskered Andrews, a very successful cattle and horse breeder (see "Nightingale," below), also ran a feed store at 215 W. Main St. near what is now Old Preston Ave. That building, with its distinctive upper story windows, still stands at the current addresss of 213 W. Main St. and houses Alley Antiques. Top right — PUPPIES FROM THE `MONTICELLO KENNELS.' — Although there is no listing in the 1906 City Directory for the kennels, the owner, A[lex]. M. Whitlock, is listed as living at 1130 Little High St. He was a clerk for grocer T. W. Bailey. Since that area was practically in the country in 1906, the kennels may have been located at Whitlock's home. Far left — "CHARLES E. HUGHES." — Proprietor of the Charlottesville Bargain House, which stood at 414 E. Main Street. The building later housed Coleman's Jefferson Shop and is now an indoor mini-mall. Upper center — "H. K. HAWTHORNE." — See page 6 for an illustration of Mr. Hawthorne's office building, the Old Post Office Building. Upper Right — "E. FRANK FISHER." — Mr. Fisher was one of Charlottesville's many photographers at the turn of the century. With a few exceptions, however, they seemed to have been an itinerant lot, and Mr. Fisher appears to have departed Charlottesville by at least 1919. Several original photographs from his studio are in the Albemarle County Historical Society's collection. Lower center — " `NIGHTINGALE' A.H.S.B. 220" — one of J. B. Andrews's prize horses. Lower right — "THE LATE PROF. R. H. RAWLINGS." — (15 January 1829 - 23 August 1905). See page 18 for details on the school named after him, Rawlings Institute. Bottom right — "RESIDENCE OF J. B. ANDREWS." — This handsome house still stands at 511 Ridge St. and has been renovated into apartments. page 24 Upper left — "A SUMMER'S DAY AT FRY'S SPRINGS." Bottom right — "THE POPULAR JEFFERSON PARK HOTEL." — The terminus of a Charlottesville &amp; Albemarle Railway Company streetcar route, Fry's Spring became a popular recreation area for city residents, boasting fine food, entertainment, and healing waters. The 100-room Jefferson Park Hotel was erected there about 1892 (for its first three years it was named the Hotel Albemarle). It was dismantled following a 1910 fire. It stood on the site of the present day Jefferson Park Baptist Church. An amusement park, called "Wonderland," was also operated at Fry's Spring from 1907 to 1909. Although faith in it's health-restoring powers has waned, the spring still flows. The area continues its tradition of recreation, at the Fry's Spring Beach Club. Upper center — "J. F. HARLAN." No further information found. Upper right — "UNION DEPOT DINING ROOMSCONDUCTED BY TINDER &amp; SON" [Quintus T. and Charles J.]. — The main terminal at Union Station, which still stands today on W.

Center — "POWER HOUSE AND ICE PLANT." — Listed in the 1906 City Directory as simply "south of Main between 5th and 7th St.," the power plant of the Charlottesville Albemarle Railway Company stood near the northwest corner of Garrett St. and 4th St. SE. It was replaced in 1914 by a new plant near the Woolen Mills on the Rivanna River. This new plant extended electrical service to most areas of the city, and its abandoned building and distinctive smokestack still stand at the Woolen Mills. Right center — "W. RICE BARKSDALE." — (8 November 1859 — death date not found). Lower left — "E. G. HADEN." — (1853 - 1933). page 25 Upper left — "RESIDENCE OF S. C. CHANCELLOR." — This house, built between 1896 and 1902, stood next to the site now occupied by St. Paul's Memorial Church on University Avenue. It was rented and eventually bought from Dr. S. C. Chancellor by the Cocke sisters, who ran a boarding house there. It was demolished in 1974, the year after Miss Betty Cocke's death. Upper right — "INTERIOR OF CHANCELLOR'S `UNIVERSITY DRUG STORE.' " — A landmark on "the Corner" across University Avenue from the University of Virginia grounds, Chancellor's was known in more recent years for retaining its turn-of-the-century soda fountain. In the 1980s the business moved to more modern space in Ivy Square Shopping Center. The drugstore has since moved to its present location, Townside on Ivy Road and is now called Medical Arts West. Right center — "PLANT OF THE BROWN MILLING COMPANY." — Located directly west of the Belmont Bridge, this barn-like building still stands at 215 Avon St. It now houses a ceramics company, Ceramics and Crafts. Lower left — "FACTORY OF THE H. C. MARCHANT MANUFACTURING COMPANY."—The building pictured here has had several incarnations since its heyday as Marchant's Manufacturing, producing everything from pencils to light bulbs to silk goods. In the 1980s, it was renovated and once again sports a black and white sign painted across its facade, "D. F. Dery Silk Mills," an occupant in the 1920s. It stands near the northeast corner of Preston Ave. and Harris St. and houses office space. Lower right — "RESIDENCE OF GEORGE E. MARSHALL, SR. — LOCUST GROVE." — This house, made of a textured block resembling stone, is now painted salmon pink and stands at 525 Grove Ave. on the southwest corner of Sycamore St. and Grove Ave., a few blocks southeast of the historic Locust Grove estate. page 26 Upper left — "PLANT OF THE CHARLOTTESVILLE CANNING COMPANY." — The Charlottesville Canning Company stood in the Rose Hill neighborhood at Harris St. near Concord St. By 1919 the name of the business had changed to the Albemarle Pippin Products Company, Inc. and by 1924 it no longer appeared in city directories. Upper right — "GROCERY DEPARTMENT — J.R. HIDY &amp; COMPANY." Lower right center — "DRY GOODS DEPARTMENT — J. R. HIDY &amp; COMPANY."— J. R. Hidy &amp; Company was located at 200 W. Main St. By 1910, E. F. Robey &amp; Co. dry goods occupied the building. Leggett's department store later occupied this site beginning in the late 1930s until it moved to Fashion Square Mall in the early 1980s. Grands Clearance Center is there today. Though the shell of the building remains, the facade and interior have been completely altered. Upper left center — "HOME OF J. R. HIDY." — J. R. Hidy's residence stood at 507 N. First St. The site is now occupied by an apartment high-rise with the address of 511 N. First St. Lower left — "ROBERT C[arson]. VANDEGRIFT — J. SAMUEL FITCH." — Robert C. Vandegrift (23 January 1832 - 23 January 1921) was the grandfather of Marine Corps commandant, Major General A. A. Vandegrift. General Vandegrift led the invasion of Guadalcanal in World War II. His boyhood home was at 112 E. High St. The family surname is more often spelled "Vandergrift." Bottom right — " `THE BOOK STORE' OF A. C. BRECHIN &amp; SON." — Brechin's was located at 200 E. Main St., on the southeast corner of E. Main and 2nd St., SE. The building was probably torn down in 1931, when Citizens Bank, one of the few banks to open during the Great Depression, was built on this site. Citizens Bank is now Central Fidelity Bank. page 27 Upper left — "THE CARTER HOUSE." — The Carter House stood for many years, serving the rail-traveling public, across W. Main St. from Union Station. Later, a large addition was built in front of the building and it became the Queen Charlotte Hotel. In 1953-54, with rail traffic declining, the Queen Charlotte was torn down. A used car lot occupies the approximate site today, immediately west of the bridge over the railroad tracks. Upper right — "INTERIOR OF SPITZER'S FINE GROCERY ESTABLISHMENT." — The building which housed Spitzer's is still standing at 413 E. Main St. The jewelry store Gemstones occupies the space seen in this photo. Left center — "W. A. LANKFORD." — Remnants of Mr. Lankford's horticultural business may still be evident in the wooded area across Cherry Ave. from Oakwood Cemetery. Lankford Ave., off Ridge St., is named for him. In 1929, King Greenhouses (see page 21) purchased the Lankford business. Walter Page and William-Holloway, proprietors of King Greenhouses, owned two other greenhouses when they bought Lankford's. Right center — "LANDRUM BROS., ARLINGTON MILLS." — The Landrum Brothers, C. S. and Frank M., were sumac grinders (for tanning) and their plant was on Carlton Road near the C &amp; O tracks, possibly where the Carlton Industrial Park is today. In later years, the Young Tanning Company was in that location. Although the Magazine says the brothers both lived in Luray, Frank, who oversaw the business, had a residence in Charlottesville at 906 E. Jefferson St. Bottom left — "DRY GOODS EMPORIUM OF B[enjamin]. F. DICKERSON." — In the late 1890s, Dickerson's occupied 204 E. Main St., located west of the current Standard Drug. By the time this Magazine was printed, he had moved up the block to 212 - 214 E. Main St. Dickerson occupied the building until the latter 1920s, and from the early 1930s until about 1981 it was home to C. H. Williams. In recent years it became Smith's of Bermuda and now is home to a shop appropriately named Tiffany's Emporium. Bottom right — "THE LETERMAN COMPANY'S BIG DEPARTMENT STORE." — Leterman's, one of the new breed of "department stores," opened in 1899 on the corner of W. Main St. and 1st St., NE. In ensuing years, the two domes which enlivened the city's skyline were removed. Leterman's was in business for about ten years and then the building was sold in 1911. The new owner removed two of the central bays and moved the corner pavilion to the west. The eastern portion of the building was then sold to Jefferson National Bank which added a new facade and moved into it from its former quarters across the street (see page 18). This space is now home to H &amp; M Shoes, while the remainder of old Leterman's is occupied by several businesses and a residential apartment. page 28 Upper left — "PROPERTY OWNED BY GEORGE E. MARSHALL, SR." — This photo shows Grove Ave. looking southwest from near the corner of Sycamore and Grove. This neighborhood, just beginning to be developed at the time of the photo, was on property carved out of "Locust Grove."

It and its clapboard neighbor across the street are still standing. Center left — "J. J. UTZ." No further information found. Upper left center — "MICHIE'S WHOLESALE GROCERY ESTABLISHMENT." — In 1906, Michie's was on the corner of South and 1st St. at 100 E. South St. A third story was added to the building in 1915.

Main St., which is the current address of the Charlottesville Downtown Foundation, next to Gitchell's Studio. Bottom center — "WADDELL'S UP-TO-DATE SHOE STORE." — Waddell's, a downtown fixture for many years, stood first at 306 E. Main and then moved to the adjacent building at 308 E. Main in the mid-1940s, next to Peoples Bank (today's Nations Bank). The shoe store went out of business around 1970. The building and two buildings to the east have been replaced by an addition to the bank and the Milgraum Center. page 29 Upper left — "FACTORY OF THE WAY CARRIAGE COMPANY." — The factory was located on the southeast corner of 3rd St., NE and Water St., at 300 - 304 E. Water St. Several blocks of the south side of Water St., including this site, have been used as parking lots in recent years. A new city parking garage is now under construction there. Upper right — "ONE SECTION OF THE CHARLOTTESVILLE AGRICULTURAL AND IRON WORKS." — This firm had buildings on both sides of the 400 block of W.

Lower left center — "OFFICE AND PLANING MILL OF CHARLOTTESVILLE LUMBER COMPANY." — The exterior of this building has changed little in the ensuing eighty-six years, and is easily recognized. It stands on the corner of Avon and Garrett streets, directly west of the Belmont Bridge at 310 Avon St. Charlottesville Lumber became Better Living and was in this location until the firm moved to its present location on Rt. 29 N. outside of town. Their custom millwork shop still occupies the building.

Main St. near the west end of the present Downtown Mall, this building was torn down in the early 1960s during urban renewal on Vinegar Hill. Upper right — "JOHNSON &amp; CO.'S `UNIVERSITY FRUIT STORE.' " Center right — "JOHNSON &amp; CO.'S `UNIVERSITY DINING ROOM.' " — This business, popular with University students, opened in 1895. The building was razed in the 1930s when the University Theatre was built on the site. That building has since been converted into business and residential space. Center — "SHAPERO'S DEPARTMENT STORE." — Shapero's conducted business at 205 - 207 W. Main St., now part of the western-most block of the Downtown Mall.

Main, at the junction of Preston Ave. (now Old Preston Ave.) and W. Main St. It was replaced by the present building in about 1920. Victory Shoe Store has occupied 219 W. Main since 1922. The shoe store is so named because it opened on the day World War I ended. Center — "CHARLOTTESVILLE WOOLEN MILLS — ALBEMARLE'S LEADING INDUSTRY." — The Woolen Mills is at the eastern end of what is now Market St. The community around it was, and continues to be, a distinctive neighborhood, its residents taking pride in the area's association with the old mill and its stability. After World War II, demand for its products dwindled and the Woolen Mills struggled for several years before finally closing in the early 1960s. The buildings pictured here no longer stand, although at least two other mill structures are still in use as residential and warehouse spaces. Lower left — "ELLIOTT &amp; CARTER'S FAMILY MARKET." — Although the article for this meat market states that it was at 120 East Main St., according to the city directory and Sanborn fire insurance maps, it was actually at 120 West Main St. It stood on the southeast corner of Main and 2nd St. NW, where the Young Men's Shop is located today. page 32 Upper left — "HOLSINGER'S `UNIVERSITY STUDIO.' " — Noted local photographer Rufus Holsinger occupied this studio at 719 - 721 W. Main St. for many years.

Gibson's Radiator Service is located on the site today. Upper right — "MODERN PLANT OF THE CHARLOTTESVILLE ICE CO." — This cold storage company became Elliott's Ice Company after 1920 and was sold to Monticello Dairy in 1959. Elliott's continued to operate until 1970. Its buildings were purchased by the City's Redevelopment and Housing Authority in 1971 and were demolished in a city redevelopment project in 1973. The old ice company site occupied the block on the west side of 4th St. between South and Garrett. Center — "ONE OF GILMORE FURNITURE CO.'S MAJESTIC MOVING VANS." — This handsome hitch, facing east, was standing on the railroad bridge on W. Main St., with the Carter House (see page 27) in the left background. Gilmore Furniture Company occupied "warerooms" on the north side of the 300 block of E. Main St. and its store was across the street at 320 E. Main. Now Gilmore, Hamm and Snyder, the store recently relocated to Seminole Square Shopping Center on Rt. 29 North.

Lower left — "BALZ'S PEERLESS CONFECTIONERY ESTABLISHMENT." — Balz's shop was located on the northwest corner of E. Main and 3rd St., NE.

Market St. on the north side was razed when the Daily Progress built their new plant on that site. That building now houses the United Way and other nonprofit agencies. The corner of E. Market and 4th St., where the Burgess business was, is now a small parking lot. Lower right — "CARVER'S ELEGANT LIVERY STABLES." — In 1906, C. L. Carver had recently bought this flourishing stable from Grafton D. Payne (see page 38), and the business was still known as Payne's Livery.

FULLER'S SUPERB MILLINERY HEADQUARTERS." — There is conflicting information about where Mrs. Fuller's shop was located. The accompanying article puts it at 303 E. Main, the current site of Advance Auto on the northeast corner of 3rd St. NE and E. Main St. The 1906-07 City Directory places it at number 310, site of the Milgraum building on the south side of E. Main St. The millinery shop had moved around through the years, and it is possible that Mrs. Fuller simply upped stakes and moved again shortly after this Magazine was published in 1906. Upper right — "MUNDIE'S FINE GROCERY ESTABLISHMENT." — Mundie's, at 209 E. Main St., was located where today's Central Place, a group of shops and offices on the Downtown Mall, takes up the northeast corner of 2nd St. NE and E. Main St. Center — "HANDSOME STORE OF T. J.

Later, the Monticello Drug Co. did business there. The entire block was torn down when the Market St. parking garage was built around 1969. Lower left — "MEAT MARKET OF C. M. WOOD &amp; CO." — As there is no longer a 305 E. Main St., the building out of which Wood &amp; Co. operated probably became part of the space occupied by Advance Auto, at 301 E. Main St. Lower right — "IRVING &amp; CO.'S LIVERY STABLES." — Profiting from the carriage hire trade brought in by rail travelers, Irving &amp; Co.'s Livery Stables stood just around the corner of 7th St. and E. Main from the then-new C &amp; O Station (see page 9). It stood about where the new office building occupied by Feil, Deinlein, Pettit, and Williams is located at 530 E. Main St. page 36 Upper left — "GENERAL STORE OF J. L. MORROW." — J. L. Morrow's store was near the top of Vinegar Hill at 287 W. Main St. The building on this site, along with the rest of the 200 block of W. Main, was razed during urban renewal in the early 1960s. The street connecting Ridge St. and McIntire Rd. (now called Ridge-McIntire) was put through the site shortly thereafter. Upper center — "Z. N. SHACKLEFORD." — Shackleford, who died shortly before publication of the Magazine, was a grocer whose store stood at 423 E. Main St. That number no longer exists. The store stood about where the Masonic Temple building, now 425 E. Main, was built in 1959. The ground floor of this building is occupied by Ginn's office supply. Upper right — "HEADQUARTER'S [sic] CHARLOTTESVILLE HORSE AND MULE COMPANY." — The street number listed in the Magazine for this livestock business is 106. It was, in fact, 601, and the building pictured here still stands at the northeast corner of 6th St., NE and E. Market St. It has been used as office space since the late 1940s. The Colonial Hotel (see page 18) stands in the background at left. Center — "MISS ZIMMERMANN'S MILLINERY EMPORIUM." — Miss Zimmerman conducted her shop from ca. 1900 into the 1920s at 222 E. Main St., which today uses the number 220. The building stands next to Williams Corner Book Store, which has recently expanded into the space. Williams' building was built in 1883 as M. Kaufman's Sons, a men's clothing store. Lower right center — "V[ernon]. P. BRYANT." — (15 October 1876 - 22 March 1957). Apparently Mr. Bryant was in the electrical business for himself, but the location of his business is uncertain. Vernon P. Bryant is listed as a carpenter in the 1906 City Directory. His residential address is listed as "King w. of 9th." Lower left — "HORSEMEN'S HEADQUARTERS — GOODYEAR &amp; ROBERTSON." — The buildings pictured here still stand on 4th St. NE, between E. Market and E. Main St. The upper facade is basically unchanged, although the ground floor entrances have been altered. Cardinal Uniforms and Pockets Restaurant now do business here (110 - 114 4th St. NE). Lower right — " `LOG CABIN' BAR AND RESTAURANT." — On the northwest corner of 5th and E. Market St., the distinctive Log Cabin was razed in 1910, after the city "went dry." Until the sidewalk on 5th St. was replaced recently, the brass letters "B A R" could be seen imbedded in the concrete. Impressions left by a second set of letters are still visible in the sidewalk around the corner on Market St., marking the location of the business. The Chamber of Commerce building stands here now. page 37 Upper left — "F. H. WISEMAN." Lower left — "WISEMAN'S UNIVERSITY BILLIARD PARLORS." — Mr. Wiseman conducted his University Billiard Parlor at 1325 W. Main St., a block east of his competitor John LaRowe. Today this end of W. Main is called University Ave., and Wiseman's was located west of today's Howard Johnson's and the building which formerly housed the University Theatre (at 1319 University Ave.). Upper center — "A BUSY DAY AT WARD'S SALES STABLE." — According to the 1907 Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps, Ward's grocery-feed-livery complex stood next to the Armory which in turn stood next to old City Hall on the southeast corner of 5th St., NE and E. Market. The business was located across the street from its competitor, the Charlottesville Horse and Mule Co. (see page 36). Center — "CAPT. ADOLPH RUSSOW." — (9 April 1851 - 8 October 1923). Russow, born in Germany, came to the United States in 1868. After becoming manager of the Monticello Wine Company, founded in 1873, he lived in a company house at what is now 212 Wine St. The Monticello Wine Company gave him the house after selling off its stock and closing its doors in 1916, a "victim" of state-adopted prohibition. Upper right — "WILLIAM GARTH." — (1863 - 1934) — Garth Rd. is named for Mr. Garth, whose home "Ingleside" has only recently been sold out of the Garth family. For many years Billy Garth's handsome stable and twin on his daughter Bertha Garth Jones's farm, Inglecress, stood opposite each other on Garth Rd. When Inglecress was subdivided several years ago, that stable was moved across the road to Ingleside. Lower right — "J. J. THOMAS." No further information found. page 38 Upper left — "VIA'S COAL AND WOOD YARD AND GROCERY." — Near the junction of Preston Ave. and the railroad tracks, just west of Harris St., Via's probably stood about where Napa Auto Parts store is today. King Lumber Company's wood yard was also in the same vicinity. This photograph shows the small grocery store associated with the coal yard business. In the distant right background is the Marchant Manufacturing building (see page 24). The Charlottesville Canning Company (see page 26) may be the building at left. By 1919, Via's had become John Porter's coal yard. Upper center — "E[mory]. F. MARKWOOD." — Living on Ridge St., E. F. Markwood had only a short walk each morning to his shop at 211 W. Main St., which was occupied by Spirit Vision Galleries until its move to the east end of the mall in 1992. The crumbling facade of this building was carefully removed and rebuilt about 1990. Upper right — "FLANNAGAN &amp; ALLEGREE'S SPLENDID NEW STABLES." — This drawing depicts the building which once stood at the southwest corner of E. Market St. and 5th St. NE. Center — "HEADQUARTERS MODEL STEAM LAUNDRY." — Sitting at the edge of the old Vinegar Hill neighborhood, on the northwest corner of W. Main and 4th St. NW, the Model Steam Laundry occupied this building until about 1950 followed by the Midway Laundry until 1963. It was replaced by a new building for the Virginia Telephone and Telegraph Co., now Centel. Lower left — "PAYNE'S PALACE STABLES." — Not to be confused with Payne's Livery (or Carver's, see page 33) located four blocks to the west, the Palace Stable sat in the block opposite the present-day Omni Hotel at the west end of the Downtown Mall. In 1906, the same year the Magazine was published, the first automobile appeared in town. Livery stables quickly evolved into service stations under pressure from the ever-increasing stream of automobiles. Payne's struggled on as a stable for a time. By the 1920s a taxi stand was on this site, and by the late 1950s the livery buildings no longer appear on the Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps. Bottom right — "T. J. WILLIAMS, CHIEF OF FIRE DEPARTMENT." — (5 August 1832 - 25 November 1922). Born in Philadelphia, Williams became Charlottesville's Fire Chief in 1853, shortly after his arrival in town. He held the post until his death. page 39 Upper center — "PURE BREAD HEREFORD CALVES, SIRED BY IMPORTED SALISBURY." — As stated in the accompanying article about the Keswick estate "Castalia," these cattle were among the prizewinning stock bred by Murray Boocock. The estate still exists under the same name, though the main house at Castalia was torn down in 1987. Lower left — "FRAY'S GENERAL COUNTRY STORE." — This store burned down and a new building, now Advance Mills Store, was built on the old foundations. It is located along Rt. 743 north of Charlottesville. Lower right — "FINE MILL PLANT OF J. M. FRAY &amp; CO." — Like the general store, Fray's mill was also a victim of fire. Its dam on the north fork of the Rivanna River is still used to generate electricity. Lower center — "GENERAL VIEW OF THE FRAY PROPERTY — ADVANCE MILLS." — Little has changed in this pastoral scene. The house and schoolhouse at left are still standing. page 40 Upper left — "COAL YARDS OF JAMES A. LEITCH." — Charlottesville had a number of coal yards, with Leitch's standing at 616 W. Main St., on the south side of the street east of Union Station. Although the yard itself was there for many years, Mr. Leitch appears to have come on the scene in 1903. By the 1920s it was Burley's Coal Yard. Upper right — "ESTABLISHMENT OF D. L. MAUCH." — This plain but attractive building stood on the north side of the 400 block of E. Market St. The Daily Progress built its new offices and plant here, later completing take-over of the block by adding a parking lot in 1967-68. Center left — "J. C. MATTHEWS." — Matthews's bakery was on the north side of the 300 block of E. Main St., in about the middle of the block. Until recently, the Shoe Center occupied number 313, which was converted into commercial and residential space in 1991. The building dates to the 1860s, and the facade was rebuilt about 1914. The storefront has been altered over the years. Right center — "H. M. GLEASON." — Gleason's store, which sold everything from groceries to hay and feed, did business at 401 E. Main St. on the northeast corner of 4th St., NE and E. Main from 1873 until 1944. The present building was built in 1928. Around 1920, the H. M. Gleason, Inc. location on Garrett St. was built as a warehouse for farm implements and machinery, while the Main St. store concentrated more on the grocery line. The Garrett St. store remains in operation today. Lower left — "HARLAN'S PROGRESSIVE GROCERY." — Located at 600 Monticello Ave., Harlan's was on the southeast corner of Monticello Ave. and 6th St. SE. The site is empty today, though the adjacent house is very similar in form to Harlan's building and probably dates from the same period. Lower right — "ONE FLOOR OF THE GILMORE FURNITURE CO.'S STORE." — (see page 32 — "One of Gilmore Furniture Co.'s Majestic Moving Vans.") page 41 Top — " `OAK RIDGE,' NELSON COUNTY, OWNED BY MR. THOMAS F. RYAN." — The original house, seen in this photograph, was built ca. 1800 by Robert Rives, father of William Cabell Rives (who later resided at "Castle Hill" in Albemarle County, see page 17). The estate was purchased in 1901 by wealthy financier Thomas Fortune Ryan, who added the portico seen in this view. Beginning about 1910 he enlarged the house to its present size of over 14,000 square feet. Ryan's "Oak Ridge" included over 7,000 acres. New owners began restoration of this magnificent home and estate in 1990. They are attempting to keep the remaining 4870 acres intact. Lower left — " `HILLTOP' — HOME OF MR. BARNES COMPTON." — No further information found. Lower right — "RESIDENCE OF MRS. MARY C. GOOCH." — Mrs. Gooch's boarding house was on the northeast corner of 3rd St., NE and E. Market St. The house is still there, housing several businesses, including a coin shop and a dance studio. It nestles comfortably in the midst of a few old trees, but the front porches which gave it its residential quality have been removed. page 42 Upper left — "J. L. DUFFILL." — The city's professional huckster, Mr. Duffill (or Duffell, as he is listed in the 1906-07 City Directory) both resided and conducted his business on 10th St. NW in the block just off W. Main St. Upper center — "W. SAM BURNLEY, ATTORNEY AT LAW." — (3 September 1868 - 25 March 1942) — Mr. Burnley's office is listed at 217 - 219 Court St., though the name of this street had been changed several years prior to 1906 to 5th St., NE. This street leads up to the Albemarle County Court House from Market St. Not mentioned in the caption under his photograph was the fact that he was also a Justice of the Peace. Lower center — "C. N. BOLSER." — see page 35, "F. G. Hicks." Lower left — "ANDERSON BROS., `UNIVERSITY BOOK STORE' " — The bookstore division of Anderson Brothers, Inc. was sold by former local owners in July of 1988 and is now called Follett's University Bookstore. Under the new ownership it continues to supply students and "townies" with textbooks and office supplies. Business is still conducted from this building with its metal-clad facade on University Ave., in the college shopping district known as "the Corner," and there is also an outlet on Arlington Blvd. page 43 Upper center — " `EDNAM,' HOME OF E. O. MEYER, ESQ." — The impressive manor house of E. O. Meyer still stands on Rt. 250 West (Ivy Road) perched on the hill east of the entrance to the Boar's Head Inn. Ednam saw several subsequent owners as the necessity for, and funds to maintain, such grand houses faded. Now the centerpiece of a residential development, plans to redesign the interior into condominium apartments were recently announced. Right center — "MAIN BUILDING OF CROZET COOPERAGE CO." — The office for this company still stands in downtown Crozet, and is now the home of locally famous Crozet Pizza at the junction of Rt. 810 and Rt. 240. The cooperage was organized in 1902 and closed in 1930. Center — "W. B. GARDNER." — Mr. Gardner lived at 901 E. Market St. The Central Coal Company of Gardner and his partner F. G. Brooks was located just southwest of Way's carriage manufactory (see page 29) on Water St. Lower left — "GENERAL STORE OF THE EARLYSVILLE SUPPLY CO." — No longer standing, this store was located near the fork in the road at the center of old Earlysville. page 44 Upper right — "CHARLOTTESVILLE HARDWARE COMPANY." — The building pictured, at 316 E. Main St., was destroyed by fire in 1909. The company rebuilt on the same site. The business continued for nearly 80 years after the catastrophic fire, moving to a new building on Rio Road in 1975. The move proved disastrous for business, since it was several years ahead of its time in moving to what is now a heavily-developed commercial section of the county. The company filed for bankruptcy in 1978. In the original location, the Hardware Store Restaurant thrives, displaying on its walls items once in great demand from its predecessor's customers. page 45 Center — "FRENCH COACH STALLION `ARLEQUIN' 3540." — The Charlottesville and Ablemarle [sic] Horse Company — W[illiam]. B. Colthurst, manager of the Horse Company, farmed the land next to Farmington which eventually became the Colthurst Farm development on Garth Road. Bottom — "R. L. THOMAS, HOT WATER AND STEAM HEATING, PLUMBING AND GAS FITTING." — How could anyone resist this beautifully arranged display of R. L. Thomas's wares? He evidently moved frequently. He is listed in the 1906-07 City Directory at 117 W. Main, approximately where the Metropolitain Restaurant is now located. About ten years later, Rufus Holsinger took a similar photograph of Thomas's store, looking toward the front of the building, where the number 228 is plainly visible above the door. Other directories give still other addresses.</field>
