      <field name="fulltext">A STATEMENT OF THE COURSE OF INSTRUCTION, EXPENSES, &amp;c., IN THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. MATRICULATION. To be admitted into the University, the student must be sixteen years of age; but the Faculty are authorized to dispense with this requisition in the case of application for admission by two brothers, one of whom is under the age of sixteen. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he cannot be received but on producing &amp; certificate from such seminary, or other evidence satisfactory to the Faculty, with respect to his general good conduct. Every student is free to attend the schools of his choice, and no other than he chooses; with the condition that he shall attend at least three professors, unless he has the written authority of his parent or guardian, or the Faculty shall for good cause shown allow him to attend less than three. Should he be twenty-one years of age, or more, he is exempt from this condition. Before a student matriculates, he is furnished with a copy of the laws, which he is required to read. On matriculating, he signs a written declaration, that he will conform to those laws, and if he be a resident student, that he has deposited with the Patron all the funds in his possession. COURSE OF INSTRUCTION. The session commences on the 1st of October, and continues without interruption until the 29th of June. The mode of instruction is by lectures and text-books, accompanied by daily and stated examinations. In each school there are three regular lectures a week, besides many others suited to the several subjects into which the school is divided. 3 SCHOOLS. I.âANCIENT LANGUAGES. PROFESSOR HARRISON. ASSISTANT INSTRUCTOR, EDWARD S. JOYNES, A. M. In this school are taught the Latin and Greek Languages; the Greek and Roman History, Geography, and Literature; and the Hebrew Language. The instruction is given partly by lectures and examinations, and partly by comments on portions of the text-books appointed to be read by the students. In Latin there are two classes, a Junior and a Senior, and so in Greek. The text-books used in the several classes are chiefly the following: 1. In the Junior Latin Class: Zumpt's Latin Grammar, the Professor's Exposition of some of the laws of the Latin Language, Virgil, Horace, Cicero's Orations and his EpistolÃ¦ ad Diversos, Terence, and CÃ¦sar's Commentaries; the last chiefly with a view to the written exercises. 2. In the Senior Latin Class: Zumpt's Latin Grammar, the Professor's Exposition, Horace, Juvenal, Livy and Tacitus. 3. In the Junior Greek Class: KÃ¼hner's Elementary Greek Grammar, Xenophon's Anabasis, an oration of Demosthenes, Herodotus, and a play of Euripides or Ãschylus. The Greek-English Lexicon of Liddell and Scott is that preferred. 4. In the Senior Greek Class: KÃ¼hner's Larger Greek Grammar, Euripides, Sophocles, Thucydides, and Homer. 5. For the Roman History, studied in the Senior Latin Class, Arnold's History of Rome is used as a text-book. Niebuhr's History of Rome, and the History of Rome published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, and the maps of ancient Italy published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, or Findlay's Ancient Atlas, are recommended. 6. For the Ancient History of Greece, studied in the Senior Greek Class, the History of Greece published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, or Thirlwall's, or Grote's History of Greece, and the maps published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, or Findlay's Ancient Atlas, are recommended. It is expected of the students of Latin and Greek, that they will read in their rooms such authors and parts of authors, prescribed by the Professor, as cannot be read in the lecture-room;âe.g. Cicero's Epistles to Atticus, his Orations (selected), and Treatise De Republica, Sallust, Virgil, Terence, Plautus, Ãschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Demosthenes, Ãschines, Thucydides, Plato, &amp;c. As an essential part of the plan of instruction, the students of each class are required to furnish written exercises. These consist in the conversion of Latin or Greek into English, and of English into Latin or Greek. The exercises are examined by the Professor and the errors marked; they are then returned to the students, and the corrections stated and explained in the presence of the class. 7. Hebrew: The text-books are Biblia Hebraica, Nordheimer's or Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar, amd Gesenii Lexicon Manuale Hebr. et Chald., or Sauerwein's edition of Rehkopf's Lex. Hebr. Chald. In the written translations required as a test of the qualifications of candidates for degrees, the passages used are selected by the committee of examination, not from the portions of authors which have been read and explained in the lecture-room, but at will from the classic writers generally. II.âMODERN LANGUAGES. PROFESSOR SCHELE DE VERE. ASSISTANT INSTRUCTOR, S. E. W. BECKER. The subjects taught in this school are: 1. The French, Italian, Spanish and German Languages, and the English in its Anglo-Saxon form. 2. The Literature of these Languages and the history of each idiom. 3. The History and Geography of Europe, from the fall of the Roman Empire to the present day. Instruction, also, is given in Comparative Philology and the principles of the Science of Language. The influence of the history of nations on their language and literature is explained and exemplified by extracts from their respective authors, and constant attention given to the connection between Philology and Ethnology. There are three classes in French and two in German, one for beginners, the others for more advanced students; and the same anangement is made, when necessary, in the other languages. Opportunity is also given, in private, to practice speaking the languages. The method of instruction is by lectures, examinations, written exercises, and comments on the text books as read in the lecture-room; the principal classic authors in each language being used for this purpose. Two degrees in this school are required for the degree of A. M. III.âMATHEMATICS. PROFESSOR COURTENAY. ASSISTANT INSTRUCTOR, ALEXANDER L. NELSON. In this school there are four classes. Of these, the Junior commences with the theory of Arithmetic, the student being supposed to have rendered himself practically familiar with its various rules before entering the University. The elements of Algebra are then taught, and after the first difficulties are mastered, the subjects of Algebra and Synthetic Geometry are pursued simultaneously. In the second or Intermediate Class, the course of Algebra, commenced in the preceding class, is completed, and there are taught successively the theory of Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, with the application of the former to the measurement of heights and distances, and of the latter to Nautical Astronomy, the theory and practice of Land Surveying and Levelling, Navigation, and Descriptive Geometry, with its applications to Spherical Projections, Shadows, and Perspective. The Senior Class begins with the subject of Analytical Geometry, and subsequently studies the Differential Calculus, concluding the course of Pure Mathematics with the Integral Calculus. There is also a class of Mixed Mathematics, designed exclusively for such of the more advanced students as may desire to study the subjects taught therein. The course embraces the mathematical investigation of the general laws of equilibrium and motion, both of solids and fluids, with a variety of applications, especially to Physical Astronomy. The instruction in each class is conveyed partly by lectures, and partly by the systematic study of approved text-books, the student being assisted by full and frequent explanations from the Professor, and being constantly subjected to rigid examinations. The progress of the student in every class is also tested by his being required to perform written exercises, in which the principles acquired are applied to the solution of particular problems. The text books used are:âFor the Junior Class, Lacroix' or Davies' Arithmetic, Davies' Bourdon's Algebra, and Legendre's Geometry. For the Intermediate Class, Bourdon's Algebra, Legendre's Geometry and Trigonometry, Davies' Surveying and Descriptive Geometry. For the Senior Class, Davies' Analytical Geometry, Young's Differential Calculus, and Young's Integral Calculus. For the class of Mixed Mathematics, Pratt's Mechanical Philosophy. Any student entering the school has the privilege of attending all or any of the classes, as he may elect, and if prepared to enter an advanced class, may often find it highly advantageous to review his previous studies by an attendance on a lower class also. IV.âNATURAL PHILOSOPHY. PROFESSOR FRANCIS H. SMITH. There are three classes in this school: the Junior and Senior classes of Natural Philosophy, and the class of Geology and Mineralogy. The Junior course commences with an exposition of the leading doctrines of equilibrium and motion, so far as they can be established by an easy deduction from admitted axioms, aided, when necessary, by simple geometrical theorems. Notice is taken of the application of these doctrines to machinery, and to the figure and motions of the planetary bodies. This is followed by an account of the structure and physical properties of fluids, including a discussion of the laws of their pressure and motion, with their applications, and the theory and construction of the principal Pneumatic and Hydraulic machines. The relations between the several forms of matter, and the laws of Endosmose and Capillarity, are then presented. The latter part of the course is devoted to Acoustics, Optics, Heat, Electricity and Magnetism. Full and frequent experimental illustrations of the subjects taught are given, whenever practicable. The course of study in the Senior class embraces a mathematical discussion of the doctrines of Statics and Dynamics, the laws of Friction and Strength of Materials, concluding with Pur Astronomy. The class in Mineralogy and Geology is first occupied with a study of the formation, properties and localities of the leading minerals, and the simpler methods of recognition and analysis. This is succeeded by a presentation of the leading facts and generalizations of geology, illustrated by sections and diagrams. Throughout the course, specimens of the most important minerals and rocks are exhibited. Text-Books.âElements of Mech. Philosophy, by Professor W. B. Rogers; Lardner's Hand-books; Smith's Mechanics; Dana's Mineralogy; Lyell's or Richardson's Elementary Geology. V.âSCHOOL OF CHEMISTRY AND PHARMACY. PROFESSOR S. MAUPIN. In this school there are three regular meetings of the class weekly, of one hour and a half in duration. One hour is usually devoted to the lecture, and half an hour to the examination of the class on the preceding lecture. The course of lectures commences with the consideration of the imponderable agents: Heat, Light and Electricity. These agents play an important part in chemical changes, and due space is given to their consideration. The subject of inorganic Chemistry is then taken up. The nomenclature, and chemical symbols and notation are explained. The non-metallic elements, together with their combinations with oxygen and with each other are considered. The general principles of Chemical Philosophy then pass in review, including Affinity, the Lau's of Combination, the Atomic Theory and Theory of Volumes, Electro-chemical Decomposition, &amp;c. The consideration of the Metals comes next in order. After noticing their general properties, the general characters of their salts, Haloid and Amphide, the Binary Theory of salts, the doctrine of Crystallization, Isomorphism, &amp;c. , they are taken up individually. Their history and properties are given, and their combinations with oxygen and other non-metallic elements, together with their saline combinations, are considered. The concluding part of the course is devoted to Organic Chemistry, including a notice of the more important products of vegetable and animal life, the modifications of organic compounds by artificial processes, their transformations by the action of ferments and other agencies, the doctrine of compound radicals, &amp;c. , &amp;c. Throughout the course, the applications of the facts and principles of the science to Medicine, to Agriculture and other arts, are noticed and illustrated. Text-books recommendedâFownes and Rogers' Turner. The course of instruction in Pharmacy, designed for the benefit of the students of Medicine attending this school, commences about the first of April, and occupies the time devoted to one of the regular meetings of the class weekly, until the close of the session. VI.âMEDICINE. PROFESSOR HOWARD. In this school are taught the Principles and the Practice of Medicine, Obstetrics and Medical Jurisprudence. To allow the me dical student time to attain proficiency in Anatomy and Physiology, Chemistry and Materia Medica, before he is required to apply these branches in the study of the Principles and the Practice of Medicine, the course is opened with Medical Jurisprudence, which is followed by Obstetrics, and both are completed before the Principles or the Practice of Medicine are entered upon. MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. The lectures on this branch show the aid which legislation and the administration of the laws derive from medicine, and consist chiefly in the application of the principles of medical science to the elucidation and administration of the laws, and the legal decisions in cases of insanity, every variety of mental impairment, crime, &amp;c. , &amp;c. Text-Booksâthe Professor's Outlines, and Beck or Taylor. OBSTETRICS. The lectures on this branch comprehend an account of all labors, natural, preternatural and instrumental; the professional assistance to be afforded in each, the treatment of the female before, during and after delivery, and the diseases of infancy. The lectures are amply illustrated by specimens and plates; and all manual evolutions, and the application of instruments, are demonstrated on the improved phantome of Hebermehl. The students also practice manual and instrumental delivery on the manikin. Text-Bookâthe last edition of Meigs' Midwifery. THE PRINCIPLES OF MEDICINE. The Principles of Medicine, as taught in this school, comprise General Pathology, and a brief view of General Therapeutics; also Etiology, Nosology, Semeiology, Diagnosis and Prognosis. The nature and division of causes are first considered, which introduces the student to their effectsâdisease. Pathology proper is next considered under the two forms, Functional and Structural diseases. After the student thoroughly understands the nature of the causes of diseases, their divisions, modes of operation, and the resulting effects upon function and structure, a general view is given of the influences that can be brought to remove or counteract their effects. And the course on the Principles is then concluded by the consideration of nosology, semeiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and the different modes of death. Text-BooksâWood's General Pathology and General Therapeutics, in the last edition of his Practice. PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, OR SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SPECIAL THERAPEUTICS. As the most natural and practically useful arrangement, all local diseases are classified and treated of according to their locality, or the organ or set of organs which they affect; whilst general diseases are arranged altogether pathologically. Much attention is given to Physical Diagnosis. Pathological Anatomy occupies a conspicuous place in the course, and is illustrated by Carswell's large and splendid colored plates, and, when practicable, by specimens. Text-BookâWood's Practice of Medicine, last edition. VII.âCOMPARATIVE ANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY AND SURGERY. PROFESSOR CABELL. The heading indicates the subjects taught in this school, and the order in which they are discussed. In the first part of the course, the Professor presents a general outline of the Animal Kingdom, by demonstrating such of the leading facts of Comparative Anatomy as may serve to indicate the natural affinities between the different members of the animal series, and to furnish a basis for a natural Zoological classification. In the second division of the course, which is mainly devoted to the study of Human Physiology, the peculiarities of structure of inferior animals are again noticed, with reference, especially, to the varieties of the same organ in different animals, in order to exhibit the simplest conditions of structure essential to its office, and to indicate the uses of the superadded parts in the more complicated forms. The third portion of the course is exclusively devoted to the study of the Principles and Practice of Surgery. Text-Books.âThe Professor's "Syllabus of Lectures on Comparative Anatomy and Physiology;" Carpenter's Elements of Physiology; Kirkes' and Paget's Human Physiology; Druitt's Modern Surgery. VIII.âLECTURESHIP OF ANATOMY, MATERIA MEDICA AND THERAPEUTICS. DR. J. S. DAVIS. ANATOMY. In this class are taught Special and Surgical Anatomy. The lectures are illustrated by fresh subjects, by wet and dry anatomical preparations, and by a series of colored drawings. Text-BookâWilson's Anatomy. MATERIA MEDICA. The course on this subject embracesâ 1. General Therapeutics, or an account of the effects of the various classes of remedies on the organism, their modus operandi, and their applications to the relief of disease. 2. A detailed account of medicinal agents, in their commercial history, physical properties, chemical habitudes, pharmaceutical preparations and effects. The means of illustration in Materia Medica are ample, comprising a full series of specimens of medicines in their various states, and an extensive suit of colored drawings of medical plants, on an enlarged scale. Text-BookâDunglison's Therapeutics and Materia Medica. IX.âDEPARTMENT OF PRACTICAL ANATOMY. DR. B. W. ALLENâDEMONSTRATOR. This department is abundantly provided with fresh subjects for the use of the members of the class; the afternoon is devoted to the dissections; and they are conducted under the constant guidance of the demonstrator. X.âMORAL PHILOSOPHY. PROFESSOR M'GUFFEY. There are three classes in this school: The Junior class studies Rhetoric, Belles Letters and Philosophical Criticism. Text-BooksâBlair's Lectures, Campbell's Philosophy of Rhetoric, Whately's Rhetoric, Kame's Elements of Criticism, Cousin's Philosophy of the Beautiful, Milton and Shakespeare. 4 The Intermediate class studies Political Economy, Statistics, and the Philosophy of Social Relations, or "Ethics of Society." Text-BooksâOn Political Economy, Say and J. S. Mill; on the Progress of Society, Guizot, GrimkÃ© and De Tocqueville. The Senior class studies Mental Philosophy, Logic, (inductive and deductive,) together with Theoretical and Practical Ethics. Text-BooksâOn Mental Philosophy, Locke, Reid and Cousin; on Logic, Mill and Whately; on Ethics, Stewart, Butler and Jouffroy. The lectures are carried on concurrently during the session, two a week to each class. The examinations are on the Professor's lectures and the text-books above enumerated. XI.âSCHOOL OF LAW. PROFESSOR JOHN B. MINOR. ADJUNCT PROFESSOR, JAMES B. HOLCOMBE. The Board of Visitors, anxious to enlarge the sphere of legal instruction in the University, have appointed an Adjunct Professor of Law, to whom is assigned the duty of teaching more extensively than has hitherto been practicable, the subjects of Equity and of Commercial Law. The object will be to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. With this view, instruction (which is designed to be as thorough as possible) will be given as heretofore, partly through text-books, and daily examinations upon the subjects taught, partly by comments intended to supply what is deficient, and explain what is obscure in the text, and partly also by independent lectures. A Moot-court is instituted in connection with the school, upon a plan which experience has shewn to be well calculated to perfect the student in the details of practice. Under the immediate superintendence of the professors he is required to pronounce opinions upon supposed cases; to devise and to institute remedies, by suit or otherwise; to conduct suits at law and in chancery, from their inception, through all their stages; to draw wills, conveyances and other assurances; and, in short, to perform most of the functions of a practising lawyer. The school is divided into three classes, viz: the Junior class, embracing such studies as are at once essential to the professional student, and form a highly useful branch of general education; the Intermediate class, which is occupied exclusively with the theory and practice of law, as a profession, being adapted to the occasions of those who have not time or inclination to push their elementary attainments beyond the most absolute necessity; and the Senior class, in which efforts are made to impart a professional cultivation as liberal as the growing wants of the country shall demand or allow. The degree of Bachelor of Laws is conferred upon those who, upon examination, manifest a familiar acquaintance with the subjects taught in all the classes; and to those who exhibit a competent knowledge of International and Constitutional Law and of the science of Government, a certificate of proficiency is awarded. The course of study in the several classes is as follows: Junior ClassâVattel's International Law, Lectures on Government, Federalist, Madison's Report 1799, Blackstone's Commentaries. Intermediate ClassâStephen on Pleading, Barton's Suit in Equity, Lomax's Digest, Smith's Mercantile Law, Greenleaf's Evidence, Holcombe's Equity. Senior ClassâStory's Equity, Chitty on Contracts, Lomax on Executors, &amp;c. , Byles on Bills and Notes. The student is recommended to be provided with the following books for reference, viz: Gordon's Digest of Laws of United States, and Virginia Code of 1849. All the books required can be procured at the book stores near the University, on reasonable terms. EXAMINATIONS. These are of three kinds: first, the daily examinations, which precede the lectures; second, the public examinations, two in number, held the one about the middle of the session, the other at its close; and third, the examinations for graduation, held towards the end of the session. I.âDAILY EXAMINATIONS. In the daily examinations the student is questioned both upon the subject of the preceding lecture and such portions of the textbook as may have been designated by the professor. His preparation thus tested is noted at the time of examination, and if the student shall exhibit material delinquency, the fact is communicated to his parent or guardian in the printed circular which is sent home at the close of every month. II.âPUBLIC EXAMINATIONS. The two public examinations, embracing respectively all the subjects treated of in the first half, and all those treated of in the second half of the session, are thus conducted: The Professor of the school prepares in writing a series of questions to be proposed to the class, and affixes to them numerical values, according to his estimate of their relative difficulty. On the assembling of the class for examination, these questions are for the first time presented to them; and they are required to answer in writing in a prescribed time, without communication with one another or with other persons, and without any reference to books. Their answers are subsequently carefully examined and compared, and a value attached to each, not exceeding that of the corresponding question. In the schools of languages subjects are also selected for oral examination, and the values of these exercises marked at the time. The students are then arranged into four divisions, according to the merit of their examination, as determined by the following method: The numerical values attached to all the questions are added together, and also the values of the answers given by each student. If this last number amounts to three-fourths of the first, the student is ranked in the first division; if it be less than three-fourths, and as much as one-half, in the second; if less than one-half, and as much as a fourth, in the third; if less than a fourth, in the fourth division. The examinations are conducted and the results ascertained by a committee, consisting of the professor of the school and two other professors. The standing of the student at these examinations is communicated to his parent or guardian in the last circular of the session. Those who attain the first division receive in public, at the close of the session, a printed certificate of their distinction at one or both of the examinations, as the case may be, and their names are mentioned in the published account of the proceedings which terminate the course. These public examinations, though less thorough than the examinations for graduation, are sufficiently comprehensive and difficult to render it impossible for the student, without steady diligence, to secure a place in the first division. III.âEXAMINATIONS FOR GRADUATION. These are partly oral and partly in writing, and are conducted by the professor of the school, in the presence of two other professors, forming with him the committee of examination for the school. Here the student is subjected to searching interrogations upon the details and niceties, as well as the leading principles of the subject, and he is expected to be accurately versed in all the topics treated of in the lectures and the correlative texts. As a due acquaintance with our own language is made indispensable to the attainment of even the inferior honors of the University, all candidates for degrees are subjected to an examination, in order to test their qualifications in this respect. DEGREES. I.âTHE ACADEMICAL DEGREES. Are, first, that of Proficient in certain special departments of a school; second, that of Graduate in a school; third, that of Bachelor of Arts; and fourth, that of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia. The degree of Proficient, conferred in a certificate of proficiency, applies only to those branches of some of the schools which by the regulations the student is allowed to attend separately. These are Geology and Mineralogy, Medical Jurisprudence, Physiology, Political Economy, National Law, Constitutional Law and Government, and Anglo-Saxon. The degree of Graduate in a school embraces, in the school of Ancient Languages, the Latin and Greek Languages; in that of Modern Languages, any two of the languages taught in the school, except Anglo-Saxon; in that of Mathematics, all the studies of the school, except the Mixed Mathematics; in that of Natural Philosophy the same, omitting Geology and Mineralogy; in that of Moral Philosophy the same, omitting Political Economy. The degree of Graduate is also conferred in each of the languages separately, and in the Mixed Mathematics. None are admitted to these degrees who fail to give satisfactory evidence of their attainments at the public examinations and the examinations for graduation. II.âTHE DEGREE OF BACHELOR OF ARTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. This degree is conferred upon such students as have become graduates in any two of the scientific schools, viz: Mathematics, Natural Philosophy or Chemistry, and in two of the literary schools, viz: Ancient Languages, Modern Languages or Moral Philosophy, having also obtained distinction at an intermediate and final examination of the Junior class of the two remaining academic schools. The candidates for this degree have moreover to satisfy the Faculty of their general literary acquirements by furnishing an appropriate essay, composed by themselves, on some subject of literature and science, which they may be required to read on the Public Day. III.âTHE DEGREE OF MASTER OF ARTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. To merit this, the highest academical honor of the Institution, the student must have already become a graduate in the following schools: ANCIENT LANGUAGES, MODERN LANGUAGES, MATHEMATICS, NATURAL PHILOSOPHY, CHEMISTRY, MORAL PHILOSOPHY. He must, moreover, give proof of an accurate and comprehensive acquaintance with his entire course of studies, by an examination on all these subjects, in the presence of the whole Faculty, at the close of his academical career. And lastly, he must prepare and submit to the Faculty an essay or an oration, exhibiting a due degree of literary ability; and this, if so directed, he is required to read or deliver on the Public Day. IV.âTHE PROFESSIONAL DEGREES Are that of Doctor of Medicine, conferred on graduates in the Medical Department, and that of Bachelor of Laws, on graduates in the School of Law. To merit the degree of Doctor of Medicine, the student must prove by his examinations that he has made satisfactory attainments in Anatomy, Surgery, Human and Comparative Physiology, Principles and Practice of Medicine, Obstetrics, Materia Medica, Chemistry and Medical Jurisprudence. To attain the degree of Bachelor of Laws, he must in the same manner give evidence of a due acquaintance with the Law of Nature and Nations, the Science of Government, Constitutional Law, Municipal Law, including the Common Statute Law, the principles of Equity and Commercial Law. Honorary degrees are forbidden by the laws of the University. THE PUBLIC DAY. On the closing day of the session, which, unless that day be Sunday, occurs on the 29th of June, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers and Students, and the Society of Alumni, assemble in the Public Hall, whither are also invited the friends of the students and the public generally. On this occasion the certificates and diplomas are awarded to the successful candidates, the results of the examinations are announced, and addresses are delivered by one or more of the Bachelors and Masters of Arts. EXPENSES. The expenses for the session of nine months are as follows: 1. Fees.âIf one professor be attended, $50; if two, each $30; if more than two, each $25. In the school of Law, the fee for the Intermediate class is $60, and for the Senior class $75. Every student is required to attend three schools, unless, for special reasons, leave is given to attend but one or two. Medical students are charged $100 for a full course, viz: $25 for each of four tickets, and are required to pay a fee of $5 for dissecting material. For the class of Anglo-Saxon in the school of Modern Languages, of Geology and Mineralogy in the school of Natural Philosophy, of Physiology in the school of Anatomy, of Medical Jurisprudence in the school of Medicine, or of National Law, Government and Constitutional Law, in the school of Law, the fee is $15 only. 2. Board and Lodgings.âBoard in any of the University hotels or boarding houses, licensed by the Faculty, $120; for which sum, diet, bedding, room-furniture and attendance are furnished. Washing may be had for $8 or $10 for the session. Rent of an entire dormitory $16; if occupied by two students $8. Only nine dormitories can, by regulation, be occupied by a single student. Fuel and candles are furnished by the Proctor at cost and five per cent. commission, and cost for each of two students, in the same dormitory, about $20. 3. Matriculation fee, and use of Library and public rooms, $15. The expenses of the students resident in the University are limited as follows: 1. For board, the use of the dormitory, matriculation and tuition fees, the sums before stated. 2. For clothing during the session, an amount not exceeding one hundred dollars. 3. For pocket-money during the session, a sum not exceeding forty-five dollars. 4. For books and stationery, whatever the parent or guardian may think fit to allow. 5. For medicine and medical attendance whatever may be necessary. These are in no case to be exceeded, unless under special circumstances the Faculty shall allow it. PROHIBITION OF CREDIT. The act of the legislature prohibiting merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students, is strictly enforced The license to contract debts, which the Chairman is authorized to grant, is confined (except where the parent or guardian otherwise, in writing, requests,) to cases of urgent necessity; and these it is hoped the parents and guardians will, as far as possible, prevent from arising, by the timely supply of the requisite funds. HOTELS OR BOARDING-HOUSES. Hotels or boarding-houses are provided in the precincts of the University for the accommodation of students, and no student is permitted to board or lodge out of the precincts, unless in the family of his parent or guardian, or of some particular friend, approved by the Faculty. Except that students above the age of twenty-one years may reside out of the precincts, in such private boarding-houses as the Faculty may approve. The charges at the private boarding-houses, being those licensed by the Faculty, are required by the regulations not to exceed those of the hotels within the precincts. The hotel keepers are bound to maintain good order among their boarders during meals, and to report all cases of misconduct of which they have knowledge, whether occurring in their own houses or elsewhere. KEEPING OF STUDENTS' FUNDS. Every student resident within the precincts is required, on matriculating, to deposit with the Patron all the money, checks, bills, drafts, and other available funds, which he shall have in his possession or under his control, in any manner intended to defray his expenses while at the University, or on his return from thence to his residence. Nor shall he matriculate till he shall have deposited a sum at least sufficient to pay for the use of his dormitory and the public rooms, to pay the fees of the Professors whom he may design to attend, to pay three months' board to his hotel-keeper, to purchase the text-books and stationery which he may want at the commencement, twenty dollars on account of fuel and candles, and ten dollars to cover contingent charges and assessments against him for injuries to the buildings, &amp;c. , which two last mentioned sums are credited in the final settlement of his accounts. In like manner, he shall deposit with the Patron all the funds which he shall receive while a student of the University for the purpose aforesaid. At the end of the first three months of the session, he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the next three months; and at the expiration of the second period of three months, he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the residue of the session. Students resident out of the University are required, on matriculating, to deposit with the Patron funds sufficient to pay the fees of Professors whom they may propose to attend, the sum charged for the use of the public rooms, and ten dollars to cover contingent charges. PRIVILEGED STUDENTS. Ministers of the gospel and young men preparing for the ministry, bringing proper certificates from their congregations as to character and standing, may attend any of the schools of the University without payment of fees to the Professors. The Faculty, at their discretion, may allow any man of undoubted moral character, above the age of twenty-three years, to attend lectures in any of the schools of the University, and to reside out of the precincts, exempt from the rules and regulations prescribed for the government of students; except only that he shall pay the usual Professors' fees, and the usual compensation for the use of the public rooms, and shall observe all those laws of the Institution which enjoin respectful and orderly deportment. But the privilege so allowed may be withdrawn by the Faculty at any time, when in their opinion it has been used to the evil example of the students, or otherwise to the injury of the Institution. MONTHLY CIRCULAR. At the end of every month, a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from lectures and examinations, and any other irregularity of which he may have been guilty; together with such further information as to the student's progress and conduct, as it may be deemed proper to communicate. The object of such report being on the one hand to incite the student to steady diligence, by eliciting the commendation and encouragement of his friends, and on the other to restrain him from idleness and disorder, or to urge him to amendment by their admonition and advice, the usefulness of these circulars greatly depends upon the prompt and judicious attention they receive from those to whom they are addressed. Parents and guardians therefore cannot be too earnest in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly reports may suggest. LIBRARY. The Library of the University, originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, has since been augmented by several valuable donations, among which the legacy of Mr. Madison, amounting to 587 volumes, that of the late Christian Bohn, Esq., a generous and enlightened citizen of Richmond, amounting to 3,380 vols., and a donation of 234 works presented by an unknown benevolent lady through the Rev. Dr. Alexander, of Princeton. Through 5 such additions, and the annual increease by purchase, the library now numbers upwards of 18,000 volumes, comprising an unusually large proportion of standard literary and scientific works in the principal European languages, together with a rich and extensive collection of engravings. Students are allowed the use of the books, under the usual restrictions, and the Librarian is in attendance daily at stated hours to comply with their orders and to receive the books returned. SOCIETY OF ALUMNI. This association is composed of such former students of the University as, having finally left the Institution, have on nomination been elected members, at the annual meetings. Its objects are the promotion of letters and general education, as well as the renewal from year to year of the pleasing associations of academic life. The society holds its meetings at the close of the session. An orator or an essayist is annually appointed by the society from among its members, and the oration or essay is delivered in the Rotunda on the day preceding the Public Day. LITERARY SOCIETIES. There are two literary societies formed by the students of the University, which meet weekly at their own or public rooms for the purpose of cultivating debate and composition, and hold occasionally public exhibitions. RELIGIOUS EXERCISES. Divine service is performed in the chapel every Sunday morning and evening during the session, by the Chaplain of the University, who is appointed in turn from the principal religious denominations. Students also have the opportunity of attending, at their choice, daily morning service in the chapel; and on Sundays, service at any of the churches in Charlottesville. STATE STUDENTS. To render education at the University available to meritorious young men of limited means, provision has been made for the admission of 32 students, without payment of Professor's fees, board or University charges. The advantage is meant to be restricted to those who are not themselves, and whose parents are not in a situation to incur the expenses of education. Their connection with the University is to continue two years, but for extraordinary proficiency the Board of Visitors may prolong the term. They stand, in all respeets, except expense, on the same footing as other students, enjoying the same privileges, and subject to the same laws. By way of remuneration to the State for the assistance thus afforded, they are expected to teach in some public or private school within the limits of Virginia, for two years after leaving the University. The selection of students, on this foundation, is made by the Faculty on the first day of July, annually. Application for vacancies, accompanied by proper testimonials, addressed to the Chairman of the Faculty, should reach the University by the 25th of June. ? Persons interested will be pleased to observe the following particulars: 1. The applicant is requested to state his age, which must be over seventeen years, and to designate the several schools of the University he may wish to enter, observing that the enactments require him, if under the age of twenty-one years, to attend at least three, unless, for good cause, the Faculty permit him to attend a less number. 2. In order to be admitted, the applicant must exhibit satisfactory testimonialsâ1st. Of irreproachable moral character; 2nd. Of capacity, as well by partial cultivation, as original vigor of mind, to profit by the instruction given at the University; 3rd. If he desires to enter the schools of Mathematics, or of Natural Philosophy, that he possesses a familiar acquaintance with all the branches of numerial Arithmetic, or if he desires to enter the school of Ancient Languages, that he is qualified to commence the study of the higher Latin or Greek authors; and 4th. That neither he, nor his parents, are in a situation to incur the expense of his education without aid.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">APPENDIX. An extract from a report of Mr. Jefferson to the Directors of the Literary Fund, of the 7th October, 1822. In the same report of the commissioners, of 1818, it was stated by them that "in eonformity with the principles of our constitution, which place all sects of religion on an equal footing, with the jealousies of the different sects in guarding that equality from encroachment or surprise, and with the sentiments of the legislature in favor of freedom of religion, manifested on former occasions, they had not proposed that any professorship of Divinity should be established in the University; that provision, however, was made for giving instruction in the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin languages, the depositories of the original, and of the earliest and most respected authorities of the faith of every sect, and for courses of ethical lectures developing those moral obligations in which all sects agree. That proceeding thus far without offence to the constitution, they had left at this point to every sect to take into their own hands the office of further instruction in the peculiar tenets of each. It was not, however, to be understood that instruction in religious opinions and duties was meant to be precluded by the public authorities as indifferent to the interests of society. On the contrary, the relations which exist between man and his Maker, and the duties resulting from those relations are the most interesting and important to every human being, and the most incumbent on his study and investigation. The want of instruction in the various creeds of religious faith existing among our citizens, presents therefore a chasm in a general institution of the useful sciences. But it was thought this want and the entrustment to each society of instruction in its own doctrines, were evils of less danger than a permission to the public authorities to dictate modes or principles of religious instruction, or than opportunities furnished them of giving countenance or ascendency to any one sect over another. A remedy, however, has been suggested of promising aspect, which, while it excludes the public authorities from the domain of religious freedom, would give to the sectarian schools of divinity the full benefit of the public provisions made for instruction in the other branches of science. These branches are equally necessary to the divine as to the other professional or civil characters, to enable them to fulfil the duties of their calling with understanding and usefulness. It has therefore been in contemplation and suggested by some pious individuals, who perceive the advantages of associating other studies with those of religion, to establish these religious schools on the confines of the University, so as to give to their students ready and convenient access and attendance on the scientific lectures of the University. Such establishments would offer the further and great advantage of enabling the students of the University to attend religious exercises with the professor of their particular sect, either in the rooms of the building still to be erected, and destined to that purpose under impartial regulations, as proposed in the same report of the commissioners, or in the lecturing room of such professor. To such propositions the Visitors are disposed to lend a willing ear, and would think it their duty to give every encouragement by assuring to those who might choose such a location for their school, that the regulations of the University should be so modified and accommodated as to give every facility of access and attendance to their students, with such regulated use also as may be permitted to the other students of the library, which may hereafter be acquired by public or private munificence, but always understanding that these schools shall be independent of the University and of each other. Such an arrangement would complete the circle of the useful sciences embraced by the Institution, and would fill the chasm now existing on principles which would leave inviolate the constitutional freedom of religion, the most inalienable and sacred of all human rights, over which the people and authorities of this State, individually and publicly, have ever manifested the most watchful jealousy; and could this jealousy be now alarmed in the opinion of the legislature by what is here suggested, the idea will be relinquished on any surmise of disapprobation which they may think proper to express. On the 4th October, 1824, the Board of Visitors agreed to the following resolutions: Should the religious sects of this State, or any of them, according to the invitation held out to them, establish within or adjacent to the University, schools for instruction in the religion of their sect, the students of the University will be free and expected to attend religious worship at the establishment of their respective sects in the morning, and in time to meet their school in the University at its stated hour. The students of such religious school, if they attend any school of the University, shall be considered students of the University, subject to the same regulations, and entitled to the same rights and privileges.</field>
