      <field name="fulltext">THE TERMS OF ADMISSION, Courses of Instruction, Expenses, &amp;c., AT THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. MATRICULATION. To be admitted as a student of the University, the applicant must be at least sixteen years of age; but the Faculty may dispense with this requirement in favor of one who has a brother of the requisite age entering at the same time. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he must produce a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence of general good conduct. In this institution there is no curriculum or prescribed course of study, to be pursued by every student, whatever his previous preparation or special objects. In establishing the University of Virginia, Mr. Jefferson, for the first time in America, threw open the doors of a University in the true sense of the name, providing, as amply as the available means would permit, for thorough instruction in independent schools in all the chief branches of learning, assuming that the opportunities for study thus presented were privileges to be voluntarily and eagerly sought, and allowing students to select for themselves the departments to which they were led by their special tastes and proposed pursuits in life to devote themselves. The wisdom of this plan has been amply vindicated by time and experience, and within the last few years many of the institutions of higher culture in the United States have to a greater or less extent remodelled their method of study in accordance with the example here set. This elective system commends itself especially to those who desire to make professional attainments in any department of knowledge. At the same time the courses of academic study are so arranged as to provide for the systematic prosecution of a complete plan of general education. While every student may thus select the schools he will attend, in the academic department he is required as a rule to attend at least three, unless upon the written request of his parent or guardian, or for good cause shown, the Faculty shall allow him to attend less than three. Students are permitted to exchange schools, with transfer of fees, within one week after admission; thereafter no exchange is allowed, except by leave of the Faculty, and then without transfer of fees. The session commences on the first of October, and continues, without interruption, until the Thursday before the fourth day of July The mode of instruction is by lectures and text-books accompanied by daily examinations.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Literary and Scientific Department. SCHOOL OF LATIN. Prof. Peters. The subjects taught in this school are the Latin Language and Literature, with the History of Rome. The School is divided into three classes: Junior, Intermediate, and Senior. Text Books—Junior Class—Cæsar, Ovid, Sallust. Intermediate Class—Cicero, Virgil, Terence, Livy. Senior Class—Cicero, Horace, Livy, Juvenal, Taeitus. Grammar.—Zumpt's, Gildersleeve's, Harrison's Exposition of the Laws of the Latin Language. Lexicons.—Andrew's, or Freund's Leverett. History.—Browne's Roman Literature, Liddell's Rome, Long's Atlas. Instruction is given by lectures and by examinations upon the portions of text assigned for recitation. The exercises of rendering Latin into English, and English into Latin, in writing, constitute a prominent feature in the course. In addition to the portions of the several authors read in the lecture room, a course of extra and parallel reading is required in each class. Sanskrit. The Professor of Latin will also give instruction in Sanskrit. Text-Books.—Monier Williams' Grammar, Benfey's Lexicon, selections from the Mahâ-Bhârata. SCHOOL OF GREEK. Prof. Gildersleeve. The School is divided into three classes: Junior, Intermediate, and Senior. The method of instruction comprises lectures (systematic and exegetical,) examinations, written and oral exercises. Junior Class.—The Junior Class is intended especially for those who desire to make a thorough review of the inflections and to acquire a practical familiarity with the great principles of the language. The only author read in this class is Xenophon. Grammar.—Kühner's Elementary. Intermediate Class.—Lysias, Xenophon, Herodotus, Homer, and Demosthenes. Senior Class.—Thucydides, Sophocles, Euripides, and Plato. Grammars.—Hadley's, Kühner's, Goodwin's Moods and Tenses. Liddell and Scott's Lexicon, Smith's History of Greece. A private course of parallel and preparatory reading is also prescribed for each class. The weekly exercises constitute a prominent feature in the plan of instruction. Post Graduate Department.—The Post Graduate Department has been instituted for the benefit of graduates and others who wish to pursue a more extended course of reading. The authors read in this department are such as are either by their form or subjects less suited for the regular school, e. g. Æschylus, Aristophanes, and Aristotle. In the examinations of candidates for graduation in Latin and Greek, the passages given for the written translations are selected, not from the portions of authors which have been read and explained in the lecture room, but from the classic writers at will. Hebrew. The Professor of Greek will also give instruction in Hebrew whenever the demand for such instruction is sufficient to make the institution of a course of lectures expedient. Grammar. — Deutsch's. SCHOOL OF MODERN LANGUAGES. Prof. Schele de Vere. The subjects taught in this School are: 1. The French, German, Italian, and Spanish languages. 2.

SCHOOL OF HISTORY, GENERAL LITERATURE AND RHETORIC. Prof. Holmes. This School is divided into two distinct classes — one of History and one of Literature and Rhetoric. To each, two Lectures in the week are regularly devoted; but exercises in literary composition are required from the members of the Literary Class. Each study may be pursued separately. Class of History. In the Historical Class the successions, revolutions, and various aspects of the principal nations of the world are considered in such a manner as to afford a general and connected view of the progress of political and social organizations. Institutions and laws are noted as the manifestations of different phases of society; an attempt is made to discover and elucidate the conditions of historical advancement, and to refer the changes of nations and governments to the operation of regular principles. Text Books—Schmitz's Manual of Ancient History; Smith's History of Greece; Gibbon, Abridged by Smith; Taylor's Manual of Modern History. For reference—Long's Ancient Atlas; Appleton's (College) Atlas, or Chambers' Atlas; Blair's Chronology (Bohn's edition.) Class of Literature and Rhetoric. In the Class of Literature and Rhetoric, the English Language, English Composition, Rhetoric, and the English Classics, with the History of English Literature, are studied. The origin, growth and philological peculiarities of the Language are considered; the various influences, domestic and external, by which it has been brought to its present condition are explained; the general principles of Rhetoric and Criticism are taught; the lives of the most eminent authors in the language are treated in their historical order and connection; and the critical examination and appreciation of their chief productions occupy much of the time of the student. The class will also be required to practise Literary Composition. Text Books — Keane's Handbook of the History of the English Language; Jamieson's Grammar of Rhetoric; Shaw's Complete Manual of English Literature, Ed. Smith and Tuckerman; Student's Specimens of English Literature, Ed. Shaw and Smith, London. Shakespeare's Complete Works; Milton's Poetical Works. For instruction in Oratory or spoken composition, those portions of Dr. Broadus's Treatise on the Preparation and Delivery of Sermons, which are appropriate to secular purposes, are specially commended. The study of Angus's Handbook of the English Language is also recommended. Political Economy. In the Class of Political Economy, lately connected with this School, the Text-Books used are Say's Political Economy, and Mill's (J.S.) Political Economy. Two lectures a week are given. SCHOOL OF MATHEMATICS. Prof. Venable. This School embraces two distinct departments or courses: 1. Pure Mathematics. 2. Mixed Mathematics. Pure Mathematics. In the course of Pure Mathematics there are three classes, Junior, Intermediate, and Senior. Junior Class.— Theory of Arithmetical Operations and Notation, Algebra, Geometry and Geometrical Conic Sections, with discussions of the Ancient Geometrical Analysis, the Theory of Transversals, and other subjects of Modern Geometry. The preparation desirable for this class is the thorough study of Arithmetic, of Algebra through Equations of the Second Degree, and of the first four books of Legendre or Euclid. Intermediate Class.— Plane and Spherical Trigonometry with Applications, Analytical Geometry of two Dimensions, the Theory of Equations, and Elements of Descriptive Geometry. Senior Class.— Analytical Geometry of three Dimensions, the Differential and Integral Calculus with applications to the Theory of Probabilities, and the Determination of Mean Values and Centres of Gravity, and the Calculus of Variations. Lectures are given to this class on the History of Mathematics, and on some points in Controversial Mathematics, with brief discussions of the elements of Tri-linear Coördinates, of the Theory of Determinants, the Theory of Complex Functions, and of the principles of the Method of Quaternions. Text Books.—Junior Class—Venable's Higher Arithmetic, Todhunter's Algebra, Legendre's Geometry. For reference and examples, Pott's Euclid. Intermediate Class.—Snowball's Trigonometry, Law's Logarithms, Puckle's Conic Sections (Analytical Geometry), Church's Descriptive Geometry. For reference, Todhunter's Theory of Equations. Senior Class.—Aldis' Solid Geometry, Courtenay's Calculus, Todhunter's Differential and Integral Calculus. In the Junior Class there are three lectures each week; in the Intermediate Class, two lectures each week; in the Senior Class, three lectures each week. Mixed Mathematics. This course is designed for those students who may desire to prosecute their studies beyond the limits of the Pure Mathematics. It embraces Applications of the Differential and Integral Calculus to selected portions of Mechanics, Physics, and Physical Astronomy. There is one class in the Mixed Mathematics. In the Class of Mixed Mathematics there are two lectures each week. The instruction in each class in the School of Mathematics is conveyed partly by lectures and partly by the systematic study of approved text-books, the student being assisted by full and frequent explanations from the Professor, and being constantly subjected to rigid examinations. The progress of the student in each class is also tested by his being required to perform written exercises, in which the principles acquired are applied to the solution of particular problems. Any student entering the school has the privilege of attending all or any of the classes, and if prepared to enter an advanced class, may often find it highly advantageous to review his previous studies by attendance on a lower class also. SCHOOL OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Prof. Smith. There are two classes in this School. Junior Class.— The Junior or General Class meets three times each week throughout the session of nine months. The object of the course of lectures to this class is to furnish the student with a comprehensive view of Modern Physics, and to make him familiar with its methods of investigation. With the design of laying a thoroughly scientific basis for the course, a large space is given at the outset to the discussion of the cardinal doctrines of motion and force. These doctrines are established, and their leading consequences are traced, without the use of mathematical symbols. Guided by these truths, the teacher discusses, in the light of experiment, the structure of matter according to the received atomic hypotheses, and the equilibrium and motion of solids and fluids. These topics, with various applications, occupy the first half of the course of lectures. The remainder of the course is devoted to Molecular Physics, and treats of Capillarity, Osmose, Wave Motion, Sound, Light, Heat and Electricity. In this, as in the previous portion of the lectures, the established laws of motion and force are kept steadily in view, and an attempt is made so to present and discuss the phenomena as to convince the student that the entire body of Physics is doubtless a coherent and harmonious system of mechanical truth. Text Books.— The Professor's written Syllabus; Maxwell on Heat. Senior Class.— This class meets twice a week, and studies Mechanics and Astronomy. Text Books,— Parkinson's Mechanics, in conjunction with the Professor's written lectures, Norton's Astronomy, Chauvenet's Spherical Astronomy, Vol. I. Mineralogy and Geology. These subjects are assigned to a separate class, which the members of the other classes in the School may attend without payment of an additional fee. In this class the lectures commence with General Mineralogy. This is treated with especial reference to Geology, to which it is designed to be an introduction. In the lectures on Geology, the specific identity of ancient and modern Geological causes is pointed out; the present action of these causes, whether atmospheric, aqueous, or igneous, is considered, and their effects in the past history of the Earth are examined. The illustrations are drawn, as far as practicable, from the Geological structure of Virginia. The students have an opportunity of familiarising themselves with the minerals, rocks and fossils exhibited in the lectures. Text Books.— Dana's Manuals of Mineralogy and Geology. SCHOOL OF GENERAL AND APPLIED CHEMISTRY. Prof. Mallet. In this School there are two classes: I. The class in general Chemistry hears three lectures each week throughout the session. The fundamental ideas of chemical science, the relations of Chemistry to Physics, the laws regulating chemical combination by weight and by volume, the atomic theory as at present viewed in connection with Chemistry, the chemical nomenclature and symbols now in use, and a general survey of the descriptive chemistry of the elements and their compounds inorganic and organic, are brought forward in order, with incidental allusion to the applications in medicine, the arts and manufactures, of the facts mentioned. The attention of medical students is particularly drawn to the Physiological, Medical and Sanitary relations of the subject — the chemical nature and properties of poisons, methods of detecting them and of counteracting their effects, &amp;c. Text Book — Fownes' Chemistry, last edition. Recommended for reference: Miller's Elements of Chemistry; A. Naquet — Principles de Chimie fondée sur les théories modernes. Lectures on Pharmacy are given to the students of medicine, this special course beginning soon after the intermediate examinations. Text Book — Parrish's Pharmacy. II. The class in Industrial Chemistry, to which class also three lectures a week are delivered, studies in detail the chemical principles and processes specially concerned in the more important arts and manufactures, upon which in large measure depends the development of the natural resources of the country; the opportunity being thus presented of preparation for such positions as those of the miner and metallurgist, the chemical manufacturer, the dyer, bleacher, tanner, sugar refiner, &amp;c. Amongst the more prominent subjects discussed are: The production of materials of very general application, including the metallurgy of iron, copper, lead, zinc, tin, silver, gold, &amp;c.; the preparation and properties of alloys, and the processes of electro-metallurgy, the manufacture upon the large scale of acids, alkalies, salts, glass, porcelain and earthenware; the production and preservation of food including the processes of bread-making, wine-making, brewing and distilling, the manufacture of sugar and vinegar, the curing of meat, the examination and purification of drinking water, &amp;c.; chemical arts relating to clothing, such as bleaching, dyeing, calico printing, tanning, and the preparation of Indian rubber; the chemistry of those arts which afford us shelter, embracing the examination of building materials, lime-burning, the manufacture of mortar and cements, the explosive agents used in blasting, as gunpowder, gun cotton, nitroglycerine, paints and varnishes, disinfecting materials, &amp;c.; heating and ventilation, the different kinds of fuel and modes of burning them; illumination by artificial means, candles, lamps, the preparation of petroleum, the manufacture of illuminating gas, matches; the chemistry of washing, the preparation of soap, starch and perfumes; the chemical relations of printing and writing, the manufacture of paper, ink, artists' colors, photographic materials, &amp;c. Text Book — Wagner's Chemical Technology, translated by Crookes. For reference — Richardson and Watts' Chemical Technology, Muspratt's Chemistry as Applied to Arts and Manufactures; Ure's Dictionary of Arts and Manufactures; Dumas — Traité de Chimie appliquée aux Arts; Percy's Metallurgy, &amp;c. The lectures to both these classes are illustrated by suitable experiments, and by such specimens, models, drawings, &amp;c., as the various subjects require. The collections of the University in illustration of the processes and products of industrial chemistry have been procured with much expense and pains in this country, England, France, and Germany, and are unusually extensive and good — amongst the best, if not the best, on this side of the Atlantic. SCHOOL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS, ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE. Prof. Bœck. The School is divided into three classes: Junior Class.— Theory and use of Engineering Instruments* * The subjects marked by the asterisk are those required for the students of Mining Engineering in this School. , Land Surveying* and Levelling* , Construction of Roads, Railroads, Canals and Tunnels, Spherical Astronomy and Geodesy, Drainage and Irrigation, General Theory of Building, including Building Materials* , Framing* , and Masonry* , General Theory of Projections* , Orthogonal and Oblique Projections, including Orthogonal and Oblique Projections of Shades and Shadows* , Topographical Drawing* , Constructive and Free-hand Drawing* , Drawing of Ornaments, &amp;c., Field Practice* .

SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL AND AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. Prof. Mallet. Adjunct Prof. Dunnington. In Analytical Chemistry there are three classes: I. The first class meets twice each week during the session, on each occasion spending from two to four hours in practical experiment in the laboratory. A regularly arranged course of practice in chemical manipulation is first pursued; qualitative analysis is then taken up, and the means of detecting the most important chemical substances having been learned, students are required to find out for themselves, by analysis, the constituents of unknown materials presented to them. Special attention is given to substances having useful applications in the arts or connected with agriculture. Towards the close of the session the elements of quantitative analysis are taught, so far as the limitation of time will permit. II. The laboratory will be open to the second class on five days of each week during the whole of the working hours of each day. A full course of instruction in practical chemistry, including the qualitative and quantitative analysis of ores, soils, manures, technical products, &amp;c., will be given; and students will be assisted and encouraged to undertake original research. III. The third class is one specially intended for students of medicine, and will meet for lessons of two hours each, once in the week for four months of the session. To this class the practical applications of chemistry to medicine will be taught, the detection of poisons, chemical and microscopical examination of animal products, urine, blood, &amp;c. Among the works recommended to laboratory students are: Fresenius — Quantative and Quantitative Analysis; H. Rose — Handbuch der analytischen Chemie (also in French translation); Geville Williams — Handbook of Chemical Manipulation; Wöhler— Examples for Practice in Chemical Analysis; Bolley — Handbuch der technisch-chemischen Untersuchungen; Oding — Practical Chemistry for Medical Students; A. H. Church — Laboratory Guide for Agricultural Students. In Agricultural Chemistry there is one class, to which lectures are delivered once a week throughout the session; or, when found more convenient to students of agriculture, a larger number of lectures per week will be given during a part of the year only. In this course the chemical and physical properties of soils, of the atmosphere, and of plants, the chemistry of the processes of vegetable life and growth, the composition and chemical preparation of manures, &amp;c., will be discussed. Text Books — S. W. Johnson — How Crops Grow, and How Crops Feed. For reference, J. F. W. Johnston — Agricultural Chemistry, R. Homan — Theoretisch-praktische Ackerbauchemie. Farmers who are not regular students of the University, but may desire to attend this special course, are freely invited to do so. Very liberal provision has been made in the way of material arrangements for the teachings of this Chair. A new laboratory building of ample size, specially designed for the purposes of working students, has been erected containing all necessary rooms, fitted with double windows for the preservation of uniform temperature, and amply supplied with gas, water and all proper laboratory fixtures; and all needful apparatus, chemicals, minerals, materials for analysis, &amp;c., have been imported from Europe in abundance. THE SCHOOL OF NATURAL HISTORY, EXPERIMENTAL AND PRACTICAL AGRICULTURE. Prof. Jno. R. Page, M. D. This School will be divided into three (3) classes, viz: Zoology, Boany, and Agriculture. I. Zoology will include the leading principles of the science, with special reference to the Anatomy, Physiology, and Morphology of typical species throughout the animal kingdom. Special lectures will be given during this course in regard to Insects injurious to Vegetation; Fish and Oyster culture; and the breeding, rearing, and diseases of Domestic Animals. II. Botany will include a minute history of the structure, physiology and morphology of the plant, in embryo, root, stem, leaf, flower, fruit, and formation of seed. During this course, special lectures will be given on Noxious Weeds and useful plants, and some of the Fungoid diseases of Plants. III. Agriculture.— This course will be divided into two (2) parts, Experimental and Practical. 1. Experimental Agriculture will have reference to the food of Plants in the Atmosphere and Soil; the formation, variety, classification and adaptation of soils to various crops, illustrated by suitable experiments. 2. Practical Agriculture will relate to the Soil Cultivated, its nature, exposure and drainage; the importance of making domestic Manures and their application; the use of Fertilizers, with experiments, in order to show their effects. Tillage illustrated practically on the farm, in plowing, subsoiling, harrowing, rolling, &amp;c.; in preparing the land for the reception of Seed, as well as in the cultivation of Crops. Special instruction will be given in regard to the practical management of teams, in the various mechanical operations on the farm. The lectures in the three classes will be delivered concurrently throughout the session, as far as practicable. The following Text Books will be used in this School: Manual of Zoology, Nicholson; School and Field Book of Botany, Gray; How Crops Grow, Johnson; How Crops Feed, Johnson. The following may be usefully referred to in connection with different parts of the course: "Carpenter's Zoology;" Harris' "Insects Injurious to Vegetation;" Chapman's "Flora of the Southern States;" "How to Farm Profitably," Mechi; "Muck Manual," Dans; "American Weeds and Useful Plants," Darlington.</field>

J. W. MALLET, M. D., LL. D., Professor of Chemistry and Pharmacy. Text Books. — Fownes' Chemistry and Parrish's Pharmacy. WM. B. TOWLES, M. D. Demonstrator of Anatomy. The Medical Department is organised on the same general plan as the other departments of the University, the distinctive features of which are comprehensiveness and thoroughness of instruction, and the graduation of the student upon satisfactory evidences of attainments only, without regard to the length of time he may have been attending the lectures. An experience of more than forty years has fully attested the excellence of the plan. The scholarship of the alumni of the institution and the value of its degrees are now freely conceded by cultivated and liberal men throughout the country. The Medical Department of the University aims at thorough work in its special province, to wit: the instruction of the student in the principles of medicine, and his discipline in the modes of acquiring and applying knowledge. Thus, whilst the only solid foundation of professional attainments is laid, the mental faculties are expanded and strengthened for that growth in knowledge, usefulness and distinction to which every one who enlists in an honorable and responsible profession should aspire. The organization and arrangements by which these aims are successfully accomplished may be briefly stated: ARRANGEMENT OF STUDIES. The length of the session (nine months) renders it convenient and eligible to distribute the subjects of instruction among a smaller number of Professors than in the other medical schools of the United States whose sessions are only four or five months long. Thus to one Professor is assigned Comparative Anatomy, Physiology and Surgery; to another, Human Anatomy and Materia Medica; to a third, Chemistry and Pharmacy; and to a fourth, Medical Jurisprudence, Obstetrics, and the Practice of Medicine. This distribution renders it practicable to bring the different subjects to the attention of the student in their natural and successive order. The arrangement of the lectures is such that he acquires a competent knowledge of Anatomy, human and comparative, Physiology and Chemistry, before he enters upon the study of the principles and practice of Medicine and Surgery, which can only be studied properly in the lights shed upon them by the former. The instructions in Materia Medica and Pharmacy are also given in due relation to the progress of the student in Chemistry. COMPARATIVE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY. A feature in the course of medical instruction at this University worthy of note is the space given to Comparative Anatomy and Comparative Physiology. The structure and functions of the organs in the human system can, in fact, be fully understood only by comparisons running through the whole animal series. The comparison of extensively varied types of animal forms, all executing substantially the same fundamental phenomena of life, enables the inquirer to ascertain what are the essential constituents of each organ, and what the essential conditions of its action. By this process knowledge is made positive by experiments ready prepared by nature, which are much more trustworthy than any that may be specially contrived by man. PHARMACY. The introduction of Pharmacy into the course of instruction is another feature of interest, serving as it does to initiate the student into an art which he will find of value when he comes to the practice of his profession. LECTURES AND DAILY EXAMINATIONS. Favored as the student is in the comprehensiveness, scientific basis and order of his studies, he is not less favored by arrangements which give ample time for the preparation of every lecture, and address motives to him for such preparation. Each Professor gives three regular lectures a week, with occasional extra lectures, making the average weekly aggregate not over fourteen, or a little more than two a day. The student, therefore, is not over-burthened with lec-ture-room attendance. He has time for study in his private room, to consult books and compare their teachings with the oral instructions of his Professors, and to digest and systematise his acquisitions from both sources. The daily examinations which precede every lecture supply the stimulus to regular and active study, serve as summary reviews of what he has already heard or read, and as correctives of any misconceptions he may have fallen into in his hearing or reading. The daily examinations constitute a very valuable part of the exercises of the Institution, and are taken into account in determining the fitness of a student for graduation. APPARATUS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. The equipment of the Medical Department in apparatus, specimens and drawings is extensive and excellent. The collection of paintings for the illustration of the lectures on Anatomy, Physiology and Surgery, several hundred in number, is unequalled by anything of the kind in the United States, or perhaps abroad. A skilful artist was diligently engaged for six years in executing them under the direction and critical supervision of the Professors. They delineate the tissues, muscles, heart and blood vessels, brain, spinal marrow and nerves, the organs of sense, the thoracic, abdominal and pelvic viscera, and indeed all the structures and organs of the human body with admirable accuracy and distinctness, and are of great value as helps to lucid instruction in the branches to which they relate. In all the other branches, the appropriate means of illustration of every topic of discussion are likewise at hand, and are duly utilised. PRACTICAL ANATOMY AND DISSECTION. The Department furnishes every facility for the study of practical Anatomy that can be furnished in similar institutions elsewhere. Adequate provision is made for the supply of subjects, and each student has the opportunity, by actual dissections under the guidance of the Demonstrator of Anatomy, of acquiring a practical knowledge of the structure of the human body in all its parts. The University offers no facilities for clinical instruction. There are no public hospitals for the sick in the vicinity; nor, in the present connection, is this a source of regret. The aim of the Medical Department is to lay a thorough foundation for medical acquirements and to indoctrinate the student in the principles of the profession. When well versed in the principles of medicine, he is prepared to profit by clinical instruction, and not before. The value of clinical instruction is freely conceded; but it is an unprofitable use of time for the first-course student to give his attention to it. No class of medical students are more eager than those who have attended the full course of medical lectures at this institution, to seek instruction at the bedside of the sick, whether under the guidance of the private practitioner or under the more ample, varied and systematic teachings of clinical lecturers in public hospitals; and none, it may be safely said, are better qualified to profit by it. In proof may be adduced the fact that a large proportion, much larger than any influence save that of merit could secure, find their way to eligible and responsible positions on the house staffs of the great city hospitals after leaving this University. DEGREE. The degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred upon such students as prove their fitness for the same by rigid and searching examination. It has ever been the policy of the Institution to make its honors testimonials of merit, and not certificates of attendance on a prescribed course of instruction. In accordance with this policy, the degree of Doctor of Medicine may be conferred upon a first-course student if found worthy of it. Not only is it within reach of the intelligent, diligent and persevering to graduate in one session of nine months, but in point of fact many do thus graduate. A longer time, however, is often devoted to the necessary preparation, and wisely, when circumstances permit. It is not an unusual case that an academic student, looking forward to medicine as his profession, conjoins a part of the medical with his academic studies during one session; and during the next, entering as a medical student proper, he is enabled to graduate at the close thereof with comparative ease. But the majority of the students who attend medical lectures in this institution do not graduate here. They spend one session in reaping its well-known advantages, and subsequently resort to the city schools to secure their degrees and profit by the facilities afforded for clinical instruction. As a class, the excellence of their preparation is recognised in all the leading city schools of this country, and this appreciation generally proves a ready passport to success in achieving their special objects. The University of Virginia is resorted to by many of the young men of the South, and by some from other sections, seeking higher culture in literature and science as well as in the learned professions. They bring with them the well-marked characteristics of a manly, sincere and generous people, and form a fraternity, the source of pleasant recollections and beneficial influences in after life. The opportunity thus afforded of forming associations with contemporaries who are to be the cultivated and leading men of their day throughout a wide section of country, is not unworthy of regard by those who are preparing for the medical profession. This consideration, in addition to the ample facilities for special and professional instruction as the tastes and purposes of the student may dictate, will, it is believed, continue to invite to the Medical Department not only Southern students, but also students from the North and West, who may wish to attend an institution comprehensive in its plan and organization, catholic in its teachings, and national in its spirit. Laboratory Course of Medical Chemistry. ? In addition to the usual course of Medical Lectures, a special course, for such medical students as may desire to pursue it, of sixteen lessons in the practical applications of Chemistry to Medicine (the detection of poisons, chemical and microscopic examinations of animal products, urine, blood, &amp;c.), will be given by the Professor of Analytical Chemistry at a charge of $20 tuition-fee and $5 for laboratory material consumed. Attendance on this special course is optional with the student. ? The expenses of the medical student amount to $386 per session of nine months, commencing 1st of October; or if a student messes, to $296 per session. (See Expenses, page 56.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">3 Law Department. JOHN B. MINOR, LL. D., Professor of Common and Statute Law. STEPHEN O. SOUTHALL, LL. D., Professor of Civil, International and Constitutional Law and Equity. This Department is organized with a view to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through text-books and partly through lectures, with daily examinations upon both. A Moot-Court in connection with other instruction tends to perfect the student in the details of practice. Under the immediate supervision of the Professors, he is required to pronounce opinions upon supposed cases; to devise and institute remedies by suit or otherwise; to conduct suits at law and in equity from their inception through all their stages; to draw wills, conveyances and other assurances; and in short to perform most of the functions of a practising lawyer. The Department comprises two Schools, each of which is divided into two classes, and the course of study is as follows:— SCHOOL OF COMMON AND STATUTE LAW. Professor Minor. Junior Class.— Blackstone's Commentaries, Synopsis of Criminal Law, Synopsis of Common and Statute Law, Chitty on Contracts. Senior Class.— Stephen on Pleading, Kent's Commentaries, Law of Executors, &amp;c. ? For reference.— Virginia Code (1860), Brightley's Digest of United States SCHOOL OF EQUITY, MERCANTILE AND INTERNATIONAL, CONSTITUTIONAL AND CIVIL LAW, AND GOVERNMENT. Professor Southall. Junior Class.— Vattel's International Law, Lectures on Government, Federalist. Senior Class.— Smith's Mercantile Law, Greenleaf's Evidence, Barton's Suit in Equity, Adams' Equity. In the Department of Law, the degree of Bachelor of Law is conferred upon those who, upon examination conducted in writing, manifest an intimate acquaintance with the subjects taught in all the classes; and to those who, upon like examination, exhibit a competent knowledge of International and Constitutional Law, and of the Science of Government, a certificate of proficiency is awarded. The expenses of the Law student, as will be seen from page 57 of Catalogue, amount to about $356 for a session of nine months, commencing 1st October, 1872; or if a student messes, to $266 per session.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Agricultural Department. JOHN R. PAGE, M. D., Professor of Natural History, Experimental and Practical Agriculture. JOHN W. MALLET, LL. D., M. D., Professor of General and Applied Chemistry. LEOPOLD J. BŒCK, Ph. D., Professor of Applied Mathematics and Engineering. FRANK P. DUNNINGTON, B. Sc., C. &amp; M. E., Adjunct Professor of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry. The late Samuel Miller, of Lynchburg, having by deed given in trust one hundred thousand dollars for the establishment of a Department of Scientific and Practical Agriculture at the University of Virginia, the Trustees under this deed met the Rector and Visitors of the University on the 17th of September 1869, and arrangements were made for putting the said department in operation. These arrangements have subsequently, by action taken at various times, been extended and added to, the above named Professors have been nominated by the Trustees of the "Miller Fund" and elected by the Board of Visitors of the University, certain lands belonging to the University have been set aside and brought into cultivation as an Experimental Farm, a machine for the manufacture of drain tiles has been imported from England and put in operation, and implements, apparatus, models and specimens of various kinds have been collected as material aids to the course of instruction. In this, as in all the other departments of the University, entire freedom of choice is left to the student as to the schools he shall attend and the order in which he shall attend them, and this choice will be influenced in individual cases by the nature and extent of previous preparation as well as by difference of ulterior aim: but a student of average ability, who has already had a fair general education, and who comes to the University with the intention of devoting himself to the study of the principles upon which agriculture is based, will probably do well to select for the first year Natural Philosophy (Jun. Class), Chemistry (general), Natural History and Mineralogy and Geology, and for the second year Scientific and Practical Agriculture, Agricultural and Industrial Chemistry (including the first Laboratory class of Analytical Chemistry) and Agricultural Engineering. This arrangement of studies may with advantage be expanded to a course for three years, or may be varied by the selection of other Schools when deemed desirable. For the method of study in the respective Schools, reference should be made to the preceding pages of this catalogue. MILLER AGRICULTURAL SCHOLARSHIPS. With a portion of the means supplied by the donation of Mr. Miller there have been established in connection with the Agricultural Department two scholarships, each of five hundred dollars per annum, and tenable for two years (one to be filled and one vacated in each year), to be competed for at a special examination upon the whole of the subjects taught in the department, to be held near the close of each session. Candidates for this examination to be already graduates in the studies of the department. Scholars thus elected will be expected to continue their studies during the term of their scholarships, and to render such assistance in the minor duties of instruction, in the performance of analyses and researches, as may be required of them. It is hoped that thus the opportunity may be afforded the successful competitors of becoming thoroughly competent in their chosen direction of study, worthy of public confidence in regard to all the purposes which their special knowledge may subserve, and that even during their tenure of the scholarships in question they may be able to render useful service in connection with agricultural experiments, the examination and analysis of agricultural and other materials of general interest. They will be subject to no charge for tuition in the schools of the department during the two years, but will be expected to defray the expense of material they may consume in the chemical laboratory.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">LICENTIATES. Any person of unexceptional character and habits, upon producing to the Faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity and attainments, will be licensed by the Faculty to form classes for private instruction in any School of the University, in aid of and in conformity to the public teachings of the Professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment, selection and compensation of any such Licentiate is left to the option of the students. SCHEME OF LECTURES. 8h. to 9h. 9h. to 10h. 10h. to 11h. 11h. to 12½h. 12½h. to 2h. 3h. to 4½h.

      <field name="fulltext">EXAMINATIONS. The examinations are of three kinds: 1, the Daily examinations; 2, the Intermediate and Final general examinations; and 3, the examinations for Graduation. DAILY EXAMINATIONS. Each Professor, before commencing the lecture of the day, examines his class orally on the subject of the preceding lecture as developed in the text-book and expounded in the lecture. GENERAL EXAMINATIONS. Two general examinations of each class are held during the session in the presence of a committee of the Faculty, which every student is required to stand. The first, called the Intermediate examination, is held about the middle of the session, and embraces in its scope the subjects of instruction in the first half of the course. The second, called the Final examination, is held in the closing week of the session, and embraces the subjects treated of in the second half of the course. These examinations are conducted in writing. The questions propounded have each numerical values attached to them. If the answers of the student are valued in the aggregate at not less than three-fourths of the aggregate values assigned to the questions, he is ranked in the first division; if less than three-fourths and more than one-half, in the second division; if less than one-half and more than one-fourth, in the third division; and if less than one-fourth, in the fourth division. Certificates of distinction are awarded to those who attain the first division at one or both of these examinations, and their names are published or announced in the closing exercises of the session. The general examinations are sufficiently comprehensive and difficult to render it impossible for the student without steady diligence to secure a place in the first division. The results, whatever they may be, are communicated to parents and guardians respectively in the final circular of the session. The standing of the student at the daily and general examinations is taken into account in ascertaining his qualifications for graduation in any of the schools. EXAMINATIONS FOR GRADUATION. The examinations for graduation are held in the last month of the session. They are conducted in each school by the Professor thereof in the presence of two other Professors, forming with him the committee of examination for the school. The candidates for graduation are subjected to searching interrogations on the details and niceties as well as the leading principles of the subject, and they are expected to be accurately versed in all the topics treated of in the lectures and correlative text. These examinations are chiefly carried on in writing; but in some of the schools they are partly oral. ? As a due acquaintance with the English language is indispensable to the attainment of any of the honors of the Institution, all candidates for graduation are required to exhibit in their examinations due qualifications in this respect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">DEGREES. The degrees conferred by the University are Academic and Professional. The Academic Degrees are: 1. That of Proficient — conferred for satisfactory attainments in certain subjects of study, to wit: in Anglo-Saxon, the Junior and Intermediate Course of Mathematics, Mineralogy and Geology, Physics, Physiology, Medical Jurisprudence, Human Anatomy, Botany, Political Economy, History, Literature, International Law and Government, and Industrial Chemistry. 2. That of Graduate in a School — conferred for satisfactory attainments in the leading subjects of instruction in the same, to wit: in the Latin Language and Literature, in the Greek Language and Literature, in the French Language and Literature, in the German Language and Literature, Mixed Mathematics, Pure Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Moral Philosophy, History and Literature, Applied Mathematics, and Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry. 3. That of Bachelor of Letters — conferred upon such students as have graduated in the schools of Ancient and Modern Languages, Moral Philosophy, and History and Literature. 4. That of Bachelor of Science — conferred on such students as have graduated in the schools of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, and Chemistry, and who are Proficients in the classes of Mineralogy and Geology, and who have obtained distinctions in the Junior Class of Applied Mathematics, and made satisfactory attainments in the first Laboratory Class of Analytical Chemistry. 5. That of Bachelor of Arts — conferred on such students as have graduated in Latin, Greek, Chemistry, Moral Philosophy, and French or German, and have obtained certificates of proficiency in Junior and Intermediate Mathematics, Physics, and History or Literature. 6. That of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia — conferred upon students who have graduated in the Latin, Greek, French and German Languages, Pure Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Moral Philosophy, and History and Literature, and who have passed satisfactory general examinations, in review, on all the subjects embraced in the courses of these schools. The candidate for the degree of Bachelor or Master of Arts is also required to submit to the approval of the Faculty an essay, composed by himself, on some subject of literature or science, which essay must be read by the author on the Public Day, if so ordered. The Professional Degrees are: 1. That of Bachelor of Law — conferred for satisfactory attainments in all the subjects of instruction in the schools of Law. 2. That of Doctor of Medicine — conferred for satisfactory attainments in all the subjects of instruction, except Botany, in the several schools constituting the Medical Department. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine, who have been previously declared Graduates in Chemistry, or Proficients in Anatomy, Physiology, or Medical Jurisprudence, are not required to stand the examinations on these subjects anew; and the same rule applies to candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Law who are Proficients in International Law and Government. 3. That of Civil Engineer — conferred on such students as have graduated in the schools of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Applied Mathematics, and Chemistry or Industrial Chemistry (Proficiency in the Lecture course), and obtained a certificate of proficiency in Mineralogy and Geology. 4. That of Mining Engineer — conferred on such students as have graduated in the schools of Chemistry, (including Industrial Chemistry), Analytical Chemistry, and Natural Philosophy, and obtained certificates of proficiency in Junior and Intermediate Mathematics, in a prescribed course of Applied Mathematics, and in Mineralogy and Geology. 5. That of Civil and Mining Engineer — conferred on such students as have graduated in Pure Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, including Mineralogy and Geology, Chemistry, (including Industrial Chemistry), Applied Mathematics, and Analytical Chemistry. PUBLIC DAY. On the closing day of the session, which occurs on the Thursday before the fourth day of July, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers, and Students of the University assemble in the Public Hall — whither also the friends of the students and the public generally are invited. On this occasion the results of the examinations are announced, certificates and diplomas awarded, and addresses delivered by the Bachelors and Masters of Arts.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EXPENSES. The charges common to all classes of students, if two occupy the same room, are as follows: Matriculation and library fee $30.00 Room-rent 15 00 Contingent deposit 10 00 Infirmary fee 7 50 Fuel and lights, about 25 00 Board, including diet, room furniture, and servants' attendance 180 00 Washing $1.50 per month — per session 13 50 $281 00 By messing the board may be reduced to $90, and thus the expenses above enumerated may be reduced to $186. The tuition fees of Academic students attending three schools (the usual number attended in one session) amount to $75; of Law students to $80; of students of Civil Engineering, attending three schools, to $100; and of Medical students to $110. Adding tuition fees to the above estimate of common expenses ($276), gives the aggregate of the necessary expenses of students, exclusive of text-books, clothing and pocket-money, as follows: By messing. Academic students $351 $261 Law students 356 266 Engineering students 366 276 Medical students 386 296 The following are the fees for the students of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry: For the first Laboratory class $50, and an additional charge of $10 for Laboratory material consumed. For the second Laboratory class $100, and a charge of $25 for Laboratory material consumed. For the third Laboratory class (special course for Medical students) $20, and a charge of $5 for Laboratory material consumed. Each Laboratory student, in whatever course of instruction, will be required to furnish himself with the more common and generally necessary articles of apparatus. The cost of a suitable set need not exceed $15. For the course of lectures on Agricultural Chemistry, if taken without the Laboratory course, $15; but Laboratory students of any class are entitled to attend these lectures free of charge. All the foregoing items are payable in advance, except board and washing. One-third ($60) of the board is required on admission, and the balance in equal instalments at three and six months thereafter. Washing is paid for monthly, as the service is rendered. The contingent deposit is designed to cover any assessments that may be made against the student during the session for violation of the rules of the library, damage to books, room, &amp;c. The residue less these assessments, which are generally small, and may be nothing, is refunded to the student on the settlement of his account at the close of the session. The Faculty is authorized to extend to deserving young men, who are unable to incur the expenses of their education at this Institution without aid, a credit of three years, without security and without interest, for their tuition fees, the student executing his bond for the amount. INFIRMARY. There is a well-appointed infirmary connected with the University for the care and comfort of sick students. Every student on admission deposits the infirmary fee ($7.50), which entitles him in case of sickness during the session to the advice and attention of the infirmary physicians (Professors in the Medical Department), and if necessary, nursing by professional nurses without additional charge. BOARDING HOUSES. There are three large boarding-houses within the precincts of the University, and several outside, but in the immediate vicinity. At these nearly all the students find accommodations, and at charges essentially the same. Some find accommodations in private families; some also, for the sake of economy, mess together and board themselves. To secure rooms in the University buildings, application may be made by letter to the Proctor; but if the rent is not deposited with him before the 15th of September, the room is considered to be unengaged. LATE ENTRANCE AND WITHDRAWAL. No abatement is made in the matriculation and tuition fees and room-rent on account of late entrance, unless the student enters after the first of January, and no portion of the same is refunded on account of withdrawal before the close of the session, unless the withdrawal be rendered necessary by ill health, and occur before the first of March. The charges for board, fuel, lights and washing are estimated from the time of entrance. Many disadvantages to the student result from late entrance; therefore prompt attendance at the beginning of the session is earnestly enjoined upon all who wish to derive the full benefits of the courses of instruction. PROHIBITION OF CREDIT. An act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students. The license to contract debts, which the chairman is authorised to grant, is confined (except when the parent or guardian otherwise in writing requests) to cases of urgent necessity; and these, it is hoped, parents and guardians will as far as possible prevent from arising by the timely supply of the requisite funds. PRIVILEGED STUDENTS. Ministers of the Gospel may attend any of the schools of the University without the payment of fees to the Professors. The same privilege will be extended to any young man preparing for the ministry, on condition that he shall submit testimonials that he is a bona fide candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. LIBRARY. Wm. Wertenbaker, Librarian. The library of the University, originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, and since enlarged by purchases and donations, now contains about 35,000 volumes. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the librarian is present in the library for four hours daily to attend to their wants.</field>

There are two Literary Societies (the Washington Society and the Jefferson Society) of long standing connected with the University. They meet weekly in their respective halls for the purpose of cultivating debate and composition, and occasionally hold public exhibitions. The annual oration before the two Societies will be delivered on the 2d of July, by Hon. Thos. F. Bayard, of Delaware. DISCIPLINE. Morality and Religion are recognised as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience has proved that the best way to effect this result is to forbear the employment of coercion, and the attendance on religious exercises is entirely voluntary. Prayers are held every morning in the chapel, and divine service is performed on Sunday by a chaplain selected in turn from the principal religious denominations. YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. By means of a Young Men's Christian Association new-comers are brought under good influences, and the energies of students willing to engage in the active Christian enterprises of the neighborhood are called into exercise. FRIENDS OF TEMPERANCE. The Friends of Temperance are represented by University Council No. 46, an association which has done good service in guarding young men against dangerous excesses, and in promoting literary and moral culture. MONTHLY CIRCULAR. At the end of every month a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from lectures and examinations, and any other irregularity of which he may have been guilty, together with such further information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate. The object of such report being on the one hand to incite the student to steady diligence by eliciting the commendation and encouragement of his friends, and on the other to restrain him from idleness and disorder, or to urge him to amendment by their admonition and advice, the usefulness of these circulars greatly depends upon the prompt and judicious attention they receive from those to whom they are addressed. Parents and guardians therefore cannot be too earnest in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly report may suggest. UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS. Eleven Scholarships, entitling the successful candidates at a competitive examination to prosecute their studies for one session at the University of Virginia without the payment of matriculation fees or tuition fees, will be open to new-comers from all the States at the beginning of the next academic year (October 1st). Of these eleven Scholarships five are in the Academic Department, and two each in the departments of Law, of Medicine, and of Industrial Chemistry, Civil and Mining Engineering and Agriculture. The examination is uniform, and embraces Latin, Greek, Mathematics, and English; and in order to secure positive attainments the right is reserved to reject any papers that do not reach the standard required for distinction at the Final Examination in Junior Latin, Junior Greek, and Junior Mathematics, and do not show a competent acquaintance with the grammatical and rhetorical structure of the English language. MILLER SCHOLARSHIPS. In addition to these scholarships there are two in the Agricultural Department, the conditions of which have already been stated on page 52. STATE SCHOLARSHIPS. To render education at the University accessible to meritorious young men of limited means, provision has been made by the Legislature for the admission of one student from each Senatorial District of the State without payment of matriculation and tuition fees and rents, an amount of $120 to $150 according to the schools taken. This provision is meant to be restricted to those who themselves are unable, and whose parents are unable, to incur the expense of their education at this Institution without aid. State students are appointed by the Faculty upon satisfactory testimonials of fitness. The term of appointment is for two years, but for extraordinary proficiency it may be prolonged. They stand in all respects except expense on the same footing as other students, enjoying the same privileges and subject to the same laws. By way of remuneration to the State for the aid thus afforded them, they are required on admission to sign an engagement to teach in some public or private school in Virginia for two years after leaving the University, the emoluments of such service enuring of course to their own benefit. Mode of Applying for Appointment. The applicant for a State appointment must state his age (which must be at least seventeen) and designate the Schools of the University he may wish to enter. He must submit satisfactory testimonials of irreproachable moral character and of capacity, as well by partial cultivation as original vigor of mind, to profit by the instruction given at the University, and of the fact that neither he nor his parents are able to incur the expense of his education without aid. The Faculty will proceed on the 29th day of June, 1872, to make appointments of State students for vacant districts. The following are the districts under the new Constitution, all of which, except those indicated by an asterisk, will be vacant at the close of the present session. ?
