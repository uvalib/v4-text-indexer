      <field name="fulltext">GENERAL STATEMENT. The development of separate schools of Commerce and Business Administration in the colleges and universities of the United States has taken place within a comparatively recent period. Only three such schools had been established prior to 1900, but since that year the teaching of Economics, Commerce and Business Administration has had a rapid development. Separate schools exist in a score or more of the larger institutions and nearly all schools of collegiate grade offer one or more courses in the field. The large demand for business training developed somewhat less rapidly in the colleges and universities of the South than in those of the Northern States. Owing partly to this fact and partly also to an insufficiency of funds for the establishment of new departments, the growth of Business Schools in the South has taken place almost entirely in less than a decade. Courses in Political Economy have been given by the University from the opening of its doors to students in 1825 continuously to the present time. Some of the courses taught at the beginning were, the Principles of Political Economy, Money and Banking and Statistics. Later a course in Sociology was given. From 1825 to 1868 the work formed a part of the School of Moral Philosophy, and after that date was connected with the School of History. In 1906 the School of Economics was established separately. In 1915 the University extended the work already being given in Economics by the addition of courses in Business Law and Economic Geography. In response to the insistent demand which came during and since the World War, the following courses were added to the School of Economics in 1918: Accounting, Statistics, Money and Banking, International Trade, Business Organization and Corporation Finance. Several other courses were offered a year later. In 1920 President Alderman in a statement on the needs of the University spoke as follows: "The University has for years sought to train for his career the great lawyer, doctor, engineer and teacher. It most earnestly seeks the opportunity to train the great business man for his career in these days of great specialization and amazing opportunity which await the country and South in this field. Something much greater and wider than the ordinary business college is contemplated. The complexity of the modern industrial and commercial situation is bewildering unless special training is provided. We owe something to this vocation which absorbs two-thirds of our youth. The training we propose would not be calculated to lead a youth to look merely for a higher rate of interest or profit, but would fit him to compete with all comers in interstate and international trade, to keep faith with everybody, to understand foreign languages and peoples, and to comprehend the laws and methods of wise and just commerce." In 1920 the School of Commerce and Business Administration was organized and in the spring of 1921 Mr. Paul Goodloe McIntire gave the University the sum of $200,000 as an endowment for the School. As the result of Mr. McIntire's gift, the income from which becomes available with the session of 1922-1923, it is expected that the University will be enabled as soon as the present organization is completed to take a leading position in business instruction in Southern Universities. The faculty has been increased by the appointment of three new members for the session of 1922-1923 and special lecturers will supplement the work of the regular faculty from time to time. A well defined course of study leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Commerce has been established.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">AIMS AND STANDARDS. It is the aim of the School to maintain a high standard of scholarship as a requirement for graduation. The degree is conferred only upon such students as have shown themselves capable of mastering the prescribed course of study. Due emphasis will be placed on the fundamental principles and methods underlying business. It is the aim of the School also to further the development of the professional point of view.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. The entrance requirements for the School are those of the Department of the College. For admission to any department of the University, the general conditions are the following: 1. Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years; the faculty advise seventeen or more. 2. Good Character.âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate preparation.âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the requirements for admission to the several departments of the University. For admission to the College the candidate must present a certificate or pass an equivalent examination, and should possess an amount of preparation which is at least the equivalent of that represented by four years of successful work in an accredited school. He must offer, either by certificate or by examination, fifteen units, of which three must be in English, two and one-half in Mathematics, and one in History. In addition to the above, each candidate must pass at the University a qualifying examination in English before his registration can be completed. A complete statement of the requirements for admission will be found in the catalogue published by the Department of the College and in the general catalogue of the University.</field>
