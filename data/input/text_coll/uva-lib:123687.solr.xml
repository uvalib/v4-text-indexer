He must present a certificate of honorable withdrawal from the school last attended, or other valid proof of general good character. He must further satisfy the Dean of the University as to his adequate preparation for the work by passing the Entrance Examinations specified below or by the presentation of equivalent certificates of preparation signed by the president of a recognized institution of collegiate rank, or by the principal of an accredited high school. The topics required for entrance and their values in units are as follows, the unit being one year's work on the subject in an accredited high school: English A.âGrammar and Grammatical Analysis 1 English B.âComposition and Rhetoric 1 English C.âCritical Study of Specimens of Literature 1 Mathematics A1.âAlgebra to Quadratics 1 Mathematics A2.âQuadratics, Progressions, Binomial Formula 1 Mathematics B.âPlane Geometry 1 Mathematics C.âSolid Geometry Â½ Mathematics D.âPlane Trigonometry Â½ History.âAncient; MediÃ¦val; English; American (any one) 1 Electives 7 Total 15 High school students who expect to study Engineering are advised to include among their electives at least one Foreign Language (Latin or French or German), one Science (Chemistry or Physics with adequate laboratory work) and an additional unit of History. Other electives which may be profitably offered are History of English and American Literature, Greek, Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, Physical Geography. A candidate may be admitted as a Conditioned Student in spite of some deficiencies in required entrance subjects, provided these are not such as will impair the integrity of his work, but he must submit not less than 15 units. No such candidate will be conditioned except upon subjects actually taught in this university, nor will any candidate be conditioned on more than two units; and all conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the next session after initial registration. Courses taken for the removal of entrance conditions may in no case be counted as part of the work credited for any degree. No conditions will be allowed in English A or B or in Mathematics A1, A2, or B. As the table of Entrance Requirements shows, the full High School course in Mathematics is required for entrance to the Department of Engineering, but unfortunately the graduates of the High Schools are often deficient in Solid Geometry and Plane Trigonometry and can be admitted only upon conditions in those subjects. High School principals are advised to urge their graduates, with this status, to attend a Summer Session at the University before entering the Department of Engineering so that these deficiencies may be overcome. If the prospective student finds it impossible to attend a Summer School previous to his regular matriculation, a course has been planned which will allow him to make up his deficiencies by taking work in the Summer School following his first year in Engineering. This course provides for Trigonometry, Solid Geometry and College Algebra in the three terms of the regular session, with the other work as outlined for the regular student, and in addition, in the two terms of the Summer School, Analytical and CoÃ¶rdinate Geometry are taken. Such a program will prepare the student for entrance with Sophomore standing and will save him from the failure usually encountered by students who attempt to make up the deficient work in regular session in addition to the full course of required subjects. A candidate may be admitted as a Special Student, without formal examination, provided he is more than twenty years old if a Virginian and not less than twenty-three years old if a non-Virginian, and gives evidence of serious purpose and of fitness to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for any degree. No conditioned student may register later as a special student. ADMISSION OF WOMEN Women are admitted as candidates for the Engineering Degrees but not as Special Students. A candidate must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present certificates showing graduation from an accredited public high-school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private school, with credit for not less than fifteen college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for fifteen en-trance-units, of at least thirty session-hours, (sixty semester-hours) of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. ADVANCED STANDING Under the elective system of the University of Virginia, a student who has completed courses of college or university grade in other institutions of learning on mathematical or scientific subjects may be excused from attendance upon these courses by the Dean, with the advice and consent of the professor in charge, and will then be registered for the more advanced work, provided the full entrance requirements have been satisfied. In order to secure College Credit upon such courses toward a degree in Engineering from this University, the applicant must showâ 1. That the courses offered are coextensive with the corresponding courses as given in the University of Virginia. 2. That his grades on them were not below the seventy-five per cent. pass-mark of this University. Such credits may be granted by the faculty upon the recommendation of the Dean and the professors in charge; but are automatically revoked by the failure of the student to pass in the more advanced courses in the related topics. Advanced standing in the technical engineering subjects of higher grade than those of the Sophomore year will not be given except to graduates of other institutions offering technical engineering instruction and then only upon special consideration of each application for such advanced standing. No degree in Engineering will be awarded for less than one full year's work in a regular session of this University and the work of a candidate's last year must be performed in residence here. The same rules apply to Credits on Summer School Courses; except that for courses in the Summer School of this University the examination questions must be prepared by the professor in charge of the regular course, and the answers must be read and graded by him. Students, suspended from other universities, are not granted college credit on courses previously passed, except upon the explicit recommendation of the suspending university, and after such additional tests as this Engineering Faculty may impose. Credits on Practice-Courses in Drawing, Shop-work, or Field-work may be granted to applicants who have gained in professional practice the training which these courses represent. Such applicants must file with the Dean proper certificates from the official under whom the work was done and must in every case pass an additional practical test on the subjects for which credit is desired. College credit is not granted for high-school work. PROGRAMS OF STUDY The candidate who has satisfied the requirements for entrance as above defined is matriculated as a student of Engineering and admitted to the Freshman Class. The studies of this class comprise lecture courses in English, Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Chemistry with associated laboratory courses in Chemistry, Drawing, Shop-work and Field-work. For advancement to the Sophomore Class the student must have completed at least two-thirds of his Freshman work. Upon entering this class the student majoring in Chemical Engineering begins his specialized work, while all others pursue identical courses of study through the year. On entering the Junior year each student elects his specialty. The courses thereafter diverge according to the major subject chosen by the student. Programs of study for each degree are given below. The courses are so ordered that the specified entrance requirements are adequate for the work of the Freshman Year. Each succeeding year pre-supposes the completion of the work for all the foregoing years. Students are advised to adhere strictly to the regular programs. The arrangements specified in them have been carefully planned and are the best. Departures from the curriculum will in almost every case produce conflicts in lecture hours or laboratory periods and may cost the student a year's time. Haphazard election is discouraged and in extreme cases will be prohibited. No student will be registered for a course unless, in the opinion both of the Dean and of the professor, his preliminary training has fitted him for the profitable pursuit of that course. Students are especially advised against the attempt to crowd too many studies into their scheme of work, and are warned that admission to advanced courses will be granted only to those who have adequate mathematical and scientific training to profit by them. Men overloaded with work, too great in volume or in difficulty for their powers, suffer inevitable discouragement and incur almost certain failure. Changes of classes with transfer of fees may be made, subject to the approval of the Dean, within two weeks after the beginning of any term. Thereafter such changes may be made only by special order of the faculty, and then without transfer of fees. Upon the completion of the four years' course as defined in any one of the Programs of Study, the faculty will award to any student in regular and honorable standing the degree of Bachelor of Science in Engineering. Upon the completion of the additional Graduate Course in a satisfactory manner the faculty will award the appropriate degree of Civil Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Chemical Engineer, or Mining Engineer. The new five-year curriculum has been adopted at the University of Virginia in view of the impressive and growing demand from practicing engineers and industrial leaders that Schools of Engineering should enlarge the field of study to embrace more of the humanities and better opportunities for student research, to the end that graduates may be better fitted to undertake their duties as engineers and citizens.

STUDENT BRANCHES OF NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES There have been established at the University of Virginia Student Branches of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (1912), the American Society of Civil Engineers (1921) and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (1922). These societies hold regular meetings for the discussion of periodical literature and the exposition by resident and visiting engineers of the present-day problems in Engineering. A valuable feature of the meetings is the opportunity presented for practice in public speaking and debate. At stated meetings the Branches hold joint sessions for the discussion of mutually interesting questions. TAU BETA PI In May, 1921, a chapter of the National Honorary Engineering Fraternity Tau Beta Pi was granted and the Alpha of Virginia Chapter of Tau Beta Pi will henceforth serve to further inspire high scholarship and integrity. This fraternity is recognized as the leading honorary engineering fraternity of this country and its chapters are found in a limited number of engineering schools of the highest standing. The members are elected with care and the standards maintained are rigid both in respect to scholarship and character. THETA TAU In June, 1923, a chapter of the National Engineering Fraternity of Theta Tau was granted at the University of Virginia. This fraternity has chapters in a score or more of the leading engineering schools of the country and membership is eagerly sought and greatly appreciated by the members of the student body. Elections are made each year based on scholarship and general record of ability and promise of future service to the profession of engineering. ENGINEERING JOURNAL During the session of 1920-1921 the University of Virginia Journal of Engineering was first issued. The Journal is published by the Students of Applied Science and is issued nine times yearly. Contributions are made by students, instructors and alumni and the Journal gives to the students especially an opportunity to take part in an activity of interest and value while providing a medium in which may be published results of individual experience and research.

The examination day for a particular course is indicated in the table above by the Roman numeral in the first or last columns, for the corresponding lecture hours in the middle column. The examination period covers ten days at the end of each term. Examination days change each term. A change in lecture for any course will change the examination day correspondingly. Classes for which lecture periods are not indicated will have examination days fixed by the arranged lecture hour in accordance with above schedule. EXPENSES OF REGULAR STUDENTS The average annual expense of a student who pursues the regular course in Engineering will be: NonVirginians Virginians University Fee $ 60 $ 50 Tuition 165 120 Laboratory Fees (average) 35 35 Living Expenses (for nine months) 400 400 Books and Drawing Materials 30 30 Incidental Expenses (for nine months) 60 60 Total annual for average conditions $750 $695 The charges for Tuition are uniform to all students, except that Virginians are relieved of tuition on courses offered in the College, this exception saving regular Freshmen from Virginia $110 and all other Virginia students $60 each year in comparison with non-Virginians. The laboratory charges are $15 per class for the year's course in Physics, and $20 per class for a year's course in Chemistry. A deposit for breakage of $5 is required for each laboratory course in Chemistry. The fee for each practice course in the Engineering Department, Drawing, Engineering Laboratories, and Shop-work is $5 per term for each course. The fees for Field-work and Bridge Drafting are each $10 per term per course. These fees include all charges for laboratory materials; but the student is held further responsible for breakage. The Living Expenses include board, lodging, fuel and lights, servant and laundry; the average is $10.00 per week, the minimum $7.50, and a reasonable maximum $12.50. Books and Drawing Materials will cost about $120 for the four-year course. Incidental Expenses ought to be kept within modest bounds; the above estimate is sufficient; large allowances of pocket money promote idleness and attract companions of the baser sort. No allowances are included for clothing and travel, the expenses for which vary too much to be introduced into any general estimate. The charges payable on entrance are the University Fee, and the Tuition and Laboratory Fees. EXAMINATIONS AND REPORTS Oral examinations are held at the beginning of each lecture hour on the topics of the preceding lecture. Written test papers are set monthly, or at such interval as the professor may appoint. Absences from lecture except by reason of sickness are not excused without a written leave from the Dean. Class standing is determined on the basis of the oral examinations and the written tests. Absence from the latter or failure to answer incurs a zero grade. Absences from laboratory periods, however caused, must be made up by special private arrangement with the instructor. Written examinations are held at the end of each term on the entire work of that term. The result of examination combined with the student's class-standing gives his term-grade. The pass-mark is seventy-five per cent. Absence from the written term examination incurs a zero term-grade, which may not be removed except by the passage of a special written examination on the work of that term. Such special examinations are granted only upon presentation of a written certificate from a reputable physician that the student by reason of sickness on the day of the regular examination was unable to attend. Regular Reports are sent out at the end of every term to the student's parent or guardian. These state for each course followed the term-grade and the number of absences. Further comment may be added by the Dean or the professor, if it appears probable that such comment would be helpful to the student. Parents are urged to examine these reports carefully and to exert such parental influence as may seem needed to establish and confirm the student in habits of industry and order. Special Reports are sent to parents at the end of each month for students delinquent in attendance or studiousness and for delinquents only. When a student is making steady progress and showing due diligence in his work, only the regular reports are sent. The receipt of a special report is evidence that, in the judgment of the faculty, prompt and pointed parental admonition is urgently needed. If in any class in the Department of Engineering a student fails to make satisfactory progress, he is first admonished by the professor in charge. In default of prompt and permanent improvement, he is next formally warned by the Dean. If due amendment is then not immediately effected, the student's name is dropped from the rolls of the Department, on the ground that he is not accomplishing the purposes for which he should have entered upon a University course of study. REGULATIONS The following regulations, adopted to define the policy of the faculty, are published for the information and guidance of the students: 1. Practice-courses as well as lecture-courses must be conducted under the Honor System. The student who submits any work to be graded is considered to submit it under pledge. 2. When the lecture-course and the associated practice-course are given in the same term of the same year, no student will be admitted to examination on the lecture-course until he has completed at least three-fourths of the practice-course. 3. No student will be admitted to any practice-course unless he is at the same time pursuing the associated lecture-course, or has already received credit for the same. 4. No student will be admitted to the graduating examination on a lecture-course unless he has been present at more than half the lectures in that course. 5. In the technical courses in Engineering (i. e., courses not given in the College) term-grades shall not be averaged; except that the term-grades for Freshman Applied Mathematics may be averaged for the first-year men only, provided no mark is below 65. 6. The pass-mark in every course is 75. Class standing and written examination are combined for the term grade in such proportions as the several professors may determine. 7. No student who fails to make 75 on term-grade shall be granted another examination on the course until he has again attended lectures on that course. 8. Special examinations are not given except by reason of sickness on the day of examination, attested by the written certificate of a reputable physician, or for other like providential causes. In every case they must be validated by special vote of the faculty. 9. Any engineering student who fails to attain a passing grade of 75 on at least 9 term-hours will be placed on probation for the following term, probation to continue until at least 9 term-hours are passed in one term. No engineering student shall remain on probation for more than three terms, whether consecutive or not, in his entire engineering course. If probation is imposed a fourth time the student shall be suspended. 10. Any engineering student on probation who fails to attain a passing grade of 75 on at least 6 term-hours and whose average grade on all courses taken is less than 65 will be suspended. Any engineering student who passes less than 6 term-hours and whose average grade on all courses taken is less than 65 will be suspended. Suspension during a session continues for the remainder of the regular session. Suspension imposed at the end of a session holds for the whole of a subsequent session, except that such suspension may be absolved by the successful completion of prescribed work in the Summer Quarter. No engineering student suspended for a second time shall re-enter the department. 11. The Dean's List.âA student, who, in any session, passes on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 18 session-hours, with an average grade on all courses of not less than 82 per cent, will be placed on the Dean's List. A student, who, in any session, passes on all courses taken aggregating not less than 18 session-hours, but who does not average 82 per cent, and who, in any subsequent term, passes on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 18 term-hours, with an average grade on all 18 term-hours of not less than 82 per cent will be placed on the Dean's List. A student will be automatically dropped from the Dean's List, if, in any term, he does not pass on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 18 term-hours, with an average grade on all courses of not less than 82 per cent. A student dropped from the Dean's List will be again placed on it if he meets the above mentioned standard for a term. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting the issuance of leaves of absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone. Students on the Dean's list must attend all laboratory classes and must perform all written problem work and take all written quizzes under the same conditions as all other students. DRAFTING ROOMS The drafting rooms are abundantly lighted and are provided with solidly constructed tables with locked drawers for instruments and materials. Each student is assigned to a table and has a drawer for his exclusive use. The regular Drawing Classes execute each one plate a week under the supervision of the Instructors in Drawing. The more advanced students have such additional drawings assigned by their respective professors as are needed for the full development of the courses of study. Careful attention is given to the training of the students in free-hand lettering, in the conventional signs of mechanical drawing, in the proper layout of drawings, and in neat and accurate execution. Exercises are required also in tracing and in blue-printing, the rooms for which are conveniently arranged and in close contiguity to the drafting rooms. A vertical blue-printing machine with arc lamp, complete with trays, has recently been procured and installed. While, however, technical dexterity is demanded, the graphical method is taught and used primarily as an indispensable instrument of research, the thoughtful mastery of which is essential for the instructed Engineer. The construction and theory of the Polar Planimeter, the Slide Rule, and the Pantograph are carefully taught, and the student is trained in the practical use of these appliances for the rapid and accurate production of estimates and copies from finished drawings. SHOPS The Machine shop is provided with six first-class engine lathes, illustrating the practice of the best American makers; with a planer, a shaper, two drill presses, a universal milling machine (Brown &amp; Sharpe), and a universal grinder (same makers); also with a gas forge for tempering tools, a cut-off saw for metal rods, an emery wheel, grindstone, and so on. The wood shop is furnished with five small lathes, a large pattern-maker's lathe, a jointer, a planer, a saw bench for slitting and cross-cutting, a band-saw, a jig-saw, and a wood trimmer for pattern-making, six cabinetmaker's benches, and an ample supply of hand tools. EXPERIMENTAL ENGINEERING LABORATORIES Road Materials Laboratory.âThe apparatus for tests of non-bituminous road materials includes a two-cylinder Deval abrasion machine, a ball mill, a moulding press for briquettes of rock dust, a Page impact cementation tester, a Page impact toughness tester, a rock crusher and a Purdue brick rattler. This outfit the University owes to the generous aid of the late Dr. Logan Waller Page. In addition, the Department has acquired a 40,000-pound compression tester, a diamond core drill, a diamond rock saw, a grinding lap, a Westphal balance, specific gravity apparatus, and a complete set of sieves. Useful researches in the road-building rocks and gravels of Virginia, as well as the standard tests, are conducted each year by the class in Civil Engineering. The apparatus for tests of bituminous road materials includes the New York Testing Laboratory penetrometer, the Kirschbaum ductility machine, the Engler viscosimeter, the asphalt viscosimeter, the New York Testing Laboratory extractor, the New York State Board of Health oil tester, Hubbard pyknometers, asphalt flow plates, gas and electric hot plates, and the accessory apparatus needed for research on bituminous road-binders.

They are also required to make up their field-books in standard forms; to reduce their surveys and execute all the necessary profiles, plans and maps; and to determine lengths, areas, and volumes both from the maps and from the original notes. Polar planimeters are provided for facilitating such estimates, and a pantograph for making reduced copies of finished drawings. ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY The Scott Laboratory of Electrical Engineering.âThis laboratory was initially equipped and endowed by Mrs. Frances Branch Scott, of Richmond, Va., as a memorial to her late son, an alumnus of this University. During the year 1910 the equipment was substantially increased through the generosity of the Hon. Charles R. Crane, of Chicago, Ill., a friend of the University. Substantial additions of machines, measuring instruments, control apparatus, and auxiliaries are being made regularly in order to keep the equipment in the best order for laboratory work. In addition to a supply from the University Power Plant the laboratory is furnished from the Virginia Public Service Company through a synchronous motor driving an alternator and three-wire direct current generator, with two exciters, all on a common shaft. A complete three-panel switchboard for the control of this set is equipped with full sets of instruments and controls including a voltage regulator for the alternating current generator. The entire laboratory wiring has been renewed and the floors have been treated to eliminate dust. Universal plug and receptacle-connections facilitate the setting up of all experimental combinations. For the machine testing there are available two direct-current motor generator sets with automatic push-button start and stop control complete, several direct current motors and generators, series, shunt and compound; steam-turbine-driven three-phase alternator with exciter and control switchboard; experimental test set for alternating current single or polyphase generator operation or induction motor testing; a second test set with modern switchboard control panel and driving motor with automatic start, stop, and reverse equipment; single-phase repulsion-induction motor; two-and three-phase induction motors; double-current generator; several pairs of constant potential transformers; current transformer for constant current service; mercury arc rectifier set; Prony brakes for all motors; variable resistances; variable inductances and capacities; meters for measuring frequency, power factor, and indicators of synchronism and grounded circuits. A complete three-element oscillograph set with all accessories is available. In addition to full sets of electric meters with the appliances for testing and calibrating them, galvanometers of the best modern types, standard cells and resistances, standard condensers, and other pieces of apparatus for minor tests, this laboratory contains numerous pieces of the very best construction. Such are the Wolff potentiometer, the Seimens and Halske Thomson double bridge, the Koepsel permeameter, the Station photometer with Lummer-Brodhun screen, Macbeth illuminometer, the Carey-Foster bridge and others. BUILDINGS The buildings devoted wholly or in part to the work of the Department of Engineering are the following: The Mechanical Laboratory is the main seat of the instruction in technical studies. It is 180 by 70 feet and contains on the main floor the Dean's office and the offices of three other professors; and three lecture-rooms. Above are an office, a small drafting room for advanced students, and blue-print and photographic rooms. Below on the ground floor are an office and classroom, the electrical laboratories, the testing laboratories, apparatus and storerooms, and the students' lavatory. In order to more adequately care for increased numbers this building has undergone a considerable rearrangement during recent years. Wood and machine shop equipment has been entirely removed from the building, as well as the facilities for Freshman and Sophomore Drawing. This change made available much needed classroom space and allowed the electrical laboratories to be expanded. Incident to the changes new cement floors were constructed for the Road Materials Testing Laboratory, the main testing Laboratory and the main hall. A new high-pressure steam line from the Power House was also installed. The Shops are now temporarily housed in the Garage erected for the Motor Truck Training Detachment during the World War. This building gives a floor space of some 5,000 square feet and has allowed the rearrangement of wood and machine shop equipment for group drive by four electric motors. Space is also available in this structure for use in connection with the course in automobile construction and testing. The Drawing Room is temporarily housed near Peabody Hall in one of the Barracks taken from the Training Camp site and rebuilt and fitted for drawing. The building accommodates about 180 men, each man having his individual drawing desk. The Power House is a single-story building 110 by 40 feet. It contains the University boiler plant and the electric lighting plant. The Boiler plant consists of two horizontal return-tubular boilers, each of 140 horsepower. The lighting plant consists of three electric generators directly connected to high-speed engines, the respective capacities being 25, 50, and 75 kilowatts. The whole plant is available for purposes of instruction, study and experiment. In addition to the University plants there are available by courtesy of the owners for purposes of inspection, study and tests such plants as the turbine station and railway and power substation of the Virginia Public Service Company, the water turbines and oil engine plant of the Charlottesville Woolen Mills, and plants of the local ice companies and cold storage. The Geological Museum is 120 by 50 feet. It is a three story building. The main floor is devoted to the very extensive geological collection of specimens, charts, relief maps, and so on. The gallery above contains an equally good collection of minerals and numerous models of typical crystallographic forms. The upper floor contains the lecture-rooms and the laboratories of Economic Geology. In the basement are stored subsidiary collections and new material accumulated in more recent geological surveys. The Physical Laboratory faces the Mechanical Laboratory on the opposite side of the quadrangle, and has almost the same proportions. The main floor contains the lecture-room, the professors' offices, the laboratory of experimental physics, and the storeroom for the very large collection of apparatus used in the lectures. On the ground floor is the laboratory of theoretical electricity, the storage battery room, a well-equipped shop for the repair and manufacture of apparatus, and smaller rooms for the work of graduate students. The new Chemical Laboratory was opened for use in September, 1917. In this fire-proof structure all the work in Chemistry is assembled. The floor area provided is about 30,000 square feet. The lecture-rooms seat classes of 300, 75 and 25 students. The laboratories assigned to General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Qualitative Analysis, Quantitative Analysis, and Physical Chemistry contain 110, 60, 40, 30, and 20 desks. Altogether by dividing classes into sections, 600 students may be accommodated. Smaller private laboratories are provided for research workers. Large stock rooms communicating by elevators with the several floors contain ample stores of chemical supplies. The 5,000 volumes of books and bound sets of journals constituting the Departmental Library of Chemistry are so housed as to be accessible to both teachers and students.
