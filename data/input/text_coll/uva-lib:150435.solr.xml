      <field name="fulltext">THE UNIVERSITY RECORD Vol. 1 Charlottesville, Va., September, 1907 No. 1 The University Record is published monthly, except July and August, by the University of Virginia, for the purpose of disseminating information regarding the University, its organization, activities, and growth. The Record is intended primarily for the alumni and friends of the Institution and for the press of the State, but will be sent to any address upon receipt of the subscription price, 25 cents a year. Second-class postage rates have been applied for. New Grouping of Subjects for the B. A. Degree, as Adopted June 10, 1907. Resolved, that the B. A. Degree be conferred upon any student who, after satisfying the entrance requirements, completes (unless admitted to advanced standing) the work in (1) English Literature 1 and Mathematics 1; (2) two subjects, one of which must be Latin, from the first of the groups given below, one from the second, two from the third, one from the fourth, and one from the fifth; (3) a varying number of electives-at-large, viz., three, in case only one ancient language is included; and two, in case both ancient languages are included. These electives-at-large may be either B. A. courses, or M. A. courses in subjects of which the precedent B. A. courses have been completed. In every case, however, at least two of the electives-at-large must be chosen from a single groupâto be known as the candidate's major groupâwhile the others may be chosen from the above-mentioned groups or from the following miscellaneous list of courses, viz., Biology 2, Biology 3, Analytical Chemistry 1, Education 2, Journalism, and Biblical History and Literature. It is provided, however, that any candidate may be excused from the electives-at-large, if in lieu thereof he passes the First-year Law course, the First-year Medical course, or any three technical courses in Engineering. It is also enacted that every First-year College student who contemplates the possibility of taking the B. A. Degree shall be required (unless admitted to advanced standing) to take English Literature 1, Mathematics 1, Latin 1, or some other foreign language, and one course in the third group (or Greek, in case the student wishes to take both ancient languages). Students fulfilling this requirement shall be registered in the catalogue under the general head of "The College," and under the sub-head "Candidates for the B. A. Degree"; while all college students (except special students) declining to take this prescribed course shall be registered under the sub-head "Not Candidates for the B. A. Degree." Students admitted to the University as "Special Students" (see catalogue, p. 83) shall be separately registered as such in the catalogue. The Groups mentioned above are as follows: I. Languages. Latin 1 and 2. Greek 2 and 3. French 2. German 2. Spanish 2. English 1 (a course including Anglo-Saxon and middle English as well as modern English). II. Mathematical Sciences. Mathematics 2. Mechanics 1. Astronomy 1. Electricity and Magnetism. III. Natural Sciences. Chemistry 1. Physics 1. Biology 1. Geology 1. IV. History, Literature and Economics. History 1. Economics 1. English Literature 2 or 3. V. Philosophical Sciences. Logic. Psychology. Ethics. Education 1. Calendar for September, 1907. Tuesday, the 10th, to Friday, the 13th, Entrance Examinations. Thursday, the 12th, Beginning of Eighty-third Session. Thursday, the 12th, to Saturday the 14th, Registration Days. Monday, the 16th, Beginning of Lecture Courses. Saturday, the 28th, University Convocation. Rules Regulating Class Standing in Professor Minor's Law Courses. 1. There will be held during a portion of each lecture a written quiz on the topics discussed in the text assigned for the day and the lecture thereon; and about the end of each month a quiz in writing may be held embracing the work already covered in the course. If the written answers are upon more than one sheet, the sheets must be securely fastened together. 2. The answers will be graded, and the average of the grades in all the lectures of the course will constitute the student's class standing. 3. For graduation in the course the class standing will be reckoned at twenty-five per cent. and the examination at seventy-five per cent. of a possible hundred; that is, in estimating the session's grade of the student, twenty-five per cent. of his average class grade will be added to seventy-five per cent. of his examination grade, and the aggregate will constitute his grade for the whole course. 4. In estimating the class grade, a failure, without legal excuse, to hand in a paper upon the written quiz will count as a total failure for that recitation. Absence with legal excuse, or a legally excused failure to hand in a paper, will count as if a paper worth seventy per cent. had been handed in. But no excuse will be received, unless presented to, and accepted by, the professor at the first lecture of the course following such absences or failures. 5. Attention is called to the provision of the catalogue of the University that "In case of delayed entrance, the student is regarded as having been absent from all lectures or other exercises that have been given, in the courses in which he enters, since the beginning of the session." Such absences will be "excused" if the student is permitted by the president of the University to register without penalty. 6. A student having optional attendance upon a course, and standing the regular examination with the class or one standing a special examination thereon, will have his class grade during the last year of his attendance upon the course counted in with his grade upon such examination. 7. To all papers handed in for class grade the pledge must be appended and properly signed. Otherwise the paper will be treated as a total failure. 8. The oral quiz during the lecture is not hereby abrogated. With variations in certain particulars, the above plan for combining the class grade with the examination grade is substantially the same that has been employed for several years with much success by Prof. R. H. Dabney, in his history classes. Messrs. C. M. Chichester and A. S. Robertson, graduates of last year, have been appointed assistants in the law department, in order to meet the expanding methods of the work. Mr. A. M. Dobie, a member of the class of 1904, and since a practicing lawyer of St. Louis, Mo., will instruct Prof. Lile's classes during the latter's year of absence in Europe. New Buildings. The college dining hall (refectory) is being pushed rapidly toward completion. It occupies a position just a few rods north of the Mechanical Laboratory, at the southwest end of West Range. Its location is most convenient and accessible, and it will add immeasurably to the comforts and economies of the student body at large, but especially of those on the Lawn and Ranges, in the Randall Building and on Dawson's Row. The second wing of the Hospital is to be completed and equipped by the opening of the present session. The central building, flanked by the two wings, presents an imposing and elegant appearance architecturally; and with the increased room and equipment the usefulness of the institution is materially enlarged. It is now possible to furnish constantly no less than one hundred beds. The faculty committee on the University exhibit at Jamestown has recently issued an attractive fifteen-page catalogue of the various treasures and articles placed at the exposition for the inspection of the public. In the catalogue the collection is listed under 62 heads; and it evidently represents in an appropriate manner almost every phase of the University's life and character. In the several schools, held at the University and various other places in Virginia during the past summer, under the direction of the State authorities, no less than twenty-five teachers and alumni of the University took part as instructors. The reading room in Madison Hall, for the use of professors and students, is elegantly furnished and well supplied with books, magazines, and newspapers. All that a fellow needs to do, in order to enjoy himself there, is simply to act the entleman and keep quiet. New Chemical, Physiological, and Pathological Laboratories. No less than four excellent laboratories have been provided for the opening session in buildings long familiar in other capacities. The houses at the northeast end of West Range, formerly employed by Mr. Henry Massie, and latterly by Mrs. Isabel Perkinson, as dining halls, have been remodeled inside and fitted up with first-class apparatus. These houses, in this new capacity, are to be under the direction of Dr. Theodore Hough. The building towards the Rotunda has been transformed into a laboratory for physiological chemistry; the part flush with West Range into a laboratory for experimental physiology. In the basement of these buildings rooms have been arranged for the experimental practice of medicine upon animals. In one apartment of the basement floor is the furnace for heating the rooms on West Range. At the southwest end of the Range equally commodious and convenient quarters have been provided for the classes of Prof. R. M. Bird, in the house formerly occupied by Dr. A. H. Buckmaster, latterly, by Prof. Bruce R. Payne, and in the wing adjoining. The Buckmaster house, practically without change, is to be used for store-rooms, offices, and small laboratories. The adjoining wing, in which years ago Miss Ross conducted a boarding house, has been renovated and remodeled on the interior and converted into two elegant rooms, one above, one below. The basement floor has been refitted as a laboratory for undergraduate general chemistry; the upper room has been turned into an excellently equipped laboratory for similar purposes, but may also be used as a lecture room. This room, comprising the two small and uninviting lecture halls of recent memory, is now one of the most convenient and attractive rooms at the University. Dr. Bird's rooms will be known as West Range Chemical Laboratory, to distinguish them from those of Dr. Mallet and Prof. Dunnington, in the Chemical Laboratory a few rods to the northwest. University Publications. The Alumni Bulletin is published quarterly by a committee of the faculty. As the name indicates, this magazine is intended to contain articles and items of special interest to the alumni of the institution; yet it is at the same time a periodical of more or less general interest. It also serves as a sort of convenient and permanent record, or chronicle, of the important events and achievements in the life of the University, as well as of many in the careers of the alumni. Its historical value will be enhanced with the lapse of time. Each issue contains about 100 pages; the yearly subscription price is $1.00 a year. The University Record.âThis is a new periodical, issued monthly except July and August, at the nominal price of 25 cents a year. The pages are of the same size as those of the Alumni Bulletin, but the number of pages may vary considerably from time to time, as the needs of the occasion require. This publication is intended to serve the convenience of the press, the alumni, the students, and the public generally, by presenting in concise form timely announcements and official information regarding the condition, progress, and plans of the University. Students will find the Record of particular value for quick reference in respect to many phases of their courses and classes. The University of Virginia Magazine is published monthly, eight times during the school year, and is intended not only for the instruction and entertainment of the student body and the reading public, but also for the encouragement and development of literary taste and skill among the young men of the University, by placing in their hands the opportunity for practical journalism, governed constantly by the highest standards and ideals. Each number of the magazine contains from 80 to 100 pages, filled with stories, essays, poems, reviews, and easy chair chats. A prize of the value of $25 is given each year for the best story, and two others of equal value for the best essay and poem, respectively. Under the editorship of Mr. L. R. Whipple, and the supervision of the Kent school of literature, the magazine will doubtless maintain, if not advance, the high rank it has occupied for years among the best college publications of America. The subscription price is $1.50. College Topics, the University newspaper, is a large sheet of eight pages, published weekly or semi-weekly, during the greater part of the session, at the subscription price of $2 a year. The athletic and social life of the University are presented in detail through the Topics columns. Corks and Curls.âA splendid annual, representing practically all of the phases of college life, is published under this title by a board of editors chosen from the Greek Letter fraternities. The number of this year (1907) is volume XX; and, like those of the several preceding sessions, is a handsomely printed, illustrated, and bound quarto of some 300 pages, selling at $3. The Y. M. C. A. Handbook.âAt the opening of each session there is distributed to the students from Madison Hall, the Y. M. C. A. building, a vest-pocket handbook, in which is given a mass of information that every man in college needs to have at his finger's end. In form for ready consultation, the handbook presents the calendar for the year, schedules of lectures and examinations, gives the accepted yells and most familiar songs, and commends itself in numberless ways as a vade mecum to every student. University Directory.âAbout October 25 of each session the managers of the Young Men's Christian Association complete and issue gratis from Madison Hall a full directory, bound in size convenient for the pocket, giving the names and college addresses of all students. The Association Record.âThis is a pamphlet issued at the close of each session, giving a complete record of the year's religious work of the University. Copies may be obtained from Dr. H. M. McIlhany, the general secretary of the Y. M. C. A. Madison Hall Notes is a four-page weekly, published by the Association, and distributed free to professors and students. It will be sent to other persons by mail for a small subscription price. It contains reports and announcements of all religious activities at the University, together with many other things of interest, and gives each week on the last page the official bulletin of the University for the succeeding week. Every student, particularly every new student, should attend the informal opening reception given to the students in Madison Hall, one evening within the first week of the session. Notice of the date of the meeting will be posted.</field>
