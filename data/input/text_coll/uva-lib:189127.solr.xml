      <field name="fulltext">A SURVEY OF RESEARCH MATERIALS IN VIRGINIA LIBRARIES INTRODUCTION This is an attempt at a survey of the research possibilities in Virginia libraries. It has been undertaken as the Virginia section of a project embracing thirteen southern states: Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. This project is being supervised by a Committee on Resources of Southern Libraries of which Mr. Robert B. Downs of the University of North Carolina is Chairman and Mr. Wilmer L. Hall of the Virginia State Library and Mr. Harry Clemons of the University of Virginia are the Virginia members. This Committee itself is a regional unit of a Board on Resources of American Libraries of which Dr. William Warner Bishop of the University of Michigan is Chairman. Both Committee and Board bear appoint-from the American Library Association. The Virginia survey has been compiled by Mr. Clemons; and the combined survey of the thirteen southern states is being compiled by Mr. Downs. The work of this combined survey has been facilitated by a grant from the General Education Board. A degree of uniformity in the survey has been attained by the use of a special guide for the description and evaluation of research materials prepared by Mr. Downs with some assistance from the committee on southern libraries. A further result of the use of this guide has been to make the report something more than a list of special collections. In actual use any special collection requires support from both general and bibliographical materials in the particular subject and also, to some degree, in related subjects. The research possibilities of a region depend on the strength of its libraries in fundamentals as well as on the presence of special and unique material. From this point of view it is a matter of interest that a library which can at present make little claim to the possession of significant research materials is giving evidence of wise selection in the acquisition of its standard sets, bibliographic works, and periodical files. This larger aim of the survey has naturally added to its difficulties; and any hope of carrying it through has had to depend on the willingness of Virginia librarians to cooperate. But so notable has been the willingness that it has actually become the outstanding feature of the whole Virginia project. This survey itself will in a few months become merely a momentary glimpse at one stage of a changing and accelerating development. But that scores of librarians were willing to sacrifice literally hundreds of hours of work to make such a general survey possible affords evidence of a spirit of cooperation and of devotion to a common goal that is in itself a vital and lasting resource for library development. No full list of those who have thus cooperated has been attempted. A brief suggestion of the extent of such a roll call may, however, be included. The project was endorsed by two annual meetings of the Virginia Library Association. At the disposal of the compiler was placed the material collected for the very useful `Handbook of Virginia Libraries' which was compiled in 1936 by a Committee of Junior Librarians â this Handbook itself being an excellent example of cooperation. At twenty-three libraries preliminary surveys were carried through by the local staffs through the use of the `Guide for the Description and Evaluation of Research Materials' â a document which in its extent throws into the shade even the questionnaires prepared by the Federal Government. It is known that in one Virginia Library over twenty staff members contributed time and effort towards the filling out of this questionnaire for the local collections. Four tours were made, east, west, north, and south, from central Charlottesville by Messrs. Cappon, Wyllie, and Clemons of the University of Virginia Library in order to visit some of these twenty-three and to cover other libraries. Effective help was given at all stages of the work by Mr. Hall, the State Librarian. The first draft of this survey was read by Dr. E. G. Swem of the College of William and Mary, by Messrs. Hall and Randolph W. Church of the State Library, and by Messrs. Cappon, Dalton, and Wyllie of the University of Virginia. If anyone seriously attempts to peruse the text which follows, he will be able to appreciate the quantity of this contribution of these librarians. The quality of this contribution of theirs must fortunately remain unknown, for it includes the errors that have been corrected in this final draft. But even their untiring efforts are liable not to have been entirely successful; and for the errors that remain the Virginia compiler regrets that he must be held solely responsible. To him also must be charged the tedious delays in the process of compilation. The collection of statistics on which this survey is based was practically completed in the academic year 1936-37, and as a document in the history of Virginia libraries it should therefore bear that date.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART ONE - GENERAL CLASSES Section A. General Reference Materials. The most comprehensive collections on bibliography in Virginia are at the Virginia State Library, the College of William and Mary, Sweet Briar College, and the University of Virginia. The largest, at the State Library, contains 3,220 volumes. Bibliographical material of some note is scattered through thirty or more libraries in the State. This scattered condition, which is characteristic of all divisions of research material, may be illustrated at the outset by reference to certain foreign encyclopaedias. For example, various Larousse publications are located at the Coast Artillery School at Old Point Comfort, at the College of William and Mary, at Randolph-Macon College at Ashland, at the Randolph-Macon Woman's College, at the Richmond Public Library, at Sweet Briar College, at the University of Richmond and the University of Virginia, at the Virginia Military Institute, at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, at the State Library, and at Washington and Lee University. Copies of La Grande EncyclopÃ©die may be found at the Coast Artillery School, at Hollins College, at the Richmond Public Library, at Sweet Briar, and at Washington and Lee. Brockhaus' Konversationslexikon may be consulted at Sweet Briar, the University of Virginia, and the State Library; and Meyer's Konversations-lexikon at the College of William and Mary, Randolph-Macon, Randolph-Macon Woman's College, Sweet Briar, and Washington and Lee. Copies of the Enciclopedia Italiana are at the Richmond Public Library, at Sweet Briar, at the University of Virginia, and at Washington and Lee; and the last three libraries have the Spanish Enciclopedia universal ilustrada Europeo-Americana. The collections of dictionaries offer another significant example of the scattered situation in Virginia. There are many libraries in the State which deserve consideration because commendable beginnings have been made in the acquisition of the fundamental materials. The present stage of development, however, is one in which library after library repeats the more ordinary works and very few have so far been able to acquire any considerable number of items of distinction. The more comprehensive collections of dictionaries are to be found at the Coast Artillery School, the State Library, Sweet Briar, the College of William and Mary, and the University of Virginia. The last, comprising about 500 volumes, is perhaps the largest. That at the Coast Artillery School* * The library of the Coast Artillery School at Old Point Comfort is operated for the military personnel of the School. It is not equipped or prepared to accommodate non-military users in general. Nevertheless, there is an expressed desire to cooperate with qualified non-military research workers; and requests for use of this library from such workers, when recommended by a responsible librarian, will be considered on their merits. is useful and varied, and includes dictionaries of sundry tribes of American Indians. Section B. Bibliography. For bibliographical material, libraries in Virginia have the geographical advantage of easy access to the resources of the Library of Congress. Local bibliographical collections are making progress in effectiveness; but there is much distance to go before any of them can lay claim to complete adequacy. Depositories of Library of Congress printed cards are located at the Coast Artillery School (partial), at Hampton Institute (partial), at the State Library, and at the University of Virginia. The College of William and Mary receives all Americana and Virginiana cards. The State Library, Washington and Lee University, and the University of Virginia are are subscribers to the new edition of the printed book catalogue of the British Museum. The University Library receives also the general catalogue of the BibliothÃ¨que Nationale, the Gesamtkatalog der Preuissischen Bibliotheken, the cards printed by the Library at the Vatican, the genealogical cards compiled by a committee of American librarians with headquarters at Wesleyan University, and the Shakespeare cards issued from the Folger Library in Washington. Book catalogues of other libraries are scattered among half a dozen collections. For example, the catalogue of the Astor Library is at the State and the University Libraries; the catalogue of the Boston Athenaeum is at William and Mary, the State Library, and the University Library; the catalogue of the Carnegie Library is at the Randolph-Macon Woman's College, at the Richmond Public Library, at William and Mary, and at the University of Virginia; and the Peabody Institute catalogue is at the Randolph-Macon Woman's College, the State Library, Washington and Lee, William and Mary, and the University of Virginia. Similar conditions prevail with regard to the general bibliographies. Brunet is to be found at most of the libraries already mentioned and at the Union Theological Seminary in Richmond; Hain is at Washington and Lee, Graesse and the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegandrucke are at the University of Virginia, and Sweet Briar possesses copies of the British Museum Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century. Of the American national bibliographies, Evans and Sabin are to be found at the State Library, Washington and Lee, and the University of Virginia. These three libraries and Hampton Institute, Hollins College, and Randolph-Macon Woman's College have the English Catalogue; and the same three and William and Mary have copies of Lowndes' Bibliographer's Manual of English Literature. Other foreign national bibliographies are infrequent, though the University of Virginia has an incomplete set of Hinrich's FÃ¼nfjahrskatalog, Washington and Lee and the University of Virginia have Lorenz's Catalogue GÃ©nÃ©ral de la Librairie FranÃ§aise; and the State Library and the University of Virginia have Arber's Term Catalogues. The H. W. Wilson Company seems to have found a fair market for its index publications in Virginia, most of the libraries so far named and a number of others, including the four State Teachers' Colleges, subscribing to one or more. The same is true of the New York Times Index; and Dr. Lester J. Cappon's recent bibliography, `Virginia Newspapers, 1821-1935', has found its way into a considerable number of Virginia libraries. Available in Richmond is a typescript union list of periodicals currently received by nine Richmond libraries, compiled by Miss Mary L. Garland. The State Library, Washington and Lee, William and Mary, and the University of Virginia subscribe to the Bibliographical Society of America Papers; and the State and the University Libraries receive two or three of the foreign bibliographical journals and society papers. But in general, Virginia libraries are not notable for foreign bibliographical or documentary publications. Strength in subject bibliographies is also scattered, and no single library has at present an adequate collection that includes all subjects. In philosophy and psychology the University of Virginia is perhaps strongest. In religion the Episcopal Theological Seminary in Alexandria and the Union Theological Seminary (Presbyterian) in Richmond are outstanding. In the social sciences fairly good collections of subject bibliographies are to be found at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the State Library, the College of William and Mary, and the University of Virginia; and the Hampton Institute Library is strong in education and the Negro. In science reasonably adequate bibliographies are located at the Randolph-Macon Woman's College, at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, at Washington and Lee, at William and Mary, and at the University of Virginia. For technology one finds good bibliographical equipment at the State Library, at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and at the University of Virginia; the Medical College of Virginia, at Richmond, is notable for medicine; and there is an important collection of bibliographic material on naval science at the Mariners' Museum* * The Mariners' Museum, which is conveniently equipped for research workers, contains various manuscript and unpublished bibliographies on naval subjects. near Newport News. The College of William and Mary and the University of Virginia appear to be best supplied in the fine arts. Most of the libraries mentioned in this paragraph and some others, such as the Richmond Public Library, have given considerable attention to bibliographic material in literature and history. Special card bibliographies are being compiled in several Virginia libraries; as, for example, on miscellaneous military subjects at the Library of the Coast Artillery School, on Robert E. Lee books and manuscripts* * Data on the manuscripts appear in John B. Nicholson, Jr.'s M.A. thesis (1936), General Robert Edward Lee 1807-1870, a preliminary bibliography. This is on file in the Washington and Lee Library. at Washington and Lee University, and on Virginiana at William and Mary and at the University of Virginia. Akin to these are the archival undertakings at the State Library and at the University of Virginia, and the activities in Virginia of the Historical Records Survey under the Works Progress Administration. For the University project, conducted by Dr. Lester J. Cappon, there have recently appeared the bibliography `Virginia Newspapers, 1821-1935', which has already been mentioned, and various bibliographies published in Doctor Cappon's annual reports. There are useful collections on the history of books and libraries at the University of Richmond, at the University of Virginia, and at Sweet Briar. Some emphasis on this general subject is evident also in the collections at the Farmville State Teachers College, at Hollins College, at the State Library, and at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Specimens of incunabula are rare, there being a few examples at the Randolph-Macon Woman's College, at the Richmond Academy of Medicine, at the Union Theological Seminary, at Washington and Lee, at the Packard-Laird Memorial Library of the Virginia Episcopal Theological Seminary, and at the University of Virginia. The collection of early Americana at William and Mary, the Williamsburg material at the Library of Colonial Williamsburg, Incorporated, the Miller Collection of old medical works at the Richmond Academy of Medicine, and the sixteenth century volumes on geography and travel and on the astrolabe at the Mariners' Museum are notable. Section C. Library Science. The most effective collection of library science materials in Virginia is at the College of William and Mary, in connection with the training school for teacher librarians. This consists of about 800 volumes in library science itself, supplemented by 3,900 volumes specially selected from other subjects as being best fitted as library material for the different school grades. Other useful collections, smaller in extent, are at the Hampton Institute, for the service of its Library School for Negroes, and at the University of Virginia in connection with its summer quarter courses for high school librarians. The State Library also has considerable material on this subject; and the same is true of the four State Teachers Colleges, the Virginia Military Institute, and the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Section D. Dissertations. Definite statements with regard to collections of theses and dissertations have at present to be limited, since in a number of libraries such material is not distinguished from the regular collections of books and pamphlets. There are indications, however, that the recent tendency towards publication of annual volumes of abstracts and the increasing demand for the inter-library loan of local theses and dissertations is drawing attention to the need of a more effective handling of this material. In several college libraries a start has been made by the segregation of theses and dissertations prepared by members of the local faculty. Somewhat more extensive collections may be found at the University of Richmond, at the Union Theological Seminary, at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and at Washington and Lee University; and there is a special set of about 100 Dutch theses on marine insurance and marine law at the library of the Mariners' Museum. The largest collection is at the University of Virginia, and its availability is being increased by the recent adoption of a special method of handling all pamphlet material. Annual volumes of abstracts of dissertations are being issued at the University of Virginia under the supervision of Mr. John Cook Wyllie, a member of the library staff; and he has also prepared, in connection with annual volumes of Publications and Research, printed and numbered lists of all University of Virginia theses and dissertations from their beginning. Many of the Virginia libraries have on file the general bibliographies of American theses, but foreign bibliographies on this subject are woefully lacking. Section E. Documents. The largest collection of local Virginia documents is at the University of Virginia, the Bureau of Public Administration Library and the Virginia Collection in the General Library combining to total 2,000 or more items. The State Library also has a collection of considerable size. In state documents the State Library leads, having 15,000 to 20,000 Virginia documents and approximately 50,000 from other states. These figures do not include the sets in the State Law Library. The College of William and Mary has also given emphasis to the collection of Virginia state documents. There is a growing collection of state documents at the University of Virginia; and the Library of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute if effectively supplied with state publications on agriculture, conservation, geology, mines, and taxation. To be a complete depository of United States federal documents appears to be impossible unless pending legislation greatly increases the availability of the material now being issued from Washington. But the State Library, the College of William and Mary (since March 1936), and the University of Virginia have been officially designated as complete depositories. Partial collections are currently received by Bridgewater College, Emory and Henry College, Hampden-Sydney College, the Norfolk Public Library, Roanoke College, Sweet Briar College, the University of Richmond, Virginia Military Institute, and Washington and Lee University. The number of foreign documents available in the State is very limited. Virginia Polytechnic Institute has a scattered collection of about 350 volumes, sets of World War Records may be found at the Coast Artillery School and the University of Virginia, and the latter and Sweet Briar College have considerable runs of Great Britain Parliamentary Debates. Section F. Manuscripts. Virginia has been a happy hunting ground for manuscripts, the hunters including not a few sharpshooters from other States. There are several notable collections within the State's boundaries; and information concerning the fairly numerous smaller and special collections is likely to prove of service for research. The largest collection in Virginia is at the State Library and comprises approximately 1,500,000 items. These are limited to Virginia and cover the history of the Commonwealth from the early seventeenth century to the present. The collection is filed and accessible for use, and the following printed calendars have been issued:- Eckenrode, H. J. Calendar of Legislative Petitions Arranged by Counties, Accomac-Bedford. Richmond, 1908. 302 pp. (No more issued) [Eckenrode, H. J. List of Manuscripts Exhibited by the Virginia State Library and the Virginia Historical Society at the Jamestown Exposition.] In Fourth Annual Report of the State Library. Richmond, 1907. pp.66-100. Kennedy, John P. Virginia State Library. Calendar of Transcripts... Richmond, 1905. 658, xliv pp. Palmer, William P. (and others). Calendar of Virginia State Papers and Other Manuscripts ...

Richmond, 1913. 20 pp. Swem, E. G. A List of Manuscripts Recently Deposited in the Virginia State Library by the State Auditor ... Richmond, 1914. 32 pp. Aside from the archival material, which includes manuscript records of the Commonwealth and of some of its governmental subdivisions and letters and papers of the governors and other officials, there may be noted the following collections:- the Abercrombie letter books (1746-1773), the Allason papers (17231815), the Emma Read Ball collection concerning the Ball family, the Beaumarchais papers (American Revolution), thirty-eight pieces, the William Brent, Jr., miscellany, 1821-39 (including copies of certain original deeds, plats, etc., dated 1651-1757), the N. F. Cabell papers (1722-1879), the Campbell-Brown letters (1793-1886), the papers of the Society of the Cincinnati (17831810), the George Rogers Clark papers, 19,958 pieces, the Captain James Culbertson collection concerning Augusta County during the Revolutionary period, 421 pieces, the letter book of Andrew Dunscomb (February 1784-February 1787), the Francis Walker Gilmer letters (1800-1830), John Hook's letter book (1772-99) and twenty-seven letters written to him by various persons but mostly by David Ross, the Lee-Custis letters, sixty-four pieces, the McBryde papers concerning the presidency of the University of Virginia, the Angus W. MacDonald papers, being chiefly lists of documents comprising the MacDonald transcripts, the Martin papers, the farm journal of William Massie, of Nelson County, 1819-44, the letter book of William Nelson (1766-73) and of Thomas Nelson, Jr. (1772-75), the J. Ross Perkins collection of 116 Confederate letters written by several soldiers in the Ross family, the W. B. Rogers collection in regard to the Virginia geological survey, Edmund Ruffin's farm journal for Marlbourne (1844-51), a Southern Historical Society collection (1793-1815), being chiefly military papers of 1814, eighty-one pieces, and a small collection of the papers of George Washington. The State Library collection includes a considerable number of account books and diaries, oither originals or photostat copies. Among the original account books are those of a merchant of Alexandria (1823-28), of Patrick Henry (1770-74, 178395), of a merchant of Lynchburg (1832-37, 1865-66), of the Rev. James Morrison (1824-57) who is remembered for his connection with the First Independent Church of Richmond, of John, James, and B. Oliver, merchants in Caroline and Hanover Counties (17901800), in four volumes, of Samuel Patterson (1805-08), and of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, Richmond (1851-75). The diary originals include records by Charles Fenton Mercer of a trip abroad (1854-55, 1856-58), the Confederate diary in six volumes of George M. Neese, notes on a trip abraod by William L. Sheppard in 1860, and the thirteen volume diary of Colonel Taylor of Orange County (1786-99). A rough estimate of the number of manuscripts at the Library of the College of William and Mary, including the official papers of the College which are in the library vault, is from 150,000 to 175,000 pieces. These manuscripts are generally of Virginia families or of families related to Virginia families or to southern districts near Virginia. Some of them, more particularly the Southall papers, have been carefully arranged and an inventory is ready for use. The others are in process of arrangement. The more notable of the collections are the following:- Ambler papers, Alexander Balmaine journal, Berkeley family papers, Blackwell family papers, Brodnax papers, Buckingham Female Institute papers and ledgers, Landon Carter family papers, William Chamberlayne papers, Coupland family papers, the Flora Darling papers relating to patriotic societies, Dorsey family papers, the Gen. Jubal A. Early papers, the Col. Benjamin S. Ewell papers and his letters in relation to the College from 1854 to 1890, Huffman papers, the Robert M. Hughes collections relating (1) to the State Board of Law Examiners and (2) to William and Mary College from 1890 to 1935, the letters (143 pieces) written by Thomas Jefferson to William Short, Jerdone family papers, Gen. Joseph E. Johnston papers, Leavenworth family papers, McGavock family papers, the Madison papers (including both the President and the Bishop), the papers of John Marshall (about 150 pieces), Massey family papers, Merritt papers, the papers of James Monroe (about fifty pieces), the papers of the Rev. Robert Nelson, missionary to China, the minutes and papers of the Alpha Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa, the Robert Pleasants papers, the John Preston papers, Southall papers, Thweat family papers, Timberlake papers, P. N. Tyler papers, student notebooks of the University of Virginia 1830-80, and student notebooks of William and Mary College from 1790 to date, and the papers of the College of William and Mary including minutes of the Board of Visitors, of the faculty, and of the literary societies, and the books of the treasurer. A printed catalogue (120 pages) of the manuscripts in the collection of the Virginia Historical Society was issued in 1901 as a supplement to the Virginia Magazine of History and Biography. This extensive collection relates primarily to Virginia, and its items extend over the whole period of Virginia history to 1900. It is for the most part accessible for use. The most notable divisions of this material (including the accessions since 1901) are connected with such names as Adams, Ambler, Robert Anderson, Banks, John Barrett, Berkeley, Beverley, Black, Blair, Blakiston, Bland, Bolling, Byrd, Cabell, Campbell, Carter, Cary, Claiborne, Cocke, Custis, Bishop Early, George Gilmer, Harrison, Henry, Huntington, Johnson, Jefferson, Kent, Knox, Ludwell, Madison, Marshall, Massie, Monroe, Moseley, Powell, Raines, Randolph, the Donald Robertson School, Robinson, Semmes, Spotswood, and Washington â a veritable roll call of famous Virginia families. At the University of Virginia also the manuscripts â numbering approximately 500,000 items, a portion of which, however, are on deposit and are not owned by the University Library â are mainly a Virginia collection. They comprise lotters, diaries, account books, unpublished archives, and records of the University; and they are filed and partly catalogued. Of the manuscripts which are the property of the University Library the following are among the most important:- Blackwell papers, Brooke papers, E. P. Buford papers, Brunswick County (1890-1930), the Cabell collection, John Warwick Daniel papers, the Davis-Terrell papers from Albemarle County, the Francis Walker Gilmer letters, the Armistead Churchill Gordon papers and letter books, the Grinnan business letters and accounts (1770-1830), the Henry T. Harris papers of Nelson County, the Humphreys autobiographical letters, the John L. Burt papers of Pittsylvania County, the Gen. John D. Imboden papers (1831-95), the Thomas Jefferson collection, the Jones papers from Surry County, the Morris family papers from Hanover and Louisa Counties, the William Mullen papers, the Palmore papers and the Perkins letters from Cumberland County, the W. M. Seward records of Brunswick County, the Smiley family papers of Augusta County, the Stanard papers, the Sterrett family papers of Rockbridge County (1828-92), the John R. Thompson collection, the Twyman papers of Albemarle County, Joseph Waddell's diary (1855-59, 1862-65, four volumes), the Wallace family letters dating from 1750, and the Withrow papers, Waynesboro (1880-1910). Among the literary miscellany are the manuscripts of several books and of a number of fugitive pieces and autograph letters. The writers include Kate Bosher, Gamaliel Bradford, W. C. Brownell, Sarah Cleghorn, John Esten Cooke (Mohun), Arthur K. Davis, Jr. (Traditional Ballads of Virginia), Walter de la Mare, Lord Dunsany, Basil L. Gildersleeve, Armistead Churchill Gordon, J. H. Ingram (Life of Poe â a revision later than any of the published editions), Thomas Jefferson (Essay on the Anglo-Saxon), D. H. Lawrence, Amy Lowell, Percy Mackaye, Edwin Markham, Edgar Allan Poe, Edwin Arlington Robinson, Mary Stuart Smith (translations from the French of Pouvillon and from the German of Lenbach), Elizabeth Oakes Smith, Arthur Symons, and Marguerite Wilkinson. In Richmond, in addition to the manuscript material in the State Library and in the Virginia Historical Society, there are a number of smaller collections. For example, manuscripts relating to the history of the Confederacy are to be found at the Confederate Memorial Institute Battle Abbey Library and at the Confederate Museum Library. For the latter collection Dr. Douglas Southall Freeman in 1908 compiled A Calendar of Confederate Papers. At the library of the University of Richmond there are, the property of the Virginia Baptist Historical Society, several thousand items of material relating to the history of the Virginia Baptists, including church records, manuscript sermons, and the correspondence of J. L. M. Curry (1825-1903) and of George W. McDaniel (1875-1927). In the case of this collection, as has also been true of several other collections in the state, advantage has recently been taken of the aid afforded by the Historical Division of the Works Progress Administration for the arrangement and filing of manuscripts. Another collection significant for research in religious history is located at the Spence Library of the Union Theological Seminary in Richmond. For this is the official depository for the manuscript records of the Presbyterian Synods of Virginia and of North Carolina; and it also holds in custody many records of the Synods of Appalachia and West Virginia. This collection includes 297 manuscript volumes of synod and presbytery minutes, sessional and congregational records of individual churches, and 419 manuscript items, bundles of letters, and histories of churches. This material dates from 1755, and is accessible to any serious research student. Among the Presbyterian leaders represented are Archibald Alexander (1772-1851), George Addison Baxter (1771-1841), Robert Lewis Dabney (1820-98), Samuel Davies (1723-1761), William Hill (1769-1852), John Blair Hoge (1790-1826), Henry Patillo (1726-1801), and John Holt Rice (1777-1831). There is also a small collection of manuscripts, relating to the Episcopal Church in Virginia, which is housed in the library conducted in connection with the Mayo Memorial Church House in Richmond. The well known Poe Shrine shelters several autograph letters of Edgar Allan Poe. One more general collection in Richmond should be mentioned: that at the Valentine Museum. This includes a few European items, including autographs of Napoleon, Frederick the Great, and several noted scientists; and also about a hundred letters of Americans outside of Virginia: P. T. Barnum, Longfellow, Daniel Webster, and others. But here, too, the material is chiefly Virginiana, and comprises archives, business accounts and correspondence, family papers, and a literary miscellany. The nucleus is the extensive Valentine family collection covering the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Other material includes John Adams's accounts and business letters (1800-30), the Barron papers (1802-41) which include contemporary accounts of the naval war with Tripoli, the business records of John Bolling (1706-13) and of William Bolling (1804-14), Daniel Call's legal papers (1789-1830), Confederate manuscripts of the quartermaster department and of Generals Jackson and Lee, Patrick Henry's store accounts (1758-70), which, with the later account books in the State Library, give an unusually full record of his business transactions, the Norton papers (1760-1820), some of which were recently published in the volume* * John Norton &amp; Sons, merchants of London and Virginia, being the papers of their counting house; ed. by Frances Norton Mason, Richmond, Dietz Press, 1937. compiled by Frances Norton Mason, and the Robinson-Shields (1820-50) and Woods-Warwick-Stuart (1782-1863) family letters. In the last group mentioned is some material on the war of 1812. Miscellaneous letters and documents include items by Wade Hampton, Thomas Jefferson, Bishop Richard Channing Moore, John Randolph of Roanoke, and George Washington. The literary manuscripts, some published, some unpublished, include writings of the following: H. C. Alexander, George W. Bagby, John D. Blair, James Barron Hope, J. B. Jeter, Dabney H. Maury, and John B. Tabb. In Tidewater Virginia there are, in addition to the important collections at the College of William and Mary, several significant groups of material. Two special libraries are rapidly gathering and making accessible for research use transcripts or film copies of rather widely scattered material. The Library of Colonial Williamsburg, Incorporated, has, indexed by subject and name, transcripts of all York County records dealing with Williamsburg, and more than a score of volumes of typed transcripts of miscellaneous source material concerning the buildings at Williamsburg. At the Yorktown headquarters of the Colonial National Historical Park efforts are being made to collect film copies of source material on the Revolutionary War in the South. This quest, started in 1936 and commencing with Yorktown, already consists of approximately 50,000 sheets of enlarged films. The collection at Yorktown also contains copies of domestic material on the earlier history of the region included in this National Park. Further along the James River are three other collections. At the Coast Artillery School are preserved the official archives both of the Artillery School and of Fort Monroe, covering the years from 1824 to 1906. In its collection relating to the Negro, the library at Hampton Institute includes a group of manuscript records of slave inventories and of slave sales. Accessible in the Mariners' Museum are about 1,500 manuscripts of naval matters, ranging from logbooks, ships' account books, and ship papers, signed by the Presidents from Washington to Hayes, to Mark Twain's pilot license (12 April 1859) permitting him to act as pilot on the Mississippi River. South of Richmond at Petersburg, the Public Library contains the letters of H. D. Bird, a railway engineer, covering the years 1832-75; the Bolling family papers (1795-1880); the Nimmo notes, these being ten volumes of gleanings from various county records (many of the originals having meantime disappeared); the minutes of the Petersburg Board of Health for the years 1821-32; and sundry military records of various encampments during 1814 and 1815. Among the manuscript collections in Piedmont Virginia, in addition to the material at the University of Virginia, are those at the Packard-Laird Memorial Library of the Episcopal Theological Seminary near Alexandria, at the Library of Hampden-Sydney College at Hampden-Sydney, and at the Library of the Randolph-Macon Woman's College in Lynchburg. The Virginia Theological Seminary possesses thirty-six volumes of manuscripts and about 500 pieces, including three volumes of miscellaneous autographs of famous Episcopal churchmen, approximately 100 manuscript essays submitted by candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Divinity, and class minutes and minutes of various church organizations. This library also contains sundry clay tablets from Ninevah, dating from the ninth century, B.C. Religious records are also to be found in the Hampden-Sydney Library. These comprise approximately 5,000 pieces of manuscript material including various record books of the Presbyterian Church and of the College, and eighty-three volumes of minutes and of other accounts of the activities of the local literary society. At the Randolph-Macon Woman's College there is an interesting example of specialization in collection, its significant manuscript holdings consisting of material relating to John Randolph. These comprise an original manuscript and forty-six letters from Randolph to St. George Tucker, his step-father, written between 1795 and 1810. In the Valley section of the State there are at least five collections which deserve mention. The bibliography at Washington and Lee University has already been referred to. In this Library also are the papers of William Fleming (1729-95) comprising about 460 pieces, both personal and official. The personal papers include letters, deeds and other papers relating to land, and the diary of Colonel Fleming for the years from 1782 to 1790. The public papers consist chiefly of miscellaneous letters, reports, and commissions. There is also the journal of the first Kentucky convention (27 December 1784 to 5 January 1785). At the Roanoke Public Library there is a small but notable collection of illuminated European manuscripts and, in addition, several Arabic and Persian manuscripts. This collection dates chiefly in the fifteenth century, but the sixteenth, seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries are also represented. Also in Roanoke is the Transportation Library of the Norfolk and Western Railway, in which are preserved various early manuscript records and reports significant for the railway history of Virginia and of the South. The Holston Conference records of the Southern Methodist Church have been preserved and are accessible in the Library of Emory and Henry College. At Big Laurel in southwest Virginia is a semi-private genealogical collection known as the James Taylor Adams Library. This includes about 10,000 letters containing data on the various branches of the Adams family, and half that number on other families, mostly of Virginia and Kentucky. There is also a considerable collection of notes and manuscripts on the pioneer families of Wise County, in which Big Laurel is located. These letters are not indexed. Section G. Newspapers. The Virginia libraries contain several fair collections of earlier Virginia newspapers, scattering files from other sections of the eastern United States, and a few foreign newspapers. Through a plan devised by Dr. Lestor J. Cappon, University of Virginia Archivist, responsibility has been assumed by a considerable number of libraries for the preservation of current local papers. Other libraries have been deterred from adopting this policy of cooperation only by lack of space for the storage of bulky newspaper files. Doctor Cappon's `Virginia Newspapers, 1821-1935', which was published by the Appleton-Century Company in 1936, serves both as a bibliography and as a record of holdings, not only by Virginia but also by other American libraries. Details concerning Virginia newspapers appearing within the limits covered by his volume will therefore be, for the most part, omitted from this survey report. The most extensive collection of bound volumes of newspapers â 4,400 â is at the Virginia State Library; and this Library is currently receiving and preserving forty-one titles. The largest number of the papers which appear in this collection are Virginia publications; but the other localities represented include Alabama, Connecticut, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Washington, D.C., West Virginia, England, France, and Germany. Among the earlier runs, several being incomplete, are [Annapolis] Maryland Gazette, 1728-54; [Boston] Columbian Sentinel, 1797-98; [Edenton] State Gazette of North Carolina, 178790; [Hartford, Connecticut] American Mercury, 1788-95; [Hartford] Connecticut Courant, 1793-96; Bache's Philadelphia Aurora, 1799; [Philadelphia] County Porcupine, 1798; Philadelphia Gazette, 179597; [Philadelphia] General Advertiser, 1799; [Philadelphia] Universal Gazette, 1798-1800; [Richmond] Daily Compiler, 1816-46; [Richmond] Enquirer, 1804-77; [Richmond] Examiner, 1799-1804; [Richmond] Virginia Argus, 1797-1816; [Richmond] Virginia Gazette, 1780-1809; [Richmond] Virginia Independent Chronicle, 1786-89; [Richmond] Virginia Patriot, 1809-21; [Washington] National Intelligencer, 1800-59; and the [Williamsburg] Virginia Gazette (original and photostat copies), 1736-80. The files of foreign newspapers at the State Library include [London] Bell's Life in London, 1851-1861; [London] Times, 185760, 1914-19; [Paris] Le Charivari, 1847-52; [Paris] Le Corsair, 1849-52; [Paris] Calignani's Messenger, 1846-54; [Paris] La Gazette de France, 1849-54; [Paris] Le Moniteur Universal, 17891864; and four volumes of miscellaneous French newspapers for 1848-50. In other libraries in the State the files of newspapers dating earlier than 1820 mainly duplicate the holdings at the State Library. For example, William and Mary and the University of Virginia both have the photostat sets of the Virginia Gazette (dating from 1736), and the University of Virginia has a run of Le Moniteur Universel covering the years 1789-1849, 1856, 1871-75. At the College of William and Mary there are files of the [Richmond] Virginia Argus, 1802-12, and of the [Richmond] Enquirer, 1812-13; and there are volumes 21-40 of the [Boston] Columbian Sentinel, 1794-1804. This library has 249 bound volumes of newspapers. The University of Virginia Library has scattered issues of foreign papers from England, France, India, Japan, Mexico, Peru, Santo Domingo, and South Africa, and longer runs of the [Sofia, Bulgaria] La Bulgarie, 1925-36, [Leeds, England] Leeds Mercury, 1883-93, and [London] The Times, 1890-94, 1918-19. This collection contains 1450 bound volumes, and a rather large number of unbound volumes, and is currently receiving and preserving fifty-two newspapers. The Virginia Historical Society has 250 bound volumes which include the [Richmond] Virginia Argus, 1804-16, and the [Richmond] Virginia Patriot, 1809-10. The Library at Hampton Institute is preserving files of three negro papers, the [Newport News] Star, the [Norfolk] Journal and Guide, and the [Richmond] Planet. At the Randolph-Macon Woman's College there are 326 bound volumes, including files of the Lynchburg News, the New York Times, and the foreign Le Matin and La Prensa. Sweet Briar College has an early run of Niles' Weekly Register (1811-49) and subscribes to the Manchester Guardian. The library at Washington and Lee University contains early issues of the [Alexandria] Columbian Mirror and Alexandria Gazette and of the Lexington News Letter, 1819-30. The Petersburg Public Library, which at its foundation fell heir to the library which had belonged to the Petersburg Mechanics Association, has 302 bound volumes of old newspapers, mostly of southside Virginia. At the Jones Memorial Library in Lynchburg there is a file of local newspapers beginning in 1814; at the Norfolk Public Library a local file dates from 1802; and the Public Library at Roanoke has files of Roanoke, Floyd, and Salem newspapers running back towards the period of the War between the States. Section H. General Periodicals and Society Publications. Figures for GENERAL PERIODICALS are liable to be misleading, due to differences in interpretation and methods of handling. This being understood, we give the following totals for the dozen Virginia libraries which seem, from statistics reported by the respective librarians, to have the largest number:- University of Virginia, 14,152; Randolph-Macon Woman's College, 6,490; Randolph-Macon College, 5,180; State Library, 5,000; University of Richmond, 5,000; Richmond Public Library, 3,800; Virginia Polytechnic Institute, 3,112; Washington and Lee, 3,000; William and Mary, 2,710; Sweet Briar, 2,703; Virginia Military Institute, 2,602; Petersburg Public Library, 2,249.

Section I. Directories. A number of libraries, especially public libraries, have files of local city directories. Richmond directories, for example, have been collected by the Richmond Public Library, the State Library, the University of Richmond, and the Virginia Historcal Society. The Roanoke Public Library and the Virginia Historical Society also contain scattering examples of other city directories as well as the local publications. At the State Library there are Richmond directories from 1850 to date, the Virginia Directory from 1852 to 1917, and incomplete files for Danville, Lynchburg, Norfolk, Petersburg, and Roanoke; among places outside of Virginia this library has runs for the District of Columbia and for Newark, New Jersey, with scattered volumes from other localities. This collection contains approximately 500 volumes. There is a heterogeneous collection of city, county, state, and more specialized directories at the University of Virginia. The General Library has various city directories, college and fraternity directories, and directories covering various professions. The Medical Library has the American Medical Directory, Polk's Medical Register, and various state directories. The Bureau of Public Administration Library has an almost complete collection of state directories, with a scattering of county directories; its collection of directories of agencies engaged in public administration in the United States is large, and its foreign directories covering the same field is representative. Section J. Illustrations. Among the libraries in Virginia there is a considerable number of interesting collections of pictures, slides, films, and other illustrative matter. Examples may be mentioned for ten or a dozen libraries, naming them alphabetically. At the Coast Artillery School there are approximately 3,500 negatives on Fort Monroe history and on general military subjects, and approximately 8,000 slides on military subjects. Hampton Institute has 1,691 pictures in the Carnegie art collection, twenty volumes and twenty portfolios of the Curtis collection on the North American Indian, and 274 photographs of various examples of Negro art. At the Mariners' Museum there is a miscellaneous collection of small prints and engravings numbering 2,976 items; and of photographs there is a collection of no less than 15,380 items. These two collections include sailing vessels, naval engagements, ports and harbors, bridges, lighthouses, portraits, and marine paintings. Old Petersburg is recorded in a small collection of pictures at the Petersburg Public Library, the main emphasis being on details of early houses of historical or architectural interest. At the Roanoke Public Library there is a file of mounted pictures (2,655 items in all) arranged by artist or subject. The State Teachers College Library at East Radford also has a picture collection of 2,271 items - 414 mounted, 1110 unmounted, and 747 slides. Three of the libraries at the University of Virginia contain collections of illustrative matter. The Medical Library has extensive sets of microscopic slides, of slides on the subject of skin diseases, and of anatomical slides of the stereopticon type prepared by Edinburgh University. The Fine Arts Library has on file general collections on art and a special collection of photographs of old houses in Virginia. At the Extension Library there are available 309 films on general historical subjects, on world war history, and on miscellaneous subjects, 135 colour prints illustrating various schools of painting, and 620 slides on such subjects as American history, nursing education, and the University of Virginia. In the Library of the Virginia Historical Society there are twenty-one files and various unfiled pictures of personages, events, houses, and scenes of historical interest. These are indexed. The State Library contains a printed picture collection (both flat and vertically filed) of approximately 2,500 items, 1,500 being portraits and the rest largely historical scenes. There are about fifty large oil paintings in the possession of the State Library, some of considerable value; and in the J. G. and C. W. Chapman collection there are about 500 or more small oil paintings. A set of the Carnegie collection of prints is located at the Library of Washington and Lee University. The Library of the College of William and Mary possesses an extensive and celebrated collection of portraits; it has also approximately 3,000 engravings dating from 1780 to the present. Section K. Ephemerae. Virginia libraries are quite normal in having a large amount of pamphlet material and in being baffled by the problem of securing at the same time both adequate and inexpensive handling. At the University of Virginia Library a staff committee of five members has recently reviewed the whole subject and has courage ously proposed a method aiming at preservation, accessibility, and economy. This method is being given a thorough trial with an extensive general collection as its material. The University Library also has large special collections in biology, classics, forestry, medicine, optics, public administration, and rural social economics. Other important pamphlet collections are located at the libraries of Sweet Briar College, the College of William and Mary, the State Teachers College at East Radford, and at Hampton Institute. The largest special collection is probably at the Union Theological Seminary in Richmond. This has been accumulating for 130 years, numbers approximately 20,000 items, and the initial steps in the work of organization as undertaken by the present Librarian indicate that some of its items are excessively rare and that the collection as a whole probably will constitute one of the most valuable and significant resources of that library. Among the libraries which have files of clippings are Hampton Institute (587 books, on the Negro), Petersburg Public, Randolph-Macon Woman's College (on the College), Roanoke Public (on Roanoke and Virginia), University of Virginia, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the State Library (4,000 pieces on 3,000 subjects), and William and Mary (on Williamsburg and the College). The collector's instinct seems to thrive among librarians, the genus Ephemerae revealing sundry interesting examples. Of course the World War inspired many collections of world war printed materials. In Virginia the University of Richmond, the State Teachers College at Harrisonburg, the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and the State Library have such collections. The sets of war posters are perhaps the most important. Various programmes are preserved at Randolph-Macon Woman's College, the State Library, William and Mary, and the University of Virginia; and there are collections of bookplates at the Roanoke Public Library, at the College of William and Mary, and the State Library. The College of William and Mary has a file of about 2,000 legal briefs. This library also has a collection of charts. A variety of nautical charts and a collection of plans and lines of vessels may be found at the Mariners' Museum; and at the Public Administration Library at the University of Virginia there is a considerable number of charts, maps, and graphs covering the public administration field, local, national, and foreign. The State Library has an interesting group of representative ballots; it has also gathered stamps, autographs, and currency, the last item including Virginia and American colonial currency and a considerable number of Civil War and Confederate specimens.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PART TWO â SPECIAL SUBJECTS I. HUMANITIES Section A. General Humanities. In addition to the sets listed in the section on general periodicals and society publications,* * Pages 17-18. the University of Virginia Library contains the Altnordische Sagabibliothek, the Handbuch der Literaturwissenschaft, Notes and Queries, and the speech atlases of Germany and Italy and Southern Switzerland; Arkiv fÃ¼r Nordisk Filologi, Acta Philologica Scandinavica, American Journal of Philology, American Philological Association Transactions and Proceedings, Archiv fÃ¼r das Studium der Neueren Sprachen und Literaturen, Indogermanische Forschungen, Journal of English and Germanic Philology, Language, Le MaÃ®tre Phonetique, Modern Language Review, Modern Philology, Palaestra, Philologische Wochenschrift, Publications of the Modern Language Association, Revue de LittÃ©rature ComparÃ©e, and Studies in Philology. Several of these are duplicated in other university or college libraries, notably at the College of William and Mary, Hollins, Randolph-Macon, Randolph-Macon Woman's College, the State Teachers Colleges at East Radford and Farmville, Sweet Briar, University of Richmond, Virginia Military Institute, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and Washington and Lee. The student in paleography would find some material at the libraries of the Episcopal Theological Seminary in Alexandria and of the Union Theological Seminary in Richmond. Attention has been given to this subject at two of the women's colleges also: Randolph-Macon Woman's College and Sweet Briar. At the University of Virginia there is moderate opportunity for work in classics on epigraphy and in English on facsimiles of Chaucer manuscripts and on Elizabethan handwriting. Section B. Language and Literature. In CLASSICAL LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES the University of Virginia Library has 9,164 volumes and a pamphlet collection of about equal extent. The majority of the standard periodicals are subscribed to; namely, Classical Journal, Classical Philology, Classical Quarterly, Classical Review, Classical Weekly, Hermes, Hesperia, Jahresbericht Ã¼ber die Fortschritte der Klassischen Altertumswissenschaft, Journal of Hellenic Studies, Revue des Ãtudes Grecques, Revue des Ãtudes Latines, and Romania. There are also such sets as the Inscriptiones Latinae, the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae, the Loeb Classical Library, and its French counterpart, the Collection des UniversitÃ©s de France. The Washington and Lee Library has an excellent general collection of classical literature numbering about 3,300 volumes and notable for collected and critical works. Smaller but live collections of the `dead' languages are at William and Mary, Randolph-Macon Woman's College, Sweet Briar, and the University of Richmond. It is an interesting fact that the classical works in the State Library apparently form the third largest collection in the libraries of the State. It is also interesting to note how many available library sets there are of Loeb's Classical Library. What emphasis there is in the collections of AMERICAN LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE is on the South. The set of books which one can most confidently count on finding is the Library of Southern Literature; and many collections contain runs of the Southern Literary Messenger. The University of Richmond Library affords a fairly typical example in that it is definitely collecting the works of John Esten Cooke, Marion Harland, Mary Johnston, Thomas Nelson Page, AmÃ©lie Rives, and Paul Laurence Dunbar, J. P. Kennedy, William Gilmore Simms, and similar regional authors. The achievements of the State Library in such quests are indicated in Dr. Earl G. Swem's invaluable guide, A Bibliography of Virginia.* * Swem, Earl G. A Bibliography of Virginia ... Richmond, Bottom, 1916-17. Two volumes. (In Virginia. State Library. Bulletin: VIII, 2-4; X, 1-4). Part one. Titles of books in the Virginia State Library which relate to Virginia and Virginians; titles of books written by Virginians and of those printed in Virginia; with index. The collections at the State Library, at William and Mary, and at the University of Virginia are likely to gladden research seekers with obscure works of minor authors. Another local collecting activity that is not uncommon is illustrated by the material on Southern folk-songs at Sweet Briar College. Apart from this natural emphasis, the collections of American language and literature tend to be general and standard. Many of the larger public and college libraries have the Dictionary of American English; the Cambridge History of American Literature, Duyckinck's Cyclopaedia of American Literature, and Stedman and Hutchinson's Library of American Literature; the works of Charles Brockden Brown, James Fenimore Cooper, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Eugene Field, Benjamin Franklin, Bret Harte, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Washington Irving, Mark Twain, and Henry D. Thoreau - to choose ten of the most popular names. The largest collection, that at the University of Virginia, numbered 8,079 when the count was made for this survey. Other fairly extensive collections are at the State Library, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Randolph-Macon Woman's College, the College of William and Mary, and Randolph-Macon College. The examination of the material on ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND LITERATURE in Virginia has resulted in no unexpected or startling conclusions. There are a score of good collections available for the general reader, and six or eight with at least some material on the research level. Of course size of collections may mean little for research purposes, except in so far as it indicates the presence of the foundation materials. But as reported, the largest collections, omitting public libraries, are as follows: University of Virginia, 13,429 volumes; Sweet Briar, 6,703 volumes; Randolph-Macon Woman's College, 4,633 volumes; State Library, approximately 3,800 or 4,000 volumes; William and Mary, about 3,500 volumes; Hampton Institute, 3,465 volumes; Virginia Polytechnic Institute, 3,017 volumes, University of Richmond, about 3,000 volumes. A different approach to an estimate of the research value of the collections may be obtained by consideration of the holdings of certain representative titles. To publish the results of such a test is, of course, highly dangerous when, as in this case, the findings were obtained rather casually. But with a caveat as to undoubted inaccuracies, the results (which once more demonstrate the scattered condition of research materials in Virginia) may be indicated as follows:- Anglia. At University of Virginia. Anglistische Forschungen. At University of Virginia (incomplete set) Cambridge History of English Literature. At College of William and Mary, Hollins College, Petersburg Public Library, Randolph-Macon Woman's College, Richmond Public Library, State Teachers Colleges at Farmville and Fredericksburg, Sweet Briar, University of Richmond, University of Virginia, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and Virginia State Library. Camden Society. At Randolph-Macon Woman's College, University of Virginia, Virginia State Library. Chaucer Society. At University of Virginia, Virginia State Library. Deutsche Shakespeare Gesellschaft Jahrbuch. At University of Virginia. Early English Text Society. At College of William and Mary, Hollins, Randolph-Macon Woman's College, University of Richmond, University of Virginia. Englische Studien. At University of Virginia. English Dialect Society. At University of Virginia. English Journal. At Hampton Institute, Randolph-Macon Woman's College, Richmond Public Library, State Teachers College at Farmville, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, University of Virginia. Facsimile Text Society. At Sweet Briar, University of Virginia. Grosart's Reprints. At University of Virginia. Harleian Miscellany. At Union Theological Seminary, University of Virginia, Virginia State Library. Review of English Studies. At College of William and Mary, Hollins, Sweet Briar, University of Virginia. Scottish Text Society. At University of Virginia. Shakespeare Society Publications. At College of William and Mary, Randolph-Macon, Sweet Briar, University of Richmond, University of Virginia, Virginia State Library. Studien zur Englischen Philologie. At University of Virginia. These location records are for large holdings, though not necessarily complete ones. Furthermore, frankness demands the admission that for several titles on this test list (Malone Society and Spenser Society for example) there seemed to be no holdings whatever in these libraries. A note or two should be added to this consideration of English language and literature collections in Virginia. At the Alexandria Public Library, which has inherited books which belonged to the old Alexandria Library and Free Reading Room founded in 1794, there is a small group of English and American volumes dating from the beginning of the nineteenth century. At the College of William and Mary some emphasis has been laid on the assemblage of critical material of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. At Sweet Briar there is an outstanding collection of material on George Meredith. Blake and Leigh Hunt are subjects of attention at the University of Richmond. At Washington and Lee University there are two collections of standard works in English and sundry interesting eighteenth century items in the Franklin Society Library. The University of Virginia is a subscriber to the film collection of books printed in English prior to 1550. The collections in Virginia of books in GERMANIC LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES are chiefly of a scope for undergraduate instruction in colleges. In several of the libraries, however, systematic plans are in operation for increase in sets of standard authors, in critical works, and in appropriate periodicals. The most extensive collections seem to be at the Randolph-Macon Woman's College and at the University of Virginia, both of these totaling slightly under 3,000 volumes. Other good working collections are at the Virginia Military Institute, Sweet Briar, and William and Mary. At the Randolph-Macon Woman's College there are complete sets of the works of Auerbach, BÃ¶rne, Chamisso, Feuerbach, Fontane, GÃ¶rres, Goethe, Grillparzer, Gutzkow, Hauptmann, Hauff, Heyse, Hoffmann, Keller, Klinger, Laube, Lenz, Lessing, Liliencron, Ludwig, MÃ¶rike, Nietzsche, Schiller, Scheffel, Seidel, Stifter, Storm, Sudermann, Tieck, Vernhagen von Ense, Wagner, Wedekind, and Wieland. The University of Virginia Library, in addition to sets previously listed,* * Page 22. contains the Codex Wormianus of the Prose Edda, the Codex of the FlateyjahrbÃ²k, LÃ¼dike and Mackensen's Deutscher Kulturatlas, the Sammlung Kurzer Grammatiken Deutscher Mundarten, and Wilhelm's Corpus der Altdeutschen Originalurkunden; also the BeitrÃ¤ge zur Geschichte der Deutschen Sprache und Literatur, Jahrbuch and Schriften der Goethe Gesellschaft, Neue Rundschau, WÃ¶rter und Sachen, Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Deutsche Mundarten, Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Deutsche Philologie, and Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Deutsches Altertum. The general statement made with respect to the Germanic field can be repeated for ROMANIC LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES; namely, that the present collections in Virginia are mainly suitable for undergraduate instruction. But there is promise that several of the collections will, in the not distant future, afford attractive opportunity for research. The most obvious deficiency seems to be in the periodical and society publications. The brief and rather staccato notes which follow include only the largest collections in the various languages. It will be noted that the women's colleges are well and favourably represented. In FRENCH the Randolph-Macon Woman's College has 2,469 volumes, with emphasis on the so-called classical writers. The collection contains a goodly number of sets of complete works, some historical and critical material, and such works on the language as Brunot's Histoire de la Langue Francaise des Origines Ã  1900, Nyrop's Grammaire Historique de la Langue Francaise, and Plattner's AusfÃ¼hrliche Grammatik der Franzosischen Sprache. The Mary Helen Cochran Library at Sweet Briar College has 2,192 volumes in French. The emphasis follows the curriculum courses and is mainly on the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries; but material on the French theatre has been assembled from the origins to the present. There are some notable items on the bibliography and on the history of the literature. The collection of French books at the College of William and Mary numbers about 1,850 volumes. The greatest stress has been laid on the classical period and on types of literature; and there are approximately 150 volumes of critical works. The library which serves both the University of Richmond and Westhampton College has a well chosen collection of the works of the principal French writers, with some emphasis on the modern French drama. At the University of Virginia there are 1,611 volumes in the French collection. A start has been made in the acquisition of material on linguistics and of periodicals; and there may be found such works as Godefroy's Dictionnaire de l'Ancienne Langue Francaise, Meyer-LÃ¼bke's Grammatik der Romanischen Sprachen, and the collections of the Classiques Francais de Moyen Ãge and of the SociÃ©tÃ© des Anciens Textes Francais. The library at Washington and Lee University also contains a set of the SociÃ©tÃ© des Anciens Textes Francais and a good collection of standard authors. There are approximately 1,500 French works in this library. The Walter Hines Page Library at Randolph-Macon College has been enriched by the John Marvin Burton Collection of Romance Languages and Literatures, the French section including general and critical works numbering 1,013. In ITALIAN the University of Virginia Library has 923 volumes. The periodicals include the Archivio Glottolozico Italiano and the Giornale Storico della Letteratura Italiana, and there are sets of the Scrittori d'Italia and the Storia Letteraria d'Italia. Some special attention has been given to the assemblage of editions and criticisms of Dante. At Sweet Briar College the collection in Italian numbers 432 volumes. It is well adapted to the present needs of undergraduate work, the main emphasis being on `the golden age' and the nineteenth century. Similar statements can be made concerning the collection of 250 Italian volumes at the College of William and Mary and the collection of 243 volumes at Randolph-Macon Woman's College. Of SPANISH books the University of Virginia has 2,140 volumes. The periodicals include the Bulletin Hispanique, the Bulletin of Spanish Studies, Hispania, the Revista de Filologia EspaÃ±ola, and the Revue Hispanique; there are several general sets, such as the Biblioteca de Autores EspaÃ±oles, the Clasicos Castel lanos, and the Grandes Escritores Argentinos; and sundry historical and critical writings, as for example the Historia de la Lengua y Literatura Castellana by Cajador y Franca and Roxlo's Historia Critica de la Literatura Uruguaya. Emphasis has to some degree been centered on Cervantes. At the College of William and Mary there are approximately 800 volumes of Spanish. These include files of Hispania and of the Revue Hispanique and such important sets as Nueva Bibliotheca de Autores EspaÃ±oles and Poetas Liricos Castellanos. Smaller collections, chosen chiefly for undergraduate studies, are located at Sweet Briar College, at Virginia Military Institute, at the University of Richmond, and at Randolph-Macon Woman's College. There is a file of the Bulletin of Hispanic Studies at Sweet Briar College. Sweet Briar and the Randolph-Macon Woman's College subscribe to Hispania. Sets of the Bibliotheca de Autores EspaÃ±oles are at Virginia Military Institute and at the University of Richmond; and of the Clasicos Castellanos at Virginia Military Institute and Randolph-Macon Woman's College. Material in OTHER LANGUAGES AND LITERATURES is scattered and small in amount with the exception of the collections of Semitic and related languages at the Union Theological Seminary in Richmond and at the Episcopal Theological Seminary in Alexandria. Some mention of this will be made in Section E, Religion. In FOLKLORE the University of Virginia Library has 386 volumes, which include runs of Folklore (London Folklore Society), Folklore Society Publications, Journal of American Folklore, and Transactions of the Folklore Society. Folklore of the South, particularly of Virginia, and Negro folklore are emphasized. This collection has been assembled in part to supplement the activities of the Virginia Folklore Society and of Prof. A. K. Davis, Jr., author of `Traditional Ballads of Virginia.' The collection of American, English, and Scottish ballads is fairly good. Negro folklore and negro folk-songs are emphasized at the Collis P. Huntington Memorial Library of Hampton Institute. This collection contains about 200 volumes. Four other institutional collections of folklore material may be mentioned for Virginia, each numbering from 150 to 200 volumes. At the Richmond Public Library and at the State Teachers College in Farmville special attention has been given to ballads; at the University of Richmond the emphasis is on negro folklore; and at the College of William and Mary the collection is general in interest. Section C. Fine Arts. On the general subject of the history of fine arts the libraries at the College of William and Mary and at the University of Virginia have about 300 volumes each. The College of William and Mary receives the following general art periodicals: American Magazine of Art, Antiquarian, Antiquity, Apollo, Art and Archaeology, Art Bulletin, Art Digest, Art in America, Arts and Decoration, Connoisseur, Deutsche Kunst und Decoration, Gazette des Beaux-Arts, Industrial Arts Magazine, London Studio, Parnassus, and School Arts Magazine. Somewhat similar lists of periodicals are recorded by Hollins College, the Richmond Public Library, Sweet Briar, the State Teachers College at Farmville, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the University of Virginia, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, and the Virginia State Library. Carnegie collections on fine arts have been located at Hampton Institute, Hollins College, Randolph-Macon Woman's College, Sweet Briar, University of Virginia, Washington and Lee, William and Mary, and probably at other institutional libraries. Of the publications of art galleries and institutions and museums the University of Virginia currently receives the following bulletins:- Beaux Art Institute of Design, Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Allied Architects of Los Angeles, Minneapolis Museum of Art, Metropolitan Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design, Washington County Museum of Fine Arts, and Worcester Art Museum. Similar groups of publications of this character can be found at the Norfolk Public Library, the Richmond Public Library, the State Library, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, and William and Mary. The Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond is developing an important reference collection which is available to the museum staff, the museum membership, and to duly accredited art research workers. This at present contains approximately 2,000 volumes. The collection embraces both decorative and fine arts. Certain collections of prints, slides, and photographs have already been recorded under Part One, Section J, Illustrations.* * Pages 19-20. The notes which follow supplement but do not duplicate that record. Collections of prints are accessible at the College of William and Mary, at Sweet Briar, at the State Teachers College at Harrisonburg, and at Washington and Lee University. As slides are usually a part of the teaching materials of the Carnegie sets, they are likely to be accessible at the libraries which are so fortunate as to possess these sets. In addition, the library at Randolph-Macon College owns 715 slides, chiefly of classical architecture. Sweet Briar has approximately 2,000 slides on various art subjects. Hampton Institute has a collection of 15,000 mounted pictures for lending purposes. The Norfolk Public Library also has an extensive loan collection of pictures and photographs. At Roanoke College, in Salem, the Davis F. Bittle Memorial Library possesses 7,000 pictures illustrative of art through the ages. And at the Union Theological Seminary there is a steadily growing collection of photographs of Christian art and symbolism. The decades of severe depression following the War between the States tended to eliminate the study and practice of MUSIC from the primary and secondary school systems, and thereby retarded emphasis in college curricula and in library collections. At present, however, there are a number of collections in musicology of fair size scattered through Virginia; several interesting special subjects are being emphasized; and the Carnegie collections and the Foster Hall reproductions of the songs of Stephen Foster have evidently been eagerly welcomed. Brief notes concerning a dozen or so of the larger collections in the State are given herewith. The material on music at the University of Virginia consists of well over 500 volumes of musicology in the general library and of 23,103 volumes and pieces in a special music library, a total of approximately 23,600 items. The section in the general library includes biography, history, theory and technique, and works on musical instruments; and there are files of thirteen serials. The section in the special music library is composed of the following groups:- Bound Unbound Total Books about music 21 63 84 Full orchestral and ensemble scores 20 269 289 Orchestral parts, without scores 156 156 Ensemble 21 274 295 Piano music 95 1,528 1,623 Vocal music 134 18,639 18,773 Grand opera 73 88 161 Light opera 19 41 60 Flute music 3 3 Organ music 27 27 Violin music 12 12 Phonograph records (discs) 1,164 Boston Symphony Orchestra programmes 380 380 Periodicals 2 49 51 Total in special library 388 21,551 23,103 The library at Hampton Institute contains 1,146 volumes and pieces on music, including the Carnegie and Stephen Foster collections and several periodicals. As is fitting for an Institute so widely and favourably known for its singers, the emphasis is on negro music and the work of negro composers. At the Mary Helen Cochran Library at Sweet Briar College there are 1,005 volumes and pieces of music. These include the standard biographies, histories of music, and texts on theory, and the standard collections. Of special interest are the first set of madrigals composed by Orlando Gibbons, the first set of madrigals composed by John Wilbye, fifty compositions of Dufay and his contemporaries ranging from A.D. 1400 to 1440, and such works as Beck's Les Chansonniers des Troubadours et des TrouvÃ¨res and Arnold Schering's Geschichte der Musik in Beispielen. The Cocke Memorial Library at Hollins College subscribes to several periodicals in music, and it has the Carnegie collection with an extensive assortment of phonograph records. There are sixty-seven volumes on theory and technique, 140 volumes of biographies of musicians, and forty volumes on the history of music. The collection contains altogether 639 volumes. In the library at the Randolph-Macon Woman's College there are 434 volumes and pieces, including dictionaries and encyclopaedias and runs of five periodicals. The library at the University of Richmond has a total of 736 volumes and pieces on music. Of these 112 volumes on musicology are in the main library and seventy-nine volumes on musicology are in the Margaret James Memorial Room. In the latter special collection there are the following musical scores: Organ 39 pieces Piano 235 pieces Violin 2 volumes Vocal 45 pieces Exercise and teaching books 25 volumes Galbraith organ collection 110 pieces Watson collection 89 pieces At the College of William and Mary there is a collection of about 3,000 scores in the custody of the Music Department. The library itself has a good collection on musicology, twenty-six volumes of song scores and spirituals, and an interesting old collection of fifty bound volumes of English and American scores dated before 1820. Let who will make either the laws or the songs of the State, the Virginia State Library has proved its readiness to collect both. It contains a good selection of works on musicology and has files of several music serials, the total number of volumes and pieces being about 850. There are also fifty pieces of Virginia music, and approximately 100 pieces of Confederate music. Many of the public libraries contain a useful selection of books on musicology. Somewhat specially notable in this respect are the public libraries in Richmond, in Petersburg, and in Hopewell. Both the Packard-Laird Memorial Library of the Virginia Episcopal Theological Seminary and the Spence Library of the Union Theological Seminary have made very good beginnings on collections of hymnology. Of general materials on the THEATRE the State Library has about 300 volumes, these being scattered through the various topics in this field. Of somewhat special note are a group of the monumental works on costume, a good selection of the histories of the theatre and of the stage, and a collection of early Virginia playbills. The University of Virginia Library contains approximately 200 volumes on this subject, with some emphasis on the history of the stage, on costume, and on scenery, stage decoration, and lighting. In addition there is an extension drama collection which numbers well over 10,000 printed copies of plays, mostly modern. In the library at the State Teachers College at Farmville there are 152 volumes on theatre history, technique, costume, dancing, pageantry, and allied subjects which have been so admirably chosen as to make this well nigh a model collection of its size. At Hollins College, Randolph-Macon Woman's College, Sweet Briar, and William and Mary there are also collections on the theatre which are well selected both for present curriculum use and also as foundations for possible future expansion. Of material on ARCHITECTURE the University of Virginia Fine Arts Library contains 1250 volumes. The attempt has been made to cover the general field. The works on the history of architecture are considerable in number, and there is some stress on the more modern periods, particularly the Renaissance. Current numbers of the following periodicals are received: American Architect and Architecture, American Builder and Building Age, American Home, Architectural Concrete, Architectural Forum, Architectural Record, Architectural Review, Architecture, L'Architecture d'aujourd'hui, California Arts and Architecture, House Beautiful, Journal of the Royal Institute of British Architects, Landscape Architecture, Moderne Bauformen, and Pencil Points. At the library of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg there are about 600 volumes on architecture. This collection includes fifty-five volumes on the history of architecture and a dozen or more current periodicals. Emphasis has been placed on architectural engineering. About 500 volumes on architecture are to be found at the Virginia State Library. This collection contains runs of a number of periodicals, and offers material for study of types of architecture. The period most stressed is that of colonial days in America. At the library of Hampton Institute there are over 400 volumes on this subject and sets of Architectural Forum, Architectural Record, Architecture and Building, and House Beautiful. The emphasis is on residences and public buildings. In PAINTING AND SCULPTURE combined there are a few more than 1,000 volumes at the University of Virginia Library. In sculpture (584 volumes) the Greek and Roman phases of the ancient period are stressed; in painting (422 volumes) the division is by schools, the English, Italian, and Spanish predominating. But these collections are well balanced, and the works have been selected with care. The State Library has 300 volumes on painting and seventy-five on sculpture. The material covers the whole field but the emphasis is on American artists. At Hampton Institute the library collection includes 334 volumes on painting and twenty-eight on sculpture. The number of works on individual painters is comparatively large. Sweet Briar College has 356 volumes on these two subjects combined. This collection is strong in historical works. Material on OTHER FINE ARTS is not extensive in amount and is scattered through the State. For example there are fair collections on drawing and handicrafts at Hampton Institute; on interior decoration at the Petersburg Public Library, at the State Teachers College at Farmville and at Fredericksburg, and at the University of Virginia; on furniture at Randolph-Macon Woman's College and at the Richmond Public Library; on landscape gardening at the Farmville State Teachers College, at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and at the University of Virginia; on engraving at the Roanoke Public Library and at the State Library; on photography at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the State Library, and the University of Virginia; and from the Virginia Military Institute is reported a library interest in sporting as a fine art! Section D. Philosophy. At the University of Virginia Library there are somewhat over 6,000 volumes on philosophy, the special field of interest being the philosophic systems, ethics, and logic. Esthetics is also being developed. Kant, Spinoza, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Plato, Aristotle, Bacon, Spencer are among the philosophers largely represented by works and critical commentaries. The files of periodicals include the Aristotelian Society Proceedings, Erkenntnis, Hibbert Journal, International Journal of Ethics, Journal of Philosophical Studies, Journal of Philosophy, Journal of Speculative Philosophy, Journal of Symbolic Logic, Mind, Monist, Philosophical Review, Philosophy, and Revue Philosophique. The collections in philosophy at the College of William and Mary and at the Episcopal Theological Seminary both number approximately 1,500 volumes. At William and Mary ethics is the strongest section, and the modern period is most emphasized. At the Episcopal Theological Seminary there are some valuable sets of the classical and mediaeval philosophers, with emphasis merging into the philosophy of religion. The library at the Randolph-Macon Woman's College has about 1,400 volumes in philosophy, with stress on Aristotle and other classical philosophers. Berkeley is also featured in this collection. Among the periodicals are the Hibbert Journal, International Journal of Ethics, Journal of Philosophy, Journal of Symbolic Logic, Mind, Personalist, Philosophical Review, Philosophische Studien, Philosophy, and Philosophy of Science. Washington and Lee University has about 1,000 volumes in philosophy, this being a general collection. Section E. Religion. In the field of religion there are two collections in Virginia which are outstanding for purposes of research. These are at the Spence Library of the Union Theological Seminary in Richmond and at the Packard-Laird Memorial Library of the Virginia Theological Seminary at Alexandria. The Spence Library has a total collection of about 55,000 volumes, of which at least 20,000 may be classed as specifically on the subject of religion. There is an excellent equipment of general encyclopaedias and reference sets, and adequate reference and periodical materials are available in each subdivision of the subject. The works on primitve religion include basic sets such as Creuzer's Symbolik und Mythologie der Alten VÃ¶lker, Frazer's Golden Bough, and Gray and Moore's Mythology of all Races. The non-Christian religions are represented by their sacred writings and by treatises thereon. On the history and culture of Israel there 292 volumes exclusive of archaeology, and there are thirty-one volumes on contemporary Judaism. The Talmud, Targums, Mischna, and other Rabbinical writings appear in Hebrew and also in Latin, French, and English translations. Of the Old Testament there are twenty-two editions in Hebrew, seventy-eight volumes of editions in Greek and of critical works on the Greek Old Testament, and thirty editions in English. There are 686 volumes of commentaries dealing with the Old Testament, 260 volumes dealing specifically with Old Testament criticism, and 120 volumes concerned with such related subjects as the transmission of the Bible, the canon and text of the Bible, and the Bible as literature. It is in its collection on the New Testament, however, that the Spence Library offers one of its more important fields for research; and of this section there is available a somewhat elaborate catalogue.* * Bitzer, David Rolston. Materials available in the Library of Union Theological Seminary, Richmond, Virginia, for the Study of the Text and Canon of the New Testament ... May 1933. 374 pp. (Dissertation. Typewritten.) The collection includes facsimile copies of all the major uncial manuscripts except Vaticanus or Codex B, with collations of about seventy cursive manuscripts and texts of various ostraca; copies of all the notable printed editions of the Greek New Testament with the exception of the Complutensian or 1514 Ximenes, of which the Library owns the Plantin reprint of 1584; sets of commentaries to the number of sixty and single volume commentaries on the New Testament to the number of 800; and files of such periodicals as the Harvard Theological Review, Journal of Biblical Literature, Journal of Theological Studies, and Zeitschrift fÃ¼r die Neuetestamentliche Wissenschaft. On the history of the early Christian Church the Spence Library contains about 600 volumes including such massive early sets as those by Baronius Soranus, Basnage de Flottermanville, William Cave, Eusebius Pamphilus, and James Saurin. On the Reformation there is a valuable group of seventeenth and eighteenth century treatises and approximately 250 modern works; and about fifty volumes, some early, deal with the various Councils. The material on the Church of England is small in amount (seventy-five volumes) but includes several seventeenth century titles; and a similar collection deals with the Catholic Church. Contemporary Christian Theology is represented by about 100 volumes specifically concerned with the conflict of science and religion and about 100 volumes specifically concerned with the current restatement of Christian thought; and there are sizeable collections on Systematic and Dogmatic Theology and on Practical Theology. With reference to Christianity in America there are some 400 volumes dealing with the history of denominations, and a considerable amount of material on the organization and activities of missionary societies. But the most important and significant body of research materials in this library of the Union Theological Seminary is its large collection of manuscript and printed records of the Presbyterian Church in the United States. The manuscript section has already been briefly described in Part One, Section F., Manuscripts.* * Page 12. In addition there are complete files of printed minutes and reports of various organizations, large and small, within the jurisdiction of that Church; and there are bound volumes of seventeen Presbyterian church papers and of twenty-one theological reviews and journals under Presbyterian editorship or control. This material is accessible for research purposes, and there is steady continuation in collecting activities. The Packard-Laird Memorial Library of the Virginia Theological Seminary has a total collection of approximately 32,000 volumes, of which somewhat over half are on the specific subject of religion. As in the case of the Spence Library, this special collection is located in what is in effect a general collection â a situation which of course often proves convenient for research scholars. In both of these libraries, for example, there may be found material dealing with Aramaic, Assyrian, and Chaldean languages and with Semitic languages in general. There are also the essential encyclopaedias and reference works, and good background material in history, literature, and philosophy. The Packard-Laird Library also has a special association collection of books from the Lee library (Richard Henry Lee and Thomas Ludwell Lee) at Stratford. The quality of this library may be perhaps indicated by a casual and unsystematic and of course very incomplete list of works which appear on the shelves; namely, the Apostolic Fathers, the Babylonian Talmud, the Consilia Ecclesiae, the Egypt Exploration Fund Publications, Frazer's Golden Bough, the History of the Popes, Hook's Lives of the Archbishops of Canterbury, the International Critical Commentary, the Library of Anglo-Catholic Theology (eighty-two volumes), Migne's Patrologie, the three sets of the works of the Nicene Fathers, Picart's Religious Memories of the World, the Sacred Books of the East, the works of Cocceius, Erasmus, Hieronymous, Servanus, and files of the American Biblical Repository, the American Journal of Theology, the Jahrbuch fÃ¼r Deutsche Theologie, and the Journal of Sacred Literature. By a more statistical analysis, there are in round numbers 400 volumes on non-Christian religions, 800 on the Old Testament, 700 on the New Testament, 600 on primitive Christianity, 150 on Christianity in the Roman Empire, 300 on the Reformation, 500 on the history of the Church of England, 1,000 on Christian theology, 250 on American church history, and 400 on missions. The pamphlet collection is extensive, and the large task of arrangement and filing is likely to yield material of value. Some notice concerning the manuscript holdings has already appeared in Part One, Section F., Manuscripts.* * Page 14. Other large collections of books on religion can be found at the University of Virginia (over 8,000 volumes), at the Virginia State Library (approximately 5,500 volumes), and at the College of William and Mary (between 3,000 and 3,500 volumes). All three collections are well organized, but do not include any considerable proportion of rare items. At the University of Virginia there is some emphasis on contemporary Christian theology. The State Library is well supplied with the collected works of outstanding preachers, such as Phillips Brooks, Thomas Chalmers, Myles Coverdale, Henry Drummond, John Foxe, Tyndale, John Wesley, and George Whitfield. In the extensive collection of Virginiana which the library at William and Mary possesses there are many individual church histories of Virginia. In most of the libraries which have been so frequently named in this survey report for Virginia the collections on religion are comparatively large. It is evident that credit is due to clergymen as a class for their notable generosity as donators of books. II. SOCIAL SCIENCES Section A. General Social Science. What has been found to be generally true in this survey of Virginia libraries proves to be specifically true with regard to the general classes in social science; namely, that there are a score or so of collections in which a good start has been made in the gathering of the essential materials. The keenest interest is obviously in current publications and in types associated with local problems or persons. For example, sets of the Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences are to be found at the College of William and Mary, Hampton Institute, Hollins College, Randolph-Macon College and Randolph-Macon Woman's College, Richmond Public Library, the State Teachers Colleges at Farmville and at Harrisonburg, Sweet Briar, Union Theological Seminary, University of Richmond, University of Virginia, Virginia Military Institute, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Virginia State Library, Washington and Lee University, and doubtless in a number of other libraries. Almost the same list of locations could be repeated for the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science. The collection of works of statesmen has not at all been limited to sectional boundaries. Yet the sets that are found most generally in Virginia are those of Washington, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, Woodrow Wilson, Patrick Henry, and Jefferson Davis. The simpler items of statistical material are also more commonly available. But in these libraries there are few of the important foreign publications on the subject of statistics. Section B. Anthropology and Ethnology. The largest collection in Virginia of material on anthropology and ethnology is in the State Library. This collection deals largely with the American Indian and the American Negro. The files of periodicals (some incomplete) include the American Anthropologist, the Transactions of the American Ethnology Society, the Transactions of the Anthropological Society of Washington, the Journal of Race Development, the Annual Reports and the Bulletins of the United States Bureau of American Ethnology, and the Washington University Publications on Anthropology. Altogether there are in the State Library approximately 1,000 volumes on these subjects. A somewhat smaller collection which contains a considerable amount of recent material is to be found at the University of Virginia. Another collection, convenient for the laboratory type of study, is located in a departmental library at the Virginia Military Institute. Section C. Sociology. Thanks to Francis Bacon, every schoolboy knows that jesting Pilate asked what is Truth and did not stay for an answer. But library classifiers, without benefit of publicity, have long sought to ascertain what exactly is sociology, and they still seem to be seeking. At least this appears to be the situation as one undertakes to isolate and count the volumes on this subject. We are consequently not attempting to give numerical totals for the collections in Virginia; though we realize that such a stand handicaps the General Editor of this Southern Survey when he undertakes to compare quantitatively the collections, say, in Sweet Briar and Sewanee on sociology. On the other hand it is obvious that this sociology is regarded as an exceedingly live subject and that it has resulted in the general enrichment of libraries; and most of the libraries which have received frequent mention in the Virginia summary report fairly good working collections. The largest, possibly, are at the State Library, at the College of William and Mary, at the University of Virginia, at Randolph-Macon Woman's College, at Washington and Lee, at the University of Richmond, and at Hampton Institute. The collection at the State Library is general, with some emphasis on race relations. The files of periodicals and society publications include American Child, American Journal of Sociology, Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Charities and the Commons, Journal of Social Science, New York School of Social Work Bulletin, New York State Conference on Social Work Quarterly Bulletin, Ohio Welfare Bulletin, Pennsylvania Department of Welfare Monthly Bulletin, Pennsylvania School of Social Work General Bulletin, Social Forces, Social Studies, Social Work Year Book, Southern Progress, Southern Sociological Congress Publications, Survey and Survey Graphic, Virginia Department of Public Welfare Public Welfare, Washington University Publications in Social Sciences, and Wisconsin University Studies in the Social Sciences and History. At the College of William and Mary the enphasis is on modern community social problems. There is an excellent selection of works on the history and theory of sociology. Methodology, rural sociology, community life, and the Negro are among the subjects stressed at the University of Virginia. This library and of course the library at Hampton Institute have fairly extensive collections of books on the Negro. The Hampton Institute library emphasizes race relations and rural sociology. There is a good general collection in sociology at the Randolph-Macon Woman's College. Some effort has been made here to acquire the reports of various foundations and of hospitals and charitable organizations. In the collections at Washington and Lee University family and community life, criminology, and juvenile delinquency have been emphasized; and thse subjects and urban sociology and social psychology have been stressed in the collection at the University of Richmond. Section D. Economics and Commerce. Of books on the subjects of commerce and economics the Virginia State Library has a general collection of approximately 20,000 volumes. There are files of eighty periodicals dealing with or indirectly related to these subjects; there are also sets of Moody's and Poor's service publications and of Thomas's commercial directory. The collection of corporation reports is chiefly limited to the Commonwealth of Virginia, including its railroads. Emphasis has not been sought in any special field; but as the collection has so far developed the subject of taxation is perhaps most adequately represented. At the library of Washington and Lee University there are about 11,500 books on these subjects. The standard journals are subscribed to, as are also the commercial services bearing the names of Babson, Moody, and Poor. As in the case of the State Library there are no special fields of concentration. The collection at the University of Virginia Library numbers almost exactly 5,600 volumes, in addition to which there is a sizable accumulation of pamphlets. There are sundry early publications relating to economics; and economic history, banking, and taxation are given some emphasis. At the College of William and Mary there is a total of 3,300 volumes in commerce and economics. Here too can be found a number of the earlier publications. The materials on labour and finance are perhaps the most important sections of this collection. A somewhat smaller collection (2,684 volumes) at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute is notable for its effectiveness. There are forty-seven current periodicals, some good runs of corporation reports, and commercial directories by Hendricks, by Kelly, and by MacRae. The emphasis in this collection is on the subjects of rural economics and of business management. In Richmond there are three specialized financial collections that are worthy of notice. The Federal Reserve Bank Library contains about 3,100 volumes dealing with corporations, banking, auditing, accounting, and taxation. It is well organized and has a full-time librarian, but it is commonly accessible only to employees of the Federal Reserve Bank. The Scott and Stringfellow Library, on the other hand, is open to the public. This contains a useful collection of statistical manuals and financial periodicals, and its records of bond issues local, national, and foreign are extensive. The State Corporation Commission Library contains 3,000 or more volumes, chiefly dealing with corporations. Section E. Political Science. The political science material at the Virginia State Library amounts to about 18,000 volumes. On the history and theory of government (mostly in the United States) there are 1,000 volumes; on state government the number is approximately 2,000; and there are perhaps 250 on foreign governments. Public finance, with about 3,000 volumes, and public health, with about 1,500, are emphasized. Of periodicals there are files, some being incomplete, of twenty-five varieties. On international relations there is no extensive amount of book material; but the library possesses ten periodicals which deal with international relations. The General Library and the Bureau of Public Administration Library at the University of Virginia have a combined total of 11,605 volumes and 34,870 pamphlets in political science, this being exclusive of federal and state documents. Stress is laid on such subjects as public administration, public finance, and government, with some special relation to municipalities. Current numbers of 145 serials are being received, the majority being government and municipal journals which are on the exchange lists of the Bureau of Public Administration. Contrary to the usual condition in this and in many other Virginia libraries, the pamphlet collection on public administration is strong in European materials. Several other libraries have fair sized working collections, the emphasis varying considerably according to location. For example, at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute there are 2,229 volumes in political science with the emphasis on local government and city planning. At the College of William and Mary there are 1,925 volumes of which fully one quarter deal with constitutional theory and history. At the University of Richmond there are over 1,500 volumes, not including periodicals; and here the stress is on such subjects as public finance and social work. At the Randolph-Macon Woman's College there are 1,364 volumes with additional pamphlet material, at Hampton Institute there are 1,272 volumes, and at Washington and Lee University there are approximately 1,200 volumes, no particular emphasis being recorded. The collection of 1,034 volumes at Sweet Briar College includes one of the most extensive files of League of Nations publications in the State. Full sets of these publications seem surprisingly hard to locate. At the Union Theological Seminary there has been affort to collect material on `war and peace' and 5,170 items are reported on these and other political science topics. Section F. Education. The Heck Memorial Library of Education at the University of Virginia contains 13,729 volumes. Secondary, higher, and adult education are the major divisions emphasized, and among the fields of special strength are curriculum construction, educational psychology, educational statistics, and the history of education. There is a fairly large group of administrative reports of colleges and universities, and some attention has been given to the assembling of early textbooks as illustrations of textbook trends and school subject developments. The current periodical material includes the American School Board Journal, California Journal of Secondary Education, Education, Educational Administration and Supervision, Educational Record, Educational Review, Educational Screen, Elementary School Journal, English Journal, Journal of Education, Journal of Educational Method, Journal of Educational Psychology, Journal of Educational Research, Journal of Higher Education, Journal of the National Education Association, Junior-Senior High School Clearing House, Mathematics Teacher, Nation's Schools, Pedagogical Seminary, Progressive Education, Review of Educational Research, School and Society, School Review, Teachers' College Record, Virginia Journal of Education, Virginia Teacher. The education section in the State Library numbers 7,560 volumes not including periodicals. This is a general collection without special emphasis. But considerable strength may be noted in the publications of educational societies and of state and city departments of education. In the latter group thirty-five states are represented, the sets being fullest for the southern and eastern sections of the country. At the College of William and Mary there are 4,400 volumes on educational subjects, the major emphasis being laid on elementary education, with especial strength in curriculum study and development. Eighteen educational periodicals and twenty-nine fraternity publications are currently received. There is a collection of about 600 early textbooks, the main objective being to throw light on curriculum development in William and Mary and other colleges. In the library at Hampton Institute there are 3,856 volumes in education, and twenty-one current serials are received. The emphasis in this collection is on industrial education, physical education, educational sociology, curriculum construction, and tests and measurements. The Virginia Polytechnic Institute, which has 3,600 volumes in education, is, like the State Library, strong in the publications of associations and institutions. The emphasis is general, but some stress has been placed on industrial education and educational psychology. Of the four State Teachers' Colleges, the institution at Farmville has 2,396 volumes in education, the institution at Fredericksburg has 1,825, the institution at East Radford has 1,434, and the institution at Harrisonburg has 1,365. In all four cases elementary and secondary education are emphasized. Farmville and East Radford have fairly extensive collections of educational journals and of society publications and yearbooks. Fredericksburg has an interesting assortment of early school texts, mainly in English language and literature. Section G. Law. The most extensive law collections in Virginia are at the State Law Library in Richmond, numbering approximately 45,000 volumes, and at the Law Library of the University of Virginia, numbering 30,533 volumes (1 July 1937). The State Law Library is administered as a department of the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. It is a general library with no particular emphasis on special fields. The collection of reports for the Supreme Court of the United States, for the Circuit and District Courts of the United States, for the regional groups of the states, and for the individual states is fairly complete. The sets of the session laws of the United States and of the individual states are complete for about a hundred years; and there are the majority of the official codes, digests, and statutes. Of legal texts and treatises there are approximately 3,000 volumes; and the library receives twenty-six legal periodicals. THe reports of attorneys-general and of bar associations cover the federal and the Virginia publications in both cases. In foreign law the emphasis is on English material. There is a selection of famous trials of former years and several histories of law. The Law Library at the University of Virginia is also general in content. The reports of the Supreme Court and of the Circuit and District Courts of the United States, of the seven or eight regional groups of states, and of the individual states are full, numbering 4,806 volumes. Of the session laws, codes, and digests of statutes there are 200 volumes for the United States and 845 volumes of statutes for the separate states. There are 485 briefs of the United States Supreme Court. The legal texts and treatises number 3,450, and there are received about 100 legal periodicals, the bound volumes numbering 1,673. The material on foreign law is notably strong, the majority of the 4,368 volumes being in the John Bassett Moore collection of works on international law. Another special collection, in memory of Raleigh C. Minor, has enriched the collection with quasilegal materials, which amount to 1,227 volumes, and include legal anecdotes, records of famous trials, histories of law, and legal fiction. The library of the T. C. Williams School of Law at the University of Richmond contains approximately 15,000 volumes. The sets of law reports are extensive, and the session laws and codes of Virginia are complete. The collection of legal briefs and treatises is full, numbering about 4,000; and over twenty legal periodicals are received. There are full sets of the American and of the Virginia Bar Associations, and considerable material on English law. There is a total of 11,250 volumes in the law library at the College of William and Mary. The emphasis in this collection is on constitutional law. Of law reports, national and state, there is a total of 5,534 volumes; and of statutes, codes, and digests there are 1,310 volumes. At the time this survey was taken the legal texts and treatises numbered 1,394 volumes. The more important of the legal periodicals are currently received. As in the other law collections in this state, the Virginia items tend to be most numerous; and there are sixty-eight volumes of the reports of the Virginia Attorney-General and ninety-two volumes of reports from the Virginia Bar Association. As in the other collections also, the majority of the works on foreign law deal with England, there being in this case a total of 1,476 volumes. Of the quasi-legal materials there are about 250 volumes. There is a fifth effective collection in the law library of Washington and Lee University. This contains the reports of the United States Supreme Court, of the lower federal courts, and of the large majority of the state courts of last resort. The collection of codes and digests is also fairly full. There are complete files of twenty-four legal periodicals, and incomplete files of twenty others. Of foreign law there is a considerable amount, mostly dealing with the British Isles and with Canada. Section H. History. Of books and periodicals in history which may be listed as GENERAL there are 1,100 volumes at the State Library, 1,000 at the University of Virginia, and 800 at the College of William and Mary. A census of general historical periodicals and society publications at the State Library is as follows: American Catholic Historical Society Records, 1907-date (incomplete); American Historical Association Papers, 1886-91; American Historical Record, 1872-74 (continued as Potter's American Monthly); American Historical Review; American-Irish Historical Society Journal, 1898-1900, 1906-07, 1909-15, 1918-32; Americana (American Historical Magazine) 1927-date; California University Publications in History, volumes 1-23 (incomplete); Carnegie Institution of Washington, Report of the Department of Historical Research, 1912, 1919-35; Catholic Historical Review, 1915-22; Current History; English Historical Review, 1904-10; Historical Magazine and Notes and Queries Concerning the Antiquities, History, and Biography of America, 1857-75 (incomplete); Historical Magazine of the Protestant Episcopal Church; History Reference Bulletin, 1933date; Johns Hopkins University Studies in Historical and Political Science, Journal of American History, 1877-93; Magazine of History, 1905-13; Potter's American Monthly, 1875-77 (formerly American Historical Record); Quarterly Review, 1809-67; Royal Historical Society Publications, third series, volumes 8-53 (incomplete); Royal Historical Society Transactions, new series, volumes 19-20, third series, volumes 1-11, fourth series, volumes 1-date. Other general history serials at the State Library include the American Annual Register, 1825-32; the Annual Register, 1758-1872; the Edinburgh Annual Register, 1808-26; eight or ten general almanacs, and about twenty-five local American almanacs published since 1850. There are also fairly extensive sets of general historical periodicals at the University of Virginia and at the College of William and Mary. Both of these collections have full runs of the Annual Register. At William and Mary there are thirty volumes of later eighteenth and early nineteenth century American almanacs; and at the University of Virginia there are a few scattering examples of foreign almanacs. Smaller but noteworthy collections of general historical material may be found at the Coast Artillery School, at the University of Richmond, and at Sweet Briar College. Each collection numbers about 500 volumes. A mild form of ARCHAEOLOGY is prevalent in college curricula, with symptomatic evidence in library collections. But acquisition of such material is likely to develop rapidly into an expensive stage which requires shelf filling folios; and collections of even moderate size are likely to yield resources for research. Combining the archaeology and ancient history of Europe, the Mediterranean regions, and the Orient, there are at least seven libraries in Virginia which possess 500 or more volumes; namely, the University of Virginia (1,677), the College of William and Mary (1,050), Randolph-Macon Woman's College (969), Union Theological Seminary (850), the State Library (650), Sweet Briar (522), and the University of Richmond (500 plus). In the collection at the University of Virginia, as is true in the majority of these collections, the emphasis is on Greece and Rome. but there is already a fair beginning of Egyptian material. Reports are included from the American Academy at Rome, the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, the American School of Oriental Research, the Archaeological Institute of America, the Archaeologisches Institut des Deutschen Reichs, the British School of Archaeology in Egypt, the British Schools in Athens and in Rome, the Deutschen Archaeologischen Instituts, and the Oriental Institute. There are complete files of L'Acropole, American Journal of Archaeology, Antiquity, Archaeological Journal, Athenische Mitteilungen, Greece and Rome, Hesperia, Journal of Hellenic Studies, Journal of Roman Studies; there are also incomplete but current files of the Bulletin de Correspondence HellÃ©nique, Notizie degli Scavi, Revue Archaeologique, RÃ¶mische Mitteilungen, and Zeitschrift fÃ¼r die Altertumswissenschaft. In this collection are full accounts of the excavations at Corinth, Ephesus, Knossos, Mallia, Mycenae, Olynthus, Priene, Sparta, Stratos, Tiryns, and partial information relating to other excavated sites. For Greek inscriptions there are such sets as the Inscriptiones Graecae and its new Editio Minor, Dittenberger's Sylloge Inscriptionum Graecarum, and Collitz's Sammlung der Griechischen Dialekt-Inscriften; for Latin inscriptions there is the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum and its supplement, the Ephemeria Epigraphica. Material on ceramics is found in sundry illustrative works such as the Corpus Vasorum Antiquorum, Pfuhl's Malerei und Zeichnung, and Beazley's individual studies. The subjects of sculpture and portraiture have been fairly well developed for archaeology as well as for fine arts;* * Page 33. but little effort has been made to build up under archaeology a separate group of works on architecture; and no particular attention has as yet been given to numismatics. The collections in archaeology and ancient history in the other libraries which have been listed have a similar character and emphasis, with the exception of the one at the Spence Library in the Union Theological Seminary. In this case particular attention is given to the excavations and the ancient records of Palestine, Egypt, and Mesopotamia, and there are included various reports and other publications from the associations and exploration funds (such as the Egypt Exploration Fund, the Expedition Scientifique en Mesopotamie, the Harvard excavations at Samaria, the Palestine Exploration Fund, and the Society of Biblical Archaeology) which have been organized for these regions. There seem at present to be no very significant collections in MEDIAEVAL HISTORY among these libraries. Possibly the nearest approach to significance for research is in the material on ecclesiastical history in the Episcopal and Union Theological Seminaries. This material, however, has already been recorded in Part Two, Humanities, Section E, Religion,** ** Pages 35-36. For example, about 500 volumes of the collection at the Union Theological Seminary might appropriately be classed as mediaeval history. The University of Virginia has 300 volumes on this subject, and the College of William and Mary and the University of Richmond about 250 volumes each. At the University of Richmond there is some material on nearly all phases of mediaeval civilization and history. At William and Mary the most emphasis, perhaps, is on the crusades, art, and culture. At the University of Virginia among the subjects which have the more adequate treatment is the Byzantine Empire. The Cambridge Mediaeval History and the periodical Speculum seem to be in the majority of the collections. There are several sets also of Migne's Patrologiae. The University of Virginia has the Chronicles and Memorials of Great Britain, the Corpus Scriptorum Historiae Byzantinei, and the Monumenta Germaniae Historica. In MODERN EUROPEAN HISTORY there is a fair amount of general material in Virginia libraries, but not a great deal that is outstanding for purposes of research. It has already been noted that these collections are weak in foreign documents and monumental sets. Where such material does appear, it is most likely to be found in connection with the backgrounds of American colonial history or with the recent World War. On the subject of the World War, however, there is one specialized collection in Virginia that is of considerable importance; this is comprised of the military material at the library of the Coast Artillery School. A large part of this might possibly be classed as American military history, since it is the record of participation by the United States. But the terrain is largely European. The general material includes 8,555 items and the material dealing with specific countries of 6,149 items, a combined total of 14,484. The historical background and sundry printed reports are in book form, but the collection is primarily composed of military archives. At the University of Virginia, on the other hand, the approach to the World War is largely through diplomatic history, and this collection includes a considerable part of the documentary publications issued by the Belgian, British, French, German, and Russian governments. In addition to world war material, the University of Virginia has sundry sets, more or less complete, such as the publications of the British Historical Manuscripts Commission, the Documents InÃ©dits sur l'Histoire de France and Le Moniteur Universel, and the Spanish Coleccion de Documentos Ineditos, this last set relating to colonial possessions. There is a considerable amount of material on Napoleon and on Mazzini and the period of the Risorgimento in Italy. Combining the general European material with the material dealing with special countries there are 6,834 volumes in modern European history at the University of Virginia. A similar combination at the State Library gives a total of 5,235 volumes. A valuable part of this collection consists of material of various forms relating to the American colonial possessions of Great Britain, France, and Spain. This statement may be repeated for the collection on modern European history at the College of William and Mary, which totals 2,859 volumes. This includes the colonial material in the Calendar of State Papers, the Journal of the Commissioners for Foreign Trade and Plantations, the Reports of the Historical Manuscripts Commission, Hansard's Debates (down to 1830), and the Harleian Society Publications. At the Randolph-Macon Woman's College there are 2,174 volumes of modern history relating to Europe and its countries. As is generally true in the Virginia libraries, the larger part of the collection deals with Great Britain. In ASIATIC HISTORY the State Library has a collection of 875 volumes, subdivided as follows: general material, fifty volumes; southwestern Asia, 300 (including Palestine and the Jews, 180); minor Asiatic regions, 100; India, 230, China, 110, and Japan and Korea, eighty-five volumes. The library at the University of Richmond has over 400 volumes in Asiatic history, the countries most largely represented being China with 150 volumes, Japan with 125, and India with about 100. At the Coast Artillery School there are about 300 volumes in Asiatic history. Here, too, China with ninety-four volumes and Japan with seventy-seven afford the largest amount of material. The Collis P. Huntington Memorial Library at Hampton Institute contains what is probably the largest collection in Virginia of material on AFRICAN HISTORY. This is a general collection amounting to 481 volumes, and includes a file of the periodical, Africa. Other collections, all of them general in character, include one of 240 volumes at the State Library, one of over 125 volumes at the University of Richmond, and one of about 120 volumes at the Coast Artillery School. In the last of these libraries, however, there is some emphasis on Egypt. The materials on the history of OCEANICA show still further shrinkage. The library at the Mariners' Museum contains about 200 volumes for those far-flung islands, the State Library has 190, and the library at the Coast Artillery School has over 100. The Philippines and Hawaii tend to figure most prominently. For LATIN-AMERICAN HISTORY the largest collection in Virginia is at the State Library, comprising 770 volumes. This includes sundry documentary publications, such as Blanco's Documentos para la Historia de la Vida Publica del Libertador de Colombia and Manning's Diplomatic Correspondence of the United States, both the set on Inter-American Affairs and the set Concerning the Independence of the Latin-American Nations. There are also runs of the Boletin Historico de Puerto Rico, the Hispanic American Historical Review, and the Pan American Union Bulletin. Smaller collections on Latin-America, each numbering between 200 and 250 volumes, are at Hampton Institute and at the University of Virginia. Among the Virginia libraries there are some fairly extensive collections of material on UNITED STATES HISTORY, both general and local; and a dozen or so of the other libraries which have been frequently named in this report have made commendable beginnings in this field. For general material the State Library, the College of William and Mary, the Coast Artillery School, and the University of Virginia have the largest aggregation of volumes; and in state and local history the State Library, William and Mary, the Virginia Historical Society, the University of Richmond, and the University of Virginia can at present claim numerical priority. At the State Library there are some 500 volumes classified as history of the Indians and of aboriginal America. These include the United States government publications issued by the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and the Smithsonian Institution; and also Bancroft's Works, the Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents, and a considerable number of early books of description and travel. Material of very similar character may be found at the University of Virginia to the amount of about 750 volumes and at the College of William and Mary to the amount of about 300 volumes; and the Virginia Historical Society contains a considerable number of individual works on the Indian. The collection at the State Library on discovery, exploration, and the colonial period numbers about 730 volumes of history and 400 volumes of descriptive works. Among these may be named the American Antiquarian Society's Archaeologica Americana; C. L. Andrews' Narratives of the Insurrections, 1675-1698; Bristol and America, a Record of the First Settlers in the Colonies of North America, 1654-1685; Edmond Burke's Account of the European Settlements in America, 1758; Champlain's Oeuvres; Church's Catalogue of Books Relating to the Discovery and Early History of North and South America; F. G. Davenport's European Treatises Bearing on the History of the United States and its Dependencies; B. F. French's Historical Collections of Louisiana, 1846-53; Herrero y Tordesillas, General History of the Vast Continent and Islands of America, 1725-26; Hotten's Original Lists of Persons of Quality; Labaree's Royal Instructions to British Colonial Governors, 1670-1776; Joannis de Laet's Novus Orbis, 1633; John Ogilby's America; Francis Parkman's Works; Purchas his Pilgrimage, 1614; and both series of Sherwood's American Colonists in English Records. At the University of Virginia there are about 1,000 volumes on these subjects, at the Coast Artillery School there are 644, and at the College of William and Mary there are 460. The collections at the University of Virginia and at William and Mary contain a considerable amount of material in historical periodicals. For the Revolution and the early national period the State Library has approximately 1,300 volumes, its collection of periodicals and of society publications being extensive. In the 805 volumes at the Coast Artillery School the military features of the Revolutionary War are emphasized. A collection of 600 volumes at the College of William and Mary contains complete sets of a number of federal and state archival publications. In connection with the Revolutionary War it may be recalled that film copies of source material on the War in the South is being rapidly collected at the Yorktown headquarters of the Colonial National Historical Park.* * Page 13. On the Civil War and slavery the State Library has about 2,750 volumes - 500 on the period immediately preceding the war, 2,000 on the war itself, and 250 on slavery, these being in addition to the slavery material classified among the social sciences. This extensive collect on includes periodical and society publications, official records, reports of adjutant-generals of states, rosters of soldiers, histories of military units, records of later encampments of veterans, and biographical sketches of military and political leaders. Together with the smaller but valuable collections at the Virginia Historical Society, the Confederate Museum Library, and the Confederate Memorial Institute, this material at the State Library makes Richmond a favourable center for research on topics developing from the War Between the States. Outside of Richmond there are good collections at the College of William and Mary and at the University of Virginia, each numbering about 1,000 volumes. It may not be out of place to comment on the frequency with which a browser in Virginia libraries meets with the 128 volumes of the War of the Rebellion: Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies. For the period of reconstruction, a considerable amount of the material seems to exist in newspaper files and in pamphlet and manuscript collections. It is therefore likely to be most available in libraries where such forms are abundant. Of printed books dealing with this era the State Library has about 300 volumes and the College of William and Mary 215. Some emphasis has been given to recent United States history at the University of Virginia and its library has rather more than 800 volumes which may be classified as of this period. In the field of local and state history the Virginia specialty has been Virginia. Wherever in the state there is a collection of books there is likely to be a collection of Virginiana. The natural result is a large duplication of the more common items. But a fortunate outcome of this general interest is the enhanced possibility that the uncommon and perhaps obscure publication will be recognized and preserved. In the Bibliography of Virginia History since 1865* * Cappon, Lester Jesse. Bibliography of Virginia history since 1865 ... University, Va., Institute for research in the social sciences, 1930. xviii, 900 p. (University of Virginia. Institute for research in the social sciences. Institute monograph no.5) by the Archivist of the University of Virginia Library, locations of 6,242 items are given for twenty-eight libraries, of which ten are in Virginia. If this plan were to be carried out in the form of a union catalogue of Virginiana for all Virginia libraries, it is quite likely that some of the smaller libraries would be found to make a very creditable showing. In this present report, however, only five of the largest collections will be mentioned; namely, those at the State Library, the College of William and Mary, the Virginia Historical Society, the University of Virginia, and the University of Richmond. In this field of local and state history the Virginia State Library has a collection of 9,100 volumes. The emphasis is on Virginia and the South, but the New England and other northern states are also well represented. The collection includes books, pamphlets, periodicals, maps, and some clippings and pictures; statements have previously been made** ** Pages 7, 8, 9-10, 15-16. with regard to the Virginia newspapers, public documents, and manuscripts in this library. There are files, some incomplete, of seventy-six local historical periodicals or serial publications. The extent of the Virginiana has been impressively indicated by the Bibliography of Virginia*** *** Swem, Earl Gregg. A bibliography of Virginia ... Richmond, Bottom, 1916-17. 2 vol. (In Virginia. State Library. Bulletin, VIII, 2-4; X, 1-4) Pt.I: Titles of books in the Virginia state library which relate to Virginia and Virginians; titles of books written by Virginians, and of those printed in Virginia; with index. which was issued as a Bulletin of the State Library twenty years ago, since this was a record of the holdings of that library. A list of the outstanding items would be too long for inclusion in this survey report. But it would include early editions or reprints of most of the Virginia histories and other important Virginiana, and it would reveal that special efforts have been made to secure all available publications in such directions as the literature of early voyages and travels and the historical records of Virginia counties and towns. Another Virginia collection significant for research purposes is located at the College of William and Mary. This numbers 3,485 volumes, of which 1,575 are about Virginia state, county, and town history. Colonial, Revolutionary, and Civil War accounts, both of people and places, have been stressed; and the localities spread from Williamsburg through James City County, Virginia, and the surrounding southern states. There are long files of thirty-seven local history periodicals, and each of these is complete from 1920 to date. The Virginia Historical Index,* * Swem, Earl Gregg. Virginia historical index ... Roanoke, Va. ... Stone printing and manufacturing company, 1934-36. 2 vol. that extraordinary open sesame to the contents of the most important Virginia historical magazines, is the product of long years of skilled effort on the part of the Librarian of William and Mary; and it has made this and every other similar collection of Virginiana more valuable because of the increased accessibility of the Virginia periodical material in those collections. The importance of the Virginia Historical Society as a depository for manuscripts has already been pointed out,** ** Pages 10, 11. and mention has also been made*** *** Page 16. of its files of Virginia newspapers. But the object of the Society has been to collect everything that has historical interest (there are perhaps 30,000 items in the whole library), and one or two additional phases of this collecting activity should be mentioned here. The maps of the state which belong to the Virginia Historical Society extend in date from 1598 to 1933. Of book material there are well over 800 volumes of local history, dealing largely with Virginia but also including Maryland, North Carolina, and the New England States. In Virginia itself such cities as Alexandria, Fredericksburg, Richmond, Williamsburg, and Winchester are largely represented. The library at the University of Richmond is effectively equipped with material on United States history both in its general phases and in local Virginia material. There are about 700 Virginia volumes, not including biography, pamphlets, and periodicals. These cover sectional, county, and town histories and economic, educational, political, and social development. Of primary importance for research is the Virginia Baptist Historical Society Collection on the religious history of the State. At the University of Virginia some effort has been made to acquire state histories and the publications of state historical societies without regional limitations. But for purely local material the emphasis has been on Virginia. The collection of Virginiana numbers about 6,000 volumes - though this total includes Virginia imprints and the writings of Virginians as well as materials of historical content. The sets of local histories are as complete as it has so far been possible to make them; and church histories, maps, and almanacs are largely represented. As an example of intensive collecting, there is in this library a nearly complete set of the editions of Thomas Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia - this early `best seller', untrammeled by copyright limitations, ran to thirty or more editions. But in this statement, as in the statements for these four other collections of local and state history, it has seemed wise to resist the temptation to include lists of rare items. The foregoing consideration of the Virginia collections in United States history by periods and subjects probably affords the best approach to an estimate of the foundation and resource materials. It is difficult to arrive at even approximately correct numerical totals for purposes of comparison, since the practice varies with regard to inclusion of document, pamphlet, and periodical items. But it may be safe to state that, in general and local United States history combined, the State Library has at least 15,000 volumes, the University of Virginia 8,500 volumes, and the College of William and Mary 6,000 volumes. Moderately good collections in BIOGRAPHY, not varying greatly in size, are scattered over the State of Virginia. In material there is some regional and more national emphasis; but the prevailing effect is that of general collections. The American and English dictionaries of biography are quite common. It would appear that the new Dictionary of American Biography has found a good market in this State. The monumental foreign dictionaries are less frequent. But a brief location list may serve to indicate the situation. Allegemeine Deutsche Biographie. At Randolph-Macon Woman's College, State Library, University of Virginia. Chevalier, RÃ©pertoire des Sources Historiques du Moyen Age. At University of Virginia. Dictionnaire de Biographie Francaise. At Hollins College, Sweet Briar, University of Virginia. Hoefer, Nouvelle Biographie GÃ©nÃ©rale. At University of Virginia. Michaud, Biographie Universelle, Ancienne et Moderne. At State Library, University of Virginia. Saxe, Onomasticon Literarium. At Randolph-Macon Woman's College, University of Virginia. Vapereau, Dictionnaire Universel des Contemporains. At Sweet Briar, University of Virginia. The collection at the University of Virginia numbers approximately 8,000 volumes. Recent national material is at present tending to predominate. But Great Britain is also well represented, there being several of the longer sets such as: Bayle's General Dictionary, Brougham and Vaux's Historical Sketches of Statesmen who Flourished in the Time of George III, Campbell's Lives of the Lords Chancellors, Lives of the Chief Justices of England, Lives of the British Admirals, Cibber's Lives of the Poets of Great Britain and Ireland, Foss's Judges of England, Lodge's Portraits of Illustrious Personages of Great Britain, Strickland's Lives of the Queens of England, and Wood's Athenae Oxoninses. At the State Library there are 6,500 volumes under this heading. Here early biography predominates, and the emphasis is perhaps on statesmen and military leaders of the United States, particularly of the South and of Virginia. There are, however, 1,270 volumes of English individual biography. Of the 4,560 volumes in biography at the College of William and Mary the majority are of recent publication, and there is no regional division. Lives of statesmen and of literary figures are perhaps most largely represented. The collection of approximately 3,500 volumes at the University of Richmond is fairly representative for individuals of Virginia and of the South. The types of subjects which predominate are political, religious, literary, and educational. A census, made at the time this survey was taken, of the volumes of biographical material in some of the other institutional libraries of the State, gives the following figures - figures which of course have in every case become too small by the time this report has emerged:- Washington and Lee University, 3,300 volumes; Hampton Institute, 3,162; Virginia Military Institute, 1,804; Coast Artillery School, 1,750; Sweet Briar College, 1,714; Union Theological Seminary, 1,600; Episcopal Theological Seminary, 1,500. These last two collections of course are primarily of religious leaders. The larger public libraries also have collections comparable in size with those which have been listed. It is a library maxim that GENEALOGY is the thief of time; and competition for priority in genealogical collections seems not to be active. In this subject, however, three Virginia libraries have moderately full collections concerning local and regional families, with roots going back to localities in Great Britain. These are the library at the College of William and Mary, with 1,290 volumes; the State Library, with 1,150 volumes, not counting periodicals; and the library of the Virginia Historical Society, with over 1,000 volumes. III. SCIENCE Section A. General Science. There are three libraries in Virginia which contain almost exactly 2,000 volumes in general science: the State Library, the library of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and the library of the University of Virginia. Yet these form an excellent illustration of the fact that differences may exist among collections numerically equal. The material at the State Library represents the whole field and includes files of two dozen or more serials, mainly the publications of American museums and scientific societies. The collection at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute contains runs of thirty-eight general science periodicals or society serials, and there are interesting groups of works on the history and on the philosophy of science. At the University of Virginia the serial section of the collection in general science includes the publications of twenty academies of science, a number of which are foreign. Two other Virginia libraries deserve mention in this connection. At the College of William and Mary there are 1,250 volumes in general science, which include thirty periodicals and an unusual number of early works â works, that is, which were published before 1800. At the Virginia Military Institute the central library contains 858 volumes in general science, including a number of American periodicals, and there is a separate departmental library housing a number of general works. Section B. Geology. The collection in geology at the University of Virginia numbers 4,420 volumes and an extensive file of maps and surveys. The sets of United States state and federal surveys are almost complete, and Canada, India, and various other countries are well represented. The library contains geological publications from Glasgow, Harvard, Stanford, Texas, Toronto, Uppsala, and several other universities; and among the periodicals and society publications are American Geologist, Economic Geology, the Field Museum Geological Series, Geological Magazine, the Geological Society of America Bulletin and Proceedings, Geological Society of London Quarterly Journal, Journal of Geology, the publications of the Lemberg Universytet Instytut Geofizyki i Meteorologji, and the Pan-American Geologist. At the State Library there are 2,600 volumes on geology, atlases and maps for all states covered by the United States Geological Survey, surveys of twenty-five states, chiefly east of the Mississippi River, and full sets of nearly all of the federal publications, such as annual reports, bulletins, monographs, and professional papers. The library at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute contains 1,858 volumes and a considerable number of uncatalogued publications, periodicals, and maps. There is a somewhat similar reference and teaching collection, of approximately 1,000 volumes, at Washington and Lee University. Section C. Geography. For research material in geography the collection at the Mariners' Museum near Newport News is outstanding among Virginia libraries. This special library* * Access to the library of the Mariners' Museum is granted to qualified research students. contains 19,438 books and pamphlets, which include bibliographical material, society publications, treatises on maritime law, and historical works (chiefly naval) of Europe, Asia, Oceanica, and the Americas. But the collection is particularly strong in geographical subjects and in naval science (see Technology, Section B., Military and Naval Science** ** Page 66. ). In geographical subjects there are, for example, the works of the cartographers Arnoldus, Blaeu, Danckerts, Delisle, Dewitt, Homann, Hondius, Janssonius, Linschoten, Lotter, Mercator, Moll, Ortelius, Ptolemy, Sanson, Speed, and Vaugondy. There are massive sets of collected voyages and travels such as the Histoire GÃ©nÃ©rale des Voyages, twenty-five volumes; Le Tour de Monde, thirty-five volumes; and the collections of Balbi, Churchill, Grasset de Saint-Sauveur, Hakluyt, Harris, Kemys, Mavor, Phillips, Pinkerton, Prevost, and Purchas. American and English government publications are well represented; and among the society publications are the American Geographical Society Research Papers, the Boletin de la Sociedad Geographica de Madrid, and the Journal and the Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society. Several other libraries in the State contain map material worthy of note. At the State Library the map collection, printed and manuscript, comprises about 10,000 items, a considerable part pertaining to Virginia and its divisions. Not a few of these items are rare. At the Coast Artillery School there is also a large collection of maps, the emphasis naturally being on material of direct military import; but there are also complete files of geological and geodetic and airways maps. A smaller collection at the University of Virginia includes some early state maps and a set of photographic reproductions of Virginia maps from the French archives. Of localities represented in map collections in Virginia, Williamsburg and the Yorktown peninsula are outstanding, the collections of local maps at the College of William and Mary, at Colonial Williamsburg, Incorporated, and at the Colonial National Historical Park at Yorktown covering this area with extraordinary completeness. As for books on discovery, exploration, and travel, they show a tendency to be nomadic in library classification: for copies of the same work turn up under history in some libraries and under geography in others. Here again, therefore, comparison of collections merely by size is unsatisfactory. At the University of Virginia the trend has apparently been to migrate to geography, the census of the general book collection under that subject showing 4,771 volumes when this survey was made. The Barnard Shipp Collection and other donations have brought a considerable number of the more important travel books and many minor works to this library. There is some emphasis on early American discovery and exploration; and of atlases, gazetteers, and guide books the number is considerable. Other noteworthy book collections on geographic subjects, each totaling approximately 1,000 volumes, are at the library of the University of Richmond, the library of Washington and Lee University, and the State Library. Several of the public libraries contain excellent collections of travel books, the Petersburg Public Library deserving special recognition among these. Section D. Astronomy. The astronomy library at the University of Virginia comprises 2,541 volumes and an extensive assortment of serial publications. The standard works are included; and there are such sets as Albrecht, Resultate des Internationalen Beitendienste; Andoyer, Cours de MÃ©canique CÃ©leste; Bessel, Abhandlungen; Dombowski, Misure Micrometriche di Stelle; Enske, Gesammelte Mathematische und Astronomische Abhandlungen; Graff, Grundriss der Astrophysik; Laplace, MÃ©chanique CÃ©leste; and Valentiner, HandwÃ¶rterbuch der Astronomie. The monumental Handbuch der Astrophysik is being received as it appears. Reports and other publications are on file from 116 astronomical observatories. In a number of cases these are scattering. But twenty-seven sets, representing the more important observatories, are complete; and forty-three are being received currently. Astronomical maps and atlases form a noteworthy part of the collection, and astrographic catalogues from nineteen observatories are available. Another important section is composed of nautical almanacs and ephemerides, which represent thirteen countries. Of periodicals and society publications there are forty-seven on file, thirteen being complete, and twenty-two being received currently. There are, therefore, about 200 astronomical serials of one sort and another in this collection, at least forty of the sets being complete, and some sixty-five to seventy being currently received. The State Library and the library at the Coast Artillery School each contains about 350 volumes in astronomy, these collections being for the most part of a general character. Section E. Mathematics. In the library at the Coast Artillery School at Old Point Comfort there is a collection of 2,649 books in mathematics, including a moderate number of periodicals. The books are mainly in English, but some of the earlier works are represented. This collection forms the basis for various technical studies in connection with the activities of the School. Mathematical analysis forms a line of special interest. At the University of Virginia there are approximately 1,400 volumes in mathematics. There are at present full sets of only a comparatively few periodicals; but the following mathematical journals (not including academy publications) are being currently received:- Acta Mathematica, American Journal of Mathematics, American Mathematical Monthly, American Mathematical Society Bulletin, Transactions, and Colloquium Publications, Annals of Mathematics, Bulletin de Mathematiques et de Physique Pure et Appliquees, Bulletin des Sciences Mathematiques, California University Publications in Mathematics and Physical Sciences, Composito Mathematica, Duke Mathematical Journal, Ergebnisse der Mathematik, Fundamenta Mathematica, Jahresbericht der Deutschen Mathematiker-Vereingung, Journal fÃ¼r die Reine und Angewandte Mathematik, London Mathematical Society Proceedings, Mathematica, Mathematics News-Letter, Mathematics Teacher, Mathematische Annalen, Mathematische Zeitschrift, Messenger of Mathematics, Monatschefte fÃ¼r Mathematik und Physik, Monografje Matematyczae, Nouvelles Annales de Mathematiques, Quarterly Journal of Mathematics, Quellen und Studien zur Geschichte de Mathematik, Rendiconti del Circolo Mathematico di Palermo, School Science and Mathematics, Tohoku Mathematical Journal, Washington (State) University Publications in Mathematics, Zentralblatt fÃ¼r Mathematik und ihre Grenzgebiete. At the library of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute the collection in mathematics numbers 714 volumes. This is a general collection. It includes the French edition of the EncyclopÃ©die des Sciences Mathematiques Pure et AppliquÃ©es. Section F. Physics. The collection in physics at the University of Virginia numbers 3,715 volumes, which include the Handbuch der Physik, the Handbuch der Experimental Physik, full runs of a number of periodicals, and the current receipt of twenty-two physics journals. The most notable contribution of this collection to purposes of research is in the Lomb Collection on Optics. This comprises 819 volumes and several thousand pamphlets, a number of which would be difficult to duplicate. The library at the Coast Artillery School contains 2,193 volumes in physics, the fields of special interest being electricity, heat, and optics. At the State Library there is a general collection of approximately 1,300 volumes. The College of William and Mary, the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and Washington and Lee University all have from 750 to 800 volumes in the subject of physics. Section G. Chemistry. The collection in chemistry at the University of Virginia comprises 7,565 volumes, of which about three-fifths are chemical journals. Of the back sets of journals and of the sixty varieties currently received, a considerable proportion is made up of foreign publications. Among the comprehensive works are those by Beilstein, Gmelin-Kraut, Heilbron, Mellor, and Richter. The special fields of interest include drugs, food chemistry, dyes, and bio-chemistry. At Washington and Lee University there are approximately 3,250 volumes in chemistry. The collection includes a fair proportion of serial publications; and among the monumental sets are those by Beilstein, Gmelin-Kraut, Grignard, Heilbron, Mellor, and Richter. There are no special fields of interest. The libraries at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and at the University of Richmond both contain about 1,500 volumes in chemistry, which include good runs of periodicals and several of the monumental sets which have been issued in this subject. At the Virginia Polytechnic Institute the special fields of interest are agricultural, cellulose, and rayon chemistry. Considerable emphasis has been given at the University of Richmond to chemical history and to the biographies of chemists. The Medical College of Virginia in Richmond has greatly strengthened its material in medical sciences by acquiring periodical material in general science and in most of the special sciences. In chemistry, for example, this library contains runs of twenty-six chemical journals which total 941 volumes. Section H. Biological Sciences. There are approximately 1,100 volumes in GENERAL BIOLOGY at the University of Virginia. The collection includes some bibliographical and some biographical material, and there are twenty-two periodicals currently received. Five libraries in Virginia are notably close in reported amount of material in general biology: the College of William and Mary, 655 volumes; the State Library, 650 volumes; Randolph-Macon Woman's College, 625 volumes; Virginia Polytechnic Institute, 594 volumes; and Hampton Institute, 592 volumes. Of these, the library at Virginia Polytechnic Institute is comparatively strong in periodical holdings. Both that library and the library at Randolph-Macon Woman's College subscribe to the Wistar Institute Bibliographic Services. Apparently most of the college and university libraries have been currently receiving Biological Abstracts. Of material on BOTANY the library of the Virginia Polytechnic Institute contains 1,262 volumes. This collection includes sets of the Index Kewensis Plantarum Phanerogamarum, of the NatÃ¼rlichen Pflanzen-Familien, and of the Kryptogamen-Flora by Rabenhorst; the reports of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, of the Jardin Botanique de Buitenzorg in Java, of the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis, of the New York Botanical Garden, and of the United States National Herbarium; and the following serials (a number, however, being incomplete): American Botanist, American Fern Journal, American Journal of Botany, Botanical Abstracts, Botanical Gazette, Botanical Review, Botanische Zeitung, Botanisches Zentralblatt, Butler University Botanical Studies, California University Publications in Botany, Deutschen Botanische Gesellschaft, Dutch East Indies, Instituut voor Plantenziekten, Mededeelingen, Florida, State Plant Board, Circulars, Monthly Bulletin, Quarterly Bulletin, Reports, Insecutor Inscitiae Menstruus, Jahresbericht Ã¼ber die Fortschritte in der Lehre von den GÃ¤rungs-Gebiete der Pflanzenkrankheiten, Journal of Mycology, Minnesota Botanical Studies, Minnesota Plant Studies, Botanical Series of the Geological and Natural History Survey of Minnesota, Montreal University Contributions du Laboratorie de Botanique, Mycologia, New Phytologist, North American Flora, Pennsylvania University Botanical Laboratory Contributions, Phytopathology, Plant Physiology, Plant World, Revue GÃ©nÃ©ral de Botanique, Rhodora, Royal Botanic Club, Notes, SociÃ©tÃ© Mycologique de France, Bulletin, Southern Appalachian Botanical Club, Journal, Torrey Botanical Club, Bulletin, Wyoming University Publications in Science, Botany, Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Botanik, Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Pflanzenkrankheiten. At the University of Virginia Library there are approximately 1,800 volumes in botany, the majority being books, not serials. Some of the earlier works are represented; there are Engler's Das Pflanzenreich, the Index Kewensis, the NatÃ¼rlichen Pflanzen-Familien, and Rabenhorst's Kryptogamen-Flora; and the publications of the Arnold Arboretum at Harvard University, of the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis, of the New York Botanical Garden, of the Jardin Botanico of Rio de Janeiro, and of the United States National Herbarium are currently received. A general collection in botany is maintained at the College of William and Mary. At the time this survey record was taken the collection consisted of 575 volumes. Of volumes in ZOOLOGY the University of Virginia has approximately 2,400. This is a general collection with some early works, such as Buffon's Histoire Naturelle (both in the original and in translation); with several monumental sets, for example, Audubon's Birds of America, Bronn's Klassen und Ordnungen der Thier Reichs, and Lankester's Treatise on Zoology; and with a fair representation of reports of marine laboratories, zoological gardens, and zoological serials. For purposes of research the most significant part of the collection probably consists in the material â books, periodicals, and pamphlets â on ornithology, this being largely the gift of J. H. Riley, Esq., of the United States National Museum. The Library at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute contains 1,090 volumes in zoology. This also is a general collection. It includes runs of thirty-eight serial publications, in addition to which there are the reports (chiefly annual) from twenty-two government departments or laboratories. The State Library in Richmond has approximately 1,000 volumes in zoology, the collection being general but with some emphasis on popular zoology and birds. About 200 of the volumes are the publications of state departments of fisheries. Special sets include Audubon's Birds of America, the Cambridge Natural History, Cuvier's Animal Kingdom, Jardine's Naturalist's Library, and Kingsley's Riverside Natural History. Section I. Psychology. In psychology there are about 2,400 volumes at the University of Virginia Library. These include twenty-two periodicals currently received and two or three which are no longer being published, the sets being complete in the majority of cases. The collection deals with general psychology, but there is considerable emphasis on child psychology and on educational psychology. The library at the Randolph-Macon Woman's College contains a total of 1,042 volumes in psychology. There is a good selection of the files of the more important journals, American, English, and German. There are five libraries in Virginia which have collections of about 500 volumes in psychology. These are the Mary Helen Cochran Library at Sweet Briar College, which has 566 volumes, a good working collection for undergraduate study in the history of psychology and in abnormal, animal, child, and physiological psychology; the library of the College of William and Mary, with 520 volumes, showing some special interest in child psychology and in physiological psychology; the libraries at the University of Richmond and at Washington and Lee University, each with about 500 volumes; and the library at the Union Theological Seminary, with 450 volumes, mainly on abnormal psychology, child psychology, and the psychology of religion. Section J. Medicine. There are three medical collections of note in Virginia; the libraries of the Medical College of Virginia and of the Richmond Academy of Medicine, which occupy adjacent buildings and supplement each other; and the library of the medical department of the University of Virginia. Research workers in these libraries have the advantage of proximity to the great Army Medical Library in Washington, which uniformly maintains a high degree of courtesy, generosity, and effectiveness in inter-library loans. The research worker at the Medical College of Virginia can also draw on the science sections of other libraries in Richmond, this process having been expedited by a union list of periodical holdings in nine collections in that city. (See Part One, Section B., Bibliography.* * Pages 4-6. ) In the total of 24,472 volumes recorded for this particular library, however, there are included 2,384 volumes of periodicals in general science (694), physics (89), chemistry (941), general biology (225), botany (192), and zoology (243). This collection, therefore, affords a considerable degree of independence of outside resources. The medical material itself is well distributed over the various fields of medical activity. But the subjects that are perhaps most adequately equipped are general medicine, pathology, practice of medicine, surgery, ophthalmology, gynecology, and therapeutics. There are also strong sections in anatomy, physiology, and bacteriology. Altogether there are files, a fair proportion being complete, of 330 periodicals or society publications, the total number of volumes of serials being in excess of 14,000. The Miller Library of the Richmond Academy of Medicine** ** The collection at the Richmond Academy of Medicine is accessible for research work within the library, but the books are not available for outside loans. contains approximately 3,500 volumes of old medical works (including some incunabula) in Greek, Italian, German, French, and English. In time these works range from the tenth century to the early nineteenth; and in subject they include general medicine, surgery, dentistry, pharmacy, and such allied sciences as nursing. This is a collection of medical books. By a cooperative arrangement medical journals are transferred to the neighbouring library of the Medical College of Virginia. The research worker at the University of Virginia of course has ready access to the various science collections on the same campus. The medical collection itself numbers 17,747 volumes, including files of somewhat over one hundred periodicals. There is also an extensive and carefully filed accumulation of pamphlets and reprints. The collection is general in character, but there is some emphasis on cancer research, dermatology, neurology, radiology, surgery, pediatrics, pathology, physiology, bacteriology, and the history of medicine. In addition to these Richmond and Charlottesville centers for medical books there is at least an interesting suggestion in a special collection in Norfolk. This is maintained by the Norfolk County Medical Society for its members, and consists of approximately 8,000 volumes in medicine, surgery, medical history, and medical biography. Section K. Allied Medical Sciences. In HYGIENE AND STATE MEDICINE the Medical College of Virginia has 2,319 volumes, including government, state, and municipal publications and runs of fifteen periodicals. There are somewhat smaller collections at the University of Virginia and at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. In PHARMACY AND MATERIA MEDICA the collection at the Medical College of Virginia numbers 1,142 volumes, of which 868 are periodicals representing twenty-four titles. The State Library has a collection of 1,617 volumes in these subjects, the proportion of periodicals being, in this case, smaller. The Medical College of Virginia contains 815 volumes on DENTISTRY, of which 382 are miscellaneous textbooks and 443 are serials, nineteen varieties being represented. On the subject of NURSING both the Medical College of Virginia and the University of Virginia have collections of about 300 volumes. The library at the University subscribes to seven periodicals dealing with this subject. IV. TECHNOLOGY Section A. Engineering. There are five fairly extensive collections in Virginia of material on engineering: at the University of Virginia, 8,437 volumes; at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, 6,983 volumes; at the State Library, 6,020 volumes; at the Coast Artillery School, 5,701 volumes; and at the specialized Norfolk and Western Transportation Library, 2,500 books and 3,000 pamphlets, a total of 5,500. Smaller collections are to be found in Lexington, at the Virginia Military Institute and at Washington and Lee University. But as the Engineering School at Washington and Lee has recently been discontinued, further additions will probably not be made to that collection. The Norfolk and Western Railway Transportation Library* * This collection serves as a centralized source of information for the railway company's employees. But persons not connected with the railway are granted opportunity to consult the material within the library in Roanoke. at Roanoke contains material on the economic, geological, and historical phases of transportation as well as on engineering; and attention has been given to air, highway, and water transportation as well as to railways. A considerable part of the collection, however, deals with railway engineering. The material is chiefly in the form of books, pamphlets, and railway reports. There are also a few engineering journals; and there are sets of the proceedings of the American Railway Association and of its Freight Claims Division, of the American Railway Engineering and Maintenance of Way Association, of the American Railway Master Mechanics' Association, of the Master Car Builders' Association, and of the Railway Stockkeepers' Association. In the collection at the Coast Artillery School at Fort Monroe the emphasis is on electrical, mechanical, and military engineering. There are runs of eighteen journals, the more complete files being those of the Journal of the Franklin Institute, the Military Engineer, the Scientific American, the Transactions of the American Society of Civil Engineers, and the Transactions of the Society of Mechanical Engineers. At the State Library, city and state reports and United States serial publications form about two-thirds of the collection. The points of stress are hydraulic, mining, railway, and highway engineering. There are sets of twenty journals; several of these, such as the American Railroad Journal, the Artizan, the Journal of the Franklin Institute, and the Journal of the Society of Arts, London, go back to the first half of the nineteenth century. There is some material on the history of engineering. The collection at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute covers practically all types of engineering, as may be seen by an enumeration of the volumes in each branch: aeronautical engineering, 281 volumes; agricultural engineering, 109; architectural engineering (including volumes on architecture), 741; ceramic engineering, 81; chemical engineering (not including theoretical chemistry), 512; civil engineering, 1,191; electrical engineering, 978; general engineering, 714; graphics, 124; industrial engineering, 438; mechanical engineering, 1,091; mining engineering, 723; the grand total being 6,983 volumes. Of engineering periodicals and society proceedings there are 134 different titles. The collection includes about thirty volumes of engineering history and about twenty volumes of engineering biography. There is a complete set of the Transactions of the Newcomen Society which deal mainly with the history of engineering and of technology. At the University of Virginia also the collection covers all branches; but there is emphasis on civil, electrical, mechanical, and chemical engineering. There are files of 307 engineering serials, of which ninety-five are currently received. The sets of the following are complete: Proceedings of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the Refrigerating Data Book of the American Society of Refrigerating Engineers, the Automatic Electric Review, the Bell System Technical Journal, the Bell Telephone Quarterly, Civil Engineering, Communication and Broadcast Engineering, Electrical Maintenance, the Transactions of the Illuminating Engineering Society, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, the Transactions of the Institution of Chemical Engineers, the Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, the Engineering Research Bulletin of the Department of Engineering Research of the University of Michigan, the Contributed Technical Papers on Stratospheres of the National Geographic Society, the Bulletin Series of the Engineering Experiment Station of the Oregon Agricultural College, Television, published by the R.C.A. Institute, Inc., the Series of Monograms on Electrical Engineering published in Great Britain, the Strowger Technical Journal, and the Publications of the School of Engineering of Yale University. Section B. Military and Naval Science. As is to be expected, the largest collection in Virginia of books on military science is at the Coast Artillery School at Fort Monroe, Old Point Comfort. On military and naval science combined there are 10,469 volumes, but by far the major part deals with military science, with emphasis on artillery. As an indication of the research possibilities in the history of military science, a dozen volumes may be listed from the collection; namely, A. Bell's Treatise on the Art of War, 1803; Gaspard H. Cotty's EncyclopÃ©die Methodique, Dictionnaire de l'Artillerie, 1822; Cugnot's Elemens de l'Art Militaire Ancien et Moderne, 1766; Etat Actuel de l'Art et de la Science Militaire Ã  la Chine, 1773; Friedrich II der Grosse, Military Instructions, 1762; Earl Orrery's Treatise on the Art of War, 1677; PrÃ©jugÃ©s Militaires, par un Officier Autrichien, 1783; Puysegur's Art de la Guerre, 1748; Duc de Rohan, Le Parfait Capitaine, 1648; Maurice Saxe, Mes Reveries, 1757; Comte Turpin's Essai sur l'Art de la Guerre, 1754; and R. Ward's Animadversions of Warre, 1639. The plentiful sprinkling of foreign material in this collection may be noted in this sample list; other evidences appear in the fact that of eighty-two runs of military periodicals fifty-seven are foreign, and of eighteen runs of naval periodicals thirteen are foreign. As is also to be expected, the collection numbering as a whole nearly 20,000 volumes (See Part Two, III Science, Section C., Geography.* * Page 56. ) at the Mariners' Museum Library is especially strong in its section on naval science. In fact here is a high point in the story of research possibilities in Virginia. Some suggestion as to the quality of the material may be gained from a brief list of titles of works published before 1750:- L'Art de Batir les Vaisseaux, et d'en Perfectionner la Construc- tion ... Amsterdam, 1719. Bouguer, Pierre. Traite du Navire, de sa Construction, et de ses Mouvemens. Paris, 1746. Dassie. L'Architecture Navale, Contenant la ManiÃ¨re de Construire les Navires, Galeres, et Chaloupses ... Paris, 1677. [Dee, John] General and Rare Memorials Pertayning to the Perfect Arte of Navigation. [London, 1577] Euler, Leonhard. Scientia Navalis ... St. Petersburg, 1749. Furtenbach, Joseph. Architectura Navalis. Ulm, 1629. Hoste, Paul. L'Art des Armees Navalis. Lyon, 1697. Hoste, Paul. Theorie de la Construction des Vaisseaux ... Lyon, 1697. Sutherland, William. Britain's Glory; or, Shipbuilding Unvail'd. London, 1740. [Torchet de Boismele, Jean Baptiste] Histoire GÃ©nÃ©rale de la Marine. Paris, 1744. Witsen, Nicholas. Aeloude en Hedendaegsche Scheepsbouw en Bestier. Amsterdam, 1671. Yk, Cornelis van. De Nederlandsche Scheepsbouw-Kunst open Gestelt. Amsterdam, 1697. The publications of the United States Navy Department and of the British Admiralty are fully represented; so are Lloyd's Register of Shipping, Lloyd's Register of Yachts, and Lloyd's Rules and Regulations for the Construction and Classification of Steel Vessels. There are long runs of such journals and society publications as the Record of the American Bureau of Shipping, the Journal of the American Society of Naval Engineers, the Bulletin de Association Technique Maritime, Brassey's Naval and Shipping Annual, the Transactions of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland, the Transactions of the Institution of Naval Engineers, the Mariner's Mirror, the Naval Chronicle, the Navy Records Society, the Journal of the Royal United Service Institution, and the Transactions of the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers. This section on naval science is well supported by bibliographical works and by related material in various branches of science and technology. The State Library contains 1,710 volumes on military science and 1,125 volumes on naval science, a total of 2,835 on these two subjects. This is a general collection. But there is some emphasis on military engineering, on naval architecture, shipbuilding, and navigation, and on medical and sanitary services. Smaller collections may be found at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and at the Virginia Military Institute, the military material being the more extensive in both cases. Of special interest at the Virginia Military Institute is a group of about one hundred books (chiefly in French) from the libraries of Generals Robert E. Lee and Joseph E. Johnston, occasional volumes containing autograph notes. Section C. Agriculture. There are five libraries in Virginia which contain material on agriculture in considerable quantity and of some distinction; namely, the libraries at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, at Hampton Institute, at the State Library, at the University of Virginia, and at the College of William and Mary. There is a very live collection on this subject at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. It covers all fields except tropical agriculture. There are sets of 253 periodicals, eleven of which reach back before 1850. Of the publications of the United States Department of Agriculture, of state departments of agriculture, and of agricultural experiment stations there are 6,500 volumes; and there are about 400 volumes of foreign agricultural publications. The biography and the history of agriculture are represented, and books on travel supplement the historical material. Works on agricultural biology, agricultural chemistry, and agricultural physics also support the main collection. Altogether there are at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute 13,767 volumes in this subject. At Hampton Institute also there is a live collection on agriculture. This is strong in its holdings, a fair proportion being complete, of the publications of the state departments of agriculture and of the agricultural experiment stations. Of these the different titles number 260. The collection offers material on practically all phases of the subject, and numbers altogether 4,794 volumes. The large collection at the State Library numbers 15,563 volumes, of which about 4,500 are publications of state departments of agriculture and of agricultural experiment stations and about 8,700 volumes - practically all that have been issued, in fact - of the publications of the United States Department of Agriculture. The foreign publications represent England, Scotland, France, Italy, and the Philippine Islands. All subjects are represented, including soils and soil conservation. At the University of Virginia itself there are 7,799 volumes on agriculture, and two special libraries located elsewhere supplement the general material. These two are the laboratory libraries at the Blandy Experimental Farm in north-west Virginia, which has several hundred books and over 4,000 pamphlets, with special stress on genetics; and at the Seward Forest in south-east Virginia, which has about 300 books and approximately 1,200 pamphlets on forestry. In addition to the supporting material from the biological sciences, there is, at the University, a collection of 1,986 volumes on rural social economics. A smaller collection at the College of William and Mary affords special interest through a considerable group of eighteenth and nineteenth century works on gardening which were known to and used by the colonial settlers and early planters of America. Section D. Home Economics. The most extensive collection of books on home economics is at Hampton Institute. This contains 674 volumes, including files, none being complete, of American Cookery, the Journal of Home Economics, and Practical Home Economics. At the College of William and Mary there are 395 volumes on this subject and sets of American Cookery, American Home, Forecast, Home Economic News, the Journal of Home Economics, the Parents Magazine, and Vogue. This library has a number of volumes of early cook-books used in Virginia. Among other collections in Virginia are those at the University of Virginia (382 volumes), at the State Teachers College at Fredericksburg (377 volumes), at the Richmond Public Library (375 volumes), and at the State Library (305 volumes). Section E. Textiles. The collections on textiles are still smaller. What is apparently the largest is at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, and consists of seventy-nine volumes, including sets of Kunstseide, Rayon, and the Textile World. At the Farmville State Teachers College there are sixty-five volumes, at the State Library sixty-three volumes including three periodicals), at the Fredericksburg State Teachers College sixty volumes, and at the Richmond Public Library forty-three volumes. Sweet Briar College has an historical collection of sample textiles in its art department. V. SPECIAL COLLECTIONS The list which follows is of special collections within libraries. It does not include special libraries such as the Library of Colonial Williamsburg, Incorporated, the Colonial National Historical Park Library at Yorktown, the Mariners' Museum Library, the Library of the Virginia Historical Society, the Transportation Library of the Norfolk and Western Railway at Roanoke, or the James Taylor Adams Library at Big Laurel. The collections are listed with little if any description; and it is altogether probable that the list is quite incomplete. It will again be noted that in the bibliothocal lexicon of this Commonwealth a favourite term is `Virginiana'. Alexandria ALEXANDRIA PUBLIC LIBRARY.

      <field name="fulltext">SUMMARY If anyone has possessed the endurance to read this survey through, there is no need to summarize for him the research situation in Virginia. But even though the genus librarian is apparently a hardy stock, it seems advisable to append a summary, with perhaps a word or two of generalization. A merely casual examination of the foregoing pages will reveal in every division lists of six or eight or ten libraries with collections which often do not vary greatly in size. In most cases a majority of these are college or university libraries. Attention has naturally been focused on these rather than on public library collections, since even in such effective public libraries as those in Richmond, Norfolk, Roanoke, Lynchburg, Petersburg, Winchester, or Newport News the emphasis on research will probably continue to be largely incidental. But what has not emerged into visibility on these pages is the fact that the roll of the college libraries could readily have been doubled or tripled â with embarrassing and distressing indications of the inadequacy of the book collections in the lower ranges of the lists. The suspicion that Virginia is overstocked with colleges is strengthened by library tests. The natural conclusion that the state's book budgets are being too much expended for duplication of commonplace items, and that concentration on fewer libraries would work benefit to research possibilities is obvious. But it is also quite unrealistic as a solution. In the words of a former President of the United States, this is a condition and not a theory that confronts us. We have the colleges with us; and being colleges, their libraries must not be permitted to starve. To readjust existing budgets so as to afford greater emphasis on book collections and their administration would be drastic, but it would also undoubtedly be educational statesmanship. To this generalization it may be objected that it has no legitimate place in a survey of research materials; that college libraries are for undergraduates and that no pretense is made to offer research possibilities. That fact may readily be granted. And it is certainly no thesis of this survey that superstructures of research should be reared on inadequate foundations. But quite aside from the more immediate injury to the undergraduates and their teachers from the meagre book collections that are to be found too frequently in Virginia, there is involved injury to research also. Research collections are the tools of the trade for trained scholars. In these latter days trained scholars do not spring full-grown from a Jovian headache. They must patiently learn to read and to use books. Lack of the essential means may even prevent latent scholarship from ever realizing its powers. A well chosen and a well administered college book collection is a constant means of attraction and stimulus â it is a vital asset to a college and to the development of scholarship. To cramp and retard scholarly impulses at their origin is poor service to this Commonwealth. But for the libraries which have emerged on to the lists in the foregoing pages there can be a different verdict. In them there is much of promise and something of real achievement. The record is for the academic year 1936-37. That record has already slipped back from `present conditions' to `recent history.' There is much matter for satisfaction that the generous cooperation exhibited during this survey has brought to librarians the compensation of a clearer knowledge of their own collections. This knowledge is already bringing forth fruit in planned and systematic growth. That the present survey should by no means be regarded as the conclusion of the whole matter is a distinct reason for encouragement. To sum up, then. In the general classes there are noteworthy collections at the State Library, at the University of Virginia, at the College of William and Mary, at Sweet Briar, at Randolph-Macon Woman's College, at the University of Richmond. Much remains to be done in the accumulation of general bibliographic items; and of adequate foreign material there is a common lack. But in its manuscript collections Virginia can claim notable research possibilities, particularly in Richmond, in Charlottesville, and in Williamsburg. For their collections in the humanities mention should be made of the University of Virginia, of the State Library, of William and Mary, of Randolph-Macon Woman's College, of Sweet Briar, of Washington and Lee, of Hampton Institute. The most noticeable weakness is in modern languages such as Italian and French. There is strength in classical languages, English, fine arts, architecture, philosophy; and in religion the Union Theological Seminary and the Episcopal Theological Seminary afford undoubted opportunities for research. In social sciences there are commendable collections at the State Library, the University of Virginia, William and Mary, Washington and Lee, the University of Richmond, Randolph-Macon Woman's College, and Hampton Institute. There is more or less general weakness in anthropology and ethnology, in mediaeval history, and in Latin American, African, Asiatic, and Oceanic history. Other sections in history, particularly American history, are much more adequate; and so are the materials in education, and in commerce and economics. There are fair collections in law at the State Law Library and at the University of Virginia. In science the strongest collections are at the University of Virginia and at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute. The subjects most adequately equipped are perhaps astronomy, chemistry, geography, geology, and psychology. The specialized collections at the Coast Artillery School and at the Mariners' Museum are a boon to research in Virginia; and the Medical College of Virginia and the Medical Library at the University of Virginia have made a promising start in the collection of materials on medicine. In technology the libraries at the University of Virginia, the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the Mariners' Museum, the Coast Artillery School, Hampton Institute, and the College of William and Mary deserve mention. The main strength is in agriculture, engineering, and military and naval science. The material in home economics and textiles is wide spread but is not very important. The largest collections in Virginia are at the State Library and at the University of Virginia. The former has a truly remarkable range for a library of the character conventionally attributed to a state library. On the latter falls the main responsibility for supporting graduate work on the Ph.D. level; and in the doubling of the size of its combined collections during the past eleven years there has been an earnest effort to meet this responsibility. This survey deals with books, not buildings. But that there is a more adequate library building in process of erection at the University of Virginia and that there is immediate hope of a similar new building for the State Library are items of significance. Such, then, is this 1936-37 survey of the research possibilities in Virginia libraries. It has been an attempt at reality. It shows cause not for boasting nor for discouraged resignation but for persistent effort.</field>
