      <field name="fulltext">Announcements. 1895-'96. The University of Virginia is in a picturesque and healthy location among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railwayâthe Chesapeake and Ohio, and the Virginia Midlandâand it is thus of easy access from every part of the country. It has a post-office, with numerous daily mails, is in communication by telephone with the neighboring city of Charlottesville, and is connected by telegraph with every quarter of the world. The climate is invigorating and healthful, and at all times free from malarial conditions. The Sanitary Arrangements are excellent. The water-supply is pure; the system of drains and sewers is complete; the new Fayerweather Gymnasium affords ample facilities for bathing and exercise; and the moderate Infirmary fee secures medical treatment by the Professors of the Medical Department, and in case of serious illness skillful nursing in a well-equipped Infirmary. The Session begins on the 15th of September, and continues nine months. On Public Day, which is the Wednesday before the 19th of June, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers and Students of the University assemble in the Public Hall, whither the public also are invited. On this occasion the results of the examinations are announced, degrees are conferred, and the session is formally closed. The Courses of Instruction are comprised in six departmentsâthe Academical, the Engineering, the Law, the Medical, the Pharmaceutical, and the Agricultural Department. In the various departments there are altogether twenty-two distinct Schools, each affording an independent course, under Professors who are responsible only to the Visitors for the systems and methods pursued. Elective System.âThe system of independent Schools assumes that opportunities for study and instruction are privileges to be sought voluntarily and eagerly. Students are therefore allowed to elect for themselves the courses of study to which they are led by their individual tastes and proposed pursuits in life, so far as the times appointed for lectures and examinations permit. Nor is it alone to those who wish to make special attainments in single departments of knowledge that this freedom of election commends itself. It has serious advantages also for most of those students who seek the common goal of liberal education by ways which varying aptitude, varying preparation, or varying opportunities render of necessity different. The wisdom of the founder in establishing such a system has been amply vindicated in the history of this University; and in recent years many schools of higher education in the United States have adopted methods involving this principle. Equipment.âThe equipment possessed by the University for the work of instruction, both in the Academical and the Professional Departments, has been much augmented in recent years, and is now excellent in quality, as well as extensive. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Leander McCormick Observatory, the Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, the Biological Laboratory and the Pathological Laboratory. Ample opportunities are afforded for the practical study of Human Anatomy. The Engineering Department possesses a newly equipped Mechanical Laboratory and Machine Shop. The University Library is common to all the Departments; originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, it has been since much enlarged by purchases and donations, and now contains about 53,000 volumes. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the Librarian is present in the Library for six hours daily to attend to their wants. Preparation.âSome special preparation for the courses taught in the Schools of Latin, Greek, Modern Languages and Mathematics will be found indispensable. But even for these Schools it is more important that the preliminary studies should have been careful and accurate in quality than that they should be extensive. For the other Schools the essentials of a plain education in the common school branches constitute the only indispensable preparation. In all the Schools alike, however, the student who has had the benefit of mental training, and who brings with him good and well-established habits of study, will derive increased profit from the University instruction because of these advantages. But it has never been the policy of the University to reject any student merely because of deficient preparation in special branches of learning, which he may not wish to pursue here. The standards of teaching and of examination can be otherwise maintained; and experience has shown in a multitude of instances that young men of vigorous mind and earnest purpose of diligence, brought hither by a laudable ambition to excel, may overcome the disadvantages of inadequate training, and become conspicuous among their fellows for success in study. Admission.âTo be admitted as a student of the University the applicant must be at least sixteen years of age; but the Faculty may dispense with this requirement. If the applicant has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he must produce a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence of general good conduct. Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or not. They strictly forbid drunkenness, gaming, dissoluteness, swearing, habits of expense, and the introduction of wine or other intoxicating drinks into the University. They require a decorous observance of Sunday, and forbid all outdoor sports on that day. They forbid the use or possession by a student of pistols or other weapons, and the introduction of them into the University precincts. They require from the student regular and diligent application to his studies, and if, in the opinion of the Faculty, any student be not fulfilling the purposes for which he ought to have come to the University, and be not likely to fulfil them, either from habitual delinquency in any of his classes, or from habitual idleness, or from any other bad habit, the Faculty may require him to withdraw from the University, after informing him of the objections to his conduct and affording him an opportunity of explanation and defence. Discipline and Religious Worship.âMorality and religion are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline of the University is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity, and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience having proved that it is best to forbear the employment of coercion, the attendance on religious exercises is entirely voluntary. Prayers are held every morning in the Chapel, and divine service is conducted twice on Sunday by a Chaplain, selected in turn from the principal religious denominations. Entrance examinations are not required except from Academical students from Virginia seeking free tuition. The requirement for these examitions are stated elsewhere. But applicants for admission to the different classes in the several Schools are expected to exhibit to the Professors suitable evidences of adequate preliminary training. The method of instruction in all departments of the University is partly by lecture, partly by the study of appropriate texts. The regulations require that at each meeting the Professor shall examine the class orally on the subject-matter of the previous lecture before beginning the new lecture. Associated with this instruction in the class is a large amount of practical laboratory work in the scientific courses, and of private parallel reading and essay writing in the literary courses. The examinations in each class are twoâone about the middle of the session, the other near the end. They are in writing, and the standard is in no case less than three-fourths. A student who attains this standard is entitled to a PASS-CERTIFICATE. The examinations in each School are conducted by a committee of the Faculty, of which the Professor in charge is chairman. No special examination is granted, except upon the physician's certificate of sickness on the day of examination, or other cause which the Faculty may accept as adequate ground. Candidates for graduation are subjected to searching interrogations on the specific details as well as on the general principles of the subject, and are expected to be accurately versed in all matters treated in the lectures, the correlative text, and the prescribed courses of private reading. Moreover, the student's command of English, and his standing at the daily oral examinations, as well as at the written examinations, are taken into the account. Reports.âAt the end of each month a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from lectures and examinations, together with such other information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate, or as the parent or guardian may especially request. Parents and guardians cannot be too earnest or prompt in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly reports may suggest. Degrees are conferred only upon examination after residence. Diplomas of graduation are conferred in the B. A. course of each Academical School, and students who complete both the B. A. and the M. A. course in any School are entitled to a diploma of graduation in the School. The titled degrees conferred are Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, Doctor of Philosophy, Civil Engineer, Mining Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Doctor of Medicine, Graduate in Pharmacy, and Bachelor of Law. The requirements for these degrees are given under the several departments. No purely honorary degree is ever given by the University of Virginia. Licentiates.âAny person of unexceptional character and habits, upon producing to the Faculty satisfactory evidence of suitable capacity and attainments, may be licensed by the Faculty to form classes for private instruction in any School of the University, in aid of and in conformity to the public teachings of the Professor upon any subject taught therein. The employment, selection and compensation of such Licentiate is left to the determination of the student. Students whose preparation is defective for the work of the University classes may often economize time and energy by securing the services of a Licentiate at the same time that they are attending the regular course of lectures.</field>

First Year.âA student who is able to translate CÃ¦sar or Vergil, and has a proper acquaintance with the Forms, is prepared to enter this course, which begins with Sallust or a writer of like difficulty. Systematic attention is given to the study of the Forms. The syntactical work is the study of the Case-relations, the exact force of the Tenses, and a consecutive outline of the connections in which the Subjunctive Mood is required. Principles and facts explained are applied by frequent exercises in Latin Composition. The reading is confined to selected portions of Sallust, Ovid, Curtius, and Vergil. A limited amount from each author is prescribed for private reading. For the examinations, passages are selected for translation from the Latin assigned as private reading. There are two examinationsâthe Intermediate, held about the middle of the session; the Final, near its close. These examinations are conducted in writing. B. Second Year.âThe work of this year will be directed to the acquirement of readiness in translation and syntactical interpretation, with as little specialistic investigation as is consistent with a general but sound and permanent knowledge of the language. As an indispensable auxiliary to this end, written exercises in translating English into Latin and Latin into English will be required. Proper attention will be given to Roman History and Literature. The metrical work will be limited to the structure and accurate recitation of the Dactylic, AnapÃ¦stic, Trochaic, and Iambic verses, with the verses occurring in the odes of Horace. Translation will be confined to Livy, Horace, Cicero, Seneca, and Tacitus. Selections from each author will be assigned as parallel reading. There will be two written examinationsâIntermediate and Final. The student who completes the work of this year will be entitled to a diploma of graduation in the B. A. course in Latin. M. A. COURSE. This course commences with Juvenal or Livy, and includes selected portions of Juvenal, Livy, Cicero, Seneca, Tacitus, and Plautus. The Case-relations are reviewed, and the Syntax of the Verb is systematically presented. Latin versification is taken up early in the session and continued throughout the term. A theoretical acquaintance with this subject is insufficient. Prompt identification and correct recitation of every variety of Latin verse is insisted upon. A very prominent place is assigned to Latin Composition as an indispensable means of acquiring an exact knowledge of the language. Portions of the authors read in the lecture-room are designated as parallel and private reading. The object of parallel reading is to enable a student to acquire a more copious vocabulary than is furnished by the limited amount of Latin read in the lecture-room, and to afford a wider field for the application of the principles explained in the lectures. In this class there are two examinationsâ one occurring about the middle of the session, the other near its close. The examinations are conducted in writing. For the second or Final examination, passages for translation are selected partly from the parallel and partly from Latin which the class has not read. In Roman History and Literature the work is that of the B. A. course. The completion of the work of this year entitles the student to the diploma of graduation in the M. A. course in Latin, if the work of the B. A. course has been completed. Text-Books.âAny approved edition of the authors above named. Grammars.âGildersleeve's, Syntax of the Verb by the Professor, Printed Lectures by the Professor on the Latin Cases and Versification. History.âLiddell's, with Long's or any approved Atlas. Literature.âBender's, as a Hand-book and Guide, supplemented by Lectures. PH. D. COURSE. This course is intended for students who propose to teach, or desire to equip themselves for original investigation in the language. The scope of the work is such as to familiarize them with the language in its several periods. An extensive course of reading is prescribed, and subjects for independent investigation are from time to time assigned. The lecture-room exercises consist in translation and the discussion by the student of the passage translated. He is invited to propound such questions to the Professor, or to a member of the class, as he would to a pupil. In addition, a careful translation from some one of the best Latin prose writers is prepared, and the student is required at once to write on the blackboard his Latin rendering of it, and to give his reasons as well for the periods as for the syntactical constructions employed. Though it requires at least two years to complete this course, yet one year given to it abundantly repays the student, as the greater part of the first year of the course is devoted to the Archaic period of the language, which cannot be considered to any great extent in the under-graduate course. SCHOOL OF GREEK. Professor Humphreys. In this School there are three courses: I. A general course, comprising what is deemed essential to a liberal classical education. This course extends over two years. A. First Year Class.âAs a preparation for this class an accurate knowledge of the regular Attic inflections and some experience in translating are necessary. A thorough study of two books of Xenophon's Anabasis may be regarded as the minimum of preparatory reading. The work of the class is directed to the acquirement of practical familiarity with the simpler Attic prose. The Grammar is carefully reviewed, and weekly exercises, based on Greek authors, are written. The authors read are Xenophon and Lysias. B. Second Year Class.âThis class, for which the work of the preceding year, or some equivalent, is the appropriate preparation, continues the study of Attic prose, and enters upon the study of Epic and Ionic Greek and the Drama. The Syntax is reviewed, and weekly exercises are given for translation into Attic prose. The authors read are Plato, Demosthenes, Euripides, Herodotus and Homer. Instruction is given in History, Literature, Antiquities, and the simpler Metres. Graduation in this course is prescribed for those who select Greek as one of their studies for the degree of B. A. II. An advanced course, adapted especially to the requirements of those who desire to become teachers of the classics. It extends through one session of nine months. For admission to this course, graduation in the preceding course is required; but, when sufficiently prepared, students may be allowed to pursue both courses simultaneously. In this course the Syntax of the Verb is thoroughly studied, and weekly exercises, including passages from modern English authors, are given to be translated into idiomatic Greek. Lectures are given on Rhythm and Metres, and the students are practiced in reading rhythmically the lyric parts of the Drama and the works of the Lyric Poets. The authors read are Demosthenes, Ãschylus, Sophocles, Aristophanes, Thucydides, Pindar, and other Lyric Poets. The course will be varied and modified as occasion may require. Graduation in this course is prescribed for those who select Greek as one of their studies for the degree of M. A. III. A special course designed for those who wish to devote themselves to classical scholarship. For admission to this course, graduation in the preceding course is required, but in special cases students may be permitted to prosecute both courses at the same time. The work of this course will be adapted to the special aims of those pursuing it, but will, in all cases, include extensive reading of Greek authors and minute study of some branch of Greek philology. Those who select Greek as one of their studies for the degree of Ph. D. will be required to pursue this course for two years. In all the courses private reading is prescribed, and the examinations will be partly upon this and the work done in class, and partly upon passages selected from the Greek authors at will. Text-Books.âGoodwin's Greek Grammar; Goodwin's Moods and Tenses; Hogue's Irregular Verbs; Veitch's Verbs; Liddell and Scott's Lexicon (Intermediate, and in courses II. and III., unabridged seventh edition); Smith's History of Greece; Jebb's Primer of Greek Literature. Any editions of Greek authors may be used, except when particular ones are specially prescribed; but students should always have at hand Teubner's texts for reference, and for use on examinations. At present Rhythm and Metres and some other subjects are taught wholly or partly by lecture. Hebrew.âElementary instruction in Hebrew will be given when the demand for such instruction is sufficient. SCHOOL OF MODERN LANGUAGES. Spanish, Italian, and Anglo-Saxon. Professor Schele De Vere. There will be hereafter three courses in each of the two languages, Spanish and Italian. The Collegiate Course, containing the work required for the degree of Bachelor of Arts, begins with lectures, recitals, and readings on the part of the class, calculated to teach practically the pronunciation of the idiom. This is followed by a series of lectures, abundantly illustrated on the blackboard, and by frequent exercises on the subjects explained, which are expected to familiarize the student gradually with the elements of Grammar and Syntax. As soon as this is accomplished, he is set to work translating first an easy Reader, and soon a simple, native writer. He is expected, at the same time, to read privately a number of prescribed authors, and thus to make himself familiar with the language, to increase, easily and steadily, his stock of words, and to enable him, after some practice, to take up any not exceptionally difficult writer, and to translate his works without assistance. The University Course for the Master of Arts degree begins at once with advanced work in the language chosen with a view to securing the degree of M. A. In the University Course sufficient preliminary knowledge of the language (Spanish or Italian) is expected to enable the student at once to begin translating into idiomatic English any one of the classic writers in those languages. This is continued till the off-hand translation meets no longer with practical or purely etymological difficulties. Such readings, like Dante's Inferno or Petrarch's Sonnets, or the Romances of the Cid and Calderon's Autos, are accompanied by exercises, specially and carefully prepared to teach the idioms of either language, and to facilitate the oral use as much as natural gifts may justify the Professor in expecting from the student. The treatment of either language now becomes purely historical, calculated to enable the student to read in its changes the mental and moral development of the race from its infancy to its highest success in speech and in literature. This part of the course naturally includes a series of lectures on the fundamental laws of the science of Comparative Philology, and these are accompanied by others on the lives and the works of the leading authors, which are carefully examined and criticised. The Post-Graduate Course in Spanish and Italian is mainly a continuation of the studies pursued in the Master of Arts course, and is designed specifically to meet the needs of candidates for the Ph. D. degree. A general knowledge of the subject being vouched for, certain subjects of interest are selected, which are to be thoroughly investigated, sustained by an abundance of examples taken from classic writers in the language chosen, and either proven or disproven, as the candidate for the degree may select. As a tangible evidence of the work actually done by the student, he is expected to hand in a Monthly Essay, giving the results of his studies, and proving independent and original research. His special attention may thus be directed to the mutual influence which literatureâpowerful and effective writingsâmay exercise on the fate of a people, and which the history of the nation, on the other hand, exerts over its great authors and their works. In this course the study of the great masters in the Science of Language, Diez, Grimm, Max MÃ¼ller, Sayce, Hovelacque, Thierry, and others, becomes imperative, and the great principles of this young and fascinating Science furnish the most desirable objects of study. Language now becomes to the student a living being, having a history of its own, and suggesting entirely new and interesting questions, such as how far language may or may not be subject to the laws of evolution. It will be the aim of this Post-Graduate Course to arouse in the student a lively and productive interest in Language as a living organism rather than a mere mechanism, and at the same time to equip him with all the arms he will need when he enters the great arena of the world as a valiant champion of one or the other great doctrine that still awaits decision. In the Class of Anglo-Saxon the study of the language is mainly pursued in its aspect as the mother of English, furnishing the student the means of tracing the history of his native tongue from its earliest beginning. Much attention is given to the illustration of the history of words, their birth, their fate under the rule of the Norman, and their subsequent modification. Extracts from Anglo-Saxon writers are read, and the bearing of their works on the history of our race is explained. The following text-books are used: Spanish.âThe Professor's Grammar; Seoane's Dictionary; Velasquez's Reader; Calderon's El Principe Constante; Lope's Estrella de Sevilla; Cervantes' Don Quijote; Galdos' Trafalgar; Caballero's La Familia de Alvareda; Cervantes' Novelas Ejemplares; Ticknor's History of Spanish Literature. Italian.âCuore's or Grandgent's Grammar; Foresti's Reader; Manzoni's I Promessi Sposi; Tasso's Gerusalemme Liberata; Pellico's Le Mie Prigioni; Petrarca; Dante's La Divina Commedia; del Testa's L'Oro et L'Orpello. Anglo-Saxon.âShute's Manual of Anglo-Saxon, or Sweet's Primer; The Professor's Studies in English; March's Anglo-Saxon Grammar (for reference); the Anglo-Saxon Gospels; Bosworth's Anglo-Saxon Dictionary. French and German. Adjunct Professor Perkinson. Acting Professor Reinhard. There are three courses in each language. B. A. COURSE. Students who desire to enter this must possess an accurate knowlege of the elements of English grammar, and some familiarity with the rudiments of the language studied, or in lieu thereof a careful training in Latin. They will study the grammar of the language, and will be practiced in pronunciation, on which special stress will be laid, and in translation, supplemented by weekly written exercises, copious parallel reading, and a course in the history and the literature of the language. The amount of parallel reading to be done is definite, and is assigned at the beginning of the session. Special attention is paid to reading at sight. M. A. COURSE. This embraces the historical grammar of the language, given by lectures, continued practice in translation and composition, and the minute study of certain authors and selected periods. Candidates for graduation will be expected to translate at sight any passage that may be assigned, and to render selections from English authors into the foreign idiom. PH. D. COURSE. This is designed for students who wish to make a special study of the literature or the philology of French and German. Only those who have been graduated in the lower courses are admitted to it. The work will be adapted to the aims of the student, but will in all cases be designed to encourage and direct him to original research, independent conclusions, and systematic presentation of results. The text-books in all the classes, and the authors to be read, vary from year to year, and are subject to change at any time. The following are the books for the class-work in 1895-'96. Parallel reading will be assigned in all classes at the beginning of the session. B. A. French.âWhitney's Grammar and Introductory French Reader; About's Le Roi des Montagnes; Souvestre's Confessions d'un Ouvrier; Racine's Esther; MoliÃ¨re's Le Misanthrope; Contes de Balzac. B. A. German.âWhitney's Brief Grammar; Joynes-Meissner's Grammar; Joynes's German Reader; Hauff's Das Wirthshaus im Spessart; Schiller's Wilhelm Tell; Goethe's Hermann und Dorothea. M. A. French.âWhitney's Grammar for reference; Racine's Andromaque, Britannicus, PhÃ¨dre, Athalie; Victor Hugo's Travailleurs de la Mer. M. A. German.âWhitney's Grammar for reference; Riehl's Culturgeschichtliche Novellen; Goethe's Faust; Scheffel's Ekkehard; Lessing's Nathan der Weise. Gasc's French Dictionary. Adler's German Dictionary. Students who elect this School for the M. A. degree will be required to graduate in German and one of the Romance Languages. SCHOOL OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. Professor Garnett. B. A. COURSE. Modern English.âIn this class the study of the English drama and of the descriptive history of the language is pursued; Shakspere is made a special subject of study. The critical study of one or two plays of Shakspere, with private reading of about one-fourth of the plays, is followed by similar study of selected works of other dramatic authors. Lectures on the history of the Elizabethan drama are given in connection with the study of Shakspere. These treat the early dramatic forms prevalent in Englandâ i. e., the Mysteries, Moralities and Interludes; the rise of regular comedy and tragedy as seen in Ralph Royster Doyster and Gorboduc; the Pre-Shaksperian dramatists, Lyle, Peele, Greene and Marlowe; the Shaksperian period, including Shakspere, Ben Jonson, Beaumont and Fletcher, and Webster; and the Post-Shaksperian dramatists to the closing of the theatres in 1642. The study of the English drama occupies the first half-session; that of the history of English, treated from an elementary point of view, the second half-session. The course closes with the reading of some work, usually of Chaucer, in practical illustration of the formation of English. The aim is to give such a knowledge of the history of the language as every educated man should possess. Three lectures a week. Text-Books.âFor 1895-'96, Twelfth Night (Rolfe's edition); Tancock's or Ward's Old English Drama; Dowden's Shakspere Primer; Abbott's Shaksperian Grammar; Champneys's History of English; Skeat's Primer of English Etymology; Chaucer's Prologue and Knight's Tale; Pollard's Chaucer Primer. For Reference.âThe Globe Shakspere; Fleay's Life of Shakspere; Fleay's History of the Stage, 1559-1642; Halliwell-Phillips's Life of Shakspere; Keltie's British Dramatists; Emerson's History of the English Language; Skeat's Student's Chaucer. M. A. COURSE. Old and Middle English.âIn this class the historical and philological study of the language is pursued, the class beginning with its oldest forms and tracing the language, by the study of specimens, through its different periods to the formation of modern English. After a thorough study of the grammar, selected pieces of Old and Middle English prose and poetry are read, with a view to acquiring a philological knowledge of the origin and structure of English. Lectures on the position of English in the Indo-European family of languages, and on the history of the language, are also given. These treat in outline the other branches of the Indo-European family of languages, and in detail the Teutonic branch. Special stress is laid upon the development of the language during the Old and Middle English periods, and the infusion of the Romance elements which so greatly affected its character. The study of Old English (Anglo-Saxon) occupies the first half-session; that of Middle English, the second half-session. In addition to what is read in class, assigned parallel reading of Old and Middle English works is also required. It is well for the student to have studied the history of English as given in the class of Modern English, or some similar course, before entering upon the study of the course in Old and Middle English, although this is not essential, as the two may be studied together. Some antecedent philological study is, however, necessary. The aim is to lay the foundation for more advanced studies in English Philology. Three lectures a week. Text-Books.âBright's Anglo-Saxon Reader; Morris and Skeat's Specimens of Early English, Parts I. and II.; Cook's Sievers's Grammar of Old English; Earle's Anglo-Saxon Literature. For Reference.âTen Brink's Early English Literature; Brooke's History of Early English Literature; Skeat's Principles of English Etymology, First and Second Series; Henry's Comparative Grammar of English and German. PH. D. COURSE. This course is arranged to suit the needs of those students who desire to pursue further their work in English Philology. It will comprise the further study of Old and Middle English works, especially of Old English poetry, and the study of Gothic and the comparative grammar of the Teutonic languages. In addition to such examinations as may seem advisable, a dissertation will be required, giving evidence of independent private study of some subject cognate with the course pursued. The selection of the course and subject is left to the student himself under the guidance of the Professor. The completion of the M. A. Course in Old and Middle English is absolutely necessary to the prosecution of the Ph. D. Course, and a knowledge of German is desirable. The course this session has included the reading of the Exodus and Daniel, Andreas and Elene, Judith, and Beowulf; and the study of Wright's Gothic Language Primer, with additional readings in Skeat's Gothic Gospel of St. Mark and Braune's Gothic Grammar. LINDEN KENT MEMORIAL SCHOOL OF ENGLISH LITERATURE. Professor Kent. Experience has shown that of the large number who elect English Literature as one of their studies here, a few are prepared to do work even more advanced than that offered in the B. A. Course, some are able to accomplish successfully, but without ease, the work assigned, and many find it too difficult. It seems advisable, therefore, to divide the course, not for the purpose of making graduation materially more difficult, though the nature of the work be slightly changed, but in order to adapt it more closely to the requirements of the students. This division will also enable the instructor to readjust the work and thereby add to its interest and widen its scope. B. A. COURSE. A.âFirst Year. In addition to a certain maturity of mind and general mental training, students who desire to pursue this course with profit should have an accurate knowledge of the principles of English grammar, including orthography, and some knowledge of the elements of rhetoric. Previous practice in composition is well-nigh essential to the successful prosecution of the work of the class, while information about the history and contents of English Literature will add materially to appreciation of the lectures. Three hours a week. In evidence of the successful completion of this course a certificate is awarded. For convenience of presentation, the course is divided as follows: 1. Rhetoric.âThis will comprise a careful study of the principles of style in prose discourse. Particular attention will be paid to frequent written exercises, and to the critical analysis of selected specimens of English prose. Text-Books.âGenung's Practical Rhetoric; Genung's Hand-book of Rhetorical Analysis; Hill's Foundations of Rhetoric. 2. General History of English Literature.âThis course will follow in the main the outline provided by Pancoast's Introduction to English Literature. The text will be prefaced by a few lectures on the development of English literature prior to Chaucer, and be supplemented throughout by explanations, assigned topics for class-study, lectures, etc. Besides the various written exercises of this class, two essays will be required. These will be due on December 3rd and April 2nd. B.âSecond Year. Admission to this class presupposes preparation in character similar, if not equal, to that offered in Course A., which is intended to lead directly into this course. This class will meet three times a week, and graduation in this Course B. is necessary for those who elect English Literature as one of their studies for the B. A. degree. This course is as follows: 1. Rhetoric.âThis will comprise a rapid review of the principles of style and a careful study of invention in prose discourse. There will be occasional written exercises and particular attention will be given to the critical analysis of selected specimens. The course will be based on Genung's Rhetoric, but will not be limited to it. Text-Books.âBarrett Wendell's English Composition; Genung's Rhetoric; Genung's Hand-book of Rhetorical Analysis. 2. Versification.âThis course will be based upon the Professor's Notes on Poetics and will consider the mechanism of verse, the artistic elements in versification, history of verse-forms, kinds of poetry, etc. Class-exercises of various kinds will be arranged from time to time. Text-Book.âProfessor's Notes. References.âGummere's Hand-book of Poetics; Guest's English Rhythms; Schipper's Englische Metrik; Lanier's Science of English Verse, etc. 3. Literature.âAs members of this class are supposed to have some general acquaintance with the historical development of English Literature, this course will comprise some period of time, some literary form, some author or group of authors, or some general division of literary history. For '95-'96 there will be offered a course in American Literature. Text-Book.âRichardson's American Literature, supplemented by general and special references. Essays.âBesides the occasional written exercises of the class, four essays will be required of each student applying for graduation in this B. A. Course. These will be due October 17th, December 18th, March 18th, May 1st. The subjects will, in some cases, be assigned and at other times be left to the choice of the student, but will fall under these general heads: Description, Narration, Exposition, Argumentation or Persuasion. M. A. COURSE. In this course there will be occasional lectures, but in general the exercises of the class will be conducted by questions, conversation and conference. Readings will be assigned, independent investigation insisted upon, and written reports required from time to time. The students will be encouraged to form their own judgments and to express them orally or in writing. References for each author, period, or subject studied will be given, and the free use of the library in this and all courses is cordially recommended. COURSES HERETOFORE OFFERED. I. Representative Writers of English Prose. II. History of Lyric Poetry from 1550 to 1760. III. British Essayists from Bacon to Burke. IV. Victorian and American Poets. COURSES ANNOUNCED FOR '95-96. III. British Essayists from Bacon to Burke. This course will include Bacon, Cowley, Milton, Dryden, Swift, Defoe, Steele, Addison (Periodicals of the Eighteenth Century), Fielding, Bolingbroke, Warburton, Hume, Junius, Johnson, Goldsmith, and Burke. General and special references will be freely given. V. Tennyson, the Representative Poet of the Nineteenth Century. Dissertation.âAs an essential part of this course a dissertation showing independent and original work will be required. The theme of this dissertation may be selected by the student, with the Professor's approval; or, if desired, will be assigned by the Professor, but in either case the subject must be recorded by the Professor on or before January 15. PH. D. COURSE. This course will be, in some measure, adapted to the needs of the students desiring to pursue it. Its purposes will be to cultivate more fully the love of letters, to encourage independent and scholarly research, and to further the art of literary expression. It will include the study of some writer, or school of writers, or of some period or movement of literature, and will take into consideration the political, social, and literary characteristics of the time under discussion. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF HISTORICAL SCIENCE. Political Economy and Science of Society. Professor Holmes. In this class there are two courses, each of three lectures a week throughout the session. Political Economy will be prosecuted for the B. A., and Science of Society for the Ph. D. degree. Political Economy.âIn the treatment of this department of knowledge there is no rigid adherence to the school of Smith, Ricardo and Mill. The modification of older doctrines, necessitated by the increase of productive inventions and productive operations, is steadily regarded. Attention is paid to the inquiries and criticisms of Thornton, Cairnes, Jevons, Marshall, Nicholson, etc.; and to the altered views propounded by Laveleye, Walker, and the school of the Cathedrists and other German schools. Text-Books.âWalker's Political Economy (advanced course); Mill's Political Economy (abridged). [Subject to change.] Science of Society.âIn this (the Post-graduate course) is prosecuted the investigation of the laws and movements, the growth, decay, and constitution of Societies, in the different phases and stages of social development. The necessary organic functions of society are studied in their several forms. They are also regarded in their reciprocal relations and in their conjoint action in successive forms of civilization. All systems are interpreted; no ideal constitution is contemplated. The course is descriptive of processes by which experienced results have been obtained, not speculative in advocacy of theoretic dreams. This class is dependent on notes for the Lectures, as no text-book exists. History. Adjunct Professor Dabney. General History.âIn this class, which comprises the historical work required for the B. A. degree, great stress is laid on the view that the career of man, as revealed in History, is not a mere jumble of disconnected dates and facts, but a continuous stream, having its sources and tributaries in the far-off past, its outlet in the remote future. No attempt is made, however, to traverse in the class-room the entire length of this stream; for, although constant efforts are made to demonstrate the vital connection of nation with nation, of generation with generation, and of anterior with ensuing conditions of historical development, the lectures are confined to the more important periods, the student being required to fill the gaps by private reading, The periods, and, therefore, the text-books studied, may be more or less varied each year. Three lectures a week. Text-Books.âFisher's Outlines of Universal History; Abbott's Pericles and the Golden Age of Athens; Froude's CÃ¦sar; Capes's Age of the Antonines; Duruy's Middle Ages; Seebohm's Era of the Protestant Revolution; Gardiner's Thirty Years' War; Morris's Age of Anne; Dabney's Causes of the French Revolution; Morris's French Revolution and First Empire. English and American History.âIn this advanced class the principles taught in the preceding course will be applied to a more special field; and in order that the students may be encouraged to exercise independent thought and judgment, they will be required to write essays on assigned topics. Moreover, it should be distinctly understood that the text-books are by no means regarded by the professor as infallible authorities. On the contrary, some of them contain much that is emphatically rejected by him. And yet such books may be exceedingly useful; for to educate a man is not to stuff him full of cut-and-dried opinions, but rather to draw forth and develop his own judgment by presenting to his mind opinions that oppose and even clash violently with each other. With this end in view different text-books are studied side by side, the professor giving his own views of each and encouraging the students also to think for themselves. Graduates in General History will derive most benefit from this course. It may be taken, however, by others; and, as considerable attention will be paid to constitutional development, students intending to study Law will find the course of advantage. Candidates for the M. A. degree selecting History as one of their four subjects must graduate both in this course and in the preceding. Three lectures a week. Text-Books.âGardiner's History of England; Green's Short History of the English People; Gardiner's Atlas of English History; Percy Greg's History of the United States; Thwaites's Colonies; Hart's Formation of the Union; Wilson's Division and Re-union. The Post-Graduate Course.âThis course is designed for those students who aim at the Ph. D. degree and expect to become professors of History. A large amount of reading will be assigned, and frequent discussions of important points will be held between student and professor. The aim will be to cultivate the habit of original research; and, if History be the major subject of a candidate for the doctorate, a dissertation embodying the fruits of such research will be required. SCHOOL OF MORAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Davis. There are two classes arranged for two successive sessions. The First Class studies during the first half-session, Deductive and Inductive Logic; during the second half-session, Psychology. Three lectures a week. Text-Books.âThe Professor's Elements of Deductive Logic, Elements of Inductive Logic, Theory of Thought, and Elements of Psychology.

A. courses of these schools. The Astronomical Observatory is situated upon an elevation known as Mount Jefferson, which furnishes an unobstructed horizon. The principal building is a rotunda, forty-five feet in diameter, and contains the great Clark refractor of twenty-six inches aperture. The building and instrument are the gift of Leander J. McCormick, Esq., of Chicago. The computing rooms are adjoining, and contain clock, chronograph, etc., and a working library. In a smaller building are a three-inch Fauth transit and a four-inch Kahler equatorial. SCHOOL OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Professor Smith. This School offers four courses, each extending through the session of nine months, and including lectures, text-book study, and laboratory work, as follows: General Physics.âThe object of this course of lectures (which embraces the work for the B. A. degree) is to furnish the student with an introduction to Modern Physics. With the design of laying a scientific basis for the course, a large space is given at the outset to the discussion of the cardinal doctrines of motion, force, energy, and potential, and to their simpler applications in the pressure and motion of sensible masses. This discussion, while it is elementary, is designed to be in harmony with the more thorough mathematical treatment of the same topics and to be a helpful introduction to it. With this preparation, the student proceeds to the subject of Molecular Physics, prominence being given to those divisions, like Heat and Electricity, in which the transformations of energy are most easily followed and measured. Indeed, throughout the course the laws of energy are kept steadily in view, and an attempt is made to exhibit the evidence, daily becoming stronger and clearer, for the belief prevalent among scientists that the entire body of Physics is a coherent and harmonious system of mechanical truth. This course includes a series of exercises in the Physical Laboratory, selected with a view of training the student in the measurement of phenomena. Text-Books.âThe Professor's Syllabus, Everett's Units and Physical Constants. Sound and Light.âThis course (which embraces the work for the M. A. degree) treats of the theory of undulation and the transfer of Energy by waves. It includes careful work in the Physical Laboratory. Text-Books.âPreston's Theory of Light; Everett's Vibratory Motion and Sound; Glazebrook's Practical Physics. Electricity and Magnetism.âThis class studies Electricity and Magnetism, with special reference to Electrical Engineering, to which the course is designed to be an introduction. Besides the mathematical theory, it embraces Laboratory practice in electrical and magnetic measurements. To enter this class, the student should be familiar with the elementary facts of the science, and also with the simpler processes of differentiation and integration. Text-Books.âEmtage; Ewing; Jackson. Advanced Physics.âThis course includes the study of original memoirs in special departments of Physics, and of the history of Experimental Science, together with laboratory work showing independent research. The report of this work may be the dissertation offered for the attainment of the Ph. D. degree. The Physical Laboratory has at its disposal five connected apartments, all on the same floor. One of these is also used as a lecture-room; another one is permanently darkened, and in two others the light may be excluded at pleasure. A fourth room is so supported on massive piers as to be practically free from sensible tremors. The needful appliances, in the way of fixtures and apparatus, have been so far supplied as to furnish a sufficient range of practice for undergraduates, and some facilities for the advanced student in Practical Physics. SCHOOL OF CHEMISTRY. Professor Mallet. In this School the following courses are offered: General Chemistry.âThis course consists of three lectures a week throughout the session. The fundamental ideas of chemical science, the relations of Chemistry to Physics, the laws expressing the facts of chemical combination by weight and by volume, the atomic theory as at present developed in connection with Chemistry, the chemical nomenclature and symbols now in use, and a general survey of the Descriptive Chemistry of the elements and their compounds, inorganic and organic, are brought forward in order, with incidental allusion to the applications in the arts and manufactures, and in medicine, of the facts mentioned. Text-Books.âFownes's Chemistry (last edition); Syllabus of the Professor's Lectures. Recommended for Reference.âRoscoe and Schorlemmer's (or Miller's) Elements of Chemistry; Lothar Meyer's Outlines of Theoretical Chemistry (English trans.); Bernthsen's Text-book of Organic Chemistry, translated by McGowan; Watt's Dictionary of Chemistry. Industrial Chemistry.âThis course, in which also three lectures a week are delivered, examines in detail the chemical principles and processes specially concerned in the more important arts and manufactures, upon which the development of the natural resources of the country in large measure depends, the opportunity being thus presented of preparation for such positions as those of the miner and metallurgist, the chemical manufacturer, the dyer, bleacher, tanner, sugar-refiner, etc. Text-Book.âWagner's Chemical Technology.

The collections of the University in illustration of the processes and products of Industrial Chemistry have been procured at much expense and pains in this country, England, France and Germany, and are unusually extensive and good; amongst the best on this side of the Atlantic. In both courses there are one or more reviews each week of the subjects under discussion, involving questions put by, as well as to, the students; and exercises in writing are from time to time given out to afford practice in the calculations which are needed by the chemist. Post-Graduate work is offered in either course, and either or both may be taken by the candidate for the Ph. D. degree. Laboratory work will be required on subjects involving original investigation. Advanced reading may also be prescribed, especially in the shape of the literature of particular topics, to be looked up from various sources and condensed by the student. Graduation in General Chemistry is required for the B. A. degree, graduation in both General and Industrial Chemistry for the M. A. For admission to a post-graduate course in the School of Chemistry or in the School of Analytical Chemistry, previous graduation in both the schools named will be required; but this part of the requirement may be waived, provided satisfactory evidence be furnished that the student has already made equivalent attainments elsewhere. SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY. Professor Dunnington. The regular work of this School, constituting a complete course in Practical Chemistry, is arranged in two divisions, as follows: 1. A regularly arranged course in Chemical Manipulation is first given. This is followed by Blow-pipe Analysis and Fire Assays of ores of lead, silver, and gold. A systematic course in Inorganic Qualitative Analysis follows, with practice in the analysis of mixtures of salts, alloys, ores, and so on. Stoichiometry is taught by exercises and occasional lectures. Instruction in the elements of the Quantitative Analysis completes this division of the course, which extends over the first half-session. 2. The work of the second division is an extended course of Quantitative Analysis, both gravimetric and volumetric. The student determines the composition of ores, minerals, clays, soils, manures, technical products, and so on. As he advances in the course he is encouraged to undertake original research and assisted in its prosecution; and, in determining his fitness for graduation, work of this kind is considered as having great weight. Five lessons are given each week, and the Laboratory is open to students six days in the week during all the working hours of the day. Students may matriculate either for the Full Course or for the First Course, but candidates for graduation are required to complete the Full Course. Those who accomplish it are prepared for work as Analytical Chemists, Assayers, or Teachers of Chemistry. Among the works recommended to laboratory students are: Fresenius's Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis; Venable's Qualitative Analysis (2d ed.); Greville Williams's Hand-book of Chemical Manipulation; Woehler's Examples for Practice in Chemical Analysis; Foye's Hand-book of Mineralogy; A. Classen's Elementary Quantitative Analysis. In addition to the foregoing, the following Special Courses are given in this School. They are open without additional charge to the regular students of the School. For fees to others, see Expenses. 1. A laboratory course on Determinative Mineralogy for students of Engineering, embracing Blow-pipe Analysis, Determinative Mineralogy, and the application of chemical processes to the examination of potable waters, coal, clays, building stones, and other materials employed in Engineering. 2. A laboratory course in Assaying, including all of the above mentioned course on Determinative Mineralogy, together with Fire Assaying of ores of lead, silver, gold, etc., and practice in volumetric and galvanic determinations, such as are commonly employed in the valuation of certain technical products and ores. 3. A laboratory course of twelve lessons in Practical Pharmacy, including the compounding and dispensing of drugs. The pursuit of this course will enable the practitioner satisfactorily to dispense medicines, and it will afford him needed familiarity with handling chemicals and the forms of prescriptions. 4. A course of twenty-four lectures on Agricultural Chemistry, including a discussion of the chemical and physical properties of the atmosphere, of soils and of plants; the chemistry of the processes of vegetable life as far as they are related to Agriculture; the chemical composition and preparation of manures; the chemistry of stock feeding, and so on. This course is open without charge to students from Virginia and to farmers who are not matriculated students. For Reference.âJohnson's and Cameron's Elements of Agricultural Chemistry and Geology (17th ed.); Johnson's How Crops Grow; Johnson's How Crops Feed; Armsby's Manual of Cattle Feeding. The Post-Graduate Course comprises practice in the more elaborate processes of analysis, study of methods, and original investigations in the composition of rare materials and technical products presenting scientific or economic interest. The Chemical Laboratory is a building planned and erected for the purpose. It is warmed throughout by hot water, completely fitted with the most approved appliances, and stocked with apparatus, models, materials, and specimens. The commodious lecture-room, with work and store-rooms attached, is provided with every convenience for exhibiting a complete series of experiments illustrating the lectures on General Chemistry. The large room assigned to Analytical Chemistry will accommodate fifty working students, and is furnished with work-tables, gas, water, and all proper laboratory fixtures; smaller rooms are devoted to weighing, evaporations, assaying, etc., and all requisite apparatus, chemicals, minerals, materials for analysis, etc., are kept constantly supplied by home purchase and importation. The Museum of Industrial Chemistry, contained in the same building, consists of a very large number of specimens, collected at much expense and pains in this country and abroad, to illustrate the products and processes of Chemistry applied to the arts and manufactures, and is so arranged as to be a most valuable aid to the student of Industrial Chemistry. CORCORAN SCHOOL OF NATURAL HISTORY AND GEOLOGY. Professor Fontaine. In this School two subjects are taught, Geology and Descriptive Mineralogy. There are two coursesâfirst, a course embracing the requisites in Geology for the attainment of the degree of Bachelor of Arts; and second, a course covering what is required in Mineralogy and Geology for the degree of Master of Arts. B. A. COURSE. Three lectures a week will be given throughout the session. The design of the course is to enable the student to obtain such a knowledge of the science of Geology as should be possessed by a well-educated man. As full an exposition of the fundamental principles will be given as the time will allow. Text-Books.âLe Conte's Elements of Geology and Dana's New Text-Book of Geology. The instruction will be in part by lecture. M. A. COURSE. This course consists of two divisions, one in Mineralogy, the other in Geology. Mineralogy.âThe course in Mineralogy closes with the examination which takes place in January. Three lectures a week are given in it. In this course attention is paid to crystallography, and especially to the physical properties of minerals. In Descriptive Mineralogy the relations, geological occurrence, and history of the individual species are made prominent. Geology.âThis division of the course begins after the examination on Mineralogy in January. Three lectures a week will be given. A knowledge of the principles taught in the B. A. course will be assumed. The more general and complicated problems in all the branches of Geology will be dealt with in this course. As thorough a treatment as possible will be given of Stratigraphy, Lithology, and Paleontology. More stress will be laid on the methods of field-work and the application of geological principles. The aim will be to give such a knowledge of the subject as may be useful to the student in bread-winning pursuits, or may serve as a basis for the more specialized course required for the attainment of the degree of Ph. D. Text-Books.âLe Conte's Elements of Geology; Dana's Manual of Geology (new edition). For Reference.âGeikie's Text-Book of Geology. The instruction will be in part by lecture. PH. D. COURSE. The Post-Graduate Course in this School is so arranged as to enable the student to concentrate his efforts in some special line of study. Selections will be made from one or both of the subjects taught in the School. The work will be adapted to the wants of the student, and, as far as possible, original research will be required in the treatment of the branches chosen. Candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Arts are required to pass in the B. A. Course, and those for the degree of Master of Arts in the M. A. Course in Geology and in Mineralogy, in addition to the B. A. Course. For the degree of Doctor of Philosophy the candidate must, in addition to the requisites for the degree of Master of Arts, complete the Post-Graduate Course. The Lewis Brooks Museum contains collections illustrating the main sub-divisions of Natural History. Each of the collections is arranged so as to exemplify the principles of the science, and at the same time offers a large variety of subjects for advanced study. In Geology the specimens show all the different kinds of rocks, classified according to mineral character and the formations in which they occur; the collection of fossils, plaster casts, maps, etc., is exceptionally fine, and fully illustrates Historical Geology. In Mineralogy the principles of the science are made plain by well-chosen suits of specimens, models of crystals, etc.; the general collection of minerals contains all the important minerals, and many of the rarer ones, in good specimens. Zoology is well illustrated by a fine and large collection of mounted skeletons, stuffed animals, dried specimens, plaster casts, etc. In Botany the collections contain charts, papier-machÃ© models of flowers and fruits, sections of wood, etc.; the bulk of the collection is in the form of an herbarium, selected from the most important and interesting botanical regions of the world. In addition to the above, a beginning has been made of a collection to illustrate the geology and mineralogy of the State of Virginia, and this will be increased as rapidly as possible. These large and carefully selected collections of geological and mineralogical objects afford unsurpassed facilities for the full illustration of the principles taught. As free access to these collections is allowed the student, he can find in their study an opportunity, rarely obtained, for gaining a practical acquaintance with natural objects acquired from various parts of the world, and chosen for their typical character. These collections are especially useful to students pursuing Post-Graduate courses of study in Geology and Mineralogy. The Professor, when the number of applicants is sufficient, organizes a party of geological exploration. The field-work is done in the month of July, and is entirely optional with the students. Persons engaged in the study of Geology and Mineralogy may, although not members of the University class, with the consent of the Professor, and on paying $25 to the Proctor, join the exploring party. MILLER SCHOOL OF BIOLOGY AND AGRICULTURE. Professor Tuttle. The work of this School is designed to meet the wants of students who desire such knowledge of the principles of Biology and of the methods of biological research as should properly form part of a liberal education, or who desire such training as will fit them for independent work as students or as teachers in that department of knowledge; and of those who seek such acquaintance with the facts and laws of Biology as will prepare them for an intelligent study of the relations of Biology to Agriculture. The following courses are offered, each with three lectures a week throughout the session; the associated study for each on the part of the student is performed chiefly in the laboratory, which is excellently equipped for the purpose. I. Botany.âThe study of Biology is begun by a brief survey of the principal groups of the Vegetable Kingdom, beginning with the lowest and simplest forms. As the more complex forms are reached, their histology is discussed in its physiological as well as its morphological relations. Special attention is paid, as far as time will permit, to those groups of plants which have special economic importance, and to the flora of the region. On account of their great practical importance in many respects, including their relations to health and disease in man and the domestic animals, the Bacteria are discussed and studied at length. Attendance on this portion of the course is required of students in the Medical Department of the University. Text-Books.âPrantl and Vines's Text-Book of Botany; Stokes's Key to Freshwater Algae; Gray's Manual. II. Comparative Anatomy and Physiology.âThis course is devoted to the study of the Anatomy, Histology and Embryology of Vertebrates, and to the principles of Animal Physiology. The general structure and functions of the vertebrate body, as illustrated by a series of representative forms, will be considered; and one or more systems of organs discussed and examined comparatively, both in the adult and the developing organism. The normal histology of man and the domestic animals will be studied in detail. Attendance upon the portion of the course devoted to Histology is required of medical students, who are also admitted to the lectures on Embryology at their option. Text-Books.âWiedersheim's Comparative Anatomy of the Vertebrates; Parker's Zootomy; Shaefer's Histology; Foster and Balfour's Embryology. Graduation in either of these courses may be offered as one of the electives for the degree of Bachelor of Arts. III. Vegetable Morphology.âAn advanced course in Botany, devoted chiefly to the study of the Algae and Fungi, and to the Histology of the Vascular Plants. The completion of Course I., or its equivalent either here or elsewhere, is required as a preliminary to this course. Text-Books.âBennett and Murray's Cryptogamic Botany; Strasburger's Practical Botany (Hillhouse tr.). The library of the department contains numerous standard works of reference. IV. Vertebrate Morphology.âAn advanced course based on Course II., the completion of which, or its equivalent, is required as preliminary. The work will consist of more detailed comparative study of vertebrate structure and development, and of the forms which may be regarded as phylogenetically related to the Vertebrate stock. Text-Books will be indicated as needed. The library of the department contains a good amount of standard and periodical literature bearing on the subject of this course. Courses III. and IV. will not both be given the same year, that one being chosen which is elected by the greater number of eligible students, at the beginning of the session. Graduation in Courses I. and II. and either III. or IV. will be required of candidates for a diploma of graduation in the School of Biology, and of those offering Biology as one of their electives for the degree of Master of Arts. V. Zoology.âThis course, open to graduate students only, includes the study of Animal Morphology, as illustrated by the Anatomy, Histology and, as far as possible, the Embryology of a series of representative species chosen from the principal divisions of the Animal Kingdom, the principles of classification, and the arrangement of the various orders and classes of animals in larger groups as indicated by their structural affinities. Text-Books.âRolleston's Forms of Animal Life; Claus's Text-Book of Zoology; Lang's Text-Book of Comparative Anatomy; Balfour's Embryology. This course will be required of all students who elect Biology as one of their studies for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy; those who choose it as a major study will be required, in addition, to do such work as may be assigned to them individually. VI. Practical Biology and Agriculture.âThe relations of Biology to Agriculture are so manifold, and the subdivisions of the latter subject so numerous, that it would be impossible to exhaust the discussion of either in the work of any one year. A course consisting in part of lectures and in part of an equivalent amount of practical work and collateral reading will be offered yearly. It will include the discussion of selected topics pertaining to Economic Botany (such as the diseases or the parasites of plants, the natural history of cultivated varieties, and the like); to Economic Zoology (such as the life-history and treatment of injurious or beneficial insects, external or internal parasites, the special anatomy and physiology of the domestic animals, etc.); and to questions connected with the Principles of Agriculture (such as the laws of growth and nutrition of crops, the drainage and tillage of soils, systems of rotation and allied topics). Text-Books for 1895-'96.âWard's Timber and its Diseases; Hough's Elements of Forestry; Chauveau's Anatomy of the Domestic Animals. Candidates for a diploma of graduation in Biology and Agriculture are required to complete Courses I., II. and VI. The Biological Laboratory is well provided with instruments for the gross and minute dissection of animals and plants; microscopes, microtomes, reagents, and materials for the staining and mounting of preparations; apparatus for photography and microphotography, and other necessary appliances, not only for student work, but for investigation and research as well. In addition to the large and valuable collections of the Brooks Museum, an abundant supply of other necessary specimens and material is furnished. A library of reference is attached to the Laboratory, and students have access to a number of leading biological and agricultural journals, thus acquiring practice in the intelligent use of current literature.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Academical Degrees. In each Academical School a diploma of graduation is conferred in the B. A. Course. Students who complete both the B. A. and the M. A. Course in any School are entitled to a diploma of graduation in the School. The titled degrees conferred in the Academical Department are Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts, and Doctor of Philosophy. The degree of Bachelor of Arts of the University of Virginia is designed to secure in the candidate such a thorough and well-proportioned general training in all of the great departments of human knowledgeâAncient Languages, Modern Languages, History and Literature, Philosophy, Mathematical Science, Natural Science, and Natural Historyâas will fit him to fill his part in the vocations of life, whether in the field of business, in the pursuit of the learned professions, or in the special studies preparatory to didactic or scientific work. This degree is accordingly conferred upon a student who has been graduated in eight B. A. Courses, selected from the following list, of which, however, at least one must be taken from each group: A.âAncient Languages. LatinâGreek. B.âModern Languages. FrenchâGermanâSpanishâItalian. C.âHistory and Literature. General HistoryâEnglish LiteratureâModern English. D.âPhilosophical Science. Political EconomyâLogic and Psychology. E.âMathematical Sciences. MathematicsâAstronomyâMechanics. F.âNatural Science. General ChemistryâPhysicsâGeologyâBiology. The degree of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia is designed for students who desire to extend their work in certain departments of learning so as to lay a broader foundation for professional study, to equip themselves for the work of teaching, or to prepare for specialized lines of research in letters or science. It is conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts who has been graduated in each of four Schools, elected by himself and approved by the Faculty. The utmost freedom of election will be encouraged in the arrangement of these courses, subject to the condition that the four lines of advanced work chosen shall be so related as to form a rationally connected whole. It is expressly ordered, however, that none of the work done for the B. A. degree shall be counted again as part of the advanced work required for the M. A. degree, nor shall the advanced work done for the M. A. degree be counted also for the B. A. degree. The preliminary degree required of candidates for the M. A. degree may be that of this University or of some other chartered institution of learning. But in the latter case the degree shall be submitted for approval to the Faculty, who have absolute power to accept or reject the degree offered. The candidate must in all cases be graduated in the B. A. Course in each School before he is admitted to the M. A. Course in that School. But this last condition may be waived by the Faculty in favor of a candidate who evidences upon examination adequate preliminary training to pursue with profit the M. A. Course simultaneously with the B. A. Course of the School. A Bachelor of Arts of any other chartered institution of learning who enters this University as a candidate for the M. A. degree, must submit to the Faculty a statement showing the four major studies in which he proposes to pursue the M. A. Courses, and four associated minor studies, which would complete the requirements for the B. A. and M. A. degrees. Under the regulations of the Visitors, he will be required to pursue here both the B. A. and the M. A. Courses in the four major studies. But in any or all of the four minor studies he will be excused from attendance upon the regular B. A. Courses upon presenting his diploma and passing a SPECIAL EXAMINATION at this University in such studies. This examination will, in all cases, be of a practical character, designed to test the permanent acquisition by the student of a sound general knowledge of the several subjects. Bachelors of Arts who are deficient in any of the minor studies may fill out their schemes of study by attending the regular B. A. Courses at this University in those subjects and passing the regular examinations. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy of the University of Virginia is offered to students who propose to devote their energies to specialized research in any of the various departments of letters or science. It will be conferred on a Bachelor of Arts or Master of Arts who has passed examination in the Post-graduate Courses of two Schools, elected by himself and approved by the Faculty, and in addition has prepared and printed a dissertation, accepted by the Professors of the Schools elected, as showing independent research or original treatment of some subject belonging to the School chosen as his major study. The preliminary degree required of candidates for the Ph. D. degree may be that of this University or of some other chartered institution of learning. But in the latter case the degree must be approved by the Faculty, and the candidate must in all cases be graduated in each of the two Schools elected before he is admitted to the Ph. D. Course in that School. The last condition may be waived by the Faculty in favor of a candidate who evidences upon examination adequate preliminary training to pursue with profit the Ph. D. Course at the same time with the M. A. Course of the School.</field>

In this Department three distinct courses of study are offered, in Civil Engineering, Mining Engineering, and Mechanical and Electrical Engineering. Each course is designed to occupy for a well-prepared student a period of three years, and leads to the appropriate professional degree. In addition to the general scientific courses described in the earlier pages of these Announcements, the following special professional courses are offered. In each three lectures a week are given, extending through the entire session: 1. Descriptive Geometry.âThe first half-session is devoted to the Descriptive Geometry of the point, the straight line, and the plane. Great stress is laid at the outset on the cultivation of the power of forming clear mental pictures of space-relations, and this capacity is disciplined and improved by the copious use of constructive exercises, solved by the student at the blackboard or the drawing-table. The second half-session is devoted to the study of the projections, intersections, tangencies and developments of ruled surfaces and revolutes, with their applications to the theory of shades and shadows, of axonometric, and of perspective projections. Through the entire course the drawing-table is in constant use. (Mr. Echols.) Text-Books.âLow's Practical Solid Geometry; Waldo's Exercises in Descriptive Geometry; Lectures on Shades and Shadows, Axonometric, and Perspective Projections. 2. Engineering Geodesy.âIn the first half-session the field-instruments of the engineer are studied theoretically and practically. Linear measuring apparatus, the transit, the level, the plane-table, the solar transit, the sextant, and the barometer, are examined in detail. Thorough familiarity with all their parts, adjustments and uses is insisted on. The fundamental problems of surveying and location are then mastered, and with this preparation a complete study of land, city, mining, and topographical surveying completes the first disvision of the course. The second half-session is given to a minute study of the reconnoissance, preliminary survey, location, and construction of lines of communication. The chief part of the work is in Railway Engineering. The study of Highway and Canal construction and maintenance completes the course. (Mr. Echols.) Text-Books.âJohnson's Surveying; Baker's Instruments; Byrne's Highway Construction; Vernon-Harcourt's Rivers and Canals; Lectures on Railroad Construction. 3. Mining.âThe exploitation of mines is minutely studied from the preliminary geological survey through the prospect, location and survey to the extraction of the ore. The construction of works of exploration, blocking out the ore, and extraction by shaft or incline or adit are discussed in detail. The methods of drainage, ventilation, lighting and underground transport are investigated. The subject of the mechanical treatment of the ore is next considered, and the various processes of ore-breaking and wet and dry concentration are discussed. The course closes with the study of Hydraulic Placer mining. (Mr. Echols.) Text-Books.âCallon's Lectures on Mining; Bowie's Hydraulic Mining. 4. Bridge Construction.âThe sources and properties of the materials used in bridge construction are first discussed. The principles of bridge location are next considered, and the various methods of construction for bridge foundations are studied. The statical analysis and design of arched bridges in masonry are next investigated. The straining actions in framed bridge structures are then examined, and examples of standard types of steel and iron girder bridges are critically analyzed, complete designs being worked out for certain of the more important forms. The preparation of the plans, specifications, working drawings, and bills of materials are thoroughly discussed. The course closes with a careful analysis of the more complex types of bridge designâthe continuous girder, the braced arch, and the suspension bridgeâand a critical review of some great illustrative modern structures. (Mr. Thornton.) Text-Books. Thurston's Materials of Construction; Baker's Masonry Construction; Johnson's Modern Frame Structures. 5. Steam Engineering.âThe general principles of Machine Design are first given and applied to the study of the elements of machines and the ordinary methods of the transmission of power. The course proceeds next to a systematic exposition of the properties and modes of generation of steam, and of the design of steam boilers and the management of steam plants. The steam engine is then considered, and the rules deduced for its proportions, and the construction of valve-gears, governors, and fly-wheels carefully analyzed. Finally, a careful study of the thermodynamics of the steam engine is given, and the methods for testing the performance of engines and boilers are fully investigated. Text-Books.âReuleaux, The Constructor; Ewing's Steam and the Steam Engine; Munro's Steam Boilers; Peabody's Valve-Gears; Peabody's Steam Tables. 6. Hydraulic Engineering.âThe course begins with a systematic study of the principles of Hydrostatics and Hydraulics and their applications in the design of dams for reservoirs and of conduits for the transmission of water. The fundamental problems of canal and river engineering are then approached, and the methods used for the control and improvement of water-supplies for power, irrigation and navigation are examined. The subject of hydraulic machinery follows, and a careful analysis of the action of water-wheels, turbines, water-pressure engines and pumps is made, and rules for their design are deduced. The problems of sanitary engineering are next examined under the several divisions of city water-supplies, surface and subsoil drainage, sewerage of cities, and sewage disposal. The course concludes with a study of theoretical thermodynamics and the applications to the problems of heating and ventilation, and to the design of air compressors, gas-engines, and so on. (Mr. Thornton.) Text-Books.âMerriman's Hydraulics; Bodmer's Turbines; Turner and Brightmore's Water-Works Engineering; Baumeister's Sewerage of Cities; Lectures on Thermodynamics; Clerk's Gas Engines. In addition to the foregoing lecture courses, the following practical courses are given: Field-Work with the chain and tape, level, compass, transit, plane-table, barometer, and current meter is required of all students of Civil and Mining Engineering, the work extending over three years. A thorough drill is given in the use and adjustments of the instruments. Mechanical Drawing is required of all students in the School, and extends over three years. It embraces a careful drill in the use of drawing instruments, with constant practice in the drawing-room in the preparation of the various plates, maps, and designs required in connection with the above courses. Shop-work in wood and iron is required of all students of Mechanical Engineering, and extends over two years. It includes a series of graduated exercises with hand and machine tools in wood and metal, and instruction in forging. Associated with the various lecture courses also are a series of laboratory exercises. Tests are made by all the students of the strength and elasticity of constructive materials. Students of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering are required also to make tests of the pressure, temperature, and humidity of the steam used in the engine, and to calibrate the gauges, thermometers, and calorimeters employed for this purpose; to determine the evaporative power and efficiency of the boiler, and to measure the indicated power and the brake power of the engine. The Mechanical Laboratory contains a twenty-five horse-power Ball automatic high-speed engine; an upright tubular boiler; a forty-five light Edison dynamo; a collection of hand and machine tools, gauges, thermometers, barometers, dynamometers, calorimeters, and other apparatus for engine and boiler trials; a 100,000-pound Olsen testing machine for tensile, transverse and compressive tests of the strength and elasticity of materials; a 1,000-pound cement-tester; and the necessary appliances for micrometric measurements of strain. Apparatus for torsional tests of strength and rigidity and for the precise measurements of tensile strains have been added. The collection of Field Instruments contains a surveyor's compass, a railroad compass, a wye level, a dumpy level, a plain transit, a complete transit, with the Saegmuller Solar attachment, a plane-table, a sextant, a standard barometer, an aneroid barometer, and a full supply of ranging-poles, flag-poles, chains, tapes, and other accessories, with a planimeter, a trigonometer, and two vernier-protractors for use in office-work.

JOHNSON BARBOUR,* * Died December 2d, 1894. GEORGE W. PALMER, CHARLES E. VAWTER. R. T. W. DUKE, Treasurer. R. T. W. DUKE, Jr., Secretary. The Agricultural Department is founded on the gift of one hundred thousand dollars by the late Samuel Miller, of Lynchburg, Va. It comprises the Schools named above. Students of Agriculture may either elect a special course of study entirely from these Schools, or may combine with them certain of the Literary Schools, with the view of becoming candidates for the degrees of B. A., M. A., or Ph. D. For example, such a student might offer for his B. A. degree Latin, French, English Literature, and Political Economy, with Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and Mechanics, and might then proceed to his Ph. D. degree in the Schools of Biology and Agriculture, and Analytical Chemistry. The Miller Scholarship is awarded at the end of each session to the student who then passes the graduating examinations in the B. A. courses of Biology I., Chemistry and Physics with the highest aggregate of marks. The scholarship is tenable for two years. The emoluments consist of $250 a session, with free tuition in the Schools of the Agricultural Department. The Miller scholar is required to elect at least one-third of his work in Biology and Agriculture, Analytical Chemistry, or Applied Mathematics. The tenure of the scholarship depends upon the good conduct and studious diligence of the scholar, the Faculty being authorized to withdraw its benefits from any student who does not avail himself of the opportunities for study which it is intended to secure.

      <field name="fulltext">Expenses. In the Academical Department the necessary expenses of a student for the session of nine months are estimated as below for the lowest rate and for a more liberal scale of living, assuming in each case that the student attends three Schools. Tuition, $ 75 $ 75 Matriculation, 30 30 Infirmary, 7 7 Contingent deposit, 10 10 Dormitory rent, 15 30 Servant's attendance, 9 9 Furniture for dormitory, 9 19 Fuel and lights, 12 24 Washing, 14 14 Board, 99 162 Total, 280 380 Payable on entrance, 200 256 Reduced charges to Virginians, 205 305 Payable on entrance, 125 180 The contingent deposit of $10 is credited in final settlement. This deposit is assessed for any damage to property, violation of Library rules, and so on, which the student himself may commit. To the above total must be added the cost of books and stationery and laboratory materials, and the cost of the degree, if taken. In the Engineering Department the tuition fee is usually $100 (instead of $75), with a reduction of $50 only to Virginians, other charges remaining the same. In the Agricultural Department the tuition fee is usually $100, which is remitted to Virginians, other charges remaining the same. In all cases a moderate allowance of pocket-money for contingent expenses must be made. For this purpose $5 a month should usually suffice; more than $10 a month is ordinarily excessive. Students from Virginia.âIn compliance with the statute (Virginia Code, 1887, ch. 68, Â§ 1554), the University offers to white male students from Virginia over the age of sixteen years instruction without charge for tuition in all the Academical Schools, except the Laboratory courses in Chemistry and Practical Physics. The total University fees of an Academical student from Virginia are only $47; his necessary expenses amount to but $205, exclusive of laboratory materials, books and stationery; of this about $105 must be paid on entrance. The Faculty are required by law to be satisfied by actual examination of the applicant, or by a certificate from some college or preparatory school, that he has made such proficiency in each branch of study which he proposes to pursue as will enable him to avail himself of the advantages offered by the University. Examinations for admission are required as follows: 1. For admission to the School of Latin, on forms, syntax, and Books i., ii. of CÃ¦sar's Commentaries, with Cicero's Orations against Catiline. 2. For admission to the School of Greek, on forms, syntax, and Books i., ii. of Xenophon's Anabasis. 3. For admission to the School of Mathematics or Natural Philosophy, on Arithmetic, Plane Geometry, and Algebra through quadratics. For admission to the other Schools, a good knowledge of English and Arithmetic is alone required. The diploma of a college, or the certificate of a high school, has appropriate weight with the examiners. White male teachers and superintendents of the Public Schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Schools of the Academical Department of the University without payment of fees, upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the Public Schools. Applicants for admission are requested to send in their names to the Chairman of the Faculty not later than March 5th. Lodgings can be had near the University. The only necessary expenses will be for board, lights, and washing, which will together cost from $4 to $6 a week. Local Examinations.âWritten examinations, beginning May 1st, 1896, and extending over three days, will be held at different centres by examiners appointed by the University of Virginia. Every candidate admitted to examination will be required to pay a fee of two dollars ($2.00) to defray the necessary expenses. The examinations are open to boys and girls alike; but where girls are examined there will be a separate room for their use, and a local committee of ladies will be invited to preside. The examinations are of two gradesâJunior and Seniorâand are offered in sections, as follows: EnglishâHistory and GeographyâLatinâFrenchâ GermanâMathematicsâMechanicsâChemistryâGeologyâBotany.

LYMAN SKEEN, Jr., Assistant Demonstrator of Medical Biology. General Course of Studies in the Medical Department.âThe session of the Medical Department continues through the full nine months of the University session. The studies included in the Medical course are as follows: Chemistry, Anatomy, Histology, Bacteriology, Physiology, Materia Medica, Hygiene, Pathology, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Practice of Medicine, and Medical Jurisprudence. These studies are arranged for a two years' course, and are pursued in the following order: During the first session (of nine months): Anatomy, Histology, Chemistry, Physiology and Bacteriology. During the second session (of nine months): Materia Medica, Practice of Medicine, Hygiene, Pathology, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Medical Jurisprudence. Relations of the Student in the Second Year.âStudents who pass a satisfactory examination on the subjects studied during the first session are not required to attend the lectures or stand the written examinations on these subjects the second year; but if a student fails to pass a satisfactory examination at the regular time on one or more of the subjects included in the first year's course, he will be permitted to take such subject or subjects over during the second year, without the payment of any additional fee, and if he passes a satisfactory examination on these subjects, as well as those of the second session, he will be permitted to graduate at the close of that session. Requisites for Graduation.âNo student is permitted to graduate from the University of Virginia with the degree of Doctor of Medicine till he shall have attended the regular course of not less than two years in this institution, and passed a satisfactory examination on all the subjects included in the Medical course, unless he shall have attended one course of lectures of seven months, or two courses of less than seven months each, in some other reputable medical school, in which case he may apply for graduation at the end of his first session in this institution; but in order to obtain the degree he must pass a satisfactory examination at this University on all the subjects heretofore mentioned as included in the Medical course. Certificates of Attendance.âNo student will receive a certificate as a member of the Medical Department of the University unless he has attended the whole regular course of the first or the second year. Methods of Instruction.âThe instruction is given by systematic lectures and daily oral examinations, with associated practical work in Anatomy, Histology, Bacteriology, and Pathology. The daily oral examinations on the subject of the previous lectures are of great value in stimulating the student to regular and systematic habits of study, and furnishing the Professor an opportunity of discovering and removing difficulties met with by the student. The Graduating Examinations are in writing and of a rigorous character. Two sets of these are held each yearâone near the close of the session, after completion of the lecture courses; the other at the beginning of the next session. To the latter are admittedâ (a) Students of the previous session who from illness or other cause approved by the Faculty were unable to present themselves for examination. These may be examined on any part of the course, and shall not be required to matriculate anew. (b) Students who passed examinations in two of the primary studies (Chemistry, Biology, Anatomy, Physiology) at the close of the previous session, and attained on the other two such a standard (but little lower than graduation) as the Faculty may approve. (c) Students who present certificates of attendance on one seven months' course or its equivalent at some other reputable medical school. Students falling under classes (b) and (c), after matriculating and passing the Fall examinations on the primary studies, may proceed to graduation in the work of the second year, without attending lectures or passing further examination in the primary studies except the general oral examination. No special examination will be given in the Medical Department except under extraordinary circumstances. A General Oral Examinatlon is held each year prior to graduation (at the close of the session) on all the different branches on which the student has passed during either that session or some preceding one. This is intended to test the permanent acquisition of such general knowledge as every practitioner of medicine should possess. Clinical Instruction.âThe Piedmont Hospital, in the adjoining city of Charlottesville, is utilized as far as its capacity will permit, and during the past year the second-course students have had the opportunity of seeing a number of operations there. The University Dispensary is in successful operation, and during the past year twenty-three hundred new patients have been treated. Clinics are held four times a week, to which second-course students only are admitted. In recognition of the impossibility of giving practical instuction by the ordinary clinical lectures, the class is divided into sections, so that each student may have the opportunity of examining patients for himself under the guidance of the teacher. Messrs. Jesse Ramsburg, C. B. Williams, J. A. Williams, R. S. Blakeman and J. W. Booth have acted as student-assistants at the Dispensary during 1894-'95. ANATOMY. Professor Christian. Descriptive Anatomy.âThe instruction is given by didactic lectures, combined with the course of Practical Anatomy as taught in the Dissecting Hall. The endeavor throughout is to render the teaching as completely practical as possible; no statement is made that is not illustrated by its exhibition, either on the actual dissection or on the preparation of a dissection, the effort being to convey knowledge in the so-called natural methodâthat is, by mental imagery formed by repeated observations of nature. This is accomplished by exhibiting to the student and requiring him to handle the dissected parts and preparations made therefrom. The equipment of the School for his purpose is most ample. Practical Anatomy.âFor this course dissecting material, obtained under the permissive law of the State, is abundantly supplied without cost to the student. Attendance in the dissecting-room is compulsory, a strict record being kept in the case of each student. Besides the ordinary oral and written examinations, each student is required to stand eight practical examinationsâone upon osteology, four upon different parts of the muscular system, one on the viscera, one on the ligaments, and one on the vessels and nerves. These examinations are oral and private, each student being questioned alone. They consist in the identification of the truths of anatomy on the bones, and the dissected cadaver, and are thus a perfect test of the student's acquaintance with the gross structure of the human body. Regional Anatomy.âThis subject is taught to second-course students by the same practical methods as are described above. HISTOLOGY. Professor Tuttle. Normal Histology is taught by lectures, accompanied by practical work in the laboratory, which is amply equipped for the purpose. The class is divided into working sections of thirty-six, that number of desks being provided with microscopes, accessory apparatus, and all necessary reagents. The primary object of the course is to make the student practically familiar with the normal appearance and characteristics of the structural elements of the body, their groupings into tissues, and the disposition and relations of the latter as making up the various organs of the body. As a means to this end, students are carefully trained in the use of the microscope, and, as much as practicable, in histological technique. The accuracy and readiness of the knowledge acquired is tested for each student by individual practical examination, in which he is required to name and describe at sight preparations of tissues and sections of organs submitted to him; the usual written examination must also be passed. Text-Books Recommended.âKlein's, Piersol's, or Shaefer's Histology; the Professor's Syllabus. Embryology.âOptional attendance (without additional charge) upon the course in Comparative Embryology is granted to medical students. The laboratory is provided with a valuable set of preparations illustrating the embryology of the lower vertebrates, and a collection of human embryos of various stages from which anatomical and histological preparations are made. Text-Books.âShaefer's, Haddon's, or Minot's Embryology. CHEMISTRY. Professor Mallet. In this course the students are taught Chemical Physics and the general principles of Chemistry, and are carried through a course of Descriptive Chemistry, inorganic and organic; their attention is directed, whenever an occasion presents itself, to the application of chemical principles to Physiology, the Practice of Medicine, Therapeutics, Toxicology, and Sanitary Science. Text-Books.âFownes's Chemistry; Syllabus of the Professor's lectures. For Reference.âCharles's Physiological and Pathological Chemistry; Wormley's Micro-Chemistry of Poisons. PHYSIOLOGY. Professor Barringer. In Physiology the entire work of the class is designed with especial reference to its practical bearings on the subsequent study of Pathology and Therapeutics. The lectures on human Embryology are not given until the students are well advanced in Anatomy, and able to appreciate their bearings. In the elucidation of these subjects, the large collection of plates belonging to the department is supplemented by original preparations and models. Text-Book.âThe Professor's Syllabus. For Reference.âLandois's Physiology; Foster's Physiology. BACTERIOLOGY. Professor Tuttle. Bacteriology is taught by lectures and practical work in the laboratory. It is the object of the course to give the students a clear idea of the biology of the bacteria; their affinities as plants, their structure, and their physiology being considered as the basis for the further discussion of their economic relations, their action as causes of disease, and the methods resorted to for their manipulation. The various processes of bacteriological technique are fully illustrated and demonstrated in the laboratory. The work of the students comprises special practice in those processes which are of peculiar value to the practitioner as a means of diagnosis. Text-Books Recommended.âAbbott's Principles of Bacteriology; Fraenkel's Bacteriology; the Professor's Introduction to the Bacteria; Sternberg's or Crookshank's Manual of Bacteriology. MATERIA MEDICA. Professor Barringer. In Materia Medica and Therapeutics particular stress is laid upon the physiological action and rational therapeutical application of drugs. The physical properties of drugs are taught by requiring the students to learn them from specimens, a complete collection being provided, which contains specimens both of all the crude drugs and of all their preparations which have been dealt with in the lectures. Text-Book.âWhite's Materica Medica and Therapeutics. For Reference.âBrunton's Pharmacology, Wood's Materia Medica. PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. Professor Buckmaster. The Theory and Practice of Medicine is taught in a systematic course of one hundred and fifty didactic lectures, which are supplemented by clinical teaching twice a week. Ample material is furnished by the University Dispensary, and the student is required to become familiar with the normal organs. The additions to our knowledge made by the bacteriologist, when of use in diagnosis or in treatment, receive particular attention. Text-Books.âAn abstract of a course of lectures by William C. Dabney (Anderson Bros., University of Virginia); a Hand-Book of Physical Diagnosis, &amp;c., by R. C. M. Page (J. H. Vail &amp; Co., New York); The Principles and Practice of Medicine, by William Osler (D. Appleton &amp; Co., New York); a Treatise on Mental and Nervous Diseases, by Landon Carter Gray (Lea Bros. &amp; Co., Philadelphia). HYGIENE. Adjunct Professor Davis. In this course the chemical and bacterial contamination of food, water, air and soil first engages the attention of the student. With this preparation he takes up the natural history of contagious and infectious diseases, their modes of propagation and methods of prevention. Instruction is also given in the proper location and construction of habitations, hospitals, schoolhouses, etc., with especial reference to modern methods of heating, ventilating and draining. Notice is taken of the special relations involved in Military and Naval Hygiene. Text-Book.âRohÃ©'s Text-Book of Hygiene. PATHOLOGY. Adjunct Professor Davis. The principles of General and Surgical Pathology are discussed in lectures and illustrated in the laboratory, where ample facilities are provided to enable each student to make permanent preparations for himself. Instruction is also given in the method of conducting a post mortem examination, in which the object of preserving for future investigation such parts, as may demand it, is kept particularly in view. This involves pathological technique, which is accordingly taught. Students are individually required to recognize, by the aid of the microscope, the nature of tumors, and to make examinations of urine, in addition to the regular written examination, covering the entire work of the session. Text-Books.âSenn's Principles of Surgery; Delafield and Prudden's Pathological Anatomy and Histology. SURGERY. Professor Christian. In Operative Surgery the first aim is to ground the student thoroughly in the principles and technique of modern aseptic surgical procedure. All amputations and ligations, the application of splints, bandages and apparatus for different fractures, are shown upon the cadaver. To insure a practical knowledge of the subject, each student will be required to perform operations upon the cadaver as a part of his examination for graduation. OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY. Professor Buckmaster. In Obstetrics instruction is given by lectures, and the mechanical principles involved in the study are explained by the use of suitable preparations and models. The systematic use of the manikin with the fÅtus has made it possible for the student to obtain a knowledge of obstetric manipulations which he can acquire in no other way. Routine work with the manikin is obligatory. Text-Book.âOutlines of Obstetrics, by Charles Jewett (W. B. Saunders, Philadelphia). For Reference.âThe Science and Art of Midwifery, by W. T. Lusk (D. Appleton &amp; Co., New York). In Gynecology instruction is given by lectures and recitations, and the plastic operations necessary to repair injuries of the pelvic structures are shown during the course. Practical training in the details of gynecological treatment is given at the Dispensary. Text-Book.âThe Professor's Syllabus. For Reference.âPrinciples and Practice of Gynecology, by T. A. Emmet (Lea Bros. &amp; Co., Philadelphia); Treatise on the Diseases of Women, by A. J. C. Skene (D. Appleton &amp; Co., New York). MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. Acting Professor Buckmaster. In this course the student is instructed in the principles of the science, and taught how to apply these principles when he is summoned as a witness in a court of law. Text-Book.âReese's Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses of a student in the regular course of the Medical Department for the session of nine months are estimated as below, both for the lowest rate of living and for a more liberal expenditure: Tuition (including fee for laboratory materials), $120 $120 Matriculation, 30 30 Infirmary fee, 7 7 Contingent deposit, 10 10 Dormitory rent, 15 30 Servant's attendance, 9 9 Furniture for dormitory, 9 19 Fuel and lights, 12 24 Washing, 14 14 Board, 99 162 Total necessary expenses, $325 $425 Payable on entrance, 225 265 Books, stationery and dissecting instruments for the entire course cost about $45. The cost of the degree, if taken, is $15. Separate fees are charged when students who are not candidates for a degree pursue an elective instead of the regular course. A laboratory course in Practical Pharmacy, under Professor Dunnington, is also open to medical students, who are charged $5 to cover the cost of laboratory materials, tuition being free. Note.âDuring the session of 1894-'95 the lectures on Obstetrics were given by Thomas R. Evans, M. D.; and lectures on legal aspects of Medical Jurisprudence by Professor W. Minor Lile.

ALBERT H. TUTTLE, M. S., Professor of Botany. PAUL B. BARRINGER, M. D., Professor of Materia Medica. This Department is designed to furnish thorough and practical instruction in Pharmacy and in the sciences on which its principles rest. For this purpose ample facilities are provided in the Academical and Medical Departments, both in the way of teaching and material equipment. COURSE OF INSTRUCTION. The Course of Instruction comprehends the classes of Medical Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry (First Course), Botany, Practical Pharmacy, and Materia Medica. In the course of Analytical Chemistry the Preparation of Medicines and the Detection of Adulterations in Drugs are substituted for Fire Assaying. EQUIPMENT. The Equipment consists of a very complete collection of chemical apparatus for illustrating the lectures on Chemistry; a large and well-arranged Chemical Laboratory, with all the necessary fittings and apparatus; a similar Botanical Laboratory; a museum of Botany and an extensive Herbarium; and a full set of specimens of Materia Medica. DEGREE. The degree of Graduate in Pharmacy is conferred on one who has passed examination in all the above-prescribed subjects of instruction. A well-trained and laborious student will be able to accomplish the work in a single session of nine months. EXPENSES. The necessary Expenses of a student in the Department of Pharmacy, with board at the lowest rate ($11), will be about $315, of which $220 must be paid on entrance. This is exclusive of the cost of books, stationery and chemical apparatus, and of the degree, which costs, if taken, $10. Virginians save $15 in tuition.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Law Department. JOHN B. MINOR, LL. D., Professor of the Law of Real Estate, Pleading and Practice. JAS. H. GILMORE, LL. D., Prof. of Const. and Int'l. Law, Evidence and Equity. W. M. LILE, B. L., Prof. of the Law of Persons, Personal Property, Merc. and Crim. Law. RALEIGH C. MINOR, M. A., B. L., Ass't Prof. of the Law of Real Est., Plead. and Pract. COURSE OF STUDY. The course is arranged for two years, and it is not prudent for the student to devote less time to preparing himself for the practice of the law, since his future professional success depends upon his full mastery of elementary principles. It is a maxim sanctioned by long and wide experience that "he who is not a good lawyer when he comes to the bar, will seldom be a good one afterwards." In order to acquire such thorough acquaintance with the elements of the law, thought is requisite as well as reading; and, for the purpose of thought, there must be time to digest as well as industry to acquire. One cannot expect to gorge himself with legal principles and to digest them afterwards; the process of assimilation must accompany the reception of knowledge, if it is to proceed healthfully and beneficially. The course is organized with a view to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. Especial care is taken to teach him to think for himself, and to rely upon reason and principle, rather than upon memory or impulse; it being considered that it is better for the student to follow the principle to its legitimate conclusion, even though that conclusion be at variance with the decision of the courts, than to arrive at a faultless result by the exercise of memory, or by accident. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through text-books and partly through lectures, with careful daily examinations upon both. MOOT COURT. A Moot Court, with its accompanying instruction, tends to perfect the student in the details of practice. Under the immediate supervision of the Professors, he is required to write opinions upon supposed cases; to draw wills, contracts, conveyances, and other assurances; to devise and institute remedies by suit or otherwise; to conduct actions at law and suits in equity; to argue questions of law and of fact; and, in short, to perform most of the functions of practising counsel. LIBRARY. The department is provided with an excellent law library, to which considerable additions have recently been made, containing several thousand volumes of well-selected reports and text-books, English and American. Its location has been chosen with especial reference to the convenience of the student. And, while he is not encouraged to venture for himself into either cases or text-books, save for the purpose of verifying or clearing up some proposition of the lecture, or for the preparation of opinions or briefs, the student is especially incited to familiarize himself with the bibliography of the law and the use of the books. To this subject, in addition to the instruction incidentally given, several lectures are especially devoted. The student is taught how to look up authorities, where to look, and how to run down cases; how to ascertain the doctrine of a case, and to distinguish it from the dicta; to analyze, criticise and compare cases; how to distinguish imperative authority from that which is persuasive only; what the leading text-books are on the various subjects taught, with some reference to their comparative merits; how to prepare briefs; and, generally, so to accustom himself to law books and their use as to enable him to investigate, with intelligence and skill, any question that may come within the scope of his duty at the bar. ARRANGEMENT OF CLASSES. The Law Department comprises three Schools, each of which is divided into two classes, designated respectively as Junior and Senior. The course of instruction contemplates that two years at the least shall be devoted to its completionâthe first year's course comprising all the Junior classes, and the second year's course all the Senior classes. Heretofore there have been in the entire course twelve lectures weekly, of one and a half hours each. But, at the beginning of the next session (1895-'96), the number will be increased by three additional lectures, making a weekly total of fifteen. This enlargement of the course, together with the increased number of examinations rendered necessary under the recent reorganization of the department, will render it practically impossible to complete the course, as has been not unusual heretofore, in a single year. The subjects to be embraced in the additional lectures have not been fully determined upon, and will be announced later. It is probable that they will be equally divided between the Junior and Senior classes. The following table exhibits an outline of the course (with the exception of the additional subjects yet to be announced) and a list of the text-books used: FIRST YEAR'S COURSE. (JUNIOR CLASSES.) 1. The Law of Pleading and Practice in Civil Cases, Prof. Minor. (R. C. Minor, Assistant.) Text-Book.âVol. IV. Minor's Institutes. 2. Constitutional and International Law, Prof. Gilmore. Text-Books.âVattel's Law of Nations; Professor's Printed Notes; The Federalist; Printed Notes of Professor on the Constitution. 3. The Law of Personal Relations; Personal Property; Contracts; Probate and Administration, Prof. Lile. Text-Books.âVols. I. and III. Minor's Institutes; Printed Notes of Professor. SECOND YEAR'S COURSE. (SENIOR CLASSES.) 1. The Law of Real Estate, Prof. Minor. (R. C. Minor, Assistant.) Text-Book.âVol. II. Minor's Institutes. 2. The Law of Evidence and Equity, Prof. Gilmore. Text-Books.âVol. I. Greenleaf's Evidence; Adams's Equity; Printed Notes of Professor. 3. The Law of Corporations; Negotiable Instruments; Mercantile Law; Criminal Law, Prof. Lile. Text-Books.âMinor's Synopsis of Criminal Law. (Others to be announced.) EXAMINATIONS AND DEGREE. The degree of Bachelor of Law is conferred upon those students who manifest an intimate acquaintance with all of the subjects embraced in the course, evidenced by successfully passing the written examinations, intermediate and final, in each of the six classes. The rule heretofore prevailing in this department has been to require applicants for the degree to attend the lectures in all the classes, and to stand all the regular written examinations on every subject in the course, during the year of their candidacy, without credit for any class completed in a previous yearâexcept in the class of Constitutional and International Law. With the beginning of the session of 1895-'96 a radical departure will be inaugurated, by permitting a candidate to complete a portion of the course in one session and the remainder the following session, without requiring attendance upon the lectures, or further examination, in such classes as he may have previously completed. But a re-examination may be required, whenever, in any case, it may be deemed proper. The enlargement and re-arrangement of the course, as mentioned, calls for an increased number of examinationsâfrom nine, as heretofore, to twelve, under the new system in operation from the beginning of the session of 1895-'96; that is, two examinations, an intermediate and a final, in each class. The general policy of the University is to permit students to elect their own work, and to give them due credit for its satisfactory completion, without regard to the time devoted to it. There is, therefore, no positive rule forbidding students to undertake the whole course in a single year, or withholding from them the degree in case of its successful completion. But the student is warned that unless he has previously had exceptional legal training he can scarcely hope to complete the course in a single year; and if by extreme diligence and industry he should succeed in the effort, he will find that he has acquired more than he has been able to digest. No entrance examinations are held, and the whole course must be completed here. Candidates who attain a standard of seventy-five per centum in any Junior class, but fail to reach the minimum grade required for graduation (eighty-three per centum), are entitled, after matriculation, to stand an examination at the beginning of the following session on the subjects comprised in the class or classes in which they have so failed, and to receive the same credit for the result as if achieved during the previous session. This will enable the earnest student to make up during the summer any deficiency of the previous year, and to go forward with his second year's course, unhampered by work brought over from his first year. Candidates for the degree, who in any session have less than one full year's course to complete, may be required to take such additional work, and to stand such additional examinations, as may be prescribed.

(This schedule does not embrace the additional lectures, which are yet to be arranged.) EXPENSES. The necessary expenses of a student in the Law Department, for the session of nine months, are estimated as below for the lowest rate and for a more liberal scale of living: Tuition, $100 $100 Matriculation, 30 30 Infirmary, 7 7 Contingent deposit, 10 10 Dormitory rent, 15 30 Servant's attendance, 9 9 Furniture for dormitory, 9 19 Fuel and lights, 12 24 Washing, 14 14 Board, 99 162 Total, $305 $405 Payable on entrance, $227 $281 The contingent deposit of $10 is credited in final settlement. This deposit is assessed for damage to property, violation of library rules, etc., by the student. To the above estimate must be added the cost of books and stationery, about $80 for the entire course, and the cost of the diploma, if taken, $15. The books are not fairly to be accounted amongst the expenses, since they constitute a permanent investment, and will form the nucleus of a library when the student becomes a practitioner. The tuition fee of $100 covers the charges for the regular first or second year's course, including any Junior class taken the first year, but not completed, and brought over into the second year. It also covers any other combination of three classes. For more than three classes the fee is $115; for two classes, $75; for one class, $40. Mr. James B. Green, B. L. (U. Va., 1871), acts as Licentiate Instructor in the Law Department.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">FAYERWEATHER GYMNASIUM.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Physical Culture. WILLIAM A. LAMBETH, M. D., Director of the Gymnasium. The work offered in Physical Training and the privileges of the Gymnasium, with the services of the Director, are given free of cost to every regularly-matriculated student of the University. The exercises, whether individual or concerted, are optional, but all students are advised to take advantage of at least the regular class exercises. These are arranged at such hours as not to encroach upon time which should be spent in lecture or study, and include instruction in all forms of gymnastic apparatus, and in boxing, wrestling and fencing. Advice as to the use of various appliances is given upon the basis of a thorough physical examination, and with a view to securing uniform physical development. The Fayerweather Gymnasium, of which the exterior appearance is shown in the accompanying cut, provides in the basement baths of all kinds, with cold and hot water, a swimming-pool, locker, and bowling alleys. On the first floor are the main exercise-hall and the various offices, and in the gallery above are the running-track and a loft for spectators. The supply of apparatus is ample and of the best quality. The Campus, adjacent to the Gymnasium, and the Athletic Field, on the southern side of the grounds, furnish ample space for foot-ball, base-ball, tennis, and track-athletics. The former contains a well-drained and ballasted quarter-mile running track; on the latter the exhibition games of foot-ball and base-ball are held. Athletics among the students are under the special direction of the General Athletic Association, an organization of students whose object is to promote this class of physical exercises. The Faculty, by means of its Gymnasium Committee, exercises only a general advisory control, endeavoring to foresee and avert dangerous tendencies or unwise excesses in physical exercises, while giving to the students, as far as possible, entire liberty of management. But a strict limit is placed upon the character of intercollegiate games and the number played away from the University, and students are not allowed to play upon the University ball teams except after examination by the Director of the Gymnasium and with his approbation.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Expenses. The University Fees paid by all students in the regular courses are for the entire session of nine months, as follows: Department. Academic. Law. Medicine. Pharmacy. Engineering Agriculture. Matriculation $ 30 $ 30 $ 30 $ 30 $ 30 $ 30 Infirmary 7 7 7 7 7 7 Contingent 10 10 10 10 10 10 Tuition 75 100 120 120 100 100 Total $122 $147 $167 $167 $147 $147 Reduced charges to Virginians 47 142 97 47 The contingent deposit of $10 is credited in the final settlement. The Living Expenses of the student vary with the cost of the board, which is $11 a month at the Mess Club, $16 at Mrs. Elsom's hotel, $17 at Mrs. Gunther's hotel, and from $16 to $20 at private boarding-houses; and depend also upon whether the student shares his dormitory with a room-mate or is the sole occupant. The following estimates are for the lowest and highest ordinary rates: Dormitory rent, $15 $ 30 Servant's attendance, 9 9 Furniture for dormitory, 9 19 Fuel and lights, 12 24 Washing, 14 14 Board, 99 162 Total, $158 $258 Board at the University hotels is deposited with the Proctor, and must be paid monthly in advance; but the student may change his hotel at the end of any fiscal month on application to the Chairman. The Total Necessary Expenses for the session of nine months vary, therefore, between the following limits for the regular courses, exclusive of books, stationery, laboratory materials, etc.: Department. Regular Charges. Charges to Virginians. Academic, $280â$380 $205â$305 Law, 305â 405 305â 405 Medicine, 325â 425 325â 425 Pharmacy, 325â 425 310â 410 Engineering, 305â 405 255â 355 Agriculture, 305â 405 205â 305 For Special Courses the tuition fee varies, its amount being made up from the following list; the charges for apparatus (indicated in parentheses) is contingent on the amount of breakage, and may be greater or less than the average stated. Starred (*) courses include the charges for laboratory materials. In Graduate Chemistry the fee for materials varies according to the work done. Applied Mathematics, $ 50 Agricultural Chemistry, 15 Analytical Chemistry ($15), 100* Analytical Chemistry, first course ($10), 60* Anglo-Saxon, 15 Assaying ($10), 50* Biology and Agriculture, 45* Botany, 20* Determinative Mineralogy ($5), 20* General Biology, 35* Graduate Chemistry ($10), 50* Mechanical Drawing, 10 Practical Physics, 10* Shop Work, 20* Lawâone class, 40 Lawâtwo classes, $75 Lawâthree classes, 100 Lawâfull course, 115 Medical Chemistry, 25 Medical Biology, 35* Anatomy, 35* Physiology, 25 Practice, 20 Surgery, 20 Materia Medica, 20 Gynecology and Obstetrics, 20 Medical Jurisprudence, 10 Hygiene, 10 Pathology, 10* Clinics, 10 Except as above stated, the tuition fee for one School is $50; for two Schools, $60; for three or more, $25 each. All of the foregoing items are payable on entrance, except board and washing. An abatement of one-third in fees for matriculation, dormitory rent, infirmary and tuition, is made to students who enter after December 15th; two-thirds after March 15th. For Degrees the fees are as follows, payable on or before May 1st, and returned if the degree is not conferred: Proficient in a Class, $2 50 Graduate in a B. A. Course, 2 50 Graduate in a School, 5 00 Bachelor of Law, $15 00 Doctor of Medicine, 15 00 For the other Titled Degrees no charge is made if the previous Untitled Degrees have been taken and paid for. Payments for separate School diplomas are credited in the settlement for the Titled Degree. Privileged Students.âMinisters of the gospel may attend any of the Literary or Scientific Schools of the University without the payment of tuition fees. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students. The license to contract debts, which the Chairman is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity; and these, it is hoped, parents and guardians will prevent, as far as possible, by a timely supply of the requisite funds.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scholarships and Fellowships. Eleven University Scholarships are open to new-comers from all the States at the beginning of the academic year; five are in the Academical Department and two each in the Departments of Law, Medicine, and Engineering. The scholarship awards are based upon a competitive examination held during the first week of the session, embracing papers in English, Latin, Greek, and Mathematics. The right is reserved to reject any papers that do not reach a standard of three-fourths. The emoluments are free tuition and matriculation. The value of one of these scholarships to the successful competitor is, in the Academical Department, $100 to $150; in the Law, $110; in Medicine, $130; in Engineering, $130. The subjects assigned for examination in September, 1895, are as follows: English.âSwinton's Grammar and Composition; Hart's Rhetoric, or equivalent. Greek.âXenophon's Memorabilia, Books i. and ii.; Lysias, Against Eratosthenes; Grammar and Composition. Latin.âLivy, Books i. and ii.; Cicero, Against Catiline; Grammar and Composition.

The Miller Scholarship is awarded by the Faculty on conditions prescribed under the Agricultural Department of Virginia. The McCormick Scholarship, established in honor of the founder of the Astronomical Observatory, is awarded by Mr. McCormick. The emoluments are free tuition and matriculation. The Thompson Brown Scholarship is awarded by the founder. The Isaac Carey Scholarships are awarded by the Carey Trustees. The Birely Scholarship, founded upon the bequest of the late Mrs. Evalena Seevers Birely in honor of her husband, Valentine Birely, Esq., of Frederick, Md., is awarded by the Visitors to some student from the State of Maryland. The John Y. Mason Fellowship, founded upon the gift of Archer Anderson, Esq., of Richmond, Va., is awarded by the Visitors to some competent and deserving post-graduate student.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Societies of Students. There are two Literary Societies of long standingâthe Jefferson Society and the Washington Societyâconnected with the University. They meet weekly in their respective halls and hold public exhibitions at intervals during the session and at its close. The two Societies jointly maintain the University Magazine, and annually invite some distinguished orator to deliver an address before them in the Public Hall at the close of the session. In each Society medals are givenâone to the best debater, another to the best orator, and a third medal is awarded for the best original contribution to the University Magazine by a member of either Society. The Temperance Union also, in addition to its ordinary functions, is frequently organized as a debating Society, and confers medals or other valuable prizes. MEDALISTS. 1893-'94. Jefferson Society Orator, Hugh M. Dorsey, Va. University Magazine Medalist, J. Spottiswoode Taylor, Va. Washington Society Orator, Edward L. Greever, Va. Washington Society Debater, Charles R. Frankum, Va. PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY. This Society has its membership mainly among the Professors, Instructors, and Post-graduate students of the University. It meets monthly for the reading of papers of scientific and literary interest, the exhibition of experiments, and discussion. All members of the University are eligible to membership. There are no initiation fees or annual dues. The following is the list of papers presented during 1894: N. K. Davis, on Theism. N. K. Davis, on Infinity. F. P. Dunnington, on The Odor of Artificial Ice. James M. Garnett, The Apocalypse of St. Paul. M. W. Humphreys, on The Trial of Sophocles. J. W. Mallet, on Carborundum. W. J.

The following publications are issued, either under the auspices of the University or by professors or students of the school: The Alumni Bulletin, a quarterly journal, published by a committee of the Faculty, and designed to advance the interests of the University and its Alumni and to form a permanent record of its history. The Annals of MathematicsâEditor-in-chief, Professor Ormond Stone. A journal of pure and applied mathematics. Each annual volume contains six numbers. The University of Virginia Magazine, designed to encourage literary work among the students; published each month during the session by the Literary Societies. The College Topics, a weekly newspaper, published under the auspices of the General Athletic Association, devoted to the interests of Athletics and the University at large. Corks and Curls, an annual volume, published under the auspices of the Greek Letter fraternities. The Y. M. C. A. Hand-book, an annual pocket-book of useful information concerning the University, published for gratuitous distribution by the Christian Association.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Regulations. 1. Admission.âThe age of the student must be at least sixteen years. A certificate of honorable discharge from the school last attended, or other evidence of general good conduct, is required. The student must matriculate in at least three academical schools, or their equivalent, except by special order of the Faculty. 2. Dormitory.âThe occupant of a dormitory has first right to it, and may reserve it for the next session by registration with the Proctor before the end of the current session; thereafter any vacant dormitory is assigned to the first applicant. But unless a deposit of fifteen dollars is made with the Proctor on or before September 1st, the room is forfeited. No dormitory may be sub-let or used for other than its proper purpose. 3. Boarding.âStudents may board and lodge either in the University precincts, or at their homes, or in houses licensed by the Faculty. It is the duty of the Chairman to withdraw the license from any house, in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Change of lodging should be reported at the Chairman's office. 4. Change of Schools, with transfer of fees, may be made by the student within one week after registration: thereafter it is permitted only by special order of the Fac ulty. But a student may change from one class to another of the same school with the advice and consent of the professors concerned. 5. Absence from the University is permitted upon the written leave of the student's professors and the Chairman, obtained in every case in advance. But leaves of absence for the purpose of accompanying the athletic teams or the musical clubs on excursions will not be granted, except to the officers and members of the organizations. 6. Absence from Lecture may be excused by the professors, but only for sickness or like providential cause. Such excuses should be rendered at the first lecture attended after the absence. The Chairman is required to present for discipline every student charged with eight or more unexcused absences in all classes during either half-session, that is, before or after midnight of January 31st. 7. Absence from Examination will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination (attested by the physician's certificate) or other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. In such cases a special examination will be granted, but in no other. 8. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the student's professors and of the Chairman. When the permit is granted upon the physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of the student's ill-health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are returned pro rata. 9. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the Faculty for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault, which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. 10. Conduct.âDrunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the Chairman is instructed to dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them. Profane swearing, habits of expense, visiting bar-rooms or gaming tables, the use or possession of fire-arms or other deadly weapons, the unauthorized contraction of debts, and the use by the student in his lodgings or in the University precincts of intoxicating drinks, except on prescription of the University physician, are also violations of University law, and punishable by admonition or suspension. In all cases of discipline the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defence. ATHLETICS. 1. The Faculty Committee on the Gymnasium is entrusted with the general oversight of field and track athletics, and is authorized to forbid any features in these exercises which endanger the health or the morals of the participants. 2. No one shall be a member of any University athletic team, or act as such in any intercollegiate contest, who is not at the time of such contest a regularly matriculated student or an instructor in the University. 3. No student will be permitted to play upon the University foot-ball and base-ball teams except after physical examination by the Director of the Gymnasium, and with his approbation. 4. Leave of absence for the purpose of playing intercollegiate match games may be allowed to the base-ball and foot-ball teams, such leaves not to exceed four days in the session in the case of either team. 5. No student under twenty-one years old will be permitted to play with either team in games away from the University, either as a regular member of the team or as a substitute, except upon written permission from his parent or guardian, addressed to the Chairman of the Faculty. 6. Only students who act as regular or substitute members of the athletic teams will be permitted to accompany them on trips away from the University, except during vacations and holidays. 7. Any member of an athletic team who is reported for neglect of his studies or nonattendance on lectures may be required by the Faculty to sever his connection with such team. 8. The athletic teams shall not have contests elsewhere than upon the University grounds with any except teams from other institutions of learning. 9. Experts for purposes of instruction and professional teams for purposes of practice may be employed on the University grounds, but only with written permission from the Chairman of the Faculty. 10. The foregoing regulations shall be applicable also, mutatis mutandis, to Musical Clubs.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">Young Men's Christian Association. This was founded in 1858, and is the oldest of the College Christian Associations. Its object is to promote the religious and moral welfare of the students by furnishing opportunities for religious work in and near the University, and facilities for various kinds of healthful recreation and instruction. Under the former head it conducts Sunday-schools at the University and among the poor of the neighboring mountains, carries on a system of central and district weekly prayer-meetings, and arranges for courses of Bible-study under the direction of competent and experienced teachers. Under the latter head it publishes a compact and useful Students' Hand-Book to the University, secures periodical public lectures and discourses, conducts the Students' Reading-Room, and has purchased and put into a high state of improvement a valuable field near the Fayerweather Gymnasium as a free Campus for athletic sports. The Students' Reading-Room is convenient of access, comfortably arranged and furnished, and supplied with a large selection of the best periodical literature. It is open to all members of the University upon the payment of an annual fee of $2 to meet its current expenses. The Visitors and the Faculty of the University heartily commend the good work of this Association to the students of the University, all of whom are invited to unite in its membership and privileges. During the year 1894 the following valuable series of discourses upon the Evidences of Christianity was delivered under the auspices of the Association: 1. "The Unity of the Old and New Testament Scriptures," by Bishop J. C. Granberry, D. D., of the Southern Methodist Episcopal Church. 2. "The Historic Christ," by Rt. Rev. Thomas U. Dudley, D. D., Bishop of Kentucky, Protestant Episcopal Church. 3. "Jesus teaching Nicodemus," and "The Truth of the Old Testament proven by the New," by Rev. John A. Broadus, D. D., President of the Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville, Ky. 4. "Jesus the Supreme Teacher," and "The Sad Tone of Infidel Literature," by Rev. Moses D. Hoge, D. D., of the Southern Presbyterian Church. 5. Two discourses on the "Testimony of the Monuments to the Truth of Revelation," by Rev. Walter W. Moore, D. D., Professor in the Union Theological Seminary, H.-S. College, Va.</field>
