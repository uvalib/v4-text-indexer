      <field name="fulltext">Third Annual Report of the Archivist, University of Virginia Library, for the Year 1932-33 THE momentum gained from the two preceding years' work in surveying and collecting historical materials in Virginia has been an appreciable factor in facilitating the progress during the year just completed. As prolonged economic distress has resulted in increasing demands upon research organizations and special and general libraries of all kinds, albeit with incomes drastically reduced, so the need for preserving the raw materials in manuscript and printed form is more generally recognized. While the specific task must rest upon the local agency, adapted to the peculiar conditions and problems of the region, it is encouraging to find the preservation of social science source materials advocated on a nation-wide scale by the American Library Association and to see quickened the perennial interest of the Public Archives Commission, under the direction of the American Historical Association, as evidenced by its report on the preservation of local archives.1 1. The Preservation of Local Archives. A Guide for Public Officials. Prepared by the Public Archives Commission [A. R. Newsome, Chairman] under the direction of the American Historical Association (Washington, D. C. 1932). "There is evidence," as one scholar observes, "that in America we have come to the end of an era, and it is desirable that the period that is closing be as completely documented as possible."2 2. A. F. Kuhlman in American Library Association, Bulletin vol. XXVII no. 3 (Mar. 1933), page 130. The routine work of taking inventory of official records in the clerks' offices of counties and cities and of locating church registers and other semi-private sources has proceeded, though at a slower pace, according to the program outlined a year ago.3 3. Second Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1931-32 (University, Va., 1932), page 5. The survey was extended into the following counties during 1932-33: In Tidewater—Lancaster, Surry, and Westmoreland. In Piedmont—Amherst, Cumberland, and Fauquier. In Southside Virginia—Charlotte. In Southwestern Virginia—Montgomery. As more communities are visited and more contacts made the collecting of manuscripts for the University Library, combined purposely with the survey work, requires an increasing proportion of the time for both tasks. Since the possibilities in each county are never exhausted, the trails leading to old and to newly discovered collections cross and recross, bringing increasing demands upon the archivist's time. The concentration upon newspaper collections this year, of which more will be said presently, has required much additional time. The ultimate value, however, of a consistent county-by-county survey is not to be gainsaid, nor is this phase of the work less fundamental because its completion may be somewhat delayed. Indeed, these inventories are rediscovering in the clerks' offices not only official records never before used by historians, but also old manuscript books of a private nature which evidently served as exhibits in suits years ago. Among such records in Orange County were found two blacksmith's account books for 1820-21, a private account book including farms sold and for sale, 1901-07, and the constitution and proceedings of the Orange Union Agricultural Society, 1842-48. These books from Orange County have been placed in the University Library as a loan deposit from the county. Records of a similar nature are on deposit from Albemarle and Essex and negotiations with several other counties are pending. The compilation of a check-list of Virginia newspapers has been under way since the work of the archivist began.4 4. First Annual Report of the Archivist . . . 1930-31 (University, Va., 1931), pages 4-5. The plan, projected last year,5 5. Second Annual Report of the Archivist, page 3. to publish this material as Part I of the Guide to Virginia historical sources has now materialized and the data will be prepared for the press next year. The need of building up files of Virginia papers in the University Library has diverted the archivist's attention from the more routine aspects of the survey and effort has been made to obtain representative files, or scattered numbers at least, from various sections of the State. Numerous contacts with present and former editors, their descendants, and old residents have netted gratifying returns. The Library has acquired, entirely by gift, many files (of a year or more) of county papers, some obscure, others of considerable local importance, from such widely scattered towns as Bedford, Boydton, Buena Vista, Christiansburg, Culpeper, Front Royal, Lawrenceville, Lexington, South Boston, Surry, Warrenton, and Wakefield. Most of these date from 1880 or later, but a considerable number of broken files or scattered numbers date from ante bellum days or the reconstruction period. While the Library has some files of leading dailies, the little county weekly is to be more prized for its rarity and its intimate reflection of local conditions. The increasing appreciation of newspapers as indispensable source material and more particularly of the need for check-lists such as the present one is attested to in the findings of a Committee of the American Historical Association on the Planning of Research. Among the needs in the field of American history they list "the preparation of a descriptive historical guide to selected American newspapers."6 6. Historical Scholarship in America: Needs and Opportunities. A Report by the Committee of the American Historical Association on the Planning of Research [A. M. Schlesinger, Chairman] (New York, 1932), page 24. The proposed list of Virginia papers is to be more than a guide to files and single issues in libraries in this State; it will include files in Virginia editors' offices and, of special interest to the scholar beyond the borders of the State, files in leading repositories throughout the United States. In this respect this check-list will supplement the excellent Bibliography of American Newspapers, 1690-1820, compiled by Dr. Clarence S. Brigham of the American Antiquarian Society.7 7. Published in the Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society: "Part XVIII: Virginia-West Virginia," Apr. 1927, pages 63-162. The present list will bring up to date the Virginia material in such compilations as those of the Library of Congress (1901 and 1912), State Historical Society of Wisconsin (1911 and 1918), Virginia State Library (1912), etc. A general historical introduction is contemplated and brief biographical notes on many of the editors. The steady growth of the manuscript collection in the University Library will inevitably serve as a stimulus to research in all the social sciences and, it is believed, in other fields as well. It is never too soon to collect original papers (even those dealing with recent events, when their use may be restricted or forbidden until a specified time has elapsed) and it is frequently too late. No manuscript is rejected because, as the prospective donor often remarks, it is "of no interest" or "only personal" or "not old enough." Even when library space is limited, it is dangerous business to declare ex cathedra what has historical value and what has not, and, in any circumstances, who shall judge what the scholars of future generations will prize most highly or regard as most trivial? The writings of great and lesser leaders are seized upon by the antiquarian, and the curio-hunter will covet at least their autographs, but the papers of obscure persons and organizations frequently afford the trained scholar a significant point or a bit of atmosphere that has long escaped him. (How the student of agrarianism cherishes the fragmentary letter of a poor tenant farmer!) Since no funds have been available for the purchase of manuscripts, they have been obtained either as gifts or as loan deposits which are relatively permanent acquisitions. Among the gifts of the past year are the Perkins Letters from Cumberland County, written to a soldier by his wife during the Civil War; the Jones Papers from Surry County —letters by veterans of the Surry Light Artillery to their comrade, B. J. Jones,8 8. Cf. his Under the Stars and Bars; a History of the Surry Light Artillery . . . (Richmond, 1909). ca. 1900, and weather reports kept by Jones for the Weather Bureau, 1890-1910; Nicholas P. Trist's copies of Jefferson and Madison letters (most of them already published),9 9. In the Memorial Edition of Jefferson's Writings (1903-04). some unpublished notes of his own, and some contemporary newspapers—all bearing on the nullification controversy and its political and constitutional background; a Jefferson letter (1811) and a William G. Pendleton letter concerning the medical school of the University of Virginia (1833); the letters (foreign and domestic) and accounts of H. J. Rhodes, tobacconist at Cartersville, Cumberland County, on the James, ca. 1890-1920; the papers of Dr. W. M. Seward of Brunswick County, including some fragmentary manuscripts on the Petersburg and Weldon Railroad, ca. 1830; a small group of papers of William Mullen, pioneer supporter of the Knights of Labor in Virginia and editor of the first labor newspaper in the State.10 10. Labor Herald, Richmond, established ca. 1882. On deposit in the Library are the Edmund Berkeley Manuscripts, consisting of legal documents and letters of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (to 1788) and the orders of the vestry of Christ Church Parish, 21 October 1765 (copy); another consignment of Anderson Papers,11 11. Cf. Second Annual Report of the Archivist, page 4. containing more material on the debt controversy in the famous case of Virginia vs. West Virginia; the Day-Martin Papers from Isle of Wight County, 1890-1920, including some papers of Senator Thomas L. Martin; the letters of William Couper, Scotch immigrant in Norfolk, to his family in Scotland, 1801-45, describing in entertaining fashion social and economic conditions in his adopted city. These letters are loaned for the express purpose of photostating. From Rockbridge County comes an interesting book of autographs of members of Congress, collected by one of their colleagues in 1842 and presented "to Miss Glasgow." In addition to these papers the Library's collection of business records has been augmented by the account books of grist mills in Albemarle, Amelia, and Nelson counties; hardware firms in Charlotte County and Warrenton; a drug and general store in Nelson County; the Cumberland Tobacco Warehouse, Cumberland Court House; a distillery and blacksmithing business in Fauquier County; and general stores in Charlotte Court House and Buchanan, Va. These records vary greatly in extent and date from ca. 1820 to 1920. The question of photostating important manuscripts which cannot be obtained for the Library is raised ever more frequently. Hitherto relatively little has been done because the Library has no such machine of its own and because the funds for operating the Virginia Room are meager. Practically, the photostat is as useful as the original to the scholar, and owners of manuscripts are learning that the existence of photostats does not necessarily lessen the market value of the originals. From time to time interesting letters or diaries or ephemeral papers come to hand only long enough to be copied and then virtually pass out of existence. Since the opportunity to make copies may come but once, it is urgently recommended that a fund for this special purpose be budgeted. In the preceding report of the archivist the status of church records in Virginia was discussed at length.12 12. Second Annual Report of the Archivist, page 2. During the past year the proposed Methodist Historical Society was organized. One of its functions will be the preservation of the churches' original records, perhaps in a central repository in Richmond. Meanwhile, in accordance with the action of the Charlottesville District Conference,13 13. Ibid., pages 2-3. a number of churches in this area have deposited their records in the University Library for safe-keeping until the Methodist Historical Society provides a place. The co-operation of the archivist has been invited by the president of the Society,14 14. Professor E. L. Fox of Randolph-Macon College, Ashland, Va. and it has been suggested that aid and advice be solicited from the Methodist Historical Society of Maryland which has been active for many years. Since the Baltimore Conference includes churches in Northern Virginia, it is hoped that their records may be kept in the State through the co-operation of the two historical societies. In addition to the material obtained on other churches through the survey by counties, the questionnaire method was used, with moderate success, to obtain data on the churches in West Hanover Presbytery; several unpublished historical sketches were also received. The historical importance of the Established Church during the colonial period, the decadence of the Episcopal Church after the Revolution, and its revival by the mid-nineteenth century render its records of special interest. Those of the colonial period which have survived are being published by the Virginia State Library,15 15. Thirteen had already been published when the State Library took up the task in 1931. Cf. C. G. Chamberlayne, ed., The Vestry Book of Stratton Major Parish, King and Queen County, Virginia, 1729-1783 (Richmond, 1931), pages xiii-xviii. but a few of the eighteenth century and most of the nineteenth are still in the parishes. The archivist plans to devote some special attention to a survey of all these records, presenting a cross-section of the materials of this important church and perhaps making accessible some hitherto unknown. From a wide variety of sources have come annual reports, bulletins, pamphlets, and unpublished sketches—the raw materials of social history which, until recent years, were seldom regarded as having historical value. In a few instances printing houses have generously given of their duplicate stock of pamphlets. Of special value is a gift from Norfolk of a set of directories of that city, 1869-70, 1875-1925. From several individuals the Library has received books on Virginia and the South, long out of print, and files of important periodicals. Recently the archivist has obtained duplicates of the Acts of the General Assembly of Virginia (some as early as 1830) and of other state documents, long stored away in the county clerks' offices. These documents are to be used on exchange with other states, especially in the South, to build up sets of their publications in the University Library. Within Virginia the policy of co-operation among libraries, set forth in the previous reports of the archivist,16 16. Second Annual Report of the Archivist, page 5. was further stressed at the meeting of the Virginia Library Association last November. The development of state-wide interest in the preservation of historical materials, in the broadest meaning of the phrase, is an objective that permits of no selfish aggrandizement but embraces all active agencies in the promotion of scholarship. The progress of similar organizations undertaking manuscript surveys in Pennsylvania and New York State17 17. Ibid., pages 5-6. is evidenced by the publications they have issued18 18. Inventory of the Manuscript and Miscellaneous Collections of the Historical Society of Western Pennsylvania, Western Pennsylvania Historical Survey, Bibliographical Contributions, No. 1 (Pittsburgh, Penna., Jan. 1933)—mimeographed; New York Historical Association, Bulletin from Headquarters House (Ticonderoga, May 1933)—multigraphed. and by communications from time to time with the directors. At Headquarters House, Ticonderoga, New York, Dr. Julian P. Boyd is in charge of the work sponsored by the New York Historical Association. Between him and the archivist the policy of directing historical materials back to the state of their origin (from New York to Virginia and vice versa) has been put into practice. In Kentucky, the collection of source materials was begun last year by Professor T. D. Clark of the University of Kentucky, and exchange relations are being established between that institution and the University of Virginia. The preparation for publication of the data on Virginia newspapers, previously discussed,19 19. See above, pages 2-3. will require so considerable a portion of the time next year as to necessitate a reduction in county survey work. The following counties and city are slated for 1933-34 (including those remaining from the past year): In Tidewater—Gloucester County. On the Eastern Shore—Accomac County. In the Piedmont—Lynchburg. In the Valley—Rockbridge and Shenandoah counties. In Southside Virginia—Brunswick and Halifax counties. In Southwestern Virginia—Russell County. As the work becomes more involved each succeeding year, the need for an assistant, to relieve the archivist of much of the routine, grows more imperative. It is suggested that the assistant might be employed part-time in the Virginia Room, where the curator needs help in handling and making accessible the steadily increasing manuscript material. The cordial interest of countless men and women throughout the state and the co-operation of the University Library staff and of members of the faculty have been a constant incentive in carrying on the work. Thanks are due to all those who have so willingly entrusted their manuscripts and printed records to the University of Virginia. And, for their counsel and encouragement, the archivist is particularly indebted to Mr. Harry Clemons, Librarian, and Dr. Wilson Gee, Director of the Institute for Research in the Social Sciences. Lester J. Cappon, Archivist. 1 August 1933.</field>
