      <field name="fulltext">TERMS OF ADMISSION. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. MATRICULATION. To be admitted as a student of the University, the applicant must be at least sixteen years of age; but the Faculty may dispense with this requirement in favor of one who has a brother of the requisite age entering at the same time. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he must produce a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence of general good conduct. In this institution there is no curriculum or prescribed course of study to be pursued by every student, whatever his previous preparation or special objects. In establishing the University of Virginia, Mr. Jefferson, for the first time in America, threw open the doors of a University in the true sense of the name, providing, as amply as the available means would permit, for thorough instruction in independent schools in all the chief branches of learning, assuming that the opportunities for study thus presented were privileges to be voluntarily and eagerly sought, and allowing students to select for themselves the departments to which they are led by their special tastes and proposed pursuits in life. The wisdom of this plan has been amply vindicated by time and experience; and within the last few years many of the institutions of higher culture in the United States have, to a greater or less extent, remodelled their method of study in accordance with the example here set. This elective system commends itself especially to those who desire to make professional attainments in any departments of knowledge. At the same time, the courses of academic study are so arranged as to provide for the systematic prosecution of a complete plan of general education. TERMS OF ADMISSION. While every student may thus select the schools he will attend, in the academic department he is required to attend at least three, unless, upon the written request of his parent or guardian, or for good cause shown, the Faculty shall allow him to attend less than three. Students are permitted to exchange schools, with transfer of fees, within ONE WEEK after admission; thereafter no exchange is allowed, except by leave of the Faculty, and then without transfer of fees. The session commences on the 1st of October, and continues without interruption until the Thursday before the 4th of July. The mode of instruction is by lectures and text-books, accompanied by daily examinations. NO HONORARY DEGREES ARE CONFERRED BY THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. LITERARY DEPARTMENT. LIST OF PROFESSORS. W.

This class is composed of students who have graduated in the school of Latin, and who desire a wider acquaintance with Latin than is implied in graduation. Authors not embraced in the regular course are read and closely studied. Special attention is given to translation: and a prominent feature of the lecture-room exercises is the discussion by members of the class of the text translated. The vocabulary acquired by extensive translation is frequently applied in rendering into Latin English selected for the purpose. Sanskrit. The Professor of Latin will also give instruction in Sanskrit. SCHOOL OF GREEK. Prof. Price. The school is divided into three classesâJunior, Intermediate, and Senior.

It embraces Applications of the Differential and Integral Calculus to selected portions of Mechanics, Physics, and Physical Astronomy. There is one class in Mixed Mathematics. Text-Books.âPrice's Infinitesimal Calculus, Vols. III and IV. In the class of Mixed Mathematics there are two Lectures each week. The instruction in each class in the School of Mathematics is conveyed partly by lectures and partly by the systematic study of approved text-books. The student is assisted by full and frequent explanations from the Professor, and constantly subjected to rigid examinations. The progress of the student in each class is also tested by his being required to perform written exercises, in which the principles acquired are applied to the solution of particular problems. Any student entering the school has the privilege of attending all or any of the classes, and if prepared to enter an advanced class, may often find it highly advantageous to review his previous studies by attendance on a lower class also. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. SCHOOL OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. Prof. Smith. This School includes two departmentsâGeneral Physics and Practical Physics. I. General Physics. Junior Class.âThe Junior Class meets three times in each week throughout the session of nine months. The object of the course of lectures to this class is to furnish the student with a comprehensive view of Modern Physics, and to make him familiar with its methods of investigation. With the design of laying a thoroughly scientific basis for the course, a large space is given at the outset to the discussion of the cardinal doctrines of motion, force, energy, and potential, and to their simpler applications in the pressure and motion of visible masses. With this preparation the student proceeds to the subject of Molecular Physics, embracing Sound, Light, Heat, and Electricity. Throughout the course the established laws of motion and force are kept steadily in view, and an attempt is made to exhibit the evidence, daily becoming stronger and clearer, for the prevalent belief among scientists, that the entire body of Physics is a coherent and harmonious system of mechanical truth. Text-Books.âThe Professor's Syllabus; Everett's Units and Physical Constants. For Reference.âTreatises by Clerk Maxwell; Jamin; Daguin. Senior Class.âThis class meets thrice each week, and studies Mathematical Physics and Astronomy.

The collections of the University in illustration of the processes and products of Industrial Chemistry have been procured with SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT.. much expense and pains in this country, England, France, and Germany, and are unusually extensive and goodâamongst the best on this side of the Atlantic. SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL AND AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. Prof. Mallet. Adjunct Prof. Dunnington. Instruction in this school is given in the following courses: In Analytical Chemistry, while the chief portion of the teaching is necessarily personal, there are three classes: I. The first class meets twice each week during the session, on each occasion spending from three to four hours in practical experiments in the laboratory. A regularly arranged course of practice in chemical manipulation is first pursued, which is followed by a systematic course of qualitative analysis, in which students are taught to determine, by themselves, the constituents of substances presented to them. Special attention is given to substances having useful applications in the arts or connected with agriculture. In the course of this work they are familiarized with the methods of blow-pipe analysis, and enabled to identify minerals by their physical and blow-pipe characters, aided by other simple chemical tests. The elements of practical assaying are taught by their making fire assays of lead, silver, and gold ores. Toward the close of the session, the elements of quantitative analysis are taught, as far as the limitation of time will permit. II. The second class have access to the laboratory for six days in the week, during the whole of the working hours of each day. In addition to the work of the first class, given above, they pursue an extended course of quantitative analysis, determining the composition of substances, such as ores, minerals, clays, soils, building-stones, manures, technical products, etc., and are thus afforded a full course of instruction in practical chemistry. Students will be assisted and encouraged to undertake original research. III. The third class is one specially intended for students of medicine, and will meet for lessons of two hours each, twice in the week, for two months of the session. To this class the practical applications of chemistry SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. to medicine will be taught, the detection of poisons, chemical and microscopical examination of animal products, urine, blood, etc. Among the works recommended to laboratory students are: Freseniusâ"Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis;" H. Roseâ"Handbuch der Analytischen Chemie" (also in French translation); Greville Williamsâ"Handbook of Chemical Manipulation;" Woehlerâ"Examples for Practice in Chemical Analysis;" Von Kobellâ"Tafeln zur Bestimmung der Mineralien" (also in English translation); Bolleyâ"Handbuch der technisch-chemischen Untersuchungen;" Odlingâ"Practical Chemistry for Medical Students;" A.

Besides the above, there is also a class in Practical Pharmacy, specially intended for medical students, which receives fourteen lessons during the latter half of the session. Text-Books.âParrish's Pharmacy; with Wood's and Bache's "United States Dispensatory," for reference. In Agricultural Chemistry there is one class, to which lectures are delivered once a week throughout the session; or, when found more convenient to students of agriculture, a larger number of lectures per week will be given during a part of the year only. In this course the chemical and physical properties of soils, of the atmosphere, and of plants, chemistry of the processes of vegetable life and growth, the composition and chemical preparation of manures, etc., will be discussed. Text-Books.âS. W. Johnsonâ"How Crops Grow," and "How Crops Feed." For reference: J. F. W. Johnston and C. A. Cameronâ"Elements of Agricultural Chemistry and Geology" (12th edition); R.

Farmers who are not regular students of the University, but may desire to attend this special course, are freely invited to do so. Very liberal provision has been made in the way of material arrangements for the teachings of this Chair. A new laboratory building of ample size, specially designed for the purpose of working students, has been erected, containing all necessary rooms, fitted with double windows for the preservation of uniform temperature, and amply supplied with gas, water, and all proper laboratory fixtures; and all needful apparatus, chemicals, minerals, materials for analysis, etc., have been imported from Europe in abundance. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. MILLER SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE, ZOOLOGY, AND BOTANY. Prof. John R. Page. This school is divided into three classes, viz: Agriculture, Zoology, and Botany. Class I.âAgriculture. This course is divided into two parts, Scientific and Practical. 1. The Scientific course comprises a review of what is known of the chemical composition, the structure and the functions of the organs of plants; and of the atmosphere and soil, as related to vegetable production. 2. The course on Practical Agriculture comprises the study of the nature and formation of soils; their exposure and drainage; the best methods of tillage; and the use of manures and fertilizers, with experiments to show their effects. Special instruction is given in the mechanical operations of the farm, and in the practical management of teams. This class is continued throughout the whole session. Class II.âZoology. This class includes the study of the leading principles of the science, with special reference to the anatomy, physiology and morphology of typical species, throughout the animal kingdom. Special lectures are given during this course on insects injurious to vegetation, on fish and oyster culture, and on the breeding, rearing, and diseases of domestic animals. The fine collection of Zoological specimens in the Brooks Museum affords excellent facilities for study in this class. This class is continued until the examination, about the middle of March. Class III.âBotany. This is commenced about the middle of March, and is continued until the end of the session. The time is mainly devoted to the study of flowering plantsâtheir analysis and determination. Cryptogamic Botany, especially fungi and fungoid diseases of plants, receive as much attention as circumstances allow. These classes may be taken separately; and a certificate of proficiency will be conferred for satisfactory attainment in the class of Botany. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. The following Text-Books are used in this school: "How Crops Grow," and "How Crops Feed," by Johnson;" "Scientific Agriculture," by Pendleton; "Manual of Zoology," by Nicholson; "School and Field Book of Botany," by Gray. The following may be usefully referred to in connection with different parts of the course: Carpenter's "Zoology;" Harris' "Insects Injurious to Vegetation;" Mivart's Comparative Anatomy;" "Flora of the Southern States," by Chapman; "How to Farm Profitably," by Mechi; "Armsby on Cattle Feeding," and "Law's Veterinary Adviser." CORCORAN SCHOOL OF NATURAL HISTORY AND GEOLOGY. Prof. W. M. Fontaine, M. A. This school is divided into three classes, viz: Geology, Mineralogy, and Botany.* * For the present, the subject of Botany is transferred to the School of Agriculture, Zoology, and Botany. I. Geology.âThe subject of Geology will be taught during the entire session, and three lectures per week will be devoted to it. The aim of the course of instruction is to give as thorough an exposition of the fundamental principles of the science as possible, and to teach the student how to use them in practical work in the field. Special reference is made to the Geology of America. Text-Books.âThe Professor's Lectures, and Le Conte's Elements of Geology. For reference: Dana's Manual, and Lyell's Elements and Principles of Geology. II. Mineralogy.âThe subject of Mineralogy will be studied until the intermediate examination in February. Two lectures per week will be devoted to it. Special attention will be paid to crystallography, as well as to the chemical and physical properties of minerals. In Descriptive Mineralogy, the mode of occurrence, the geological importance and relations of the species, will be made prominent. Text-Books.âThe Professor's Lectures, and Dana's Manual of Mineralogy and Lithology. For reference: Dana's Text-Book of Mineralogy. The excellent collections of Geological, Mineralogical, and Botanical specimens in the Lewis Brooks Museum of Natural History, afford facilities for the study and illustration of the principles taught. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. Note.âPersons engaged in the study of Geology and Mineralogy, though not members of the University class, can, with the leave of the Professor, and by paying $25 to the Proctor, join the party of the Professor in the prosecution of the field explorations and work during the months of May and June. Note.âThe lectures on Geology and Mineralogy will terminate the last of April, when the Professor will begin Field Explorations and Work with his class, and continue it for two months. Note.âThe hours of lecture will be appointed by the Professor, so as to avoid conflict with other schools. SCHOOL OF PRACTICAL ASTRONOMY. Prof.ââ, (To be elected.) In connection with the Leander McCormick Observatory, liberal friends of the University have endowed a Chair of Practical Astronomy, to be held by the Director of the Observatory. This school will, it is hoped, be open to students in the session of 1882-'83. GRADUATE STUDIES IN THE SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. School of Mathematics.âThe Graduate course in the School of Mathematics will consist of selected studies in the Higher Algebra, Higher Modern Geometry, the Infinitesimal Calculus and some of its applications, or in the elements of quaternions. School of Natural Philosophy.âFor Graduate studies in the School of Natural Philosophy, the student is referred to the paragraph "Practical Physics," page 34. School of General and Industrial Chemistry.âGraduate Course. âThe principal part of this course will consist of practical laboratory work on subjects of original investigation; but advanced reading may also be prescribed, especially in the shape of the bibliography of particular topics, to be looked up from various sources and condensed by the student. SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENT. In the Agricultural Department there is a Graduate Scholarship now in force. The incumbent can select the schools in which he desires to work. The Graduate course in the School of Agriculture, Zoology and Botany consists in a prescribed course of study in Animal and Vegetable Physiology, in Cattle Breeding and Cattle Feeding, and in Rural Economy. Natural History and Geology.âIn this school no fixed course of study will be laid down for Graduates. Subjects will be selected from one or more of the branches included in the school, and assigned to the students. As far as possible, original research will be required in the treatment of the subjects chosen. GRADUATE STUDIES IN LITERARY DEPARTMENT. School of Modern Languages.âGentlemen who desire to continue their studies in this Department will be offered a two-fold course, viz. 1. A course of Lectures on Linguistique, for which a certain amount of knowledge in the Ancient and (at least) two Modern Languages will be required. Such works as Hovelacque's, Diez, Sayce, and the like, will be used as text-books, and constant reference will be made to older forms of living tongues, as well as to trustworthy extracts from ancient works. 2. A course on any one or two modern languages, either for the purpose of thoroughly studying one idiom from the oldest to its present form, with illustrations from its literature through its whole life-time; or for the purpose of comparing a class of idioms, like the members of the Romance or the Slavic families, with each other or with other families, according to their lexical, grammatical, or psychological nature. School of Moral Philosophy.âStudents taking a Graduate course will study the history of philosophy, ancient and modern, and such special systems as the Professor may select; also the history of economic legislation, and sociology. School of History, Literature, and Rhetoric.âThe Graduate course in this school, for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, will be varied from year to year, but will always be designed to train the LITERARY DEPARTMENT. student in original research and systematic exposition of the results. Some historical period, with the contemporaneous intellectual condition, or some definite period of the English Language, with the accompanying social, political, and literary development of the people, will be made the subject of study. Such instructions and directions as may be required to render these pursuits efficacious will be given throughout the session. Graduate Course in Greek.âThis course is designed for advanced students that are making a special and exclusive professional study of Greek Philology. Such students are required to spend two hours each week with the Professor in critical reading and discussion of Greek authors. Extensive courses of Greek reading, both for these hours and for private study, are marked out at the beginning of each session, varying from year to year. Selected text-books, in English, German, or French, on the Political and Literary History of the Greeks, and on the Grammar and Historical Grammar of the Greek language, are assigned for private study. Incessant practice in Greek composition is given. Two theses, one in English and one in Latin, on subjects connected with the language or the history of the Greeks, and demanding independent research, are required as evidence of power to do original work. The accuracy and extent of the student's knowledge of the subjects studied are tested by examinations. THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. JAMES L. CABELL, M. D., M. A., LL. D., Professor of Comparative Anatomy, Physiology, and Surgery. Text-Books.âDalton's Physiology; Wilson's Manual of Hygiene and Sanitary Science, 4th ed., 1880; Ashurst's Surgery. For reference: Flint's Text-Book of Physiology, Stephen Smith's Operative Surgery, Ranney on Surgical Diagnosis (2d ed.), Green's Pathology. JOHN STAIGE DAVIS, M. D., M. A, Professor of Anatomy and Materia Medica. Text-Books.âWilson or Gray's Anatomy, and Farquharson's Materia Medica. JAMES F. HARRISON, M. D., Professor of Medical Jurisprudence, Obstetrics, and Practice of Medicine. Text-Books.âTaylor's Medical Jurisprudence (last edition), Playfair's with Roberts' Midwifery (last edition), Roberts' Practice of Medicine (last edition), Hartshorne's Essentials. J. W. MALLET, Ph. D., M. D., F. R. S., Professor of Chemistry and Pharmacy. Text-Books.âFowne's Chemistry and Parrish's Pharmacy. WILLIAM B. TOWLES, M. D., Demonstrator of Anatomy. The Medical Department of the University aims at thorough work in its special province, to wit: the instruction of the student in the principles of medicine, and his discipline in the modes of acquiring and applying knowledge. Thus, whilst the only solid foundation of professional attainments is laid, the mental faculties are expanded and strengthened for that growth in knowledge, usefulness and distinction to which every one who enlists in an honorable and responsible profession should aspire The organization and arrangements by which these aims are successfully accomplished may be briefly stated: MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. ARRANGEMENT OF STUDIES. The length of the session (nine months) renders it convenient and eligible to distribute the subjects of instruction among a smaller number of Professors than in the other medical schools of the United States, whose sessions are only four or five months long. Thus, to one Professor is assigned Physiology and Surgery; to another, Human Anatomy and Materia Medica; to a third, Chemistry and Pharmacy; and to a fourth, Medical Jurisprudence, Obstetrics, and the Practice of Medicine. This distribution makes it practicable to bring the different subjects to the attention of the student in their natural and successive order. The arrangement of the lectures is such that he acquires a competent knowledge of Anatomy, Physiology and Chemistry before he enters upon the study of the principles and practice of Medicine and Surgery, which can only be studied properly in the light shed upon them by the former. The instructions in Materia Medica and Pharmacy are also given in due relation to the progress of the student in chemistry. LECTURES AND DAILY EXAMINATIONS. Favored as the student is in the comprehensiveness, scientific basis and order of his studies, he is not less favored by arrangements which give ample time for the preparation of every lecture, and address motives to him for such preparation. Each professor gives three regular lectures a week, with occasional extra lectures, making the average weekly aggregate not over fourteen, or a little more than two a day. The student, therefore, is not over-burdened with lecture-room attendance. He has time for study in his private room, to consult books, and compare their teachings with the oral instructions of his Professor, and to digest and systematise his acquisitions from both sources. The daily examinations which precede every lecture supply the stimulus to regular and active study, serve as summary reviews of what he has already heard or read, and as correctives of any misconceptions he may have fallen into in his hearing or reading. The daily examinations constitute a very valuable part of the exercises of the Institution, and are taken into account in determining the fitness of a student for graduation. APPARATUS AND ILLUSTRATIONS. The equipment of the Medical Department in apparatus, specimens and drawings, is extensive and excellent. The collection of paintings MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. for the illustration of the lectures on Anatomy, Physiology and Surgery, several hundred in number, is unequalled by anything of the kind in the United States, or perhaps abroad. PRACTICAL ANATOMY AND DISSECTION. The Department furnishes every facility for the study of practical Anatomy that can be furnished in similar institutions elsewhere. Adequate provision is made for the supply of subjects, and each student has the opportunity, by actual dissection under the guidance of a Demonstrator of Anatomy, of acquiring a practical knowledge of the structure of the human body in all its parts. DEGREES. The degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred upon such students as prove their fitness for the same by rigid and searching examination. It has ever been the policy of the Institution to make its honors testimonials of merit, and not certificates of attendance on a prescribed course of instruction. LABORATORY COURSES FOR MEDICAL STUDENTS. In addition to the usual course of Medical Lectures, two special courses of instruction will be given by the Professor of Analytical Chemistry to such Medical Students as may desire to pursue them: 1st, Sixteen lessons in the practical applications of Chemistry to Medicine, (the detection of poisons, chemical and microsopic examination of animal products, urine, blood, etc.) 2nd, Fourteen lessons in practical pharmaceutical manipulations. Each of the above (optional) courses will be at a charge of $20 tuition fee, and $5 for laboratory material consumed. LAW DEPARTMENT. JOHN B. MINOR, LL. D., Professor of Common and Statute Law. STEPHEN O. SOUTHALL, LL. D., Professor of Civil, International, and Constitutional Law, and Equity. This Department is organized with a view to acquaint the student FAMILIARY AND PRACTICALLY with the principles of his profession. The instruction is as thorough as possible, and is given partly through textbooks and partly through lectures, with daily examination upon both. A Moot-Court, in connection with other instruction, tends to perfect the student in the details of practice. Under the immediate supervision of the professors, he is required to pronounce opinions upon supposed cases; to devise and institute remedies by suit or otherwise; to conduct suits at law and in equity from their inception, through all their stages; to draw wills, conveyances, and other assurances; and in short, to perform most of the functions of a practising lawyer. The Department comprises two schools, each of which is divided into two classes, and the course of study is as follows: SCHOOL OF COMMON AND STATUTE LAW. Prof. John B. Minor, LL. D. Junior Class.âBlackstone's Commentaries. Minor's Institutes of Common and Statute Law, namely: Vol. I, The Rights which Relate to the Person. Vol. II, The Rights which Relate to Real Property. Minor's Synopsis of Criminal Law. Senior Class.âStephen on Pleading. Minor's Institutes of Common and Statute Law, namely: Vol. IV, The Practice of the Law in Civil Cases, including Pleading. Vol. III, The Rights which Relate to Personal Property. ? For reference, Virginia Code, (1873); Revised Statutes of United States. LAW DEPARTMENT. SCHOOL OF EQUITY, MERCANTILE AND INTERNATIONAL, CONSTITUTIONAL AND CIVIL LAW, AND GOVERNMENT. Prof. S. O. Southall, LL. D. Junior Class.âVattel's International Law, with lectures, Lectures on Government, Federalist. Senior Class.âSmith's Mercantile Law; Greenleaf's Evidence; Adams' Equity, with Lectures. For reference, Stephen's Digest of the Law of Evidence. In the Department of Law, the degree of Bachelor of Law is conferred upon those who, upon examination conducted in writing, manifest an intimate acquaintance with the subjects taught in ALL THE CLASSES; and to those who, upon like examination, exhibit a competent knowledge of International and Constitutional Law, and of the Science of Government, a Certificate of Proficiency is awarded. In order to obtain the degree, the whole of the foregoing course must be completed HERE, no preliminary examination being had upon entering. The course is designed for two sessions, and in general it is not prudent to devote less to it; the future professional success of the student depending much upon his full mastery of it. It is a maxim sanctioned by long and wide experience, that "he who is not a good lawyer when he comes to the bar, will seldom be a good one afterwards." And in order to such thorough acquaintance with the elements of the law, thought is requisite as well as reading; and for the purpose of thought, there must be TIME to digest, as well as INDUSTRY to acquire. One cannot expect to gorge himself with law, as a boa constrictor does with masses of food, and then digest it afterwards; the process of assimilation must go on, if it is to proceed healthfully and beneficially, at the same time with the reception of the knowledge. So the athlete judges, who wishes to train the physical man to the most vigorous development, and the intellectual athlete cannot do better than imitate the example. But whilst the student is advised, as a general rule, to avoid the attempt to complete the course in a single session, yet, if he chooses to essay it (as some do successfully), he is admitted to stand the graduating examinations, and if he attains the standard required, he is entitled to his degree. The expenses of a Law student, as appears from page 61 of this Catalogue, amount to about $312 to $339 for a session of nine months, commencing 1st October; or in the boarding club to about $287.50 per session. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING. FRANCIS H. SMITH, M. A., Professor of Natural Philosophy. CHARLES S. VENABLE, LL. D., Professor of Mathematics. JOHN W. MALLET, Ph. D., M. D., LL. D., F. R. S., Professor of General and Applied Chemistry. WM. M. FONTAINE, M. A., Professor of Natural History and Geology. FRANCIS P. DUNNINGTON, B. Sc., Adjunct Professor of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry. WILLIAM M. THORNTON, Adjunct Professor of Mathematics Applied to Engineering. JOSHUA W. GORE, C. E., Instructor in Mathematics. This department is designed to furnish intending engineers thorough and practical instruction in the principles of Engineering and the sciences connected therewith. For this purpose, in addition to the schools of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Mineralogy, and Geology, already existing in the University, there have been organized (since 1867) the schools of Analytical Chemistry and of Mathematics applied to Engineering. For the first four schools the courses of instruction are given in detail in the Scientific Department. SCHOOL OF ANALYTICAL AND AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY. Prof. Mallet. Adjunct Prof. Dunnington. The course of instruction in this school is given in detail on page 37. Among the subjects taught in it, the following are of special importance to the engineer: Blowpipe analysis; Determination of Minerals by means of simple tests, which also lend aid in deciding as to the durability of rocks; Estimation of the value of Ores by means of ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT. "fire assays" and "wet assays;" Testing of building stones, fire clays, etc. There is also special benefit to be derived from the training in accuracy and in delicate manipulation, and from a familiarity with the chemical and physical properties of metals and other materials, with so many of which the engineer constantly has to deal. SCHOOL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS. Prof. Thornton. I. CIVIL ENGINEERING. JUNIOR CLASS. Introduction.*âThe principles and practice of orthogonal, oblique, axonometric, and perspective projections, with applications to the construction of Shades and Shadows.

Hydraulic Engineering.âRiver Engineering, Storage of Water, Distribution of Water, Drainage and Sewerage of Cities, and Agricultural Hydraulics. II. MINING ENGINEERING. In addition to the subjects marked with (*) in the course of Civil Engineering, the following are required of Mining Engineers: Exploitation of Mines.âAfter an introductory classification of Ore Deposits under the three divisions of Lodes, Beds, and Placers, with special reference to the mineral wealth of the United States, are treated the Prospect, Survey and Location of Mines; the Exploitation of Lodes, Beds, and Placers; the Methods of Underground Transport; the design and construction of Mine Hoists; and the Drainage, Ventilation, and Lighting of Mines. SENIOR CLASS. Mechanics of Machines.âThe construction of crank chains, wheel chains, pulley chains, cam chains, belt chains, and screw chains, with applications to the design of parallel motions, valve gears, link motions, wheel trains, belts and water rods, tackle and presses, teledynamic and hydraulic transmissions, escapements, ratchets, cams, valves, etc., and of reciprocating, oscillating and rotary engines, pumps, and blowers. Theory of Prime Movers.âHydraulic Motors, including Water-Pressure Engines, Water-Wheels, and Turbines; Pumps and Pumping Machinery; Thermodynamics, with applications to the design of Hot-Air Engines, Air Compressors and Blowers, Compressed-Air Engines, Pneumatic Transmissions, and Steam Engines; Steam Generators, including the theory of Fuels, construction of Furnaces, Chimneys, Boilers and their appurtenances, and the design of the Generator; and Steam Engines, simple and compound, stationary and locomotive, with the design of the engine and its appurtenances. Instruction in the foregoing subjects is conveyed by a course of systematic lectures, combined with assiduous practice in the field and at the drawing-board, continued throughout the course. In the lecture course the principles are carefully elucidated, the rules of construction are deduced, and are then applied to the criticism of existing structures and the design of proposed works. In the field course the adjustments and use of the instruments are carefully taught, and the student, after a thorough drill in the methods of measuring and estimating lengths, altitudes, and angles, is required to ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT. execute for himself surveys of lands, buildings, and topography; to locate lines for railways, highways, and canals, and to set out curves, earthworks and masonry. In the course of design the easy and accurate use of pen and brush is first acquired by exercises in projective and topographic drawing. The student is then required, from assigned data, to compute the dimensions of proposed structures, and on the basis of his computations to prepare bills of material, and general and detailed drawings of the works; to draw up specifications and furnish estimates of cost in accordance with prices current. To facilitate the instruction in this department, the University has provided a commodious and well-lighted lecture room and drawing hall; a liberal supply of field instruments, of the best construction; and models and drawings of a large variety of structures, illustrating the best practice of modern engineers, American and foreign. The requisites for degrees in Engineering are given at page 59 of this Catalogue. It is estimated that either course can be completed by a well prepared student in two years; and the following arrangement of studies is recommended, but not compulsory. Adequate preparation is an accurate knowledge of the elements of Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry. The ability to translate from the French and German languages is an inestimable advantage. Course for Degree of C. E. 1. Junior Applied Mathematics, Chemistry, Pure Mathematics. 2. Senior Applied Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Mineralogy, and Geology. Annual expenses, $305 to $359, according to price paid for board. Course for Degree of M. E. 1. Junior Applied Mathematics, Physics, Pure Mathematics, General Chemistry. 2. Senior Applied Mathematics, Industrial Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, Mineralogy and Geology. Annual expenses $370 to $424, according to price paid for board. Virginia students in this department, over eighteen years old, who have passed the requisite entrance examinations, pay no tuition, except in Applied Mathematics and Analytical Chemistry. AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. JOHN R. PAGE, M. D., Professor of Zoology, Botany and Agriculture. FRANCIS H. SMITH, M. A., Professor of Natural Philosophy. JOHN W. MALLET, Ph. D., M. D., LL. D., F. R. S., Professor of General and Applied Chemistry. WM. M. FONTAINE, M. A., Professor of Natural History and Geology. FRANCIS P. DUNNINGTON, B. Sc., Adjunct Professor of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry. WILLIAM M. THORNTON, Adjunct Professor of Mathematics Applied to Engineering. The late Samuel Miller, of Lynchburg, having by deed given in trust one hundred thousand dollars for the establishment of a Department of Scientific and Practical Agriculture at the University of Virginia, the Trustees, under this deed, met the Rector and Visitors of the University on the 17th of September, 1869, and arrangements were made for putting the said department in operation. These arrangements have subsequently, by action taken at various times, been extended and added to; the above-named Professors have been nominated by the trustees of the "Miller Fund," and elected by the Board of Visitors of the University; certain lands belonging to the University have been set aside, and brought into cultivation as an Experimental Farm; a machine for the manufacture of drain tiles has been imported from England, and put in operation; and implements, apparatus, models and specimens of various kinds have been collected as material aids to the course of instruction. In this, as in all the other departments of the University, entire freedom of choice is left to the student as to the schools he shall attend, and the order in which he shall attend them; and this choice will be influenced in individual cases by the nature and extent of previous preparation, as well as by difference of ulterior aim; but a student of average ability, who has already had a fair general education, and who comes to AGRICULTURAL DEPARTMENT. the University with the intention of devoting himself to a study of the principles upon which Agriculture is based, will probably do well to select for the first year Natural Philosophy, (Junior Class,) Chemistry (general), Zoology, Agricultural Botany and Agriculture, and Mineralogy and Geology; and for the second year Scientific and Practical Agriculture, Agricultural and Industrial Chemistry (including the first Laboratory Class of Analytical Chemistry) and Agricultural Engineering. This arrangement of studies may, with advantage, be expanded to a course for three years, or may be varied by the selection of other Schools when deemed desirable. For the method of study in the respective Schools, reference should be made to the preceding pages of this Catalogue. The degree of Bachelor of Scientific Agriculture is conferred in this department.

The examinations are of three kinds: 1, the Daily examinations; 2, the Intermediate and Final general examinations; and 3, the examinations for Graduation. DAILY EXAMINATIONS. Each Professor, before commencing the lectures of the day, examines his class orally on the subject of the preceding lecture, as developed in the text book and expounded in the lecture. GENERAL EXAMINATIONS. Two general examinations of each class are held during the session in the presence of a committee of the Faculty, which every student is required to stand. The first, called the Intermediate examination, is held about the middle of the session, and embraces in its scope the subjects of instruction in the first half of the course. The second, called the Final examination, is held in the closing month of the session, and embraces the subjects treated of in the second half of the course. These examinations are conducted in writing. The questions propounded have each numerical values attached to them. If the answers of the student are valued in the aggregate at not less than three-fourths of the aggregate values assigned to the questions, he is ranked in the FIRST division; if less than three-fourths, and more than one-half, in the SECOND division; if less than one-half and more than one fourth, in the THIRD division; and if less than one-fourth, in the FOURTH division. Certificates of distinction are awarded to those who attain the first division at one or both of these examinations, and their names are published or announced at the closing exercises of the session. The general examinations are sufficiently comprehensive and difficult to render it impossible for the student, without steady diligence, to secure a place in the first division. The results, whatever they may be, are communicated to parents and guardians respectively in the final circular of the session. The standing of the student at the daily and general examinations is taken into account in ascertaining his qualifications for graduation in any of the schools. DEGREES. EXAMINATIONS FOR GRADUATION. The examinations for graduation are held in the last month of the session. They are conducted in each school by the professor thereof, in the presence of two other professors, forming with him the committee of examination for the school. The candidates for graduation are subjected to searching interrogations on the details and niceties as well as on the leading principles of the subject, and they are expected to be accurately versed in all the topics treated of in the lectures and correlative text. These examinations are chiefly carried on in writing; but in some of the schools they are partly oral. As a proper acquaintance with the English language is indispensable to the attainment of any of the honors of the Institution, all candidates for graduation are required to exhibit in their examination due qualifications in this respect. DEGREES. The degrees conferred by the University are Academic and Professional. The Academic Degrees are: 1. Proficient â conferred for satisfactory attainments in certain subjects of study, to-wit: In Anglo Saxon, the Junior and Intermediate Course of Mathematics, Geology, Mineralogy, Botany, Physics, Physiology, Medical Jurisprudence, Human Anatomy, Political Economy, History, Literature, International Law and Government, Pharmacy, and Agricultural Chemistry. 5. Graduate in a School â conferred for satisfactory attainments in the leading subjects of instruction in the same, to-wit: In the Latin Language and Literature, in the Greek Language and Literature, In the French, German, Spanish, or Italian Language and Literature, Mixed Mathematics, Pure Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Practical Physics, Moral Philosophy, History, Literature, and Rhetoric, Applied Mathematics, Analytical Chemistry, General Chemistry, Industrial Chemistry, Zoology, Agricultural Botany and Agriculture, and Natural History, and Geology. 3. Bachelor of Artsâconferred on such candidates as haveâ 1st, Attained distinction on the whole course taught in the Intermediate Class, (or its equivalent, as fixed by the Faculty, where no Intermediate Class exists), in the Schools of Pure Mathematics, of Latin, of Greek, of Natural Philosophy, and of Moral Philosophy; 2nd, Graduated in any two of the Academic Schools; and 3rd, Presented an essay, DEGREES. or treatise, composed by themselves, and accepted as satisfactory by the Faculty, on some subject of science, philosophy, history or literature. 4. Doctor of Philosophy â granted to students who shall have graduated, and obtained Post-Graduate distinction in the studies contained in any one of the five following classes, (after having received the degree of Bachelor of Arts, as a previous condition): Class I. to containâMathematics and Mathematical Physics. Class II. to containâLatin and Greek. Class III. to containâMoral Philosophy, Political Economy, and History and Literature. Class IV. to containâModern Languages, (including Anglo-Saxon,) History and Literature. Class V. to containâExperimental Physics, Chemistry, and Natural History and Geology. It will be perceived that the above scheme leaves unchanged the present degrees of Proficients and Graduates in single schools, and also the present degree of Master of Arts. 5. Master of Arts of the University of Virginia, conferred upon students who have graduated in the Latin, Greek, French and German Languages, Pure Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, General Chemistry, Moral Philosophy, and History, Literature and Rhetoric, and who have been subjected in the last year of their candidacy to a special examination, in any two schools of their own selection, in which they may have graduated in a previous year. The candidate for the degree of Bachelor or Master of Arts is also required to submit for the approval of the Faculty an essay, composed by himself, on some subject of literature or science, which essay must be read by the author on the Public Day, if so ordered. By a recent order of the Board of Visitors, graduation in the School of Natural History and Geology is admitted as a substitute for graduation in History and Literature, or in Natural Philosophy, or in Moral Philosophy; and the attainment of the degree of Bachelor of Arts, as at present organized, is made necessary to the degree of Master of Arts. The Professional Degrees are: 1. Bachelor of Lawâconferred for satisfactory attainments in all the subjects of instruction in the Schools of Law. 2. Doctor of Medicineâconferred for satisfactory attainments in all the subjects of instruction in the several schools constituting the Medical Department. DEGREES. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine who have been previously declared graduates in General Chemistry, or proficients in Anatomy, Physiology, or Medical Jurisprudence, are not required to stand the examinations in these subjects anew; and the same rule applies to candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Law who are proficients in International Law and Government. 3. Civil Engineer â conferred on such students as have graduated in the Schools of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry or Industrial Chemistry, obtained certificates of proficiency in Mathematics and in Geology and Mineralogy, and graduated in the School of Applied Mathematics, course of Civil Engineering, with satisfactory attainments in a prescribed course on the Infinitesimal Calculus. 4. Mining Engineer â conferred on such students as have graduated in the Schools of Chemistry and Industrial Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry, obtained certificates of proficiency in Physics, in Geology, and Mineralogy, and in Mathematics, and graduated in the School of Applied Mathematics, course of Mining Engineering, with satisfactory attainments in a prescribed course on the Infinitesimal Calculus. 5. Bachelor of Scientific Agricultureâconferred on such students as have obtained a certificate of proficiency in the Class of Physics, distinctions in Junior Applied Mathematics, Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry, and diplomas in the Schools of General and Industrial Chemistry, Agriculture, Zoology, Botany, and Natural History and Geology. PUBLIC DAY. On the closing day of the session, which occurs on the Thursday before the 4th day of July, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers and Students of the University assemble in the Public Hall, whither also the friends of the students and the public generally are invited. On this occasion the results of the examinations are announced, and certificates and diplomas awarded. EXPENSES. 1.

Under a late act of the Legislature, students from Virginia over eighteen years of age are, on examination, admitted into the Academic Schools without being required to pay tuition fees therein. The expenses of such students, exclusive of text-books, clothing, and pocket-money, will beâ For those who board, from $232 to $259. For those who mess, $205.00. By authority of the General Assembly, the following regulations have been adopted by the Board of Visitors as to the General and Special Examinations for admission of Virginia students into the University: General Examination. Applicants are required to pass, once for all, to entitle them to matriculation, on their first coming to the University, an examination in the English language and in Arithmetic. In English, they will be required to show both a practical knowledge of the language, as proved by orthography and by correctness in composition, and a theoretical knowledge of the Inflections and Syntax. In Arithmetic, they will be required to know the elementary processes, Vulgar and Decimal Fractions, Proportion, and the metric system of Denominate Numbers. Special Examinations. After passing the General Examination, the Virginia students who desire to study Latin, Greek, Mathematics, or History and Literature, will be required to pass the following Special Examinations for each school: I. For admission to the School of Latinâthe full knowledge of the Inflections of the language will be rigorously demanded; besides this, acquaintance with the elementary principles of Syntax, and ability to translate any passage from Books I and II of CÃ¦sar's Commentaries, or from Cicero's four orations against Catiline. II. For admission to the School of Greekâa full and exact knowledge of the Attic Inflections, especially of the verb, will be rigorously demanded; besides this, acquaintance with the elementary principles of Syntax, and ability to translate any passage from the first two books of Xenophon's Anabasis. III. For admission to the school of Mathematicsâthe knowledge of Algebra, embracing the fundamental operations, simple and quadratic equations, and proportion, and the first three books of Plane Geometry. IV. For admission to the School of History and Literature: For the Class of History âModern Geography, and an Elementary History of Greece, Rome, the United States or England; for the Class of Literatureâan Elementary History of England. For admission to the other Academic Schools, not specified above, only the General Examination will be required. The preparation required for the advanced classes, Iutermediate or Senior, in the several schools, is shown by the courses laid down in the Catalogue. VIRGINIA STUDENTS. The examinations of Academic Students from Virginia, over eighteen years of age, for admission under the late act of the Legislature, will be held on the 26th, 27th, 28th, and 29th of September. All students that intend to apply for examination under the law are urged to report themselves promptly to the Chairman of the Faculty before the beginning of the session, (1st of October.) Those that come later, after the work of the session has begun, will of necessity be subjected to inconvenience and delay. The time of the special examinations will be fixed by the several professors, each for his own school. The Faculty of the University, prompted by their experience of the preliminary examinations of the present session, wish most earnestly to call the attention of the public, and especially of their brother teachers in Virginia, to the importance of accuracy and thoroughness in the elements of education, especially in English orthography and composition, in elementary geography and history, in arithmetic, and in the inflections of the classical languages. Students that are well grounded in these elementary studies can do well from the first, and can advance themselves steadily from class to class; but looseness and inaccuracy of knowledge in these lead only to prolonged and disheartening failure. The stress of the preliminary examinations will, therefore, be laid upon accuracy in elementary knowledge. Note.âIn the schools of Greek and Mathematics, young men are advised to prepare themselves at least for the intermediate classes. LIBRARY, LABORATORIES, MUSEUMS AND OBSERVATORY. LIBRARY. F. W. Page, Librarian. The Library of the University, originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, and since much enlarged by purchases and donations, now contains about 40,000 volumes. LABORATORY OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY. The Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry is large and well-fitted, and capable of accommodating from fifty to seventy-five working students. See page 38, under School of Analytical and Agricultural Chemistry. PHYSICAL LABORATORY. A suitable room has been assigned to this object by the Board of Visitors. The needful fittings have been partly provided, and its thorough equipment will be pushed forward as rapidly as funds for the purpose can be obtained. THE LEWIS BROOKS MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY. The Lewis Brooks Museum contains collections illustrating the subjects of Geology, Mineralogy, Zoology and Botany. Each of the collections is selected so as to exemplify the principles of these sciences, and, at the same time, to exhibit a large variety of objects for study. Its primary object is to serve as an aid in teaching Natural History. In Geology the collections are large and well selected. The specimens of rocks show all the different kinds classified according to mineral character, and the formations in which they occur. The collection of fossils, plaster casts, maps, etc., etc., is exceptionally fine, and fully illustrates Historical Geology. In Mineralogy the principles of the science are made plain by well-chosen suites of specimens, models of crystals, etc., etc. The general collection of minerals contains all the important minerals, and many of the rarer ones, in good specimens. The science of Zoology is well illustrated by a fine and large collection MUSEUMS AND OBSERVATORY. of objects, such as mounted skeletons, stuffed animals, dried specimens, plaster casts, etc., etc. In Botany the collections contain charts, papier-machÃ© models of flowers, fruits, sections of wood, etc., etc. The bulk of the collection is in the form of an herbarium selected from the most important and interesting botanical regions of the world. In addition to the above, a beginning has been made in the formation of a collection to illustrate the geology and mineralogy of the State, and this will be increased as rapidly as possible. MUSEUM OF INDUSTRIAL CHEMISTRY. This Museum contains a very large number of specimens illustrating the products and processes of Chemistry applied to the arts and manufactures, and so arranged as to be a most valuable aid to the student of Industrial Chemistry. (See School of General and Applied Chemistry, p. 36.) LEANDER McCORMICK ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATORY. This Observatory, which is now in the process of building on the University grounds, the institution owes to the munificence of Leander J. McCormick, Esq., of Chicago. It will contain the great refracting telescope of 26Â½ inches aperture, constructed for Mr. McCormick by Alvan Clark &amp; Sons, and given by him to the University. When completed, the Observatory will be fitted with the working apparatus of the best modern observatories. The directorship has been endowed with the sum of $50,000 by friends of the University; and an additional sum of $25,000 given to the institution by Wm. H. Vanderbilt, Esq., of New York, has been invested, that the income may form a working fund for the Observatory. (See School of Practical Astronomy, page 41.)</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Literary Societies, Young Men's Christian Association, and Friends of Temperance. LITERARY SOCIETIES. There are two Literary Societies (the "Washington Society" and the "Jefferson Society") of long standing, connected with the University. They meet weekly in their respective halls for the purpose of cultivating debate and composition, and hold public exhibitions at intervals during the session, and at its close. Each Society bestows medals on its best debaters, and the two Societies in conjunction give a medal to the best writer in the Students' Magazine, maintained by them. YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION. This society seeks to bring new students under good influences, and furnishes opportunities for Christian work in the University and its neighborhood. It has been in active operation many years. It has established and maintains the STUDENTS' UNIVERSITY READING ROOM. This is convenient of access, comfortably arranged and furnished, and supplied with a large selection of the best periodical literature. It is open to all members of the University upon the payment of a fee to meet its current expenses. FRIENDS OF TEMPERANCE. The Friends of Temperance are represented by University Council No. 46, an association which has done good service in guarding young men against dangerous excesses, and in promoting literary and moral culture. This Council bestows annually a scholarship in the University on one of its deserving members. GYMNASIUM. A society, organized among the students for the promotion of physical culture, under the name of the "Squibb Gymnasium Association," has been in successful operation during several sessions. THE RIVES BOAT CLUB Was founded upon a liberal gift from F. R. Rives, Esq., of New York.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Scholarships. I. UNIVERSITY SCHOLARSHIPS. Eleven Scholarships, entitling the successful candidates at a competitive examination to prosecute the studies of one session at the University of Virginia without the payment of matriculation fees or tuition fees, are open to new-comers from all the states at the beginning of the academic year (October 1st). Of these eleven scholarships five are in the Academic Department, and two severally in the departments of Law; of Medicine; and of Industrial Chemistry, Civil and Mining Engineering and Agriculture. The examination is uniform, and embraces Latin, Greek, Mathematics, and English. In order to secure positive attainments the right is reserved to reject any papers that do not reach the standard required for distinction at the Final Examination in Junior Latin, Junior Greek, and Junior Mathematics, and do not show a competent acquaintance with the grammatical and rhetorical structure of the English language. The subjects of examination in Latin, Greek and Mathematics for these scholarships will be found under the head "Junior Class" of those Schools. For more precise information the applicant will apply to the Professors. II. MILLER AGRICULTURAL SCHOLARSHIPS. There are three scholarships in the Agricultural Department, named for Samuel Miller, Esq., the founder of the department. These scholarships are worth $333.33 each, and are bestowed on competitive examination. For information as to subjects of examination, apply to the Professors in the Department. III. TEMPERANCE SCHOLARSHIP. The Friends of Temperance (University Council) bestow a scholarship annually on some worthy student-member of their Council. IV. ALUMNI SCHOLARSHIPS. There are some scholarships founded by individuals, the appointments to which rest with the founders, or with the Executive Committee of the Society of the Alumni.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Regulations. LATE ENTRANCE AND WITHDRAWAL. No abatement is made in the matriculation, tuition fees and room rent, on account of late entrance, unless the student enter after the first of January, and no portion of the same is refunded on account of withdrawal from the University before the close of the session, unless the withdrawal be rendered necessary by ill health, and occur before the first of March. The charges for board, fuel, lights, and washing, are estimated from the time of entrance. Many disadvantages to the student result from late entrance; therefore, prompt attendance at the beginning of the session is earnestly enjoined upon all who wish to derive the full benefits of the course of instruction. RULES WITH REGARD TO RENTAL OF ROOMS IN THE UNIVERSITY BUILDINGS. To secure rooms in the University Buildings, application may be made by letter to the Proctor; but if the rent is not deposited with him before the 15th of September, the room is considered to be unengaged. PROHIBITION OF CREDIT. An act of the legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students. The license to contract debts, which the chairman is authorized to grant, is confined (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing,) to cases of urgent necessity; and these, it is hoped, parents and guardians will, as far as possible, prevent from arising by the timely supply of the requisite funds. PRIVILEGED STUDENTS. Ministers of the Gospel may attend any of the schools of the University without the payment of tuition fees. The same privilege will be extended to any young man preparing for the ministry, on condition that he submit testimonials that he is a bona fide candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. USE OF LIBRARY. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the librarian is present in the library for four hours daily, to attend to their wants. Persons at a distance, who may desire to consult this library by correspondence, can do so on payment of a small charge, proportioned to the time and labor expended on the research required, copying of titles, or passages from authors, etc. A letter on this subject, prepaid, and addressed to Frederick W. Page, Esq., Librarian, will receive attention. INFIRMARY. There is a well-appointed infirmary connected with the University for the care and comfort of sick students. Every student on matriculation deposits the infirmary fee, DONATIONS. $7.50,) which entitles him, in case of sickness during the session, to the advice and attendance of the infirmary physicians, (the Professors in the Medical Department,) and, if necessary, to nursing by professional nurses, without additional charge. DISCIPLINE AND RELIGIOUS WORSHIP. Morality and Religion are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline of the University is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity, and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with religious influences; but experience has proved that the best way to effect this result is to forbear the employment of coercion; the attendance on religious exercises is therefore entirely voluntary. Prayers are held every morning in the chapel, and divine service is conducted twice on Sunday by a chaplain, selected in turn from the principal religious denominations. The chaplain for the present session is the Rev. J. T. Whitley. MONTHLY CIRCULAR. At the end of every month a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from lectures and examinations, and any other irregularities of which he may have been guilty, together with such further information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate, or as the parent or guardian may specially request. The object of such reports being, on the one hand, to incite the student to steady diligence, by eliciting the commendation and encouragement of his friends, and, on the other, to restrain him from idleness and disorder, or to urge him to amendment by their admonition and advice, their usefulness greatly depends upon the prompt and judicious attention they receive from those to whom they are addressed. Parents and guardians, therefore, cannot be too earnest in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly reports may suggest. DONATIONS TO THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. Under an act of the Legislature, entitled "A bill to encourage donations to the University of Virginia, and to constitute the State of Virginia the trustee thereof," "any person may deposit in the treasury of this State, or bequeath money, stock, or public bonds of any kind, to be so deposited, or grant, devise, or bequeath property real or personal, to be sold, and the proceeds to be so deposited, in sums not less than one hundred dollars, which shall be invested in certificates of debt of the State of Virginia, or of the United States, or any other State thereof, for the benefit of the University of Virginia; and in such case the interest or dividend accruing on such stock, certificates of debt or bonds, shall be paid to the Rector and Visitors of the University, to be by them appropriated to the general purposes thereof, unless some particular appropriation shall have been designated by the donor or testator as hereinafter provided.âThe State of Virginia is hereby constituted the trustee for the safekeeping and due application of all funds which may be deposited in the treasury in pursuance of this act." The legal title of the University isâ "The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia." DONATIONS. ENDOWMENT OF PROFESSORSHIPS AND SCHOLARSHIPS THROUGH THE SOCIETY OF ALUMNI. Under an act of the Legislature, entitled "A bill to incorporate the Society of Alumni of the University of Virginia," this Society is authorized, by the executive Committee, or in such other way as it may direct, "to raise the sum of five hundred thousand dollars, to be held in the name of the `Society of Alumni of the University of Virginia,' to be safely invested, and the net annual income therefrom to be applied to the benefit of the University of Virginia." It is also empowered "to employ agents to obtain endowments for scholarships and professorships, to solicit donations, to dispose of anything of value belonging to the Society, or entrusted to its management for the purpose of endowing professorships or scholarships, or for accomplishing any of the other objects of the Society authorized by its charter." SUMMER COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. There are courses of instruction given during the vacation in the following subjects, viz: Common and Statute Law, by Professor J. B. Minor, LL. D; Pure and Applied Mathematics, by Adjunct-Professor Wm. M. Thornton; Theoretical and Practical Chemistry, by Professor J. W. Mallet. These courses form no part of the University Department, but are the private enterprises of the Professors who undertake them, to whom application should be made by those seeking fuller information concerning them.</field>
