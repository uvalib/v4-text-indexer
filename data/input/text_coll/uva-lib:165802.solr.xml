      <field name="fulltext">CATALOGUE. STATEMENT OF THE TERMS OF ADMISSION, Courses of Instruction, Expenses, &amp;c., OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. MATRICULATION. To be admitted as a student of the University, the applicant must be at least sixteen years of age; but the Faculty may dispense with this requirement, in favor of one who has a brother, of the requisite age, entering at the same time. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he must produce a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence of general good conduct. There is no prescribed course of studies in this institution. Every student may select the schools he will attend: but, in the academic department, he is required to attend at least three, unless, upon the written request of his parent or guardian, or for good cause shown, the Faculty shall allow him to attend less than three. Students are permitted to exchange schools, with transfer of fees, within one week after admission: thereafter, no exchange is allowed, except by leave of the Faculty, and then, without transfer of fees. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. COURSE OF INSTRUCTION. The session commences on the first of October, and continues, without interruption, until the 29th of June ensuing. The mode of instruction is by lectures and text-books, accompanied by daily examinations. In each school there are, at least, three regular lectures a week; but in most of the schools there are more than three, according to the subjects into which the school is divided. Literary and Scientific Schools: ANCIENT LANGUAGES. PROFESSOR GILDERSLEEVE. I.—LATIN. The subjects taught in this school are: 1. The Latin language. 2. Roman literature. 3. History of Rome. The method of instruction comprises lectures, (systematic and exegetical,) examinations, written and oral exercises. The school is divided into two classes, Junior and Senior. The authors read in the Senior Class, are principally: Cicero, Horace, Livy, Juvenal and Tacitus; in the Junior Class, Terence, Sallust, Virgil and Ovid. A private course of parallel and preparatory reading is also prescribed for each class. Works of reference: For the lectures on the structure and syntax of the language, Zumpt's Grammar, Dr. Harrison's Exposition. For the lectures on the History of Rome, (Senior Class,) Liddell's Rome. The written and oral exercises constitute a prominent feature in the plan of instruction. CATALOGUE. II.—GREEK. The subjects taught in this school are: 1. The Greek language. 2. Greek literature. 3. History of Greece. The method of instruction is identical with the plan of the school of Latin. The classic authors read in the Senior Class, are principally: Thucydides, Sophocles, Euripides and Plato; in the Junior Class, Lysias, Xenophon, Herodotus, Homer and Demosthenes. A private course of parallel and preparatory reading is also prescribed for each class. Works of reference.—For the lectures on the structure and syntax of the language, Hadley's Greek Grammar, Kühner's School Grammar. For the lectures on the History of Greece (Senior Class,) Thirlwall's and Grote's History of Greece. III.—MODERN LANGUAGES. PROFESSOR SCHELE DE VERE. The subjects taught in this school are: 1. The French, Italian, Spanish and German languages. 2. The literature of these languages, and the history of each idiom, embracing the general principles of the formation and growth of languages, and of Comparative Grammar and Philology. 3. The Anglo-Saxon language, and, in connexion with it, the History and Laws of the English language. Graduation in French and German will hereafter be required for the degree of A. M. IV.—MATHEMATICS. PROFESSOR VENABLE. In this school there are four classes: In the first, or Junior Class, the subjects of study are the General Properties of Numbers and theory of Notation, Algebra Geometry and Plane Trigonometry. Though Algebra and UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. Geometry are commenced in this class, it is very desirable that those who enter it should not only be thoroughly acquainted with Arithmetic, but should also have previously pursued the study of Algebra through equations of the second degree, and of Geometry through the first four books. In the second, or Intermediate Class, the subjects of study are Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, with applications to Surveying, Navigation, and Nautical Astronomy, Descriptive Geometry, with its applications to Spherical Projections, Shades, Shadows, and Perspective and Analytical Geometry. In the third, or Senior Class, the subjects of study are Analytical Geometry of three Dimensions, and the Differential and Integral Calculus. Lectures are given to this class on the History and Philosophy of Mathematics. There is also a fourth class, that of Mixed Mathematics, designed for the benefit of such of the more advanced students as may desire to prosecute their studies beyond the limits of Pure Mathematics. The course embraces the mathematical investigation of the general laws of equilibrium and motion, both of solids and fluids, with a variety of applications, especially to Physical Astronomy. The instruction in each class is conveyed partly by lectures, and partly by the systematic study of approved text-books, the student being assisted by full and frequent explanations from the Professor, and being constantly subjected to rigid examinations. The progress of the student in every class is also tested by his being required to perform written exercises, in which the principles acquired are applied to the solution of particular problems. The text-books used are: For the Junior Class, Davies' Bourdon's Algebra, Legendre's Geometry and Trigonometry. For the Intermediate Class, Pierce's Trigonometry, Davies' Surveying, Descriptive Geometry and Analytical Geometry. For the Senior Class, Courtenay's Differential and Integral Calculus. For the Class of Mixed Mathematics, Pratt's Mechanical Philosophy. Any student entering the school has the privilege of attending all or any of the classes, as he may select, and if prepared to enter an advanced class, may often find it highly advantageous to review his previous studies by attendance on a lower class also. CATALOGUE. V.—NATURAL PHILOSOPHY. PROFESSOR SMITH. This school embraces three classes. Instruction is given in each class by lectures and the study of text-books, accompanied by daily examinations. 1. The Junior Class meets three times each week. The object of the course of lectures to this class is to furnish the student with a comprehensive view of Modern Physics, and to make him familiar with its methods of investigation. With the design of laying a thoroughly scientific basis for the course, a large space is given, at the outset, to the discussion of the cardinal doctrines of motion and force. These doctrines are established, and their leading consequences traced without the use of technical or mathematical language. Their application to the equilibrium and motion of solids and fluids is fully presented. Under these heads a great variety of topics is introduced, embracing, among others, the Centre of Gravity, Theory of Machinery, Friction, Pendulum and its uses, Figure of the Earth, Mean density of the Earth, Laws of Gravitation, Construction and uses of Barometer, Construction and action of Hydraulic, Pneumatic and Hydro-Pneumatic Engines, &amp;c. The subject of Molecular Physics, for which the student is now prepared, is next taken up, and occupies the remainder of the session. The structure of matter, and the laws of molecular actions are considered in the light of experiment, and the atomic hypotheses of Newton, Boscovich, Mossotti and others are examined. The effects of the intermolecular forces are investigated, as they present themselves in capillary phenomena and in the osmose of liquids and gases. Their dynamical action in the phenom of wave motion, both superficial and internal, is traced, Newton's rule for the wave velocity established, and the exceptions explained. The Lectures then proceed to the subject of sound, including its origin, mode of propagation, velocity in different media, reflection, refraction and interference, and the theory and sources of musical sounds. To this succeeds an extended discussion of Light, both common and polarized; embracing the propagation, reflection, single and double refraction, and interference of each kind of Light, and a full examination UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. of the various theories of Light. The subject of Heat is then considered, commencing with Radiant Heat, its velocity, reflection, refraction, transmission and polarization: passing on to the physical effects of Heat, in Expansion, Liquefaction and Vaporization, and including Thermometry and Calorimetry. In this connection, the theory and action of the Steam Engine are presented. Throughout this discussion, constant reference is had to the modern Mechanical theory of Heat. The course of Lectures terminates with the subject of Electricity, Franklinian and Voltaic, connected with Magnetism, Dia-Magnetism, Electro-Magnetism and Magneto-Electricity. Throughout the course, the applications of the science to Meteorology, Geology and Astronomy are noticed as they arise. Reference is made in this class to Rogers' Mechanical Philosophy, Lardner's Hand-books, and Silliman's Philosophy. 2. The Senior Class meets twice a week. Here certain portions of the Junior course are more minutely discussed by the aid of the lower Mathematics. This class studies, in addition, the subject of Astronomy. Text-Books in Astronomy.—Treatises of Herschel, Norton and Loomis. MINERALOGY AND GEOLOGY. 3. These subjects are assigned to a separate class, which the members of the other classes in the school may attend at their option. In this class the lectures commence with general Mineralogy, which is treated with especial reference to Geology, to which it is designed to be an introduction. In the lectures on Geology, the specific identity of ancient and modern Geological causes is pointed out, the present action of these causes, whether atmospheric, aqueous or igneous, considered, and their effects in the past history of our planet examined. The illustrations are drawn, as far as practicable, from the Geological structure of Virginia. The students have an opportunity of familiarizing themselves with the minerals, rocks and fossils exhibited in the lectures. Text-Books.—Dana's Manuals of Mineralogy and Geology. CATALOGUE. VI.—CHEMISTRY. PROFESSOR MAUPIN. The course of lectures in this school commences with an exposition of the phenomena and laws of Heat, Light and Electricity, to the extent rendered necessary by their relations to Chemistry. The subject of Inorganic Chemistry is then taken up. The nomenclature, chemical symbols and notation are explained, and the history of the non-metalic elements and their combinations with each other very fully presented. Then follows a discussion of the general principles of Chemical Philosophy, including the Laws of Combination, the Atomic Theory and Theory of Volumes, and Simple and Current Affinity. The consideration of the Metals comes next in order. After preliminary notices of their general properties, they are taken up individually and very fully considered, together with their compounds with the non-metalic elements, and their saline combinations. The concluding part of the course is devoted to organic Chemistry, embracing the consideration of organic Analysis; the Neutral Principles and their transformations by the action of ferments and other agencies; the Doctrine of Compound Radicals; the various series in which such radicals have been traced; the Vegetable Acids; the Alkaloids, &amp;c. The processes for detecting Poisons, and the means of counteracting their effects are presented in their proper connections; and throughout the course the applications of the facts and principles of the science to Medicine, Agriculture and the Arts, are duly noticed. Books recommended.—Fownes' Chemistry, as a text-book; Graham's Elements; Regnault's Elements, and Abel &amp; Bloxam's Hand-book of Chemistry for reference. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. VII.—SCHOOL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING. PROFESSORS VENABLE, SMITH AND MAUPIN. The course of instruction in this school will, in general, occupy the attention of the student for two sessions. The studies of the first session are those pursued in the schools of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Mineralogy and Geology, and Chemistry; together with lessons in Geometrical Drawing. Students who desire to accomplish the full course of Engineering, in two sessions, should come prepared to enter the Intermediate and Senior classes in the school of Mathematics. The studies pursued during the second session are: 1. With the Professor of Mathematics and the Teacher of Drawing: Higher Geodesy, Spherical Astronomy, Levelling, Roads and Railways, Theory and Use of Instruments, Geometrical Drawing, Applications of Descriptive Geometry to Shades, Shadows, and Perspective, Stone cutting; Field Practice. 2. With the Professor of Natural Philosophy: Strength of Materials, Resistances, Structures in Wood, Iron and Stone; Machinery, Hydraulic Engineering, Steam Engine, Meteorology and use of Meteorological Instruments. 3. With the Professor of Chemistry: Metallurgy, Metallurgical Implements, Structures and Processes; Assay of Ores and Alloys; Details of the Smelting of Iron, Copper, Lead, Zinc, &amp;c. Since many of the standard works to which the student of Engineering will be referred are in French, it is desirable that he should have a sufficient knowledge of that language to enable him to read them with facility. VIII.—MORAL PHILOSOPHY. PROFESSOR McGUFFEY. There are two classes in this school: I. The class in Mental Philosophy. II. The class in Political Economy. Books requisite for the class in Mental Philosophy: 1. Hamilton's Lectures on Metaphysics. 2. Hamilton's Lectures on Logic. CATALOGUE. 3. Cousin's True, Beautiful and Good. 4. Stewart's Active and Moral Powers. 5. Jouffroy's Ethics. 6. Alexander's Moral Science. 7. Butler's Analogy and Sermons. Books required on Political Economy: Say's Political Economy. J. S. Mill's Political Economy, latest edition. Four lectures each week are given to the class in Mental Philosophy, and two lectures each week to the class on Political Economy. HISTORY AND GENERAL LITERATURE. PROFESSOR HOLMES. This school is divided into two distinct classes—one of History, and one of Literature. Either study may be pursued separately. A diploma is granted for proficiency in both branches: a certificate for proficiency in one. HISTORY. In the Historical class the successions, revolutions and aspects of the principal nations of the world are considered in such a manner as to afford a general view of the evolution of civilization. In the absence of appropriate text-books, the following are used: Schmitz' Manual of Ancient History, Smith's History of Greece, Gibbon abridged by Smith, Taylor's Manual of Modern History. LITERATURE. In the class of General Literature, attention is confined to the study of the English language and Literature. Suitable text-books are unattainable in this department. The following are employed: Spalding's History of English Literature, Shaw's Outlines of General Literature; Shakespeare's Complete Works; Aiken's British Poets. Additions to the course will be made as opportunity offers. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. Medical Department. Medical faculty. H. HOWARD, M. D., Professor of Medical Jurisprudence, Obstetrics and Practice of Medicine. Text-books.—Taylor's Medical Jurisprudence, Meigs' Obstetrics and Wood's Practice. J. L. CABELL, M. D., Professor of Comparative Anatomy, Physiology and Surgery. Text-books.—Dalton's Physiology and Druitt's Modern Surgery. J. S. DAVIS, M. D., Professor of Anatomy and Materia Medica. Text-books.—Wilson's Anatomy and Dunglison's Therapeutics. S. MAUPIN, M. D., Professor of Chemistry and Pharmacy. Text-books.—Fownes' Chemistry and Parrish's Pharmacy. J. E. CHANCELLOR, M. D., Demonstrator of Anatomy. The Faculty invite the attention of the physicians of the Southern States to the peculiar features of the Medical Department of this Institution. 1. Length of Session.—Nearly all the Medical Schools of this country are located in our cities or larger towns, and have only a nominal connexion with the colleges from which they borrow their names and chartered privileges. In these schools the usual length of a session is from four to five months. In order to embrace all the important branches of Medical Science in a course of instruction compressed into so short a term, it is found necessary to employ the services of six or seven Professors, who CATALOGUE. deliver six lectures a day. Under this arrangement, the students, if they take all the tickets, are required to spend nearly the whole of the day in listening to lectures, delivered in rapid succession, and treating of diverse topics. None but those who have had personal experience in this matter, can fully appreciate the troubles and difficulties which beset a student when he first enters the school; the fatigue of body and perplexity of mind which he inevitably experiences in his painful efforts to hear every lecture and master every subject. In attempting, after the close of the lectures for the day, to bring in review the topics discussed by his teachers, he finds links in the chain here and there broken; he flies from one subject of thought to another, without adequately mastering any, and confounded by their number, and the utter impossibility of keeping pace in his private reading at night with the lectures of six Professors, he despairs of doing more than retaining such portion of the facts stated in the lectures as may happen to make the strongest impression on his mind. In the Medical Department of this Institution, the length of the session, which is nine months, enables four Professors to perform all the duties which are elsewhere assigned to six. The students attend but two lectures a day, and thus have ample time for private reading, and for pursuing their Anatomical dissections. The supply of subjects is ample, and the Demonstrator devotes the whole of every afternoon to his duties. He guides the labors of those who are at work, and explains to them the structures which are successively exposed. 2. System of Daily Examinations. Immediately before each lecture, the students in every school of the University are subjected to a rigid examination on the subject of the preceding lecture, or on portions of some approved text-book. Experience has shown that this is an almost indispensable adjunct to the system of teaching by lectures; and the recognition of its importance is so general, that students in other medical schools where its efficient introduction is precluded by want of time, often resort to the expedient of employing the services of private instructors by whom they may be examined at night on the topics discussed each day in the lecture-room. The fee paid by the students for this necessary, but extra collegiate instruction, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. varies from $30 to $50 for the term of lectures, and is usually about $100 for the whole year. The enactments of the University prescribe that no Professor shall engage in pursuits unconnected with its service, or shall receive from the members of his class any compensation besides that provided for by the laws. They further require every Professor to reside within the precincts, for the purpose both of assisting to enforce the discipline of the college, and of being accessible to the students who may seek aid in their hours of private study. These students, then, enjoy advantages here which elsewhere are purchased at a high price over and above the necessary collegiate expenses. 3. Order of Studies. All medical colleges aim to place medical education on a scientific basis. Indeed, if the practice of the healing art is not based on general principles, embodied in the fundamental sciences of Anatomy, Chemistry, Physiology, Pathology and Therapeutics, these branches of medical science might as well be omitted in a course of professional education. If, however, this relation does exist, the propriety and necessity of laying a good foundation before the superstructure can be reared, are too obvious to need illustration. This cannot be done in schools, where the courses on the different branches of medicine are carried on simultaneously. Their system assumes that the students have "read," as it is termed, with a preceptor for a year, at least, before they commence their attendance on lectures. Such, however, is not always the case, and when it occurs, is of comparatively little benefit; for the paramount duties of the practitioner absorb his time, and the fundamental branches of medical science are precisely those demanding for their illustration the appliances which are only to be found within the walls of colleges. The Anatomical Department, for example, is here enriched by a collection of about two hundred large paintings executed to order, with great fidelity and beauty. It is one of the peculiar advantages of the University Medical School, that it unites, as may have been inferred from the preceding remarks, the plan of instruction by private pupilage with that of public lectures; while the length of the session enables the Professors to pursue a philosophical order of studies, and thus to afford the students an opportunity of mastering the elementary CATALOGUE. branches before attention is directed to their practical application. 4. Conditions of Graduation. The regulations for graduation elsewhere require that the student shall have attended two full courses of Medical lectures, and shall have been the private pupil for at least a year, of a respectable practitioner of Medicine. At this University, a consecutive course of nine months being at least equivalent to two courses in most other schools, in respect to the time employed and the advantageous distribution of the subjects of study, the students are permitted to take their diplomas at the end of one session, if they show themselves qualified. The severity of the examinations deters a large majority of the class from making the trial, and none but the perseveringly diligent attain the honor. The importance of the advantages thus claimed for the Medical Department of this Institution, has been tested by the experience of nearly forty years, during which several thousand medical students have been educated here. 5. It will be noticed that those students who prefer taking their diploma at a city school, will yet find it highly beneficial to attend the first course at an Institution organized on the plan of the Medical Department of the University, where the lengthened term, the consecutive arrangement of studies, and the thorough drilling, prepare them to appreciate and improve the advantages they may afterwards enjoy. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.3 Law School. PROFESSOR MINOR. The object in this school is to acquaint the student familiarly and practically with the principles of his profession. With this view, instruction (which is designed to be as thorough as possible) is given partly through text-books and daily examinations upon the subjects taught, partly by comments intended to supply what is deficient and explain what is obscure in the text, and partly also by independent lectures. A Moot Court is instituted in connection with the school, upon a plan which experience has shown to be well calculated to perfect the student in the details of practice. Under the immediate superintendence of the Professor, he is required to pronounce opinions upon supposed cases; to devise and to institute remedies, by suit or otherwise; to conduct suits at law and in chancery, from their inception, through all their stages; to draw wills, conveyances and other assurances; and, in short, to perform most of the functions of a practising lawyer. The School comprises two Departments, each of which is divided into two classes, and the course of study therein is as follows: DEPARTMENT OF COMMON AND STATUTE LAW. Junior Class.—Blackstone's Commentaries, Chitty on Contracts. Senior Class.—Stephen on Pleading, Lomax's Digest of the Law of Real Property, Law of Executors, &amp;c. For Reference.—Virginia Code of 1860, Gordon's Digest of United States Statutes. DEPARTMENT OF EQUITY, MERCANTILE, INTERNATIONAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL LAW, AND GOVERNMENT, ETC. Junior Class.—Vattel's International Law, Lectures on Government, Federalist. CATALOGUE. Senior Class.—Smith's Mercantile Law, Greenleaf's Evidence, Barton's Suit in Equity, Adams' Equity. The degree of Bachelor of Law is conferred upon those who, upon examination, manifest a familiar acquaintance with the subjects taught in all the classes; and to those who exhibit a competent knowledge of International and Constitutional Law, and of the Science of Government, a certificate of proficiency is awarded. ? All the books required can be procured at the book stores near the University on reasonable terms. LICENTIATES. The Faculty have authority to license persons, of suitable attainments, character and habits, to give private instruction in aid of the public teachings in any of the Schools of the University. Licentiates are not at liberty, without special leave of the Faculty, to receive pupils who are not members of the school or schools for which they are licensed, nor to give instruction on subjects not embraced in the plan of the same. The employment of the Licentiate is at the option of the student, and the compensation a matter of private arrangement. EXAMINATIONS. The examinations are of three kinds: 1, the Daily examinations; 2, the Intermediate and Final general examinations; and 3, examinations for graduation. 1.—DAILY EXAMINATIONS. Each Professor, before commencing the lecture of the day, examines his class orally, on the subject of the preceding lecture as developed in the text-book and expounded in the lecture. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. 2.—GENERAL EXAMINATIONS. Two general examinations of each class are held during the session in the presence of a committee of the Faculty, which every student is required to stand. The first, called the Intermediate examination, is held about the middle of the session, and embraces in its scope the subjects of instruction in the first half of the course. The second, called the Final examination, is held in the closing week of the session, and embraces the subjects treated of in the second half of the course. These examinations are conducted in writing. The questions propounded have, each, numerical values attached to them. If the answers of the student are valued, in the aggregate, at not less than three-fourths of the aggregate values assigned to the questions, he is ranked in the first division: if less than three-fourths and more than one-half, in the second division: if less than one-half and more than one-fourth, in the third division: and if less than one-fourth, in the fourth division. Certificates of distinction are awarded to those who attain the first division at one or both of these examinations, and their names are published or announced in the closing exercises of the session. The general examinations are sufficiently comprehensive and difficult to render it impossible for the student, without steady diligence, to secure a place in the first division. The results, whatever they may be, are communicated to parents and guardians respectively, in the final circular of the session. The standing of the student at the daily and general examinations is taken into the account, in ascertaining his qualifications for graduation in any of the schools. 3.—EXAMINATIONS FOR GRADUATION. The examinations for graduation are held in the last month of the session. They are conducted, in each school, by the Professor thereof, in presence of two other Professors, forming with him the committee of examination for the school. The candidates for graduation are subjected to searching interrogations on the details and niceties, as well as the leading principles of the subject, and they are expected to be accurately CATALOGUE. versed in all the topics treated of in the lectures and correlative texts. These examinations are carried on chiefly in writing; but in some of the schools they are partly oral. ? As a due acquaintance with the English language is indispensable to the attainment of even the inferior honors of the institution, all candidates for graduation are subjected to a preliminary examination, to test their qualifications in this respect. DEGREES. The degrees conferred by the University are academic and professional. The Academic Degrees are— 1. That of Proficient—conferred for satisfactory attainments in certain subjects of study, to wit: in Anglo-Saxon; Mineralogy and Geology; Physiology; Medical Jurisprudence; Human Anatomy; Botany; Political Economy; History; Literature; and International Law and Government. 2. That of Graduate in a School—conferred for satisfactory attainments in the leading subjects of instruction in the same, to wit: in the Latin Language and Literature; in the Greek Language and Literature; in the French and German Languages; Pure Mathematics; Natural Philosophy; Chemistry; Moral Philosophy, and History and Literature. The degree of graduate may also be conferred in any one of the Modern Languages, except Anglo-Saxon, and in Mixed Mathematics. 3. That of Bachelor of Arts—conferred on such students as have graduated in any two of the Literary Schools, (Ancient Languages, Modern Languages and Moral Philosophy,) and any two of the Scientific Schools, (Mathematics, Natural Philosophy and Chemistry,) and have attained distinctions, at an Intermediate and Final Examination, in the Junior Classes of the two remaining Schools. 4. That of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia— conferred upon students who have graduated in the Latin, Greek, French and German Languages, Pure Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, Moral Philosophy, and History and Literature, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA.4 and who have passed satisfactory general examinations, in review, on all the subjects embraced in the curriculum. The candidate for the degree of Bachelor or Master of Arts is also required to submit to the approval of the Faculty, an Essay, composed by himself, on some subject of literature or science— which essay must be read by the author on the Public Day, if so ordered. The Professional Degrees are— 1. That of Bachelor of Law—conferred for satisfactory attainments in all the subjects of instruction in the School of Law. And, 2. That of Doctor of Medicine—conferred for satisfactory attainments in all the subjects of instruction, except Botany, in the several schools constituting the Medical Department. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine, who have been previously declared Graduates in Chemistry, or Proficients in Anatomy, Physiology, or Medical Jurisprudence, are not required to stand the examinations on these subjects anew—and the same rule applies to candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Law, who are Proficients in International Law and Government. ? Honorary degrees are forbidden by the laws of the University. PUBLIC DAY. On the closing day of the session, which occurs on the 29th of June, unless that day be Sunday, and then on the 28th, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers and Students of the University assemble in the Public Hall—whither also, the friends of the students and the public generally are invited. On this occasion the results of the examinations are announced, certificates and diplomas awarded, and addresses delivered by the Bachelors and Masters of Arts. CATALOGUE. EXPENSES. The following is an estimate of the expenses of an academic student for the session of nine months, exclusive of the cost of text-books: Matriculation and library fee, $25 Room-rent, if two occupy the same room, each 15 Contingent deposit, 10 Tuition fees in three schools, the usual number attended, 75 Board, including diet, furniture of room and attendance, 180 Deposit for fuel and lights, 35 Washing, $1.50 per mo.—per session, say 15 Infirmary fee, 5 $360 This estimate will be slightly modified if the student enter more or fewer schools than indicated. Law students pay $80 per session for tuition, and Medical students $105: consequently the estimate for the former is $365, and for the latter $390 per session. All the foregoing items are payable in advance, except board and washing. One-third ($60) of the board is required on admission, and the balance in equal instalments, at three and six months thereafter. Washing is paid for monthly, as the service is rendered. The Contingent deposit is designed to cover contingent charges and assessments. These are generally small. The residue of this deposit is refunded to the student in the settlement of his account at the close of the session. The Infirmary fee secures, in case of sickness, prescriptions at the University infirmary, and if needed, nursing by professional nurses, lodging, board and medical attendance by the physicians of the institution, free of additional charge. No abatement is made in the matriculation and tuition fees and room-rent, on account of late entrance; and no portion of the same is refunded, on account of withdrawal before the close of the session—unless the withdrawal be rendered necessary by ill health, and occur before the first of March. The charges for board, fuel and lights and washing are estimated from the time of entrance. Many disadvantages to the student result from late entrance. Therefore, prompt attendance at the beginning of the session is earnestly enjoined upon all who wish to derive the full benefits of the courses of instruction. KEEPING OF STUDENTS' FUNDS. Every student resident within the precincts is expected, on matriculating, to deposit with the Patron all the available funds which he shall have in his possession, or under his control, in any manner intended to defray his expenses while at the University, or on his return thence to his residence. In like manner he should deposit with the Patron all the funds received by him, during the session, for the purpose aforesaid. Students residing out of the precincts would do well to observe the same rule, as a security against accidental loss and improvident expenditure. The Patron will disburse the funds of students on general deposit, upon their order, for all legitimate purposes. PROHIBITION OF CREDIT. An act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students. The license to contract debts, which the chairman is authorized to grant, is confined (except where the parent or guardian otherwise, in writing, requests) to cases of urgent necessity; and these, it is hoped, parents and guardians will, as far as possible, prevent from arising, by the timely supply of the requisite funds. PRIVILEGED STUDENTS. Ministers of the Gospel may attend any of the schools of the University, without the payment of fees to the Professors. The same privilege will be extended to any young man preparing for the ministry, on the following conditions: (1.) He shall submit for the consideration of the Faculty an application, accompanied by testimonials, relating to the fact of his being a bona fide candidate for the ministry, to his good standing in the Church of which he is a member, to his intellectual capacity and his inability to meet the expenses of education at the University without aid. (2.) No Professor shall be required to form a new class or assume any other additional labor for the exclusive benefit of this class of students. (3.) In order to entitle such a student to the privilege of gratuitous instruction in any school of the University during a second session, he must prove his ability to profit by such continued instruction, by exhibiting such evidence of proficiency during the first session as shall be satisfactory to the Professor of the school. The Faculty, at their discretion, may allow any man of undoubted moral character, above the age of twenty-three years, to attend lectures in any of the schools of the University, and to reside out of the precincts, exempt from the rules and regulations prescribed for the government of students, except only that he shall pay the usual Professors' fees, and the usual compensation for the use of the public rooms, and shall observe all those laws of the Institution which enjoin respectful and orderly deportment. But the privilege so allowed may be withdrawn by the Faculty at any time, when, in their opinion, it has been used to the evil example of the students, or otherwise to the injury of the Institution. MONTHLY CIRCULAR. At the end of every month, a circular letter is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from lectures and examinations, and any other irregularity of which he may have been guilty, together with such further information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate. The object of such report being, on the one hand, to incite the student to steady diligence, by eliciting the commendation and encouragement of his friends, and on the other, to restrain him from idleness and disorder, or to urge him to amendment by their admonition and advice, the usefulness of these circulars greatly depends upon the prompt and judicious attention they receive UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. from those to whom they are addressed. Parents and guardians, therefore, cannot be too earnest in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly report may suggest. LIBRARY. The library of the University, originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, and since enlarged by purchases and donations, now contains about 35,000 volumes. Students are allowed the use of the books, under the usual restrictions, and the librarian is present in the library for four hours daily, to attend to their wants. SOCIETY OF ALUMNI. This Association is composed of such former students of the University as, having finally left the Institution, have been elected members at the annual meetings. Its objects are the promotion of letters and general education, as well as the renewal from year to year of the pleasing associations of academic life. The Society holds its meetings at the close of the session. An orator or an essayist is annually appointed by the Society from among its members, and the oration or essay is delivered in the Public Hall on the day preceding the Public Day. LITERARY SOCIETIES. There are two Literary Societies, of long standing, connected with the University. Most of the students become members of one or the other. They meet weekly in their respective Halls, for the purpose of cultivating debate and composition, and occasionally hold public exhibitions. MORALITY AND RELIGION. These are recognized as the foundation and indispensable concomitants of education. The discipline is sedulously administered with a view to confirm integrity, and to maintain a sacred regard for truth. Great efforts are made to surround the students with CATALOGUE. religious influences; but experience has proved that the best way to effect this result is, to forbear the employment of coercion to enforce attendance on religious exercises, which is entirely voluntary. Prayers are held every morning in the Chapel, and divine service is performed on Sunday by a Chaplain, selected, in turn, from the principal religious denominations. By means of a Young Men's Christian Association, new comers are shielded, as much as possible, from vicious connections, and the energies of those willing to engage in the Christian enterprises of the neighborhood are called into active exercise. STATE STUDENTS. To render education at the University accessible to meritorious young men of limited means, provision has been made by the Legislature for the admission of one student from each Senatorial District of the State, without payment of matriculation and tuition fees and rents. This provision is meant to be restricted to those who are not themselves, and whose parents are not, in a situation to incur the expense of their education at this Institution, without aid. State students are appointed by the Faculty upon satisfactory testimonials of fitness. The term of appointment is for two years, but for extraordinary proficiency it may be prolonged. They stand in all respects, except expense, on the same footing as other students, enjoying the same privileges, and subject to the same laws. By way of remuneration to the State for the aid afforded them, they are required, on admission, to sign an engagement to teach in some public or private school in Virginia, for two years, after leaving the University; the emoluments of such service enuring, of course, to their own benefit. The applicant for a State appointment should state his age, (which must be at least seventeen,) and designate the schools of the University he may wish to enter. He should submit satisfactory testimonials of irreproachable moral character, and of capacity, as well by partial cultivation as original vigor of mind, to profit by the instruction given at the University. It should also appear that neither he nor his parents are able to incur the expense of his education without aid. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. The Faculty will proceed on the 30th of June next to make appointments of State students for vacant districts. The following are the districts, all of which are now vacant, except the 5th, 6th, 9th, 12th, 16th, 18th, 20th, 24th and 29th: I. Accomac and Northampton. II. City of Norfolk. III.
