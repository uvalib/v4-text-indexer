To be admitted into the University, the student must be sixteen years of age; but the Faculty are authorized to dispense with this requisition in the case of application for admission by two brothers, one of whom is under the age of sixteen. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he cannot be received, but on producing a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence to the Faculty, with respect to his general good conduct. Every student is free to attend the schools of his choice, and no other than he chooses; with the condition that he shall attend at least three Professors, unless he has the written authority of his parent or guardian, or the Faculty shall for good cause shown allow him to attend less than three. But should he be twenty-one years of age, or more, he is exempt from this condition as to the number of his schools. Before a student matriculates, he is furnished with a copy of the laws, which he is required to read. On matriculating, he signs a written declaration, that he will conform to those laws, and, if he be a resident student, that he has deposited with the Patron all the funds in his possession. COURSE OF INSTRUCTION. The Session commences on the 1st of October, and continues without interruption until the 4th of July. The mode of instruction is by lectures and text books, accompanied by rigid daily and stated examinations. In each school there are three regular lectures a week, besides many others suited to the several subjects into which the school is divided. ACADEMICAL DEPARTMENT. I.âANCIENT LANGUAGES. PROFESSOR HARRISON. In this school are taught the Latin and Greek languages; the Greek and Roman History, Geography, and Literature; and the Hebrew language. The instruction is given partly by lectures and examinations, and partly by comments on portions of the text-books appointed to be read by the student. It embraces the following subjects, distributed according to the classes. I. Junior Latin.â1. General principles and doctrines of the Etymology. 2. The application of these general principles in the explanation of the formation and composition of the words of the language, considered individually, and without regard to their relations to other words in a sentence. The doctrine of the primary and secondary significations of words is considered in connection with this branch of the subject, and is illustrated in the lectures from day to day as occasion may offer. 3. The accidence, or inflectional forms of words, expressing the relations in which they stand to other words in a sentence. These modifications of the forms of words are in like manner explained by the application of the general principles of the Etymology. 4. The Syntax, or laws which govern the relations existing between the several parts of a sentence or discourse, whether indicated by the inflections of words, or by particles. This subject is treated of partly in lectures specially devoted to it, partly by way of prelections and comment on the portions of authors read in the lecture room, and partly in connection with the written exercises. For the above subjects the text-books are the Professor's printed notes, Beck's Latin Syntax, containing the most important parts of the Syntax of Zumpt's Latin Grammar. 5. The doctrine of the quantity of syllables, and the metres. The students are advised to use Carey's Latin Prosody, or Anthon's Prosody, which contains what is most useful in Carey's. 6. The Latin authors used as text-books are Horace, Virgil, Cicero's Orations, and his Epistles ad Diversos, Terence, and CÃ¦sar's Commentaries. The last chiefly with a view to the written exercises. II. Senior Latin.â1. Prelections and commentaries on portions of the classic authors, embracing, besides the other matters necessary for the better understanding of these, a further development of the doctrines of philology taught in the Junior Class. The text-books are Horace, Juvenal, Livy, and Tacitus. 2. Geography of Ancient Italy. The maps of ancient and modern Italy, published by the "Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge," are recommended. 3. Roman History. This subject is taught by prelections, and by examinations on the text-books. These are the History of Rome published by the "Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge," Niebuhr's History of Rome, and the History of Rome in Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopedia. III. Junior Greek.â1. The Etymology, considered in its general principles and in its applications, the Syntax, and the Prosody and metres, are taught to this class in the same way as to the Junior Latin. For these subjects KÃ¼hner's Greek Grammar is the text-book. 2. The Greek authors read and explained in the lecture room, are Xenophon's Anabasis, Herodotus, and a play of Ãschylus or Euripides. The Greek and English Lexicon of Donnegan is that preferred. IV. Senior Greek.â1. Prelections and commentaries on portions of the Greek classic authors, in the same way as in the Senior Latin class, and embracing the like subjects. The Greek authors used as text-books in this class are Euripides, Sophocles, Thucydides, and Homer. The student should have besides KÃ¼hner, Matthiae's Greek Grammar, 5th edition of the translation. 2. Ancient Geography of Greece. The printed notes of the Professor form the text. 3. Ancient History of Greece. It is taught by prelections, and by examinations on the text-books. These are Thirlwall's History of Greece, or the History of Greece in the Library of Useful Knowledge. It is expected of the students of Latin and Greek that they shall read in their rooms such authors and parts of authors, prescribed by the Professor, as cannot be read in the lecture room; e. g.: Cicero's Epistles to Atticus, his Orations (selected), and Treatise "de Republica;" Sallust, Virgil, Terence, Plautus; Ãschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Demosthenes, Ãschines, Thucydides, &amp;c. As an essential part of the plan of instruction, the students of each class are required to furnish written exercises; which consist in the conversion of Latin or Greek into English, and of English into Latin or Greek. The exercises are examined by the Professor, and the errors marked; they are then returned to the students, and the corrections stated and explained in the presence of the class. For these exercises the classic authors are used as the text. V. Hebrew.âThe text-books are Biblia Hebraica, Bush's, Nordheimer's, or Gesenius' Hebrew Grammar, and Gesenii Lexicon Manuale Hebr. et Chald, or Sauerwein's edition of Rehkopf's Lex. Hebr. Chald. In the written translations required as a test of the qualifications of candidates for degrees, the passages used are selected by the committee of examination, not from the portions of authors which have been read and explained in the lecture room, but at will from the classic writers generally. II.âMODERN LANGUAGES. PROFESSOR SCHELE DE VERE. The subjects taught in this school are: 1. The French, Italian, Spanish, and German Languages, and the English in its Anglo-Saxon form, and their literature. 2. The History and Geography of Europe from the fall of the Roman empire to the present day. There are two classes in French, one for beginners, the other for more advanced students; and the same arrangement is made, when necessary, in the other languages. Opportunity is also given to practise speaking the languages. The method of instruction is by lectures, examinations, written exercises, and comments on the text-books as read in the lecture room, the principal classic authors in each language being used for this purpose. Two degrees in this school are required as a condition for obtaining the degree of A. M. III.âMATHEMATICS. PROFESSOR COURTENAY. In this school there are four classes. Of these, the Junior commences with the theory of Arithmetic, the student being supposed to have rendered himself practically familiar with its various rules before entering the University. The elements of Algebra are then taught, and after the first difficulties are mastered, the subjects of Algebra and Synthetic Geometry are pursued simultaneously. In the second or Intermediate Class, after completing the course of Algebra, commenced in the preceding class, there are taught successively the theory of Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, with the application of the former to the measurement of heights and distances, and of the latter to Nautical Astronomy, the theory and practice of Land Surveying and Levelling, Navigation, and Descriptive Geometry, with its applications to Spherical Projections, Shadows, and Perspective. The Senior Class begins with the subject of Analytical Geometry, and subsequently studies the Differential Calculus, concluding the course of Pure Mathematics with the Integral Calculus. There is also a class of Mixed Mathematics, designed exclusively for such of the more advanced students as may desire to study the subjects taught therein. The course embraces the mathematical investigation of the general laws of equilibrium and motion, both of solids and fluids, with a variety of applications, especially to Physical Astronomy. It consists chiefly of selections from the works of Poisson, FrancÅur, Pontecoulant, and others. The instruction in each class is conveyed partly by lectures, and partly by the systematic study of approved text-books, the student being assisted by full and frequent explanations from the Professor, and being constantly subjected to rigid examinations. The progress of the student in every class is also tested by his being required to perform written exercises, in which the principles acquired are applied to the solution of particular problems. The text-books used are: for the Junior Class, Lacroix's Arithmetic, Davies's Bourdon's Algebra, and Legendre's Geometry. For the Intermediate Class, Bourdon's Algebra, Legendre's Geometry and Trigonometry, Davies's Surveying, and Descriptive Geometry. For the Senior Class, Davies's Analytical Geometry, Young's Differential Calculus, and Young's Integral Calculus. Any student entering the school has the privilege of attending all or any of the classes, as he may elect, and if prepared to enter an advanced class, may often find it highly advantageous to review his previous studies by an attendance on a lower class also. IV.âNATURAL PHILOSOPHY. PROFESSOR WILLIAM B. ROGERS. There are three classes in this school: the Junior and Senior classes of Natural Philosophy, and the class of Geology and Mineralogy. In the Junior Class the illustrations are experimental and graphical, with references to the simpler truths of Geometry. In the Senior Class the subjects, where they admit of it, are discussed mathematically. The aim of the course being a comprehensive view of general Physics, the instructions are given chiefly by lectures, though aided from time to time by text-books. The following is the plan of the course. TERRESTRIAL MECHANICS. 1. General or Rational Mechanics; consisting of Statics and Dynamics, or the doctrines of Equilibrium and Motion, and their various applications. 2. Mechanics of Solids.âMolecular Structure of Solids, Excitement and Transfer of Force, Elements of Machinery, Friction, Strength of Materials, Motive Powers, &amp;c. 3. Mechanics of Liquids.âMolecular Structure, Resulting Laws of Equilibrium and Pressure, Flotation, Specific Gravities, Waves, Motion through Pipes, &amp;c., Resistance, Hydraulic Machines, &amp;c. 4. Mechanics of Airs.âMolecular Structure, Elasticity, &amp;c.; Atmosphere, Barometers and FormulÃ¦, Resistance, Pneumatic Machines, Hydro-Pneumatic do., &amp;c. 5. Capillarity and Endosmose.âLaws and Theory of Capillaries, Laws of Diffusion, &amp;c. 6. Acoustics.âMechanism of Molecular Vibrations, Sound-waves, Propagation and Reflection, Musical Vibration of Chords, &amp;c.; Musical Scales and Instruments, Speech and Hearing, &amp;c. 7. Thermotics or Heat.âTemperature, Expansion, Latent and Specific Heat, Heat of Combination, Conduction, &amp;c.; Melloni's Laws, Vapours, Meteorology, Steam Engine, &amp;c. 8. Electricity.â1st. Mechanical. Excitation, Conduction, &amp;c.; Atmospheric; 2d. Chemical. Excitation, Transfer, Effects, &amp;c.; Natural Sources and Application of Electricity, &amp;c. 9. Magnetism.â1st. Statical. Induction, Distribution, &amp;c.; Magnetism of Globe, Dip, &amp;c.; 2d. By Currents. Electro-Magnetic Phenomena and Laws, Thermo-Electricity, &amp;c. 10. Optics.âPropagation, Reflection, Refraction of Light; Chromatics, Dispersion, Polarization, &amp;c.; Theories, Optical Instruments, Photography, the Eye, &amp;c. CELESTIAL MECHANICS OR ASTRONOMY. 1. Descriptive Astronomy.âGeneral View of Celestial Phenomena, Modes of Observing and Computing the Places and Motions of the Heavenly Bodies, Theory of the Celestial Motions, &amp;c. 2. Physical Astronomy.âInvestigation of Forces, Planetary Gravitation, Perturbations, Tides, Nebular Theory, &amp;c. In the class of Geology and Mineralogy especial attention is given to the structure and mineral products of our own country. The great mineral zones are described by reference to maps and sections, the order of stratification pointed out, the nature of the materials shown by specimens, and the relations of all these features to the agriculture and other resources of the country particularly dwelt upon. Modes of exploring are taught, and methods given for the analysis of ores, rocks, and soils. Text-Books.âReference is made in the Junior Class to the works of Herschell, Brewster, Lardner, &amp;c.; in the Senior, to Young's Analytical Mechanics, and Norton's Astronomy; in Geology, to Lyell, Trimmer, or De la Beche, and in Mineralogy, to Allen, Dana, or any of the leading works. V.âCIVIL ENGINEERING. This school comprises the following branches of instruction, viz.: I.âGraphical Mathematics, embracing Descriptive Geometry, Perspective Mensuration, &amp;c. II.âTheory of Levelling and Surveying, both ordinary and topographical. III.âTheory of Roads, Railroads, Canals, Bridges, &amp;c. IV.âTheoretical Mechanics, Hydrostatics and Hydrodynamics, as connected with Engineering. V.âLaws of Heat and Steam, Theory and Construction of the Steam Engine. VI.âGeology and Mineralogy. VII.âLevelling, Surveying, &amp;c., taught practically in the field. VIII.âPlan Drawing, Plotting, Topographical Drawing and Sketching. The subjects named under the six first heads are divided between the Professors of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy. Those included under the 7th and 8th heads are taught by the Teacher of Drawing, under the superintendence of the Professor above mentioned. VI.âCHEMISTRY. PROFESSOR R. E. ROGERS. This subject included in the medical as well as the general academic course, and forming a department of the School of Chemistry and Materia Medica, may be studied separately, or in conjunction with the latter. The Lectures, which are delivered twice a week throughout the session, embrace a very full illustration of all the topics of theoretical or practical importance in the science, and in its applications to Mineralogy, Geology, the Chemical Arts, Agriculture and Physiology. Beginning with an account of the phenomena and laws of Heat, Light, and Electricity, Mechanical and Voltaic, the course next takes up the doctrines of chemical reaction, presenting a full and minute view of the principles of definite combination, with their hypothetical expression in the form of the atomic theory, and illustrating these doctrines by numerous experiments and drawings. To this succeeds Pneumatic Chemistry, in which are discussed the preparation, properties and applications of the various gaseous bodies and their compounds. This is followed by the detailed account of the metals, their oxides, chlorides, and other compounds, connecting with each metal the chemical history of its important salts. A resumÃ¨ is now given, accompanied by illustrations of the various processes of analysis deduced from the preceding facts. Organic Chemistry is next taken up, embracing an account of all the more important organic acids, alkaloids and neutral principles, together with a view of the alcoholic, acetous and other fermentations; the Chemistry of nutrition, growth, respiration, &amp;c., in the vegetable and animal economy, and that of soils and manures as connected with agriculture. In connexion with these topics, minute experimental illustrations are given of all the valuable processes for detecting poisons and for counteracting their effects. The more important operations of analysis, as applied to ores, marls, &amp;c., are also described and exemplified. Throughout the course, use is continually made of ample diagrams illustrating the chemical reactions, according to the method of equivalents; and the bearings of the recent generalizations of Dumas, Liebig, Kane, Graham and others, are particularly referred to. VII.âMORAL PHILOSOPHY. PROFESSOR TUCKER. There are two classes in this school. The Junior Class studies Rhetoric, Belles-Lettres, and Logic, the first half of the session, and Belles-Lettres and Ethics the last half. The Senior Class studies Mental Philosophy the first part of the session, and Political Economy the last. The examinations are on the Professor's Lectures, Brown's Philosophy, Say's Political Economy, Smith's Wealth of Nations, the Professor's works on Money and Banks, and Rents, Wages and Profits. In the Junior Class the examinations are on the Professor's Lectures, Blair's Lectures, Campbell's Rhetoric, Stewart's Active and Moral Powers, and Whately's Logic. The students in this school are also exercised in composition. LAW DEPARTMENT. PROFESSOR H. ST. G. TUCKER. This school is arranged into two classes. The subjects studied by the Junior Class are the Elementary Principles of Municipal Law, the Law of Nature and Nations, the Science of Government, and Constitutional Law. The text books used will be Blackstone's Commentaries, that portion of Kent's Commentaries which treats of Constitutional Law and the Law of Nations, the Federalist, the 3 Virginia Report of '99; in addition to which ample lectures are delivered on the connexion between the Law of Nature and Municipal Law; on the Science of Government and its various forms, particularly the representative and federative; and on the various topics of Constitutional Law discussed in the text-books. In the arrangement of the political part of this course, the Professor's object has been to lay before the student the most able dissertations on both sides of the great constitutional questions which have arisen in our country; to impress upon his mind the inestimable value of the union on the one hand, and the vital importance of preserving the rights of the States on the other; thus guarding him against latitudinarian constructions and the invasion of the reserved rights of the States, while the disorganizing principles which lead to convulsion and disunion are earnestly discarded and industriously controverted. The subjects studied by the Senior Class are the Common and Statute Law, the Principles of Equity and the Maritime and Commercial Law. The text-books will be Stephens on Pleading, Tucker's Commentaries, Smith's Mercantile Law and Starkie's Evidence. The following additional works will be useful to the student for occasional examination: Thomas's Coke, Lomax on Executors, and Lomax's Digest. Junior Class.âPaley's Philosophy, Constitution of Virginia. Those who desire to graduate are required to attend both classes. The design of this arrangement is to embrace in the Junior course those studies which not only form an essential part of a liberal professional education, but which from their universal interest and importance, constitute a highly useful branch of general education: whilst the Senior course is exclusively occupied with the study of the theory and practice of Law, as a profession. Students can attend either or both the classes; and those not wishing to study Municipal Law at all, can enter for that portion of the Junior course which includes National Law, Government and Constitutional Law. On the text-books of both classes, comments are delivered by the Professor, in which it is his object to supply what is deficient, and explain what is obscure in the text, and to offer such remarks as he deems necessary to a thorough understanding of the subject under consideration. In those on Municipal Law, he refers to the leading cases and authorities, American and English, illustrative of the topic treated by the author, and particularly explains in its appropriate connexion, the Statute Law of Virginia and the United States, and its effects on the pre-existing law. Each lecture is preceded by an examination on the last, together with its text. By a recent act of the legislature a diploma in this school dispenses with the necessity of a license from the judges. MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. I.âCHEMISTRY AND MATERIA MEDICA. PROFESSOR R. E. ROGERS. The chemical branch of this school is common to the medical and academical students, and has already been described. Candidates for the medical degree, although not required to graduate previously in chemistry, are expected to have such an acquaintance with the science generally, as is needful for the clear understanding of medical and pharmaceutical chemistry, and the chemistry of functions. The course of Materia Medica embraces: I.âGeneral Therapeutics, or an account of the effects of the various classes of remedies on the organism, and their modus operandi, so far as understood. II.âSpecial Therapeutics, or the application of these agents to individual diseases, as suggested by experience or the theory of the particular disease. III.âA detailed account of the medical agents, in their commercial history, physical properties, chemical habitudes, pharmaceutical preparations, doses, and medical applications. To aid the student in arranging the multifarious details of the subject, and to abridge the labour of note-taking, a tabular digest of all the topics treated of, is at each lecture placed before the class. Upon this and the details of the lecture, the student is expected to be prepared, as well as upon the corresponding parts of the text-book. The means of illustration in Materia Medica are unusually ample, embracing a very full series of specimens of medicines in their various states, and an extensive suite of accurate coloured drawings of medical plants, on an enlarged scale. The lectures on chemistry are delivered twice a week, those on Materia Medica once a week throughout the course. Meetings for examination are held separately generally three times a week. II.âMEDICINE. PROFESSOR HOWARD. In this school are taught Medical Jurisprudence, Obstetrics, the Principles and Practice of Medicine. It is composed of two classes. One of Medical Jurisprudence, and consisting of law, academical and medical students. The other of Obstetrics, the Principles and the Practice of Medicine, and consisting wholly of medical students. To allow the medical student time to attain proficiency in Anatomy and Physiology, Chemistry and Materia Medica, before he is required to apply these branches in the study of the Principles and the Practice of Medicine, the course is opened with Medical Jurisprudence, which is followed by Obstetrics, and both are completed before the Principles or the Practice of Medicine are taken up. MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE. The lectures on this branch show the aid which legislation and the administration of the laws derive from medicine, and consist chiefly of the application of the principles of medical science to the elucidation and administration of the laws, and the legal decisions in cases of insanity, every variety of mental impairment, crime, &amp;c., &amp;c. Text-books the Professor's Outlines, and Beck. OBSTETRICS. The lectures on this branch comprehend an account of all labours, natural, preternatural, and instrumental, the professional assistance to be afforded in each, the treatment of the female before, during, and after delivery, and the diseases of infancy. The lectures are amply illustrated by specimens and plates, and all manual evolutions, and the application of instruments, are demonstrated on the improved phantome of Hebermehl. The students also practise manual and instrumental delivery on the mannikin. Text-books, the last edition of Meigs, and Moreau. THE PRINCIPLES OF MEDICINE. The Principles of Medicine, as taught in this school, comprise General Pathology, and a brief view of General Therapeutics; also Etiology, Nosology, Semeiology, Diagnosis, and Prognosis. The nature and division of causes are first considered, which introduces the student to their effectsâdiseases. Pathology proper is next considered under the two forms, Functional and Structural diseases. Functional diseases, being composed of elements, ultimate and proximate, are analyzed into their constituent parts, and the elements considered separately before they are contemplated in combination. Structural diseases being rarely confined to one anatomical element, cannot be strictly distinguished into ultimate and proximate elements, and are therefore arranged under the three heads, increased, diminished, and perverted nutrition. After the student thoroughly understands the nature of the causes of diseases, their divisions, modes of operation, and the resulting effects upon function and structure in the ultimate and proximate elements of disease, a general view is given of the influences that can be brought to remove or counteract their elements. And the course on the Principles is then concluded by the consideration of nosology, semeiology, diagnosis, prognosis, and the different modes of death. Text-books, Williams's Principles. PRACTICE OF MEDICINE, OR SPECIAL PATHOLOGY AND SPECIAL THERAPEUTICS. As the most natural and practically useful arrangement, all local diseases are classified and treated of according to their locality, or the organ or set of organs which they affect, whilst general diseases are arranged altogether pathologically. Much attention is given to Physical Diagnosis. Pathological Anatomy occupies a conspicuous place in the course, and is illustrated by Carswell's large and splendid coloured plates, and, when practicable, by specimens. Text-books, second edition of Dunglison's Practice, and Clymer's Williams'. III.âANATOMY, PHYSIOLOGY, AND SURGERY. PROFESSOR CABELL. There are two classes in this school, one of Anatomy and Surgery, the other of Physiology. In the former, the lectures are illustrated by the demonstration of wet and dry anatomical preparations, by the use of the best drawings, and especially by dissections of fresh subjects, with which the school is abundantly supplied. As, owing to the length of the session, the medical students attend but two lectures a day, ample time is allowed them for private dissection. In the lectures on Physiology are considered, after a brief notice of the structure of the human organs, their functions, or the actions by which they fulfil special offices in the economy of the human system, the mode in which these actions are accomplished, and the influence of external agents, as well as of the reaction of the organs on each other, whether as healthful stimuli or sources of disease. The Professor aims to adapt his lectures in this class to the wants of the unprofessional student, who may desire to include in a course of liberal education an acquaintance with the general principles of the science of life. In the class of Anatomy and Surgery, the students are examined during the first half of the session on the Professor's lectures, and on some approved treatise on Human Anatomy recently published, such as Goddard's Wilson's Anatomy, Pancoast's Wistar's Anatomy, Horner's General and Special Anatomy, or Pattieson's Cruveilhier's Anatomy. In the last half of the session this class studies Surgery, and is examined on the Professor's lectures and on Druitt's Modern Surgery. The examinations on Physiology are on the Professor's lectures and on some one of the recent works on this science, such as Dunglison's Human Physiology, or Carpenter's Human Physiology. ORGANIZATION OF THE MEDICAL DEPARTMENT. The organization of the Medical Department of the University of Virginia having been framed with a view to incorporate with the system of instruction by public lectures the important advantages of private pupilage, presents peculiarities to be found in no other School of Medicine in the Union. It would be needless to detail the circumstances by which the University has been enabled to secure to Virginia and to the South generally, all the benefits of a school so advantageously organized, but it is deemed right, after several years of successful operation, during which upwards of eight hundred medical students have been educated, that the public should be made acquainted with the peculiarities of a plan which ample experience has shown to be admirably calculated to fulfil the intentions of its founders. 1. Unlike other Medical Schools, the session is of the same length as the academic session, nine months, and but two lectures are delivered on the same day. This arrangement, while it enables three Professors to perform all the duties which in other schools, with shorter sessions, are assigned to six, affords the student unusual facilities for acquiring gradually, and thereby digesting, the information conveyed to him by oral instruction, without that confusion of thought and fatigue of mind which are inevitable when, as always happens in city schools, he has to encounter daily six or seven lectures delivered in rapid succession. 2. Immediately before each lecture the students are subjected to a full and rigid examination on the subject of the preceding lecture, or on portions of some approved text-book. This practice of daily examinations, constituting one of the peculiar features in the organization of this school, enables the Professors to explain both the obscurities of the text, and such parts of their lectures as may appear to be imperfectly understood by the class, and thus supplies the student with a most valuable means of fixing in his mind correct information, while it has an incidental advantage in familiarizing him with the mode of trial to which he is subjected in his final examination for graduation. 3. The length of the session renders practicable such a division of the subjects of study, that the student has an opportunity of being well grounded in the elementary branches of medical science before he is required to listen to discourses on more complicated subjects. It is, then, apparent, that this institution offers to students of medicine facilities not found in other schools for commencing as well as completing the study of their profession, while its connexion with a general University, and its other features as already adverted to, will afford them the most favourable opportunity for laying the foundation of a liberal, scientific, and professional education. 4. Any person of approved moral conduct may offer as a candidate for graduation, and receive the degree of M. D., without reference to the time he has been engaged in the study of Medicine, or of joining the school, provided he undergoes in a satisfactory manner the various examinations prescribed by the enactments. 5. Connected with the Medical School is an Anatomical and Pathological Museum, which has been lately enriched with valuable and rare specimens, selected in Paris by one of the Professors. An annual appropriation is allowed by the authorities of the University for the purpose of procuring subjects, so that ample means for the study of Practical Anatomy are thus afforded to each student at the trifling cost of five dollars. The students have ready access to the public library, containing in its medical department most of the standard works of the profession, and several sets of splendid anatomical plates. 6. The expenses for the entire session of nine months, commencing on the first of October, are limited to $228âa sum not exceeding that which is paid for a session of four months in city schools. It provides for board, including bed and other room furniture, washing and attendanceâfuel and candlesârent of dormitoryâuse of library and other public roomsâfees to the Professors âdissecting fees and subjects for dissection. As the Philadelphia and other city schools require as a condition for graduation that the candidate shall have attended two full courses of lectures, and recognise one course in this institution as equivalent to one of their own, students who wish to take their diplomas in Philadelphia, will yet find an advantage in availing themselves, for the first session, of the peculiar benefits of a school organized on the plan above described. EXAMINATIONS. These are of three kinds; first, the daily examinations, which precede or alternate with the lectures; second, the public examinations, two in number, held the one about the middle of the session, the other at its close; and third, the examinations for graduation, held towards the end of the session. DAILY EXAMINATIONS. In the daily examinations the student is questioned both upon the subjects of the preceding lecture and such portions of the text-book as may have been designated by the Professor. His preparation thus tested is noted numerically at the time of examination, and the mean of these numbers, indicating his average standing in each class, is communicated to his parent or guardian in the printed circular which is sent home at the close of every month. The literary value attached to the numbers thus used is seen in the following table: 5 signifies very well prepared. 4 signifies well prepared. 3 signifies tolerably prepared. 2 signifies badly prepared. 1 signifies very badly prepared. 0 signifies entirely unprepared. PUBLIC EXAMINATIONS. The two public examinations, embracing respectively all the subjects treated of in the first half, and all those treated of in the second half of the session, are thus conducted: The Professor of the school prepares in writing a series of questions to be proposed to the class, and affixes to them numerical values, according to his estimate of their relative difficulty. On the assembling of the class for examination, these questions are for the first time presented to them; and they are required to answer in writing in a prescribed time, without communication with one another or with other persons, and without any reference to books. Their answers are subsequently carefully examined and compared, and a value attached to each, not exceeding that of the corresponding question. In the schools of languages subjects may also be selected for oral examination, and the values of these exercises are marked at the time. The students are then arranged into four divisions, according to the merit of their examination, as determined by the following method: The numerical values attached to all the questions are added together, and also the values of the answers given by each student. If this last number amounts to three-fourths of the first, the student is ranked in the first division; if it be less than three-fourths, and as much as one-half, in the second; if less than one-half, and as much as a fourth, in the third; if less than a fourth, in the fourth division. The examinations are conducted and the results ascertained by a committee, consisting of the Professor of the school and two other Professors. The standing of the student at these examinations is communicated to his parent or guardian in the last circular of the session. Those who attain the first division receive in public, at the close of the session, a printed certificate of their distinction at one or both of the examinations, as the case may be, and their names are mentioned in the published account of the proceedings which terminate the course. These public examinations, though less thorough than the examinations for graduation, are sufficiently comprehensive and difficult to render it impossible for the student, without steady diligence, to secure a place in the first division. EXAMINATIONS FOR GRADUATION. These are partly oral and partly in writing, and are conducted by the Professor of the Department, in the presence of two other Professors, forming with him the committee of examination for the school. Here the student is subjected to searching interrogations upon the details and niceties as well as the leading principles of the subject, and he is expected to be accurately versed in all the topics treated of in the lectures and the correlative texts. As a due acquaintance with our own language is made indispensable to the attainment of even the inferior honours of the University, all candidates for degrees are subjected to an examination, in order to test their qualifications in this respect. At this, which is called the English Examination, and is held near the close of the session, the student is called upon to correct in writing numerous errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation, and is required to prepare at the time a short composition on some appointed theme. DEGREES. These are of two classes, Academical and Professional. The Academical degrees are first, that of Proficient in certain special departments of a school; second, that of Graduate in a school; and third, that of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia. The degree of Proficient, otherwise called a certificate of proficiency, applies only to those branches of some of the schools which by the regulations the student is allowed to attend separately. These are Geology and Mineralogy, Political Economy, Medical Jurisprudence, Logic, Physiology, and Constitutional Law and Government. The degree of Graduate in a school embraces, in the school of Ancient Languages, the Latin and Greek Languages; in that of Modern Languages, any two of the languages taught in the school; in that of Mathematics, all the studies of the school except the mixed mathematics; in that of Natural Philosophy, the same, omitting Geology and Mineralogy; in that of Chemistry, the same, omitting Materia Medica: in that of Moral Philosophy, the same, omitting Political Economy and Belles Lettres. The degree of 4 Graduate is also conferred in each of the Languages separately and in the Mixed Mathematics. None are admitted to these degrees who fail to give satisfactory evidence of their attainments at the public examinations and the examinations for graduation. THE DEGREE OF MASTER OF ARTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA. To merit this, the highest academical honour of the institution, the student must have already become a graduate in the following schools. ANCIENT LANGUAGES, MODERN LANGUAGES, MATHEMATICS, NATURAL PHILOSOPHY, CHEMISTRY, MORAL PHILOSOPHY. He must moreover give proof of an accurate and comprehensive acquaintance with his entire course of studies, by an examination on all these subjects, in the presence of the whole Faculty, at the close of his academical career. And lastly, he must prepare and submit to the Faculty an essay or oration, exhibiting a due degree of literary ability, and this, if so directed, he is required to read or deliver on the Public Day. The Professional Degrees are that of Doctor of Medicine, conferred on graduates in the Medical Department; and Bachelor of Laws, on graduates in the School of Law. To merit the degree of Doctor of Medicine, the student must prove by his examinations, that he has made satisfactory attainments in Anatomy, Surgery, Physiology, Principles and Practice of Medicine, Obstetrics, Materia Medica, Chemistry, and Medical Jurisprudence. To attain the degree of Bachelor of Laws, he must in the same manner give evidence of a due acquaintance with the Law of Nature and Nations, the Science of Government, and Constitutional Law, Municipal Law, including the Common and Statute Law, the principles of Equity, and Commercial Law. Honorary Degrees are expressly forbidden by the laws of the University. THE PUBLIC DAY. On the closing day of the session, which, unless where Sunday interferes, occurs on the 4th of July, the visiters, faculty officers, and students, and the Society of Alumni, assemble in the Rotunda, whither also are invited the friends of the students, and the public generally. On this occasion the certificates and diplomas are awarded to the successful candidates, the results of the examinations are announced, and addresses are delivered by one or more of the Masters of Arts, and by the Orator appointed by the Society of Alumni. EXPENSES. The expenses for the session of upwards of nine months, (commencing the 1st of October, and ending the 4th of July following,) are as follows: Board, including bed and other room furniture, washing and attendance, $110 Fuel and candles, to be furnished by the Proctor at cost, and 5 per cent. commission, estimated, if only one student in the dormitory, at $30, if two students in the dormitory, at 15 Rent of an entire dormitory $16; for half, if occupied by two students, 8 Use of the library and public rooms, 15 Feesâif one Professor be attended, $50; if two, each $30; if more than two, each $25âsay, 75 Total, exclusive of books and stationary, clothing and pocket money, $223 In addition to the regular fee, $20 is paid by students who attend the Senior Class in the School of Law. When the student attends only the class of Geology and Mineralogy, in the School of Natural Philosophy; of Materia Medica, in the School of Chemistry; of Physiology, in the School of Anatomy; of Medical Jurisprudence, in the School of Medicine; or of National Law, Government, and Constitutional Law, in the School of Law, the fee is fifteen dollars each. Ministers of the gospel, and young men preparing for the ministry, may attend any of the schools of the University, without payment of fees to the Professors. The expenses of the students resident in the University, are limited as follows: 1. For board, the use of the dormitory and public rooms, and tuition fees, the sums before stated. 2. For clothing during the session, an amount not exceeding one hundred dollars. 3. For pocket money, during the session, a sum not exceeding forty-five dollars. 4. For books and stationary, whatever the parent or guardian may think fit to allow. 5. For medicine and medical attendance, whatever may be necessary. These are in no case to be exceeded, unless under special circumstances the Faculty shall allow it. PROHIBITION OF CREDIT. The Act of the Legislature prohibiting merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting students, is here strictly enforced. The license to contract debts, which the chairman is authorized to grant, is confined, (except where the parent or guardian otherwise in writing requests,) to cases of urgent necessity; and these it is hoped that parents and guardians will, as far as possible, prevent from arising by the timely supply of the requisite funds. HOTELS OR BOARDING-HOUSES. Hotels or boarding-houses are provided within the precincts for the accommodation of students; and no student is permitted to board or lodge out of the precincts, unless in the family of his parent or guardian. Except, that students above the age of twenty-one years may reside out of the precincts, in such private boardinghouses as the Faculty may approve. The charges at the private boarding-houses, those licensed by the Faculty, are required by the regulations not to exceed those of the hotels within the precincts. The hotel-keepers are bound to maintain good order among their boarders during meals, and to report all cases of misconduct of which they have knowledge, whether occurring in their own houses or elsewhere. KEEPING OF STUDENTS' FUNDS. Every student resident within the precincts, is required, on matriculating, to deposit with the Patron, all the money, checks, bills, drafts, and other available funds, which he shall have in his possession, or under his control, in any manner intended to defray his expenses while at the University, or on his return from thence to his residence. Nor shall he matriculate till he shall have deposited a sum at least sufficient, after deducting the Patron's commission, (two per cent.,) to pay for the use of his dormitory and the public rooms, to pay the fees of the Professors, whom he may design to attend, to pay three months' board to his hotel-keeper, to purchase the text-books and stationary which he may want at the commencement, and twenty dollars on account of fuel and candles, and ten dollars to cover contingent charges and assessments against him for injuries to the buildings, &amp;c.. which two last mentioned sums are credited in the final settlement of his accounts. In like manner, he shall deposit with the Patron all the funds which he shall receive while a student of the University, for the purpose aforesaid. At the end of the first three months of the session, he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the next three months; and at the expiration of the second period of three months, he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the residue of the session. Students resident out of the University, are required on matriculating, to deposit with the Patron funds sufficient, after deducting the Patron's commission, to pay the fees of Professors whom they may propose to attend, the sum charged for the use of the public rooms, and ten dollars to cover contingent charges. PRIVILEGED STUDENTS. The Faculty at their discretion, may allow any man, of undoubted moral character, above the age of twenty-three years, to attend lectures in any of the schools of the University, and to reside out of the precincts, exempt from the rules and regulations prescribed for the government of students; except only, that he shall pay the usual Professors' fees, and the usual compensation for the use of the public rooms, and shall observe all those laws of the Institution which enjoin respectful and orderly deportment. But the privilege so allowed may be withdrawn by the Faculty, at any time, when in their opinion it has been used to the evil example of the students, or otherwise to the injury of the Institution. MONTHLY CIRCULARS. At the end of every month, a circular letter is addressed by the chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his average standing for the month in each of his classes, his absences from lecture and examination, and any other irregularities of which he may have been guilty; together with such further information as to the student's progress and conduct, as it may be deemed proper to communicate. The object of such report, being on the one hand to incite the student to steady diligence by eliciting the commendation and encouragement of his friends, and on the other to restrain him from idleness and disorder, or to urge him to amendment by their admonition and advice; the usefulness of these circulars greatly depends upon the prompt and judicious attention they receive from those to whom they are addressed. Parents and guardians therefore cannot be too earnest in communicating such advice or encouragement as the monthly reports may suggest. LIBRARY. The Library of the University, originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, has since been augmented by two very valuable donations, the one a legacy from Mr. Madison, the other from a generous and enlightened citizen of Richmond, the late Christian Bohn, Esq. Through these additions, and the annual increase by purchase, it now numbers upwards of 17,000 volumes, comprising an unusually large proportion of standard literary and scientific works, in the principal European languages, together with a rich and extensive collection of engravings. Under certain restrictions, students are allowed the use of the books, and the Librarian is in attendance at stated hours to comply with their orders and to receive the books returned. SOCIETY OF ALUMNI. This association is composed of such former students of the University as having graduated in one or more departments, have subsequently on nomination been elected members, at the annual meetings. Its objects are the promotion of letters and general education, as well as the renewal from year to year of the pleasing associations of academic life. The society holds its meetings at the close of the session, commencing business usually on the 3d and terminating on the 4th of July. An orator or essayist is annually appointed by the society from among its members, and the oration or essay is generally delivered in the Rotunda on the Public Day, at the conclusion of the academical proceedings. RELIGIOUS EXERCISES. Divine service is performed in the chapel every Sunday morning and Wednesday evening during the session, by the Chaplain of the University, who is appointed in turn from the principal religious denominations. Students also have the opportunity of attending service at any of the churches in Charlottesville.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">EXTRACTS FROM A REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES, TO THE LEGISLATURE, AGAINST THE EXPEDIENCY OF WITHDRAWING THE ANNUITY FROM THE UNIVERSITY. The committee of schools and colleges having as directed by a resolution of the house of delegates, passed on the 22d day of December, 1844, carefully investigated the past history and present condition and influences of the University of Virginia, with the view of forming their opinion upon the question of "repealing the act of assembly granting an annuity of 15,000 dollars" to that institution, beg leave to report the following facts and considerations as the result of their inquiries: On reverting to the known intentions of the illustrious founder of the university, and his distinguished co-labourers, and of the legislatures by whose enlightened liberality it was set in operation, we recognise as the leading object of its establishment, the institution of a higher and more thorough system of intellectual training, than had yet been attempted either in our own or any of the sister states, and through this means, the introduction of a better intellectual culture in our colleges, academies and elementary schools. In the period of twenty years, which comprises the as yet brief history of the university, it would be unreasonable to expect more than a very partial attainment of all the salutary objects which inspired the hopes of its founders. The great literary institutions of the old world, which now exercise so benign an influence on the progress of letters and of general education, have gathered their strength to do good by the slow growth of successive ages; and although in our own time and country more speedy effects are to be anticipated, because wiser and more practical methods of culture are adopted, the extensive diffusion of these good influences through the public mind is necessarily a gradual, though a continually progressive operation. That the university has been successful in establishing within our borders a higher and more thorough system of scientific and literary training than had previously been accessible any where in the United States, is, we think, admitted by all who are familiar with its course of studies, and with the influences these have exerted through its well trained alumni on the methods and aims of academic teaching in many sections of the state. In proof of this, referring in the first place simply to the training of its own students in literature and science, whether professionally or with general objects, we would call attention to the extent and thoroughness of the instruction which it offers, and to the system of intellectual culture it adopts. SYSTEM OF INTELLECTUAL CULTURE. On comparing the system of intellectual culture adopted in this institution with that in use in the higher seminaries of learning in other states, we remark two distinctive features, which, from their influence upon the interests of education, may be deemed worthy of especial note. The first is the privilege allowed to students of selecting such studies as have a more immediate reference to the pursuits in which they design afterwards to engage, and the second, the practice of combining to an unusual extent oral instruction in the form of lectures, with the use of text-books. Election of Studies: The former of these peculiarities of system, originating in a wise regard to the practical wants of society, has been found well adapted to the genius of our country, and at the same time eminently favourable to that thoroughness of knowledge which in a just plan of education is even more important than variety of attainment. In virtue of this system, the student preparing for divinity, law, or medicine, is enabled to secure substantial attainments in ethics, metaphysics, and political economy, or in chemistry and general physics; the young engineer, in mathematics, mechanics, and geology; and the incipient teacher, in the languages, mathematics, belles lettres, and such other portions of knowledge as will accomplish him for his intended pursuits; while in neither case is he required to spend his resources and his time in the acquirement of branches which are but slightly related to the objects he has in view. Nor does the privilege thus granted often lead, on the part of those who aim at a general education, to a neglect of the more difficult but yet indispensable branches of study, since custom has established a particular order of studies to which, with some modifications, the great majority conform. Besides, all are aware that, although a separate diploma is conferred in each department, nothing short of a full and thorough course in all the academic schools can prepare the student for the highest honours to which he may aspire. It is not unworthy of remark, that the advantages of such an election of studies, clearly evinced in the experience of the University, have been substantially recognised of late by the adoption at Harvard, and we believe other prominent institutions abroad, of a similar feature, to replace the Procrustes system hitherto in general use. But we may be allowed to add, that, while engrafting upon their old established methods this liberal improvement, they have allowed much latitude of election even to their candidates for the higher honours, and thus departing from the stern requisitions of our University, have held out inducements to the student to choose his studies rather in accordance with his fancy or love of ease, than with the claims of a rigorous mental discipline and a more profound and thorough scholarship. Instruction by Lectures along with Text-Books: Adverting now to the other distinctive feature in the system of the University, the extensive use of lectures as a means of training and instruction, we would call attention to the fact that distinguished scholars abroad agree in regarding this mode of teaching as the most valuable improvement in the plan of university instruction witnessed in modern times, and that they ascribe to its inciting influences, both upon teachers and their pupils, much of that marvellous advancement in letters and science which has made so many of the seats of learning of the old world the renowned centres of a knowledge no less beneficent than bright. The advantages of an extensive use of this method in association with text-books, as compared with the old and still very usual practice of exclusive text-book study and recitation, although as yet but imperfectly recognised in many of the colleges in this country, must, we think, become apparent from considering first, the greater impressiveness of knowledge orally conveyed, and secondly, the more wholesome discipline of the faculties which such a method renders habitual. Respecting the former of these considerations, it may be enough to add, that this greater force and permanency of the impressions made upon the mind by the teachings of the lecturer, proceeding from a very simple law of our mental organization, is exemplified by the familiar experience of all, as well in the lessons imparted to infancy by maternal lips as in the oral instructions descending from the forum, the pulpit, and the bar. In proof of the prevailing conviction on this subject in Europe as well as at home, reference might be made to the eagerness with which crowds of all classes of society gather around the desk of the distinguished expounder of philosophy, science, or taste, and the earnest activity of thought with which they analyze and assimilate the knowledge he imparts. Indeed, so highly is this method of teaching valued at the present day, that while it has been made a prominent feature in the system of all the most active and successful institutions of learning in the old world, and has been legitimately applied as a most efficient mean of popular instruction by the learned and wise, it has not unfrequently been spuriously employed to deceive the simple and to tax the purses and the credulity of the uninformed. In judging of its good influences we should bear in mind that they show themselves as much in the increased vivacity, clearness and originality of thought excited in the teacher, as in the quickened apprehension and sharpened criticism of those whom he instructs, and that thus by a reactive sympathy of thought the one becomes better qualified to teach, and the other more ready fully 5 to appropriate the lessons he receives. It is true, that unaided by the systematic study of well-selected books, mere lectures alone would prove but an ineffective means of thorough collegiate instruction. But when united with the daily or occasional study of a text-book, they conduce, as we think, to a more wholesome discipline of the faculties than any other collegiate system could secure. Experience has amply shown that a large proportion of the students at academies and higher institutions, where book-lessons are confided in too much, fall into a mechanical routine of unreflecting labour, and discovering that it is easier to remember words than to analyze and compare ideas, cease to apply the higher faculties of thought to the subject of their studies. And even where this worst of all the abuses of scholastic training does not follow, we but too generally find them resting with implicit confidence on the reasonings, and resorting to the very language of their book, without so much as daring to frame for themselves other arguments or illustrations, or even imaging that such are to be discovered. Thus habitually leaning upon the thoughts, and repeating the words of others, accustomed to be satisfied with whatever stands in verba magistri, their powers of thought are but imperfectly developed, and whatever of invention they may have had is enfeebled or paralysed by disuse. Inured to influences such as these, and scarcely permitted to walk alone, how little is the mind prepared for that vigorous and independent exercise of its powers demanded in the pursuits of life, and how utterly unfit for the hardy achievements of original and inventive genius? Glancing now at the other, and, as we believe, far better method of instruction, we discern a different order of effects. Here the pupil, accustomed in the lectures of his teacher to hear doubtful questions discussed, and to see new proofs and illustrations given of established truths, catches the enthusiasm of critical or inventive thought, and learns to reason and to demonstrate for himself. Taught by his own efforts rightly to value the systems of philosophy and science, and the productions of taste, which have been wrought out by the master minds of our race, he acquires a deep reverence for their authority, because it is the authority of truth. But along with this modest deference to the oracles of knowledge, he cherishes that manly self-dependence of thought which springs from the conscious vigour due to the free training of his faculties; and when he quits the hall of alma mater, he carriers with him the spirit of an intellectual freeman beneath the bright insignia of his first literary achievement. HONORARY DEGREES NOT GRANTED AT THE UNIVERSITY. While referring to those features in the organization of the University which distinguish it from most of the leading institutions in this country, and which are regarded by its friends as among its highest merits, it is appropriate to state, that by an express law its authorities are forbidden to grant honourary degrees, and that accordingly no diploma of compliment has ever yet received its imprimatur. In most other colleges and universities, as is well known, such honours are extended not only to those who have earned some reputation in divinity, medicine, or law, or even in the uncongenial pursuits of party politics, but are accorded as of course in the case of master of arts, after the interval of a few years, to all who have taken their first academical degree. Rejecting a system so little friendly to true literary adancement, the legislators of the University have, we think wisely, made their highest academic honour, that of master of arts of the University of Virginia, the genuine test of diligent and successful training, and disdaining such literary almsgiving, have firmly barred the door against the demands of spurious merit and noisy popularity. INFLUENCE OF THE UNIVERSITY IN IMPROVING THE SYSTEM OF INSTRUCTION AT ACADEMIES AND COMMON SCHOOLS. Having thus shown satisfactorily, as we think, that the University is in reality accomplishing the leading purpose for which it was established, to wit, the institution of a high and thorough system of literary and intellectual training worthy of our age and state, let us briefly glance at the influences it has exerted upon the methods and aims of academic and ordinary teaching in various sections of the commonwealth. Bearing in mind the short period to which its operations have been limited, and the unyielding hostility with which new modes and objects of instruction are ever greeted by the lovers of the old regime, we discover much matter for rejoicing in the already signal advances which, through the efforts of some of its alumni, it has effected in the system of academic education in various quarters of the State. In the admirable institutions which they have established, following the general course of training by which their own powers were conducted to honourable scholarship at the University, they have annually furnished to their alma mater, in the pupils they have sent, the highest evidence of the excellence of their instructions. Without intending to draw invidious distinctions, where there is so much to commend in all, we may be allowed to refer in proof of what we have said, to the academies of Powers, Tutwiler, Maupin, Coleman, Harrison, Davis, Bushnell, Barksdale, Galt, Slaughter, McKee, Turner, Saunders, &amp;c., as not only excelling in true scholarship any similar institutions previously within the borders of Virginia, but as more than vieing in extent and thoroughness of training, in the languages, mathematics and general physics, with most of the highly reputed colleges of the land. From such centres of sound instruction there cannot fail to be diffused better systems of mental culture not only among the other academies but the inferior class of schools, and as they steadily increase in number and influence, we may confidently anticipate a general extension of these salutary effects. Were special evidence required of the improvement thus effected by the University in the education of the poorer class of our citizens, numerous instances could be adduced, taken from various quarters of the state, of teachers of the poor trained at the University or in the schools of her alumni, carrying into their humbler sphere all the precious benefits of the wisest methods of instruction. We may thus regard each of the higher academies conducted by the alumni as a normal school for an extensive neighbourhood, destined by its example and by the teachers it sends forth, to banish from the inferior schools the ignorant pretension which has heretofore so generally occupied the chair of instruction, and to supply its place by the clear and really profitable teachings of men trained to accurate knowledge and enlightened methods. Looking to those alumni who have attached themselves to the learned professions, to agriculture or to public affairs, and many of whom, though young, are already earning the substantial honours due to genius disciplined and enriched by strenuous academic toil, the friends of the university cannot doubt that they also, shedding their useful light around, whether by quiet social influence, or energetic efforts in the public councils, are giving their earnest and efficient aid in the extension of sound education throughout the commonwealth. NUMERICAL SUCCESS OF THE UNIVERSITY. But while as we have seen the great objects of the founders of the University have been fulfilled so far as the method and extent of its instructions are concerned, it cannot be disguised that in another respect their hopes have been less fully realized. In the number of the students annually frequenting its halls, their sanguine calculations are found to have outstripped the progress of the institution. Yet it should here be remarked "that the number of individuals who receive at the University of Virginia the benefits of a collegiate education, is far greater than could be inferred from a comparison with the numbers of other similar institutions in other parts of the Union, since in these, in consequence of that gradation of classes through which every student is required to pass, most students continue at college four years; whereas under the system pursued here of allowing the student to attend such schools only as he selects, and to give his undivided attention to them, he obtains the honours of which he is most ambitious in a much shorter time. It would seem from comparing the whole number of students at the University in the last ten years, (1182,) with the number of matriculations in the same time, 2058, that the average term of their continuance is less than two years. In this way the number educated here may be equal to the number educated in colleges whose average annual number of students may be twice as great. The number of new students annually received at the University has in ten years averaged 118, and it is believed that there are not two colleges or universities in the Union, which have, on an average, received a greater number." But while it would thus appear that the University even in this point of view has been far more successful than is often imagined, various influences have co-operated in debarring it from that great numerical prosperity which seems to have warmed the anticipations of its founders. Injurious impressions as to the irreligious tendencies of the institution.âAmong the causes of this shortcoming, especially in the earlier years of its history, we may in the first place mention the opinion very prevalent at the time, that irreligious influences were permitted and even exerted within its walls. An opinion which, though we are happy to say now very generally abandoned, is still found casting a shade of prejudice over the feelings of a few. Without entering into any inquiry as to the foundation of this impression as prevailing in former years, it is not inappropriate here to state, that no shadow of a pretext now exists, or has for many years existed, favourable to such a suspicion. We speak on the authority of the numerous pious divines of our own state and from abroad, who have either officiated as chaplains at the University, or have otherwise become familiar with its internal influences and usages, when we assert, that in no similar institution in this country, is there a greater degree of respect voluntarily accorded to the ministers and ordinances of Christianity, and in few are more numerous instances to be found of devout piety as well among the students as the professors and their families. In further proof of the prevailing disposition on this subject at the University, we may point to the fact that the chaplain, appointed annually from among the leading denominations in our state, is supported exclusively by the voluntary contributions of the professors and other officers, and of the students, and that through the same means a Bible Society and Sunday School have long been in useful operation. It is but proper in this place to add, that while enjoying these high religious opportunities, the University, by the annual succession of chaplains of different denominations, is secured from that sectarian influence which in any other arrangement could not fail to impair its usefulness as a state institution. Defective discipline in the early years of the University: Another obstacle to the numerical success of the institution, perhaps more influential even than that just stated, has arisen from the errors of discipline committed in the early period of its history. In an enterprise so novel in many of its features, it is not surprising that the scheme of organization, however good throughout in theory should in some of its details have proved vicious or inadequate in practice. During this experimental stage of its career, it is well known that habits of dissipation and extravagance, with other offensive irregularities, prevailed among the students to a lamentable extent. The unfavourable impression thus occasioned in the public mind, far outlasting any reasonable cause in the government of the university, has continued, though with greatly diminished force, to obstruct its advancement even to the present day. The tragical occurrence which several years ago deprived the institution of one of its noblest ornaments, in the person of the learned and pious Professor Davis, though solely chargeable to the unprovoked and reckless passions of a single youth, and entirely unconnected with considerations bearing upon the general discipline, was but too well calculated to extend the yet remaining prejudices caused by its earlier career. Yet it is pleasing to reflect that in spite of this terrible blow, from which not a few predicted that it would never be able to recover, and notwithstanding the depressing effects of the times, felt in our literary institutions as well as elsewhere, its career has since been marked by a steady increase in the number of its students. About 200 youths are now prosecuting their studies in the University, comprising in the academic courses, we believe, about one half of the entire number of young Virginians at present occupied in such pursuits, so that, should no untoward interference cripple its powers, we are justified in expecting within the next few years a larger class than has ever yet been gathered in its halls. As respects the efficient character of its discipline, as now enforced, and the general absence of college vices and irregularities, we are fully authorized in saying that the University is most favourably distinguished in comparison with similar institutions abroad; while we may add, that the general excellence of its regulations is in nothing more strongly marked, than in the earnest activity of a large portion of the students in their literary tasks. Inadequate preparatory training: Along with the adverse influences above referred to, we should not neglect another whose effects in a great degree beyond the control of the institution, though gradually diminishing, must continue for some time to restrain its numbers and its usefulness. We allude to the defective preparatory training of by far the greater number of the youth educated at the ordinary academies and schools in Virginia and the more southern states. This lamentable defect, operating as a check upon the laudable aspirations of many who under other circumstances would be eager to profit by the higher teachings of the university, turns them away from her halls to stifle their cravings at home, or to seek in some other scene more easy access to literary honour, or should they venture into her precincts, without great energy of purpose, sometimes so fills them with discouragement as to divert their ambition to unworthy or pernicious aims. OBJECTIONS TO THE CONTINUANCE OF THE ANNUITY CONSIDEREDâ GENERAL AND ECONOMICAL EXPEDIENCY OF SUSTAINING THE INSTITUTION BY THE CUSTOMARY APPROPRIATION. We have now presented a brief but we trust sufficiently extended view of the intellectual plan of the University, the practical workings of its peculiar methods, and the general influence exerted by it on the public mind. Other and less welcome topics now claim our consideration. We have already alluded to the rather imperfect numerical success which has thus far rewarded its efforts, and indicated several of the causes to which this result is to be ascribed. These injurious influences springing from a misapprehension of the tendencies and an ignorance of the aims of the university, have not been confined in their effects to a mere withholding of students from its halls. Perhaps no literary institution ever established in this country has in the community to which it belongs been so little encouraged amid the difficulties of its earlier career by a just appreciation of its peculiar literary merits, and certainly none has ever been called upon to contend against a stronger array of prejudice and misconception. This fact, seemingly so inconsistent with the sympathy and liberal intelligence characterizing the people of this commonwealth, can only be explained by the extraordinary absence throughout the state of correct information respecting the objects and operations of the institution. Indeed it would seem that its remoteness from the large towns, and the imperfect facilities of intercourse which we as yet possess, as well as the domestic habits incident to the prevailing pursuit of our citizens, have been in no small degree instrumental in perpetuating the misconceptions which have obstructed its progress. Its officers and friends too, from whose stated or occasional publications such needful information was to have been expected, confiding perhaps too implicitly in the sure dissemination of truth, and fastidiously averse to the display of pretensions justly measureable only by their effects, have we think unwisely omitted the appropriate means of correcting the prevailing misconceptions so unfavourable to a just appreciation of the University. Without intending therefore to ascribe to indifference or neglect of duty a silence which has been suggested by the modest dignity of true scholarship, we cannot but believe that had due care been used to disseminate from time to time interesting details relating to the instruction and discipline of the university, prejudice and misconception would long since have vanished, and the pre-eminent merits of the institution would now every where throughout the state be the subject of a patriotic congratulation. So little however is the true character of the University understood in many quarters of the commonwealth, that we hear annually from patriotic and otherwise enlightened persons measures of hostility sustained by an appeal to the strangest errors and misconceptions, measures which we are sure could never have been suggested had some systematic means been adopted by an annual visitation and report of becoming personally informed concerning its plan and operations. As these unfriendly indications in the form in which they have been recently displayed are in the opinion of many the token of possible dangers threatened to the university, and as they must in any event have the effect of confirming distrust and hostility in minds not properly informed, we propose briefly to review the several topics which make up the usual burden of complaint. Of the alleged great expensiveness of Education at the University: One of the objections most commonly urged against the University is the great and unnecessary expense to which its students are subjected. It is true that the cost of an academic education is somewhat larger at this institution than at a number of the colleges, especially in the northwestern and eastern states. But it is surely no necessary inference from this that such an education is purchased at a dearer rate, unless at the same time it can be shown that the extent and thoroughness of the intellectual training at the University does not keep pace with the increased expense. Now among those who are most familiar with the plan and literary administration of these institutions in other states, and who have had opportunities of comparing their course of instruction, as actually conducted, and not as set forth in print, with the extensive system of the University, there is and can be no hesitation in affirming that measured by the just standard of the intrinsic value as well as the cost of education, the University is in reality a cheaper institution than a majority of the colleges in the United States. Looking to the ample and costly apparatus of instruction in operation at the University, through its numerous corps of professors, its extensive library, as well as to the high system of teaching it pursues, and contrasting these with the opportunities of knowledge which are held out by the so-called cheap colleges of the country, it seems to us to be strangely unreasonable to make a small difference of expense in the two cases, the basis of prejudice and complaint. But comparing in this respect our University with Harvard, the only institution in this country with which we think it can in fairness be compared, we find this pretext for objection entirely removed. By an estimate of the usual average of the year's expenses of each student at that distinguished University, it will be seen that the amount is about the same, and probably a little greater there than with us. Besides it should be remembered that collegiate education is necessarily in general more expensive in the southern than the eastern and western states, so that while its cost at the University does not largely exceed that at William and Mary, it is even less than the expense at some of the better institutions in the south and southwest. Of the alleged Aristocratic character of the Institution.âBut this objection of expensiveness to the student is urged sometimes in a different and still more hostile form, tending to foster very injurious prejudices among a large and most important class of citizens. According to this view, the University, though established and now partly supported by the contributions of all, is essentially an aristocratic institution, beneficial exclusively to the comparatively rich, and a tax without an equivalent to the poor. It is indeed true, that as a general rule, those only can avail themselves of its opportunities, whose means enable them to defray the necessary expenses; but it is far from being correct that a large majority of the students are the children of wealthy and so called aristocratic families. Much the greater number are derived from the middle ranks of life, where a moderate competency, husbanded with care, affords the means of completing their education at the University; and not a few belong to that noble class of poor young men who bring with them their well saved earnings as teachers, or in other walks, to exchange for the literary distinction after which they aspire. Instances also occur of indigent students of superior merit receiving gratuitous instruction from the professors, and by a regulation of the faculty, all students preparing for the ministry, are exempted from the usual fees. In view of an extended philanthropy, it would doubtless be desirable that all the youths of the country, competent to profit by the higher kinds of instruction should enjoy the precious advantages of a university education. But it must be remembered that the opportunities of such instruction must from their very nature be expensive, and there is no legerdemain either of individual schemers or legislative bodies by which they can be secured to the poor without being paid for either by a class or by the entire community. While we admit, in common with the friends of liberal knowledge at the University, as well as throughout the state, that important public benefit would arise from any measure, which, without impairing the general usefulness of the institution, would open its halls to a deserving class of students, whom poverty now detains at home, we feel it due to patriotism and truth, strongly to repel the unjust and pernicious sentiment that the humbler portion of our fellow-citizens, though contributors to its support, receive no benefits in return. He must indeed have observed to but little purpose who could deliberately adopt an impression so entirely inconsistent with the obvious workings of the social system of our state and country. Who of experience has not marked the diffusive benefits with which one well trained mind can brighten and bless an extensive neighbourhood? Who has not seen its beneficent activity in promoting the education of the poor by the fostering of good schoolsâincreasing their comfort and prosperity by agricultural improvements, or protecting their rights and soothing their physical sufferings by the skill and learning of the professions; and who does not feel that the best interests of the poor no less than of the rich, resting on the wisdom of the public councils, are therefore dependent upon the large and accurate knowledge of the framers of our laws. As further proof that the poor enjoy an important share in the 6 benefits of the institution, we need only recur to the illustrations previously given of the valuable labours of the alumni, and their well trained pupils, in advancing the education of this portion of the intellect of the commonwealth. PLANS FOR RENDERING THE UNIVERSITY EXTENSIVELY ACCESSIBLE TO THE POOR. In estimating the expenses of a session at the University, it seems to be very commonly imagined that the cost of tuition is a chief item in the account, and that a reduction in the fees paid to the professors would so diminish the amount as to throw wide the doors of the institution to large numbers now unable to attend. The unreasonableness of this view is apparent from the fact that while with the greatest economy the whole expenses of the student could not be brought below three hundred dollars, the cost of tuition would be only seventy-five dollars. Granting, therefore, that there should be an entire omission instead of a reduction of the fees, there would still remain for board, lodging, fuel, books, and other incidental expenses, a sum nearly, if not quite as likely as the entire amount, to exclude the needy student from the halls of the University. But it may be urged that the whole or a part of the annuity paid the University might be diverted from its present objects to the support of such a class of students, and that the institution might still be continued in its wonted activity by the income derived from those who pay. Were such a result likely to ensue, it would doubtless be both wise and patriotic to make so benevolent an appropriation of the public funds. But those who are acquainted with this or any of the higher institutions of learning do not require to be told that far different consequences would follow any important reduction of the resources on which it has been accustomed to depend. It might and probably would be continued for a time, but so crippled in its means and degraded in its organization as to be no longer worthy of the high purposes of its founders. Sinking to the level of the inferior institutions of the land, the University would cease to attract the ambitious students of other States, and vainly pointing to her once gushing fountains of knowledge, now dwindled, and perhaps impure, she would in sadness see the choicest intellects of Virginia seeking in distant haunts those living waters of science which she could no longer proffer to their minds. And granting that surviving this shock, in a long course of years, aided by the returning liberality of the state, she should partially recover from its paralysing effects, the arduous task would recur of moulding her discipline and instructions to new and loftier views before she could resume the station of dignity and usefulness from which she had been cast down, and thus again she would be called to meet the difficulties that attended her early organization. And may we not ask what adequate compensation would the public receive for the relinquishment of those high aims of education which led to her establishment and endowment by the state? The whole of the present annuity of fifteen thousand dollars would not cover the expense of educating and maintaining at the University more than fifty gratuitous students, and this too, supposing that the professors and officers received no salaries, and that the sum was appropriated exclusively to this charitable purpose. But enfeebled and humbled as she would be by the withdrawal of this fund, if indeed she were not wholly prostrated, it cannot be doubted that her numbers would be greatly reduced, her teachings made. meagre and superficial, and that therefore the experiment would result in a serious loss instead of a gain to the education of the state. In this view of the consequences of such an attempt at opening the University to the poor, we would have no hesitation in strongly condemning the experiment as at once destructive of whatever is really valuable in the institution, and injurious to the commonwealth at large. Besides, other and truly effective means for securing this desirable end are, we think, entirely within our reach. Of the various schemes which might be devised, there is one, which, preserving unimpaired the general usefulness and the dignity of the University by leaving the annuity untouched, and requiring no appropriation from the treasury of the state, has been in part suggested by views long entertained by the Faculty of the University. This we may be allowed briefly to indicate as follows: Limiting the operation of the plan, in the beginning at least, to one student from each senatorial district, we would propose that the indigent youth having been prepared for university instruction by the training of the grammar-school and the academy, and having evinced throughout that marked intelligence and industry which would qualify as well as entitle him to a superior education, should be subjected to a preliminary examination by the judges, or such other competent board residing in the district, as the Legislature might authorise. Having thus satisfactorily shown his capacity to profit by the higher teachings of the University, he should then be sent thither and there maintained for a period not longer than two years, at the cost of the district, the fund for this purpose being raised by a levy or such other means as the Legislature might ordain. It should moreover be made the condition on which this precious opportunity was afforded, that each of these beneficiaries of the public be required, after completing his course at the University, to devote himself for a specified time to the business of instruction. Aided by the liberality of the Faculty, who, we are authorised to say, have expressed their willingness to promote such a scheme of benevolence by their gratuitous instruction, the entire charge of maintenance and education, including books, stationery, and clothing, would not much exceed two hundred dollarsâa sum too small to be felt as a tax in any district of the state, and utterly insignificant when weighed against that active and in some cases splendid usefulness to which it would raise a large and precious portion of the intellect of the state. It is not an unimportant part of the effect of such a plan, that while from the members of a normal school thus organised and taught, extensive benefits could not fail to accrue to the public generally, the University itself would be rewarded by the earnest sympathy and good will of that numerous class of our citizens who, from causes beyond its control, are now debarred from its instructions. As a summary of our views on the important subject of affording to the poor opportunities of education at the University, we would then say: First. That the University was founded for the express object, not of educating any particular class, but of furnishing the means of high and thorough intellectual training, and by example and influence of raising the general standard of education through the state; and that while it has most completely attained the former of these ends, it has in spite of obstacles made important steps towards the latter. Secondly. That these ends, deemed by the founders of the institution of the highest interest to the state, are still no less than then, just objects of patriotic solicitude. Thirdly. That these objects must inevitably be defeated by withdrawing from the institution the annuity it has heretofore received, and that the heavy injury thus inflicted upon the interests of education, would not be attended by a gain to the poorer classes in any degree commensurate with the general loss. Fourthly and lastly. That therefore the only effective method of securing to the indigent a large share of the direct advantages of university instruction is, either by an appropriation from the Literary fund for that purpose, or as just described, by district contributions, aided, if desired, by the liberality of the Faculty. In what we have now said, the supposition is implied, that in withholding from the University a part or all of its customary annuity, the object in view was the diversion of the fund to a kindred benevolent and patriotic purpose. To those, if such there be, who would seriously give countenance to this measure on other grounds, who would degrade our University from its honourable pre-eminence, and tear from the escutcheon of the state its brightest literary star, to bestow a few thousand dollars on objects foreign to the sacred uses of education, or to scatter them in pittances to the public schools, we have no argument to present. Let them listen to the pleadings of the aspiring young students around them, who ask that the springs of knowledge for which they thirst, shall be rather widened and deepened than closed up for ever. Let them ponder the motives of the republican sage and patriot, whose wisdom taught him, that in giving to his beloved Virginia the high instructions of the University, he was conferring a benefit in which by diffusive influence every citizen of the commonwealth must share. And finally, let them remember that the glory of the state and her noblest influences abroad must largely depend on the literary training of her sons, and that the pecuniary tribute thus threatened to be withheld, even were this the chief benefit it conferred, would, in the view of the liberal and wise, be but a small price for that honourable distinction in letters which it has already enabled her to achieve. ALLEGED EXTRAVAGANT INCOMES OF THE PROFESSORS. Among the complaints made against the University, we sometimes hear it urged that the incomes of the professors are extravagantly large, and that a regard to republican moderation, as well as a cheapening of the expenses of instruction, require them to be reduced. In the last four sessions, including the one now in progress, the average income of all the professors has been very nearly as follows: In the session of 1841-42, $2,300 In the session of 1842-43, 2,250 In the session of 1843-44, 2,150 In the session of 1844-45, 2,350 It thus appears that the average for the whole period of four sessions, may be set down at twenty-three hundred dollars for each professor. That this sum exceeds the income of the professors in a number of our literary institutions, is undoubtedly true. But it is equally certain that it does not surpass, and in many instances falls short of that of the teachers generally in seminaries of distinguished literary rank. Thus the receipts of those professors who are steadily employed in a full course of duty in Cambridge, in Columbia College, New York, at West Point, in the collegiate department of the University of Pennsylvania, of several of those in Princeton, in the University of South Carolina, and several other institutions in the Southern States, are as great, and in many instances greater, than are received by the professors of our University. And it should be borne in mind, that the comparative cheapness of the means of living, and of the prevailing habits of society, has the effect of bringing the smaller emoluments of the teachers in many of the New England and Western colleges more nearly to an equality with the receipts of those elsewhere who are more liberally paid. It should also be remarked that in many of our institutions the numerous tutors who share the inferior duties of the professors, and thus greatly lighten their toils, divide the emoluments of the department, and thus very properly reduce the incomes of the principal instructors in a ratio somewhat corresponding to the diminution of their labours. At our University, on the contrary, the tasks of tutor and professor fall upon the same individual, and those who are familiar with the daily routine of instruction, especially in some of its schools, well know the unceasing drudgery it involves. Comparing the emoluments at Cambridge and most other prominent institutions with those at the University, as bestowed upon each leading department or school, it will be found that, for the amount of laborious teaching they perform, the professors at the University are less liberally rewarded than their brethren at any of the institutions in view. In a word, the full circle of instruction in any one school or department, is really obtained at much less cost at the University than by their complex system it can be with them. But we turn to another view of the question, comporting, we think, better with right conceptions of the high interest it involves. The qualifications which fit a professor for the duties of any chair at a distinguished seat of science and letters are such as are won only by long years of studious labour, and of abstinence from the pleasing relaxations of society. They are the mingled fruits of genius and perseverance, matured often at the cost of health, and generally by the sacrifice of many a plan of easy self-advancement. They are the gathered treasures wrought with anxious toil from amid the deep labyrinths of thought, to be sent abroad with the impress of truth, as a precious part of the intellectual currency of the world. Are qualifications thus rare, difficult of attainment, and valuable in application, to be estimated as but of little price? Compared with the easy training which prepares men for the ordinary vocations of life, they are surely worthy of at least an equal remuneration. Besides, we should remember the toil and confinement of the professor, as well in his closet as in the presence of his class, in forming our estimate of the value of his services. Yet, with all his hard-earned acquirements in science and letters, and his daily exhausting labours of instruction and discipline, his emoluments at the University, thus alleged to be extravagant, will scarcely vie with those of the middle class of lawyers, physicians, and merchants in any of the thriving communities of our country. The cultivators of letters and science, eminently social in their activity, and especially so in modern times, naturally seek the incentives and rewards of their efforts in the wide circle of emulous spirits gathered in the larger cities. Nor can we expect that small pecuniary inducements will suffice to tempt the really worthy of their number to exchange such congenial scenes for the isolation of a professor's chair, even though it be one in our honoured University. Even the more liberal compensation formerly given has proved, as is well known, insufficient in some instances to secure the services of distinguished scholars invited to its halls, and has not prevented the resignation of many professors who had for a time filled its stations with undenied success. To stint their emoluments then would be at once to exclude from its chairs the commanding abilities and attainments necessary to accomplish the high ends for which it was established, to paralyze the living spirit of its organization, and to degrade this noble institution into a cumbrous machine for class-book recitations and superficial, though it might be plausible, academic routine. ENDOWMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY AS COMPARED WITH OTHER INSTITUTIONS OF LIKE RANK. In claiming from the commonwealth a continuance of the pecuniary help heretofore accorded to her, the University only asks, in behalf of the great interests of education, for that just and reasonable support which is essential to the discharge of her peculiar functions in the intellectual training of the youth of the state. If this higher and more thorough training be really as important to the welfare and honour of the community, as the wise and patriotic of our own and other countries have uniformly maintained, then Virginia cannot without grave injury to her interests and her reputation, dispense with such an institution as her university. It only remains to be considered at what rate, compared with other communities, she purchases these precious advantages. On this point we do not hesitate to say, that adverting to the great comprehensiveness of the scheme of actual instruction in the University, and comparing her income with that of other prominent institutions sustained either by public liberality or private munificence, her annuity of 15,000 dollars cannot be regarded as more than a merely moderate endowment. The most richly endowed universities of this country cannot be compared in their resources with the long established institutions of Europe. Cambridge and Oxford in England, and the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, are possessed of incomes the accumulated growth of ages, which vie with the revenues of some of the most opulent states of the Union, and which far exceed the aggregate income of all the universities and colleges in our land. Many of the German universities have resources almost equally extensive, and there is probably not one of them of reputation, whose means do not exceed that of any university or college in the United States. In most of them the professors and other officers, forming a very numerous corps, receive their salaries directly from government, and are regarded as a part of the official organization of the state. Referring to the institutions of our own state, we find Willam and Mary and Washington colleges, each provided with a permanent fund, yielding an income which, considering the scale of operations in the two cases, is as large if not larger than that of the University. The University of South Carolina, endowed by the state, and formerly entitled to an annuity of about 12,000 dollars, is, we believe, at present receiving the same or a greater sum from the public treasury. Two of the collegiate institutions in Louisiana have been sustained by an annuity of 15,000 dollars each, and the University of Alabama is supported we believe by a still ampler contributionâwhile several of the institutions of the northwestern states, richly provided for by grants of lands, are beginning to receive or already enjoying valuable and daily augmenting resources. The permanent income of Columbia College, New York, is, we understand, but little if at all inferior to that of our university, while the revenue of Harvard, the institution most justly comparable with ours, is not much short of 60,000 dollars. With these facts in view, the annuity of 15,000 dollars, instead of appearing wastefully large, cannot fail to be regarded as but a very moderate contribution in behalf of the high literary interests deveolved upon the University. Indeed, considering the expansive scheme of its instructions, and the substantial literary merits which have given it so distinguished a place among the higher seminaries of our country, this annual provision might justly be viewed as a comparatively meagre endowment, which, though large enough perhaps for the present literary wants of our community, may hereafter be augmented with great benefit to the commonwealth. It may perhaps be objected, that as the fixed revenue of Harvard, and some other institutions above mentioned, is derived from the munificence of individual benefactors, and therefore makes no call upon the treasury of the state, it is unfair to adduce the example of these seats of learning in support of the claims of the University. But our argument of course supposes that an institution such as the University is demanded by the highest interests as well as the reputation of the commonwealth, and we have referred to these other distinguished seminaries only for the purpose of showing at what general cost such an institution can be maintained. At the establishment of the University, the hope was no doubt indulged, that sooner or later it also would become an object of private benefaction; but we have not the slightest ground for supposing that in the patriotic aspirations of its founders, these private endowments, should they accrue, were ever looked to as a means of withdrawing the university from legislative control, by dispensing with the annual bounty of the state. It would on some accounts certainly be desirable, were our University like Harvard and several others, sustained entirely or in great part by funds derived from the munificence of individuals. But it should not be forgotten, that while by this means the public would be relieved from the annual contribution now required, the general interests of the community as affected by the operations of the institution would be either wholly neglected or but partially secured The entire government and organization devolving upon self-elective boards of trustees, irresponsible to the state, would of necessity be exposed to the narrowing influences springing from the predilections and prejudices of religious sects and classes of society; and the University, by an easy transition, losing the liberal features of a school suited equally to all, would become the property and the spoiled favourite of a particular denomination or rank. PURELY ECONOMICAL CONSIDERATIONS. Viewed in a purely economical aspect, the consequences of withholding the annuity must suggest considerations strongly adverse to the measure. For, supposing the University still to linger on, it is certain, as before remarked, that it would cease to draw students from abroad, while it would drive to the seminaries of other states a large number of those who now seek their education at home. Estimating these effects, on the smallest scale consistent with probability, we should thus lose the pecuniary benefit of some fifty students from other states, and seventy-five of our own, who would be sent abroad, making an aggregate of money withdrawn from the circulation of the state of about 50 or 60,000 dollars; while assuming the entire prostration of the university, a result not unlikely to follow, the sum thus virtually withdrawn could not fall short of 100,000 dollars. Another and weighty consideration of the same class must at once suggest itself, on reverting to the large amount of capital which in the form of buildings and other necessary means has been provided by the state and by the institution itself, and which would be rendered in great part if not entirely useless. This sum enbracing the successive additions and improvements made to the buildings and grounds of the university, since the first year of its operation, as well as the original outlay of the state, may be estimated at upwards of 300,000 dollars. But important as these economical effects would unquestionably be, they are of a nature to awaken in the minds of those who duly appreciate the value of the University as a public institution, but little interest compared with the momentous evils, moral as well as intellectual, of such a measure. Among the high incentives which animated the zeal of its founders in laying their plan of the institution, there was none more marked by genuine wisdom, than the desire of cherishing in our youth, a lofty patriotism and state pride, by providing a means for their highest intellectual training within the commonwealth itself. The daily associations of home and country blending happily with the lessons of literature and science, and kindling in the student's mind, a warm, but enlightened devotion to his state, were in the view of these great public benefactors, an object worthy of being fostered even with expensive care. We need not trace the reverse of the pleasing picture, since all can feel how patriotism must dwindle beneath the uncongenial influences of an education obtained abroad, and few we think would be inclined lightly to regard results fraught with so grave an injury to the political and intellectual character of the commonwealth.</field>
