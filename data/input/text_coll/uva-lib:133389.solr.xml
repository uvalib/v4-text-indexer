      <field name="fulltext">ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS For admission to any department of the University, the general conditions are the following: 1. Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years. 2. Good Character.âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation.âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the academic requirements for admission. For admission to the College of Arts and Sciences, the candidate must present a certificate or pass an equivalent examination. In either case the amount of preparation required is measured in terms of units: A unit represents a year's study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year's work. This definition of a unit takes the four-year high-school course as a basis and assumes that the length of the school year is from thirty-six to forty weeks, that a period is from forty to sixty minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year's work in any subject cannot be accomplished in less than one hundred and twenty hours, or their equivalent. ADMISSION BY CERTIFICATE For admission by certificate from a secondary school the applicant should file with the Dean a certificate of preparation, made out on a blank form furnished by the University. This certificate must come from an accredited public high school or from an accredited private secondary school. For admission from an institution of collegiate rank, an official transcript of the applicant's record, made out on the form used by the institution in question, must be submitted. In addition, each applicant, whether from a secondary school or a college, should submit a formal application for admission, on a blank form supplied by the University. The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a full graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a full graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory secondary school work of standard grade, covering at least 15 entrance units. Certificate credit for any unit is invalidated by failure in a college entrance examination on the unit in question in the year admission is desired, unless the applicant ranked in the highest quarter of his class. An applicant for admission who ranked in the lowest quarter of his class, or who failed on more than two subjects in secondary school, will not be admitted unless he presents positive evidence that he is likely to succeed in college in spite of his secondary school record. An applicant for admission from outside of Virginia may be required to supplement his application by an interview with a representative of the University. In every case the applicant must have a general character recommendation from the principal of his school, and personality and promise, as well as scholarly attainment, will be considered in determining admission. The University accredits all four-year public high schools and all private secondary schools which are fully accredited by the State Board of Education of Virginia. Schools outside of Virginia which are fully accredited by their own state universities or institutions of equal rank, by their own state departments of education or by recognized regional associations of secondary schools, are also accredited by the University. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases pass the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in September, according to the dates given in the Schedule of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the Honor System, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge, and they are held only on the dates given in the Schedule. A fee of one dollar is charged for each examination taken. This fee is payable in advance and is in no case returned. In order to take the examinations it is only necessary for the candidate to register for them at the Dean's Office, after his arrival here. The entrance examinations of the University are similar, in many respects, to those of the College Entrance Examination Board. The University does not furnish sample copies of its entrance examinations. Official records of the examinations of the College Entrance Examination Board or of the University of the State of New York may be submitted in lieu of taking entrance examinations here.

Thursday Spanish 2: Two years 9:00 a. m. Wednesday Spanish 3: Third year 11:00 a. m. Wednesday Spanish 4: Fourth year 2:30 p. m. Wednesday Admission from Secondary School as a Regular Student.âFor admission to the College of Arts and Sciences as a regular student, the candidate must possess an amount of preparation which is at least the equivalent of that represented by four years of successful work in an accredited school. He must offer, either by certificate or by examination, 15 units, of which 3 must be in English and 2Â½ in Mathematics (1Â½ in Algebra, 1 in Plane Geometry). The remaining 9Â½ units may be selected at will, but no credit will be given for less than 2 units in any foreign language, and credit will not be given for more than 4 vocational units. Admission from Other Colleges.âAn applicant for admission to the College of this University from an institution of collegiate rank may be admitted upon presentation of a satisfactory transcript of his record at his former college. No student suspended from another college for scholastic deficiency or on probation in another college for scholastic deficiency will be admitted to the College of this University in the immediately succeeding session, unless he passes at least one year-course, or the equivalent, in one term of the Summer Quarter of this University. No student from another college will be admitted to the College of this University if he has ever been suspended or on probation more than once, or if he has ever been both on probation and suspended. Credit for Work Done in Other Colleges.âCredit toward a degree may be allowed for work completed in another college upon presentation of a satisfactory transcript of record. In no case will credit be given for more than fifteen courses completed elsewhere. (See definition of a course under Requirements for Degrees.) A maximum credit for five courses may be granted for one year of work in another college, and a credit of eleven courses for two years. The final validation of credit granted on transcript of record is effected by the successful completion of not less than four courses during the candidate's first session here. In every case, the last session of candidacy for a degree, which must be a regular session of nine months or three full summer quarters, must be spent exclusively in college work in this University; and all courses offered in a Field of Concentration for the Bachelor of Arts or cultural Bachelor of Science degrees must be completed in residence in this University. In general, credit will not be granted for work completed elsewhere with the lowest passing grade, if the grades are given as letters, or with a grade below 75 per cent, if the grades are given as percentages, unless the student passes an advanced course in the same subject here. Conditioned Students.âA candidate for admission must offer 15 acceptable entrance units. A student who, while able to offer 15 units, cannot offer second-year (intermediate) algebra or plane geometry, may be admitted with a condition in either or both of these subjects. An entrance condition should be absolved before the beginning of the session following initial registration. This may be done by passing entrance examinations or by summer work. A student with an entrance condition should not attempt to study mathematics here, and no conditioned student may be awarded a degree until his condition is absolved. Special Students.âA candidate may be admitted as a special student without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided that, if he is a Virginian, he is more than twenty years old, or, if he is not a Virginian, he is more than twenty-three years old, on the day of registration, and gives adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up their deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the Summer Quarter. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. An applicant who has regularly attended a secondary school until he is twenty years of age without, because of failure, obtaining credit for 15 acceptable entrance units, will not be admitted as a special student. Admission of Women.âWomen are admitted as candidates for the vocational degrees of Bachelor of Science in Architecture, Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and Bachelor of Science in Commerce. They are not admitted as candidates for the B.A. or cultural B.S. degrees, as pre-professional students, or as special students. In order to be admitted as a candidate for a vocational degree, an applicant must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present a certificate showing graduation from an accredited public high school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private school, with credit for not less than 15 college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for 15 entrance units, of at least ten courses (30 session-hours or 60 semester-hours) of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. Admission during the Session.âNo applicant for admission to the College of Arts and Sciences will be admitted after the second week of lectures, unless the Committee on Admissions is satisfied that, in view of his record, he is likely to prove successful with the work undertaken in spite of the handicap of late entrance. A few students, of exceptional preparation and ability, may be admitted at the beginning of the second term, January 4. No students are admitted in February.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">GENERAL REGULATIONS REGISTRATION Registration.âApplicants seeking admission to the University should present themselves to the Deans of their respective Departments at some time during the first three days of the session. Delayed Registration.âAny student who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will not be admitted unless he can explain his delay in a manner satisfactory to the Dean and will be charged a delayed registration fee. Registration after the Christmas Recess and the March Examination Period.âAfter the Christmas Recess and the March examination period, every student is required to register by attending the first meeting of each clss and laboratory section for which he is enrolled. No further formality is necessary. Any student failing to register thus will be required to pay the delayed registration fee, and will be liable to penalties imposed for unexcused absences. But if the delay is due to illness or other providential cause the Dean is authorized to remit the fee. RESIDENCE AND ATTENDANCE The Academic Year begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September and continues for thirty-nine weeks. Thanksgiving Day and Jefferson Day are holidays, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the last week-day before the twenty-third of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of holidays, unless he receives permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before the close of the session. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises in the courses which he pursues, or else suffer such penalties as may be imposed for unexcused absences. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the Department in which the student is registered. For the conditions governing the return of fees upon withdrawal, see page 19. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the several departmental faculties for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also the regulations as to delinquent students in the various departments. Absence from Examinations.âWritten examinations are an essential part of the work of every course in the University, and attendance upon them is required of every student. Absence may be excused only on the ground of sickness on the day of examination (attested by a physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause which may be approved by the several faculties of the University. Special Examinations are granted only upon prompt application therefor, and in case the applicant's absence from the regular examination has been excused. See the preceding paragraph. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System, and an unpledged paper is counted a total failure. In matters of class standing as well, students are expected to regard themselves as governed by the law of honor. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. CONDUCT Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or anywhere else. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. The President will dismiss from the University every student convicted of public drunkenness, or of other conduct reflecting serious discredit upon the University. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objection to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The publication or sale of anonymous publications is forbidden. Motor driven vehicles either owned or operated by students are prohibited from parking in the roadways or elsewhere on the University grounds between the hours of 9:00 a. m. and 3:30 p. m. At no time may they park in the alleys, near fire hydrants, or on curves. However, students suffering from serious physical disability may be granted permits to park. MEDICAL ATTENDANCE Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, treatment of the eye, ear, nose and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right of medical attendance. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. EXPENSES Payment of Fees.âWhen the aggregate charge for University fee, tuition fee, laboratory fees and room rent does not exceed $50 for the session, the total amount shall be paid upon registration. If said fees aggregate more than $50, but do not exceed $100, one-half thereof shall be paid upon registration and the remainder at the beginning of the second term. When the fees aggregate more than $100, payment shall be made one-third upon registration; one-third at the opening of the second term and the remainder at the opening of the third term. If any payment remain unpaid for fifteen days after the date on which it is due, the Bursar shall immediately notify the Dean of the Department in which such student is entered of the delinquency, and such student shall by him be required at once to cease attending lectures, using laboratories, library, gymnasium, athletic grounds or buildings, boarding at the dining hall, and making use of any other privileges as a student until his financial relations with the University have been arranged satisfactorily with the Bursar. Return of Fees.âA student withdrawing within five days after registering shall have his fees refunded in full, except the sum of $5 to cover cost of registration, and his name shall be stricken from the rolls. If he withdraw or is dropped from the rolls for any cause after the fifth day of the term and before the middle thereof, his fees shall be returned pro rata. If he withdraw or be dropped from the rolls for any cause after the middle of any term no refund shall be made for that term, except in case of sickness when the refund shall be pro-rated upon certificate of the University Physician or other reputable medical practitioner. In any case a minimum charge of $5 shall be made to cover cost of registration. Laboratory fees shall be refunded upon statement of professor in charge except where the withdrawal is within five days after registering. Regulation Concerning Registration as Virginia Student.âIn order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; or if he has attained his majority, that he himself be domiciled in said State; and that either his parents or the applicant for admission shall have been bona fide taxpayers in the State of Virginia for at least two years prior to said application. Sons of Regular Officers of the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, or Public Health Service, whether on the active or retired list, irrespective of the location of their posts of duty, are accorded the privilege of registering under the rules applicable to the registration of Virginia students. Superintendents and Teachers of Public Schools Exempt from Fees.â White male teachers and superintendents of the public schools of Virginia will be admitted, during the last three months of the session, to the Academic Schools of the University without payment of fees (except those charged in laboratory courses), upon presentation of certificates that they have been teachers in the public schools of the State during the year. Applicants for admission as teachers are required to send in their names to the President of the University not later than March 5. Ministers of Religion and Candidates for the Ministry.âMinisters of religion may attend any of the Academic Schools of the University without payment of the tuition fee. The same privilege will be extended to any young man who submits testimonials that he is an approved candidate for the ministry, and unable to meet without aid the expenses of an education. UNIVERSITY CHARGES** ** These charges are for three or more courses. For one course the student will pay one-third, and for two courses, one-half of the University fee and tuition, for the session. University and Tuition Fees* * The University fee goes to the fund intended to defray the general expenses of the University. Payment of this fee entitles the student, without additional charge, to the use of the library; to the privileges of the gymnasium, with baths, etc. (but not private lockers), and the advice and aid of the physical training staff, and to free medical attendance by the University Physician in case of illness. It also covers all regular examination and diploma fees. College students from Virginia taking a single technical course in the Department of Engineering pay a tuition of $60, or $20 per term. The College: VIRGINIANS NON-VIRGINIANS University fee, all students $ 50.00 $ 60.00 Tuition, Academic students 60.00 250.00 â  â  Candidates for B.S. in Architecture, after the first year, are registered as professional students in Architecture.

APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF NECESSARY EXPENSES The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here University, tuition, athletic and Topics fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. For each department three estimates are givenâa low, an average, and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundryâin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the estimate.

Opportunities for employment are not infrequent, but no new student should attempt to attend the University unless he has sufficient private resources to defray at least half of the expenses of his first session. After a student has arrived at the University, the Bureau will make every effort to find suitable work for him, but no assurance of employment can be given until after the student's arrival. Students who desire the assistance of the Bureau are invited to apply for information by addressing the Director, Box 1487, University, Virginia. Loans will be provided for deserving students. See page 38. BOARD AND LODGING Dormitories.âStudents may reside in the University dormitories, in their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. The President will withdraw from the approved list any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. The Halls are reserved for first-year college and engineering students from high schools or preparatory schools who are required to live in them unless excused for special reasons by the Dean of the University. Supervision is provided by Counselors living in each unit of the Halls. These Counselors are responsible to the Dean for maintenance of order and the enforcement of University regulations, and are prepared to be of assistance to the occupants in an advisory capacity. For rules governing the rental and occupancy of University dormitories, and the rates charged for the same, see below. For list of private lodging houses, with rates, apply to Bursar. The University Dormitories The dormitories of the University of Virginia consist of The Halls, East Lawn and West Lawn, East Range and West Range, Dawson's Row, and Randall Building. Hot water heat and electric light are furnished throughout the dormitories. Each occupant of a dormitory room must provide a pillow, pillow cases, single sheets, blankets, towels, etc., and whatever rugs, curtains, etc., he may desire. Description and Rates The Halls.âThe most comfortable, best-equipped, and most modern rooming accommodations in the University or in the city are to be found in the new University dormitories, erected in 1929. This group of eight buildings stands on the crest of the slope west of Monroe Hill, with an outlook on the Ragged Mountains and the range of the Blue Ridge, and is within less than three minutes walking distance from the gymnasium, the academic, engineering and law class-rooms, and the University Commons. These eight buildings are divided into twelve separate units, known as Halls, each with its individual entrance, and each bearing the name of some professor, distinguished in the history of the University. The buildings are of three stories and of full fire-proof brick and cement construction throughout. They provide one hundred and fifty-three two-room apartments, of living-room and bedroom, each apartment intended to accommodate two students. All of the rooms are approximately fifteen feet square. Each living-room has an open fire-place and is furnished with a desk with drawers, a table with drawer, a steel waste-basket, two rocking-chairs, two straight chairs and floor-plugs for reading lamps. Each bedroom has two large built-in clothes closets, and is furnished with two single beds, two chiffoniers, and two straight chairs. All furniture is new, of excellent quality and attractive design, the bed-springs and mattresses of especially high grade. There is an average of one bathroom to every five students. The bathrooms, each equipped with showers and an individual built-in steel locker and a medicine chest with mirror for each student using it, are so placed that every bedroom, with one sole exception, opens directly into a bath. Telephone service is provided in each Hall. Trunks and packing cases will not be permitted in the apartments of The Halls dormitories. They must be delivered to the trunk room in each Hall from which the student will remove the contents to his room. Trunks and packing cases will be stored in dry racks located in the basement. Each apartment will ordinarily be occupied by two students. The rental for the nine months of the regular session is $125 per student (or $250 for each apartment). East Lawn and West Lawn are of one-story brick construction. They contain thirty-eight rooms, each approximately twelve feet square, located between the pavilions and opening into colonnades running the entire length of "The Lawn."

      <field name="fulltext">STUDENT ACTIVITIES JEFFERSON SOCIETY Connected with the University is the Jefferson Society founded in 1825 to provide for common improvement in debate, to promote general culture among its members and the student body, and to drill its members in all those exercises which strengthen for the free duties of citizenship. All students in regular attendance upon one or more of the schools of the University of Virginia who are not members of any similar organization in this institution shall be eligible to regular membership. Such candidates shall make written applications on forms provided by the Membership Committee. These forms may be obtained at any of the literary meetings of the Society, all of which are open to the public. They are announced in College Topics. PUBLICATIONS College Topics is a tri-weekly newspaper published by the students and devoted to the interests of the University at large. Corks and Curls is the University Annual, its aim being to present some record of the scholastic, religious, athletic and social activities of the college year. Its publication is in the hands of a chartered corporation formed by the fraternities and literary societies of the University. The Virginia Law Review is a journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence published monthly from October to May, inclusive, by the students of the Law Department. The University of Virginia Magazine is a literary journal published seven times a year by students and is sponsored by the Jefferson Society. STUDENT UNION The Student Union was organized in 1932. The University has taken over Madison Hall for use as a center of student activities under the supervision of the Union of which all students are considered members.

In the reading room are newspapers from many of the cities in the South and East. Recreation rooms are also provided. Offices of College Topics, the Magazine, Corks and Curls, the Dulaney Memorial Library and the Student Self Help Bureau are located in the building.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ATHLETICS It is the objective of the University to offer every student an opportunity to engage in sports according to individual interest and ability. Many intramural activities are supported enthusiastically by students who find therein stimulating contacts, exercise, and associations that might otherwise be denied them. The University is represented in intercollegiate athletics by both varsity and first-year teams in football, baseball, basketball, track, boxing, tennis, golf and swimming. Its athletic plant is one of the finest in the South. Memorial Gymnasium contains three basketball courts, a swimming pool, a running track, boxing and wrestling rooms, and adequate locker facilities, in addition to equipment necessary to gymnastic training. Scott Stadium, which seats 22,000 spectators, is considered one of the most beautiful in the country. Lambeth Field has excellent facilities for baseball and track. Twenty-two tennis courts and four intramural fields are located near Memorial Gymnasium. All intercollegiate athletics, physical education activities, and intramural sports are under the supervision of the Director of Athetics and Physical Education, who is responsible under the President for the administration of the entire sports program of the University. An Athletic Council (the 3-3-3) composed of three faculty representatives, three representatives of the Alumni Association, and three student representatives, serves in an official advisory capacity in the administration of athletics. At least four meetings of this Council are held each year.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RELIGIOUS WORK YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, INCORPORATED William Norris Leonard President Paschal Dupuy Fowlkes Vice-President Page Bowie Clagett Recording Secretary Elmer Irving Carruthers Treasurer William Kyle Smith General Secretary William Royall Smithey Chairman, Board of Directors History.âThe Young Men's Christian Association of the University of Virginia which has its headquarters on the second floor of Madison Hall was founded October 12, 1858, during the period of the University's expansion and reformation. Bruce, in his "History of the University of Virginia," states: "The spirit of reformation was expressed in (1) the abolition of the uniform law, and also the law that required the students to leave their beds at dawn; (2) the adoption of the Honor System; (3) and the organization of the Young Men's Christian Association." It was the first college to adopt the constitution of the Y. M. C. A., and thus has the honor of being the oldest college association in the world. Object.âThe object of this Association, as set forth generally in the Charter, is more specifically stated as follows:â to foster and promote Christian fellowship among the students of the University of Virginia by encouraging their participation in religious activities; by provoking their serious thought on great moral and religious issues; by inculcating in them the spirit of service; and by providing for them, and increasing their appreciation of, social entertainment of a wholesome and beneficial nature. Work.âThe Association affords opportunity for voluntary study of the Bible and also of problems of national and international interest, particularly with reference to the possibility of solution by the fundamental principles of Christianity. Discussion groups are addressed by prominent men and faculty members conduct regularly increasing numbers of special groups as interests are developed. Members of the Association work with the Boy Scout troops and cooperate with community agencies in other forms of welfare work. Under the Deputation Committee, student leaders and groups of students visit various preparatory and high schools in the State to conduct religious meetings, and they also carry on evangelistic campaigns in various communities throughout the State. Handbooks and student directories to the number of more than 2,000 are distributed each fall. Various conferences are attended by delegated representatives from the Association both in the State and outside when possible. Equipment.âThrough the munificence of Mrs. William E. Dodge and family, of New York City, the Association possesses a very handsome building, which was erected in 1905, at a cost, including furnishings, of about $80,000, and which is maintained in part by an endowment of over $16,000, subscribed by students, alumni, and friends of the University. This building, called "Madison Hall" in honor of President Madison, who was intimately connected with the early history of the University, faces the north front of the Rotunda. The budget for the support of the Association work is supplied by the income from a small endowment, the Chapel fund and rents. THE UNIVERSITY CHAPEL The handsome Gothic chapel was erected upon the University grounds by the voluntary gifts of students, alumni, members of the faculty and other friends.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">COLLEGE REGULATIONS (1) Definition of a Course.âAn academic course is the work covered in an organized, scheduled class, meeting at least three hours a week throughout the session. Beginners' courses in foreign languages and certain first-year courses in mathematics may meet four or five hours weekly. Science courses with three hours of class work and six hours of laboratory work weekly are designated double-courses and are counted as two courses. (2) Maximum and Minimum Number of Courses to be Carried.âEach College student is required to carry five academic courses except under the conditions stated below: 1. A student on probation may carry only four courses. 2. Special permission to carry a reduced number of courses may be granted by the Dean for adequate reason, such as outside remunerative work, ill health, etc. 3. A student who has passed all of his courses in any term may carry an additional course in the succeeding term. 4. A student may carry an additional course if he is in his graduating year and needs for his degree only one course in excess of the number for which he is otherwise eligible. (3) Grade.âThe grade of a college student in any course, either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercise) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. For passing in any course in the college a grade of 75 per cent. is required. (4) Exclusion from Courses, Probation and Suspension: (I) Exclusion from Courses: 1. A student who is evidently making no real progress in a course, may, at any time during the session, be excluded from the course by the Dean upon recommendation of the instructor concerned. 2. A student whose term grade in a course is less than 50 per cent., or who discontinues the course without permission of the Dean, or who is absent without excuse from the term examination, will be excluded from the course. (II) Probation and Suspension: 1. Probation is a state of warning, involving withdrawal from the student of certain privileges enumerated below. Suspension means enforced withdrawal from the College. 2. A student will be placed on probation if, in any term, he does not pass at least two courses, and, if he shall be excluded from a course or courses, he must, in order to avoid probation, pass at least two courses in excess of the number from which he is excluded. A student will be suspended if, in any term, he does not pass at least one course, and, if he shall be excluded from a course or courses, he must, in order to escape suspension, pass at least one course in excess of the number from which he is excluded. 3. A student on probation must carry at least four courses or be suspended. A student not on probation must carry at least five courses or be placed on probation. (But see (2) above.) 4. No student may remain on probation for more than two terms in his entire college course. If his record is such as to invoke probation a third time, he will be suspended. No student suspended a second time may reenter the College. 5. No student on probation may be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as an athletic team, a musical club or a student publication. 6. Suspension, if imposed during the session, applies to the remainder of the regular session; if imposed at the end of the session, it applies to the whole of the subsequent session. 7. Probation or suspension may be absolved by the passing of one year-course, or the equivalent, in one term of the Summer Quarter. 8. A student who is permitted to withdraw from the University during the session will be re-admitted only on probation if, at the time of his withdrawal, he was on probation. A student previously suspended will be readmitted only on probation. 9. The application of these regulations is automatic. A student may, however, appeal in writing to the Committee on Rules and Courses for relief from their application. The Committee will not accept remediable defects of vision or outside remunerative work as excuses for failure. A student is expected to have visual defects corrected, and, if much outside work is done, to carry a reduced schedule of courses. (5) Absence from Examinations will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination attested by a physician's certificate or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. A student excused from more than one-half of his term examinations on account of illness may not be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as an athletic team, a musical club, or a student publication, until he has taken his examinations. No student may remain in the College if he misses all the examinations of two consecutive terms on account of illness. (6) Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, in accordance with (5) above, is entitled to a special examination on a date during the regular session to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge of the examination. (7) Re-Examinations.âA student who fails on the Final Comprehensive Examination for his degree may take a re-examination at the end of the succeeding session, on recommendation of the Academic School concerned, without further class attendance. Only one re-examination is permitted unless the student attends the University for a full session after his failure. There are no re-examinations on the work of separate courses. (8) Reports.âReports are sent at the end of each term to the parent or guardian of each College student. In addition to the above, a report on the standing of each first-year student in the College is sent to the student's parent or guardian early in November. (9) Voluntary Withdrawal.âVoluntary withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean, as well as the consent of the student's parent or guardian, if he is a minor. Any student who withdraws without permission will be recorded as having been suspended. A student who withdraws immediately before an examination period, except for providential reasons, is not permitted to re-enter the University for the succeeding term. (10) Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also Suspension, above. (11) Change of Studies.âNo change can be made in a student's program of studies except with the written consent of the Dean, together with official notification by the Registrar. No permit for change of courses will be issued after the end of the first week of each term. Any student who drops a course without permission will receive a grade of zero in that course; and no credit may be received for any portion of a course attended before formal permission has been granted as outlined above. (12) Absence from Lectures may be excused by the Dean, but only for sickness or other imperative cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made in writing to the Dean within one week after the absence. But no excuse for an absence may be submitted after the beginning of an examination period. Any student not on probation is allowed 2 absences without penalty each term in each course, and a student who passed, in the preceding term, on all courses taken, aggregating not less than five, is allowed 4 absences without penalty each term in each course. But the performance of written work and laboratory work is not affected by the allowance of absences without penalty. Each unexcused absence (in excess of absences without penalty) from a class exercise in any term will cause one point to be deducted from the student's term grade. A total of more than 10 unexcused absences (in excess of absences without penalty) in any term will cause a student to be placed on probation. Probation imposed for absences is called "attendance probation," and it carries the penalties of probation imposed for failure in courses. If a student incurs attendance probation while on probation for failure in courses he will be suspended. No student who was, for any reason, absent from more than 50 per cent. of the lectures of a course in any term can receive a grade on the course in that term. This regulation does not apply to students on the Dean's List or to holders of Intermediate Honors. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of athletic teams are found in the General Catalogue. The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. (13) The Dean's List.âAny student who passed, in the preceding term, on all courses taken, aggregating not less than five, with an average grade on all courses of at least 85 per cent., will be placed on the Dean's List. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting absence from classes, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone. But the performance of written work and laboratory work is not affected by these regulations. (14) Physical Education Requirement.âAll first-year and second-year students in the College of Arts and Sciences, except professional students of Architecture, are required to take the course in Physical Education unless excused on a physician's certificate. (15) Schedule of Qualifying Examinations.â(See Requirements for Degrees.) The examinations will be held at 2:30 p. m., on the days indicated, in the first week of lectures. English A1: Monday and TuesdayâRoom 11, Cabell Hall. Mathematics A: Trigonometry, Monday; Analytical Geometry, Tuesdayâ Room 11, Mechanical Laboratory. French A2: WednesdayâOffice, Romance Pavilion. German A2: WednesdayâRoom 2, Minor Hall. Greek A2: ThursdayâRoom 103, Cabell Hall. Italian A2: ThursdayâOffice, Romance Pavilion.

      <field name="fulltext">REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES Full opportunity is given to any student to carry out any definite plan of work which he may have in view on coming to the Univedsity, or which may have been prescribed for him by those under whose direction he is completing his education. But when no well-considered plan has been outlined in advance, and the end in view is that for which the great majority of students should enter college, namely, the attainment of a liberal education, the student will be expected to enter upon regular work of the college leading to a baccalaureate degree. Five degrees are offered candidates for graduation in the College of Arts and Sciences. Two of these, the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science, are cultural; the Bachelor of Science in Architecture, the Bachelor of Science in Chemistry, and the Bachelor of Science in Commerce, are vocational degrees, designed for those who wish to fit themselves especially for professional work. No course offered by a successful candidate for one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees can be offered by the same candidate as part of the work credited toward the other cultural baccalaureate degree, nor can any course which has been counted as credit toward a vocational degree be subsequently counted as credit toward a cultural degree; and no work done to remove an entrance condition can be counted for any degree. The normal time required for obtaining a baccalaureate degree is four years, assuming that the student completes each year courses which aggregate the regular minimum of five. A student may, however, materially shorten the time required for obtaining a degree by taking courses in the Summer Quarter for which college credit is given. For credit for work done at other colleges, see page 15. The requirements for the cultural baccalaureate degrees are such as to allow a large measure of freedom of election on the part of the individual student, such restriction only being placed upon this liberty as is necessary to insure at the same time the thoroughness and the breadth of culture for which these degrees stand. In order to secure to the recipient of a degree a due measure of acquaintance with the methods of thought characteristic of each of the leading departments of knowledge, as well as with their subject matter, his courses must be chosen subject to the specific requirements detailed below. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS Degree requirements are stated in terms of courses. An academic course is the work covered in an organized, scheduled class, meeting at least three hours a week throughout the session. Beginners' courses in foreign languages and certain first-year courses in mathematics may meet four or five hours weekly. Science courses with three hours of class work and six hours of laboratory work weekly are designated double-courses and are counted as two courses. For graduation from the College of Arts and Sciences the candidate must have taken and passed a total of twenty courses, completed in conformity with the regulations prescribed for the several degrees. Exemption from certain Required Courses may be obtained as set forth below. Such exemption increases the student's freedom of election, but does not reduce the total number of courses (20) required for a degree. Qualifying examinations are scheduled at the beginning of the session, and no such examination may be taken more than once. BACHELOR OF ARTS AND BACHELOR OF SCIENCE The candidate must complete a total of twenty courses, chosen in accordance with the following regulations: I. Required Courses The eight courses prescribed below must be completed at least one year before graduation. Not less than six of them must be completed at least two years before graduation. English: English A1. Students passing a qualifying examination on English A1 will be exempted from further requirement in English. Foreign Languages: A first-year college course (A1) and a second-year college course (A2) in each of two foreign languages. A candidate for the degree of Bachelor of Arts must offer two courses in Greek or Latin. A candidate for the degree of Bachelor of Science must offer two courses in French or German. A student who presents admission credit for two units of German, Greek or Latin, or for three units of French, Italian or Spanish, must enter the A2 course if he wishes to study the language in question. If he passes the A2 course he will be exempted from further requirement in that language. Students passing a qualifying examination on the A2 course in any language will be exempted from further requirement in that language. Mathematics: Mathematics A1 or A2. Students passing a qualifying examination on Mathematics A will be exempted from further requirement in mathematics. Natural Science: Biology B1 or Chemistry B1 or Geology B1 or Physics B1. II. Field of Concentration A student who has passed not less than six of the Required Courses two years before graduation, shall at the beginning of his next session select as his Field of Concentration a Major Subject taught in one of the Academic Schools. Before registration he must present, as part of his plan of study for the next two years, a program of not less than five nor more than seven courses approved in writing by an official adviser for his Major School. This program must include not less than three courses offered in the Major School and not less than two courses in subjects related to the Field of Concentration. No course offered by the candidate as a Required Course may be counted as part of the major program. All courses included in a Field of Concentration must be completed in this University. III. Electives The remaining courses needed to make up the required twenty may be elected from courses in the Academic Schools for which the candidate has adequate preparation. Final Comprehensive Examination A candidate for a degree must make a satisfactory standing in a final comprehensive examination on his Field of Concentration, set by the faculty of his Major School. This examination shall be in lieu of separate final examinations in all courses in the Field of Concentration, taken in the session of graduation, which the Major School may include in it. It may be wholly a written examination, or partly written and partly oral. Professional Courses in Field of Concentration The first-year course in the Department of Law or the first-year course in the Department of Medicine, of this University, may be substituted for four academic courses in the Field of Concentration. This substitution cannot be made unless the candidate has spent three full sessions in the College of Arts and Sciences of this University and has obtained credit for sixteen courses, including: 1. The eight Required Courses (not less than six of which must be completed at least two years before graduation). Exemption from Required Courses, as provided above, increases the student's freedom of election, but does not reduce the total number of courses (16) which must be completed in the College. 2. A program of four courses, to be taken during the candidate's third year in the College, and to be approved in writing before registration by an adviser designated by the Dean of the College. 3. Electives, chosen from courses in the Academic Schools for which the candidate has adequate preparation. A candidate who includes the first-year course in Law or Medicine in his Field of Concentration is exempted from the Final Comprehensive Examination. Physical Education In addition to satisfying the requirements for graduation stated above, a candidate must complete a two-year course in physical education, unless excused on a physician's certificate. This work must be taken during the first two years and must be completed at least one year before graduation. SUGGESTIONS TO STUDENTS ON PLANNING A BACHELOR OF ARTS OR BACHELOR OF SCIENCE DEGREE Since all but two of the Required Courses must be completed two years before graduation, the student is in general advised to confine himself to such courses in his first year and to postpone freedom of election. In the second year, election of courses should be made primarily with a view to exploring academic fields in which the candidate may wish to major. In general the B1 courses in important subjects which are not represented among the Required Courses should be elected in the second year. The following are suggested as suitable electives to introduce a student to possible Fields of Concentration: Archaeology B1, Astronomy B1, Biblical Literature B1, Economics B1, Government B1, History B1, B2 or B5, Philosophy B1, Psychology B1, Rural Social Economics B1, Sociology B1. Courses in Commerce, Education, the Fine Arts, Forestry or Public Speaking may be elected by students interested in these subjects. As many as two of the Required Courses may be completed as late as the third year. However, it should be noted that an A1 course in a Required language should not be taken later than the second year. If such a course be postponed until the third year, the A2 course in that language must be completed in the following summer, since all Required Courses must be passed at least one year before graduation. It is not advisable to take A1 courses in two foreign languages in the same year. Examples of degree programs are given below. Variations are often desirable. A student who passes qualifying examinations will have greater freedom of election than is indicated. A Field of Concentration, in the programs, is assumed to include six courses. 1. For students who present less than two entrance units in foreign language: First Year: English A1, Language A1, Science B1, Mathematics A1 or A2, Physical Education. Second Year: Language A2, Language A1, Elective, Elective, Elective, Physical Education. Third Year: Language A2, Major, Major, Major, Elective. Fourth Year: Major, Major, Major, Elective, Elective. 2. For students who present entrance units sufficient to enter the A2 course in one foreign language: First Year: English A1, Language A2, Science B1, Mathematics A1 or A2, Physical Education. Second Year: Language A1, Elective, Elective, Elective, Elective, Physical Education. Third Year: Language A2, Major, Major, Major, Elective. Fourth Year: Major, Major, Major, Elective, Elective. 3. For students who present entrance units sufficient to enter the A2 course in each of two foreign languages: First Year: English A1, Language A2, Science B1, Mathematics A1 or A2, Physical Education. Second Year: Language A2, Elective, Elective, Elective, Elective, Physical Education. Third Year: Major, Major, Major, Elective, Elective. Fourth Year: Major, Major, Major, Elective, Elective. DEGREES WITH HONORS The courses required for the B.A. and cultural B.S. degrees are adapted to the powers of the average student, and any graduate of an accredited school, who has, either by certificate or examination, satisfied the requirements for admission to the College of Arts and Sciences, if he is reasonably industrious and regular in his studies, should obtain one of these degrees without great difficulty in four sessions' work. In every body of students, however, there are a number who possess greater ability and application than the average, and whose ambition aims higher than a bare pass-mark on their work. For the proper stimulation of such students toward the best that they can do, and for due and authoritative recognition of unusual ability and high achievement in studies, the Academic Faculty has instituted the following system of Special Honors: Intermediate Honors A certificate of Intermediate Honors is conferred by the Academic Faculty on the student who, during his first two regular sessions in the College of Arts and Sciences of this University, has passed not less than ten academic courses, including six of the eight Required Courses, without failure on any course, and with an average grade on all courses of 85 per cent. or more each session. The holder of a Certificate of Intermediate Honors, so long as he has no grade below 75 per cent. on the work of any term in any course, is not subject to the rules limiting absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class-standing, imposed for absence alone. The Certificates of Intermediate Honors are publicly conferred at the Annual Convocation of the University following the session in which the honors have been attained. The names of the holders of these certificates are published under a separate heading in the annual catalogue of the University. Final Honors Final Honors are conferred only on graduation, and the diploma of B.A. or B.S. with Final Honors states that the honors were won in a given academic school. A student who wishes to attain Final Honors must be accepted as a candidate for honors two sessions before graduation. Any student who has met the requirements for the Dean's List for two sessions may apply to become a candidate for Final Honors. Application must be made first to the Dean, and, if approved by him, must also be approved by one of the academic schools which offer work for honors. A list of such schools is published annually. Final honors are conferred on the basis of a final comprehensive examination, both oral and written, on some field of knowledge, and not for work done in any or all of the regular courses required for a baccalaureate degree. Honors work involves wide and independent reading for two years, under the general direction of the professors of an academic school. It does not require regular attendance upon lectures or the passing of any tests or examinations, except the final examinations, though consultations and reports may be required. Its aim is the development of a capacity for scholarly work in a field of knowledge, rather than a mastery of required details of subject matter. The completion of work for Final Honors may be counted as credit towards a B.A. or cultural B.S. degree in lieu of two courses, other than Required Courses. In the event that the work for honors is not of sufficiently high quality for Final Honors to be conferred, credit for two courses toward a degree without honors may be granted upon recommendation of the academic school in charge. BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN ARCHITECTURE The candidate must complete the courses in the following program. Exemption from Required A courses in English, mathematics and language may be obtained as in the case of the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. Such exemption increases freedom of election, but does not reduce the total number of courses required for the degree. At the beginning of his first and each subsequent year of candidacy for this degree the student must have his program of study approved in writing by an official adviser for the School of Architecture. First Year: Mathematics A1 or A2 English A1 Approved Modern Language or Elective Architectural Drawing B1 Projective Drawing B1 Freehand Drawing B1 Second Year: Architectural Construction B1 History of Art B1 Approved Modern Language or Elective Architectural Design B1 Freehand Drawing B2, first and third terms Modeling B1, second term Projective Drawing B2 Pure Design, second and third terms (Alternate years with History of Ornament) Third Year: Architectural Construction B2 History of Art B2 Economics B1, first and second terms Commercial Law for Architects, third term Architectural Design B2 Water Color B1, first and third terms Modeling B2, second term Elements of Surveying, first term History of Ornament, second and third terms (Alternate years with Pure Design) Fourth Year: Reinforced Concrete Design, first term Mechanical Equipment of Buildings, second and third terms History of Art B3 Architectural Design B3 or B4 Outdoor Sketching, first term Freehand Drawing B3, third term Professional Practice, second term (Given in alternate years) One elective in the second term selected from the following: Colonial Archaeology Perspective Rendering Special Architectural Studies Modeling B3 BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN CHEMISTRY The candidate must complete a total of twenty courses, chosen in accordance with the following program. Exemption from Required A courses in English, mathematics and language may be obtained as in the case of the Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees. In addition, a student who presents admission credit for three units of French is exempted from the requirement of French A1. Such exemption from Required Courses increases freedom of election, but does not reduce the total number of courses (20) required for the degree. Applications for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Chemistry must be approved in writing by an official adviser for the School of Chemistry not later than two years before graduation. First Year: Chemistry B1 English A1 French A1 Mathematics A1 or A2 First-year Physical Education Second Year: Chemistry B2 Chemistry B6 English B6 German A1 or A2 Mathematics B2 Second-year Physical Education Third Year: Chemistry B4 Chemistry B7 Physics B1 German A2 or Approved Elective Fourth Year: Chemistry C1 Chemistry C2 Approved Elective BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN COMMERCE The candidate must complete a total of twenty courses, chosen in accordance with the following regulations: I.

The stipend, after payment of all fees, namely, University, tuition, athletic and Topics fees, will net the holder $483.50. The seventh fellowship, both in duties and stipend, is rated at about half (or a little over) of the above six. All holders of these fellowships are expected to become candidates for graduate degrees, two years usually being required for the Master's degree and three more for the Doctorate. Where marked research ability is developed the duties and time required may be reduced. Requests for application blanks and further information should be made to the Professor in Charge, Rouss Physical Laboratory, University Station, Charlottesville, Virginia. All applications should be submitted not later than March 1. Philip Francis duPont Fellowships: These together with a few others are administered through the office of the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies. Applicants specializing in physics are eligible but must make application to the Dean under conditions laid down under the heading Fellowships in this catalogue. Where the holders of fellowships have no services to render, the time required for winning a graduate degree may be less than that needed by Service Fellows. Attention is directed to the importance of absolving early, preferably before the graduate work is begun, the requirements in French and German for the Doctorate and in modern languages (preferably French or German or both) for the Master's degree.
