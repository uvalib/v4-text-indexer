      <field name="fulltext">PINING WIND (Matsukaze: a woman play) In Pining Wind, the mood of autumn deepens. This play about love's unquenchable longing is wonderfully moving even if one hardly 'understands' it at all: it is a fine example of how a pattern, once traced, can be apprehended in many ways. Together with "Yuya," Pining Wind is traditionally the most popular play of all. Both together have been called what amounts to the actor's bread and butter. Pining Wind was apparently written by Kannami, then reworked by Zeami. Though the story is found nowhere else, Yukihira, Pining Wind's beloved, did in fact exist. He lived from 818 to 893, and was a brilliant courtier and poet. Yukihira's older brother, Narihira, is Yukihira's counterpart in The Well Cradle. Yukihira may actually have been exiled to Suma, a section of shore not far from the modern K?be, and certainly the fictional hero Prince Genji spent several melancholy years there. Pining Wind often echoes the Suma chapter of the Tale of Genji. Prince Genji too had a purification rite performed at Suma on the day of the Serpent, early in the third moon of the year. It is possible to translate the name Pining Wind because the same double meaning exists both in English and in Japanese: matsu means 'to wait' and 'pine tree.' Thus, 'pining wind' really has four meanings: wind blowing through pine boughs; the wind's sound; wind that waits in longing; and finally (taking 'to pine' as a verb that means 'to be a pine') wind that is a pine. This last meaning is danced out near the end of the play. Pining Wind has told in full her love for the long dead Yukihira and has evoked his presence by putting on, as though compelled, the hat and cloak he left her as keepsakes. She has impersonated him. Now, unable to do more, she collapses in despair and sings of Three Shallows River (Mitsusegawa), the river that surrounds the underworld; her spirit has sunk down to hell. But as the lowest leads to the highest, Pining Wind raises her head again to see Yukihira (a pine tree) standing before her in the flesh. He is as much a 'Vert Galant' as the God of Sumiyoshi in Takasago, and he has come instantly, as he promised he would, to Pining Wind's cry of total yearning. When Pining Wind dances around him, she in her human form is wearing his clothes, while he in his pine form sings the song which is of her, the wind. He really is a 'wind-bent pine.' As the moon is the visible sign of wisdom, so the pining wind is the audible sign, or pattern, of divine love. As Yukihira and Pining Wind merge, so do their colors. Near the start of the play, the Sideman says, 'A pine, one lone tree, leaves a green fall.' ('A pine, one lone tree' is matsu hito ki, which can also mean 'the pining one comes.') One sees a pine standing green amid the changing colors of fall, especially the reds and golds of the momiji, the maple leaves—for maple leaves are as much the mark of fall in Japan as in New England. Pining Wind's dance around the tree is the same picture, for her color is that of expanding energy, of burning, of love. Red is indeed the color of a beautiful woman in n?, and the costume for such a role is said to 'contain red.' Sudden Rain, the Second, also has an eloquent name. In Japanese, murasame means a quick, hard shower. So unlike Pining Wind, who is continuous, Sudden Rain is stop-and-start. She forgets while Pining Wind remembers. Appropriately, it is she who introduces the Sideman into the salt shed, and again she, not the pining wind, who disappears in the end. The dialogue between Pining Wind and Yukihira really goes on forever; it is Sudden Rain who is the passing storm which is the play. She is like a sudden whitecap that opens one's eyes to the whole rolling sea. Salt-making, the livelihood of Pining Wind and Sudden Rain, is often mentioned in poetry, and in fact the play contains a tsukushi, or 'inventory,' of places associated with salt-making. (Another 'inventory,' on trees,will be found in The Golden Tablet.) Such a passage means relatively little, but plays a great deal with pun and allusion. It is like a rocky section of stream which effectively prepares one to appreciate the smoother flow beyond. As for salt-making itself, the process it involved (gathering seaweed, pouring brine over it, roasting it, steeping the roasted seaweed in more brine, then finally drawing the liquid off and boiling it down) was more complicated than one might expect.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">A small pine stands down front. SHIDAI Sideman enters and stands at main spot, facing back of stage. SHIDAI on-w Sideman Suma, Akashi along those shores Suma, Akashi along those shores the moon an we'll wander forth! NANORI off-sp facing front You have before you a brother who's taking a look at all lands. Lately I've been in Miyako, where I've seen each scenic spot and ancient relic of noble Rakuy?. Now, I've decided to tramp on to the lands of the West. TSUKI-ZERIFU off-sp Hurrying along that way, here I am all right in the land of Tsu at Suma shore, or some such place. He notices the pine and moves toward it. Remarkable! Right here on the beach there's a striking pine. This pine undoubtedly has a history. I think I'll ask one of the local people. He goes to main spot. Fool is sitting at Fool's spot, and stands up when called. MONDO off-sp Hello! Is anyone around? Fool What can I do for you? Sideman I beg your pardon, but I'm very struck by this pine here on the shore. Can you tell me anything about it? Fool Well, I'm afraid I'm very ignorant when it comes to things like that. But from what I've heard, that pine marks a grave: the grave of two seafolk named Pining Wind and Sudden Rain. It certainly would be kind of you if you'd raise them and pray before you pass on. Sideman Then I'll do so. Thank you. Fool At your service. Fool exits. Sideman moves to center, facing pine. * off-w* Sideman s So, this pine long ago was Pining Wind, Sudden Rain so-called, two seafolk's ancient relic. A sad, sad story! Their bodies are in earth buried but the names linger now, for their sign unchanging in hue a pine, one lone tree leaves a green fall. Ah, most moving! sp Now that I've prayed that way with sutras and invocations to Amida, well, it's just as you'd expect on a fall day: in no time the sun's gone down. That hamlet at the foot of the mountains is a long way off, so I think I'll go up to this seafolk's salt shed and see the night through here. Sideman retires to Sideman's spot. SHIN-NO-ISSEI Stagehand brings on the brine scoop wagon, represented by a small, light framework prop, and places it at base of mark post. One bucket is loaded on it. Now Second enters, wearing the tsure, or Second, mask, and carrying another bucket. She is followed by Doer, wearing the wakaonna, or Young Woman, mask. Second stops at first pine, Doer at third pine. They face each other. ISSEI off-w Doer, Second A brine scoop wagon wheels meagerly the sorry world round and round so cruelly fickle! Second facing front Waves right at our feet on Suma shore Doer, Second again face to face the very moon soaks a trailing Second now moves to center, Doer to main spot. They face front. SASHI off-w Doer Hearts empty in the fall wind so while the sea was somewhat far Doer, Second face to face noble Yukihira the Middle Counsel sang '. . . blows through the pass' where the curved shore waves surge nigh each night sounding so near the seafolk's home; the hamlet's far down our path to and fro beside the moon there's no company. Doer Yes, the sad world's work does claim us but utterly wretched the seafolk's craft that makes no way over life, this dream where 'I live' is no word for a bubble of froth on the brine scoop wagon without safe haven for us, the seafolk whose sleeves together with yearning love the heart never lets dry! They face front. SAGEUTA on-w Chorus 'So thoroughly does all life seem hard to pass through' that in envy we dwell on the clear moon's rising tide, come, scoop! Doer steps forward. Scoop the rising tide! Noticing her reflection, she lowers her head. At 'lingering,' she stares into water again; at 'in the sun,' looks to her right as though gazing along the shore; at first 'shrivel,' retreats to main spot and expresses grief. AGEUTA on-w This image shames me my own form this image shames me my own form shrinks low, a wain drawn withdrawing tides leave lingering pools how long to live on? Yes, on meadow grasses dewdrops in the sun dwindle and vanish but on the pebbled shore sea wrack-raking seafolk cast weeds all a-tangle to shrival, wilting trailing sleeves shrivel, wilting trailing sleeves. KAKEAI off-w Doer Come, come! Let's scoop brine! she says at the sea's edge flood and ebb tides saltyclothes, Second sleeves we tie drape on the shoulder Doer to scoop brine or so we hope Second but hold! try as we may Doer a woman's wagon AGEUTA on-w Chorus rolled in falls back single breakers roll in fall back single waves; Above, Second retreats to drums while Doer goes toward mark post. Now Doer gazes into distance to her right; at 'storm blasts,' she faces front; at 'live it through,' lowers head in dejection; at 'deepening moon,' gazes up to her right at moon; at 'our scoops,' shifts gaze to wagon. out by the reeds cranes start up crying, all four storm blasts add their roar; night's icy cold, how'll we live it through? The deepening moon shines so bright! Our scoops catch the reflection! Salt fire smoke: watch out for that! This is the way we seafolk shall live out gloomy fall. Doer kneels on one knee beside the wagon; at 'scoops,' uses fan to mime ladling brine into bucket, while gazing at moon's reflection within. SAGEUTA on-w Chorus Pine Island's Hero Island's seafolk beneath the moon scoop reflections, ah, with keen delight scoop reflections, ah, with keen delight! Doer returns to main spot. RONGI on-w A long haul's theirs far up north in Michinoku where the name's Near Chika, and Shiogama Salt Kilns . . . Doer 'Humble men hauled salt wood . . .'— on Akogi coast it was withdrawing tides . . . Chorus Yes, the same Ise sea has Futami, Twin Glance, shore, and it's twice I'd go out in the world! Doer Pine groves stand hazy glows the sun as tide roads, far, far out sound past Narumigata, Bight of the Sounding Sea; Chorus yonder's Narumigata, here at Naruo beneath the pines moonlight's blocked off by Reedy Roofs of Ashinoya. Doer Scooping brine from Nada Channel's a sad life, though tell none willow comb Chorus thrust in combing tides scoop down and look! the moon right in my pail! Above at 'thrust,' Second approaches wagon and places her bucket on it. Doer stares into buckets from where she stands. Now, Doer advances a little; Second hands her the cord for pulling the wagon, then goes to main spot. At 'moon is one,' Doer gazes aloft, then back to wagon; at 'for tonight,' she pulls wagon up to drums, then turns round and gazes into buckets once more; at 'tide roads,' stamps beat. Doer In mine too the moon's slipped in! Chorus Oh lovely! Here too the moon! Doer Moon is one Chorus reflections two three the brimming tide for tonight our wagon's loaded with the moon. Sad? Why, not at all, the tide roads of the sea! Stagehand removes the wagon. Doer sits on a stool before drums, facing front; Second sits in the ordinary way a little behind her and to her right. They are in the salt shed. Sideman stands and faces them. MONDO off-w* Sideman sp Excuse me, there in the salt shed! I beg your pardon! Second stands and advances a little toward Sideman. Second What is it? Sideman I'm traveling through, and the sun's gone down on me. I'd appreciate shelter for the night. Second Please wait a moment. I'll ask the owner. She kneels on one knee before Doer. Henceforth she moves thus between Doer and Sideman, as appropriate. Excuse me, but a traveler has come. He says he'd like shelter for the night. Doer That's a simple request, no doubt, but this place isn't fit to be seen. Please tell him we really can't let him stay. Second I asked the owner, who says that as this place isn't fit to be seen, we really can't let you stay. Sideman I quite understand. But if the place isn't fit to be seen, it certainly won't bother me. I'm a wandering monk, after all. So I do ask you again: please allow me to see the night through here. Second The traveler is a monk, and he insists on asking again for a night's shelter. Doer What! You say the traveler's a monk? s By the moon's night shine I see one who's cast off the world; well, it will do, this seafolk's home with posts of pine and bamboo fence. The night's cold, I know; tell him to warm himself at our rush fire and stay. Second Do please come in. Sideman Ah, with pleasure! Sideman advances a few steps and sits, while Second returns to her place. They are in the shed. MONDO off-w* Doer sp From the start I wanted to put you up. But this place isn't fit to be seen, and that's why I refused. Sideman Thank you for your kindness. I've always been a monk and a wanderer, and it's not mine to settle anywhere. So how should I choose my shelter? Certainly, here on Suma shore, any sensitive person ought actually to prefer a rather melancholy life: s 'Should one by chance inquire for me, say I'm at Suma shore; sp say the tangle-salt drips down and I am sad.' Yes, that's what Yukihira himself sang. By the way, when I saw that lone pine over there on the shore, I asked a fellow about it. He said something about it being an ancient relic of two seafolk named Pining Wind and Sudden Rain. Of course they're nothing to me, but I did comfort them and pray before I went on. Doer and Second both hide tears. Doer, Second s Oh, it's true! When love's within, love's hues show without! The way you quoted, 'Should one by chance inquire for me,' gave such pangs of longing! And tears of Jambudv?pa, the world of clinging, wet our sleeves once more. They both weep. MONDO off-sp Sideman Tears of Jambudv?pa, the world of clinging? You talk like people who've left this life! And the poem 'Should one by chance' gives you pangs of longing, or so I gather. It's all very strange. Both of you, name yourselves! KUDOKI-GURI off-w Doer, Second I'm ashamed! Let me begin to tell, and should one by chance inquire after me, he'd vanish, a shadow world where salt-drenched I learn no lesson but ever assume a surely bitter heart! KUDOKI off-w After all this, what need we so carefully conceal? We are . . . This twilight past you kindly raised two vanished shades up from the moss beneath that pine, Pining Wind, Sudden Rain, They turn to Sideman. two girls' darkened spirits have come to you here. Yes, Yukihira a full three years lightened his leisure with pleasant boating; the moon cleared his heart on Suma shore. While we hauled the night brine with seafolk maidens he courted and chose us. 'What perfect names for now!' he said and deigned to call us Pining Wind, Sudden Rain. The moon we knew well, we Suma seafolk. Doer but saltburner's clothes were all transformed Doer, Second to stiff silk summer robes censed with sweet fragrance. Doer So three years flew; then Yukihira went up to our Sovereign's Seat. Second He'd no sooner gone than this life, so young, Doer, Second he departed: so we heard. Doer And ever since, oh, I've missed him so! Still, perhaps in another life he'll come calling UTA on-w Chorus pining Wind and Sudden Rain drench these sleeves helpless, alas, with love far beyond us. The Suma seafolk are deep in sin: They bow to Sideman with palms joined. kindly, brother, raise our shadows! They turn front again. At second 'dew,' Second goes to sit before Chorus, while Sideman retires to Sideman's spot; at 'melt away,' Doer looks down, showing deep emotion. AGEUTA on-w Love's grasses grow dew, passions all tangled dew, passions all tangled; the heart's madness wears dear easy robes. The Day of the Serpent brings a blessing! Mulberry streamers to ask the gods' help wave on useless wave-borne froth we grieve and melt away to lasting sorrow! After opening words of the passage below, stagehand gives Doer a length of cloth to represent the cloak, and an eboshi hat. At 'each time,' Doer lifts them up and gazes at them; at 'blade tips,' she gazes at ends of her own sleeves; at 'his keepsakes,' lifts them high again; at 'someone sang,' lowers them and checks tears; at 'on and on,' stands, still holding hat and cloak, and goes to mark post; at 'fruitless,' throws them down, but instantly picks them up again and holds them close; at 'standing, lying,' turns to her right up to main spot, then looks back toward bridgeway as though pursued by a power; at 'sink down,' collapses, weeping, to a sitting position. KUSE on-w Chorus Alas! When I recall the past I miss him so! Yukihira the Middle Counsel three years dwelt on Suma shore, then went up to our Sovereign's Seat. 'Some keepsakes of these days!' he said and kindly left us a tall court hat, a hunting cloak. Each time I see them ever more passion grasses spring; the blade tips bear dewdrops gone so soon might I forget, oh, wretched agony! 'His keepsakes, yes, are now my foe: without them a forgetful pause might come,' so someone sang: very true! More and more my love deepens in power. Doer Dusk after dusk before I sleep I shed the hunting habit, Chorus put it on and on I beg that in one same world . . . Life is empty, I can't forget these fruitless keepsakes! She throws them down but cannot leave them, takes them up and his shape looms. Standing lying are the same: 'From the pillow, from the bed's foot love comes against me;' helpless, weeping I sink down in utter misery. Stagehand approaches Doer, drapes the cloak over her and places the hat on her head. Below, Doer checks tears. SHIMO-NO-EI off-weak Doer Three Shallows River: endless tears, that unhappy shoal, hold, yes, even they, a gulf of churning love. She looks up. KAKEAI off-w* s Oh, what happiness! Yukihira's standing right over there! She stands and moves toward pine. 'Pining Wind!' he's calling! I'm going to him! Second quickly stands, grasps Doer's right sleeve. At 'crazed longing,' Doer goes to drums, Second retreats toward side. Second How awful! It's just the state you're in now that sinks one in the sin of clinging. You still haven't escaped the crazed longing you felt when you belonged to the world! That's a pine tree. Yukihira just isn't there. Doer sp You're unsteady to talk that way! That pine is Yukihira! s Though for a while we may be parted, tell me you're pining and I'll come back: so he sang for us— now what do you say? Second You're right! I'd completely forgotten! Though for a while we may be parted, pine and I'll come: those were the words Doer I'd not forgotten pining wind's up now he's coming home, his message Second one day may touch sudden rain to wet these sleeves a while, surely Doer pining as ever he's coming home, Second we trusted rightly Doer his dear poem: WAKA off-w Doer, Second 'I'm up to leave you, Hiding tears, Doer runs toward bridgeway; Second, crying too, goes to sit before Chorus. CHU-NO-MAI Doer runs back onstage from first pine, stopping at main spot. She then does a ch?-no-mai dance. At last, as she resumes the singing of the poem, she strikes fan high pose. WAKA off-w bound away for Inaba's mountain peaks so green with pining's needless: call me and it's now I'll be home.' Below, at 'yonder,' Inaba,' Doer gazes into distance toward bridgeway; at 'here my longing,' comes to center, pointing at pine with fan; at 'curved shore,' sweeps fan around, indicating an expanse of sea; at 'back with me,' turns right up to drums; at 'by the tree,' glides down to the pine; at 'love him still,' retreats, weeping, back to drums. NORIJI onori-w Doer Yonder, Inaba's far mountain pines Chorus here my longing my beloved Lord here on Suma's curved shore pines Yukihira back with me while by the tree I rise now, draw near so dear the wind bent pine, I love him still! HO-NO-MAI Doer stops weeping, lifts her head and dances round and round the tree. This ha-no-mai dance is brief, but spirited. As text resumes, she moves to center, making beckoning gestures; at 'mighty waves,' sweeps fan around and gazes out over sea; at 'clinging,' turns right up to main spot; then moves to center, kneels facing Sideman and joins palms in prayer; at 'good-bye,' stands, stamps beat; at 'Suma shore,' goes to mark post and strikes clasped fan pose while gazing toward mountains in the direction of the flute post; at 'cocks,' moves downstage from Sideman's spot, strikes cloud fan pose and gazes into sky; at 'you heard indeed,' goes to main spot; at first 'pining wind,' opens toward front, then faces side and stamps final beat. NORIJI onori-w Chorus Pining the tree-bound wind turns mad, Suma's mighty waves rage the night through; wrongful clinging dreams us for you, kindly, raise our shadows! Good-bye we say retreating waves sound UTA on-w clear down Suma shore blows the back hills' seaward breeze; the pass road's where cocks are crowing, the dream is gone without a shadow night opens into dawn. Sudden rain you heard indeed but this morning see, pining wind is all that lingers pining wind alone lingers on.</field>
