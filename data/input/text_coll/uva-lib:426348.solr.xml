      <field name="fulltext">TO THE MEMBERS OF THE VIRGINIA HISTORICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY: Gentlemen, Excuse the liberty I take in asking the protection of your name, for a work which I am compelled to throw upon the world under the most inauspicious circumstances. You seem to constitute the most appropriate body, to which I can look for aid in perfecting the great work which I have undertaken, and of which this imperfect essay constitutes the first fruit. To render a work of this description a perfect picture of the moral and political condition of a state, and a faithful record of its progress to its present condition, the efforts of no single individual can be adequate; but the united and persevering exertion of a number of gentlemen associated for the express purpose of investigating and developing the resources of the state, and finding and preserving the records of its history, are absolutely necessary. I now venture to call your attention to the first work which has ever appeared since the publication of Mr. Jefferson's notes, which professed to embrace all which could be ascertained of the present situation of Virginia, and some investigation of its past history. That materials for a much more copious detail of both subjects exists, no one can doubt, but with the hope that the information here collected may not be altogether useless, I venture to ask the protection of your countenance, And remain, gentlemen, With the greatest respect, Your most obedient And most humble Servant, JOSEPH MARTIN.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">PREFACE. We are well aware that it is considered by critics to be an act of unpardonable impertinence to obtrude an imperfect work upon the notice of the public, and then apologize for its imperfections. But we beg leave to assure their cynical Lordships that this is no meat for them, and of course they need not whet their beaks at our announcement of its imperfections. Our apology is not made to deprecate their wrath, but in deference to a generous public, which will be thankful to the enterprize which gives it a mass of information which was not possessed before, and not cavil because every fact is not given which exists, or those which are given are not in the very best form in which they could have been presented. The publisher of this work lays claim to no literary attainment whatever: he only claims the merit due to boldness in enterprize and unconquerable perseverance in execution. He has been upwards of two years collecting the materials for this work, from individuals residing in every quarter of the state, expending much money in the acquisition of his matter, at a time when he was scarcely able to support his family. But this method of collecting matter, although it produced considerable delay, ensured the most recent and authentic information which could be procured. The almost innumerable contributions when received had to be examined and arranged, and such parts as were thought either useful or interesting, culled from the mass of unnecessary matter which sometimes encumbered the communications.— When this was done, and the publisher thought he had obtained such an amount of information as would be highly useful, although it would not form a perfect Gazetteer of Virginia, he resolved to publish and rely upon subsequent editions to make-up the deficiencies. But here a new difficulty occurred:—without credit and without capital, it seemed impossible to find an individual to print, or one to edit the book. The huge mass of undigested manuscript was presented to several literary gentlemen, who shrunk from the task of arranging so voluminous a collection of ill-written manuscript, upon the contingency of being paid by the sale of the work. At length, however, a young man who had no experience in such matters was induced to undertake it, but his occasional absence and necessary attention to other business, added to a most illegible chirography caused many errors of the press which it was out of his power to correct. The printers also were new in their business, and not prepared for conducting it with that attention to neatness and accuracy which was desirable. But although there are many glaring typographical errors, which the editor could not correct, because he did not see the proof sheets, it is believed that very few of them effect the sense, and still fewer falsify statements of fact. The publisher has at length struggled through difficulties, which often seemed insuperable to less persevering men, and now presents the work to the public, if not as perfect as it might be, yet certainly as perfect as he could at this time make it. The publisher feels it his duty to render the most grateful acknowledgments to the many individuals who have rendered him assistance in the collection of materials; and begs leave to mention the names of a few literary gentlemen to whose kindness he is under especial obligation,—among these are Messrs. James E. Heath of Richmond, Lewis Summers of Kanawha, Lucien Minor of Louisa, J. R. W. Dunbar of Winchester, Thomas S. Pleasants of Goochland, W. G. Minor of Caroline, J. R. Fitzhugh of Stafford, R. L. Cook of Augusta, Archibald Stuart of Patrick, Linn Banks, of Madison, William Shultice of Mathews, A. Sparks of Southampton, F. Mallory of Norfolk, H. L. Hopkins of Powhatan, J. Minor of Spottsylvania, J. H. Lee of Orange, Wm. Green of Culpeper, Wm. A. Harris of Page, R. B. Semple of King &amp; Queen, Yeardley Taylor of Loudoun, Isaac Flesher of Jackson, Wm. Burk of Monroe, S. Philips of Bedford, J. D. McGill of Middlesex, N. M. Taliaferro of Franklin, G. W. G. Browne of Wythe, J. J. Williams of Frederick Wm. J. Williams of Charlotte, Joseph Jenney of Prince William, James P. Carrell of Russell, B. F. Dabney of King William, Joseph Duff of Lee, James Garland of Nelson, Wm. Wilson of Bath; and Edgar Snowden of Alexandria. Many more have sent in contributions well worthy of special notice, who have been perhaps as liberal as these gentlemen in the extent of their communications, and the trouble they seem to have taken, but it would be difficult to know where to stop, if he was to publish the names of all to whom he is under obligations. Such portions of the Gazetteer as are not original have been compiled from the Encyclopœdia Americana, the Gazetteer of the United States, Elliott's District of Columbia, or Official Documents. Apology is due for publishing the hasty composition which is called rather from its length than its character, a History of Virginia. The publisher promised in his prospectus between six and seven hundred pages, and all who saw his manuscript volumes supposed they would, unless very extensively curtailed overrun a thousand, but when the matter came to be edited and printed, it did not hold out as well as was supposed. This unfortunately could not be ascertained until the Gazetteer was through the press, and then it was necessary to fill it up with a more extensive, instead of the concise, history which had been promised. The time was of course too limited, being written as fast as three active compositors could print, for the author to have an opportunity to pay any attention whatever to his language or style, or to digress upon the many topics which so invitingly offered, or turn his eyes for a moment to other colonies or countries. He was compelled to proceed with the single isolated narrative of Virginia history, and he trusts that the subject itself is so interesting that it will be read even in his hasty sketch. Were he and his work not both infinitely too humble for criticism to hawk at, he would expect to be torn in pieces for the audacity of dignifying the hasty composition of little more than a fortnight, with the noble name of history; but he feels perfectly secure in his insignificance, and if the insent swarin of little critics should be inclined to inflict their venomous stings upon him, he can throw around himself a shield, which even their utmost fury cannot penetrate, and that is the consciousness that his hasty sketch was not written with the expectation of meeting with approbation as a philosophic treatise upon the history of Virginia, but merely with the hope of presenting a succinct and faithful narrative of the early events of the colony. This he has labored assiduously to effect, consulting every authority which it was possible to examine in so short a time; and if on any subject, all is not said which might have been said, or all which is said is not true, he at least feels sure that he has respectable authority for every word he utters, and that he believes all to be true. All the circumstances of the case, we doubt not with a liberal public, will ensure this first attempt to describe Virginia as it exists at the present day, a favorable reception; and it will respect the disposition and the enterprize which has given them so much, rather than blame the stern poverty which would not allow the publisher to wait longer, without receiving some emolument. With the proceeds of this edition he expects to be able to subsist, until he can prepare a work more worthy of the noble state whose moral and physical attributes he delineates. It will be perceived that a new plan has been adopted in the arrangement. Instead of giving a continuous alphabetical list of subjects and places, from the beginning to the end of the volume, by which means much repetition must occur, and frequent references have to be made in order to obtain an account of any county or section of country; the work is divided into three parts, first a general description of the moral and physical character of the whole state is given, and then of the two great portions, eastern and western Virginia separately, and under these latter heads a general description is given of each county, in alphabetical order, and under each county an alphabetical list of the most remarkable places it contains; a general alphabetical index at the end completes the system. The object of this arrangement was to present to the mind each separate portion of country at once, in a connected view, so that the reader at a distance might form as good an idea of the state of improvement in each county, as if he were on the spot, which it would be impossible to do, if each little place was seattered through the book in a general alphabetical arrangement, whilst it was thought that the general index would make it as convenient for purposes of mere reference as it would be under the old system. The same wish to present a connected view, and the different characteristics which distinguish Eastern and Western Virginia, produced the division of the state into these two portions. It is unnecessary to enlarge upon the necessity which existed for such a work, it has been felt by every traveller, man of business, and literary man in the community; and the information here collected, existed for the most part only in the minds of those who have contributed it. The desideratum is not yet however fully supplied, as no individual has been found willing to contribute the information, which was wanting with regard to many of the counties; but this it is hoped may be obtained in time for another edition. With a hope that what is already accomplished will meet the expectations and approbation of those who have so liberally patronized him, the work is for the present dismissed.

      <field name="fulltext">GAZETTEER OF VIRGINIA. PRELIMINARIES. 3 VIRGINIA. SITUATION, BOUNDARIES, AND EXTENT. Virginia was one of the original thirteen, and is now one of the twenty four United States of North America, it lies between 36° 31′, and 40° 39′ north latitude; and 6° 35′ west, and 1° 48′ east longitude from Washington city it is bounded on the north and northeast by Pennsylvania and Maryland, east by the Atlantic ocean, south by North Carolina and Tennessee, and west by Kentucky and Ohio, its mean length from east to west is 355 miles, its mean breadth 185 miles, and its horizontal area 65,624 square miles. The Atlantic bounds Virginia, from the extreme south-eastern angle of Maryland, to the extreme north-eastern angle of North Carolina, a distance of 112 miles; North Carolina bounds it on the south, from the Atlantic west to the Iron Mountains, 340 miles, from this point the boundary runs along the Iron Mountains in a north-easterly direction, to the northeast angle of Tennessee, four miles, Tennessee then forms a border to the Cumberland mountains 110 miles, then Kentucky, along the Cumberland mountains to the Tug Fork of Sandy river, 110 miles, thence the boundary runs down this stream to the Ohio 70 miles. The boundary follows the Ohio from the mouth of Tug Fork of Sandy, to the point at which it emerges from Pennsylvania, 355 miles; from this it runs south in common with the western border of Pennsylvania, 64 miles, thence east along its southern border to the north-western angle of Maryland, 58 miles, from this, south to the head of the north branch of the Potomac 36 miles, and down the Potomac to its mouth, 320 miles; it then crosses the Chesapeake Bay, and runs east, along the southern boundary of Maryland to the Atlantic, 60 miles—presenting an entire outline of 1,635 miles. Face of the Country—Natural and Political Sections—Virginia exceeds all of her sister States in territorial extent, and is perhaps the most strongly marked in her physical features. Like Maryland and North Carolina, she has her sea and alluvial section, below the head of tide-water; her middle and hilly section; and her central or mountainous section; but in Virginia a fourth section must be added, which may be called the western or Ohio section, its waters emptying into that stream. These four sections are so distinctly marked in their features as to be recognized in the fundamental law of the State, and must ever have important political and moral effects. Adopting the limits indicated in the new constitution, these four sections contain as follows, viz. First—The section from the sea coast to the head of tide-water, thirty-six counties, and three towns, to wit: Accomac, Caroline, Chesterfield, Charles City, Essex, Elizabeth City, Fairfax, Greensville, Gloucester, Hanover, Henrico, Isle of Wight, James City, King and Queen, King William, King George, Lancaster, Mathews, Middlesex, Nansemond, New Kent, Northumberland, Northampton, Norfolk, Princess Anne, Prince George, Prince William, Richmond, Southampton, Spottsylvania, Stafford, Surry, Sussex, Warwick, Westmoreland, York, and the city of Richmond, borough of Norfolk, and town of Petersburg; which are all together entitled to 36 Representatives in the House of Delegates. Second—The territory stretching from the head of tide-water to the Blue Ridge, contains 30 counties, to wit. Albemarle, Amelia, Amherst, Bedford, Buckingham, Brunswick, Campbell, Charlotte, Cumberland, Culpeper, Dinwiddie, Fauquier, Fluvanna, Franklin, Goochland, Henry, Halifax, Loudon, Louisa, Lunenburg, Madison, Mecklenburg, Nelson, Nottoway, Orange, Patrick, Pittsylvania, Powhatan, Prince Edward, and Rappahannock, which together have 42 Representatives in the House of Delegates. Third—The Valley section contains 15 counties, to wit Augusta, Alleghany, Bath, Berkley, Bottetourt, Frederick, Hampshire, Hardy, Jefferson, Morgan, Page, Pendleton, Rockingham, Rockbridge, and Shenandoah, which together elect 25 members of the House of Delegates. Fourth—The Trans-Alleghany, or western section, contains 30 counties, to wit: Brooke, Cabell, Fayette, Floyd, Grayson, Greenbrier, Giles, Harrison, Jackson, Montgomery, Monongalia, Kanawha, Lee, Lewis, Logan, Mason, Monroe, Nicholas, Ohio, Pocahontas, Preston, Randolph, Russell, Scott, Smyth, Tazewell, Tyler, Washington, Wood, and Wythe; which together elect 31 delegates to the House of Delegates. Section First—There is little of Virginia actually level, this term being strictly applicable only to the counties of Accomac and Northampton, on the eastern side of the Chesapeake, and to Princess Anne, Norfolk, and Nansemond on the west; containing an aggregate area of only about 2200 square miles, or less than the thirty-first part of the State. The shores of the peninsula east of the Chesapeake, which constitute the two counties of Accomac and Northampton, are low and flat, about 60 miles long, and from 10 to 15 wide, and bounded towards the sea by a string of low sandy islets. The waters of the Chesapeake enter the sea between cape Charles and cape Henry, forming a straight of fifteen miles in width. Norfolk, one of the principle ports of Virginia, has a good harbour in the southern part of the bay, near the mouth of James River. The embouchure of the James forms a speacious haven, called Hampton Roads, in which all the navies in the world might ride; this haven was formerly open, but the strong fortifications, castle Calhoun, and fortress Monroe, on the opposite sides of the entrance would now probably render it impracticable for an adverse fleet to enter.—[See Old Point Comfort—Elizabeth city county.] Except in depth, extent, and position the Chesapeake does not differ essentially from Pamlico and Albemarle sounds on the south, or Delaware bay on the north. Virginia and Maryland occupy the centre of a physical section, remarkable for its deep and wide rivers, and the tributaries of the Chesapeake seem in this respect to imitate their great reservoir. The Pocomoke, Nantikoke, Choptank, and Chester on the east; and the James, York, Rappahannock, Potomac, Patuxent, and Patapsco on the west, all widen into expansive bays before their final discharge. These minor bays gradually become less deep and wide, as they approach the head of tide water, but they retain the distinctive character of bays as far as the tide penetrates. West of the Chesapeake, the country gradually rises into hill and dale, though much marshy and flat land skirts the wide mouths of the rivers, and the minor bays which they form. The soil of the section under review is strictly alluvial, for though the face of the country, on approaching the primitive ledge which terminates the tides, is diversified by waving hills, yet its structure is of the character styled by geologists ancient alluvial. The greater part of the substrata are composed of sand and pebbles; large masses of rock in their original position are rare, except at great depths. Section Second—The Blue Ridge traverses Virginia for 260 miles, in a direction from S. W. to N. E. and except where passed by the James and Roanoke rivers it is a continuous range. It constitutes a county limit throughout its progress in this state. Falling from this finely delineated chain, is an inclined plain, containing 15,386 square miles, terminated by the head of the Atlantic tides. This beautiful section, if we merely regard the fall of water, has a declivity of about 300 to 500 feet; but the fall of water gives a very inadequate idea of the slope in the arable soil, which towards the Blue Ridge rises in many places, to at least 1000 feet, in the spaces between the rivers. The face of nature though exhibiting little of grandeur, is extremely rich and pleasing in the endless variety of hill, valley and river scenery. In the higher part, besides the magnificent back ground of the Blue Ridge, the more distinct ranges of the Alleghany may be seen towering above it, from the detached ranges in its neighborhood; all of which tells that the solid structure of the section is Appalachian, and that the outer ridges of that system influence the course of the waters, as may be seen in the Roanoke, James, Rappahannock and Potomac rivers. This section is as healthy as any portion of the world, the water is excellent and plentiful throughout, the lands fertile, producing in abundance all the staples of the state; easily recovered when exhausted, and always susceptible of high improvement by judicious management, the farms are smaller than in the tide water district, the people are industrious and intelligent, and from James river to the Potomac perhaps are the best farmers in the state. Mr. Jefferson pronounced that portion of this section which lies under the south west range of mountains, to be the garden spot of America; and General Washington, when written to by Sir John Sinclair to recommend to him some spot for a residence in America, after passing in review the whole union, pronounced a residence some where on the eastern side of the Blue Ridge, between the Potomac and the James, to combine most advantages, and be the most desirable. Section Third—The great valley section is in some respects the most remarkable in Virginia; it extends from the Iron mountains, at the N. E. angle of Tennessee, to the northern bend of the Potomac, at Hancockstown, its mean length is near 300 miles; the mean distance between the Blue Ridge and Alleghany about 43. This is a continuation of the Kittatinny valley of Pennsylvania, and is a true table-land or mountain plateau. The rise to this plateau is abrupt, the difference of the mean elevation on the east, and west sides of the Blue Ridge being from 200 to 300 feet. The elevation of Lynchburg is only 500 feet, whilst that of Staunton, near the sources of the Shenandoah is 1,152 feet; Lexington, in Rockbridge county, 902 feet; Salem, on the Roanoke, in Botetourt county, 1,200 feet; and the Warm Springs, in Bath county, 1,782 feet; and the mean elevation of the farms throughout the section in all probability exceeds 1000 feet. A stratum of limestone of varying breadth, runs nearly parallel with the Blue Ridge, on its western side, which continues to accompany it in its course through Maryland, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. The surface of the great valley of Virginia is much broken and diversified, but every where contains zones of highly productive soil; it abounds, with few exceptions, with the purest and best water, and is so rich in scenery, as to afford an endless variety of beautiful landscape. With regard to declivity, the Valley presents some curious phenomena. The northern and nearly one half of the whole surface declines to the N. E., towards the Potomac, and is drained by the Shenandoah, Cacapon, and south branch of Potomac. South of the sources of the Potomac and Shenandoah, is a middle valley; which inclines to the east, and is drained by the James and Roanoke the extreme southern part of the valley inclines to the north west; and is drained by New river, and the great Kenawha. We thus perceive that this table land is partly inclined towards the Atlantic, and partly towards the Ohio; and that the inflected line which separates the sources of the James and Roanoke, which flow into the former, from those of the great Kenawha, flowing into the latter,—crosses the valley obliquely from the Blue Ridge to the Alleghany. Section Fourth—The extreme length of the Ohio section of Virginia, from the northern boundary of Tenessee, to the northern angle of Brooke county, is nearly 300 miles. The greatest breadth is nearly along the general course of the great Kenawha, about 135 miles; but both extremes are narrow; the mean width is about 94 miles. The area 28,337 square miles. The surface is for the most part mountainous, and nearly every where broken. The chains of the Appalachian system stretch over it, in a course nearly parallel to that part of the Ohio which bounds Virginia. The soil is even more variable in quality than the surface is in elevation, every grade of sterility and fertility may be found. As the elevation of the water, at the junction of the Ohio and great Kenawha is 533 feet, and that point is only about 40 miles from the mouth of the great Sandy, the lowest point in western Virginia, we may regard all the surface of the Ohio section as rising above 500 feet. The elevation of Wheeling above the Ocean is 634 feet; and the Ohio, the base of this great inclined plane, and the recipient of the waters of western Virginia, rises upwards of 560 feet, nearly to a level with lake Erie. The dividing ridge of the waters of the Ohio and Atlantic, is the apex of the plain before us, and has its highest elevation in the mountains, from which the sources of the James and Roanoke rise on one side, and those of the great Kenawha on the other. Under the heads of Giles, Pochahontas, and Monroe counties, which occupy the highest part of the plain we are surveying, it may be seen, that the mean elevation of the arable soil exceeds 1,600 feet. A similar, if not a higher, mean height might be assigned to the sources of the great Kanawha, from those of the Greenbrier to those of New river. From these elevated vallies the sources of the Ohio flow, like radii from a common centre. The different branches of the Monongahela rise in Lewis and Randolph counties, and flowing north, through Harrison,, Monongalia, and Preston counties, enter Pennsylvania; and uniting their waters, continue north, to meet those of the Alleghany, and form the Ohio, at Pittsburg. The Ohio from Pittsburg sweeps a curve first north westward, then westward for nearly 100 miles, in a course nearly parallel with the Monongahela, the two streams flowing in opposite directions. From the large curve of the Ohio below Pittsburg, to the influx of the little Kenawha, there is only a narrow inclined plane of about 30 miles width, between the Ohio, and the sources of creeks which flow eastwardly into the Monongahela. Down this plain flow, Harmans, Cross, Buffalo, Wheeling, Fish, Fishing, Middle Island, and some other creeks of less note. Near the little Kenawha the plain widens, and the declivity inclines from W. to N. W. this declination is also maintained in the vallies of the great Kenawha, and great Sandy rivers. The tributary waters of the extreme southern part of the Ohio section of Virginia, though drained into the same recipient, are borne from the elevated plateau, between the sources of the great Kenawha and Tennessee, and before their discharge make the immense semicircular curve of the latter. The difference of level between high-water mark on the Ohio river, and the elevation we have noticed, is about a mean of 850 feet; but this elevation is only the first in a series of planes, which rise one above another, until a mean height of between 1800 and 2000 feet, is attained in central Virginia. If we assume latitude 38° 10′ as the central latitude, it will at longitude 3° west of Washington city, correspond nearly with the greatest elevation, and estimating 400 feet as an equivalent to a degree of latitude, the counties along the mountainous section of Virginia will have a climate, similar to that in north latitude 43° on the Atlantic coast. If from the foregoing elements, we embrace the whole of Virginia, we have before us, a large section of the United States; extending over more than 4° of latitude, and 8¾° of longitude, differing in relative level upwards of 2000 feet, without estimating mountain peaks, or ridges. If we suppose the actually settled parts of the United States, to be 630,000 square miles, Virginia will embrace one ninth part. It is as we have seen traversed from S. W. to N. E. by the Appalachian system of mountains in lateral chains; of these the Blue Ridge is the most distinctly defined, but is only one of six or seven chains that may be traced and identified across the state. One of these chains, though omitted in some maps and broken into fragments in others, is in nature little less obvious than the Blue Ridge; and is distinct throughout its course in Virginia. This neglected Appalachian chain stretches at a distance, varying from 15 to 30 miles, southeastwardly from the Blue Ridge. It is known in New Jersey as Schooley's mountain, and though entirely apparent through Pennsylvania, it has received no distinct appellation in that state. In Maryland it is called the Parr Spring Ridge, and is rendered very conspicuous where it is traversed by the Potomac, by the fine conical peak called the Sugar Loaf. In Virginia it traverses Loudon, Fauquier, Orange, Albemarle, Nelson, Amherst, Bedford, Franklin, and Henry counties. West of the Blue Ridge, the mountain chains are also very confusedly delineated on our maps, though they are far from being so in nature; even on Tanner's large map of the United States, the continuous chains cease with the Alleghany, whilst in fact western Virginia is traversed by three distinct chains, west of this mountain;—indeed the whole state, from the head of tide-water to the Ohio, is formed of a series of mountain chains, and intervening vallies. This structure is obvious to all who examine the map, with a knowledge of the influence of the direction of the hills upon the inflection of the streams. Among the mountain chains however, the Blue Ridge must ever be the most important, physically and politically. This chain stands distinct and detached from the rest, in a remarkable manner. Its highest points are the Peaks of Otter, in Botetourt county, which may be seen at a great distance; one of them is remakable for its symmetry, being conical, and terminating in a limestone cube, the upper surface of which is scarcely sufficiently extensive to contain a dozen persons. It has been supposed that these beautiful peaks, are the highest points in the Appalachian system, S. W. of the Delaware, if computed from their base; but the White Top peaks of the Iron mountains, near the North Carolina line are now thought to be still more elevated. The different portions of the state are strikingly distinguished from each other in their appearance. The tide-water or eastern section, is in general low, level, sandy, and unproductive,—in some parts exhibiting almost as desolate appearance as the pine barrens of New Jersey. Above the falls of the rivers, the country presents a bolder and more picturesque outline, and the soil if not generally productive, is in most cases capable of improvement; the alluvial lands on river and creek bottoms of this section are very fine; those on James river will compare with any in the world for fertility. The valley section contains a considerable portion of mountainous and sterile land; but no part of the commonwelth presents larger tracts of fertile and well cultivated soil, or better adapted to the cultivation of every species of grain. West of the Alleghany, a large portion of the country must for ever remain in its primitive forest; it is generally mountainous and broken, but interspersed with fertile vallies, well calculated to grazing, and raising stock, and occasionally presenting rich bodies of limestone. From the vast extent of this state and the variety of its surface, we should of course expect a great diversity of climate. In the Atlantic country, east of the mountains, the heat of summer is long and oppressive, the spring short and variable, and the winter extremely mild,—snow seldom lying more than a day after it has fallen. Droughts in summer and autumn are common, and the people are subject to autumnal fevers. On the mountains, the air is cool, and salubrious, and the inhabitants are tall and muscular, with robust forms, and healthy countenances; fires are used during five months in the year, the heat of summer during the day is considerable, but the nights are always cool. On the western side of the mountain the climate is cooler by several degrees, than on the same parallel of latitude on the coast, the valley of the Ohio, is exceedingly hot in summer, while in winter, the river is sometimes frozen for two months at a time, so hard as to be passed on the ice, the autumn is dry, temperate, and healthy, and the weather most delightful. From the facts which have been stated with regard to the variety of soil, and climate in Virginia; a corresponding variety in the staple productions will at once be suggested. Every vegetable, from cotton to wheat, and the fig to the apple, can be produced in abundance. When discovered and colonized by Europeans, the region now comprised in Virginia, was one continued dense, and vary partially broken forest. A few savage tribes were found along the tide-waters, but the interior was scarcely inhabited. It may be remarked that though the soil increases in fertility as we advance from the seaboard, yet density of population is in a near ratio to proximity to the place of original settlement, on James river. If we make every just allowance for the space actually occupied by mountains, and other unproductive tracts, still there would remain at least 50,000 square miles, capable of sustaining a mean distributive population, equal in number to that which occupies any of the best inhabited of its existing counties, (for example, Henrico, including Richmond,) such a ratio, would give Virginia more than five millions of inhabitants,—a number far below the population she could support. The principal Towns are, Richmond, the seat of government, situated at the falls of James river, on a site or elevation perhaps not to be surpassed in beauty in the United States, having an extensive view of the river, and an open, well cultivated, and fertile country for many miles in extent; it contains 16,060 inhabitants. Norfolk, on Elizabeth river, which flows into Hampton Roads, had in 1830, a population of 9,816. Petersburg and Fredericksburg, at the falls of the Appomatox and Rappahannock, the first containing 8,300 inhabitants, and the last 3,308. Lynchburg, on James river, 120 miles above the falls, contains 4,630 inhabitants. Wheeling, on the Ohio, though only the fourth town in size and population, containing 5,211 inhabitants, is perhaps the most flourishing town in the state. Besides these—Winchester, Shepperdstown, Martinsburg, Staunton, Lexington and Fincastle, in the valley, Charleston, Abingdon and Brooke in the trans-Alleghany section deserve to be noticed—Williamsburg in the eastern section, and the ancient seat of government, is on the decline, but Charlottesville, near which the state University is located, has rapidly improved. The principal Rivers flowing into the Chesapeak bay, are, the Potomac, Rappahannock, York and James; all of which are large and navigable. The Shenandoah traces its quiet course down the valley, at the base of the Blue Ridge, and unites with the Potomac at Harper's Ferry. The Roanoke rises in the mountains, and passing into North Carolina, empties its waters into Albemarle sound. The Monongahela, and great Kenawha are both tributaries of the Ohio. Besides these, numerous other streams intersect the country in every direction; and render it inferior to few in facilities for transportation by water. The Chesapeake bay, one of the finest on the continent, extends 190 miles from its mouth, into the states of Virginia and Maryland; it is from 7 to 20 miles broad, and generally 9 fathoms deep. Geology and Mineralogy.—If we trace a line from the mouth of Potomac creek, through the Bowling Green and fork of the Pamunky, to Richmond,—thence through Petersburg and Hicksford, to the Roanoke near Weldon,—we shall embrace between it and the ocean, only tertiary, and alluvial formations. The soil contains oxides of iron, shells and marle, bones of sharks, whales, and other fish, carbonated wood, and other vegetable remains. From this line to the Blue Ridge, the formation may be regarded as essentially primitive; as most of the rocks are of that denomination. In this space however, two belts of transition and secondary formation have been found resting on the primitive rocks. One of these is the sand-stone and coal formation of the counties of Goochland, Powhatan, and Chesterfield; which is supposed to continue through the state, in a direction parallel to its mountains; the other, a narrow stratum of limestone, which has been found at the base of the South West mountains, at various points between the Potomac and James, and which yields in several of its quaries beautiful marble. In this primitive region, various valuable ores and pure metals have been discovered, among them iron ore in masses, and layers,— black lead,—copper, and gold. It is now well ascertained that a formation in which the latter metal is frequently found, commences near the Rappahannock in the county of Spottsylvania, and inclining with the mountains from N. E. to S. E. runs through Spottsylvania, Louisa, Fluvanna, and Goochland, to James river; and crossing this stream near the Point of fork, passes through Buckingham into North Carolina, and thence on to the Cherokee lands in Georgia. Many portions of this vein are extremely rich, and the purity is so extraordinary, the ore so near the surface, and the machinery necessary for its collection so cheap, that many individuals have engaged in the search. [For a more particular discription, see the several counties mentioned.] The dip of the rocks in this region is usually about 45°. West of the Blue Ridge, the country may be considered as divided by a line, sometimes corresponding with the Alleghany mountains, but in general running east of them; and south of the head waters of the Roanoke, stretching along the summits of the Bushy, Clinch, and Garden mountains. East of this line, the primitive rocks appear only at the tops of high ridges and mountains; the intervals between, and the sides of the mountains being in general transition, but sometimes secondary formations. Among the rocks of this region, are blue and gray limestone, slate, sandstone, gypsum, buhrstone, and conglomerate or pudding stone,—iron ore of the best quality is extensively distributed in this portion of the state, and valuable lead mines are worked in Wythe county, near Austinsville. The dip of the rocks is in this district less than in the primitive, but sometimes rises to 45°. West of this line described lies the great secondary formation of the state. The line of strata is more or less undulating, but in general nearly horizontal. This portion of the state abounds in mineral wealth. Bituminous coal, and iron ore are found almost everywhere;—beds of limestone are extensively distributed, and the caverns which abound in them furnish large quantities of nitre. The salt wells of the great Kenawha and Holston, are even superior to those of Onandagua, in New York; and new springs are every day developing themselves and being brought into operation, on the little Kenawha, and in other places. When greater facilities of transportation shall be given to this district of country, it may be confidently predicted that no portion of the United States will present greater rewards to industry and enterprize. Mineral Waters.—The Hydro-sulphurous springs of Virginia have been long celebrated. Perhaps they are surpassed in no portion of the earth for efficacy, in most of the cases which result from diseased action of the liver, or the stomach. They are known by the appellations of the Blue sulphur, White sulphur, Salt and Red sulphur springs, to which have been recently added, the Gray sulphur; and are situated, the two former in Greenbrier, at the foot of the western slope of the Alleghany,—and the three last in the county of Monroe. The Blue sulphur holds at least three active medicinal qualities in its composition; its tonic quality admirably sustains and husbands the debilitated system, while the alimentary canal and the glandular organs are efficiently operated upon, by its cathartic and deobstruent powers. The White sulphur acts, when taken in doses of two or three glasses at a time, as an alterative, exercising on the system much of the salutary influence, without the evil effects of mercury,—used in larger quantities it becomes actively diaretic and purgative. The Salt sulphur is more remarkable than the White, for the latter property; but not equal to it in the former. The Red sulphur, in addition to the qualities which it has in common with the last mentioned springs, is remarkable for its action on the pulse, which it reduces considerably in a short time: this property renders it highly valuable in pulmonary affections. The Sweet springs are situated on Potts' creek (a branch of James river) about 22 miles east of the Salt sulphur springs. They are of the class of waters called acidulous, and are valuable as a tonic in cases of debility, and in all the varieties of dyspepsia which are unaccompanied by inflammation. Their temperature is 4 about 73°. In the same range of mountains in which the Sweet springs are situated, and from 35 to 40 miles to the northeast are the thermal waters, known as the Warm and the Hot springs. The baths of the former are of the temperature of 96°, and are famed for relieving rhumatism, and various other complaints. The temperature of the latter, present every variety, from 51 to 107°, and are celebrated for their efficacy in cutaneous, rhumatic, dyspeptic, and liver complaints. Dr. Bell, in describing these springs observes,—all that has been performed by the Bristol, Buxton, and Bath waters in England, may be safely claimed as of easy accomplishment by the Virginia waters just enumerated. If to the Hot, Warm and Sweet springs,—We add the white, Salt, Red, and Blue Sulphur,—we may safely challenge any district of country of the same extent in the world to produce the same number and variety of valuable waters,—whether we have regard to their mineral impregnation or temperature, or the time in which they relieve entirely and permanently from a host of distressing maladies. Besides the above waters, there are various others of more or less value in Virginia. The springs at Bath, in Berkely county, have similar properties with the Sweet springs, and a temperature somewhat higher. In Botetourt, Montgomery, and Augusta there are also Hydro-sulphurous waters, similar in character to those in Greenbrier and Monroe, but of less efficacy. [See in the several counties named, a more particular description of these springs.] It is astonishing that these waters should, as long as their value has been known, never have been accurately analyzed; until the summer of 1834, Professor Rogers of William and Mary college analyzed the Warm spring water, the result of which may be seen under the head of Bath county. Scenery and Natural Curiosities.—The scenery of Virginia is in general highly picturesque. Without possessing the combination of highland and water prospect, which gives such a charm to the shores of the Hudson, or the soft lake scenery of the interior of New York; she surpasses even that state in the beauty of her vallies, and the grandeur of her mountains. The James and Kanawha vallies, offer at many points, in the bold outlines of their hills, and their broad and fertile low-lands, images which remind the traveller of the rich scenery of the Loire and the Garonne, The mountains of the state are strikingly distinguished, not only by an ever-varying succession of hill and dale, but by the beauty of their covering; their vigorous growth of oak, chesnut and lynn, contrasting advantagiously with the mountain districts of the northern and eastern states. The Curiosities of Virginia, present to the traveller, objects of yet deeper interest than her scenery. Among them may be enumerated:—the passage of the Potomac, through the Blue Ridge, so happily described by Mr. Jefferson,—that of James river through the same mountain;—the cliffs of New river, which present for a distance of 20 miles, a succession of sublime scenery—rivalled in our country only by that of Niagara, between the falls and Queenstown;—the celebrated Natural Bridge of Rockbridge, and the natural Tunnell of Scott county, "the most sublime of nature's works,"—the various medicinal springs already noticed,—and the burning springs of Kanawha. The blowing cave at the Panther's Gap in Rockbridge, admits perpetually a strong current of air. Other extensive and beautiful caverns exist in the limestone districts of the state; of the latter, two surpass the rest in beauty and interest,—the one called Weyer's cave, from its discoverer,—the other Allen's cave,—the former is situated in Augusta, near the little village of Port Republic,—the latter is situated in Shenandoah county, a short distance from Front Royall, on the right bank of the Shenandoah, about a quarter of a mile from the river, and is said to surpass Weyer's in the grandeur and beauty of its chambers. The description given by Goldsmith of the grotto of Antiparos seems almost literally to apply to these interesting works of nature; Weyer's cave penetrates to a distance of 2700 feet; and Allens 1200; presenting a series of lofty passages, and spacious apartments, encrusted with chrystals, and glittering with beautiful stalactites, exhibiting some of nature's wildest and most beautiful fantasies. We feel in traversing these magnificient apartments, as if we were visiting some of those enchanted palaces in which of old the Knights of chivalry were spellbound, or gazing on the bright visions, and revelling in the beautiful scenes conjured up by the magic of eastern fancy. A cave on Jackson's river, near Covington, is said to be much more extensive and intricate than those mentioned, but not so beautiful. In Montgomery county on the north bank of New river, 1¼ miles from Newbern, is situated what is called the Glass Windows; a great curiosity, which presents the spectator with a scene almost as magnificient as the natural bridge. The Falling Water, in Berkely county, and Falling Spring, in Bath, are two beautiful cataracts,—the first is situated on the bank of the Potomac, 6 miles north east from Martinsburg, and falls over a large alluvial rock, which rises 200 feet above the surface of the river,—the latter rises in the Warm Spring mountains, about 20 miles south west of the Warm springs, and about three quarters of a mile from its source, falls over a rock more than 200 feet above the valley below. The ebbing and flowing springs of Bath and Washington counties, may be mentioned as great natural curiosities,—the former situated in the valley of the Cow Pasture river, 16 miles north east of the Warm springs; it ebbs and flows to a remarkable extent—affording when the tide is full, sufficient water for a gristmill,—when at ebb, only supplying a tanyard and a distillery; the water is of the purest and best quality, and equal in the hottest seasons to the temperature of ice-water. The Ice-mountain and Ice-cave, in Hampshire county are very remarkable. On the north west side of the mountain, the surface is covered with loose stones, which being removed to the depth of three feet, an abundance of ice may be found at all seasons of the year. The Ice Cave, is situated near the top of a hill, nearly 1000 feet high—affords an abundant supply of excellent ice throughout the year. The most remarkable cataract in the State, is the Falling Spring, in Alleghany county. The stream has sufficient power, a few yards from its source, to turn a mill wheel, and about a mile below, it has a perpendicular descent of 200 feet, over a precipice of calcareous rock; before it reaches the bottom, it is almost converted into vapour, and the temperature is considerably reduced; the stream unites with Jackson's river, about a mile below the cataract. The Salt Pond lake, in Giles' county, not having been described in any account of the state, deserves to be noticed. It presents the curious spectacle of a beautiful sheet of water, about three miles in circumference, and a 100 fathoms deep, on the summit of a lofty mountain. Some of the aged people in the neighborhood, remember when its bottom was a spot of marshy ground, covered with pine and oak timber, and much frequented by deer and elk in pursuit, as was supposed, of salt. In process of time, a small pond was formed in the centre,—encreasing slowly at first, untill a stream which flowed out high on the mountain, suddenly ceased, and then rapidly rising above the tops of the trees, and finally to the top of the mountain, which it overflows at an angle below the general level. The water is entirely fresh, and abounds with lizards, but has no fish, The idea which prevails of its alternate rise and fall is erroneous; it is 3700 feet above the Ocean. Lake Drummond, in the Dismal Swamp, is about 7 miles in extent, and varies from 10 to 20 feet deep; it is about 24 feet above tide water; and in times of drought, the only feeder to the Dismal Smamp canal. Its waters are cool, and strongly impregnated with juniper, but pleasent to drink. Our limits will not permit us to notice the carved or calico rock of Kanawha, and various other curiosities of the state, which merit description but some account of them will be found in the several counties in which they are located.* * Note —The following interesting letter, on the mineral wealth of Virginia, was addressed to the Hon John Floyd, whilst Governor of Virginia. "I have recently returned from a geological excursion in Virginia. I entered the state near the head waters of the Potomac, passed thence to Winchester, followed the course of that fine Valley to the Natural Bridge; retracting my steps, I turned westwardly at Staunton, crossed the mountain at Jennings' Gap, and visited the justly celebrated medicinal springs in that region, returning, I went from Staunton through Charlottesville to Richmond, and down the James to its mouth. When this tour is taken in connection with a former visit to Wheeling, it will be conceded that I have seen enough of the state to enable me to form a rough estimate of its geological and mineralogical importance and I do assure you sir, that although my anticipations were far from being meagre, I was astonished at the vastness and variety of interesting objects in that department of natural history, that were constantly developing themselves, inviting the mind of man to reflection, and his hand to industry, and displaying at every step the wisdom and benificence of the Great Creater. I determined upon respectfully suggesting to your excellency, the expediency of a topographical, geological, mineralogical, and orgetological survey of Virginia. Should the enlightened representatives of the freemen of your state concur in this opinion, it will redound to the honor of all concerned, by the encouragement it will give to the study of the natural sciences—by the enhancement in the value of land in the interior, thereby enriching the state and its citizens, and giving a very proper check to unnatural migrations to the extreme west—by bringing to light and usefulness innumerable valuable crude materials,—thereby not only enlarging the field of manufactures and the useful arts, but furnishing carrying for the canals and roads already constructed, and assisting in new internal improvements in locations of equal importance. That I may not appear to be too enthusiastic, pardon me for pointing out some of the most obvious features in the geology of Virginia. Whether we consider the comfort and convenience of our species, or the industry and prosperity of a state, there is no mineral production that can outvie in importance with that of coal. In this country, where we have hitherto always had a superabundance of fuel, owing to the vast extent of our natural forests, the importance of a constant and abundant supply is not felt, and we are too apt to neglect properly to appreciate its value; but it is not so elsewhere—and a moment's reflection will shew that it ought not to be so here. Without fuel, of what use would be to us the metallic ores? For instance iron, which is now moulted, drawn and worked into thousands and tens of thousands of useful instruments, from a knife, to the complicated machinery of a steam ingine, would forever remain an indissoluble and useless mass of matter without the aid of fuel. Even the steam engine itself, that colossus of modern machinery, without the assistance of fire would be inactive and impotent. Where is the state in this Union? I might perhaps safely ask, where is the country in the world, that can surpass Virginia in the variety of position and abundance of supply of this valuable combustible? She possesses, not only in common with her sister states, a liberal quantity of bituminous coal in her western and carbonaceous regions—where, according to geological calculations, bituminous coal might be reasonably expected to be found, but in the eastern division of the state, within a few miles of the tidewater of a majestic stream which empties its ample waters into the Atlantic Ocean—in a geological position where bituminous coal never would have been sought after, because bituminous coal could not there have ever been expected to have been found, bituminous coal of a good quality, and apparently in great abundance has been found,—nature seeming, as it were, in this instance, to enable her to favor an otherwise highly favored land—to have defined all her own rules, and baffled the skill of the gravest geologist, by depositing bituminous coal upon the naked and barren bosom of the uncarbonaceous granite! I have often wondered why this anomaly did not strike the capacious and highly gifted mind of Jefferson; and why he, or some other of the many reflecting men of Virginia, was not led by it to inquire, what else there might be in store for the good people of that state? By neglecting to seek for them, we ungratfully reject the proffered kindness of our Creater; the laws of inanimate matter are, in this respect, in unision with those that govern animated nature we are furnished with the material and means, but in order to stimulate us to useful and healthful industry, we must labor in their appropriation. God gives us the earth and the seed, but we must plough and sow, or we can never reap; so he has bountifully placed within our reach innumerable valuable rocks, minerals and combustibles; but to enjoy them, we must delve into the bowels of the earth—and having found them, we must by various laborious processes render them fit for our use. To those who are accustomed to regard these things, it is difficult to determine which causes the most painful sensations, to observe how few coal mines, in comparison to what might be, are opened in the neighborhood of Richmond; or the want of skill exhibited in the selection and working of those recently opened. Nor is the deposite of the bituminous coal upon the granite, the only geological anomaly of this quarter. Proceeding from Charlottesville towards Richmond, almost immediately after you leave the talcose formation of the Blue Ridge, you are astonished at the fertility of the soil. You can scarcely persuade yourself that you are travelling over a country of primitive rocks. Soon however you discover that the fertility is not universal, but confined to patches of a brick red covering, that overlay the disintegrated materials of the primordail formations, and upon seeking further into this curious matter, your surprise is not a little increased upon discovering that this brick-red covering owes its existence to the disintegration of a rock which, in most other places, is exceedingly slow to decompose—and which, when decomposed, forms a cold and inhospitable soil. It is the hornblende sienite. Here it is surcharged with iron, which oxidating by exposure to the atmosphere and moisture, the rock freely disintegrates, and the oxide of iron being set at liberty, imparts its coloring to the ground, and fertilizes the soil in an extraordinary degree. Next in geological and statistical importance, I would place the mineral springs of Virginia, and those would form a legitimate subject of investigation to those who should be appointed to conduct a geological survey. I am not aware of any portion of country of the same extent, possessing an equal number and variety of mineral springs as the counties of Bath, Greenbrier and Monroe. This is a subject upon which one might easily compose a book, but I must confine myself to a few lines. The waters are thermal and cold; the former of various degrees of intensity. They hold in solution a variety of metals, earths, acids, and alkalies, combined in various proportions, and suited to relieve the sufferings of invalids from a number of diseases. Mineral springs of less interest than these have excited the attention of the learned in almost every age and country; and Virginia owes it to her high mental standing, independently of every other consideration, to assist the cause of science by investigating the causes of the high temperature, and making accurate analysis of these valuable waters. It is the duty of states, as it is of individuals, to furnish their quota to the general stock of information; and this is peculiarly the duty of a republican state, whose happiness, nay, whose very political existence depends upon an improved state of the minds of its citizens. Mr. John Mason Good, in his "Book of Nature," after describing the barren state of society in the middle ages, says. "We have thus rapidly travelled over a wide and dreary desert, that like the sandy wastes of Africa, has seldom been found refreshed by spots of verdure; and what is the moral? That ignorance is ever associated with wretchedness and vice, and knowledge with happiness and virtue. Their connections are indissoluble, they are woven in the very texture of things, and constitute the only substantial difference between man and man," and I would add between state and state. Has the heat of these waters any connexion with volcanic phenomena? or is the temperature entirely chemical, originating in the decomposition of sulphuret of iron, as I suggested some years ago, in a paper published upon the subject? At the Hot Springs, the hot sulphur water and the cold pure water issue out of the calcareous rock at the base of the Warm Spring mountain, within a few feet of each other. One of these Virginia springs makes a copious deposite of calcareous tufa, and at another, you perceive newly formed chrystals of sulphate of iron. The White Sulphur Spring takes its name from a rich white deposite, and the Red Sulphur from one of that color. If this is not an uncommon and a highly interesting section of country, calling aloud for investigation, and meriting legislative inteference, then have I taken an entirely erroneous view of the subject. The Warm Spring mountain is white sandstone. The rocks of the Valley of the Hot Springs are calcareous, argillaceous and siliceous. They are all nearly vertical. At first the two former, and afterwards the two latter alternate. They have all been deposited in a horizontal position, and between their narrow strata are thin layers of clay, covering organic remains * * * * * * The mountain ranges of Virginia are more numerous, and the Valleys consequently narrower than they are in Pennsylvania, but some of them are very interesting. The great Valley, as it is sometimes called, or par excellence, the Valley, situate between the Blue Ridge and the North and Alleghany mountain, is by far the most extensive. The rocks often obtrude, rendering the soil rather scanty—but nevertheless this is a fine district of country. I could find no fossils in this rock. In regard to the metallic ores I would observe, that I discovered sufficient indications of their existing in Virginia in quantity sufficient to justify a more accurate examination. Iron abounds in almost every part of the western section of the state, traces of copper, lead, manganese and chrome, have also been discovered near the Blue Rridge, and the gold of Orange county is equal to any found in the Carolinas or Georgia. I have never seen any thing that exceeds the richness and variety of coloring of the serpentine of the Blue Ridge. This mineral is easily cut, and the fineness and closeness of the grain render it susceptible of a high polish at Zoblitz, in Saxony, several hundred persons are employed in its manufacture. Besides the minerals belonging to the talcose formation, and generally accompanying serpentine, are many of them valuable in the arts; for instance, steatite (soap stone,) talc, chromate of iron, clorite of slate, and native magnesia. A geological survey would most probably lead to the discovery of most of these minerals. I could make large additions to this communication, but for the fear of traspassing upon your patience. I will therefore close my observations with noticing two instances of a want of confidence in the mineral productions of your own state, which I am persuaded that a geological survey would tend to correct. I met many wagons loaded with sulphate of lime (gypsum) from Nova Scotia, being taken to the interior to be used as a manure, but I did not see one wagon employed to bring carbonate of lime (common lime stone) from the inexhaustible quarries of the great Valley to any other district to be used for the same purpose. In the beautiful and flourishing city of Richmond, I observed the fronts of two stores fitting up in the new and fashionable style with granite (so called) (sienite) from Massachusetts, while there exists in the James river and on its banks, in the immediate vicinity of the town, rocks of a superior quality, in quantities amply sufficient to build a dozen cities. I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servent, PETER A. BROWNE. MOUNTAINS. Having taken a general survey of the whole of Virginia, we will now give a more particular description of her mountain ranges, and the courses of her streams. Our mountains are not scattered confusedly in groups, or in solitude over the surface of the country; but are disposed in massive ridges, commencing about 180 miles from the coast, and running parallel with it, in a S. W. direction. The first continuous chain derives its name from the deep blue colour by which it is distinguished. The North Mountains are from 20 to 30 miles farther west, and these are succeeded by the great Appalachian or Alleghany range, which divides the eastern and western waters. The Appalachian system presents its widest base in Virginia, and if we include its various lateral ridges, occupies a superficies of nearly one hundred miles in breadth, nearly all of which is covered with mountains and vallies. In the same direction generally are the veins of limestone, coal, and other minerals, and the falls of the rivers. James and Potomac rivers penetrate through all the ranges east of the Alleghany;—that is broken by no water course, and is in fact the spine of the country between the Atlantic on one side, and the Mississippi, and St. Lawrence on the other. The passage of the Potomac through the Blue Ridge has been said to be perhaps one of the most stupendous scenes in nature. You stand on a very high point of land,—on your right comes the Shenandoah, having ranged along the foot of the mountains for a 100 miles in search of a vent,— on your left approaches the Potomac, also in quest of a passage,—at the moment of their junction they rush together through the mountain and pass to the sea. The first glance of the scene hurries us into the belief that the mountains were created before the rivers, that in this place the latter were dammed up by the former, and made a lake, which covered a considerable portion of the valley,—that continuing to rise, they at length burst through at the spot, and tore asunder the mountain from its summit to its base. The piles of rock on each side, but especially on that of the Shenandoah, bear evident marks of rupture and avulsion from their beds, by some powerful force. The distant finishing which nature has given to the picture is of a very different character; and a perfect contrast to the fore-ground. The former is as placid and delightful as the latter is wild and tremendous. You see through the rough and horrid cleft, a clear and beautiful view of level and fertile country, bounded only by the limits of human vision. The height of our mountains has not yet been estimated with any degree of exactness. There is no doubt but the Alleghany, as it is the dividing ridge for the waters, is more elevated above the ocean than the rest; but its relative height, estimated from the base on which it stands, will not compare with that of some of its kindred ranges;—the country rising a considerable step behind each range. It has been before stated that the Peaks of Otter, in the Blue Ridge, were supposed until lately to be the highest points measured from their base, in North America; but it has since been ascertained that the White Top Peaks of the Iron mountains are still more elevated. The highest peak of the latter is only about 4,260 feet above the Atlantic ocean,—which is not one fifth part of the height of the mountains of South America, or one third of the height which would be necessary in our latitude, to preserve ice unmelted in the open air throughout the year. The range of mountains next beyond the Blue Ridge, which we call the North Mountain, received the name of Endless mountain from the Indians, on account of its great extent. Alleghany mountain of the Appalachian system. It is an unanswerable objection to giving the name of Alleghany to the whole system, that it has been appropriated to a particular chain in Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia. From the basin of the Kanawha, to that of the western branch of the Susquehannah, through 4° of latitude, the Alleghany is a dividing ridge between the waters flowing into the Atlantic, from those of the Ohio, giving source, eastward to the branches of James river and the Potomac and on the other side, or weastward to those of the Kanawha, Monongahela, Youghioghany and Kiskiminitas. The ridges which form the particular chain of the Alleghany, are not very distinctly defined, though the entire chain constitutes so remarkable a feature in the geography of the United States. The length of the Alleghany is, from Monroe county, in Virginia, in the valley of the Kanawha, to Centre county, in Pennsylvania, in the valley of Susquehannah, 300 miles. The height varies, but may be stated at 2500 feet, as a mean. Similar to all other chains of the Appalachian system, that of Alleghany does not rise into peaks, but stretches in parallel ridges, which, to the view from either side, presents gentle rounded, and swelling knolls, or elegantly defined lines, which bound the distant horizon. The component material of the Alleghany, is mostly graywake, though limestone and other rocks occasionally occur. This chain is rich in iron and bituminous coal. Some ridges have naked summits, but this feature is rare, the ridges generally being clothed with timber in all their height. A few mountain planes with tolerable soil for agriculture occur, but mostly the soil is rocky and barren, and often marshy. Pine and oak the most abundant timber. Appalachian System.—The name given to the immense chain extending along the whole Atlantic course of the United States, from Alabama to Maine. In the southern states they are 200 miles from the sea, but to the north they approach near the coast. They run generally in parallel ridges, and the various divisions go by different names. In Tennessee they are called the Cumberland Mountains,—in Virginia—Blue Ridge,—in Pennsylvania the Alleghany and Laurel Mountains,—in New York,—the Catskill,—in Vermont the Green Mountains, and in New Hampshire,—the White Mountains. They are sometimes broken into groups and isolated chains. Their highest summits are in New Hampshire, and between 6 and 7000 feet above the level of the sea. East of the Hudson they are of granite formation. In the west and south they consist of granite, gneis, mica, clay-state, primitive limestone, &amp;c. Blue Mountain.—This undistinguishing term has been applied to several chains of the Appalachian system in the United States, but more particularly to that one called by some tribes of Indians "Kaatatin Chunk," or Endless Mountain. If we turn our attention to the Appalachian chain we find them often only interrupted, where a cursory survey would lead us to place a termination. Whether the Kittatinny Chain or "Blue Mountain" could be detected eastward from the Hudson we are unprepared to determine, but westward of that river, this chain is found distinct in the Shawangunk, near Kingston, in Ulster county, New York. It thence ranges S. W., meets and turns Delaware river at the extreme northern angle of New Jersey, and continues its original direction to the Delaware Water Gap, where the mountain chain is traversed by the river, and the former curves more to the westward, enters Pennsylvania, over which it ranges about 150 miles to the northern angle of Franklin county, after having been pierced by the Lehigh, Schuylkill, and Susquehannah rivers. Between Franklin and Bedford counties the Kittatinny reassumes nearly its original direction in the state of New York, and though in some places confounded with the Alleghany, really continues a distinct chain over Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina and Tennessee, into Alabama, S. W. of Susquehannah, the Kittatinny rises, and extending first nearly west, between the tributaries of Coredogwinet and Shoreman's rivers, is thence broken into ridges bounding on the west, the valley of Conecocheague, gradually curves to the souhward, and reaches Potomac, extending very little west of south. Rising again beyond the Potomac, between the Opequan and Black creeks, it runs nearly parallel with the Blue Ridge, is passed by the North Fork of Shenandoah, and extends thence between the two main branches of that river. Though scarcely appearing distinctly on our best maps, the chain of Kittatinny is completely distinct, and continues over Rockingham, Augusta and Rockbridge counties, Virginia, into Botetourt, to where it is traversed by James river, below the mouth of Craig's creek. Rising again beyond James river, the chain stretches along the higher sources of James and Roanoke rivers, to the centre of Montgomery county, near Christiansburg. Here it leaves the Atlantic slope, and merges into the valley of the Ohio, by entering the subvalley of New river or Upper Kanawha. Thus far, in all its range from the Hudson, the Kittatinny chain is broken into links by the higher sources of the Atlantic rivers, and similar to the Southeast Mountain and Blue Ridge, the base gradually rises, ascending the vast inclined plain obliquely, until it reaches the highest apex between the sources of Roanoke and those of Little river branch of New river. In this region the lowest gap through which measurements have been made for a projected canal, is 2049 feet above the level of the Atlantic ocean. The base of the chain now commences to depress and inflecting to a course considerably west of S. W., is traversed by New river or Upper Kanawha. Beyond the latter stream, under the Local name of Iron Mountain, and discharging to the eastward the tributaries of New river, and from the opposite flank those of the south branch of Holston and Watauga, it reaches the extreme N. E. angle of the Tennessee. At the latter point, the chain assumes a direction very nearly S. W., and under the various local names of Iron Mountain, Bald Mountain, Smoky Mountain and Unika Mountain, is pierced in succession by Watuga, Doe, Nolechucky, French, Broad, Big, Pigeon, Tennessee, Proper and Hiwasse rivers, and merges according to Tanner's map of the United States, into Blue Ridge, in the northern part of Georgia, between the sources of Coosa and Hiwassee rivers. If the whole body of the Kittatinny and its mean elevation is compared with the body and elevation of the Blue Rridge, the former exceeds in both respects, from the Hudson to their termination in Georgia, though at the high lands on the Hudson and in the Peaks of Otter, the Blue Ridge rises to a superior elvevation from their respective bases. As a distinct and defined chain the Kittatinny is upwards of eight hundred miles in length. The height above the ocean varies from 800 to 2,500 feet. All the ridges in their natural state were wooded to their summits, though the trees are generally stunted in growth at any considerable height. In the vallies along both flanks the timber is often very large and lofty; particularly the pines, oaks, hemlocks and liriodendron. On some of the ridges good arable soil is found on the summits, but sterility is the general character of the soil. Amongst the peculiar features of this chain, one may be remarked, which gives it a very distinct character. In all its length, it is no where strictly a dividing limit between river sources. Without assuming any connexion with the mountains eastward of the Hudson, the Kittatinny is pierced by the Delaware, Lehigh, Schuylkill, Susquehannah, Potomac and James rivers, flowing into the Atlantic ocean, and by the Great Kanawha, and various branches of Tennessee, flowing into the valley of the Ohio, or basin of the Mississippi. Blue Ridge.—Of the distinctive chains of the Appalachian system, and indeed of all the sections of this system, the Blue Ridge stands most apart and prominent, though of much narrower base, and of less mean elevation than either the Kittatinny or Alleghany. On a colored map of Virginia the Blue Ridge has a very striking appearance, arising from the fact of being a county limit in all its range over that state. Without tracing a probable but hypothetical identity, between the mountains of Massachusetts, 5 Connecticut and Vermont, with the Blue Ridge, we first meet this chain distinct at West Point on the Hudson river. Thence it rises into broken but continuous ridges over New York and New Jersey, to the Delaware, in a S. W. direction. Traversed by the Delaware immediately below the influx of Lehigh, and inflecting similar to the Kittatinny, to S. W. by W., it is pierced by the Schuylkill at Reading, by the Susquehannah below the mouth of Swatara, by the Potomac at Harper's Ferry, by James river, between Bedford and Amherst counties, Virginia, and by the Roanoke between Bedford and Franklin counties in the same state. In its further progress S. W. from Roanoke, the Blue Ridge becomes the limit of river source to its final extinction in Alabama. The length of this chain from the Hudson to Roanoke, is 450 miles, and from Roanoke to where it ceases to be a distinct chain in Alabama, 350 miles, having an entire length of 800 miles S. W. from the Hudson. The Hudson does not, however, terminate the Blue Ridge to the N. E. Many river passages through mountains have been noticed and celebrated, and, among others, the passage of this chain by the Potomac at Harper's Ferry, but it may be doubted whether from all the attendent circumstances, any similar phenomenon on earth combines so many very remarkable features as the passage of the tide stream of the Hudson through the two chains, the S. E. Mountain and Blue Ridge. Profoundly deep, far below the utmost draught of the largest vessels of war, the flux and reflux of the tides rush along a narrow and tortuous channel, on both sides bounded by enormous craggy and almost perpendicular walls of rock, rising from one thousand to twelve or fifteen hundred feet above the water surface. Sailing along this astonishing gorge the mind involuntarily demands by what operation of nature has this complication of wonders been produced? Again, what in an eminent degree enhances the surprise and admiration, is the fact, that this great river pass is made directly through a mountain nucleus. In all the chains of the Appalachian system, masses rise at different places, far beyond the ordinary height, and spreading much wider than the mean base of the chain in which they occur. The Peaks of Otter—the Peaks in the Catsbergs, in Windham, Green county, New York, several peaks of the Green mountains in Vermont, and above all, the White mountains of New Hampshire, are examples. The Highlands, pierced by the Hudson, and passed by the tide from the ocean, are however, every thing considered, by much the most remarkable of these mountain peaks or groups to be found, not only in the United States, but probably on this planet. Receding from the highlands, either to the S. W. or N. E. the chain depresses so much, that on our maps, the continuity in either direction, is generally not represented. There is, nevertheless, in the vicinity of the Hudson, no real interruption of either the South Mountains, or Blue Ridge, along their direction. The highest peaks being in the Blue Ridge on both sides of the river. Of these peaks, the highest is Butter Hill, which rises 1,535 feet above the ocean tides, and rising abruptly from the water, affords a very fine and extended landscape to the N. W. and W. After leaving the Hudson, Blue Ridge continues to N. E. about 20 miles, and then, similar to other chains of the same system on both sides of that river, rapidly inflects to a course a very little north of east, a direction which it maintains above 250 miles in the states of New York, Massachusetts and Vermont. For the first 70 miles of its northerly course, the Blue Ridge discharges from its eastern flank numerous branches of Housatonic, and from the opposing slope, Fishkill, Wappingers, Jansen's or Ancram and Kinderhook creeks, flowing westward into the Hudson. With the sources of Housatonic and Hoosack rivers, the features of Blue Ridge change; hitherto from the Hudson, a line of river sources, it now looses that character, and is broken into innumerable ridges by the higher sources of Hoosack and Batten Kill, flowing into the Hudson, and thence by those of Paulet, Otter, Onion, La Moille and Missisque rivers, falling into lake Champlain. All these latter streams rise in the S. E. mountain, and flowing down a western slope pass the Blue Ridge. A hypothesis may be hazarded, that what is designated Green mountains in the sourthern part of Vermont, and the ridge or series of ridges, known by the same term in the northern part of the same state, are fragments of two separate chains, though generally represented as the continuation of one and the same chain. Regarding the great western chain, east of the Hudson, in the state of New York, Massachusetts and Vermont, as the continuation of Blue Ridge, the whole length of the chain in the United States, exceeds 1,000 miles. In relative elevation, the Blue Ridge is humble, though in one part, Bedford county, Virginia, the peaks of Otter rise to 4,200 feet above tide water. Generally, the ridges are from 700 to 1,000 feet above their bases, and the base rising with the mountain, when the ridges are seen from the elevated table land, from which flow Roanoke, Kanawha, Yadkin and Tennessee, they are, in fact, less imposing than when seen from the Hudson, Delaware, Susquehannah, Potomac or James rivers, though at the former region, the real oceanic elevation is more than double what it is near the more northern rivers. From its prominence, and southwestwardly from the Hudson, its isolation, Blue Ridge has been, though very erroneously, regarded and delineated as the extreme southeastern chain of the system; in reality, however, it is the third distinct chain advancing from the Atlantic ocean. Cumberland Mountain is a chain of the Appalachian system, and continues under this name through Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee and part of Alabama; whilst it is known in Pennsylvania as the Laurel chain. This mountain though not so delineated on our maps, is continuous from Steuben county, in New York, to Jackson, Morgan and Blunt counties in Alabama,—along an inflected line of 800 miles. About the extreme eastern angle of Kentucky, and S. W. of the Great Sandy, this chain becomes distinctly known as the Cumberland mountain, and ranging S. W. seperates Virginia from Kentucky; as far as Cumberland Gap, on the northern boundary of Tennessee, continuing S. W., but with an inflection to the N. W. this chain stretches over Tennessee,—dividing in its course the waters of the Cumberland from those of Tennessee river, entering Alabama, and crossing Tennessee river at its great bend, it gradually disappears among the sources of the Black Warrior river. The Cumberland chain is in no part very elevated,—ranging from 800 to 1,000 feet above the level of the tide; but though humble as to relative height, it maintains otherwise all the distinctive characters of the other Appalachian chains; extending in long, regular and often lateral ridges, passable only at long intervals where gaps occur, or where it is traversed by rivers. The ridges are wooded to the summit. Kittatinny Mountains, an extensive and important chain of the Appalachian system. In Pennsylvania the Kittatinny is very definite, and with an intervening valley between their ranges, parallel to the Blue Ridge. It is the same chain, however, which first becomes definite in the state of New York, west of the Hudson, and there known as the Shawangunk, and extending S. W. over the upper part of New Jersey, enters Pennsylvania at the Delaware Water gap. Thence inflecting to W. S. W., is traversed by the Lehigh at the Lehigh Water gap, by the Schuylkill above Hamburg, and by the Susquehannah, five miles above Harrisburg. From the latter point the chain again inflects still more to the westward, between Cumberland and Perry counties. At the western extremity of those two counties, the chain abruptly bends to a nearly southern course, between Franklin and Bedford counties, enters Maryland, by the name of Cove mountain, being traversed by the Potomac river, between Williamsport and Hancockstown, and stretches into Virginia, as the Great North mountains, over Virginia, from the Potomac to James river, between Rockbridge and Alleghany counties. This chain though broken, remains distinct, a similar character prevails from James river to New river, between Wythe and Grayson counties. After being traversed by New river, the chain again assumes complete distinctness, leaves Virginia, and under the local name of Iron mountains, Bald mountains, Smoky mountains and Unika mountains, separates North Carolina and Tennessee, to the Unika turnpike on the western border of Macon county, of the former state. Thence continuing a little W. of S. W., crosses the N. W. angle of Georgia, enters Alabama, and separating the sources of the creeks of Middle Tennessee river, from those of Coosa, merges into the hills from which rise the numerous branches of Tuscaloosa. Thus, defectively as the Kittatinny, called expressly by the Indians Kataatin Chunk, or the Endless mountains, are delineated on our maps, it is in nature a prominent and individual chain, from N. lat 34° 31′ to 41° 30′, and 2° 45′ E to 10° W long, Washington city. Ranging through 7° of lat. and almost 13° of long., stretching along a space exceeding 900 statute miles, and varying in distance from the Blue Ridge, between 15 to 25 miles, generally about 20, though in some places the two chains approach, as at Harrisburg, to within less than 10 miles from each other. In relative height the Kittatinny exceeds the Blue Ridge, but as regards the plain or table land on which they both stand, it rises gradually from tide water in Hudson river, to an elevation of 2,500 feet in Ashe county, of North Carolina. From James river to the Hudson, the chain ranges along the Atlantic slope, and is broken by streams flowing through it on their course towards the Atlantic ocean, but passing the higher valley of James river, the Kittatinny winds over the real dividing line of the waters, and is thence traversed by New river, Watauga, Nolechucky, French Broad and Tennessee rivers. Kittatinny Valley, in the most extended sense of the term, is in length commensurate with the mountain chain from which the name is derived; it therefore extends from Hudson river to the northern part of Alabama, varying in width from eight to 25 miles, with generally a substratum of limestone towards Blue Ridge, and of clay slate on the side of the Kittatinny. Some of the most flourishing agricultural districts of the United States, are included in this physical section. The county of Orange, in New York, Sussex and Warren, in New Jersey, are nearly all comprised within its limits. In Pennsylvania it embraces the greater part of the lower section of Northampton; nearly all Lehigh, Berks and Lebanon, the lower part of Dauphin, with the greater share of Cumberland and Franklin. In Maryland the eastern and left part of Washington. In Virginia, a large part of Berkley, Jefferson, Frederick, Shenandoah Rockingham, Augusta, Rockbridge, Botetourt, Montgomery and Grayson, and in North Carolina, the counties of Ashe, Buncombe, Haywood and Macon. The latitude and relative elevation of this great zone has already been shown in the preceding article, and the peculiar features of its parts may be seen under the respective heads of the counties it embraces, in whole or in part. Laurel Hill, or Laurel Mountain, is a local name given to several of the western chains of the Appalachian system, and leads of course to confusion. The chain in Pennsylvania extending from the Conemaugh to the Youghioghany river,—and which seperates Cambria county, from Westmorland, and Summerset from Westmorland and Fayette, is there called the Laurel Hill, whilst another chain ten miles further west, is called the Chesnut Ridge. Both these ridges continue out of Pennsylvania, and enter Virginia, S. W. of the Youghioghany; but the names are reversed, and the Chesnut Ridge of Pennsylvania is the Laurel Hill of Virginia. Such is the wretched delineation of the Appalachian system, on all of our maps, that no adequate idea of the respective chains, can, in many instances, be obtained from them. The two chains mentioned in this article, though not so represented, preserve their identity, in a manner similar to the Blue Ridge, from New York to Alabama. BAYS, HARBOURS, RIVERS, SWAMPS, &amp;c. To complete our view of Natural Virginia, we have only to consider her waters these for convenience we shall arrange as we have the mountains, in alphabetical order. Albemarle Sound belongs to North Carolina, but as it is intimately connected with some of the waters of Virginia, we will notice it,—It is an estuary of the Roanoke and Chowan rivers, extending 60 miles in length from east to west, along N. lat 36°, with a mean breadth of eight miles, but protruding several deep minor bays. The Roanoke enters from the west, and the Chowan from the N. W. at the extreme interior of Albemarle, which spreads below the entrance of those rivers in a shallow expanse of water, with a level, or rather a flat, country along each shore. Every small inlet has its own comparative broad bay, by one of which, the Pasquotank, a navigable inland communication by the Dismal Swamp canal, has been formed between Albemarle sound and Chesapeake bay. Albemarle sound is separated from the Atlantic ocean, by long, low, and narrow reefs of sand; but having two channels of connexion southward with Pamlico sound, one on each side of the Roanoke Island, and on the northward an opening to the ocean by Currituck sound and inlet; both rivers are navigable to near their sources. The climate of this basin differs very much between its extremes, both from difference of latitude and of level. The latitude differs near 3¼ degrees, and the level not less than 1000 feet, giving an entire difference of temperature of upwards of 5 degrees of latitude. The vegetable productions, both natural and exotic, have a corresponding variety with the extent of climate. On this basin, near the mouth, the orange and sugar cane are cultivated, and on its higher branches, the apple, and wheat, rye, oats, and other cerealia. The staple vegetable, however, both on the interior and islands contiguous to this basin, is cotton, though admitting a very wide range of staple, such as tobacco, indigo, &amp;c. Rice is extensively cultivated. Appomatox river rises in Buckingham and Prince Edward counties, and flows thence by a very crooked channel, but by a general eastern course, with the counties of Prince Edward, Amelia, Dinwiddie, and Prince George, on the right, and Buckingham, Cumberland, Powhatan, and Chesterfield on the left, and falls into James river after a comparative course of 90 miles. The tide ascends the Appomattox, to the falls of Petersburg, about 20 miles above the mouth, and thus far contains depth of water for large merchant vessels. This stream drains a very fine section of Virginia, between lat. 37° 33′ and 37° 26′ north. It may be navigated as far as Broadway's, by any vessel which has crossed Harrison's bar, in James river, and has eight or nine feet water a few miles higher up to Fisher's bar; and by late improvements it contains seven feet water to Petersburg, where navigation ceases. Bannister river rises by numerous branches in Pittsylvania county, and flowing twenty-five miles in a N. E. direction, enters Halifax county, and inflects to the S. E. about 30 miles, and falls into Dan river about ten miles above the junction of the latter with the Roanoke. Bannister drains most part of the peninsula between Dan and Roanoke rivers, below the eastern boundary of Henry and Franklin counties. Big Sandy, mentioned before as Great Sandy river, has its most remote sources in the north western slopes of Clinch mountain, but receives tributaries from a distance of 70 miles, along the upper parts of Russell, Tazewell, and Logan counties. The eastern or main branch rises in Logan and Tazewell, but the higher streams uniting, the main channel becomes, for a distance of 30 miles, a line of demarcation between those two counties, to where it passes Cumberland mountain. From the latter point to its influx into the Ohio, the channel of Big Sandy separates Kentucky from Virginia, flowing between Logan and Cabell of the latter, and Floyd, Lawrence, and Greenup of the former state. The main or eastern branch of Big Sandy has interlocking sources with those of Guyandot, Blue-stone, a branch of Great Kanawha, Clinch branch of Tennesse, and its own West Fork. The West Fork of Sandy rises in Russell county, flows thence westward, traverses Cumberland mountain, and enters Pike county, Kentucky. Passing over Pike into Floyd in the original direction, the channel curves to northward, and unites with the eastern branch between Lawrence of Kentucky, and Cabell of Virginia. The valley of Big Sandy is in its greatest length from S. S. E. to N. N. W. about 100 miles, with a mean breadth of about 30, area 3000 square miles; bounded to the westward by the vallies of Kentucky and Licking rivers, to the northeastward by that of Guyandot, and eastward by that of New river, or the upper waters of Great Kanawha. The main stream enters the Ohio at Catlettsburgh in Greenup county, Kentucky, and opposite to the extreme southern angle of the state of Ohio, N. lat 38° 24′ and long 5° 33′ west of Washington. Blackwater river has its extreme source in Prince George county, and within 8 or 10 miles southward from the influx of Appomatox into James river. Flowing thence southeastward over Surry and Sussex, it inflects to the southward and separating Southampton on the right from Isle of Wight, and Nansemond on the left, falls into the Nottoway river very nearly on the border between Virginia and North Carolina, after a comparative course of 70 miles. Blue-stone, a small river in Tazewell and Giles counties, which rises in the latter, and interlocking sources with those of Clinch and Big Sandy, flows thence N. E. down a mountain valley into New river, which it enters about five miles above the influx of Greenbrier. Cheat river, a considerable branch of the Monongahela, rises on the border of Randolph and Pocahontas counties, interlocks with Elk and Greenbrier branches of the Great Kanawha, and after uniting with the south branch of the Potomac, flows thence by a general northern course 70 miles, over Randolph into Preston county, inflecting in the latter county to N. N. W. forty miles to its junction with the Monongahela, at the S. W. angle of Fayette county, Pennsylvania. The valley of Cheat lies between those of Monongahela on the west, Potomac east, and Youghioghany east. The length of this valley is about 100 miles, mean breadth not more than 18, and its area about 1800 square miles. Cheat river is 200 yards wide at its mouth, and 100 yards at the Dunkard's settlement,—it is navigable 60 miles higher for boats, except in dry seasons. The boundary between Virginia and Pennsylvania crosses it, three or four miles above its mouth. Chickahominy river rises between the vallies of the Pamunkey and James rivers, about 20 miles N. W. from Richmond; it flows thence S. E. by E.—having the counties of Henrico and Charles City on the right, and Hanover, New Kent, and James City counties on the left; it falls into James river after a comparative course of 60 miles. Chesapeake bay, a deep gulf, opening from the Atlantic ocean, between capes Henry and Charles; lat. 37° and long 1° east from Washington, intersecting in the mouth of the bay, near midway between the capes, which are about 15 miles asunder. The mouth of this fine sheet of water extends westward 20 miles to the mouth of James river. Curving rapidly, above the influx of James river, the Chesapeake extends almost directly north over one degree of latitude, with a mean breadth of 20 miles, having received from the westward James, York, Rappahannock, and Potomac rivers, and from the opposite side, Pocomoke and Nantikoke rivers. Widened by the union of so many tributaries, the Chesapeake is upwards of 40 miles wide from the mouth of the Potomac to that of Pocomoke, and about 35 from the most southern capes of the Potomac to the influx of Nantikoke river. Above the entrance of the two latter streams, the main bay narrows to a mean width of about 10 miles, and at some places under 5 miles, but with an elliptic curve to the westward 115 miles to its termination, at the mouth of Susquehannah river, having received from the westward above the Potomac, the Patuxent, Patapsco, Gunpowder and Bash rivers, and from the eastward Nantikoke, Choptank, St. Michaels, Chester, Sassafras and Elk rivers. The entire length of Chesapeake bay is 185 miles; and it may be doubted whether any other bay of the earth, is, in proportion to extent, so much diversified by confluent streams as is the Chesapeake. In strictness of geographical language, it is, however, only a continuation of Susquehannah river, of which primary stream all the other confluents of Chesapeake are branches. In the main bay the depth of water continues sufficient for the navigation of the largest ships of war to near the mouth of Susquehannah; and in Potomac that depth is preserved to Alexandria. In the other tributary rivers large vessels are arrested before reaching the head of tide water. If taken in its utmost extent, including the Susquehannah valley, the Chesapeake basin forms a great physical limit; to the S. W. with few exceptions, the rivers, bays and sounds, are shallow, and comparatively unnavigable; but with the Chesapeake commences deep harbors, which follow at no great distance from each other, to the utmost limits of the Atlantic coast of the United States. The entire surface drained into this immense reservoir amounts to near 70,000 square miles. We know of no place in which we can better introduce an article upon the Chesapeake Peninsula, a natural section of the United States, the peculiar features of which are generally lost or confused among the political subdivisions of our country. This physical section is bounded by the Atlantic ocean S. E., by Chesapeake bay W., by Delaware bay N. E. and united to the main continent by an isthmus, now traversed on the north by the Chesapeake and Delaware canal. That work has in fact insulated the peninsula, and given it water boundaries on all sides. Thus restricted, this peninsula extends from Cape Charles N. lat. 37° 8′ to the Chesapeake and Delaware canal at N. lat. 39° 32′. Greatest length very nearly in a direction north and south 182 miles. The general form is that of an elongated ellipse, which, in component material, features, and elevation, differs in nothing essential from the Atlantic islands scattered along the coast of the United States. Chesapeake bay is itself divided between Virginia and Maryland; the shores on both sides south of the Potomac and Pocomoke rivers belong to the former, and to the northward to the latter State. The southern part of the peninsula is entirely in Virginia, and is a long, narrow promontory, 70 miles, by 8 to 10 miles wide. Above Pocomoke bay the peninsula widens, and after an intermediate distance of 33 miles, is equally divided between the States of Maryland and Delaware. In the widest part, between Cape Henlopen, Sussex county, Delaware, and the western part of Talbot, Maryland, the width is 70 miles, but narrowing towards both extremes, the mean breath is about 27; area 4900 square miles. The surface is generally level or very gently undulating. The ocean and Chesapeake shores are strongly contrasted. Along the former, are narrow and low islands, with shallow sounds, and no stream issuing from the land of any consequence. The opposite shore of the Chesapeake is in an especial manner indented by innumerable bays, and compared with the confined width of the peninsula, rivers of great magnitude of volume. The character of the Atlantic is extended along the Delaware bay; and entirely round the peninsula, much of the soil is liable to diurnal or occasional submersion from the tides. The general slope is southwestward as demonstrated by the course of the rivers Pocomoke, Nantikoke, Choptank, Chester, Sassafras, and Elk. Politically it contains all Sussex, Kent, and more than one-half of New Castle county, of Delaware, all Worcester, Somerset, Dorchester, Talbot, Caroline, Queen Ann, and Kent, and one-third of Cecil county, of Maryland, with all Accomack and Northampton counties, of Virginia. Chowan river, is in North Carolina, but formed by the union of three streams of Virginia, the Meherin, Nottoway, and Blackwater rivers: The Meherin rises in Charlotte county, Virginia, 1° 30′ west from Washington City, lat 37°, between the vallies of Roanoke and Appomattox, and flowing thence S. E. by E. by comparative courses 80 miles, passes into North Carolina between Northampton and Gates counties, and 20 miles farther unites with the Nottoway, above Winton, between Gates and Hertford counties. The Nottoway derives its remote sources from Prince Edward county, Virginia, between those of Meherin and Appomatox. In a general eastern course of 70 miles, the Nottoway separates Lunenburg, Brunswick and Greensville counties from Nottoway, Dinwiddie and Sussex, and flows into the central parts of the latter. Thence inclining S. E. 40 miles it receives Blackwater river almost on the boundary line between Virginia and North Carolina. Below the junction of the Nottoway and Blackwater, the name of the former, and course of the latter, are preserved, and about 10 miles within North Carolina and in Gates county, meet the Meherin to form Chowan river. A tide water river, or more correctly a bay, the Chowan, gradually widens, but still retaining a moderate breadth, 25 miles to the influx of Bemer's creek, there bends to near a southern course and more rapidly widens for 25 miles to its junction with Roanoke, at the head of Albemarle sound. Lat. 36°, passes up Albemarle sound, and intersects the eastern point of Bertie county, North Carolina, between the mouths of Chowan and Roanoke, 0° 20′ long east of Washington City. Including all its tributaries, the Chowan drains an area of 3,500 square miles, which, as a physical section, comprises the northeastern part of the basin of Roanoke. As a commercial channel, the Chowan, Nottoway, and Blackwater extend almost directly from the mouth of Roanoke to that of James river. There is at all seasons sufficient depth of water to admit sloops of war to Murfreesboro' on Meherin, about 10 miles above the entrance of Nottoway river. Clinch river of Virginia and Tennessee, the great northeastern constituent of Tennessee river, rises in Tazewell county, Virginia, and flows thence by a general course of S. W. over Russell and Scott counties, 90 miles. Entering Tennessee, Clinch separates Claiborne county from Hawkins, Granger and Anderson, Campbell from Anderson, and thence traversing the latter, enters Roan, and unites with the Tennessee at Kingston, after an entire comparative course of 180 miles. In the south part of Campbell county Clinch receives from the N. E. Powell's river. The latter rising in Russell county, Virginia, issues thence in a direction almost parallel to the Clinch; traverses Lee county of Virginia, enters Tennessee, crossing Claiborne and Campbell counties, joins the Clinch at Grantsboro, after a comparative course of 90 miles. A short distance above its junction with Tennessee river, the Clinch receives from the N. W. Emery's river. It may be remarked that the course of the higher branches of Emery's river is directly the reverse of that of Clinch and Powell's river. Uniting the vallies of Emery's and Clinch river, the whole valley is about 220 miles long; but the width is contracted comparatively, and fully estimated at 20 miles; area 4400 square miles. In all their respective courses, Clinch and Holston pursue a parallel direction, in few places 20 miles asunder, each receiving short creeks, from an intervening mountain chain. On the opposite or right side, Clinch in succession interlocks sources with those of Great Sandy, Kentucky and Cumberland rivers. The relative elevation of the vallies of Clinch and Holston differ but little from each other, and each stream above their junction, must have, from their remote fountains, a fall of 1000 or 1200 feet. Coal river, in western Virginia, rises in Logan county by two branches, called relatively Great and Little Coal rivers. The former rises in the western spurs of the Appalachian ridges, flows N. W. out of Logan into Kanawha county, receives Little Coal river from the S. W. and finally falls into the right side of Great Kanawha and Guyandot rivers. [See Kan. co.] Craig's creek, or, more correctly, Craig's river, is the extreme S. W. tributary of James river, rises in Giles and Montgomery counties, Virginia, interlocking sources with a branch of Great Kanawha, and with the extreme higher sources of Roanoke; and flowing thence to the N. E. over Botetourt county, falls into James river after a comparative course of 40 miles. Cowpasture river, Virginia, rising in the mountain valley between the Kittatinny and Warm Spring mountain, interlocking sources with the south branch of Potomac, but flowing in an opposite direction S. S. W. falling into, or joining Jackson's river, to form James river, after a comparative course of 50 miles. Dismal Swamp. This remarkable swamp extends from north to south nearly thirty miles; and averages from east to west nearly ten; it lies partly in Virginia, and partly in North Carolina. Five navigable rivers, and some creeks rise in it; of the rivers, two flow into Virginia,—south branch of Elizabeth river, and south branch of Nansemond,—and three into North Carolina,—the North river, the North West river, and the Pequimonds. The sources of all of these streams are hidden in the swamp, and no traces of them appear above ground. From this it appears, that there must be plentiful subterraneous fountains to supply these streams,—or the soil must be filled perpetually with the water drained from the higher lands which surround it. The latter hypothesis is most probable, because the soil of the Swamp is a complete quagmire, trembling under the feet, and filling immediately the impression of every step with water. It may be penetrated to a great distrance by thrusting down a stick, and whenever a fire is kindled upon it, after the layer of leaves and rubbish is burned through, the coals sink down, and are extinguished. The eastern skirts of the Dismal Swamp are overgrown with reeds, ten or twelve feet high, interlaced every where with thorny bamboo briars, which render it almost impossible to pass. Among these are found, here and there, a cypress, and white cedar, which last is commonly mistaken for the jumper. Towards the south, there is a very large tract covered with reeds, without any trees, which being constantly green and waving in the wind, is called the green sea. An ever-green shrub, called the gall-bush, grows plentifully throughout, but especially on the borders, it bears a berry which dies a black color, like the gall of an oak,—and hence its name. Near the middle of the Swamp, the trees grow much closer, both the cypress and cedar; and being always green and loaded with large tops, are much exposed to the wind, and easily blown down, in this boggy place, where the soil is too soft to afford sufficient he'd to the roots. From these causes, the passage is nearly always obstructed by trees, which lay piled in in heaps, and riding upon each other; and the snags left in them pointing in every direction, render it very difficult to clamber over them. On the western border of the Dismal Swamp, is a pine swamp, above a mile in breadth, the greater part of which is covered to the depth of the knee with water: the bottom, however, is firm, and though the pines growing upon it are very large and tall, yet they are not easily blown down by the wind; so that this swamp may be passed without any hinderance, save that occasioned by the depth of the water. With all of these disadvantages, the Dismal Swamp, though disagreeable to the other senses, is, in many places, pleasant to the eye, on account of the perpetual verdure which makes every season like the spring, and every month like May. (See a more particular description of Dismal Swamp, Norfolk county). Dan river, belongs partly to Virginia, and partly to North Carolina, it drains the greater part of Granville, Person, Caswell, Rockingham and Stokes counties, of the latter state, and of Patrick, Henry, Pittsylvania, and Halifax counties, of the former state. The extreme western sources of Dan river are in Patrick county, Virginia, and in the S. E. spurs of the Blue Ridge. The general course almost due east along the intermediate borders of North Carolina and Virginia, to where the four counties of Pittsylvania, Halifax, Person and Caswell meet. Here entering and flowing in Virginia N. E. by E., falls into the Roanoke at Clarksville, having a mean breadth of about 33 miles. This river drains 3,960 square miles. Dividing creek, a small stream of Virginia, forming for a few miles the boundary between Lancaster and Northumberland counties, and then falling into the Chesapeake. Elizabeth river, rises by numerous small branches in Princess Ann and Norfolk counties, flows to the N. W. opening into a wide estuary, terminating in the mouth of James river. The entire length of Elizabeth river is only about 25 miles, but it gains importance as forming the fine harbor of Norfolk, admitting to that port vessels of 18 feet draught, and again as constituting with the Dismal Swamp canal and Pasquotank river, a chain of inland navigation from Chesapeake bay to Albemarle sound. Elk river, in western Virginia, rises amid the Appalachian ridges in Randolph and Pocahontas counties, interlocking sources with those of Monongahela, Little Kanawha, Wheat, Greenbrier and Gauley rivers. Leaving Randolph and Pocahontas, and traversing Nicholas and Kanawha counties, it finally is lost in Great Kanawha at Charleston, after a comparative western course of 100 miles. Gauley river, rises in Randolph, Pocahontas, and Greenbrier counties, by numerous creeks which unite in Nicholas, and flow by a course a little south of west, falling into the right side of the Great Kanawha river, at the head of the Great Falls. The valley of Gauley river is about 60 miles long, and lies between those of Elk and Greenbrier rivers. Greenbrier river rises in the northern part of Pocahontas county, over which it flows, and entering and traversing Greenbrier county, falls into Great Kanawha, after a comparative southwestern course of 90 miles. Greenbrier has its remote sources in the same ridges with those of Cheat river branch of Monongahela, and those of the South branch of the Potomac. The valley of Greenbrier lies between those of James and Gauley rivers. It is an elevated region. The water level is from actual admeasurement, 1,333 feet at the efflux of Greenbrier into Great Kanawha. The mean height of the farms above the ocean level cannot fall much, if any, short of 1,500 feet. Guyandotte river rises in Logan county, from the northwestern foot of the Great Flat Top mountain, and flowing thence N. N. W. draining a valley between those of Great Kanawha and Sandy rivers, enters Cabell county and falls into Ohio river below Barboursville, after a comparative course of about 100 miles. Guyandotte, Little, falls into Ohio river between the mouths of Guyandotte and Great Kanawha rivers, and for some miles above its mouth constitutes the boundary between Mason and Cabell counties. Hampton Roads, local name of the mouth of James river opposite the mouths of Nansemond and Elizabeth rivers. Towards the Chesapeake bay, Hampton Roads is defined on the north by Old Point Comfort, and on the south by Point Willoughby, within James river the termination is indefinite. This sheet of water is sufficiently deep for the largest ships of war. The United States commissioners, appointed to examine the lower part of Chesapeake bay in 1818, reported, that although extensive, Hampton Roads admitted the erection of adequate defences against an enemy's fleet. Holston river rises in the Alleghany mountains, in Virginia, and flows S. S. W. into Tennessee, it then takes a course more to the south to Knoxville, and 35 miles below that town, it unites with the Clinch, and the united streams take the name of the Tennessee. It is navigable for boats of 25 tons burthen, more than 100 miles. On its banks are several iron-works; and the adjacent country abounds with iron-ore, and contains several leadmines. Valuable salt works exist near its sources. Jackson river, the principal constituent of James river, rises by two branches, the north and south forks, in the southern part of Pendleton county, Virginia. Flowing thence southwestward and nearly parallel, and between lateral chains of mountains, the two branches traverse Bath county, and entering Alleghany, incline towards each other and unite, but the united stream still pursues a southwestern course, receiving Dunlop's creek from the west and Pott's creek from the south, after a comparative course from the source in Pendleton of about 50 miles. With the junction of Pott's creek, the whole stream inflects very abruptly to N. E. and flowing in that direction 15 miles, through rugged mountain passes, unites with Cow Pasture river to form James river. The valley of Jackson's river, is an elevated region. At Covington, the county seat of Alleghany county, where Dunlop's creek falls into Jackson's river, the water surface is 1,238 feet above the Atlantic level; it is therefore probable, that the greatest part of the arable surface of the adjacent country exceeds a comparative height of 1,500 feet. Lat 38°, and long 3° west, Washington, interest in the western part of Bath county, about 6 miles north of the junction of the two main branches of Jackson's river. James river. The two streams which unite to form this fine river, may be seen under the he head of Jackson and Cow Pasture rivers. Below the junction of its two constituents, the united water is first known as James river, which forcing a passage through between Pott's and Mill mountains, enters Botetourt, and assumes a southern course 10 miles, to where it receives Craig's creek from the south, and inflecting to S. S. E. flows in that direction 15 miles, thence abruptly turns to N. E. by E. 20 miles, to the western foot of Blue Ridge, and the reception of North river from Augusta and Rockbridge counties. Assuming a S. E. course of 28 miles, James river, now a fine navigable stream, traverses a gap of Blue Ridge about 15 miles N. E. the Peaks of Otter, and in a distance of 30 miles, separating Amherst from Bedford and Campbell counties, and traversing another lateral chain of mountains near Lynchburg, again turns to N. E. Continuing the latter course 40 miles and separating Amherst and Nelson from Campbell and Buckingham counties, James river assumes a course a little south of east 70 miles by comparative course, having on the left the counties of Albemarle, Fluvanna, Goochland and Henrico, and on the right the counties of Buckingham, Cumberland, Powhatan, and Chesterfield, to the head of tide water and the lower falls at Richmond. Meeting the tide, James river, similar to most of the Atlantic rivers of the United States generally, widens and presenting rather the features of a bay than those of a river, turns to a little E. of S. E. 90 miles by comparative courses, finally merges into Chesapeake bay, between Point Willoughby and Old Point Comfort. The entire length of James river, from its source in Pendleton, to its efflux into Chesapeake, is 368 miles, but following the actual meanders it is probable that this stream flows not much if any less than 500 miles. The valley of James river, including all its tributaries, lies between lat 35° 40′ and 38° 20′, and in long. extends near 1° east to 3° 40′ west from Washington. A line in a S. S. W. direction from Old Point Comfort to the Alleghany mountain will pass along very near the middle of this valley 225 miles. The broadest part is along the extreme sources, from the fountains of Jackson's river to those of Craig's creek 90 miles, but the mean width amounts to about 45 miles and the area to 10,125 square miles. In the natural state James river affords at, and a few miles above, its mouth, depth of water for ships of any required draught, but the depth gradually shallows, so that only vessels of 130 tons can reach Rockets, or the port of Richmond. Though much has been designed above tide water in meliorating the navigation, little has been actually accomplished. A canal connects the tide below, and the navigable water above the falls at Richmond. The following relative heights will show the gradual rise of the James river. Columbia at the mouth of Rivanna 178 feet; Scottsville, at the southeastern angle of Albemarle county, and below the southeast chain of the Appalachian system 255 feet; Lynchburg, also below the southeast mountain 500 feet; Pattonsburg, at the great bend above Blue Ridge 806 feet; Covington, at the junction of Dunlop's creek and Jackson's river, 1,222 feet; highest spring tributary to Craig's creek, 2,498 feet. Those heights are only the elevation of the water, and at every point must fall short of that of the arable soil. Without any great risk of error, an allowance of winter temperature equal to 6 degrees of Fahrenheit may be made between the extremes of this valley on the same latitude. Kanawha, Great, river. North Carolina and Virginia, has the most remote source in Ashe county of the former, between the Blue Ridge and main Appalachian chain, there known by the name of Iron mountain; the two higher branches, after draining the northern part of Ashe, unite near the boundary between North Carolina and Virginia, and continuing their original course to the N. E. by N., enters Grayson county of the latter state, breaks through the Iron mountain between Grayson and Wythe; winds over the latter and Montgomery; thence inflecting to the N. N. W. traverses Walker's and Peter's mountains. Below the latter chain, the course of N. N. W. is continued to the mouth of Gauley river having received also from the northeast Greenbrier. Above Gauley river, the main volume of Kanawha is called New river; but receiving the Gauley, and turning to N. W., this now large stream, known as the Great Kanawha, is still farther augmented from the north by Elk river, and from the south by Coal river, falls into Ohio river at Point Pleasant, after a comparative course of 280 miles, 100 above Walker's mountain, 100 from the pass through Walker's mountain to the mouth of Gauley river, and 80 from the mouth of Gauley to the Ohio. The higher branches of New river have interlocking sources with those of Catawba and Yadkin on the S. E., and with those of Watauga and Holston to the northwest. Below the Iron mountains the interlocking souces are with those of Clinch and Sandy to the west, those of Roanoke to the east, and those of James river N. E., as far down as the gorge of Peter's mountain, westward of the latter pass. Greenbrier, coming in from the north has its sources in the same region with those of the Potomac on the northeast, and with those of the Monongahela to the northward. The valley of Kanawha proper, below Gauley river, lies generally between the valley of Guyandotte on the S. W., and that of Little Kanawha N. E., though the sources of Elk river, also reach the vicinity of those of Monongahela. The entire valley of Great Kanawha, including that of New river, extends lat 36° 15′ in Ashe county, North Carolina, to 38° 52′ at the junction of Kanawha and Ohio, and in long 2° 43′ at the higher source of Greenbrier, to 5° 08′ west of Washington city. The length of this valley from the Blue Ridge between Patrick and Montgomery counties, Virginia, in a N. W. direction is 180 miles, the utmost breadth from the sources of New river, to those of Greenbrier is 180, but the mean width is about 60, and the area may be stated at 10,800 square miles. The most remarkable feature in the valley of the Great Kanawha, as a physical section, is relative height. At the mouth of Sinking creek, between Walker's and Peter's mountains, 120 miles by comparative courses below the sources, the water level is 1,585 feet above the Atlantic tides; at the mouth of Greenbrier 1,333, and at the mouth into Ohio 525 feet. Comparing the fall from Sinking creek to the mouth of Greenbrier 252 feet in 30 miles direct, that above Sinking creek must be 900 feet at least, consequently, the higher branches of New river, in Ashe county, must rise at a comparative height of upwards of 2,500 feet. Little Kanawha, rises in Lewis county, and flowing N. W. by W., enters Wood, and falls into the Ohio, at Parkersburg, after a comparative course of 90 miles. The valley of this river is nearly commensurate with Wood and Lewis counties, and has that of Great Kanawha south, Middle Island creek to the north, and that of Monongahela, N. E. is 150 yards wide at the mouth. It yields a navigation of ten miles only; perhaps its northern branch called Junius' creek, which interlocks with the west fork of Monongahela, may one day admit a shorter passage from the latter into the Ohio. Little river, of Montgomery county, rises in the western vallies of the Blue Ridge, and flowing to the N. W., about 25 miles comparative course, falls into New river, 12 miles S. W. by W. Christiansburg. Mattapony river has its extreme source on the eastern border of Orange county, near the Rapid Ann, about 25 miles westward Fredericksburg, but the most numerous of its creeks are in Spottsylvania. These unite within, and traverse Caroline, and thence forming a boundary between King William and King and Queen, unite with the Pamunky, to form York river, after a comparative southeastern course of ten miles. The valley of the Mattapony lies between those of the Rappahannock and Pamunky, and is traversed by N. lat 38° and the meridian of Washington. Matchapungo Inlet, on the coast of the Atlantic, between Hog and Prout Islands, Northampton county. It opens into a sheet or small gulf, called Broad Water, 28 miles N. N. E. cape Charles, lat 37° 20′. Meherin river, of Virginia and North Carolina, deriving its most remote sources from Charlotte, but rising principally in Lunenburg and Mecklenburg counties, and uniting on the western margin of Brunswick. Continuing its original course S. E. by E. over Brunswick and Greenville, and thence seperating a part of Greenville from Southampton, it enters North Carolina, between Northampton and Gates counties, and joins the Nottaway to form the Chowan, between Gates and Hertford counties. The entire comparative course of the Meherin is about 95 miles, but the valley is narrow, not exceeding 20 miles width at any part, (mean width hardly 10,) area about 900 square miles, lying between the vallies of Roanoke and Nottaway. Monongahela river, in Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania, is formed by Monongahela proper, Tygart's Valley river, Cheat river, and the Youghioghany. The Cheat is in fact the main stream, having its remote source in the southern part of Randolph county, Virginia, at lat 38° 27′, interlocking sources with those of Green river, and Jackson's branch of James river. The remote sources of Tygait's Valley river, are nearly as far south as those of Cheat, and also in Randolph county. The mountain ridge from which both streams rise is known locally as Greenbrier mountain, and the valleys from which the higher sources are derived, must be at least 2,500 feet elevated above tide water in Chesapeake bay. Monongahela proper, is the western branch, rising in Lewis county, Virginia, with interlocking sources with those of Tygart's Valley and little Kanawha. The three branches near their sources, pursue a general northern course, but the two western, gradually approach each other, and unite at lat 39° 28′, where they form a point of seperation between Harrison and Monongalia counties. Thence assuming a northern course over the latter county, finally leave Virginia, and form a junction with Cheat on the boundary between Fayette and Green counties, Pennsylvania. The Cheat in the highest part of its course, flows along a mountain valley, in a northern direction, but gradually inclining to northwestward, as already noticed under the head of Cheat river. Below the junction of the main branches, the Monongahela, by a rather circuitous channel, pursues a general northern course over Pennsylvania, about 50 miles, comparative length to its junction with Youghioghany, 11 miles S. E. of Pittsburg. The Youghioghany is a considerable branch, having its remote sources in the western part of Alleghany county, Maryland Flowing thence northwardly, enters Pennsylvania, and separating for some few miles, Somerset, from Fayette county, receives a large tributary from the eastward; Casselman's river, and turning to N. N. W. about 50 miles, comparative course, is lost in the Monongahela at MacKeesport. Augmented by the Youghioghany, the Monongahela below the junction, assumes the course of the former, 18 miles by the channel, but only 11 direct distance to Pittsburg, where it unites with the Alleghany to form the Ohio. The general course of the Monongahela is almost exactly north, and almost as exactly along long 3° W. Washington, 150 miles by comparative distance. The widest part of its valley lies nearly along the line between Pennsylvania and Virginia, 80 miles, the mean width 40, and area 6,000 square miles. If we allow only 1,500 feet elevation to the arable country on the head branches of Cheat, Pittsburg being elevated 678 feet, will give a descent of 822 feet to the valley of Monongahela. The extremes of lat are thus almost exactly compensated by declivity, and explain why the seasons near Pittsburg and in Randolph county, Virginia, differ but slightly. Though the two eastern branches, Cheat and Youghioghany, rise in mountain vallies, and the whole country dramed by all the tributaries of Monongahela is very broken and rocky, direct falls are rare and of no great elevation when they occur. Cheat river, is navigable through Monongalia and Preston, into Randolph county; both branches of Monongahela proper, above their junction, and Youghioghany to Ohio, have falls. The whole valley has gained recent increase of importance as being part of the route or routes of proposed lines of canal improvement. Monongahela river is 400 yards wide at its mouth; at the mouth of the Youghioghaney 12 or 15 miles higher up, it is 300 yards wide; and continues of that width to the mouth of Cheat river, a distance of 90 miles by water, but only 58 by land. In this space the navigation is frequently interrupted by rapids, but are passable by boats when the river rises a few feet. From that point it admits light boats, except in dry seasons 65 miles further, to the head of Tygart's valley,—presenting only some falls of a few feet, and lessening in width to 20 yards. The western fork is navigable in winter 10 or 15 miles, towards the northern branch of the Little Kanawha, to which a good wagon road might be made. The Youghioghany is the principal branch of this river. This branch passes through the Laurel mountain about 300 miles from its mouth, and is that far, from 300 to 150 yards wide, and the navigation much obstructed in dry weather by rapids and shoals. In its passage through the mountain the fall is very great, admitting no navigation for ten miles to the Turkey Foot. Thence to the great crossing, about 20 miles, it is again navigable, except in dry seasons, and is at that place 20 yards wide. The sources of this river are divided from those of the Potomac by the Alleghany mountain. From the falls at which it intercepts the Laurel mountain to Fort Cumberland, the head of navigation on the Potomac, is 40 miles of very mountaneous road. Willis' creek, at the mouth of which was Fort Cumberland, is 30 or 40 yards wide, but beyond that, there is no navigation. Nansemond river rises in Isle of Wight and Nansemond counties, but chiefly in the latter. It opens by a comparatively wide bay into Hampton Roads, and is navigable for vessels of 250 tons to Sleepy Hole, for those of 100, to Suffolk, the county town of Nansemond, and for those of 25 tons to Milner's. Nottoway river, of Virginia and North Carolina, has its most remote source in Prince Edward county. Flowing thence S. S. E. between Nottaway and Lunenburg counties, between Dinwiddie and Brunswick, turns to eastward between Greensville and the western part of Sussex. Entering the latter, and first curving northward winds to S. E., and traversing Sussex and Southampton counties, receives Blackwater river from the north, and entering Gates county, North Carolina, bends to S. W. 10 miles to its junction with Meherin, to form Chowan river. The entire length of Nottaway by comparative courses is 110 miles. The Nottoway valley is about 100 miles, by 20 mean width, comprising great part of Nottaway, Dinwiddie, Sussex, Surry, and Southampton counties, and a smaller part of Lunenburg, Brunswick, Greensville, Prince George, Isle of Wight, and Nansemond counties, and a minor part of Gates county, North Carolina. Occoquan river rises in Loudon, Fairfax, and Fauquier counties, traverses and drains the western part of Prince William county, and thence forming the boundary between Prince William and Fairfax counties, falls into the Potomac, about 25 miles below Washington City, and nearly opposite Indian Point. [See Prince William county.] Ohio forms the boundary of Virginia for 355 miles. It is in some respects the most remarkable river upon earth. The physical section of the earth drained by it lies between lat 34° 12′ and 42° 27′, and long 1° and 12° west of Washington City. The course of the Ohio proper, from the sources of Alleghany to its junction with the Mississippi, is by calculation 59° 30′ west, 680 statute miles. The form of the valley of the Ohio approaches, in a very remarkable manner, that of a regular ellipse, of which a line drawn from its most northern to its most southern sources, from Orleans creek, Cataraugus county, New York, to Bear Grass creek, Marion county, Alabama, 750 statute miles,—would be the transverse diameter, and another line extending from the Blue Ridge, where the sources of the Great Kanawha and those of Watauga branch of Tennessee rise, to the northwestern sources of the Wabash, 450 miles, would be the congugate axis. Measured by the rhombs following the elements in the following table, the area comes out more than 200,000 square miles. Table of the extent in square miles of the valley of Ohio river: square miles. Between lat. 34° and 35° 2¼ Rhombs, 8,986 Between lat. 35 36 6½ Rhombs, 25,655 Between lat. 36 37 7½ Rhombs, 29,205 Between lat. 37 38 8½ Rhombs, 32,700 Between lat. 38 39 8½ Rhombs, 32,250 Between lat. 39 40 8¾ Rhombs, 32,742 Between lat. 40 41 8 Rhombs, 29,488 Between lat. 41 42 2½ Rhombs, 9,085 Aggregate extent in square miles, 200,111 Allowing the greatest length to be 750 miles, the mean width will be 267 very nearly, or the mean breadth amounts to within a trifling fraction of one-third of the greatest length, a compactness seldom equalled in rivers. If the Alleghany is regarded as the primary and remote constituent of Ohio, this great stream rises by numerous creeks in McKean and Potter counties, Pennsylvania, and Alleghany and Cataraugus counties, New York. Becoming navigable near the line of demarcation between the two states, the stream, with partial windings, pursues the general course already stated, to its junction with the Mississippi, affording a natural navigable channel of between 1,200 and 1,300 miles. The opposing inclined plains of Ohio valley are of unequal extent, nearly in the proportion of two to three, the larger falling from the Appalachian system of mountains, and containing 120,000 square miles. In their features also the two Ohio plains differ essentially. The southeastern, declining from a mountainous outline, has a comparatively rapid slope. The most elevated table land from which the eastern tributaries flow, is that where rise the sources of Clinch, Holston, and Great Kanawha, about 2,500 feet. The Appalachian table land declines in relative elevation both to north and south of this nucleus, but there is no one part from the sources of Alleghany and Genesee to those of Tennessee and Coosa, through 7° of lat but which exceeds 1,000 feet. The elevation of Ohio at Pittsburg, where the Alleghany and Monongahela unite, is 678 feet, and that of the low water at the confluence of Ohio and Mississippi 283 feet; of course the Ohio below Pittsburg, has a fall of 395 feet in 948 miles, the length of the intermediate channel. The left tributaries must have, from the preceding data, a descent of from 1,000 to 2,200 feet. Down this rapid declivity, advancing from north to south, are found the streams of Clarion, Kiskiminitas, Monongahela, Great Kanawha, Sandy, Kentucky, Cumberland and Tennessee, and several of lesser length of course, whose sources do not reach the Appalachian vallies. It may well excite surprise, that along this steep plain, direct falls are not frequent, and where they do occur are of moderate direct pitch. 7 To an eye sufficiently elevated, and powers of vision sufficiently enlarged, the whole valley of Ohio would appear one immense declivity, falling very nearly at right angles to the general range of the Appalachian system, and the rivers would appear to have cut deep channels seldom in a direction corresponding to the plane of general descent. Of these channels that of Ohio would appear as the principal. Persons competent have carefully measured the height of the hills, in the vicinity of Pittsburg, and found them about 460 feet above the low water level of the rivers, or 1,138 feet above the level of the Atlantic tides. Above Pittsburg to the hills, which rise like mountains from lake Erie, the ascent is at least 400 feet, and below Pittsburg the fall to the Mississippi has been shown to be 395 feet. Without therefore estimating mountain ridges, the great inclined plain of Ohio has a descent of upwards of a foot to the statute mile, but what is something remarkable, the rivers, and particularly the Ohio itself, do not fall gradually with the planes of their courses. The actual channel from Pittsburg to the mouth is 948 statute miles, and the fall 4,716 inches, or not quite five inches per mile. The waters in effect have abraded their channels, deeper toward their sources than in proportion to length of course. It is this circumstance which has contributed to give to the Ohio proper, the appearance of flowing in a deep and immense ravine. The difference of climate arising from difference of level, frequently exceeding a degree of latitude in less than a mile, and radiated heat, with an exuberant alluvial soil, giving in spring a precocious vegetation along the river bank, have superinduced great misunderstanding respecting the temperature and seasons of this region. Descending the Ohio, say from Pittsburg, the scenery along the banks and hills, is in an eminent degree picturesque and varied, but these fine features imperceptibly fade away, and long before reaching the Mississippi, totally disappear, and leave a narrow horizontal ring sweeping round the heavens, formed by the trees along the banks. As a navigable channel, few, if any other rivers of the globe, equal the Ohio. In the higher part of its course, the navigation is annually more or less impeded in winter by ice, and in autumn by a want of water. Impediment from ice prevails in all its course, but below the influx of Kanawha, drought is of less injury, and below the rapids at Louisville, in a commercial point of view, removed by a navigable canal. The four most important of all mineral productions abound in the Ohio valley, limestone, mineral coal, salt, and iron ore. Of all continuous bodies of productive soil on earth, if climate and fertility are combined, the valley of Ohio will, it is probable, sustain the most dense population. Not long since there did not exist upon its immense surface 20,000 civilized human beings. In 1831, it sustained about 3,000,000. Can the history of the world afford any parallel to such increase? Pamunkey river, the principal constituent of York river, is formed by Pamunky proper and North Anna. The latter rises in Orange, the northern part of Louisa and in Spottsylvania counties, and flowing thence southeastward unites with the Pamunkey, between Caroline and Hanover counties. The Pamunky rises in the S. W. mountain, on the border between Albemarle and Louisa, drains the southern and central part of Louisa, and traversing Hanover, joins the North Anna. Below their junction, the united waters, known by the name of Pamunky, preserve the original course southeastward, about 45 miles comparative course, (but perhaps double that distance by the bends,) to its junction with Mattapony to form York river. The entire comparative length of Pamunkey, by either branch, is about 90 miles. The broadest part of the valley but little exceeds 30 miles, and is only about 15 mean width, area 1,300 square miles, lying between those of James and Chickahominy on the right, and Mattopony on the left. Pig river, rises in the southeastern slope of the Blue Ridge, and flowing thence eastward, between Black water and Irvine rivers, traverses and drains the central part of Franklin county, and entering Pittsylvania, turns to E. and falls into Roanoke, after a comparative course of 35 miles. Pocatalico.—This river has its sources near the northern boundary of the county of Kanawha, and flows through a body of forest land finely timbered: much of it fertile, and sufficiently level for advantageous cultivation. The alluvial lands on its borders, are generally rich, and of width sufficient to form good farms. Pocatilico discharges itself into the Great Kanawha, 20 miles below Charleston, and forty miles above the mouth of the latter river; it is navigable by batteaux, which ascend from 20 to 30 miles, and during the winter and spring months, large and heavy loaded boats may descend with safety, as also rafts of timber of various descriptions. Extensive beds of rich bituminous coal, are found near the Pocatalico, and its branches, and iron ores apparently of good quality, are often dug out of the hills. Potomac river, of Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania. This river above Blue Ridge, is formed by the north branch, distinctively called Potomac, Patterson's river, South Branch, Cacapon, Back creek, Opequhan and Sheandoah, from the southwestward, and by a series of bold, though comparatively small streams from the northward. The stream to which the name of Potomoc is first applied, rises in the Alleghany chain, opposite to the sources of Cheat and Youghioghany branches of Monongahela, at lat. 39° 10′ long. from Washington city, 2° 30′ W. Flowing thence N. E. 30 miles, receives from the north, Savage river, and bending to S. E. 10 miles, traverses one or two minor chains of mountains, and returning to N. E. 18 miles to the influx of Will's creek, from the north at Cumberland. Now a considerable stream, by a very tortuous channel, but direct distance 15 miles to S. E., the Potomac below Cumberland, breaks through several chains of mountains to the influx of South Branch. The latter is in length of course, and area drained, the main branch. The various sources of this mountain river originate in Pendleton county, Virginia, lat. 38° 25′, between the Alleghany and Kittatinny chains. Assuming a general course of N. E., the branches unite in Hardy county, near Moorfields, below which, in a distance comparative course of 40 miles to its union with the N. Branch, the South Branch receives no considerable tributary. The volume formed by both branches, breaks through a mountain chain immediately below their junction, and bending to N. E. by comparative distance of 25 miles, but by a very winding channel reaches its extreme northern point at Hancock's town, lat. 39° 41′, and within less than two miles south of the southern boundary of Pennsylvania. Passing Hancock's town the Potomac again inflects to S. E., and as above winds by a very crooked channel, but by comparative course of 35 miles to the influx of Shenandoah from the southward. Shenandoah is the longest branch of Potomac, having a comparative length of 130 miles, and brings down a volume of water but little inferior to that of the main stream. It has its most remote sources in Augusta county, Virginia, interlocks sources with those of Great Calf Pasture branch of James river, and by Blue Ridge, is separated from those of Rivanna, as far south as lat. 37° 55′, almost exactly due west of the eutrance of Potomac into Chesapeake bay. The elongated valley of Shenandoah is part of the great mountain valley of Kittatinny, and comprises nearly all the counties of Augusta, Rockingham, Page and Shenandoah, with the eastern sections of Frederick and Jefferson. The upper valley of Potomac, including that of Shenandoah is in length from S. W. to N. E. 160 miles, where broadest 75 miles, but has a mean breadth of 50 miles, area 8,000 square miles. The water level of Potomac at Harper's Ferry is 288 feet above tide water; therefore we may assume at 350 feet the lowest arable land in the valley above the Blue Ridge. This is equivalent to a degree of latitude on the aerial temperature at the lowest point of depression. So rapid is the rise, however, in crossing the valley to the foot of Alleghany mountain, that an allowance of 1,200 feet is rather too moderate an estimate for the extremes of cultivated soil. Passing the Blue Ridge, with partial windings, the Potomac continues S. E. by comparative courses 50 miles to the lower falls and head of ocean tides at Georgetown. Having in the intermediate distance received the Monocacy river, from the north, and some minor creeks from the south; like the Delaware, below Trenton, and the higher part of Chesapeake bay, below the mouth of Susquehannah the Potomac, meeting the tide, bends along the outer margin of the primitive rock. It is indeed very remarkable that the three bends, in the three consecutive rivers, follow almost exactly the same geographical line: or flow from head of tide water, S. W.— the Delaware 60, Chesapeake 40, and Potomac 45 miles,—the latter a few miles below the place at which it retires from the primitive rocks, reaches within six miles of the Rappahannock, below Fradericksburg. The two latter rivers not far from parallel to each other, assume a comparative course 75 miles to the N. E., the intermediate peninsula being no where above 22 miles wide, and the distance from the south side of the mouth of the Potomac, to the north side of that of the Rappahannock, is only 20 miles. Combining the two sections above and below the Blue Ridge, the whole basin of the Potomac embraces an area of 12,950 square miles, extending from lat. 37° 50′ to 40°, and in long. 0° 45′ E. to 2° 45′ W. of Washington city. The winding of its tide water channel renders the navigation of the Potomac bay (for such it is below George Town,) tedious though not dangerous. The channel has sufficient depth to admit ships of the line of 74 guns to the navy yard at Washington. With its defects and advantages as an agricultural and commercial section,—the basin of the Potomac is a very interesting object in physical and political geography;—deriving its sources from the main Appalachian spine, the Potomac has worn its channel through the intervening chains to their bases; and performed an immense disproportion of the necessary task to effect a water rout into the valley of the Ohio,—such a rout has been commenced under the name of Chesapeake and Ohio canal, and is yet in progress. The Potomac is eight miles wide at its mouth, four and a half at Nomony bay, three at Acquia, one and a half at Hollooing point, and one and a half at Alexandria. Its soundings are seven fathoms at its mouth, five at St. Georges island, four and a half at Lower Matchodie, three at Swan's point and up to Alexandria, thence 20 feet of water to the falls, which are 13 miles above Alexandria. These falls are 15 miles in length, and of very great descent, and the navigation above them for batteaux and canoes is so much interrupted as to be little used, It is however used in a small degree up the Cohongoronta branch as far as Cumberland, at the mouth of Wills's creek; and is capable of being made navigable at no grerat expence. The Shenandoah branch interlocks with the sources of James river, near the Blue Ridge. Rappahannock river, formed by two branches, Hedgeman's and Thornton's rivers, both deriving their remote sources from Blue Ridge. Hedgeman's river, after a comparative course of 30 miles, between Fauquier and Culpeper counties, receives Thornton's river from the latter, and the united waters continuing the course of the former S. E. 20 miles, join the Rapid Ann. A navigable river at the junction of its two main branches, the Rappahannock, continues to the S. E. 10 miles to its lowest falls, where it traverses the primitive ledge, and meets the ocean tides at Fredericksburg. Similar to the Delaware, and all the large western tributaries of Chesapeake bay, the Rappahannock turns after passing the primitive rock, but after a short curve to the southward, this stream resumes a S. E. course, which with a rather tortuous channel it maintains to Leeds, in Westmoreland county, where it approaches to within five miles of Potomac, at the mouth of Mattox creek. Gradually widening, and with the features of a long, narrow bay of 55 miles, the Rappahannock by a S. S. E. course, is lost in Chesapeake bay between Windmill and Stingray points. The tide ascends this channel to the falls at Fredericksburg, something above 100 miles, admiting vessels of considerable tonnage. In all the distance below the union of its two main branches, it does not receive any accession above the size of a small creek. The entire basin is 140 miles by a mean width of 20; area 2,800 square miles. Extending in lat. from 37° 34′ to 38° 44′, and in long from 0° 41′ east to 1° 22′ west of Washington. Rapid Ann river, deriving its remote sources from the Blue Ridge, and flowing thence S. E. 20 miles across the valley, between Blue Ridge and South East mountain, turns thence N. E. 15 miles to the influx of Robertson's river from the N. W. Passing South East mountain and inflecting to a general eastern course of 30 miles, it joins the Rappahannock 10 miles above Fredericksburg, after a comparative course of 65 miles. In nearly the whole of its length Rapid Ann separates Orange county first 35 miles from Madison, and thence 25 from Culpeper. At their junction it is superior in volume to Rappahannock; and exceeding also in length, of course, the Rapid Ann is the main stream. Rivanna river, a branch of James river, is navigable to its intersection with the South West mountain, which is about 22 miles. The navigation has lately been opened by dams and canals, and it is now navigable to Pireus, within one mile and a quarter of Charlottesville. Rock creek, a small stream of Maryland, and of the District of Columbia, gains importance only as it separates the city of Washington from Georgetown. This creek has its extreme source about four miles westward of Mechanicsville, Montgomery county, Maryland, heading with the east branch of Potomac river, at an elevation above tide water at Georgetown of 500 feet. The entire length of the creek, following its valley, is about 28 miles. The fall being upwards of 17 feet to the mile, and that fall being in many places far above the mean, renders it an excellent mill-stream. Roanoke river, of Virginia and North Carolina. Taken in the utmost extent, Roanoke basin is the same as Albemarle, and includes the sub-basins or vallies of Roanoke proper, and Chowan river. Advancing from south to north, all the rivers beyond the Roanoke, have their most remote fountains on the Atlantic side of Blue Ridge; but with the Roanoke a new feature appears. The Blue Ridge is pierced by that stream, which derives its higher fountains from the main Alleghany chain in Montgomery county, Virginia, and within eight miles of the main channel of New river, and at an elevation without estimating the mountain ridges, of at least 2,000 feet Issuing by numerous creeks from this elevated tract, and uniting into one stream near the border between Montgomery and Botetourt counties, it is here literally "The Rapid Roanoke," having at Salem, in the latter county, fallen 1,000 feet in little more than 20 miles. At Salem the water level is 1,002 feet by actual admeasurement, above mean Atlantic tide. Below Salem the river inflects 20 miles in an eastern course, to its passage through Blue Ridge, and thence S. E. 25 miles to its passage through South East mountain. Passing South East mountain between Bedford and Pittsylvania counties, the now navigable volume sweeps by an elliptic curve to northward, and round to S. E. 50 miles comparative course, to the influx of Dan river, entering its right side from the west part. Below the junction of these two rivers, the united waters in a course a little south of east 60 miles by comparative distance, reach tide water at Weldon, having fallen by a lengthened cataract over the primitive ledge. About midway between the influx of Dan river and Weldon, Roanoke leaves Virginia and enters North Carolina. Mingling with the tide, the Roanoke by a very tortuous channel, but by comparative course flows South East 50 miles, and thence eastward 25 miles to its junction with Chowan river at the head of Albemarle sound. The entire valley of Roanoke, if measured along the main stream or Dan river is 250 miles, but the rivers wind over this space by channels of much greater length. By comparative courses it is 155 miles from Salem to Weldon, whilst from a report made by the Roanoke company, the intermediate channel is 244 miles. Taking these proportions, the length of this river by its meanders is about 400 miles. Including the whole Albemarle basin, it is 290 miles from its outlet into the Atlantic ocean, to the fountains of Roanoke in Alleghany mountain, but with the Chowan and Dan vallies united to that of the principal river, the basin is comparatively narrow, being only 80 miles where broadest, and not having a mean breadth above 50 miles, or an area exceeding 14,500 square miles. It is not, however, its extent which gives most interest to the Roanoke or Albemarle basin; it is at once a fine physical section and physical limit. The difference of arable level, amounts to at least 2,000 feet, and no two regions of the earth can differ in every feature more than do the truly beautiful hills and vales on each side of the Appalachian chains, from the stagnant marshes and level plains towards the Atlantic ocean. Along the lower Roanoke commences, advancing from the north the profitable cultivation of cotton, the fig tree begins to appear, rice can be produced, and in summer the advance towards the tropics is felt, and very distinctly seen on vegetation. Ascending the basin, the aspect of the northern states gradually appears, both on the features of nature and on cultivated vegetables. Wheat, rye, and other small grain, with meadow grasses, and the apple, flourish. The summers are cooler, and the winters have the severity suitable to relative elevation. Though the higher part of Roanoke is annually frozen, and for a shorter or longer period rendered unnavigable in winter, with lower Roanoke commences the region on the Atlantic coast where navigation remains open at all seasons. It is true that even Albemarle sound has been occasionally impeded with ice, but this phenomenon is rare. As a navigable channel following either branch, the importance of this basin is lessened by the shallowness of Albemarle sound—an irremovable impediment. At present, however, there is in progress a scheme for connecting, by rail-road, the navigable tide water below Weldon with Chesapeake bay. In its actual state the rivers are navigable for boats to Salem on the Roanoke, and to Danbury in North Carolina by Dan river. This was effected by side canals, sluices and other artificial improvements. Sandy river, of Virginia and Kentucky, is composed of two branches, called relatively East fork and West fork. East fork, the main constituent of Sandy, rises in the Appalachian valleys, interlocking sources with those of Great Kanawha to the east, and with those of Holston and Clinch branches of Tennessee river to the S. E. Issuing from this elevated region, and draining part of Tazewell and Logan counties, Virginia, the Sandy river pursues a N. W. direction by comparative courses 50 miles, to its passage through Cumberland mountain. Becoming a boundary between Virginia and Kentucky below the Cumberland chain, Sandy assumes a direction of N. N. W. 70 miles, separating Logan and Cabell counties, of Virginia, from Floyd, Lawrence, and Greenup counties, of Kentucky, to its final influx into Ohio river opposite Burlington, Ohio. West Sandy rises in Russell and Tazewell counties, Virginia, and assuming a N. W. direction pierces the Cumberland chain, enters Kentucky, and after traversing Pike and Floyd counties, bends to the northward and joins East Sandy in Lawrence county. The valley of Sandy river has that of Tennessee river S., Kentucky S. W., Licking W., that of Ohio N., Guyandotte E., and Great Kanawha S. E. It is about 100 miles long, mean width 35, and area 3,500 square miles. Shenandoah river, one of the great southern branches of Potomac river, is composed of two branches, called with no great relative correctness, North Branch and South Branch. The southern and main branch rises in Augusta county, as far south as latitude 38°, and long. 2° west of Washington City. Flowing thence northeastward along the northwestern slope of Blue Ridge, over Augusta, Rockingham, and Page counties, receives the North Branch in the southern angle of Federick county, after a comparative course of 90 miles. The North Branch of Shenandoah river has its source in Rockingham county, from which it flows by comparative courses N. N. E. 50 miles over Rockingham and Shenandoah counties, enters Frederick, bends to the eastward, and joins the South Branch as already noticed. Below the junction of its two branches, the Shenandoah flows N. E. along the N. W. slope of Blue Ridge 40 miles to its junction with the Potomac at Harper's Ferry. Tennessee river, of the state of the same name, and of the states of Kentucky, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia, is the great southeastern constituent of the Ohio. The very peculiar features of the valley of Tennessee, demand a general and particular notice. This valley is naturally divided into two physical sections; the higher or mountainous, and the lower or hilly. The most remote sources of Tennessee are found in those of Clinch, in Tazewell, and of Holston in Wythe counties, of Virginia, interlocking sources with those of Sandy and Great Kanawha. From this elevated origin, the main constituents pursue a southwestern course between the two parallel chains of the Appalachian system, Cumberland, and the main spine, both stretching in a similar direction with the rivers, at a mean distance of about 70 miles asunder. Besides this principal valley, another of less width between the main chain and Blue Ridge, is also drained by the constituents of Tennessee; but this more eastern and more elevated valley slopes to the N. W., at right angles to the mountain chains. The latter mountain valley comprises the North Carolina and Georgia part of the valley of Tennessee. Including both minor vallies, upper Tennessee drains an elongated ellipise of 350 miles longer axis; shorter axis 120 miles from the Blue Ridge at the sources of French Broad, to Cumberland mountain, where it separates the sources of Powell's river from those of Cumberland: mean breadth 80 miles, and area 24,000 square miles. Descending from the extreme fountains in Virginia, the valley widens as the mountain chains recede from each other, and again contracts as the same chains gradually re-approach each other at the northwestern angle of Georgia, and northeastern of Alabama. At the latter point, well known by the name of Nickajack, all the large tributaries have united, and the Blue Ridge and Cumberland chains have inclined to within less than 40 miles of each other. Below Nickajack, the now large volume of Tennessee continues S. W. 60 miles, without receiving a single creek of 20 miles course, the two bounding mountain chains still inclining upon each other, till their approaching bases force the river through the Cumberland chain. To one whose eye first glanced on the volume of Tennessee, below its passage through Cumberland mountain, without previous knowledge of the valley above, no adequate idea would occur, that before it, flowed the accumulated waters of a mountainous region of 24,000 square miles extent. In fact, to an observer, thus placed, the main volume of Tennessee would appear as one of the constitutents of a river valley below the Cumberland chain. About 20 miles below the passage of Tennessee river through it, the Cumberland mountain receives the Blue Ridge, if such a term can be correctly applied to the merging of two mountain chains. Here, along the northern sources of Mobile basin, the Appalachian system changes its distinctive character, and the confused masses of hills follow each other westwardly toward the Mississippi. The Tennessee river deflects rather more than does the mountain system, and flows N. W. by W. by comparative courses 120 miles, to the northwestern angle of Alabama, and the northeastern of Mississippi, where this large stream again bends at nearly right angles, and pursues a course of a very little west of north 150 miles, to its entrance into the Ohio, after an entire comparative course of 680 miles. The second great section of Tennessee, and the lower part of the first, below Nickajack, are comprised in the fine northern valley of Alabama. The main volume flowing along the base of a physical line extending from the Ohio valley in the vicinity of Pittsburg, to the northern part of the basin of Mobile. The very striking coincidence of the river inflections between the extremes of this region, must appear to the most inattentive observer of a good map of that part of the United States. This regularity of structure is evinced by the great inflections of Ohio, Kanawha, Kentucky, Green, Cumberland, and Tennessee rivers. The Tennessee itself literally occupies the base of the physical region indicated, as in all its comparative course below Nickajack, or its entrance into Alabama, of 330 miles, it does not receive a single stream above the size of a large creek, nor does the outer selvedge of its valley on the left, in Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Kentucky, exceed a mean breadth of 20 miles. On the right, embosomed between Tennessee and Cumberland rivers, and comprising central Tennessee, and northern Alabama, spreads a physical region, extending from Cumberland mountain to the lower reach of Tennessee river, 130 miles, with a mean breadth of 80 miles, and an area of 10,400 square miles. This beautiful tract is semi-circled by the main volume of Tennessee, and drained by Elk river, Duck river, and innumerable creeks. Below Duck river, however, Tennessee receives no stream from either side of any magnitude worthy notice in a general view. Including all its sections, the lower valley of Tennessee comprises an area of 17,600 square miles; and the whole valley embraces a superficies of 41,600 square miles. This extent of Tennessee valley, if compared with the whole valley of Ohio, spreads over nearly one-fifth part, and gives to Tennessee the first rank among the tributaries of Ohio. Amongst the peculiar features of the course of Tennessee, the most remarkable is, that rising as far north as lat. 37° 10′, and curving thence southward to lat. 34° 23′, it again recurves back to its original latitude, and falls into the Ohio river almost exactly due west from its primitive springs in Tazewell county; thus embosoming nearly the whole large valley of Cumberland, and part of that of Green river. Geographically, Tennessee valley lies between north lat. 34° 10′ and 37° 10′, and in long. between 4° 15′ and 11° 40′ west of Washington. It is the first and largest, advancing from the south, of those streams gushing from the elevated slopes of the Appalachian ridges, and which flow westward into the great basin of the Mississippi. In relative height, there is above 1,700 feet difference between the highest and lowest extremes of Tennessee valley. The arable surface of Tazewell and Wythe counties, from which the fountains of Kanawha and Holston have their origin, must be at least 2,000 feet above the Atlantic tides; whilst that of Ohio river, at the influx of Tennessee, but little exceeds 300 feet. The difference is fully an equivalent for 4° of latitude, and accounts for the rapid changes of climate experienced on lines of latitude in Tennessee. The current of every branch of Tennessee is very rapid, though direct falls are rare, and even dangerous shoals are not common. Of the latter, those particularly called Muscle Shoals, between Lauderdale and Lawrence counties, Alabama, are most remarkable and difficult to navigate. The whole river, however, having a mean fall exceeding two feet to the mile, is only favorable to down stream navigation, which it admits in most of its branches to near their sources. Tye river, a small river of Virginia, rising in the Blue Ridge, and flowing southeastward into James river, after draining part of Nelson and Amherst counties, and by one of its constituents, Piney river, forming for some few miles the boundary between those counties. York river of Virginia, formed by two main branches, Pamunky and Mattapony. Below the union of its constituent streams, York river is rather a bay, varying from two to three miles in width, extending to the S. E. 27 miles, and thence east 12 miles, into Chesapeake, between York and Gloucester counties. Below the junction of Pamunky and Mattapony ririvers; York bay does not receive a tributary above the size of a small creek. It admits ships of any size to or near the Great Bend at Yorktown, but above admits only coasting vessels. Including all its tributaries, 8 the valley of York river lies between those of James and Rappahannock. The greatest length 120 miles from the mouth of York river to the extreme source of North Anna river, in South West mountain; but, if taken with this extent the mean width would not exceed 20 miles, and at the utmost breadth, only about 45 miles. The area 2,600 square miles. Extending in lat from 37° 15′ to 38° 16′, and in long from 0° 41′ E. to 1° 22′ W. of Washington. Youghioghany river of Pennsylvania, Maryland and Virginia, having its most remote sources in Preston county of the latter state, but deriving its most numerous southern tributaries from the valley between the Back Bone and Laurel mountains, Alleghany county, Maryland. From this elevated tract the main stream flows nearly due north 35 miles, enters Pennsylvania between Fayette and Somerset counties, within which it thence flows about eight miles direct course to where it is joined by Castleman's river, an equal or probably a superior stream, entering from the N. E. Some of the southern fountains of Castleman's river, rise in Alleghany county, Maryland, but the greater part of its tributaries flow from Somerset county, Pennsylvania, and rise in the same valley with the confluents of Youghioghany. Below the union of the two main branches the Youghioghany assuming a northwestern course, continues in that direction 60 miles to its junction with the Monongahela at MacKees port, in Alleghany county. Where Youghioghany is traversed by the United States road at Smithfield, the water level is 1,405 feet above that of the Atlantic. The extreme heads of this stream have an elevation exceeding 2,500 feet, the mouth being elevated about 700 feet, the entire fall must be 1,800 feet. The whole valley of Youghioghany is either mountainous or very hilly and broken. CLIMATE. The following article was received too late for insertion in its proper place, but we insert it here as affording some evidence of attention and observation upon a subject of which our men of science have been too negligent; and which requires the joint and persevering labor of many hands to afford any thing like accurate detail or valuable information. At the discovery of our continent it presented an immense forest untouched by human labor. The majestic rivers of the new world, swelling by every shower, inundated the whole country, and left in their track numerous marshes and extensive lakes. The woods were hid with rank luxuriance, while the exuberant undergrowth of herbs, shrubs, and weeds, gave to the prospect that gloomy and repulsive solitude which was so aptly described by the first settlers as the wilderness. The earth could not retain the heat of the sun, nor could this effect be produced by the mass of foliage. The air stagnated in the forest. Offensive exhalations arose from the numerous marshes, and the accumulated decay of vegetation, while the whole land was rife with the pestilence of malaria. We cannot always arrive at definite conclusions of the climate of any country by barely measuring its degrees of distance from the equator. Its character is controlled by many other direct causes. Extent of territory— nature of soil—height of mountains and elevation above the sea, greatly affect it. The extent of our northern seas, with the ice which continues there from year to year, gives to every wind which blows over them an intense cold. A chain of gigantic mountains spread their snow-capped summits throughout the heart of our continent. The winds which blow over them become deeply surcharged with cold, whose piercing severity is not diminished until it has extended far down upon our southern sea coast. Our daily experience attests the truth of this fact. The climate of Virginia has not been stationary. To trace its characteristics is to follow the varying passions of the coquette—now enticing by seductive smiles—and now chilling by capricious frowns. Yet it is the clime under whose genial influence we have been bred, and we can easily forget its vicissitudes in the glittering canopy of life and beauty which it throws around every scene. Those who have dwelt amid the sunny clime of Italy—the fierce heat of Spain, and the elastic air of France, can appreciate from the test of comparison, the softness of a Virginian day—and how splenetic soever we may be, it never has gloom enough to make us "damn it as a lord." Captain John Smith, in his faithful and spirited History of the Colony of Virginia, makes many allusions to its climate, and with a proper allowance for his zeal in coloring the advantages of a settlement in the colony, we may receive his statements as the honest opinions of a careful and accurate observer. "The sommer (says he) is hot as in Spaine, the winter cold as in France or England. The heate of sommer is in June, July, and August, but commonly the cool breezes asswage the vehemency of the heate. The chief of the winter is halfe December, January, February, and halfe March. The cold is extreme sharpe, but here the proverbe is true `that no extreme long continueth.' Sometimes there are great droughts, other times much raine, yet greater necessitie of neither, by reason we see not but that all the raritie of needful fruites in Europe may be there in great plentie by the industrie of man." In an earnest appeal to the friends of the colony, he again recommends it for the "mildness of the ayre and the fertilitie of the soyle." This sketch of the colony is studiously silent as to the existence of marshes, though much of the ill health of the first emigrants, may be traced to them.* * In the reply of Governor Berkeley to the enquiries of the Lords Commissioners of Foreign Plantations, in 1671, he states "that all new plantations are for an age or two unhealthy, until they are thoroughly cleared of wood." 2 Hen. Stat. at Large, 515. In giving an account of the bays, rivers, and brooks, our author incidentally remarks that "by the rivers are many plain marshes containing some twenty, some one hundred and some two hundred acres. But little of grasse there is but what groweth in low marshes." In the advance of population and agricultural improvement, these marshes were gradually reduced. Mr. Nathaniel Caussey, who had lived in Virginia with Captain Smith, states in the year 1627, "that whereas the country was heretofore held most intemperate and contagious by many, now they have houses, lodging, and victuals, and the sun hath power to exhale up the moist vapors of the earth where they have cut down the woods, which before it could not, being covered with spreading tops of high trees, they find it much more healthful than before." Captain Butler, a gallant pioneer of the new world, and at one time governor of Bermuda, on his return to England from Virginia in the year 1624, presented to Charles I, a pamphlet entitled, "The unmasked face of our colony in Virginia as it was in the winter 1622." In this work he draws a lamentable picture of the struggles of the infant colony, and asserts "that the English plantations are generally seated on marshes, lakes, and infectious bogs, which have subjected the planters to the inconveniences and diseases prevalent in the most unhealthy parts of England." This pamphlet excited much hostility against the Virginian Company, which was artfully fermented by Charles I. who was then secretly planning the ruin of that noble and patriotic association. Some of the members of the company who had been in Virginia united in an address to the public, in which they state "that they had found the air of Virginia to be as wholesome and the soil for the most part as fertile as in any part of England." The House of Burgesses in a curious memorial of resentment, ill humor, and personal sarcasm, pronounced the charges of Capt. Butler to be false and slanderous, and informed the king "that no bogs have been seen here, by any that have lived here twice as many years as Capt. Butler did weeks in the country—the places which he so miscalls being the richest parts of the earth, if we had a sufficient force to clear their woods and to give the fresh springs which pass through them a free passage. The soil is generally rich and restores our trust with abundance. The air is sweet and the clime healthful, all circumstances considered, to men of sound bodies and good government." In 1624 the Virginian Company in petitioning parliament for encouragement and protection, earnestly recommended the colony "for that temperature of climate which agreed well with the English." Smith often makes similar comparisons, and it is evident from the writings of our earliest historians, that the climate of Virginia differed but little from that of England. The immense mass of vegetation which overshadowed the country, filled it with fogs and vapors, assimilating it to that of England, and rendering it extremely cold in its winters, and tardy in its summers. It was less affected by the standard temperature of the sea than England, and was marked with more striking vicissitudes. The cold winter of 1607, which was felt throughout all Europe* * In this year at Paris the beard of Henry IV. was frozen in bed cum regina. Sully's Mem. Vol. IV. 262. was, in the lauguage of Smith, found "as extreame in Virginia." There were also many unseasonable years, and others singularly propitious to the agriculture of the country. The year 1610 was long recollected by the epithet of the starving time, while in the year 1619 two crops of rare-ripe corn were made. Among many of the acts of the House of Burgesses regulating the trade of the country, we find one which prohibits the exportation of Indian corn "on account of the unseasonableness of the last two summers." As the country was gradually cleared of its forests and undergrowth, the climate became dry, temperate, and warm. The act of the House of Burgesses of 1705, which directed the capitol to be built at Williamsburg, recites, "that this place hath been found by constant experience to be healthy and agreeable to the constitutions of this his majesty's colony and dominion, having the natural advantages of a serene and temperate air, and dry and champaign land." A correspondent to the Royal Philosophical Society, who wrote an account of Virginia about this period, says "that the winters are dry and clear—the spring is earlier than that of England. Snow falls in great quantities, but seldom lies above a day or two, and the frosts, though quick and sharpe, seldom last long. July and August are sultry hot, while September is noted for prodigious showers of rain. The north and N. W. winds are either very sharp and piercing, or boisterous and stormy, and the S. E. and south hazy and sultry." From the want of accurate observations, and those careful collections of meteorological facts which elucidate the character of all climates, our speculations on that of Virginia must be necessarily vague and indefinite, and for the nicer shades of its changes, we are forced to substitute the broader features of its outline. Our climate is uniform only in its sudden vicissitudes. Its consistency is impaired by many causes, which have produced a difference of temperature dependant on the deeply marked geographical distinctions of our sea board, tide water, valley, and mountainous regions. My observations have been principally confined to that intermediate country, between the Chesapeake and the South West Mountains, on the low and moist lands of the Matapony, in latitude north 38° 6′, and about seventy miles south of Washington City. While I am forced in my examination of the temperature of other parts of the state, to rely on statements often inaccurate in their conception and irrelevant in their details. The standard temperature of every country is regulated by that of the level of the ocean. According to the researches of Professor Leslie, the mean temperature at the level of the sea, in our latitude, is between 67° and 71°, which gradually diminishes from that level, until it reaches the point of perpetual congelation. Pure air is not heated by the sun's rays which pass through it. The solar rays must be stopped by the earth, collected and reflected before any heat can be given to the atmosphere. In taking a standard, we assume the sea, which affords a fairer criterion of uniform temperature, than the mean heat of springs and wells. Neither does the sea retain the extreme of heat or cold which we find in the earth. A cold wind blowing over this volume of salt water, necessarily cools its surface, which from its increase of specific gravity, sinks and gives place to an inferior warmer wave. The action of the wind in rippling the surface of the water, and the influence of tide and currents conspire in bringing the warmer water to the level of the sea to mitigate the coldness of the wind: this action continues till the whole water is so far cooled that it becomes susceptible of frost. When frozen it is no longer warmed from the inferior water, but blows on with increased rigor. A warm wind takes a portion of cold as it passes over the surface of the sea, and becomes reduced to the mean temperature of that body. The sea breeze so prevalent in Eastern Virginia is cool, as much from the standard heat of the ocean, as from its rapidity of motion. It is cooler in Virginia than in the West Indies, and often since the opening of the country, spreads its elastic freshness to the foot of the South West Mountains. There is a sensible and striking difference between the temperature of Eastern and Western Virginia. The former from its vicinity to the sea coast, becomes tempered into more gentleness; while its earlier vegetation shows the greater power of its soil to retain heat. In the latter the winters are longer and more severe, yet the farmer may there admire the wisdom of that providence, which in increasing the rigor of the frost, mellows and crumbles the land for the purposes of agriculture, while the light soils of the east require no such agency. In the course of five years, from 1772 to 1777, Mr. Jefferson made many observations on the temperature at Williamsburg, and having reduced them to an average for each month in the year, he has given us the results of the greatest daily heat of the several seasons.* * Notes on Virginia, Query 7. I have before me a series of careful observations compiled by that accurate thinker, and accomplished scholar, the late David Watson, (of Louisa county,) in a similar period of five years, from 1823 to 1828. His residence was near the South West mountains, and in a country comparatively thickly covered with wood. The result of his observations and those of Mr. Jefferson, making a distance in time of 52 years, and of southern latitude in favor of Williamsburg, is here submitted: MR. JEFFERSON'S. January, 38½° to 44° February, 41 to 47½ March, 48 to 54½ April, 56 to 62½ May, 63 to 70½ June, 71½ to 78¼ July, 77 to 82½ August, 76¼ to 81 September, 69½ to 74¼ October, 61¼ to 66½ November, 47¾ to 53½ December, 43 to 48¾ MR. WATSON'S. January, 36 to 44 February, 35 to 40 March, 44 to 49 April, 56 to 60 May, 61 to 69 June, 71 to 79 July, 80 to 84 August, 81 to 84 September, 74 to 77 October, 59 to 63 November, 46 to 54 December, 40 to 44 The coolest and warmest parts of the day were separately added, and an average of the greatest cold and heat of that day was formed. From the averages of every day in the month, a general average for the whole month was deduced. In following this mode of analysis, there are many slight features of discrepancy between the statements of Mr. Jefferson and Mr. Watson, which considerably impair the correctness of the comparison. Mr. Watson's thermometer was suspended in a passage, far removed from the action of fire, in a house constructed of wood, and the calculation of his table is based on observations made between the hours of 10 A. M. and 3 P. M. Mr. Jefferson is silent as to the situation of his thermometer, while it appears that he has reckoned from the hours of 8 A. M. to 4 P. M. The hottest period of these five years, observed by Mr. Watson, was in July, 1825, when the thermometer on several days rose above 90°, and the hottest month was in August, 1828. The coldest period was during the month of January, 1827, and the warmest winter was in 1828-29. My own observations made during a period of four years, from 1829 to 1834, cannot be calculated for an average temperature. Many days and even months from my absence from home, were necessarily unnoticed. Those periods which are recorded differ but little in their particular and daily results, from those of Mr. Watson; while I have noticed his singular omission—the prevalence of the winds, and the "fantastic tricks" with which our climate so playfully disports. From my observations, I am induced to place the mean temperature of our climate at 55°; thus varying according to natural and artificial causes several degrees from the standard temperature of the sea. The year 1831 was characterised by many vicissitudes of heat and cold. On the 27th February the mercury sunk to 7°, while in July and August it frequently rose to 86° and 94°. The ensuing winters of 1831 and 1832 were uncommonly rigorous, snow fell in great quantities, and in many places continued on the ground till the 4th of March. Early frost did much injury to vegetation, while the cold was but slightly removed from the earth until late in the ensuing summer. The spring of 1834 was attended by severe frosts, which resembled in their destructive character, those which had rendered the year 1816 proverbial. They committed great devastations in April, and on the 15th, 16th, and 17th of May, the Indian corn on our low lands, and the leaves of the garden and forest trees were scathed and blighted to a degree precluding, in many cases, all hope of restoration. In Virginia the transitions from heat to cold are sudden, and sometimes to very extreme degrees; often in the day time the mercury will stand at 94° or 81°, and will fall in the course of a few hours to 60° and 50°. Mr. Jefferson informs us that the mercury has been known to descend from 92° to 47° in thirteen hours. I have frequently noted vicissitudes of a similar kind, and when the change is accompanied by a S. E. wind and rain, the air becomes cold, raw and disagreeable. We have few summers in which a fire is not often required. On the 1st of May, 1827, there was a light fall of snow at Gloucester Court House,* * Dr. Rush in his essay on the climate of Pennsylvania, mentions a fall of snow at Philadelphia on the night between the 4th and 5th May, 1774. while it is not uncommon to see slight frosts in August. In our winter the cold weather, though severe, is short, and the frequent snows of the night are generally removed before the sunset of the ensuing day. Water in ponds is slowly congealed, and rarely makes ice thick enough for preservation, until it has been chilled by a fall of snow—again, its production is very rapid; rivers half of a mile in breadth, will be frozen over in the course of one night, sufficiently firm to bear men and horses.† † Mr. Jefferson tells us that in 1776 York river was frozen over at York town, and in 1780, Chesapeake bay was solid from its head to the mouth of the Potomac. The cold winters of 1784 and 1814 still live in the recollections of tradition. In the month of January, 1827, many of those short yet wide salt streams, which wash the shores of Gloucester county, were frozen to the extent of thirty or forty feet from the land. This rigorous cold is rarely of much duration. Sustained, and principally created by north and northeastern winds, it quickly yields to the shifting of the wind to any other point. Some of our winters are so temperate and mild, that the cattle can find a support in the woods. Vegetation has been observed in all the winter months, and in the latter part of December diminutive pears, peaches and apples, fully ripened, have been gathered from the trees. A rose, exposed in an open garden, bloomed throughout the whole winter of '28 and '29. In this winter the peach tree bloomed in the latter part of January, and produced in its regular season a plentiful crop of fruit. Many of our coldest days are succeeded by gentle and moderate evenings; our severest cold is about the latter part of January, generally commencing after a hard rain, and continuing on an average about six days, thus realising the truth of that old Virginian proverb, "that as the day lengthens the cold strengthens; a rapid thaw, often accompanied with rain and east winds, then takes place, while warm days and moderate nights soon reduce its severity, and open the way for the premature approach of spring. "Halfe of March" is no longer winter. Spring has already scattered her vivid mantle o'er the scene, while the whole air is redolent of life and fragrance. Yet even its brightness is momentary—an unexpected frost often shows that the frown of winter still lingers on the land, and we too frequently find a practical illustration of Shakspeare's metaphor, "The tyrannous breathings of the north, Checks all our buds from blowing." It is now stormy, variable and cold; now calm, gentle and warm, and now dry, peaceful, and serene. Until the middle of May our climate presents one incessant tumult of rain and drought, frost and heat; yet a spring uniformly cold is far more favorable to our agriculture, than its usual uncertain temperature for suppressing vegetation, it protects it from the blighting frosts of March and April. Often during the spring months the weather is excessively damp, cloudy and hazy. In March, 1833, the sun was obscured for more than thirteen days, while every thing was chilled into gloomy melancholy. The vegetation of this season affords us a criterion of the heat of the spring, which may be received in aid of the more accurate results derived from the thermometer. In the course of four years I have found these average periods of time suststained by careful observations. Peach blooms from March 7 to March 14. Apple blooms from March 20 to March 29. Cherry blooms from March 13 to March 17. Plum blooms from March 26 to March 31. Strawberry blooms from March 24 to March 31.* * At the residence of R. G. Esq. near the Natural Bridge in the valley of Virginia, these fruit trees in the year 1834, bloomed at the following periods. Peach April 1. Apple March 30. Plum April 1. Strawberry April 15. About the latter part of May our summer has commenced: the air becomes dry, warm and elastic, and the verdure of the forest assumes a more deepened hue of vivid green. The superabundant moisture of the earth acquired during the winter, is now thoroughly evaporated, and the temperature of the season in dispelling lassitude, invigorates into activity. Summer burns on with a bright and glowing splendor, alternately relieved by gentle showers and refreshing breezes. Occasional droughts of many weeks in duration, parch the luxuriance of the vegetation—they are succeeded by copious and heavy showers of rain, which quickly restore the withered prospect. The approach of autumn is marked by heavy fogs in the morning and evening, which are soon dispelled, leaving that calm and serene temperature, which gives to this season all the beauty of tranquil repose. In every season there is a large and constant exhalation from the earth in the shape of vapor, its volume being proportioned to the heat of the day. We do not often observe this exhalation when the heat of the atmosphere differs in a small degree from that of the earth; when the temperature of the air is considerably lower, this vapor so soon as it has arisen is deprived of a part of its heat, while its watery particles are more closely attracted into union and become visible in the shape of fog. In the autumn of Virginia, the heat of the day is sufficient to produce a large ascent of vapor. Undisturbed by currents of wind it easily condenses, and is thickened by calm and chilling nights into a heavy mist, which in the guise of a cloud finds its resting place on the earth. Autumn of all other seasons, is least liable to sudden and extreme vicissitudes. The approach of winter is alike gradual and uniform, and though we have frequent light snows, the mildness of autumn is rarely wasted away until late in December. In reasoning from the researches of philosophy, we are taught to place but little reliance on the uncertain narratives of tradition; they, however, with a slow yet steady advance, acquire respect, and often mould theory into fact, and fashion opinion into fixed principles. The common belief that our climate has been changed into a milder temperature, has taken most of its certainty from the statements of our old people, who are uniformly consistent in this particular. The bloom of the orchard trees formerly restrained by a protracted winter from premature expansion, rarely failed arriving at the maturity of fruit; the earth remained covered with snow for many weeks, and the winter did not, as now, dally with the wantonness of spring. The marshes, uncleared lands, ponds and lakes, which conspired to absorb the heat of the earth,* * This principle is apparent from the fact that marshy countries are always cold; the decrease of temperature after a violent rain, also proves its truth. An unusual evaporation carries off the heat of the earth, and may we not reasonably expect a cold winter after a wet summer? have been almost obliterated or greatly reduced. There is a lesser quantity of snow, and more of rain, while the frequency of violent storms of wind in the spring and summer, distinctly prove the great mass of our local heat, and accumulated electricity. The winds of Virginia are singularly fickle and capricious, possessing neither the uniformity or regularity of those which blow at the tropics. Our prevailing wind is the south west, which assumes, alternately, gentle and severe characteristics. The frequency of southwestern winds above the latitudes of the trades, flows as a necessary consequence, from the continuance and direction of the vast currents of air. It moves unconfined and unresisted over the sea, until it reaches that unbroken range of mountains, which towers from one extremity of our continent to the other. It strikes against them, and from its elasticity rebounds with great velocity, in a direction opposed to the forcing powers of the trades, taking in its oblique movement all those features which mark our southwestern wind. During the spring the N. E. is the most common wind. The huge masses of snow and ice at the north pole, are gradually melted by the heat of the sun; great quantities of vapor during this time are exhaled and remain suspended, augmenting both the weight and bulk of the atmosphere. That wonderful and mysterious agent, electricity, in dispelling the vapor and converting it into elastic air,† † Through a glass tube filled with water, Dr. Franklin passed an electric shock, the tube was shattered to pieces, and the water disappeared, a similar experiment was tried with a tube filled with ink on a sheet of white paper, the same effects were produced, the paper being neither stained nor discolored. gives an impetus to that wind which issuing from the poles, takes a northeastern direction as it advances southerly, (its diurnal motion being less than that of the earth,) and falls surcharged with snow and rain on every portion of our country. Mr. Jefferson made 3698 observations on the various points from which our winds blew, noting their changes two or three times in each day. The prevalence of the S. W. winds, over those from other quarters is thus numerically stated by him: South West, 926. North, 611. North East, 548. East, 521. North, 409. West, 351. South East, 223. South, 109. He has also made a comparative view of the difference between the winds at Monticello and Williamsburg. He has reduced nine months' observations at Monticello, to four principal points, being perpendicular to, or parallel with, our coasts, mountains, and rivers, viz: the N. E., S. E., S. W., and N. W. He has also reduced an equal number of observations, 421, from his table above, taking them proportionally from every point. 9 My own observations made many times in each day, amount to 749, without reducing them in the proportionate manner of Mr. Jefferson. I have submitted them under the points and heads which he has adopted: N. E. S. E. S. W. N. W. Total.

Days. Days. South West, 122 North, 26 North West, 89 South, 21 North East, 61 West, 12 East, 30 South East, 4 302 63 302 days 365 A curious phenomenon is sometimes witnessed during a severe wind from the S. W.; a thin vapor or scud is seen moving with great velocity below the clouds, from the N. E., there being two currents of air of directly contrary courses in active motion at the same time. In the early part of the spring and autumn, in dry seasons, about sunset it is common to meet with currents of warm air, small in their extent yet extremely rapid in their movements; they are considerably above the heat of the human body, and are wayward and eccentric, both in their duration and extent. Their existence has given rise to much speculation, and even the experienced philosophy of Mr. Jefferson has succumbed to the mystery* * May they not proceed from that latent electricity, which pervades the air most in dry seasons, and which is attracted to the human body by its heat,—thus producing from the action of affinity, the feeling of sudden warmth? of their origin. Our frosts are sometimes equally severe and unexpected. No body placed near the earth has a temperature of its own, but is entirely regulated by that of the earth. A violent storm of rain, by absorbing much of the heat of the earth, is often followed by a destructive frost. When the power of frost reaches a certain pitch, the vapors dispersed throughout the air, yield their latent heat—the atmosphere becomes clouded, the frost is either destroyed or mitigated, and the vapors descend in rain or snow. Our hardest frosts never penetrate the earth more than three inches, and though the leaves of the trees and shrubs are scathed or destroyed, and timber sometimes splits in the direction of the fibres of the tree, its roots uniformly remain uninjured. Those portions of vegetation which grow nearest to the earth, and those in low and marshy situations, receive the severest injuries. On the night of the 17th May, 1834, the leaves of the oak, hickory, and all the forest trees, were blighted in most of their foliage; the sycamore only remained unhurt. Frost during the winter, is a fatal enemy to those plants which are nurtured in southern exposures; they are sometimes covered with snow, which melting rapidly, is converted in the course of the night into destructive ice. Our white frost is generally harmless, it being simple dew slightly congealed. Dew is found in Virginia in heavy masses, generally in the months of August, September, and October; it lies in greater quantities on our flat than high lands, being collected there during the absence of the sun from the horizon, like the relics of a drizzling rain. It appears first on the lower parts of bodies, because in the evening the lower atmosphere is first cooled and most disposed to part with its vapor. Virginia is subject to rains of vehement and long continuance; they fall in the largest quantity about the breaking of the winter, and in March and September. I have no data on which to reckon their depth* * According to the observations of Dr. Sanders, made near Boston during ten years from January, 1, 1821 to January 1, 1831, there were on an average in each year, 219 days of fair and 146 of cloudy weather. Rain fell more or less on 57 days. Boston is on the sea coast, in lat 42° 20—58′, and the standing temperature of the level of the sea at that place is between 59° and 60 Farenheit. or their prevalence over the fair and cloudy days of our climate. Our valley and western regions, by the condensing power of their mountains, and our tide water sections, by the attractive force of broad rivers, have more local rains than the intermediate country, and do not suffer in the same proportion from continued droughts. If a year be remarkable for rain, it is fair to conclude that the ensuing winter will be severe, from the great evaporation of the heat of the earth, and if the rains have been violent, sterility and barrenness will follow in the next year in proportion, as the surface mould, so vital to vegetation, has been scattered and wasted away. Our Indian summer presents an ample field for the creations of fancy and the conceits of theory. It generally follows excessive and protracted droughts, and is dispersed by heavy rains. It has been traced to electric influence— to the burning of mountains—to the existence of numerous impalpable atoms of decayed vegetation, and has been assimilated to those light gray clouds which overhang Peru. Adhuc lis est subjudice. POLITICAL AND MORAL CONDITION. Having given a summary account of the natural condition of Virginia, reserving a more detailed account for the particular counties; we now proceed to give a similar succinct description of the situation of her people, begining with their number and classes. POPULATION. The number of people in Virginia has been as follows, at the several periods mentioned, viz: in 1790,—747,610—in 1800,—880,200—in 1810,— 974,622—in 1820,—1,065,366—and in 1830,—1,211,375.—At the last period the population was divided as follows, among the several counties, viz: EASTERN DISTRICT.

In the same period, the free whites increased 180,020, or 35 per cent; the free colored persons 27,224, or 135 per cent; and the slaves, 123,961, or 36 per cent. For the ten years preceding the census of 1830, the rate of increase of the whole population diminished considerably, and the relative increase of the several classes varied from the foregoing results. On the whole population, the rate was reduced from 37½ to 13½ per cent.; on the free white, from 35 to 15 per cent; on the free colored, from 135 to 28¼ per cent.; and on the slaves from 36 to 10½ per cent. It is to be observed, however, that, while the black population of the whole state has been diminishing, when compared with the white, the reverse is true in respect to Eastern Virginia, which is peculiarly the slave region; for, while, in 1790, there was in that district a majority of 25,000 whites, the slave and free colored population outnumbered them at every successive census, until, in 1830, the excess was upwards of 81,000. The facts thus exhibited show that Western Virginia, which contains comparatively few slaves, has rapidly increased its white population in the last ten years, the rate of increase amounting to 25 per cent,; while, on the eastern side of the mountains, the increase of the whites, in the same period, did not exceed 7½ per cent. The greater multiplication of blacks in Eastern Virginia, notwithstanding constant deportation to the southern and southwestern states, may be partly ascribed to the mild treatment which they generally receive from their owners. On the other hand, the evil effects of slavery, and the policy of adopting some scheme for gradual abolition, are topics which have been freely and earnestly discussed, and have already arrayed the Virginians into two powerful parties. The slow progress of the white population, compared with some of the other states, when so many propitious causes exist for its advancement, has been urged as a prominent objection to slavery. Indeed, the march of its aggregate population has fallen far short of the predictions of former times. Mr. Jefferson, in his Notes, which were written in 1782, estimated that the then existing stock, unaided by foreign emigration, would be multiplied to 2,270,000 by the year 1835, exceeding, by upwards of a million, the result of the last census. That the increase of numbers has been restrained by powerful checks seems reasonable; but to point out their true character and operation, belongs rather to the department of moral and political philosophy. This state is now divided into one hundred and eleven counties; whereof sixty-six are on the eastern side, and forty-five on the western side of the Blue Ridge mountains. Six new counties having been added since the taking of the last census, and revision of the constitution; they were erected by act of Assembly 1831-2, viz:—Page county, formed out of parts of Shenandoah and Rockingham—Rappahannock, formed out of a part of Culpeper county—Smyth, formed out of Washington and Wythe—Floyd, from a part of Montgomery—Jackson, out of part of Mason, Kanawha and Wood—and Fayette, formed out of parts of Greenbrier, Nicholas, and Kanawha counties. GOVERNMENT AND LAWS Constitution.—The first constitution of this state was formed and adopted in 1776, and continued in operation until October, 1829, when a convention met at Richmond to alter and amend it, or frame a new one: on the 14th of January, 1830, the present constitution was adopted by a vote of 55 to 40. The amended constitution on being submitted to the legal voters of the state was ratified by a majority of 10,492 votes, as appears by the following statement. For. Against. Transalleghany District, 2,123 11,289 Valley District, 3,842 2,097 Middle District, 12,417 1,086 Tide-Water District, 7,673 1,091 Total, 26,055 15,563 Legislature.—The first election of members of the House of Delegates, and Senate, under the amended constitution, took place on the several court days in the month of October, 1830, in the different counties and boroughs entitled to representation: and the first General Assembly convened at Richmond on the first Monday in December, 1831. By this constitution the legislative power is vested in a Senate and a House of Delegates, which are together styled the General Assembly of Virginia. The House of Delegates consists of 134 members chosen annually;—31 from the Trans-Alleghany district;—25 from the Valley district;—42 from the Middle district;—and 36 from the Tidewater district. The Senate consists of 32 members;—13 from the counties west of the Blue Ridge;—and 19 from the country east of that mountain. The Senators are elected for four years, and the seats of one-fourth are vacated each year.—In all elections to any office or place of trust, honor, or emolument; the votes are given viva voce.—A reapportionment in both houses, is to take place every ten years, commencing in 1841; until which time there is to be no change in the number of delegates and senators from the several divisions; and after 1841 the number of delegates is never to exceed 150, or that of senators 36. Executive.—The executive power is vested in a Governor elected by the joint vote of the two houses of the General Assembly. He holds it three years, commencing the 31st of March after his election, or on such other day as may be from time to time prescribed by law; and he is ineligible for the three years next after the expiration of his term of office. There is a Council of State, consisting of three members, elected for three years by the joint vote of the two houses; the seat of one being vacated annually. The senior counsellor is Lieutenant Governor. The present executive officers are L. W. Tazewell, Governor, Daniel A. Wilson, Lieut. Governor, Council. Wyndham Robertson, Council. Peter V. Daniel, Council. Lawson Burfoot, Treasurer of State, James E. Heath, Auditor, James Brown, Jr., Second Auditor, William Selden, Register of the Land Office. Judiciary.—The Judges of the Supreme Court of Appeals, and of the Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery, are elected by joint vote of both houses of the General Assembly, and hold their offices during good behavior, or until removed by a concurrent vote of both houses; but two-thirds of the members present must concur in such vote, and the cause of removal be entered on the journals of each house. The present Court of Appeals consists of Salary. Henry St. George Tucker, President, 2,720 Francis T. Brooke, Judge, 2,500 William H. Cabell, Judge, 2,500 Wm. Brockenbrough, Judge, 2,500 Dabney Carr, Judge, 2,500 The Judges are entitled to receive, in addition to their salaries, 25 cents a mile for necessary travel. The Court of Appeals holds two sessions annually; one at Lewisburg, Greenbrier county, for the counties lying west of the Blue Ridge, commencing on the 1st Monday in July, and continuing 90 days, unless the business shall be sooner despatched; the other at Richmond, for the counties lying east of the Blue Ridge, commencing at such times as the court may, from time to time, appoint, and continuing 160 days, unless the business shall be sooner despatched. General Court.—The state is divided into 10 districts, and each district into two circuits, and a Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery is held twice every year in each county and corporation; the courts sitting until the business is despatched. There are 20 Judges, having each a salary of $1,500, and their names, with the number of their respective circuits, are as follows: 1. Richard F. Baker, 2. John F. May, 3. Abel P. Upshur, 4. William Brown, 5. J. T. Lomax, 6. John Scott, 7. John B. Clopton, 8. William Daniel, 9. William Leigh, 10. Fleming Saunders, 11. Richard H. Field, 12. Lucas P. Thompson, 13. Richard E. Parker, 14. Daniel Smith, 15. Benjamin Estill, 16. James E. Brown, 17. Allen Taylor, 18. Edward D. Duncan, 19. Lewis Summers, 20. Joseph L. Fry. County Courts.—Justices of the Peace who constitute these Courts are elected by the Governor, upon nomination of the existing County Courts. Four Justices constitute a Court for the trial of civil, and five for criminal causes. Their civil jurisdiction in law and equity is concurrent with that of the Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery in cases of trover or detinue, and others involving greater value than $50; and below that amount but over $20, it is exclusive. Their criminal jurisdiction is concurrent with that of the same Court in petit larceny, and all other offences of free persons not exceeding the grade of misdemeanors, and in the case of slaves exclusive as to all offences. The Justices receive no compensation; but the lucrative office of Sheriff is conferred upon one of their body, generally the eldest Justice, and for two successive years, when he gives way to the next oldest in commission, &amp;c. These Courts are established by the Constitution, but their jurisdiction, is settled by law. Right of Suffrage is extended to every white male citizen of the commonwealth, resident therein, aged 21 years and upwards; who was qualified to exercise the right under the former constitution and laws,—or who own a freehold of the value of $25;—or who has a joint interest worth $25, in a freehold,—or who has a reversion, or vested remainder in fee expectant on an estate for life or years; of which he shall have been possessed for six-months, unless obtained by descent, devise, or marriage;—or who shall own and be in occupation of a leasehold estate, recorded two months before he offers to vote, of an annual value of $20, and original duration of at least 5 years;—or who has been housekeeper or head of a family for 12 months, and been assessed with, and has paid taxes. But paupers, persons of unsound mind, non-commissioned officers, soldiers, seamen and marines of the U. States, and persons convicted of infamous offences cannot vote. As connected with this subject we insert here the Civil List of Virginia;—prepared in compliance with a resolution of the House of Delegates of the 8th of March, 1833. CIVIL LIST, Shewing the nature and extent of the duties of each officer of the Government and their Salaries. Governor, salary $3333 33.—The governor is ex-officio president of the literary fund, the board of public works, the James river company, and the northwestern turnpike company, for which several services he receives no additional compensation. Lieutenant Governor, $1000; two Councillors, $1000 each.—The lieutenant-governor is not now a director of either of these boards. In case of the death or resignation of the governor, he is entitled to the chief magistrate's salary in lieu of his own. Neither the lieutenant-governor, nor the other members of the council, have any perquisites of office. Secretary of the Commonwealth, $1620 00; Assistant Clerk, $1000 00; Copying Clerk, $200 00.—The secretary or clerk of the executive department is also keeper of the seals and librarian, by virtue of his office. He is entitled to a fee of $1 67 upon each testimonial granted from the executive department, and to commissions, at the discretion of the joint library committee, upon sales or exchanges of books belonging to the library fund. These perquisites, it is understood, are very inconsiderable. Neither the assistant nor copying clerk is entitled to any other compensation besides his salary. Clerk of the Council, $500 00:—Keeps the journal of the council, and performs various other duties, for which he has no perquisites. Door-Keeper to the Council, $500 00.—The door-keeper to the council is also keeper of the capitol keys, but is entitled to no compensation besides his regular salary. The incidental expenses of the executive department during the past fiscal year, amounted to $1,193 61, including fuel, stationery and postage. President of the Court of Appeals, $2750 00; Four Judges of the Court of Appeals, $2,500 each.—The president and judges are entitled, exclusive of their salaries, to twenty cents per mile for travelling to and from the respective courts they are required to attend. Clerk Eastern Court, $1000 00; Clerk Western Court, $1000 00.— This allowance of $1,000 to each of the clerks of the court of appeals, is the maximum fixed by law, but the judges may in their discretion reduce it. The clerks are entitled to their regular fees from individuals, but to no other compensation from the state. The judges are authorized to appoint a crier and tipstaff to each of the courts held at Richmond and Lewisburg, and to fix their compensation. The crier at Richmond received, during the last fiscal year, $729, and the tipstaff, $608 31; and the incidental expenses 10 for fuel, stationery, &amp;c amounted, in the same period, to $193. The contingent expenses at Lewisburg, owing to the short terms of the court, are very inconsiderable. Twenty Judges of the Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery, nineteen at $1,500, and one at $1,800.—The judge of the superior court of Henrico receives $1,800 annual salary. The other judges, $1,500 each; and all are entitled to 15 cents per mile for travelling through their circuits and to the general court. Clerk of the General Court, $500 00.—The fees of the clerk of the general court are very inconsiderable. Attorney Superior Court Henrico, $300 00; Clerk Superior Court Henrico, $100 00.—An act concerning the superior court of Henrico, passed 29th March, 1823, fixes the compensation of the attorney and clerk of that court, and makes them, in effect, salaried officers. The clerk is moreover entitled to his fees for services rendered the commonwealth, which will probably average about $40 per annum. Attorney General, $1000 00.—The attorney general is entitled to fees when recovered from defendants; but owing to the diminished number of judgments against public debtors, his fees have not averaged more than $40 per annum for the last two years. Treasurer, $2000 00.—The treasurer is ex-officio a director of the board of public works, the James river company, the literary fund, and the northwestern turnpike company. He is moreover, by virtue of his office, a director of the Virginia bank, and treasurer of the Cincinnati fund, which is in his possession. He has no perquisites of office. First Clerk, $900 00.—The first clerk of the treasurer has charge of the books in which the accounts of the commonwealth are kept, distinguished from those which relate to speciffic funds, the latter being confided to the second clerk. Both, however, perform indiscriminately the current duties of the office. The incidental expenses of the treasury office during the last fiscal year, embracing fuel, stationery, sweeper, &amp;c amounted to $152 38. Auditor of Public Accounts, $2000 00.—The auditor is ex-officio a director of the James river company, the board of public works, the literary fund, and the northwestern turnpike company. He is also, in conjunction with the governor, lieutenant-governor, and second auditor, one of the commissioners for transporting the free people of color. He has no perquisites nor extra compensation, except a fee of 50 cents for each redemption of delinquent land. The late laws on that subject have reduced these fees to an average of thirty or forty dollars per annum. His general duties are to audit all claims against the commonwealth, and to collect and disburse the public revenue. Clerk of Accounts, $1400 00.—The clerk of accounts has in his peculiar charge the public books of account, prepares all the revenue statements and the lists of balances, and performs a variety of duties connected with his department. First Clerk, $900 00.—The first clerk represents the auditor in his absence, and during such time, is entitled to extra compensation at the rate of $166 67 per annum. He has special charge of the vouchers upon which warrants are issued, assists the auditor in the revenue settlements, and performs various other duties. Second Clerk, $750 00; Third Clerk, $600 00.—The second clerk has charge of the delinquent land lists, and in common with the third clerk, performs a variety of duties appertaining to the current business, such as examining and correcting commissioners' books, insolvents in the revenue, and militia fines, &amp;c. &amp;c. The auditor is also authorized to employ an extra clerk, in his discretion, at the rate of $50 per month, growing out of the accumulated labors of the office from revolutionary claims, &amp;c. The incidental expenses of the office in the last fiscal year, including stationery, fuel, and sweeper, and excluding postage, amounted to $280 75. The postage alone amounted to $1,050. Second Auditor, $1800 00.—The second auditor is an ex-officio director of the James river company, board of public works, literary fund, and northwestern turnpike company, and audits all the accounts appertaining thereto. He is moreover superintendent of the literary fund, and clerk to the board of directors. He is also ex-officio secretary to the board of public works, and one of the commissioners for removing free people of color. He is entitled to no extra compensation. First Clerk, $900 00; Second Clerk, $600 00.—The first clerk represents the second auditor in his absence, and when necessary, acts as clerk to the literary fund, and secretary to the board of public works; keeps the books of the James river company and board of public works, and assists the second auditor in the current business. The second clerk keeps the books of the literary fund and northwestern turnpike company, and attends to other duties. The incidental expenses of the office, and of the several boards connected therewith, for the past fiscal year, embracing, fuel, stationery, sweeper, pay of messengers, and clerks of boards, postage, printing, and miscellaneous expenses, amounted to $1,172 64. Register of the Land Office, $1500 00.—The register's duties are principally defined in the general revised land law of 1st March, 1819. He has no perquisites, his fees of office being required to be paid into the treasury. First Clerk of the Land Office, $900 00.—The first clerk receives and examines surveys, &amp;c. and issues grants, &amp;c. Second Clerk, $600.—The second clerk is engaged principally in recording. The incidental expenses of the land office the past fiscal year, including fuel, stationery, parchment for grants, and sweeper, amounted to $625 29. Public Printer, $2600 00.—$1,000 of the public printer's salary is paid quarterly. The residue annually, after the completion of the sessions acts. The salary is exclusive of extra printing. The amount paid during the last fiscal year for printing legislative documents, extra copies of the acts and journals of the library, &amp;c. &amp;c. amounted to $1,836 64, which is probably about a fair annual average. Superintendent of the Penitentiary, $2000 00; First and Second Assistant Keepers $700 each; Third, Fourth, Firth, Sixth, and Seventh Assistant Keepers, $600 each.—Neither the keeper nor assistant keepers receive any extra compensation. The auditor is not informed as to the particular distribution of duties among the assistants. The 6th and 7th assistants were for the first time so denominated in the act of 8th March, 1833. They were previously called turnkey and delivery clerk. Clerk, $600 00.—The clerk keeps the accounts of the institution, and acts as clerk to the board of directors. He has no perquisites. Five Directors, at $150 each.—The directors are paid annually, at the rate of $3 per day, for each day's attendance; not to exceed $150.

General Agent or Store-Keeper to the Penitentiary.—The agent for selling penitentiary manufactures is allowed a commission of seven per centum upon sales, in lieu of salaries to himself and clerks. Adjutant General, $500 00.—For the various laws respecting the adjutant general, see 1 Rev Code, pages 94 95, 96 and 98, and Supplement, pages 60, 64, 81 and 84. Vaccine Agent, $500 00.—The allowance is paid semi-annually, on the order of the executive. The auditor is informed by the agent that there are numerous applications for vaccine matter. No perquisites of office. Superintendant of the Westham Magazine, $150 00.—It is understood that no duties are now required of this officer, the magazine not being used. Keeper of the Rolls and Clerk of the House of Delegates, $200 00.— The clerk of the house of delegates is ex-officio keeper of the rolls, and it is in the latter character, that he is entitled to the stated salary of $200 per annum. As clerk, his allowance was fixed at $150 per week, by the act of 16th February, 1822. Out of this weekly allowance, the clerk of the house of delegates employs an assistant in the office during the sessions of the legislature, and defrays the expense of enrolling and engrossing the acts. Besides his official duties during the session, he is required after the adjournment of the legislature, to arrange and cause to be published, with marginal notes and indexes, the laws of that body. His perquisites consist in fees for certified copies of the acts of assembly, but it is understood that they amount to a very inconsiderable sum. The incidental expenses of the office of the clerk during the last fiscal year, including fuel, stationery for the house of delegates, binding journals, parchment, &amp;c. amounted to $333 48.—Total amount of Civil List, $74,553 33. Though not strictly within the terms of the resolution of the house of delegates, it is perhaps required by its spirit, that the allowances to the officers of the general assembly, so far as they have been fixed by law, should be added. The speaker of the senate is entitled, under the act of 16th February, 1822, to $6 per day, mileage and ferriages. The speaker of the house of delegates, to $8 per day, mileage and ferriages. The clerk of the senate, to $75 per week. The sergeant at arms to the senate, to $30 per week. The sergeant of the house of delegates, to $28 per week, and fees for arrests. The clerks of each of the committees to the house of delegates, to $35 per week. The door keepers to both houses, each to $28 per week. The printer to the senate, to $600 for the session. The only clerks of committees of the house of delegates, whose allowances were fixed by the act of 16th February, 1822, were those of propositions and grievances, elections and claims, courts of justice, and roads and navigation. Other clerks of committees have been occasionally appointed, and their wages paid by a special clause in the annual appropriation law. It may also be proper to add, that pursuant to the resolution of the general assembly of 21st February, 1833, the executive has employed an agent to examine certain revolutionary documents, with a salary of $1,200 per annum. LAWS. On the third of July, 1776, the convention which met to adopt a constitution for the state, having declared it independent, passed an ordinance declaring that "The common law of England, all statutes or acts of Parliament made in aid thereof prior to the fourth year of the reign of King James the first, and which were of a general nature and not local to that kingdom, should be considered as in full force, until the same should be altered by the Legislature." After this the Legislature re-enacted by special acts all of the statutes of the British Parliament which they thought applicable and necessary; and on the 27th December, 1792, declared that no statute or act of Parliament should have any force or authority within this commonwealth,—saving all judicial and remedial writs which might have been sued out before that act. The common law, the constitution and statutes of Virginia, the constitution of the United States and the laws and treaties made in pursuance thereof, constitute the whole law of Virginia. RELIGION. Although the bill of rights, in 1776, declared that all men were equally entitled to the free exercise of religion, according to the dictates of conscience, yet the first constitution contained no express provision on the subject. The legislature, in 1785, passed an act for establishing religious freedom, and subsequently repealed all laws which recognized the Protestant Episcopal Church as the legal establishment. The glebe lands, and other church property, were vested in the overseers of the poor, for charitable uses, reserving only to the living incumbents an estate for life, and exempting the church buildings from confiscation. The new constitution of 1830 fully recognises absolute religious freedom as a part of the fundamental law. The Episcopal church, which, after the loss of its revenues, suffered almost total extinction in Virginia, has revived, in the last twenty years, by the voluntary support of its friends, and is now distinguished by numerous and wealthy members, and by a pious and intelligent clergy. In 1834 the number of ministers in the State, including two bishops, was 59, churches, 58, and 2840 communicants. In the same year, the Presbyterians numbered 117 churches, 100 ministers, 11,413 communicants; the Methodists, 168 ministers, communicants 34,316 whites, and 7,447 colored, total 41,763; the Baptists, 261 ministers, churches 450, and communicats 54,302, of whom it is conjectured that one-half are slaves. The precise distinction between the regular Baptists and the Reformers, called the disciples of Christ, not being in all cases drawn, there is no coming to any thing like certain knowledge, but it is supposed they do not exceed 10,000 in number, neither are they so systematically arrayed as to afford any accuracy in their statistics, either as to the number of teachers, congregations, meeting-houses, &amp;c. Attempts are now being made for a better arrangement of their affairs. The increase of new members, for the last two or three years, has been so great that it has not been possible to keep pace with the demand for preachers, meeting-houses, &amp;c. They have advanced in the U. States, within 10 years, from a few in number, to something like 150,000. The Catholics have 5 ministers, and 10 congregations; but the number of lay members is not ascertained. It will be perceived that the Baptists and Methodists are the most numerous sects in the state; and the estimate does not include a considerable number of separatists from both communions. Besides these, there are Friends, Lutherans, Dunkers, Unitarians, Jews, &amp;c. scattered through the state, whose numbers are not accurately known. The Presbyterians have a theological seminary in Prince Edward, and the Episcopalians one near Alexandria, both of which institutions have flourished by private liberality. The state, in its political capacity, has always manifested a strong jealousy of all ecclesiastical establishments; yet the Virginians are generous in private contributions towards objects of religion and benevolence. Sunday schools, and societies for promoting temperance, African colonization, &amp;c., have been extensively patronized in late years. EDUCATION. Literary Fund—This Fund was established by the Legislature in 1809, by devoting the proceeds of all escheats, fines, and forfeitures, to the encouragement of learning. In 1816 it was encreased by the liberal appropriation of the debt due from the United States to Virginia, on account of advances made by the State in the late war with Great Britain. The permanent capital of this fund amounted, in September, 1833, to $1,551,857 47 Of this there was invested in stocks, loans and debts, $1,551,803 34 Leaving in the treasury to the credit of the fund, 54 13 To which balance must be added the undrawn school quotas, amounting to $20,256 74 First deducting the amt invested in bank stock, of 7,150 00 13,106 74 Which leaves a total balance to the credit of the fund of $13,160 87 The revenue arising from this fund amounted, in 1833, to $78,340 61 Of which there was expended 62,927 18 Leaving a balance, to encrease the capital, of $15,413 43 When the Legislature appropriated the United States debt to this fund, it at the same time gave $230,000, and an annuity of $15,000 from the fund, to the University of Virginia. Primary Schools—The sum of $45,000 annually has been appropriated from the revenue of the Literary Fund, to the different counties, in proportion to their white population, for the sole purpose of instructing poor children in the elements of learning. This sum is placed under the management and control of School Commissioners, appointed by the Court of each county. The primary school system has been modified from time to time since its establishment,—and is now under the control of the Second Auditor, who renders an annual report to the Legislature, of the disbursement of the fund, founded on the returns of the county commissioners.—As the public bounty is confined to the offspring of indigent parents, a plan is now partially in operation, by which contributions may be received from individuals to establish schools free for all classes of pupils; and strong hope is entertained that the experiment will prove successful, notwithstanding the difficulties which arise from the mixed population of one portion of the state, and the scattered population and rugged surface of the other. Experience has already demonstrated the utility of even the existing system, and thousands who must have groped through life in the darkness of ignorance, have had the cheering light of knowledge shed upon them by means of the primary schools. We annex the Second Auditor's abstract of the number of poor children taught in each county, the expense, &amp;c. for the year 1832-3: ABSTRACT of School Commissioners' Reports for the year 1832, received between 30th September, 1832, and 1st October, 1833.

COLLEGES. William and Mary—This institution, which is at Williamsburg, formerly the capitol of Virginia, and next to Harvard College, the oldest in the United States, derives its name from William and Mary, sovereigns 11 of England, by whom its charter was granted in 1691. It received with its charter a grant of £1,985, 20,000 acres of land, and a penny a pound on tobacco exported from Virginia and Maryland; and it was further aided by private donations, particularly by the munificence of the Hon. Robert Boyle. In 1693, the Assembly of Virginia ordered that it should be built at Williamsburg, and made some additional grants, so that its annual income became upwards of £3,000; but it was subsently greatly diminished.—"The funds," as recently stated by the President of the college, "consist of bonds, stocks, lands, and houses, amounting in all to about $150,000, not yielding, however, a revenue in proportion to the amount."— "No regular list of students or graduates, has been kept till within the last few years; the number, therefore, of alumini we cannot determine; but it is certainly greater than from any other college south of the Potomac.— Owing to peculiar circumstances, the graduates have always been few. Nine-tenths of the students have gone through one course without applying for a degree." Many of the most eminent men of Virginia were educated here. The condition of the college, at different periods, has been very variable; but, after a period of declension, it has had, for some years past, a considerable degree of prosperity. It is under the legislative government of a board of 24 trustees who supply the vacancies in their own body. The college edifice is a large misshapen pile of buildings. The college library contains 3,500, and the students' library, 600 volumes. The Rev. James Blair, D. D. was named president in the charter, but is said not to have entered upon the duties of the office till 1729; he died in 1742, and was succeeded by the Rev. William Stith, who died in 1750.— The Rev. James Madison, D. D. (Bishop of Virginia,) was president from 1777 to 1812. His successors have been the Rev. W. H. Wilmer, Dr. J. Augustine Smith, and the Rev. Dr. Adam Empie. Faculty in 1833—Rev. Adam Empie, D. D., Pres &amp; Prof. Mor. Phil. William B. Rogers, Prof. Chemistry and Nat. Philosophy. Dabney Brown, Prof. Humanity.

For a senior student $185. The law course commences at the opening of the college, and terminates on the Saturday before the last Monday in April. Expenses, board, washing, and fuel, $90; tuition $20, matriculation $5;—total, $115. The grammar school opens on the 15th of October, and closes on the 1st of August. Expenses, board, including every thing, $100; tuition $20;— total $120. Hampden Sydney, in Prince Edward county: Washington College, in Rockbridge. Randolh Macon, at Boydton, in Mecklenburg co: are all flouriching institutions, and a full account may be seen of them in their respective counties. We pass on to the principal literary institution of the state, the University of Virginia.—The legislature of Virginia at the session of 1817-18, adopted measures for establishing an institution then proposed to be named Central College, and 24 commissioners were appointed to select a site for it. They accordingly selected a pleasant and elevated spot nearly two miles from Charlottesville, in the county of Albemarle, not far from the centre of the population of the state. Their choice was confirmed by the legislature in 1819, and an act was passed incorporating the institution by the title of the University of Virginia, which went into operation in 1825. It was erected and endowed by the state; and it owes its origin and peculiar organization chiefly to Mr. Jefferson. It has a fine collection of buildings, consisting of four parallel ranges about 600 feet in length, and 200 feet apart, suited to the accommodation of 9 professors and upwards of 200 students; which together with the real estate, cost $333,996. It posseses a very valuable library of 10,000 volumes, and a philosophical apparatus, which together cost $36,948. The state gives annually $15,000 for the support of the institution. The whole annual income of the University is about $18,500. The professors are paid partly by a fixed salary and partly by fees received from the students; but the sums which they severally receive are widely different, varying in ordinary years from $1,600 to $3,500. The plan of this University differs materially from that of other institutions of the kind in the United States. The students are not divided into four classes, with a course of studies embracing four years; but the different branches of science and literature here taught are styled schools, and the student is at liberty to attend which he pleases, and graduate in each, when prepared. The first degree was conferred in 1828—the number of graduates in that year was 10; in 1829, 12; 1830, 30; 1831, 20; 1832, 46; total, 118; of these 16 were graduates in ancient languages; 14 in mathematics; 23 in natural philosophy; 9 in chemistry; 17 in moral philosophy; 22 in medicine; and 17 in law. The title of "Master of Arts of the University of Virginia," was conferred on one student at the commencement of 1832, and on several in each year since. To obtain this title it is necessary to gradaute in the several schools of mathematics, ancient languages, moral philosophy, natural philosophy, chemistry, and by a recent enactment in some two of the modern languages.

All companies are to be officered with a captain, four lieutenants, five sergeants, and six corporals each; volunteer companies are permitted to adopt their own by-laws, and the commandants thereof to appoint the time for their extra musters; fines for failing to attend such extra musters to be imposed by the courts of enquiry, to be collected by the sheriffs, and paid to the treasurers of such companies, to be disposed of by the companies as they may deem proper; all uniformed volunteer companies to be armed. The act exempts from militia duty, (except in time of war, insurrection or invasion,) all members of volunteer companies who produce to their regimental courts of enquiry, certficates from their commanding officers of seven years service. Companies of artillery equipped with ordnance, to be allowed one dollar per day for each horse employed in drawing their artillery and caissons, and the governor is authorized to require any company of artillery to perform the duties of light artillery. The uniform of the respective corps of the militia, to be the same with that of the United States' army, unless the governor, by proclamation, shall otherwise order; but volunteer companies now uniformed, are not required to change their uniform. Battalion courts of enquiry to be held in October or November, and regimental courts in November or December; the act authorizing boards of the officers of the different regiments to be convened at any time to transact any other business of the regiment other than the assessment or remission of fines.

This state has two lunatic asylums one is located in eastern Virginia, at Williamsburg, James city county, the other in western Virginia, at Staunton, Augusta county. There were in the lunatic hospital at Williamsburg, on the first of January, 1834, 37 male and 18 female patients—total 55.— During the year 1833, nine died, and three were discharged. The aggregate expense for the support of this institution during the past year, was $9,250 87, according to the director's report. In the lunatic hospital at Staunton, there were on the 28th day of December, 1833, 19 male, and 18 female patients—total 37; during the same year, one died. There was expended for the support of this establishment, during the past year, $6,078 31, according to the report of the committee. A considerable addition is now being made to the building of the last mentioned asylum. PENITENTIARY. We believe this system has been as successful in few states, as in Virginia. The annexed table exhibits the fact that it is only necessary to send back again one in (nearly) every twenty-one; which seems to exhibit a very successful reformation:—whilst the reports of its fiscal concerns prove that so far from being a burthen, it brings to the State a small annual revenue. To punish crime, and reform the criminal, without expense to the state, is the object in view—our system certainly attains the latter completely, and approximates, in a very beneficial degree, to the former: A TABLE shewing the number of convicts, received in the Penitentiary of Virginia, from the time it was opened in 1800, with the pardons, deaths, escapes, and discharges in each year, until the 30th of November, 1833, and the number remaining on that day.

It was then provided, that three months of solitary confinement should be suffered at the commencement of each person's term, and three months more at the close. This law continued in force until the 27th February, 1829; when it was provided that the first three months should be omitted; but the three months at the close of the term was continued until the 9th of March, 1833, when solitude was reduced to one-twelfth part of the whole term and not to exceed one month at any one time. The wall round the prison was not erected till 1824.

Virginia is considerably behind her sisters New York and Pennsylvania in the extent of her improvements. For this several reasons may be assigned; first, her habitual caution and prudence in legislation, requiring demonstration of its utility before she will embark her capital in any new enterprize; second, the sectional jealousies of different portions of the state, the interest of several often conflicting, with regard to any specific improvement proposed; third, the mismanagement of her first enterprizes in this field, have contributed to dampen her ardour ever since. Of late she seems to be more inclined to arouse from her lethargy. There is a permanent fund devoted to the purpose of internal improvement; by a report in Sept. 30, 1833 this fund amounted to $1,423,661 11, to which may be added a disposable fund of $966,847 80, [of which however $61,111 11 is at present improductive] making in all $2,415,586 50; from which the annual income is $144,934 00. This fund is managed by 13 directors styled the "Board of Public Works; of which board the Governor, Treasurer, and First Auditor are ex officio members. The board meets annually on the first Monday in January. The members receive $4 per diem, and 20 cents a mile for travelling. The views of Governor Tazewell upon this subject are interesting:— "Another great Corporation connected with the fiscal concerns of the Commonwealth, is "the Board of Public Works." This institution was established in 1816, and endowed with all the stocks then held by the state in different Turnpike and Canal Companies, in the Bank of Virginia and the Farmers' Bank of Virginia, and with all the interest the state might acquire thereafter as a bonus or premium for the incorporation of other Banks, or for the increase of their capital, or the renewal of their charters. These funds and their proceeds, although nominally much greater, cannot be justly estimated, in money, at more than about two millions of dollars, which may now, therefore, be considered as constituting the capital stock of the Corporation. The receipts from this capital are equal to about $115,000 annually. "The object of this institution, was to invest its annual profits, and the proceeds of such part of its capital as it might be thought judicious so to invest, in any work of Internal Improvement, promising when completed, to be of advantage to the Commonwealth, and profitable to the other proprietors of it. But aware of the difficulties that would attend the judicious selection of such works, the authors of the Corporation established a rule, by which it should be governed in every case. When any work of Internal Improvement was proposed, if after the requisite surveys of it had been made, and its cost estimated, by officers and at the expense of the Corporation, three-fifths of the capital deemed necessary for the completion of such a work was subscribed by individuals, the residue was to be taken by the Corporation, and paid for by it rateably with the sums advanced by the private stock-holders. "If this scheme had been carried into full effect according to the original plan, it seems quite obvious, that all the funds of the Corporation would have been ultimately invested in the stocks of comparatively small undertakings, to the completion of which the enterprize and unaided capital of individuals would have been perfectly adequate: while great works, the very magnitude of which would prevent the combination of a sufficient number of individuals to subscribe the proportion necessary to secure the co-operation of the state, would never have been carried into effect. Thus, while some partial improvements might have been made, no work of general and permanent utility would have been accomplished, and the great object of the Corporation must have been defeated. The discovery of this was at last made; but not until more than $900,000 of the capital of the institution had been invested in undertakings since abandoned, or in those the profits of which are quite inconsiderable, or much less than the average rate of profit in the country generally. "To remedy this defect, a modification of the original plan was adopted. The Commonwealth assumed upon itself, exclusively, the completion of certain great Internal Improvements, in which, from their very nature, the cooperation 12 of a sufficient number of individuals could not be expected, leaving all others, deemed of less general utility, to the support of the Board of Public Works. Thus the subject of Internal Improvement has become divided into parts—in one of which the state is concerned exclusively, while in the other, the Board of Public Works is but a co-partner with individuals. "The effect of this division of the public interests, has been attended with some hazard already, and unless much discretion is used hereafter, will be ruinous to the Board of Public Works, and seriously oppressive to the state itself. The funds of the Corporation not being equal to the immediate accomplishment of all the great objects in which the Commonwealth was concerned exclusively, and to the advancement, at the same time, of the others in which the Board of Public Works was interested as a co-partner with individuals, to supply the deficiency, resort was had to loans. The payment of the interest and the reimbursement of the principal of these loans were charged, in the first instance, upon the stock for the benefit of which the loans had been effected, but should this prove insufficient, the funds of the Board of Public Works were made subject to these payments; and should a deficiency still exist, the Treasury itself was made accountable for it. "The example of relying upon loans for the accomplishment of such public works being once set, was soon followed in the case of works to be constructed at the joint charge of the state and of individuals. Large sums have been borrowed to enable the payment of the subscription of the Corporation to these works also. The payment of the interest and the reimbursement of the principal of these loans, were charged, in like manner, upon the corporate funds, in the first instance, but should these prove insufficient, the Treasury itself, as before, is made chargeable with any deficiency. "Thus it has happened, that while a considerable portion of the capital of this Corporation has been invested in stocks absolutely unproductive, or very nearly so, the whole of this capital is now charged with the payment of the interest and reimbursement of the principal of large debts, for which the Treasury itself is ultimately liable. As yet, the income of the Corporation is equal to the satisfaction of all its expenses, and to the payment of the interest charged upon it. It is believed also, that the capital is sufficient to discharge the principal of all these debts. But should any additional burthen be imposed upon this Corporation, at this time, it is probable that its means would not suffice to meet all its engagements, without impairing this capital. In that event, it is obvious that ere long, the whole weight of all these engagements must fall upon the Treasury, when to preserve the credit of the state, new and burthensome taxes must be imposed upon the people. "To prevent such a result, I recommend to you most earnestly, that no new charge be imposed upon this Corporation, at present. In a few years, it is expected very confidently, that all the works in which it is concerned and which are now in progress, will be completed. Unless individuals have been greatly deceived in their estimates of the effects of these works, the funds invested in them will then become productive. The profits of this capital, or its proceeds will then enable the easy and speedy reimbursement of the debts with which the Corporation is now charged. The whole funds of the Board will then become applicable to other undertakings; and the work of Internal Improvement may again proceed with increased vigor and advantage. But if a different course is pursued, the ruin of this Corporation may be the too probable consequence—grievous taxation must follow as the necessary effect of its ruin; and the work of Internal Improvement will receive a shock from which it will not recover for a long period. "As a fiscal agent, the Board of Public Works has been, and under judicious management will continue to be, of great advantage to the Commonwealth. So long as its plans meet public approbation, it will call into useful action the unemployed capital of individuals, making this productive to its proprietors, and beneficial to the community. The very debts which it may be compelled to contract occasionally, will effect all the beneficial results, without producing any of the evils attendant upon a public debt— provided they are confined to a limit, within which the income of the Corporation, after satisfying its expenses, will certainly pay the interest, and its capital surely reimburse the principal. But if a different course is adopted, this Institution, instead of being an useful fiscal agent, will be worse than useless. It will then become positively mischievous, acting as a perpetual drain of the Treasury and exhausting its funds, repleted often as its coffers must be, by heavy exactions from the people." Navigation East of the Appalachian System.—The eastern part of Virginia is peculiarly favored in facilities for water transportation, in the immense and deep bay of Chesapeake and its large tributaries, the James, the York, the Rappahannock, and the Potomac. The earth affords no other instance of so great a physical change in so short a distance, as that between the shallow sounds of North Carolina, and the deep water of the Chesapeake; in the latter the largest ships of war have adequate depth almost to the very verge of the primitive rock; ships of the line ascend the main bay nearly to its head,—the Potomac to Alexandria,—some distance into York river,—and up James river to the mouth of Nansemond; sloops drawing six or seven feet water penetrate into innumerable creeks upon both sides of the bay. Nature seems also to have been especially liberal to this state in the peculiar direction of the channels of her rivers, making her eastern border a common recipient of all flowing east of the Appalachian System. The rivers of Georgia and the Carolinas, from Alatamaha to Cape Fear inclusive (and we might say without much violence to Roanoke) flow S. E. or S. S. E.: but from the southern border of Virginia to the Susquehannah they flow east, and the latter river south. Much has been done to improve the navigation in eastern Virginia, but little when compared with the extent of country and the number of lines of communication inviting attention. James River is navigable for vessels of 250 tons to Warwick, and 125 tons to Rocket's, the port of Richmond. At that city commences the falls or rapids, to pass which by a navigable canal, the old James River Company was chartered in 1784, and were collecting tolls in the year 1794. (See Richmond, Henrico County.) The Richmond canal entered a basin on the western side of the city, it was 25 feet wide, and 3 deep, and extended originally 2½ miles to its junction with the river, in which space there are 12 locks, and a fall of 180 feet. Three miles above the falls there was another short canal, with 3 locks, overcoming a fall of 34 feet. These canals and locks, with other slight improvements opened a tolerable navigation of 12 inches water to Lynchburg. In 1825 the James River Company declared canal navigation complete to the head of Maiden's Adventure falls, in Goochland County, a distance of 30½ miles from Richmond. The width of the canal is 40 feet, depth of water 3½ feet, and the expense was $623,225; the fall overcome was 140½ feet. This last improvement was probably in proportion to its magnitude the most promptly executed work at that time accomplished in the United States. Besides these there is another canal through the Blue Ridge, about 7 miles long, and 30 feet wide, overcoming a fall of 100 feet. James River and Kanawha Communication.—The necessity of opening a complete communication between the Ohio and Chesapeake by this line, has been felt by all classes in Virginia, indeed it is admitted that without it she must sink to a very low ebb when compared with her more enterprising sisters, in wealth, population, and importance. There has already been expended on this line of improvement $1,274,583, of which $638,883 86, have been expended on the lower James River Canal, the old and new improvements,—$365,207 02 on the mountain canal,—$87,389,81 on the Kanawha,—and $171,982 49 on turnpike roads and bridges from Covington to the Kanawha; but these improvements though of great local advantage to the sections of country in which they are situated, by no means establish a continuous communication. To effect this all-important object the Legislature in 1831-2, granted a charter of incorporation to the James River and Kanawha Company, with a capital of $5,000,000. This charter was at first liberal, but has since been most particularly and specially favored by the Legislature, for the purpose of inducing individual subscription; exempting the shares from taxation, making the charter perpetual, allowing the Banks to subscribe, and subscribing for the state an amount far beyond her usual proportion in improvements, &amp;c. These advantages, and the unremitting exertions of some patriotic citizens, have (it is believed) procured the necessary amount of subscriptions, and it is probable that the noble work will be commenced in the spring of 1835. No human foresight can see the limit of the advantages attendant on its success, or the evils of its failure.* * The first Message of Governor Tazewell contains the best history of the legislation upon this subject which we have seen. "One of the great Corporations created for purposes of Internal Improvement, in which the Commonwealth is now concerned exclusively, is "The James River Company." The origin of this must be sought for as far back as the year 1784. In that year, the General Assembly passed an Act, whereby they incorporated a Company under this name, with a capital of $100,000, divided into 500 shares, of $200 each, for the purpose of clearing and extending the navigation of James River, from tide-water upwards, to the highest parts practicable on the main branch thereof. By several other acts passed afterwards, it was declared, that the highest place practicable within the meaning of the first act, was Crow's Ferry at the mouth of Looney's creek in the county of Botetourt, and the capital stock of the Company was increased to 700 shares. Of these shares, the state became a subscriber for 250, with which the Board of Public Works was afterwards endowed, as a part of its capital, when this Institution was created in 1816. After the work for the accomplishment of which this charter was granted, had been completed, or very nearly so, it was thought beneficial to the state, to improve the navigation of James River beyond the highest point first fixed, to the mouth of Dunlap's Creek—to make a convenient road from thence to the great falls of the Kanawha River; and to make the last mentioned river navigable from the great falls thereof to the river Ohio. But as their charter imposed no such obligations upon the then existing Company, it was necessary to enter into a new contract with it, for that purpose. This was accordingly done, by an act passed in February 1820. Under this new act, the state undertook to pay, semi-annually, to the Stockholders of the James River Company, a dividend upon their stock of 12 per centum per annum for several years, and of 15 per centum per annum forever thereafter. The state undertook further, to carry into effect the contemplated improvements, by appropriating to that purpose the requisite funds; and in consideration of these things, the Company assigned to the Commonwealth, all their tolls and income of every kind. The state having thus acquired all the interest of the original stockholders in this Company, the General Assembly abolished the former Directory of the Company, by an Act passed in 1823, and appointing a new Directory of the same, committed the management of its concerns to this body. To enable the accomplishment of the object specified, sundry Acts were passed by the General Assembly, from time to time, authorizing the Directory to borrow large sums of money. For the payment of the interest of the sums so to be borrowed, and of the annuity aforesaid, all the income of the Company was appropriated to that purpose; and the General Assembly pledged its faith, that it would provide such other revenues as might be necessary. Until such other sufficient funds should be provided, however, so much of the revenue of the Board of Public Works as might be necessary to supply the deficiency, was expressly pledged. Under this authority, the President and Directors of this Company have borrowed at various periods since the authority was given, and at various rates of interest, sundry sums of money, the aggregate of which amounts now to $1,324,500; and the total amount of the annual interest thereon is computed at $76,563 50, exclusive of the perpetual annuity of $21,000 payable to the original stockholders of the Company, for the surrender of their charter. In 1832, the policy which seems to have guided the course of legislation upon the subject of the James River Company until that time, appears to have been changed. Until then, the policy had directed, that the Commonwealth should possess the exclusive control over this great institution. To give complete effect to this policy, the state had expended much more than a million and a half of dollars in completing the work. But on the 16th of March 1832, a joint stock company was again incorporated, provisionally, to effect the great purpose of connecting the tide water of James River with the navigable waters of the Ohio. The capital of this company was to be $5,000,000 divided into shares of $100 each. To this stock, the state stipulated, that, she would subscribe at once ten thousand shares, or $1,000,000, to be paid for by a transfer of the whole interest the Commonwealth held in the works and property of the James River Company; and when three-fifths, or more, of the capital stock should be taken by others, the state agreed, to subscribe for the residue of the $5,000,000, be this what it might. Time until the second Monday in December 1832, was allowed, for making up the subscription of the private stockholders, but before that day another act was passed, extending this time to the 3d Monday in December 1833, and this extended time was again prolonged by another Act, passed by the last Assembly, until the 31st of December of the present year. The latter Act binds the Commonwealth to subscribe for the remainder of the capital stock of the contemplated company, whenever one moiety of it, or more, should have been taken by other subscribers. In this state of things, while the faith of the state is pledged to comply with the conditions proposed by itself, provided these conditions are accepted by others, I feel myself restrained from offering a single remark as to the justice or policy of the contemplated scheme. The proffered contract must be carried into effect by the Commonwealth, be its effects what they may, provided those to whom the proffer has been made accept its terms, on their part, within the time limited. But should these terms not be accepted within the time prescribed, I would recommend to your most serious consideration a careful revision of them, if a further extension of the time is hereafter proposed. In any event it will be wise to provide some means now, by which the debt due by the James River Company may be ultimately reimbursed, because, whether the proposed arrangement be completed or not, the payment of the principal of this debt will remain as a charge upon the state exclusively. Although the payment of the perpetual annuity to the original stockholders in this Company, as well as of the annual interest due to the lenders of the large sums borrowed to carry on this great work, is well and amply provided for already, no provision has ever been made for the reimbursement of the debt itself. It is true, that no part of this is yet payable, nor will become due for many years, but sound policy requires that whenever a debt is contracted, funds adequate to the extinction of it, at some time or other should be seasonably appropriated to that object. Should this be omitted, there is always hazard, that the debt will not only become permanent, but that its amount will constantly augment; and while this tends, by its influence, to generate great inequalities in a state, it must in time disturb its legislation, impair its credit, and produce effects upon its currency which cannot be foreseen or prevented. As a fiscal agent, the James River Company has been of no benefit as yet. The income of this Corporation has not sufficed to satisfy its own expenses, the perpetual annuity due to the original stockholders, and the interest of the sums borrowed to carry on its works. Owing to this cause, the ability of the Board of Public Works has been much cramped of late, by the necessity imposed upon that body to provide for the deficiency, out of its funds. But the resources of the James River Company have been much influenced for several years last past, by the shortness of the crops usually transported to market by the works of that Company, by the reduction of the rate of its tolls, as well as by various casualities; which it is to be hoped will not again occur. When these causes shall cease to operate, the income of this Company will be augmented of course; and if ever its annual resources shall suffice to meet all its annual engagements, it must become a most valuable institution, not only to all those who may then be directly interested in it, but to the public and to the Treasury; provided this income be made liable to the reimbursement of the principal, and to the payment of the interest, of the debt due by the company, for which debt the Commonwealth is ultimately bound." Dismal Swamp Canal is another important improvement, it is said to have been the first canal commenced in the United States, and nearly the last finished,—it is 22½ miles in length, 40 feet wide, and 6½ deep, it passes from Deep creek to Joyce's creek at the head of Pasquotank river, and connects the waters of the Chesapeake with those of Albemarle sound, it is partly in Virginia and partly in North Carolina. This canal was finished, upon a circumscribed plan in 1822. Its dimensions have since been enlarged. Every quarter of a mile, the canal is widened to 60 feet for turnout stations. The locks newly constructed correspond in dimensions with those of the Chesapeake and Delaware canal; and the old ones may be so altered when necessary, without great difficulty. The summit level is 16½ feet above the Atlantic at mid-tide, and is supplied by a feeder of five miles' length from lake Drummond. The basin at Deep creek, is half a mile in length, and 15 feet above the level of tide-water. The Northwest canal connects Northwest river [which empties into Currituck sound in N. Carolina] with the main canal, requiring a cut of 6 miles. This canal is 24 feet wide, and 4 feet deep. The Appomatox has been improved from its mouth 10 miles to Fisher's bar, and around the falls 5 or 6 miles above Petersburg. Danville and Dan river canals are a series of improvements upon the upper branches of the Roanoke river, upon which in Virginia and North Carolina, the Roanoke company have expended about $350,000. Shenandoah Canals are on the river of that name, and near Port Republic in Rockingham county. A fall of 50 feet is overcome by six short canals with stone locks; by which this river is rendered navigable nearly 200 miles. The Rappahannock has been improved by locks, dams, and canals, from Fredericksburg to Fox's mills, about 40 miles. This work was done by a joint stock company—$30,000 of the stock belonging to individuals, and $20,000 to the state. North-Western Turnpike. We extract an account of this road from Gov. Tazewell's first message, sent to the Legislature Dec. 1st, 1834: "Another great Corporation in which the Commonwealth is exclusively concerned, is that styled `The President and Directors of the North-Western Turnpike Road.' This was created by an act pased in the year 1831. Its object was, to construct a road from the town of Winchester, in the county of Frederick, to some point on the Ohio River to be thereafter selected; and the Corporation was authorized to borrow, on the credit of the State, a sum or sums of money not exceeding $125,000, for the accomplishment of the object of its creation. During the last session of the General Assembly, an act was passed, empowering the Corporation to borrow, on the credit of the Commonwealth, for the purpose of the road, a further sum not exceeding $86,000. "Under the authority given to it by these several acts, the Corporation has borrowed the sum of $121,000 only, as yet, which may be considered as the present capital stock of this institution. For the payment of the interest, and the final redemption of the principal of all the sums borrowed, the nett proceeds and surplus tolls which may arise from the road, after keeping the same in repair, were pledged and appropriated, by the terms of the charter. But should these funds be found inadequate, the General Assembly has stipulated to provide other and sufficient revenues for these purposes; and until such other sufficient funds shall be provided by law, so much of the revenue of the Board of Public Works, not otherwise appropriated, is pledged, as may be necessary to supply the deficiency. "Although great progress has been made towards the completion of this work, it is not yet finished. No profits, therefore, have been derived from it; but it has hitherto acted as a drain of the income of the Board of Public Works, whose revenue is bound to provide for the payment of the interest on the capital borrowed. It is expected, however, that this improvement will be so far completed during the next year, that it may then be made productive; and when finished, but little doubt is entertained, that the income derived from its tolls, will not only keep it in repair, and satisfy the interest on the capital borrowed to construct the work, but will suffice, in time, to reimburse the lenders of this capital. It will then become a valuable fiscal agent." Railroads, though but of late introduction into the United States, have attracted considerable attention in Virginia; one has been lately executed styled the Chesterfield Railroad, near Richmond. The results of this road are more brilliant in proportion to its extent, than those of any similar work in the Union. It is about 13 miles long, and connects the coal-mines of Chesterfield with tide-water. The whole capital invested in it, including cars for transportation, stables, horses, &amp;c. was $150,000. The trade on it is already 50,000 tons per annum, and the receipts for transportation during the year 1833 were $70,000. The stock is of course at a high premium. The Petersburg and Roanoke Railroad was the second which went into operation in the state, which it did in midsummer 1833; the cars running daily between its extreme points. This road commences at Petersburg, and extends 60 miles a little W. of S. to Weldon, in N. Carolina, and the foot of the falls of Roanoke river; the line is very direct, and the graduation in no place exceeds 30 feet per mile, and the curves have radii of from 2 to 4 miles. Great part of the profit arising from this road is derived from the transportation of persons. The work was began on the line in 1831, and completed June, 1833, aggregate cost $450,000. Before the construction of this road Norfolk had always been regarded as the proper depot and outlet for the trade of the Roanoke valley, and would no doubt have become possessed of it by improvements connected with her Dismal Swamp Canal; but this road having arrested most of the trade and carried it to Petersburg, the country about Norfolk procured at the session of 1833-4 the passage of an act authorizing the Portsmouth and Roanoke Railroad, which is to terminate at the same point on the Roanoke with the Petersburg road, and which is now under contract. The construction of the Portsmouth road will probably carry the trade to the seaboard, to avoid the tedious navigation of the James river, after it reaches Petersburg,—unless there should be a road made from Richmond to Petersburg, (which is spoken of) by which the trade coming by this route would have the advantage of the market of both cities. We can scarcely believe that there will be trade enough to employ profitably, both roads, as some suppose, but the travelling alone will always enable the Petersburg road to pay something to its owners. The Winchester Railroad, connecting the flourishing town of Winchester, with the Baltimore and Ohio railroad at Harper's Ferry, is rapidly progressing, and nearly completed. The Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad company have the law, and will probably soon have the funds necessary for its completion, as the trade would be considerable, and the travelling immense. The following list exhibits a number of projected improvements, for which the state has granted charters, and authorised a subscription of two fifths, on the part of the literary fund, as soon as the individual subscription should make up the other three-fifths, some of these improvements are now going on actively, but in the most of them the stock has not as yet we believe been taken: Name of Companies Date of Act Capital Two-fifths.

Few countries possess greater advantages than Virginia, for success in manufacturing; she has labour sufficiently cheap and abundant, inexhaustible supplies of fuel, and almost unlimited water-power. But planting and farming continue the favourite pursuits; her citizens seeming unwilling to invest their capital in enterprizes new and hazardous, and for which they have not been rendered competent by their habits and education. There are however extremely valuable flour mills, and some nail, cotton and other manufactories at Richmond, of which a more detailed account will be given when we speak of that city. In speaking of Wheeling in the N. W. part of the state, we shall give an account of her manufactories of cotton and woollen cloths, glass, iron, nails, porter, &amp;c. which are numerous and valuable. The salt works on the Kanawha produce annually about 12,00,000 bushels of salt, and the amount is only limited by the demand; those on Holston produce from 150,000 to 200,000; and there are others on a smaller scale which will be noticed in their proper places. AGRICULTURE. There is great diversity in the agriculture of the state, but it is for the most part badly conducted. The old practice of cultivating land every year until exhausted, and then leaving it to recover from its own resources, still continues in many places. In others the three shift system prevails;— that is first a crop of Indian corn, sceond, wheat, rye or oats, and third—the year of rest as it is erroneously called, but in which in fact the stock are permitted to glean a scanty subsistence from the spontaneous vegetation;— after which it is again subjected to the scourging process of cultivation, while little attention is paid to the application of manures or the artificial grasses. This destructive system for the most part prevails from the sea board to the head of tide-water, and on the south side of James River to the Blue Ridge. On the north side of that river, especially towards the Potomac, cultivation is much better; a regular system of rotation in crops is attended to; grass seeds, generally red clover, (trifolium pratense) are sown on the small grain; animal and vegetable manures are saved with care and judiciously applied, gypsum is used to great extent and with very powerful effect. In the valley district, also a good system of cultivation is pursued; and irrigated meadows are common, and very productive. On both sides of the Blue Ridge, maize or Indian corn, wheat, rye, oats, and buck wheat are the principal grain crops. Tobacco is the principal staple of most of eastern Virginia, but in the Valley is cultivated only in its southern portion,—and not at all beyond the Alleghany. The grasses common to both regions are the red clover (trifolium pratense,) orchard grass (dactylis glomerata) timothy (phleum pratensa,) and herds grass, (alopecurus pratensis,) the two former are cultivated on dry, the latter on moist soils. In the eastern and southern counties, cotton is planted to considerable extent. On the shores of the Chesapeake barley and the castor oil bean (ricinus communis) are cultivated; and on some of the best lands above tide-water hemp is raised to advantage. The Trans-Alleghany country, being exceedingly mountainous, and remote from market is chiefly devoted to raising live-stock. No more grain is raised than is sufficient to supply the country itself, and the travellers and stock-drovers who pass through it; but in summer the visitors of the mineral waters, afford a very considerable market, consuming an immense quantity of provisions. The climate and soil are very favourable to grass, and afford excellent pastures. The greensward and white clover, (trifolium ripens) spring up spontaneously wherever the timber is removed or deadened, and on rich ground are very luxuriant. The cattle are fattened generally on fine pastures of clover and timothy mixed. It is difficult to speak with precision of the profits of agriculture in Virginia, in many instances it yields a bare subsistence to the cultivator, in others a neat income of two or three per cent; but where the lands are in good heart, careful and judicious husbandry practised, and wheat and tobacco the principal crops, there is no doubt that with slave labour a profit of from 6 to 8 per cent may be annually realized from capital invested; to accomplish this however, great attention and activity are necessary on the part of the proprietor. Lands in the Valley, in consequence of there being fewer slaves, are more equally divided among the whites; the young population settle more at home, instead of moving to the west—and the lands are generally better cultivated: these circumstances cause land to sell generally higher in that section, and the country to be more prosperous, although running streams are less frequent and communication with market more difficult and expensive. In 1831 according to official returns 4459 hogshead of tobacco were delivered from the several warehouses in the state for exportation or manufacture, and during the year ending in June 1832, upwards of 544,000 barrels of flour passed the various inspections. The quantity of flour inspected however constitutes but a very uncertain index of the amount produced. Virginia flour, especially the Richmond brands, stand very high in foreign markets, and in South America particularly, bear a price far above all other flour. Most of the vegetable productions found in the southern and middle states are common also to Virginia. West of the Alleghany the sugar maple grows in abundance. There are some excellent native grapes, the culture of which it is presumed will claim greater attention, since the winters have been found too severe for the foreign vine. The subject of judicious and scientific agriculture is receiving more attention every day. The good work is promoted by agricultural societies, and Mr. Edmund Ruffin's valuable production, the Farmer's Register, decidedly the best work upon the subject, published in America. COMMERCE. The value of imports into the state of Virginia, between October 1st 1830, and September 30th 1831, was $488,522, and the domestic produce exported amounted to $4,149,986,—foreign produce exported $489,—total exports $4,150,475. This immense difference between the imports and exports is made up by imports from sister states, the precise amount of which it is impossible to ascertain, but there is always a balance against us to the credit of our northern friends. At the same time the amount of tonnage employed was as follows:— American entered, 2,2933, foreign entered, 9,983—total entered, 32,916. American departed, 48,719, foreign departed, 11,879—total departed, 60,598. FISCAL CONCERNS.

REMARKS. Arrangement pursued in the description of counties. We have now completed our "General Description of Virginia;" having presented in the first part a view of Natural Virginia, comprehending her Situation, Boundaries, Extent, Face of the Country, Mineralogy and Geology, Scenery and Natural Curiosities, Mountains, Bays, Harbours, Rivers, &amp;c. and in the second, her Moral and Political Condition:—under which head we included, Population, Religion, Government and Laws, Arms and Military Organization, Provisions for the Insane, Penitentiary, Internal Improvement, Manufactures, Agriculture, Commerce, and Fiscal Concerns. We now proceed to give a more detailed account of the same subjects, taking the State, County, by County, in alphabetical order, and giving the origin of the county, an accurate and generally minute account of its topography, and a detail of the number, occupation, &amp;c. of its Citizens, and of each Town and Village. In order to present a more condensed and connected view, than would have been possible by taking the counties of the whole State at once into consideration, in the confused order which an alphabetical arrangement would present; and as that arrangement was absolutely necessary for covenience of reference, we have divided the State into Eastern and Western Virginia, at the Blue Ridge, and made an alphabetical arrangement of the counties of each portion separately. The Towns, Villages, Post Offices, &amp;c. are arranged in Alphabetical order in the counties to which they respectively belong; the County Town, and other places of more than usual importance, being distinguished by a larger type. An Alphabetical Index of all the places mentioned, and general subjects treated of is at the end of the volume. Under the head of Eastern Virginia, we will consider all of the counties east of the Blue Ridge. EASTERN VIRGINIA. ACCOMAC.

The parallel of N. lat. 38° passes very nearly through the centre of the county, which is likewise the case with long. 1° 30′ W. of Washington. The northern part of this county is drained by the Rivanna and its constituent creeks, which uniting below. Charlottesville, pass through the South West Mountain, and enter Fluvanna some miles below. The southern portion of the county is drained by the waters of the Hardware, which rises by 2 branches, the one in North Garden, and the other in South Garden, which uniting at the foot of the S. W. Mountain flow between the portions of it known by the local name of Carter's and Green-Mountain, and passes also into Fluvanna, before its junction with James River. There is little of the soil of Albemarle absolutely barren, and in the mountain valleys, and river or creek bottoms it is exceedingly fertile, whilst the undulating hills which intervene are susceptible of almost unlimited improvement by judicious cultivation. The scenery in all parts of the county is exceedingly beautiful and picturesque; we know of no portion of the state which presents such a number and variety of beautiful prospects as 15 may be seen from the hills of Albemarle. This county belongs to the twelfth judicial circuit and sixth district. Population in 1820, 19,750— in 1830, 22,618.

C. Several lines of daily stages pass through this town.

The surface on which the town stands is elevated from 5 to 700 feet above the tide of the ocean, and the vicinity is salubrious, and the soil fertile, producing in abundance, wheat, corn, oats, tobacco, &amp;c. In the neighbourhood are several extensive flour manufacturing, grist, and saw mills, and 2 carding machines.

V. 94 m's. N. W. by W. of R. and 136 S. W. of W. it has several dwelling houses. Population 30. One physician. Milton, 120 ms. S. W. of W. and 81 N. W. by W. of R. and 6 miles S. E. of Charlottesville;—situated on the right bank of the Rivanna, and a mile and a half from the main stage road leading from Charlottesville to Richmond. It was formerly a place of some trade, being the head of boat navigation, but the imperfect state of the navigation and the competition of Scottsville and Charlottesville have caused it to go to ruin. It contains 16 dwelling houses, 2 mercantile stores, and 1 tanyard,—It has a pleasant and romantic situation, upon a high spur or abutment of Monticello mountain, which places it far above the level of the river.—On the opposite side of the river, there is a Baptist church and a grist mill. Population 60 whites and 10 free blacks. Moreman's River, P. O. 143 ms. from W. and 104 from R.—N. W. of Charlottesville, and in the N. W. angle of the county, it has a house of private entertainment, one general store and a blacksmith shop. Monticello.—We have seen no where so true, so accurate, or so beautiful a description of the dwelling place of the Great Apostle of Liberty, as in Wirt's "Eulogy upon Adams and Jefferson". We are glad to have an opportunity of relieving the tedium of dry statistic detail, by so rich a specimen of taste. "Let us now turn for a moment to the patriot of the South. The Roman morallist, in that great work which he has left for the government of man in all the offices of life, has descended even to prescribe the kind of habitation in which an honored and distinguished man should dwell. It should not, he says, be small, and mean, and sordid: nor, on the other hand, extended with profuse and wanton extravagance. It should be large enough to receive and accommodate the visiters which such a man never fails to attract, and suited in its ornaments, as well as in its dimensions, to the character and fortune of the individual. Monticello has now lost its great charm. "Those of you who have not already visited it, will not be very apt to visit it hereafter, and from the feelings which you cherish for its departed owner, I persuade myself that you will not be displeased with a brief and rapid sketch of that abode of domestic bliss, that temple of science. Nor is it, indeed, foreign to the express purpose of this meeting, which, in looking to `his life and character,' naturally embraces his home and his domestic habits. Can any thing be indifferent to us, which was so dear to him, and which was a subject of such just admiration to the hundreds and thousands that were continually resorting to it, as an object of pious pilgrimage? "The Mansion House at Monticello was built and furnished in the days of his prosperity. In its dimensions, its architecture, its arrangements and ornaments, it is such a one as became the character and fortune of the man. It stands upon an elliptic plain, formed by cutting down the apex of a mountain; and, to the west, stretching away to the north and the south, it commands a view of the Blue Ridge for a hundred and fifty miles, and brings under the eye one of the boldest and most beautiful horizons in the world; while on the east, it presents an extent of prospect bounded only by the spherical form of the earth, in which nature seems to sleep in eternal repose, as if to form one of her finest contrasts with the rude and rolling grandeur of the west. In the wide prospect, and scattered to the north and south, are several detached mountains, which contribute to animate and diversify this enchanting landscape; and among them, to the south Willis's mountain,* * This mountain, which is in the county of Buckingham, at a distance of 70 miles from R. consists of two conical peaks jutting from the plain, which often at sunrise on a clear morning, assume every possible variety of form, and in each appears so natural, that one seeing it for the first time, would suppose each its natural shape. This beautiful illusion is produced by the rising of the clouds towards the summit of the mountain, on the rising of the sun. which is so interestingly depicted in his Notes From this summit, the Philosopher was wont to enjoy that spectacle, among the sublimest of Nature's operations, the looming of the distant mountains; and to watch the motions of the planets, and the greater revolution of the celestial sphere. From this summit, too, the patriot could look down with uninterrupted vision, upon the wide expanse of the world around, for which he considered himself born; and upward to the open and vaulted heavens, which he seemed to approach, as if to keep him continually in mind of his high responsibility. It is indeed a prospect in which you see and feel, at once, that nothing mean or little could live. It is a scene fit to nourish those great and high-souled principles which formed the elements of his character, and was a most noble and appropriate post for such a sentinel, over the rights and liberties of men. "Approaching the house on the east, the visiter instinctively paused to cast around one thrilling glance at this magnificent panorama: and then passed to the vestibule, where, if he had not been previously informed, he would immediately perceive that he was entering the house of no common man. In the spacious and lofty hall which opens before him, he marks no tawdry and unmeaning ornaments but before, on the right, on the left, all around, the eye is struck and gratified by objects of science and taste, so classed and arranged as to produce their finest effect. On one side, specimens of sculpture set out in such order, as to exhibit at a coup d' Oil, the historical progress of that art, from the first rude attempts of the aborigines of our country, up to that exquisite and finished bust of the great patriot himself, from the master hand of Caracci. On the other side the visiter sees displayed a vast collection of specimens of the Indian art, their paintings, weapons, ornaments, and manufactures; on another an array of the fossil productions of our country, mineral and animal; the polished remains of those colossal monsters that once trod our forests, and are no more; and a variegated display of the branching honors of those `monarchs of the waste,' that still people the wilds of the American Continent. "From this hall he was ushered into a noble saloon, from which the glorious landscape of the west again bursts upon his view; and which, within, is hung thick around with the finest productions of the pencil—historical paintings of the most striking subjects, from all countries, and all ages; the portraits of distinguished men and patriots, both of Europe and America, and medallions, and engravings in endless profusion. "While the visiter was yet lost in the contemplation of these treasures of the arts and sciences, he was startled by the approach of a strong and sprightly step, and turning with instinctive reverence to the door of entrance, he was met by the tall, and animated, and stately figure of the patriot himself—his countenance beaming with intelligence and benignity, and his outstretched hand, with its strong and cordial pressure, confirming the courteous welcome of his lips. And then came the charm of manner and conversation that passes all description—so cheerful—so unassuming—so free, and easy, and frank, and kind, and gay,—that even the young and overawed, and embarrassed visiter forgets his fears, and felt himself by the side of an old and familiar friend." Mr. Jefferson states in his Notes that Monticello is 500 feet above the Rivanna which runs at its base; it is the most northern of the portion of the South West mountain, called by the local name of Carter's mountain. The late proprietor injured the appearance of Monticello very much by cutting down the beautiful shade and ornamental trees for the purpose of cultivation; but it is believed that the deep veneration entertained by the present owner for the character of Mr. Jefferson, and the respect he entertains even for the inanimate objects associated with his memory, will lead him to restore it, as far as possible to the condition in which he left it, and attend carefully to the preservation of every object which could be supposed to have occupied his attention, or added beauty to his residence. The curiosities of which Mr, Wirt speaks were presented to the University of Virginia, the paintings we believe were sold, the bust was bought by Congress —A simple massive granite obelisk marks the grave of Jefferson, with the unostentatious inscription written by himself, which speaks only of being the "Author of the Declaration of Independence, and the Founder of the University of Virginia," thus showing how much more highly the venerable sage regarded the bursting of the fetters which bound the freedom of the people, and the emancipation of the mind from the chains of ignorance,—than all his civic triumphs. Mount Alto, P. O. 156 ms. S. W. by W. of W. and 97 ms from R. Mount Israel P. O. 145 ms. S. W. of W. and 103 from R.—17 ms. N. W. of Charlottesville. New York, P. V. 143 ms. S. S. W. of W. and 101 from R.—It is situated in the western part of the county, near the foot of the Blue Ridge, it contains 15 houses, 2 general stores, 1 tanyard, 1 jackscrew manufacturer, 1 boot and shoe maker, and 1 blacksmith's shop—Population 70. Scottsville, formerly Scott's Ferry, is 150 miles S. W. of Washington, and 83 W. of Richmond. It is situated on the N. bank of James river, 20 miles W. S. W. of Charlottesville. This place has improved rapidly in the last 4 years, and is yet a flourishing village. It contains 120 houses, chiefly of brick; one Methodist and one Presbyterian house of worship, a male and a female school, and two Sunday schools, nine general and five grocery stores, and one apothecaries shop. The principal manufactures are clothing, leather shoes, cabinet work, and earthen ware. An inspection of flour and tobacco is established in this place, of the former the average quantity inspected and sold is 3500 barrels. Scottsville carries on an extensive trade in flour, bacon, butter, lard, and other products, with the counties of Nelson, Augusta, Rockbridge, Rockingham, Bath, Pendleton, and Pocahontas; these products are exchanged for groceries, gypsum, coarse cotton and woollen cloths and money. The market of Scottsville is ready and tempting to the producer, the only fault of its enterprising merchants being that they pay prices too liberal for their own prosperity, and this cause only has lately given a temporary check to the rising of the town. A tri-weekly line of stages passes through it, communicating with Richmond and Staunton. Scottsville being situated at the extreme northwestern bend of the navigable water of James river, would probably acquire an immense increase of trade, if the James and Kanawha improvement is carried into effect. There is a savings institution in the town. It has two resident attornies and four regular physicians; its whole population is about 600. Shadwell Mills,—erected by Mr. Jefferson, on the Rivanna near the spot of his birth; they carry on an extensive business, having a large merchant, grist, and saw mill, with a carding machine, &amp;c. The main stage road from Charlottesville to Richmond runs by them. Stoney Point, P. V. 71 ms. N. W. by W. of Richmond, and 113 from Washington—in the N. E. part of the county. University of Virginia, P. O. situated one mile W. of Charlottesville, 124 W. of S. W. from Washington, and 82 N. W. by W. of Richmond. This institution was founded in 1819, under the immediate supervision of Mr. Jefferson, and organised in 1825, and had the same year 123 students, and has been gradually increasing until in 1834 it had 208,— Its Library contains nearly 10,000 volumes; its philosophical and chemical apparatus are very complete, and it has a handsome cabinet of minerals. There is also an anatomical and a general museum, and an astronomical observatory, with the requisite instruments. The importance of this institution to the state renders it necessary to give a fuller detail of its management and regulations than of similar institutions. Matriculation—To be admitted into the University, the Student must be sixteen years of age; but the Faculty are authorised to dispense with this requisition in the case of application for admission by two brothers, one of whom is under the age of sixteen. If the applicant for admission has been a student at any other incorporated seminary, he cannot be received, but on producing a certificate from such seminary, or other satisfactory evidence to the Faculty, with respect to his general good conduct. Every Student is free to attend the Schools of his choice, and no other than he choses; provided, that if under the age of twenty-one, he shall attend at least three professors, unless he has the written authority of his parent or guardian, or the Faculty shall, for good cause shewn, allow him to attend less than three. The qualifications of the Student to enter the Schools of Antient Languages, Mathematics, and Natural Philosophy, are tested by previous examinations. Before a student matriculates, he is furnished with a copy of the laws, which he is required to read. On matriculating, he signs a written declaration, that he will conform to those laws, and, if he be a resident student, that he has deposited with the Patron all the funds in his possession. Course of Instruction—In each school, there are three regular lectures a week; besides which, there are in most of them extra lectures suited to the several classes into which the school is divided. The mode of instruction is by text-books and lectures, accompanied by rigid examinations. The course pursued in each school, is as follows. Ancient Languages. Professor Harrison.—In this school are taught the Latin and Greek Languages, and Literature, and the Hebrew Language. The instruction, given by prelections and examinations, comprises the following subjects. 1. The formation and composition of words, and the laws by which they are governed. 2. The primary and secondary signification of words and the principles by which they must be ascertained. 3. Syntax—The relations which words sustain to each other in a sentence, are taught at the same time and in connexion with their endings, the latter serving, with the aid of prepositions, &amp;c., as signs of the former The importance of attending to the order in which words are arranged in a sentence, and of being careful to read the words and members of a sentence just as they stand in the Latin and Greek authors, is insisted upon. The other idomatic peculiarities are carefully noticed. 4. Metres and Quantity.—These are objects of constant attention. 5. The Greek and Roman History, Geography and Literature, are taught by prelections, and by commenting on portions of the text-books appointed to be read. These form part of the studies of the senior classes. The text-books are: In the Junior Latin Class:—Horace, Cicero's Epistles ad Diversos, Terence, and Cæsar's Commentaries, the last chiefly with a view to the written exercises. Zumpt's Latin Grammar is referred to The student should have Lempriere's Classical Dictionary, new edition by Anthon, in two vols.; Adams' Roman Antiquities, and the Ancient, with the corresponding Modern Maps of the series published by the "Society for the diffusion of useful knowledge," or the "Æton Comparative Atlas." In the Senior Latin Class:—Juvenal, Livy, and Tacitus. Of both Livy and Tacitus the student should have the whole works, so far as they remain. In the Junior Greek Class:—Xenophon's Anabasis, a play of Euripides, or Æschylus, and Herodotus Buttmann's Greek Grammar, is rererred to —the "Larger" Grammar of Buttmann, by Robinson, is to be preferred. Donnegan's Greek and English Lexicon, and Thiersch's Greek Tables by Patton, are recommended. In the Senior Greek Class:—Euripides, Sophocles, Thucydides, and Homer. In the prelections to this class, it is attempted to introduce the student into the higher departments of grammatical criticism; references are made to the large Grammar of Matthiæ, and to the annotations of Porson, Schaefer, Hermann, Erfurdt, Elmsley, &amp;c. In Roman History, &amp;c.—The students are advised to read the early part of Hooke's Roman History, with Ferguson's Roman Republic, Niebuhr's Roman History, and Heeren's Manual: also, Montesquieu's "Grandeur et decadence des Romains," and Dunlop's History of Roman Literature. In Grecian History, &amp;c.:—The History of Greece published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, is the text-book. Reference is made to Mitford, Gillies, &amp;c. In both Grecian and Roman History, pains is taken to point out the ancient authorities. In Hebrew:—Biblia Hebraica, edit. Van Der Hooght, by D'Allemand, London; or the revised edition by Aug Hahn, Leipsic; which is better. Stuart's Hebrew Grammar, 3d edition, and Gesenius's Hebrew Lexicon, by Gibbs: [not the abridgement.] It is expected of the students of Latin and Greek, that they will read in their rooms a list of such authors and parts of authors, furnished by the Professor, as cannot be read in the lecture-room e. g. Cicero's Epistles to Atticus, his Orations (selected,) and Treatise "de Republica;" Sallust, Terence, Plautus. Æschylus, Virgil, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Demosthenes, Æschines, Thucydides, &amp;c. As an essential part of the course, the students of each class are required to furnish regularly, once a week, a written exercise; which consists in the conversion of Latin or Greek into English, and of English into Latin or Greek. The exercises are examined by the Professor, and the errors marked: thus corrected, they are returned to the students, and the corrections stated and explained in the presence of the class. For these exercises, the classic authors are used as the text. The black-board is continually used for the prupose of assisting the student, by the aid of the eye, in comprehending and retaining the illustrations given. Modern Languages. Professor Blættermann.—The languages taught, in this school, are the French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Anglo Saxon; and if desired, will also be taught, the Danish, Swedish, Hollandish, and Portuguese Languages. In each of them, there are two classes, the senior and the junior, together with a third class for those who wish to qualify themselves for degrees in this school, as it is required that two degrees be obtained in modern languages before that of A. M. will be conferred. Besides the oral translations in the lecture room, the students are required to write, as regular exercises out of the lecture rooms, translations from the foreign language into English, and vice versa. Lectures on the Literature of each of the nations whose languages are taught, are delivered twice a week, by the Professor; as also lectures on Modern History, and the political relations of the different civilized nations of the present day. The text-books used are the principal classics in each language. Mathematics. Professor Bonnycastle.—In this school there are commonly 5 classes. Of these, the first junior begins with Arithmetic; but as the student is required to have some knowledge of this subject when he enters the University, the lectures of the Professor are limited to the theory, shewing the methed of naming numbers, the different scales of notation, and the derivation of the several rules of Arithmetic from the primary notion of addition; the addition namely, of sensible objects one by one. The ideas thus acquired are appealed to at every subsequent step, and much pains are taken to exhibit the gradual developement from these elementary truths, of the extensive science of mathematical analysis. Lacroix's Arithmetic is the text-book. In Algebra, the first problems are analyzed with, and without, the use of letters, to make the student sensible of the advantages of these signs. In teaching the rules for adding, subtracting, &amp;c., they are compared with the correspondent rules in Arithmetic, and the agreement or diversity is noticed and explained. The text-book is Lacroix's Algebra. In Geometry, the first elements are taught, and illustrated by the use of models. The second junior class continue to read Lacroix's Algebra, and Bonnycastle's Inductive Geometry. Is the latter, they successively acquire, the theorems of Synthetic Geometry— the theory and practice of Plane and Spherical Trigonometry, with the application of the latter to Nautical Astronomy—the theory of Projection— and the theory of Curved lines and Surfaces. Their subsequent studies usually embrace a portion of the Differential Calculus. The senior classes continue the Differential Calculus in lessons taken from Young and from Bonnycastle's Geometry, concluding the course of pure Mathematics with the Integral Calculus, the theory of which is taken from Young, and the examples, from Peacock. There is, moreover, a class of Mixed Mathematics, for such of the more advanced students as choose to pursue it; which consists of parts of Venturoli's Mechanics, the first book of Laplace's Mecanique Celeste, and of the applications of the principles there given to various problems. And, lastly, there is attached to this school a class of Civil Engineering; wherein are taught the first principles of Descriptive Geometry—of the construction of draughts and plans—of surveying—and, lastly, of the construction of Roads, Canals, Bridges, and other public works. Natural Philosophy. Professor Patterson.—The course of lectures in this school is divided into two parts, each of which is followed by a general written examination of the students. The first part treats of the properties of ponderable bodies, and includes Statics, Dynamics, Hydrostatics, Hydrodynamics, Pneumatics, Crystalization, Molecular and Capillary Attraction, Strength and Stress of Materials, and Acoustics. The second part comprises Heat, including Meteorology and the Steamengine, Electricity and Galvanism, 16 Magnetism and Electro Magnetism, Optics, Astronomy. The text-books used are, Lardner and Kater's Mechanics, Lardner's Hydrostatics and Pneumatics, Brewster's Optics, the Treatises on Heat, Electricity, Galvanism, Magnetism, and Electro Magnetism, in the Library of Useful Knowledge, and Herschel's Astronomy. As the enactments require only an acquaintance with arithmetic in order to enter this school, mathematical demonstrations, though not avoided by the Professor, are not required of the students of the general class. But the candidates for graduation form a separate class, and are taught the applications of elementary mathematics, (Algebra, Geometry, and Trigonometry,) to Natural Philosophy. The application of the higher calculus belongs to the school of Mathematics. The Apparatus provided for the school of Natural Philosophy is very extensive and complete, and thus enables the Professor to illustrate every part of his course by experiments in the presence of his class. An Observatory, with its appropriate astronomical instruments, is also attached to this school. Chemistry and Materia Medica. Professor Emmet.—There are two classes in this school; one of Chemistry, to which there are lectures given twice a week, and the other of Materia Medica and Pharmacy, to which is given a lecture once a week throughout the session. In the Chemical lectures, all the important applications of the science to the mechanic arts, agriculture and domestic economy are noticed, and, when practicable, illustrated by experiment. In the lectures on earths and metals, the appropriate minerals are exhibited and noticed with reference to the sciences of Mineralogy and Geology. At the close of the history of inorganic matter, the atomic theory and the laws of definite proportions are fully explained and exemplified. The latter part of the course is occupied with the chemistry of organic substances, and it comprises the history, analysis and properties of each substance; to which are added general views of the connexion between Chemistry and the physiology of animals and vegetables. In the lectures on Materia Medica and Pharmacy, the subjects are treated in the following order:—The operations of Pharmacy, Pharmaceutical preparations, the effect which the combining of different substances has on their medicinal properties, the different classifications of the Materia Medica, and lastly, its several articles treated alphabetically. There is attached to this school, a very extensive apparatus and a laboratory, in which the students are occasionally permitted to see the operations, and to perform experiments. A free use is made of the black-board in these as in almost all the other classes in the University. Medicine. Professor Magill.— The subjects taught in this school are Physiology, Pathology, Therapeutics, Obstetrics and Medical Jurisprudence. The last forms a distinct class, and comprehends other students in addition to those of Medicine. A full course of lectures is delivered on each of the above branches. Dunglison's Human Physiology is the text-book on that subject; in Pathology and the practice of Medicine, Eberle's Practice of Medicine is recommended; in Obstetrics, Burns, or Dewees, or Gooch; and in Medical Jurisprudence, Beck or Ryan. Anatomy and Surgery. Professor Warner.—In Anatomy, the lectures are delivered from Subjects, with which the school is regularly supplied. The text-book is Horner's Special Anatomy. In Surgery, the text-book is Cooper's First Lines. This and the two preceding schools constitute the Medical Department of the University; and the candidates for the degree of "Doctor of Medicine," must pass examination in them all. An extensive Museum is attached to this department. It possesses one advantage, at least, over the other Medical Schools in the United States in having a session of more than ten months, instead of one of about four. A full course of lectures in the Medical Department of this University, is considered as equivalent to a full course in both the Philadelphia and Baltimore Schools; so that a student with a certificate from this University of having attended a full course of lectures here, is entitled to stand for graduation at either of the above named schools, after having attended all the lectures there delivered for one session only. Moral Philosophy. Professor Tucker.—There are two classes in this school. The Junior Class studies Rhetoric, Belles-Lettres and Logic, the first half of the session, and Belles-Lettres and Ethics, the last half. The Senior, studies Mental Philosophy, the first part of the session, and Political Economy the last. The examinations are on the Professor's lectures, Brown's Philosophy, Say's Political Economy, and Adam Smith. In the Junior Class, the examinations are on the Professor's Lectures, Blair's Lectures, Campbell's Rhetoric, Stewart's Active and Moral Powers. There are also in this school, lectures on logic and general grammar. Law. Professor Davis.—In this school are taught the Law of Nature and Nations, the Science of Government, Constitutional Law, the Common and Statute Law, Equity, and Maritime and Commercial Law. This school is divided into two classes. The text-books studied by the junior class, are Vattel's Law of Nature and of Nations, the Federalist, the Virginia Report of '99, and Blackstone's Commentaries. Those studied by the senior, are Coke upon Littleton, (Thomas's edition,) Stephen on Pleading, Starkie on Evidence, (the first vol.) Toller on Executors, Chitty on Contracts, Bayley on Bills, Fonblanque's Equity, and Mitford's Pleadings; to which it is proposed to add a treatise on Commercial and Maritime Law. On these books, prelections are delivered by the Professor, in which it is his object to supply what is deficient and explain what is obscure in the text, to refer in connection with it to the leading cases and authorities, American and English, illustrative of the topic under consideration, and generally, to offer such comments as he deems necessary to its thorough understanding. In these prelections, the statute law of Virginia and the United States, and its effects on the pre-existing law are particularly explained. Each prelection is preceded by an examination on the last together with its text. On government, and on various topics of National, Constitutional and Municipal Law, not discussed in the text-books, lectures are delivered; on which also, the class are examined. Students not wishing to study Municipal Law, can enter for that portion only of the junior course, which embraces National Law, Government and Constitutional Law; which portion, those wishing to study Municipal Law only, can if they choose omit. The students of this school have instituted a Law Society, at the meetings of which the Professor presides. In it, questions connected with the studies of the school are discussed, fictitious cases litigated in the form of regular pleadings, and the issues produced decided in the appropriate mode, and the members exercised in conveyancing by having to prepare and submit to the Society the necessary deeds to effectuate supposed agreements, &amp;c. Religious exercises are performed at the University every Sunday, by a Minister of the Gospel, residing there, whose services are rendered on the private invation of the Professors, Ofcers and Students. Examinations.—There are two public examinations of all the students, each session, the one at such convenient time about the middle of the session as the Faculty shall appoint, the other at the close of the session. These are thus conducted. The Professor of the School prepares, in writing, a series of questions to be proposed to his class, and affixes to them numerical values, according to his estimate of their relative difficulty. On the assembling of the class for examination, these question are for the first time presented to them; and they are required to answer them in writing, in a prescribed time, without communication with one another or with other persons, and without any reference to books. Their answers are subsequently carefully examined and compared, and a value attached to each, not exceeding that of the corresponding question. In the schools of languages, subjects may also be selected for oral examination, and the values of these exercises are marked at the time. The students are then arranged into four divisions, according to the merit of their examinations, as determined by the following method. The numerical values attached to all the questions are added together, and also the values of the answers given by each student. If this last number amounts to three-fourths of the first, the student is ranked in the first division; if it be less than three-fourths and as much as one-half, in the second; if less than one-half and as much as a fourth, in the third; if less than a fourth, in the fourth division. The examinations are conducted and the results acertained by a committee, consisting of the professor of the school and two other professors. The standing of each student at the examinations is communicated to his parent or guardian: and the names of those who are in the first divisions are announced on the public day, at the close of the session, and published in one or more of the newspapers of the state. Degrees—Three honarary distinctions are conferred in this Institution; a Certificate of Proficiency— that of Graduate in any School—and that of Master of Arts of the University of Virginia. The first, the Faculty may confer on any student who shall, on examination, give satisfactory evidence of a competent acquaintance with any of those particular branches which, according to the regulations, may be separately attended in a school. The second, they are authorized to confer on any student who shall, on examination, give satisfactory evidence of his proficiency in the general studies of any of the schools. And the third, is obtained by graduation, in the schools if Antient Languages, Modern Languages, Mathemetics, Natural Philosophy, Chemistry, and Moral Philosophy. But in all cases, to obtain a diploma, or certificate of proficiency, the candidate must give the Faculty satisfactory proof of his ability to write the English language correctly. No particular period of study is prescribed for the acquisition of these honors. The student obtains them whenever he can undergo the rigid examinations to which the candidates for them are subjected. The title of Doctor of Medicine is conferred on the graduate in the Medical Department. On the last day of the session, the Visitors, Faculty, Officers and Students, assemble in the Rotunda, and the public are invited to attend. On this occasion, the certificates and diplomas are awarded to the successful candidates, the results of the examinations are announced, and orations are delivered, and essays read by Students appointed for that purpose. Expenses, &amp;c.—The expenses for the session of upwards of 10 months, commencing the 1st of September, and ending the 4th of July following, are as follows:— Board, including bed and other room furniture, washing and attendance, $100 Fuel and candles, to be furnished by the Proctor, at cost, and 5 per cent commission, estimated, if only one student in the dormitory, at $30,—if two students in the dormitory at 15 Rent of an entire dormitory $16; for half, if occupied by two students, 8 Use of the library and public rooms, 15 Fees—if one professor be attended $50; if two, each $30: if more than two, each $25—say, 75 Total, exclusive of books and stationary, clothing and pocket money, $213 In addition to the regular fee, $20 is paid by students who attend the Senior Class in the school of Law. Boarding-houses are provided within the precincts, for the accommodation of students; and no student is permitted to board or lodge out of the precincts, unless in the family of his parent or guardian, or of some particular friend, approved by the Faculty. Except, that students above the age of 20 years, may reside out of the precincts, in such private boarding-houses as the Faculty may approve. Every student resident within the precincts, is required, on matriculating, to deposit with the Patron, all the money, checks, bills, drafts, and other available funds, which he shall have in his possession, or under his control, in any manner intended to defray his expenses while at the University, or on his return from thence to his residence. Nor shall he matriculate, till he shall have deposited a sum at least sufficient, after deducting the Patron's commission, two per cent. to pay for the use of his dormitory and the public rooms, to pay the fees of the Professors whom he may design to attend, to pay 3 months' board to his hotel-keeper, to purchase the text-books and stationary which he may want at the commencement, and $20 on account of fuel and candles, and $10 to cover contingent charges and assessments against him for injuries to the buildings, &amp;c., which two last mentioned sums are credited in the final settlement of his accounts. In like manner, he shall deposit with the Patron all the funds which he shall receive while a student of the University, for the purposes aforesaid. At the end of the first three months of the session, he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the next three months; and at the expiration of the second period of three months, he shall deposit enough to pay his board and other expenses for the residue of the session. Students resident out of the University, are required, on matriculating, to deposit with the Patron funds sufficient, after deducting the Patron's commission, to pay the fees of the Professors whom they propose to attend, the sum charged for the use of the public rooms, and $10 to cover contingent charges. The expenses of the students resident in the University, are limited as follows:—for board, the use of dormitory and public rooms, and tuition fees, the sums before stated; for clothing during the session, a sum not exceeding $100; for pocket-money during the session, not exceeding $40; for books or stationery, whatever the parent or guardian may think fit to allow; for medicine and medical attendance whatever may be necessary. These limits are in no case to be exceeded, unless under special circumstances, the Faculty shall allow it. Resident students are forbidden to contract any debts whatsoever; but for every thing purchased, they are forthwith to pay, or to draw upon a fund in the hands of the Patron applicable thereto. Students, wherever resident, are required to wear the uniform prescribed by the enactments; consisting of cloth of a dark grey mixture, at a price not exceeding $6 a yard. The Faculty, at their discretion, may allow any man, of undoubted moral character, above the age of 23 years, to attend lectures in any of the Schools of the University, and to reside out of the precincts, exempt from the rules and regulations prescribed for the government of students: except only, that he shall pay the usual Professors' fees, and the usual compensation for the use of the public rooms, and shall observe all those laws of the Institution which enjoin respectful and orderly deportment. But the privilege so allowed may be withdrawn by the Faculty, at any time, when in their opinion it has been used to the evil example of the students, and otherwise to the injury of the Institution. At the end of every month, a circular is addressed by the Chairman of the Faculty to the parent or guardian of each student, in which are stated his absences from the lectures he was bound to attend, and other irregularities of which he may have been guilty, that month; together with such information as to the student's progress and conduct as it may be deemed proper to communicate. Accomplishments.—There are in the University, teachers of Music, Fencing and Dancing, authorized by the Faculty to give instruction in those accomplishments to such students, as wish to acquire them. A military corps has been formed by the students, and an instructor appointed, for the purpose of learning military tactics. One afternoon in the week is devoted to these exercises; but it is at the option of the student whether he will engage in them.

This village is beautifully situated, and the fertility of the surrounding soil, and grandeur of the landscape are objects of universal admiration; the salubrity of this neighborhood is unsurpassed in the U. States—It contains several dwelling houses—one free church— one common school—two mercantile stores—two taverns—and one cooper's-shop—Population 50; of whom two are physicians. Yancey's Mills, P.

AMHERST. Amherst was created by the Legislature in 1761, from a part of Albemarle. It is bounded S. W. by Bedford county, or James river; S. by James river or Campbell county; S. E. by James river, or Campbell and Buckingham counties; E. and S. E. by Tye river, or Nelson county; and N. E. by Blue Ridge or Rockbridge county. This county is nearly a parallelogram, 22 by 19 ms; area 418 sq. ms.—It is enclosed on two sides, the S. W. and S. E. by the James river, and entirely drained by the tributaries of that stream. The county generally slopes to the South, its elevation above the Ocean is from 500 to 800 feet;—The soil is naturally fertile, and of the same dark, rich red, which is found so susceptible of improvement in Albemarle, &amp;c.—but the system of Agriculture is bad; and when the land is exhausted it is generally turned out; and the deep red gulleys washed by the rain fill the traveller with feelings of the most gloomy desolation; but it is hoped that the James river improvement by rendering transportation cheaper will induce the farmers to cultivate in wheat, the lands which are now turned out, when too poor for tobacco, and change the appearance of the soil.—The scenery of Amherst is beautifully variegated with mountain, hill, and river. This county belongs to the twelfth judicial 17 circuit, and sixth district. Population in 1820, 10,483,—in 1830, 12,071.— Taxes paid in 1832-3, $2,063 62,—in 1833-4, $3,116 85.

Rose Mills P. O. 127 ms. from R. and 170 S. W. of W. Sandridge's P. O. 142 ms. from R. and 185 S. W. of W. Waugh's Ferry P. O. 142 ms. from R. and 205 S. W. of W. BEDFORD. Bedford was created by the Legislature in 1753, out of a part of Lunenburg county. It is bounded E. and S. E. by Campbell county,—S. and S. W. by Staunton river, branch of Roanoke, separating it from Pittsylvania on the S. and Franklin S. W.—W. and N. W. by the Blue Ridge, which separates it from Botetourt; and N. E. by James river, which separates it from Amherst—Length between the James and Staunton 30 miles, mean breadth 22,—and area 660 sq. ms.—lat from 37° to 37° 32′ N. and long from 2° 10′ to 2° 50′ W. of W. C.—This county for the most part inclines to the S. E.—The inclination terminating in the Peaks of Otter in the N. W. part of the county;—from these Peaks elevated 4,260 feet above the Ocean, Bedford slopes towards her two main boundary streams, the James and Roanoke, and has also lesser inclinations towards her two smaller streams, Goose creek and Otter river—The soil is generally well adapted to farming, equal perhaps to any in Virginia, and had it never been doomed to the curse of excessive tobacco culture, would not have been surpassed by any portion of the state in improvement.—Tobacco has been the principle staple; but many are now turning their attention to the improvement of their land by clover and plaster, and find them astonishingly successful, and the soil capable of high and rapid improvement.—There is a stratum of red clay which is almost impervious to water, and gives durability to an improved soil;—some of the lands on the water-courses are destitute of this quality, and their value is diminished by the defect. The face of the country is generally uneven and in many places broken, especially the south part, from the great western road. The principal streams flowing through the county are Otter and Goose creek, the former rises in the mountains about the sides and base of the Peaks of Otter; the head of the south fork of the latter rises between the celebrated Peaks, on the road passing through Jenning's Gap, and half way from the base to the summit; it is a large spring of delightful water and very powerful at its source, and is so increased by other springs ere it reaches the base of the mountain, that it affords beautiful sites for machinery: after uniting with the north fork it forms a considerable stream, running nearly a south course until it unites with Goose creek, which rises in the S. W. side of the Peaks, and runs first south and then east. It affords many sites for water-works, and many mills are erected on it. The celebrated Peaks of Otter are situated on the south of the road which passes through Jenning's Gap; the county line passes over the northern or Flat Top Peak; this Peak was estimated by Mr. Jefferson to be fourteen or fifteen feet highest, but it is the southern one which has attracted most attention,—its pinnacle being formed of rock piled on rock for forty feet. From this the traveller gazes with delight upon the country below, studded with farms, diminished by the distance to the appearance of gardens, and mountain rising above mountain in endless perspective, whilst immediately beneath his feet the clouds may be pouring their genial showers upon the foot of the mountain. John Randolph of Roanoke, is said to have written some pious lines, upon witnessing this majestic and elevating scene. The spot has been visited also by the eloquent Volney—There are two other peaks in the same range of mountains, which have not been mentioned by travellers or geographers, they are distant five and seven miles from the two former, and are probably of equal height; the old hunters say, that the most northern one, which is called the Apple Orchard, is the highest of all; its name is derived from the appearance of the trees on its top, which resembles an old deserted orchard. The top affords a level of four or five acres of very rich soil, and has springs upon it. The other of these neglected Peaks is called the Onion; it has nothing remarkable about it, except its height. The soil in the lofty elevations of these mountains is astonishingly fertile. Chalybeate Waters, discovered in the south part of the county, have been found to be beneficial in diseases of the skin and debility, but no care being taken of them, they are little known or frequented. There is a cave of some extent on the head waters of Goose creek, of which little is known. The timber of Bedford is generally oak,—white, black, red, Spanish, and box oak,—there is also much good pine in some sections.—Few hogs, and little cattle is raised for market; there are some fine horses raised, and more attention has been lately attracted to this subject. There are about thirty good manufacturing mills in the county, and as many saw mills. About six miles of the James river canal, which passes through the Blue Ridge, lie in this county.—This county belongs to the eighth judicial circuit, and fourth district. Population 1820, 19,305—in 1830, 20,246—Taxes paid in 1833, $4,321 41—in 1834, on lots, $76 09— land, $2538 50—slaves, (No. 4545,) $1136 25—horses, (No. 4670,) $280 20—studs, (No. 33,) $496 00—coaches, (No. 31,) $68 40—carryalls, (No. 7,) $7 00—gigs, (No. 20,) $11 25—Total $4,613 19.

W. part near James river, called Ferguson's mountain; the remainder of the county is generally level. Willis's river rises in the S. part of the county—flows in an eastern direction, enters Cumberland, then turns to the N. E. and empties into the James, 40 miles above Richmond; it is navigable 65 miles from its mouth,—a remarkable circumstance for a river of its length;—its channel rather resembles a canal than a river. Slate river rises in the S. part of this county, flows to the N. E. and empties into the James 3 miles above New Canton, and 63 above Richmond.—Buckingham is by no means wealthy in proportion to its extent,—a large portion of it is barren and uninhabited; on the borders of the water courses the soil is fertile, producing well all the staples, tobacco, wheat, corn, &amp;c.—the intervening ridges are extremely sterile and desolate.—The county contains 7 manufacturing flour mills, capable of grinding from 200 to 250,000 bushels of wheat annually, 5 wool-carding establishments, 8 tanyards, and 40 grist mills.—Slate is found in abundance at the mouth of Slate river.—Iron-ore is found near New Canton.—Gold is found in many places, and one mine is said to be the richest in America. A Mineral Spring has been discovered ten miles S. of New Canton, which is known as the Physic Spring, the waters of which have not been analyzed, but are thought by physicians acquainted with its qualities, to be useful in many diseases, especially those of a chronic nature.—Buckingham belongs to the eighth judicial circuit, and fourth district. Population 1820, 17,582—in 1830, 18,351. Taxes in 1832-3, $5053 25—1833-4, on lots, $67 06—land, $2937 55—on 5817 slaves, $1454 25—3781 horses, $226 86—13 studs, $188 00—88 coaches, $265 75—13 carryalls, $13 00—6 gigs, $40 40.—Total $5132 87.

W. of R., and 138 from W., situated at the mouth of Slate Creek, on an elevated bank about a fourth of a mile from James river, commanding a beautiful perspective view down the river. It was once a place of considerable trade, but has been for sometime rapidly declining. It contains 36 dwelling houses, 3 mercantile stores, 1 tavern, 1 flour manufacturing mill, 1 tanyard, and 1 saddler. A Free house of worship is situated a mile S. of New Canton; and 4 m's. W. the Virginia Mills, by which large quantities of flour are manufactured,—they are situated on Slate river, on which several valuable slate quarries are opened. An iron foundry has lately been opened at New Canton, by which is manufactured all qualities of iron. Immediately on Slate river the country is hilly, but soon becomes very level;—the borders of the river are very fertile, but the level country beyond the hills extremely sterile, except on the flats of creeks. New Canton has 1 attorney, and 1 physician. Population 50. New Store, P. O. 81 m's. from R., and 167 S. W. from W. Oakville, P. V. in the S. W. part of the country, 49 m's S.

H. and from Lynchburg to Stone Wall Mills, 2½ m's. from the line of Campbell Co. It contains but 2 dwelling houses, and a store selling about $10,000 worth of goods annually. The land in the immediate neighbourhood of Oakville is sterile but level, the surrounding country is more fertile, and well adapted to the staples of the state Much tobacco, was formerly raised in this section of country, but the planters are turning their attention more to the cultivation of the other staples, and to improving their land by clover, plaster, &amp;c. There is great variety in the soil, some being dark and stony, some red, and some gray,—the former is most productive. Physic Spring, P. O. 67 m's. W. of R. and 153 from W. Stone Wall Mills, P. O. in the S. W. part of the Co., 108 m's. S. W. of R., and 192 from W., situated on James river, 15 m's. below Lynchburg.

Located in a convenient place for sending produce to market by water; and surrounded by a healthy and wealthy neighbourhood. Population 20. Warren, Ferry, and P. O. 87 m's. W. of R. and 172 from W.—in the W. part of the Co., 10 m's. W. of the C. H. CAMPBELL. Campbell was created by the Legislature in 1784, from a portion of Bedford. It is bounded S. by Staunton, branch of Roanoke, which separates it from Pittsylvania and Halifax, W. by Bedford, N. by James river which separates it from Amherst, S. E. by Buckingham and Prince Edward, and E. by Charlotte. Campbell approximates to a square of 24 m's. on each side, with an area of 576 sq. m's; and extends in lat. from 37° to 37° 26′ N. and long from 1° 46′ to 2° 22′ W. of W. C. There are a few small mountains in Campbell:—both its bounding rivers the Staunton and James are navigable for boats far above its limits; thus opening communication with Chesapeake bay and Albemarle sound. The surface is much broken, but productive in grain, fruit, tobacco, pasturage, &amp;c. Population including the town of Lynchburg in 1820—16,570, in 1830—20,350. Campbell belongs to the eighth judicial circuit, and fourth district. Taxes paid in 1833, $6682 53—1834, on lots, $1666 74—land, $3093 82— 5128 slaves, $1282—3589 horses, $215 34—16 studs, $210 00—88 coaches, $167 10—26 Carryalls, $26 50—57 gigs, $35 60 —Total, $6697 10.

W. from W., and 141 from R., situated at the junction of Otter river with Staunton, on the main southern road—20 m's from Lynchburg, and 25 from the Peak's of Otter, which with several other picturesque mountains are in view. The country around is fertile, rich, well watered, thickly settled and healthy. The village contains several dwelling houses, 1 mercantile store, 1 wheelwright, and a blacksmith shop, with various other mechanics. There are five grist and saw mills from 2 to 4 m's distant; these mills are surrounded with fine timber for building, &amp;c. Population of Arnoldston 15. Brookneal, P. V. 162 m's S. W. by W. of R. and 240 from W., situated in the S. E. part of the county on a beautiful eminence on the north bank of Staunton river, opposite the Seven Islands, a little above the junction of Big Falling river, with Staunton river. It contains 21 houses—10 of which are dwelling houses, 2 mercantile stores, 1 Baptist house of worship, 1 tavern, tan yard, saddler, tailor, boot and shoe factory, tobacco factory, and 2 blacksmith shops; in the vicinity. On Big Falling river is a manufacturing mill. Population 109, of whom 61 are whites, and 48 blacks, and 1 a physician. The falls at this place and for some miles above are very considerable, on both rivers; and fully adequate to the movement of any machinery whatever. The Staunton is the dividing line of Campbell and Halifax, and has at this place a ferry, and on the opposite side a tavern. For some miles above Brookneal there is very little flat land on Staunton river, the hills which abound with fine building rock, running to the waters edge; but at Brookneal the flat land becomes wider and continues to widen for miles below. These flats are very fertile, producing most abundant crops of wheat, corn, oats and tobacco; and some parts also are well adapted to clover and grass The uplands are of common quality, and abound with good oak, and pine timber. There are several fine beds of soap stone, and iron ore in this vicinity. 18 CAMPBELL C. H., P. O. 210 m's. from W., 133 from R. and 12 m's. S. of Lynchburg. Besides the ordinary county buildings it contains 12 dwelling houses, 2 taverns, 1 classical and 1 common school, 2 mercantile stores, 1 tanyard and several mechanics. The public buildings are large, neat and commodious, and the village rapidly improving. The mails arrive and depart 3 times a week. The population is from 90 to 100; of whom 3 are attorneys and 1 a physician. County Courts, are held on the 2d Monday in every month:—Quarterly in March, June, August, and November.

Population 65; of whom 1 is a physician. LYNCHBURG. The town of Lynchburg is situated on the S. or right bank of James river, in the N. W. corner of the county of Campbell, 120 m's. W. from R. and 198 m's. S. W. from W. Its lat. is 37° 36′ N. and its long. 79° 22′ W. from Greenwich. The river in front of the town is about 200 yards wide, and flows to the S. E., giving the same direction to the principal streets. The navigation is difficult, the river being obstructed by shoals, rocks and rapids, throughout a considerable part of its course above tide-water, and admitting only the use of batteaux carrying about 5 tons. Their form is peculiar and excellent. The river is crossed in front of the centre of the town, by a plain wooden bridge, from which, and in the same direction, Water st. leads through the middle of the town, crossing the other streets at right angles. On the N. W. side, the town is limited by the abrupt bank of Black Water creek, which flowing N. E. enters. James river a little above the bridge. The river banks on the N. E. side are broken, precipitant and elevated; presenting, in connection with the distant view of the Blue Ridge and the Peaks of Otter, a scenery which has been universally admired for its beauty and boldness. In some situations, the banks of the river disclose strata of earth in a manner highly interesting and instructive to the geological student. Lynchburg stands in a primitive region, abounding in several varieties of the grantic rocks. Mica slate, hornblende, chlorites, quartz, and various ores of iron, are often met with; and among the rarer minerals, lithomarge, an oxide of titanium, cyenite, asbestos, &amp;c. Gold, in small quantities, has been found in the neighbourhood. The quarries produce a compact mica slate, capable of being wrought easily with the chisel into blocks, having the closest resemblance to granite, and affording a building material highly valuable, but as yet too little appreciated. The streets parallel to the river, which have been more or less built upon, are 10 in number. Of these, the 2d or "Main street" is the principal. Almost all the shops and stores of the town are situated on this street; and for the distance of about three quarters of a mile, it presents continuous rows of tolerably well built houses. Main st. together with 3d, (the next in order, proceeding from the river,) occupies a bench on the river bank, at an elevation of about 125 feet; while 4th st. is nearly 100 feet higher; lying only a little below the common level of the country. These streets are crossed at right angles by 10 or 12 alleys, having Water st. in the middle, which between 3d and 4th streets, is too precipitous for the use of carriages of any kind. The number of houses is between 8 and 900. The court house, market house, and other public buildings, excepting a substantial stone jail, are in a style of architecture which does no credit to the place. The principal hotels are the Franklin and the Union, on Main st., and the Washington on 3d st. Several of the private dwellings would be considered ornamental to any city. The churches, in the order of their erection, are the Methodist Episcopal, the 1st Presbyterian, the 1st Baptist, the Protestant Episcopal Church of St. Paul's, the 2d Baptist, the Methodist. Protestant, the 2d Presbyterian, and a Friend's meeting house in the vicinity of the town. These buildings, 5 of which stand on 3d st. are mostly quite plain; 1 or 2 only having any pretensions to architectural propriety or ornament. Among the mechanics of Lynchburg are found—distributed in the usual proportions of an inland town, bakers, blacksmiths, cabinet makers, carpenters, carriage makers, chair makers, coopers, coppersmiths, gun smiths, hatters, masons, painters, printers, rope makers, saddlers, shoemakers, silversmiths, tallow chandlers, tanners, tailors, tinners, turners, tobacconists, &amp;c. The principal manufacturing establishments within the town, are a large and excellent flour mill and a saw mill, on Black Water creek, with a number of others in the neighbourhood, a carding machine on a rivulet at the lower end of the town, several brick yards, 2 extensive tanyards, and a good many tobacco factories, for stemming, manufacturing, &amp;c. These factories give employment to many hundred hands. A cotton factory on the right bank of Black Water creek, erected by the Lynchburg Manufacturing Company with a capital of $100,000, and intended to run 2500 spindles, and give employment to about 70 persons, is just getting into operation. This is the first attempt of any importance to carry on the cotton manufacture in S. W. Virginia; the success of the enterprise is confidently anticipated, and the hope is cherished that other capitalists may be induced to embark in similar undertakings among us, until at least the wants of the country depending upon Lynchburg are supplied with domestic fabrics of our own production. The Lynchburg Water Works, for furnishing the town with an unfailing supply of pure and wholesome water, were constructed in 1828-29, under the direction of Albert Stein, esq. Engineer, at an expense of $50,000. The height—unprecedented in this country—to which it was necessary to raise the water, renders this one of the most interesting undertakings of the kind in the United States. An arm of the James, formed by an island about 2 miles in length, is crossed, a short distance above the limits of the corporation, by a dram 10 feet high. A canal of half a mile in length conveys the water to the pump house on the river bank, at the foot of 3rd alley. A double forcing pump on the plan of De la Hire, worked by a large breast wheel, impels the water through the ascending pipe which is 200 feet long, to a reservoir containing 400,000 gallons, situated between 4th and 5th streets, and at the elevation of 240 feet above the level of the river. Fire plugs are connected with the distributing pipes at every intersection of the alleys with 2nd and 3rd streets, and afford an admirable security against the danger of fire. The height of the reservoir, above these streets (the only ones compactly built), gives a jet of water by means of hose pipes, of from 60 to 80 feet elevation, and throws it, in bold and continuous streams, over the roofs of the highest houses. The water is extensively taken by the inhabitants, and the rents are already accumulating a sinking fund for liquidating the debt incurred in constructing these valuable works. The water power created by the dam for the water works, is amply sufficient for working a large additional amount of machinery, and waits only for a clearer perception by capitalists of the manufacturing advantages of this town, to be brought into extensive use. The cheapness of labour, the abundance of provisions, and the extent and wealth of the country looking this way for its supplies of domestic as well as of foreign goods, unite with the vast water power actually prepared and ready for any application, in inviting the attention of men of capital and enterprise, to this important subject. Lynchburg has suffered much from the want of good roads, by which the products of the surrounding country might be conveyed to her market. The recent improvements, however, are important. The road to Charlottesville, distant 70 m's. N. E. has been skilfully graduated, and in spite of an uncommonly broken country, is now traversed with expedition and ease. The Richmond road is now being turnpiked to Chilton's, 15 m's. from Lynchburg—the only part of the route that particularly required this mode of improvement. An excellent turnpike is now nearly completed from this place to Lexington, by the way of the Blue Ridge Canal on James river. This road passes near the Natural Bridge, 30 m's. from Lynchburg. A similar road having already been opened westward from Lexington to Covington, the most direct route from the lower country to the Virginia Springs, will now be found to lead through Lynchburg. The Lynchburg and eastern turnpike, running S. W. through New London and Liberty, is now completed half the distance. This is an expensive macadimised road. It enters Lynchburg at the lower end of the town; to accommodate the wants of the other end, an arm has been constructed from Cocke, or West street, (the northernmost alley,) intersecting the turnpike a mile and a half from town. The "Piedmont road," by Charlottesville, Lynchburg, Danville, Salem, N. C. &amp;c. having lately been made the route for the great southern mail, the public at large have additional inducements for improving the portion of it between Lynchburg and Danville. A good thoroughfare in this direction would prove an important accession to the commercial facilites of this town. A mail coach passes to and from Richmond 3 times a week; the line continues westward to Lewisburg in Greenbriar county, passing by Liberty in Bedford county, Fincastle in Botetourt county, and the Sweet and White Sulphur Springs, intersecting the line from Richmond by way of Charlottesville at the latter place Just beyond the Blue Ridge, a branch of this line extends to Salem, where it joins the line passing up the Valley from Staunton &amp;c. Another mail coach passes between this place and Washington city, by way of Charlottesville 3 times a week; this line extends on south into Georgia. The commercial relations of Lynchburg are extensive, embracing a large tract of country to the south and west. Exclusive of an important section of Virginia, the N. W. parts of North Carolina, and many counties in east Tennessee communicate with the Atlantic ports through this town. The recent arrangements for carrying through the long contemplated improvements connecting the James and Kanawha rivers, are likely to affect the trade and prosperity of the place; but whether prosperously or adversely, time must develope. In the year 1832, a charter was obtained for "the Lynchburg and New River Rail Road Company," and a large amount of stock taken. Circumstances caused the abandonment of that undertaking; yet so important is it for Lynchburg to secure its S. W. trade, to the greatest extent, that the connection of the waters of the Tennessee with the James river at this place, is an enterprise that ought never to be lost sight of. One of the richest sections of the Union will find this its most direct route to the Atlantic markets. The staple article of trade in Lynchburg is tobacco; for the inspection and storage of which there are in different parts of the town, 7 large warehouses. So fertile and productive were—and in a measure, still are— the tobacco lands of the country trading to Lynchburg, that in regard to the quantity inspected, the place has long been the largest tobacco market in the world. The following is a tabular view of the statistics of the Tobacco Trade of Lynchburg for the last 12 years, including a statement of the inspections at Richmond and Petersburg: For the year ending LYNCHBURG.

Many intelligent planters, foreseeing the inevitable course of things, are by degrees abandoning the culture of the plant, and giving an increased attention to the growing of wheat and the improvement of their overcropped lands. There is not in the Union a soil superior to theirs if properly managed. Their success in clover and wheat will animate the spirit of agricultural improvement, check the tide of emigration, and by furnishing increased quantities of merchantable produce, afford the surest guarantee for the permanent prosperity of their market town. The Lynchburg branch of the Bank of Virginia has a capital of $300,000, and that of the Farmers' Bank of Virginia, a capital of $— —. There are also two Savings Banks, paying interest on deposites. The beneficial effects of these admirable institutions are widely felt. The most important Benevolent Societies of Lynchburg are, a Bible Society, auxiliary to the American Bible Society, instituted in the year 1815;—a Colonization Society, instituted in 1826, which has been instrumental in sending out many people of color as colonists to Liberia,—and a numerous and influential Temperance Society. Lynchburg has no incorporated seminary of learning. The business of education is left entirely to individual enterprise. There is a good classical and mathematical school, several schools for both sexes, and others for young ladies exclusively—of which one is furnished with an extensive and costly Philosophical Apparatus. The town labors under the reproach of having no public library. In addition to the "Lynchburg Virginian," a semi-weekly paper of long standing, another, also semi-weekly, has lately been established. The town was established in the year 1786, but so slow was its progress that in 1793, it contained but five houses. The charter of incorporation was obtained in 1805. Population in 1830, 4,630, including 12 resident attorneys, and 15 practising physicians. Marysville, P. V. 147 m's S. W. by W. of R., and 225 from W., situated in the S. part of the county, 20 m's S. W. of Lynchburg, and 15 m's S. of Campbell C. H., in a thickly settled and wealthy neighbourhood, on Seneca creek, a mile above its junction with Staunton river. It contains 20 dwelling houses, 2 mercantile stores, 1 manufacturing flour mill, a tanyard, and various mechanics. Seneca creek has lately been improved by the Roanoke Company, and boats can now come up to the mill. Popuation 50. Moreman's P. O. 221 m's. from W., and 143 from R. New London, P. V. near the W. border of Campbell, 209 m's. from W. and 131 from R. New London is an incorporated town, situated on the Lynchburg and Salem turnpike, 11 m's S. W. of the former, and 50 E. of the latter. It contains 25 dwelling houses, 2 mercantile stores, 2 taverns, and 1 handsome Methodist meeting house, a rope walk, blacksmith shop, wheelwright, tanyard, and 2 saddlers. The New London Academy is situated a mile W. of the town. At this institution a student may be prepared to enter any of the colleges or Universities with credit. There were in 1834, 50 pupils:—the buildings consist of a handsome and commodious Academy, a presidents' house, and a large brick church well enclosed. The Bedford and Campbell Agricultural Society, holds its meetings at New London. There is a merchant mill on Buffalo creek, about half a mile west of the town, and another about the same distance south, both on a very extensive scale. Population 100. New London was founded about the year 1750, and about the time of the American revolution contained perhaps thrice its present number of inhabitants. There was then established at this place a United States armory, and its artisans, which have since been removed to Harpers Ferry:— Five or six Scotch merchants, who were largely engaged in business about the commencement of the revolution, refused to take the oath of allegiance, broke up their establishments, and left the country. These circumstances combining with the establishment of Lynchburg so near it on James river, have given a shock to the prosperity of the town from which it cannot recover. Under the old district system the Superior Court was held at New London. RED HILL, situated in the S. E. part of the county, on the borders of this county and Charlotte, about three miles below Brookneal; on the Staunton river—The residence of PATRICK HENRY, and the burial place of himself and his lady. Reedy Spring, P. O. 110 ms. from R. and 196 S. W. of W. Yellow Branch, P. O. 135 ms. S. W. of R. and 213 from W. CAROLINE. Caroline was created by the House of Burgesses, in February, 1727, (in the language of the act) "on the heads of Essex, King and Queen, and King William."—The first court was held under a commission from Governor Gooch, in May 1728.—It is bounded N. by the Rappahannock which separates it from King George, N. W. by same river separating it from Stafford,—N. E. by Essex,—E. and S. E. by King and Queen, and King William,—S. S. W. by the Pamunkey, which separates it from Hanover,—and W. by Spottsylvania.—Its shape is nearly a parallelogram, in length 30 miles from N. E. to S. W. and in breadth 20;—area 600 sq. ms. —lat. 37° 4′ to 38° 16′ N. and long. 0° 2′ to 0° 43′ W. of W. C.—The surface is much broken, and the soil presents great variety. The Rappahannock and Pamunkey are on the borders of this county, and the Mattapony runs a little south of its centre, the low grounds of these rivers are admirably adapted to the culture of Indian corn, wheat, and tobacco,—indeed for the first they are said to be the best lands in the state.— Its principal villages are Bowling Green and Port Royal, and its Academies Rappahannock and Concord. Caroline was formerly divided into three parishes, Drysdale and St. Mary's, created in 1727, and St. Margarett's, in 1744, in each of which a church was placed, only St. Margaretts remains: —but there are many other churches and meeting houses in the county, which belong principally to the prevailing denomination—the Baptist. The people are religious, and remarkable for their wealth, hospitality and intelligence;—it was the birth place of the republican John Taylor,—the highly gifted Edmund Pendleton, and the chivalric General Woodford. Population, 1820, 18,008—in 1830, 17,744.—Caroline belongs to the fifth judicial circuit, and third district. Taxes paid in 1833, $4440 82 —1834, on lots, $62 71—lands, $2355 22—on 5581 slaves, $1395 25— 3015 horses, $180 90—11 studs, $133 00—on 71 coaches, $180 56— 4 stages, $6 50—93 carryalls, $97 25—218 gigs, $121 94—Total, $45 33 33.

There are 29 dwelling houses, 3 mercantile stores, 1 grist and saw mill, 1 coach and wagon manufactory, 2 blacksmiths, 1 tanyard, 2 tailors, 2 bricklayers, 1 house-joiner, and 2 boot and shoe factories; 2 elementary schools, one for each sex; 1 well organized Sunday school, and 1 temperance society, also a female benevolent association, which has a fair annually, the profits of which are appropriated to benevolent purposes. This village is located on a beautiful level green, ornamented with fine trees, it derives its present name from the nature of its location, its original name was New Hope.—The seat of county justice was removed to this place in 1805. The railroad now under contract between Fredericksburg and Richmond, is expected to make this village a place of considerable trade.—A line of stages running N. and S. pass here twice a day; and two cross mails from E. to W.—The surrounding country is remarkable for its healthiness and fertility, producing abundantly all the staples of the state. Population 317 persons, of whom 6 are attorneys, and 2 physicians. County Courts are held on the 2d Monday in every month.—Quarterly in March, June, August, and November.

It contains 236 houses, 2 houses of public worship, 1 methodist and 1 Episcopalian, 6 mercantile stores, and 1 merchant mill. The mechanics are a tanner, saddler, carriage maker, and ship builder. Population in 1830, 600; 2 of whom are attorneys, and 2 physicians. Port Royal was created a town by the House of Burgesses in 1744.—It possesses a fine harbor, which readily admits vessels drawing eleven feet water, it was formerly one of the principal markets in the state for tobacco, but has now lost this important trade; it yet however exports large quantities of wheat and Indian corn. —Two steamboats regularly stop four times a week at this place on their route between Fredericksburg and Baltimore.

Judge Upshur holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 1st of April and 12th of October. 19 CHARLOTTE. Charlotte was created by the Legislature in 1764, from a part of Lunenburg county. The Southwestern border of Charlotte is washed by Staunton river, which separates it from Halifax. On the west, the line which separates Charlotte from Campbell runs on a ridge of highlands which give rise to waters flowing westwardly into Falling river, and eastwardly into Turnip creek. On the N. and N. E. the line, which separates Charlotte from Prince Edward, runs on a ridge of high lands, which give rise to waters flowing north and northeastwardly into the Appomatox, and south into the Staunton river. On the E. and S. E. the line, which separates Charlotte from Lunenburg, runs on a ridge which gives rise to waters flowing southeastwardly into the Meherrin, and westwardly into tributary streams of Staunton. On the S. the line which separates Charlotte from Mecklenburg, runs on a ridge, which gives rise to waters flowing south into the Meherrin and northwestwardly into Bluestone. Length 22 miles, mean breadth 18, and area 600 sq. miles: extending in lat. from 36° 41′ to 37° 16′ N. and in long from 10° 33′ to 2° 05′ W. of W. C.— Charlotte county contains by actual surveys as entered on the commissioner's books, about 310,000 acres of land, valued, together with buildings, under the equalizing laws, to something near 2,275,000 dollars; the average price per acre under that calculation including buildings is $8 75. The buildings being valued at nearly 356,000 dollars; the average price per acre without the buildings is about $7 60.—The census taken in the year 1830, gives to the county, 15,252 souls—shewing about 20 acres to each individual in the county. The general surface of the county is greatly diversified with hills and vales, embracing every variety of soil, and is watered by numerous creeks and rivulets all tributary to Staunton river, except the head branches of the Meherrin, on the E. and S. E. The principal streams of Charlotte flowing into Staunton and its tributaries, are the following. The first, beginning in the western part of Charlotte, is Turnip Creek, the head waters of which rise in the neighborhood of the Red House, near the Campbell line, it runs south and enters Staunton river just above Cole's Ferry. This is not a large stream, yet it affords considerable bottom or flat land, especially at and near its mouth. It is from 15 to 20 miles in length. The next in order, proceeding southeastwardly is Cub Creek, the head branches of which are in Campbell county, from the place which it enters the county to its junction with Staunton, the distance is from 30 to 40 miles. It has many tributary streams;—those on the west are Bear Creek, rising near the Red House. Turkey Cock and Louse Creek,—the two first are inconsiderable streams, the last is from 10 to 12 miles in length and at and near its junction with Cub creek, a little above Baldwin's mills, affords much valuable bottom lands. Those on the E. are Little Cub, Horsepen, Rough creek, and Terry's creek. Cub creek with its tributary streams waters a large and valuable portion of the upper end of Charlotte, affording a considerable quantity of rich bottom land and hill sides well suited to the growth of the various kinds of grain, and in many places, producing tobacco of the finest quality. It enters Staunton river 3 or 4 miles below Cole's Ferry. Next is Wallace's creek. Its head spring is near the road leading from Charlotte court house to Cole's Ferry, it flows through a neighborhood of very good land, and enters Staunton just above Morton's Ferry: it is from 9 to 10 miles in length. Next in order is Little Roanoke; which rises in the northeastern part of Charlotte, near the Prince Edward line, and runs southwest through the county and empties into Staunton river about 4 miles below Clark's Ferry. It is from 25 to 30 miles in length. This stream with its tributaries, waters a great part of the lower end of Charlotte, as well as a valuable part of the upper end. It is a low, flat and sluggish stream, affording very little fall of water, and contains as much bottom land as any in the state of its size and length; particularly at its mouth; where there is a body of rich low grounds, including those on Staunton, of fully a thousand acres. Randolph's Lower Quarter, situated below its mouth, itself contains between 7 and 800 acres in one body. The principal tributary stream, to Little Roanoke, on the west, is Wardsfork; which rises in the neighborhood of Chickentown in the upper end, and with its tributaries, waters the best tobacco land in the county; indeed the lands on this stream are remarkable for their universal fertility. It flows into L. Roanoke on a low bed at right angles—hence a large body of low grounds, the largest in the interior of the county, was for a long time under water and considered irreclaimable. These grounds remained common until within a few years past, and were so injurious to health as to be considered a public nuisance. About the year 1817 James W. Bouldin purchased a tract of land immediately in the fork, containing bottom lands on both streams, and commenced reclaiming. About the year 1819 his brother Judge Bouldin purchased a tract above on L. Roanoke, and commenced draining: the plan of draining as it relates to the courses and location of the ditches on both purchases was laid out and executed under the direction of James W. Bouldin. By these means, certainly the largest, if not the finest body of low grounds, in the neighborhood of the Courthouse, is, from a wilderness of bogs, mire and stagnant waters, rendered arable and comparatively healthy. The next tributary on the west is Dunnivant; which rises in the neighborhood of Edmond's Store, and flows through a neighborhood of good land, into L. Roanoke, just above Dabbs' Bridge. On the E. the first tributary stream is Hell's creek, though a small stream, it affords much good bottom land, particularly towards its mouth. It enters Little Roanoke just below L. Roanoke bridge. Next in order are Spencer's and Spring creeks, rising on the dividing ridge, which separates Charlotte from Prince Edward and Lunenburg. They unite just before they flow into Little Roanoke. Just below their junction and at their mouth, there is a large body of valuable flat land. That which lies above, immediately on L. Roanoke, is of the pipe clay soil and was formerly liable to inundations. Much has been done for its recovery from water and to improve its quality, still it is not equal to land above and below it. Next is Ash Camp, it rises in the neighborhood of Keysville, in a poor country, but as you descend this creek, the quantity and quality of the bottom lands increase. Next is Twitties' Creek. It rises on the ridge, which separates the waters of Meherrin from those of Staunton river. This is a longer and larger stream than those just mentioned. It affords a considerable quantity of flat lands, yet with some few exceptions, the plantations on this stream are not remarkable for their productions. It enters Little Roanoke on a tract of land on which the late Judge Paul Carrington, Jr. resided; it is considered very valuable. The first brick house in the county was built on this tract. The next streams are the Horsepens. They rise on the same ridge, the branches of which water a great part of the southeast of Charlotte. The head streams rise in and run through a body of as poor lands as any in the state, but as you approach their mouths, the quantity and quality of good lands increase, and after they unite the Horsepen affords much valuable low grounds. It enters L. Roanoke just above John Randolph's Lower Quarter. Reynold's Creek is a tributary to this stream. It rises on the road that leads from the Double Bridges in Lunenburg to Moseley's Ferry. It runs through a neighborhood once of very fine lands, but much exhausted by cultivation; it enters the Horsepen just below Bedford's Bridge. Next to L. Roanoke on the S. we come to Sandy Creek. In this portion of the county the soil and quality of the lands are essentially different from those in other parts. The soil is universally sandy or gravelly, and upon a slight view, it would appear to those who lived on lands of a different texture, to be very unproductive; but it is known to be as productive for all kinds of grain and grass as any in the county, similarly situated, and of late years tobacco is produced of fine quality by judicious cultivators. Those who live on these lands, say that they vegetate quickly, are soon exhausted, but revive speedily, when proper measures are used. Several valuable plantations lie on Sandy Creek, near its mouth. It is a short stream, and enters Staunton a little above Moseley's Ferry. After leaving Sandy Creek, the county becomes very narrow to its southern extremity, a ridge running between Bluestone and Staunton to its termination. The first tributary, to Staunton after leaving Sandy Creek, is Buffaloe. This stream rises in the neighborhood of Jeffrey's Store and runs into Staunton river, a few miles below Moseley's Ferry. The next are Cargil's and Hogan's Creeks. Two small streams watering the extreme south of the county. Hogan's Creek with its branches water some very valuable land. Bluestone affords to this county some very valuable land, originally very fine, having a red clay foundation with mulatto soil. Staunton river gives to this county as much valuable bottom lands, as it does to any county on its waters. On the western extremity of the county, at the mouth of Falling river, lived and died the distinguished Patrick Henry. His residence was on the termination of the ridge, which separates Charlotte from Campbell. It is called Red Hill, from which there is a very handsome southern view of a very large body of rich low grounds, estimated at 500 acres. It is now the property of his two youngest sons. The remains of the orator and his lady repose on the spot. The next most conspicuous place on the river, proceeding southwardly, is called Ward's Neck, situated just above the mouth of Cub Creek, between that and Cole's Ferry, it is embraced by a large bend or curve of the river, corresponding with the Cove in Halifax, which lies just below it on the opposite side of the river. It affords several beautiful situations for buildings, on elevated, fertile and level table lands, skirted by the richest and most fertile low grounds or river bottoms. The next place just below Clark's Ferry, is the residence of the late John Randolph of Roanoke. Proceeding southwest from the Courthouse, on the main southern stage road, when getting within a mile of Clark's Ferry, a left hand road leads up a gentle assent to the summit of the only hill in the county, dignified by the name of mountain. On this summit stands the buildings, late the residence of this illustrious orator. They are situated literally in the woods; for there is not a vestige of land cultivated in view—they consist of two plain wooden buildings, of one story each, with two rooms on a floor, within a few steps of each other; the back building, which he mostly occupied, is entered through a piazza, on a pebble floor, the roof of which is supported by unhewn posts taken immediately from the forest. Notwithstanding the simplicity of the outward appearance of these buildings, within the furniture, plate, paintings and library corresponded with the elevated characted of their owner, essentially rich but plain. A few steps to the west of the front building under a large pine tree, is interred the body of that Man, whose inimitable eloquence once electrified the people of the United States, and whose fame almost reached the remotest bounds of the civilized world. Immediately below Mr Randolph's, near the junction of the L. Roanoke with Staunton river, on an elevated and beautiful site, stands the residence of the late Judge Paul Carrington, Sen. It is now the property of his youngest son. Judge Carrington was a member of the bar of the county of Charlotte, when the county court was organized in the year 1765, he had been a practising lawyer and a member of the House of Burgesses, when this county was a part of Lunenburg. After the British Governor, Lord Dunmore, had abdicated the government of Virginia, a convention met in Richmond in the year 1775, to organize a provincial form of government and plan of defence for the colony. This plan of defence was submitted by them to a committee of public safety. Paul Carrington was one of that committee. He subsequently became a Judge of the Court of Appeals, in which office he remained until a few years previous to his death. After leaving the lands at the mouth of the L. Roanoke, the quantity and quality of the low grounds decrease, so far as the county of Charlotte reaches on the river. Upon a general view of the soil, it may be said, that it is generous and free—that most of the wood, on the streams and hill sides has been cut down, the hill sides much exhausted, yet the bottom lands are generally productive, more especially where they are, in the hands of judicious cultivators. Our ridges contain the only forests, and they are mostly poor and barren—valuable only for their timbers. These remarks hold good generally, except those tracts in possession of large land holders, on some of which, there are still some good bottom and high lands uncleared, particularly on L. Roanoke, Cub creek and Wardsfork. Agriculturalists say with confidence, that it is found by a proper course of cultivation, that all exhausted lands, originally good, especially those with red clay foundations are recoverable, and can be brought back to their original fertility—if so, it is confidently hoped that a spirit of improvement in agriculture may prevail, which will effect this object. Minerals.—There is a singular vein of stone running through the county nearly from N. to S. It is composed of a series of round stones of various sizes, sometimes very large;—the vein in some places is barely perceptible, consisting of only a few round pebbles, in others it protrudes a rugged mass of rocks. Gold and Silver have been diligently sought, but not found. Elections.—There are 3 precinct elections in the county—1 at Harvey's store in Chicken-town, 1 at Fuqua's store, above Louse creek, both in the upper end of the county; and 1 at M'Cargo's in the lower end, near Williesburg. Poor.—The County Court has lately purchased land and erected buildings about 7 miles from the C. H. for the accommodation of the poor. The present inmates are 6 males, and 9 females. This arrangement is expected to lessen considerably the poor rates of the county. Society.—The great men who have resided in Charlotte, and the many pious and good men which she has produced, operating by their example and exertions upon an intelligent community, have given to Charlotte society a tone of dignified and lofty sentiment, not often met with, and not soon to be laid aside. Two Agricultural Societies have lately been formed in the county; 1 at Charlotte C. H., the other near Wyliesburg in the lower end. These societies embrace the most wealthy and enterprising citizens of their respective neighbourhoods. The Main Western Road, from the east, leading by Prince Edward C. H. enters this county near the sources of Spring creek, after entering the county, the main or right branch crosses Cub creek at Harvey's bridge, thence by the Red House to Lynchburg and Campbel C. H. The left leads on by Rough creek church, crosses Cub creek, at Rawlins' bridge, after which it branches, the right goes on the ridge, on the head waters of Louse creek and Turkey cock, and intersects with a road leading from Cole's ferry, by the Red House, to Lynchburg. The left, at Rawlins' bridge, leads on by Chappel's shop, and Gaines'; crosses Louse creek at Dennis', thence to Fuqua's store—after which it again branches the first right leads on to Hat creek in Campbell, the next to Booker's ferry and Red hill, crossing Turnip creek at Oliver's, just below Bruce's mill. The left to Cole's ferry. The next road that enters the county from the east by Prince Edward C. H. is the main southern stage road—it enters the county near the head waters of L. Roanoke, crosses that stream at L. Roanoke bridge, crosses Dunnevant, at Spencer's, thence to Charlotte C. H., a little above which, it branches the right leading across Woodsfork to Price's old field, where it again branches, the right leading to White's tavern, where a left leads to the Red House, where it intersects with the main western road. The left at Price's old field leads to the road leading from Rough creek church to Booker's ferry, and to Cole's ferry. The left above Charlotte C. H. is the continuation of the stage road, and leads to Morton's ferry, and to Clark's ferry. The next road that passes through the county from the east, is by Moor's old ordinary in Prince Edward, it enters the county at Clark's, where it immediately branches. The right leads to L. Roanoke bridge; and thence to the main western road near Chicken town: the left at Clark's leads to Keysville, thence to Charlotte C. H. At Keysville it branches, the right leading on the ridge between Ash camp and Tuelties' creek to Bouldin's old store,* * This place, Bouldin's old store, is one of the oldest-settlements in this county; the settlement was made by Col. Thomas Bouldin, who removed from Maryland, and settled here—within a few hundred yards of this place was buried the late Thomas T. Bouldin, deceased, here are buried also his father and grand father. Here also resides his mother, the sister of the late governor Tyler, active and healthy at the advanced age of 82 years. Seldom does it occur in this country, that the same family resides at the same place for so long a time. thence to Charlotte C. H. and thence it intersects with Booker's ferry road at Harris's. The next road, that enters the county from the east, is one that crosses the Double Bridges in Lunenburg; it enters the county near Hayleysburg, thence by Eubank's store to Brigdewater's, near which place it branches. The left leading on the ridge separating the waters of Meherrin from a branch of the Bluestone, to Mack Goode's. The right or main road at Brigewater's leads by Leciprus' store, and M'Cargo's to Wyliesburg, when it branches; the right leads across Sandy creek by Brock's, to Moseley's ferry; the left leads to Callicote's, thence to Brook's where it intersects with the Mosely ferry road, to Jeffries' store, to Blank's ferry, and to Clarksville and Abbeyville, in Mecklenburg.

The road leading by Charlotte C. H., and Reed's mill to Clark's ferry, is the dividing line of these 2 divisions. CHESTERFIELD. Chesterfield was created by the House of Burgesses in 1748, from a part of Henrico. It is bounded N. by the James which separates it from Henrico, and Charles City,—E. S. E. by the Appomattox, which separates it from Prince George,—S. and S. W. by the same river, separating it from Dinwiddie S. and Amelia S. W.—and W. N. W. by Powhatan. Extreme length from the junction of Appomattox with James, to the western angle 38 miles, mean breadth 12,—area 456 square miles. Lat 37° 10′ to 37° 31′ N. and long 0° 22′ to 1° 05′ W. of W. C.—The surface is broken, and the soil is poor except on the rivers.—The most profitable railroad in the world is in this county, from James river to the coal mines, a distance of 13 miles. We subjoin an account of these mines from the pen of a traveller: "These coal mines are on the south side of James river, about twelve miles above the city of Richmond. At this city the granite rock makes its appearance. It forms the bed of the river, and affords an inexhaustible water power. On the road to the Chesterfield mines, rocks are not seen until you get near the mines. The country is rolling, and has the aspect of barrenness and poverty—yet good husbandry would soon give to it freshness and beauty.—The elevation is gradual to the west, and as far as I could judge, the summit level, at the mouth of the Maidenhead mine, is about 300 feet above the tide water in James river. "Within the circumference of about a mile square, there have been several mines opened and seven or eight are now wrought. The rock is not many feet below the surface, and is from two hundred and fifty to four hundred and fifty feet thick. The prevailing rock is a light grey coarse sand stone—rather hard and some of it sparkling with chrystalized quartz. This rock alternates with a bluish clay in a state of considerable compactness, and with shell.—Much of these last two are so filled with the sulphate of iron, minutely disseminated, that they soon decompose in the atmosphere. There is no trace of the lime rock, nor as yet of the old red sand stone. It is doubtful, however, whether they have reached the bottom of the coal formation. At the bottom of one of the shafts, the floor upon which the coal rests is called granite—but from the description of the rock, I concluded it must be the hardest of the seinite rocks. "The coal here is bituminous. The basins appear to be small, and the colliers complain of the faults and troubles in them. The coal seams are from a few inches to several feet in thickness—one has been found nearly twenty feet thick. The dip rarely exceeds forty-five degrees. Wooldridge's mine is the deepest and the only one which has a steam engine to raise the coal and the water out of the pit. The others employ mules. The mines are worked day and night, except Sundays—when the water is drawn as often as necessary to keep the works below from being flooded. Drifts are cut from the foot of the shafts, and some of those have been carried out several hundred yards. These are said to be from ten to twenty feet wide, and from five to twenty or thirty feet high. Mules are employed in the mines to draw the coal to the foot of the shafts. These are fed and stabled in the chambers of the mine. Nevertheless, they keep fat. And what is certainly not a little remarkable to a novice, these mines abound in rats. They go down, it seems, on the ropes, attracted into these tartarean abodes by the provisions and provender, which are sent down for the negroes and mules. The negroes prefer this to labor in the field. "All these mines raise about two hundred tons of coal in each twenty-four hours. This coal is sent daily, (Sundays excepted,) in a team of seventy to a hundred cars, over a fine rail-way thirteen miles, to the river. "There are several valuable coal mines on the north side of James river, in the western part of Henrico county. Coal has likewise been discovered in Goochland and Powhatan counties." Chesterfield belongs to the seventh judicial circuit, and fourth district. Population in 1820, 18,003—in 1830, 18,637.

Bellona Arsenal, a United States military post, situated on beautiful elevated ground, on the south side of James river, 14 ms. above Richmond, 135 from W. and 2 south of Bellona P. O., Henrico county. It was established in 1816-17, since which time it has been garrisoned by a company of U. S. Artillery. It has been a depot for a considerable quantity of military stores, and during a great portion of the time since its construction, a number of artificers have been employed in repairing and fabricating 20 small arms and other munitions of war. Immediately adjacent to the Arsenal, is Bellona Foundry, owned by Major John Clarke, who for a number of years past has been casting cannon,—under an annual contract with the government.—The guns made at this place are said to be unsurpassed in quality by any made in the United States. In consequence of the continuous expense and inconvenience of transportation to and from the arsenal—of the extreme difficulty arising from its isolated location, of obtaining and retaining the mechanics necessary for an arsenal of construction—of the unsafe condition of the property at a point, where from its contiguity to the coal pits, a greater number of negroes could be collected in a few hours, than at any other place in the commonwealth and of the reputed unhealthiness of the place,—an order has lately been issued for abandoning the post and removing the troops and property to Fort Monroe at Old Point Comfort. Colesville, P. O. 36 ms. S. W. of R. and 158 from W. in the S. W. angle of the county. Goodsbridge, P. O. 38 ms. S. W. of R. and 160 from W. Hallsboro', P. V. 17 ms. from R. and 139 from W.—situated on the Buckingham road leading from Richmond to Lynchburg, 15 ms. from Scottsville in Powhatan county,—in a healthy and pleasant neighborhood. The soil in the vicinity is rather poor, and most adapted to the culture of oats and corn.—It contains several dwelling houses, 1 large Baptist meeting house, (called "Bethel,") a large, comfortable, and convenient tavern, a mercantile store, and a common school. The Lynchburg stage passes every day in the week. Hatchersville, P. O. 11 ms. from R. and 133 from W. Manchester, P. V. 123 ms. from W. and 1 from R,—pleasantly situated on the margin of James river, opposite to Richmond, to which it is united by Mayo's bridge across the rapids. It contains about 360 houses, 2 houses of worship, 1 Methodist and the other Baptist, 2 common schools, 6 grocery stores, 1 cotton seed oil mill, 1 cotton factory, with a capital of $70,000, 8 tobacco manufactories, 1 poor asylum, and 1 merchant mill. The principal mechanical pursuits are, house-carpentry, cabinet making, (to considerable extent,) coach making, blacksmith's work, &amp;c. Population 1500 persons; of whom two are attorneys, and three physicians. The Chesterfield and Manchester Rail Road connects the strata of bituminous coal on James river, with its tide water, at Manchester;—It extends 13½ miles in a single track, with several turn-outs, and 1½ mile branchroads to the coal beds.—The company was incorporated by the Legislature in 1829, commenced work in January, 1830, and was opened for use in July, 1831. This road was so profitable as to afford a dividend of TEN PER CENT to the stockholders in the first six months;—A result which has not been equalled by any improvement in the United States, perhaps in the world. The cost of the road was $8,000 per mile; and including wagons, horses, &amp;c. the whole disbursement of the company has been about $140,000: or $10,370 per mile. Vadensburg, P. O. 20 ms. S. of R. and 142 from W. CULPEPER. Culpeper was created by the Legislature in 1778 from a part of Orange. It is bounded N. and N. E. by the North Fork of Rappahannock river, which separates it from Fauquier N. and Stafford E. N. E.—E. and S. E. by the Rapid Ann river, which separates it from Spottsylvania E. and Orange S. E.—S. and S. W. by Orange,—W. and N. W. by the new county of Rappahannock.—We give its dimensions as they existed prior to the separation of Rappahannock, and expecting to receive information of the extent of the latter by the time it comes to press, by reference to that county, the present extent of Culpeper may be ascertained. Length of the old county from the junction of Rapid Ann and Rappahannock to its northern angle in the Blue Ridge 42 miles,—mean breadth 16, and area 672 square miles; extending in lat. from 38° 15′ N. and long. from 0° 35′ to 1° 20′ W. of W. C.—We do not as yet know precisely to what lat. and long. the eastern boundary of Rappahannock extends. Besides its two boundary streams, Culpeper is watered by a number of creeks and rivers flowing N. E. into the Rappahannock, S. E. into the Rapid Ann; but the former being much longer, indicates the general slope of the county to be in that direction, the chief of them is Aestham river which rises in Madison and crosses Culpeper; and next in importance, Mountain creek, which rises near the Madison line, flows nearly parallel to Hazel, branch of Aestham river, and empties like it into the Rappahannock. The surface is finely diversified with hill and dale, and contains large bodies of excellent land; of the same general character which pervades the counties generally on the eastern foot of the Blue Ridge. Population in 1820, 20,942—1830, 24,027. Culpeper belongs to the 11th judicial circuit, and sixth district. Taxes paid in 1833, $3309 95—in 1834, on lots, $136 40—land, $1930 29—on 3222 slaves, $805 50—3119 horses, $187 14—9 studs, $122 00—43 coaches, $99 75—33 carryalls, $40 75—16 gigs, $9 10. Total $3330 94. Amount expended in educating poor children in 1832, $1012 93—in 1834, $735 01. Historical Sketch.—Culpeper county, at all times respectable, but chiefly distinguished in the revolutionary war, for the services of her Edward Stevens, her John Green, and her gallant Minute Men, who, as Mr. Randolph said, in one of his speeches in the United States Senate, "were raised in a minute, armed in a minute, marched in a minute, fought in a minute, and vanquished in a minute;"—was first created in 1748, out of a part of the county of Orange. Every thing therefore of a prior date which relates to the present county, must be sought either in Orange, or in Spottsylvania, from which Orange was taken in 1734, or in Essex, from which Spottsylvania was taken in 1720; or lastly, in the old county of Rappahannock, which was divided in 1692; and Essex and the county of Richmond made out of it; with a direction that the records belonging to the county court of Rappahannock, prior to that division, which was in fact an extinction of it, should be kept in Essex.—In 1793, Madison was taken from Culpeper, and in 1833, she was still further reduced in importance and extent by the act of assembly, which created a new county and revived in it the name of Rappahannock, with this difference, that it is now the soil from which that valuable stream derives its sources, instead of that through which it flowed in the full majesty of its accumulated strength. The boundaries of Culpeper, at the present time, are the same that formerly existed, except the dividing line between it and Rappahannock. That, unfortunately, is so described, that it is impossible to say with certainty, what it is. The act directs that the boundary line of Rappahannock shall begin "at the corner of Madison and Culpeper counties upon the top of the Blue Ridge of mountains, and run thence with the line of said counties to the point where it is intersected by Hugh's (Hughes's) river, above the junction of Hugh's (Hughes's) and Hazel rivers; thence with Hugh's (Hughes's) river to the junction of the aforesaid rivers, thence to a bend in the river near a point called the Giant's Castle; thence to Horner's mill upon the Fauquier and Culpeper line," and thence with the lines of the bordering counties to the beginning. Unluckily Hughes's river crosses the Madison line into what was formerly Culpeper, at the point which seems to be indicated by the foregoing description, in the natural construction of the words,—flows some distance, bends, and recrosses into Madison,—making a sort of insulated area between the river and the county line—and then some distance below crosses again into Culpeper, at a point still above the junction with the Hazel. In the natural construction of the language, Culpeper still retains jurisdiction over soil that is thus entirely detached from the body of the county, and which for convenience sake ought to belong to Rappahannock. The commissioners for running and marking the county line have performed their duty fully, as it seems to us, and yet have not touched this question; which will perhaps occasion some difficulty, in various ways, unless the assembly shall interpose to make it clearly a part of the one or the other county. Culpeper, in its original shape, comprehended all "the debateable ground" between the Crown of England and Lord Fairfax, that lay on the eastern side of the Blue Ridge, and was formerly the subject of a very interesting controversy, that deserves still to be remembered for the explanation it affords of some things, which otherwise would be inexplicable. Charles the Second, while a fugitive from his kingdom, granted to Lord Hopton and others "all that entire tract of land, situated within the heads of the rivers Rappahannock and Quiriough or Potomac, the courses of the said rivers, as they are commonly called and known by the inhabitants and descriptions of those parts, and Chesapeake bay, together with the rivers themselves, and all the islands within the banks of them," and on the 8th of May, 1669, after his restoration, and after that patent had been surrendered, "in order that he might regrant the lands with alterations,"—again granted the same tract of country to the Earl of St. Albans and others— These afterwards sold their right to Lord Culpeper; and James the Second, in the fourth year of his reign, but after he had in fact ceased to reign, confirmed the patents, and granted the same tract to the Lord Culpeper, his heirs and assigns, forever. Such was the origin of the proprietary title to the Northern Neck of Virginia:—but if any doubt as to its validity could have existed, it was entirely removed, not only by universal acquiescence during the colonial government, but by solemn decisions of the highest judicial tribunal in the commonwealth after the establishment of an independent government here. From Lord Culpeper this magnificent estate descended to his heir, Lord Fairfax; who (or his descendant, with the same title of nobility) afterwards removed to Virginia, and made it his residence. As the proprietors of the Northern Neck thus owned, the land lying between the Rappahannock, from its head to the bay, on the one side, and the Potomac, from its head to the bay on the other,—and the Crown retained its title to all the lands not included within those limits or otherwise granted away, —it was perfectly clear, in the first settlements,—which commenced on the seaboard,—to whom the settlers were to apply for a title to their lands. Below the falls, the Rappahannock was a well defined natural boundary: and as the land happened to lie on the north or the south side of it, the title was to be derived from the Proprietary or the Crown. But where the settlements upon that river extended towards the mountains, it was discovered that it was formed by the confluence, a short distance above the falls, and at the point which is now the extremity of Culpeper county towards the sea, —of two streams so nearly equal in magnitude, that it might well be doubted which of them led to the "head" of the Rappahannock. The one formed of several tributaries that might well dispute among themselves the honor of being the main branch of that arm of the river, has its source at Chester's Gap in the Blue Ridge, and in its whole course from thence to the point of the Great Fork of the Rappahannock, (as it is called to distinguish it from the Little Fork, formed above by the junction of this stream with Aestham's river,) separates the present counties of Fauquier, and (to a very small extent) Stafford, on the north, from Rappahannock and Culpeper on the south. The other, formed in like manner, has its source at that point in the Blue Ridge where the four counties of Orange, Madison, Rockingham and Shenandoah meet; and in its whole course from thence to its confluence with the former, it separates the present counties of Orange, and (to a very small extent) Spottsylvania on the south, from Madison and Culpeper on the north. If the latter were the main branch of the Rappahannock, and consequently the boundary of the proprietary tract,—grants of all the lands lying in what—from 1748 to 1793—was Culpeper co, (and now makes the three counties of Culpeper, Madison and Rappahannock,) were to be obtained from the proprietors of the Northern Neck: if the former, then from the Crown. And by drawing one line on the map of the state, from Fairfax's store, at the head of the North Branch of the Potomac, on the Back Bone of the Alleghany mountains, between the counties of Hardy and Randolph, to the former,—and another from the same point to the latter, (head of the Rappahannock,) it will be found that the title depended upon the same considerations, to a larger tract of country on the western side of the Blue Ridge, than even these three counties on the eastern. As early as the year 1705, upon the presentation of a patent for lands lying within the limits of this debateable ground,—to be signed by the proper agents of the royal government in this colony,—the agent for the proprietor of the Northern Neck objected to it—and thereupon an order of council was made, that neither the Crown or the proprietor should issue patents for such lands, until the dispute should be settled, and that commissioners mutually chosen should view the two branches of the Rappahannock, which we have before described. They were accordingly chosen, and reported that the streams appeared to be of equal magnitude:—and some other persons (styling themselves Wood's trustees,) by the request of the proprietor's agent, certified the same thing. After this the colonial government seems to have treated the territory on the south side of the North Fork of the Rappahannock, rising at Chester's Gap, as belonging to the Crown:—for in 1720, an act of assembly was passed, creating the county of Spottsylvania, which, in declaring its boundaries, directed a line to be run over the high mountains to the river on the north west side thereof, thence down the said river until it comes against the head of Rappa- hannock, thence to the head of Rappahannock river; and down that river to the mouth of Snow Creek. And in 1734, an act was passed for dividing Spottsylvania, which directed that all that territory of land adjoining to and above the dividing line thereby established, bounded S. by the line of Hanover county, (as it was then called,) northerly by the grant of the Lord Fairfax, and westerly by the utmost limits of Virginia, should be "thenceforth created into one distinct county, and be called and known by the name of the county of Orange. In 1748, an act was passed for dividing the county of Orange, which created the county of Culpeper,— and until the creation of Rappahannock in 1833, Culpeper always extended to that North Fork and to Chester's Gap, and in fact, in tracing the titles to land in the old county of Culpeper, it is found, that the patent, during this period, was usually granted in the name of the King—sometimes in the name of Lord Fairfax. In 1733 that lord obtained from the King instructions to the colonial government to appoint commissioners to settle the dispute about the boundaries, and to issue no more patents for lands lying within the contested districts, until the dispute was ended; but these instructions were not communicated to the governor and council until 1730. In that year Lord Fairfax arrived in the colony with the instructions; and in the course of that and the succeeding year, a survey, in pursuance of them, was made of the Northern Neck, by the commissioners, who, differing in opinion, made separate reports; which, in 1733, were referred to the committee of the council (in England) for plantation affairs, upon whose report, the King, on the 11th of April 1745, determined that all the lands contained between the head springs of the Potomac and the south branch of the Rappahannock, as we have before described it,) and the mouths of the 2 rivers, belonged to Lord Fairfax. In the meantime the commissioners had made their reports to the colonial government, which, from the alarm thereby occasioned to the holders of lands within the unsettled limits, who had derived their titles from the Crown, produced remonstrances and counter petitions before the governor and council:—and they confirmed the survey and report, that were most favourable to Lord Fairfax, upon the terms, that he should establish all the grants that had been made by the Crown; to which effect an order was made by the Lord on the 21st of December 1738. The royal order in council, already mentioned, also recited that Lord Fairfax had consented, and indeed proposed, "that all the grantees of lands under the Crown within the boundaries aforementioned, should quietly enjoy their lands according to their respective grants, and likewise to do and consent to all such acts as should be thought necessary to confirm and decree such grantees in the quiet possession of their said lands; and thereupon directed that the colonial government should not make any grants of lands within the said boundaries, or molest or disturb Lord Fairfax in the quiet possession and enjoyment of the lands contained therein; provided the said lands should be subject to the grants made of any parts thereof by his majesty, or any of his royal predecessors, and that the Lord Fairfax should comply with his proposal before mentioned. And in 1748, an act of assembly was passed which gave the form, and sanction and validity of law to this compromise, as it might properly be called,—establishing the head spring of Rappahannock, commonly called Conway, as the proprietor's southern boundary, and confirming the titles of grantees from the Crown. At the same session the whole of the land, on the eastern side of the Blue Ridge, which had been the subject of this important and protracted controversy, was created into a separate and distinct county; and it was named after Lord Culpeper, the ancestor of the then present proprietor. At the C. H. of the county a town was established by an act passed in 1759, which was called after the proprietor of the county himself, Fairfax, and has continued ever since to be the seat of justice for the county, by the same name. It was recently, by an act passed in 1834, incorporated; and at this time contains a C. H., jail, and clerk's office, on the public square, all handsome buildings, an episcopalian and a presbyterian church built of brick, and a masonic hall built of wood, with a large wooden meeting house in the immediate vicinity, belonging to the Baptist denomination — its streets are broad and laid out in a rectangular form, and are well supplied with pumps. There are 3 taverns, besides some boarding houses, 9 stores; 1 watch maker and jeweller's shop, 2 saddlers, 4 shoe makers, 4 tailors, and mantuamakers, 1 hatter, 3 blacksmiths, 2 carpenters and cabinet makers, 1 considerable establishment for making wagons, &amp;c. and another quite extensive for making coaches, carriages, &amp;c. The Piedmont line of post coaches, passes through this place. It contains also 7 lawyer's offices, 3 doctor's shops, and a parsonage house, which the vestry of the Episcopal church have purchased, and the ladies have nearly paid for, by that ingenious method of making much out of little, which has been latterly practised with such general success—a fair. There are in the immediate vicinity of the town 3 schools, all on private foundations, and 1 market house, also on private foundation.—2 respectable tanyards are kept up in sight of the town. There is a printing establishment, from which issues a weekly paper, under the title of the Culpeper Gazette; and another very recently established, that sends forth weekly, The Messenger.

Cumberland was created by the House of Burgess's in 1748, from a part of Goochland. It is bounded N. by James river, which separates it from Fluvanna, and Goochland, E. by Powhatan, S. E. and S. by the Appomattox which separates it from Amelia, and Prince Edward, and W. by Buckingham. Length 32 ms., mean breadth 10, and area 323 sq. ms. extendingin lat. from 37° 12′ to 37° 39′ N. and long. from 1° 13′ to 1° 40′ W. of W. C. The slope of this county is N. E., and the central part is drained by Willis's river, which empties into the James, a few miles above Cartersville. This stream is navigable by boats to Curdsville, a small town in Buckingham: (See Buckingham). This county is also watered by 4 creeks, which rise in the upper part within 3 or 4 miles of each other, near Rains' tavern. Bear branch empties into Willis's river. Great Guinea after running about 20 miles in the county empties into the Appomattox. Angle creek about 12 miles long, and Green creek, about 3; both of which afford much fertile bottom lands;—and Little Gunea, all flow into the Appomattox. The Appomattox waters, and bounds the southern part of the county from Powhatan to Buckingham, about 30 miles, and the James river on the north, by making a considerable bend, bounds and waters about the same distance. The surface is undulating, and the soil productive. The staples are indian corn, wheat and tobacco. The latter has been considered the principal article, but of late the farmers have turned their attention more to the cultivation of wheat; by which the lands have much improved, and the improvement is still progressing. Iron and coal have recently been discovered, on the Appomattox, near Farmville. The prevailing religious sects, are Presbyterians, Baptists, and Methodists.—there are 10 houses of public worship, and 4 resident ministers.—there are 4 flour manufacturing, and a number of grist mills in the county. Population 1820, 11,023—1830, 11,690. Cumberland belongs to the 8th judicial circuit, and 4th district.

W. of R., and 148 from W., situated 45 ms. E. N. E. of Lynchburg, on the N. side of Willis's river, 5 ms. W. of Cumberland C. H., 16 N. E. of Farmville, and 18 ms. from Buckingham C.H. surrounded by a fertile country. Willis's river is navigable to Curdsville, in Buckingham, 12 ms. above this place, and 60 ms. from its mouth. Ca Ira contains about 40 dwelling houses, 3 mercantile stores—selling $40 000 worth of goods annually, a merchant mill, which grinds from 28 to 30,000 bushels of wheat in the grinding season, a tobacco warehouse, at which from 3 to 500 hogsheads of tobacco are annually received, a house of worship free for all denominations, 2 taverns, and a masonic hall.—there are also among the mechanics, 2 tailors, 2 wheelwrights, 2 blacksmiths, and 2 plough manufacturers. This village was until lately unhealthy, and nearly depulated upon two different occasion: this was attributed to the pond attached to the manufacturing mill, which covered 200 acres of ground, and nearly surrounded the village, and produced very severe bilious attacks. The dam has now been removed 2 ms. up the stream, and the water brought down by a navigable canal: the old pond has been filled up, and its site 21 cultivated, which yields immense crops to the owners; and health is restored to the village. Population 210 Three mails a week are received. Cartersville, P. V. on the right bank of James river, 47 ms. W. of R. and 122 from W., situated in a fertile and healthy country. It contains 50 dwelling houses, 1 house of worship free for all denominations, a common school, a merchant mill, which grinds from 20 to 30,000 bushels of wheat annually, 5 mercantile stores, 3 groceries, 2 builders of thrashing machines, 2 tanyards, 1 saddler and many other mechanics, such as wheelwrights, plough makers, blacksmiths, shoe makers, &amp;c.

The soil is susceptible of high improvement. The water power is sufficient for machinery of any extent. Population 90 persons; 1 of whom is a physician. DINWIDDIE. Dinwiddie was created by the Legislature in 1752, from a part of Prince George. It is bounded E. by Prince George,—S. E. by Sussex,— S. by Nottoway river, which separates it from Brunswick,—W. by Nottoway,—and N. W. by Amelia. Dinwiddie is in form a hexagon, with a diameter of about 28 miles;—area about 616 sq miles. It is divided nearly into equal parts by the parallel of 37° N. lat.—its long. lies between 0° 33′ and 1° 3′ W. of W. C. The northern part of the county, about one-fourth of the whole, slopes north and is drained by the Appomattox. The remainder inclines S. E. is drained by Monks Creek, Stoney, Sapony, and other tributaries of Nottoway river.—The surface is undulating.—Population in 1820, 13,792—in 1830, 21,801. Dinwiddie belongs to the second judicial circuit, and first district. Taxes paid in 1833, $6538, 50—in 1834, on lots, $2736 59—land, $1863 68—5962 slaves, $1496 50—2673 horses, $160 38—7 studs, $258 00—134 coaches, $348 25—49 carryalls, $49 55—233 gigs, $135 83. Total, $7042 78. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $412 94; in 1833, $217 68. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. DINWIDDIE C. H. &amp; P. O. situated on Stoney Creek, 15 ms. S.

Judge May holds his Superior Court of Law and Chancery on 1st April and September. Goodwynsville, P. O. 47 m's. S. S. W. of R. and 169 from W. Harrisville, or Wyoming, 54 m's S. of R. and 176 from W., situated in the S. E. corner of the county, near Nottoway river, on the main southern stage road. It contains a mercantile store, blacksmith shop, and wheelwright. In the vicinity there are 2 extensive manufacturing mills; and the surrounding country is very thickly settled. PETERSBURG, Port of Entry, and P. O. 22 miles S. of R. and 144 S. S. W. of W. lat. 37° 13′ and long. 24° W. of W. C.: situated on the right or southern bank of Appomattox river—12 ms. above its junction with James river in the northern angle of the county, where it joins Prince George and Chesterfield; so that a part of the town is in each of those counties. This depot is well situated to sustain a high commercial rank amongst the ports of Virginia. The harbor admits vessels of considerable draught, and the adjacent country is well peopled and cultivated. The falls of Appomattox near which the city stands, affords an illimitable water power, whilst a canal obviates the impediment to navigation. Previous to the year 1815 the buildings were nearly all of wood, but in the summer of that year nearly all those situated on the most commercial streets were consumed by fire. Since that event the town has been rebuilt with neat and substantial brick houses and, in value as well as appearance, is very much improved. The number of houses besides the county buildings, which are handsome, may be estimated at about 800. There are 7 houses of public worship, belonging to Episcopalians, Methodists, Baptists and Presbyterians,—a Masonic Hall, female orphan asylum, several common schools and one free school; the latter is on the Lancasterian plan and was endowed principally by a legacy left to the town, for that purpose by a benevolent individual, (David Anderson,) and is called the "Anderson Seminary." There are six tobacco factories, six manufacturing flour mills, 1 brass and cast-iron foundry, 2 earthen-ware potteries, 2 cotton-seed-oil mills, numerous mercantile stores, and 4 druggist shops. The principal mechanical pursuits are—2 printing offices, by which 2 weekly papers are issued, and considerable book-work-printing done, 4 carriage manufacturies, 5 wheelwrights, 4 cabinet makers, 3 jersey wagon makers, 3 brick molders, 1 stone cutter and mill stone maker, 2 tanneries, 5 saddlers, 15 blacksmiths, 4 coppersmiths and tinplate workers, 3 jewellers and watch makers, and many house carpenters, tailors, hatters, milleners, and mantua makers. Petersburg is now rapidly increasing in business in consequence of its Rail Road, to the Roanoke river, which is about sixty miles long, and affords an opening by which large quantities of produce are brought to this market from the upper Roanoke and from the interior of North Carolina, and by which goods are with much facility returned in exchange, as the cars run daily to the Roanoke and back again. The grade of the road, with the exception of two or three planes, with an ascent of twenty-seven or thirty feet per mile, is very favorable to the use of the locomotive engine; and their success with this kind of power has not been surpassed in the country. They have now three engines upon the road, a part of which have been at work upwards of nine months, and made their trips with as much regularity as could have been expected from horse power. One of those, the "Liverpool," is probably, for her weight, the most effective engine of the country. This, and one of the other engines on this road, were constructed by M. Burry, of Liverpool, who has also furnished two engines for one of the Schuylkill rail roads, which we are informed work equally well. The proprietors of this road consider it as part of the great line of communication from north to south, and look to its ultimate connexion with the Charleston rail road, by similar works through North Carolina. Another channel by which much produce is brought to this market, is the Upper Appomottox Canal,—through which there is a constantly increasing trade. To this market there have been brought in one year 40,000 bales of cotton, 5,000 hogsheads of tobacco, and more than 100,000 bushels of wheat, besides many other articles. Petersburg is also much indebted for her prosperity to her cotton factories; of which at present, there are three—The first established was that of the Petersburg Manufacturing Company, in the year 1828. This factory commenced spinning in the fall of that year with 500 spindles, and the number was gradually increased, until it now runs 2500, which daily spin about 1200 pounds of yarn, or three hundred and sixty thousand pounds per annum. This yarn is made of the best cotton brought to the market, and the most of it is sold in yarn itself without further manufacture; some part of it is woven at the factory into a heavy cotton cloth called "oznaburgs," and is stamped "Virginia cloth," in consequence of the likeness between this and the cotton cloth formerly so well known in this state by that name. This factory gives employment to none but white persons, and has constantly employed about 110 operatives, who are mostly young girls, of good character and industrious habits, who receive in weekly wages about thirteen thousand dollars per annum.—The Merchants' Manufacturing Company has two factories, one of which is on a small scale, and has for some years been in operation, the other recently erected, has but lately begun to spin; it has a commodious house well planned, and runs 3500 spindles and a number of looms capable of weaving from 1500 to 2000 yards of cotton cloth per day and employs about 200 operatives. It is in contemplation to erect, ere long, two other cotton factories, on a large scale, and as the water power here is great, the raw material plenty, and operatives readily procured, it is probable that at no distant day, Petersburg will be a considerable manufacturing town. —From the town, a considerable foreign trade is carried on with England, France, Holland, and Germany, and goods of all descriptions are here plenty and cheap. Large ships load at City Point. The navigation from City Point to this place until lately was bad, affording not more than four feet water—but within a few years works have been completed on the river, which have deepened it to about seven feet.—At one time this town was considered unhealthy, but by draining and filling up marshes, and by other improvements, it has now become as salubrious as any part of lower Virginia; and has the character of being hospitable and patriotic; and a very delightful place of residence. The Bank of Virginia and Farmers' Bank of Virginia have each a branch at this place. It possesses also an insurance office, and custom house. Population 1830, 8,322. Corporation courts are held on the third Monday in every month; Quarterly in March, May, August and November. Judge May holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the first of April and September. Poplar Grove, P. O. 39 ms. S. of R. and 161 from W. Richieville, P.O. 62 ms.

Elizabeth City was one of the eight original shires into which Virginia was divided in 1634.—It is bounded E. by the Chesapeake, S. by Hampton Roads, N. by Back river, which separates it from York, and W. by Warwick.—Its form is nearly that of a square, about 18 miles on each side;—area 64 square miles. It extends from 37° 02′ to 37° 08′ N. lat. and from 0° 37′ to 0° 47′ E. of W. C. Population, 1820, 3,789—1830, 5,053.—It belongs to the 3d judicial circuit, and 2nd district. Taxes paid in 1833, $794 24—in 1834, on lots, $184 62—on land, $316 63—912 slaves, $228 00—408 horses, $24 43—3 studs, $71 00—7 coaches, $16 00—49 carryalls, $49 55—233 gigs, $135 83. Total, $7042 78. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $45 39—in 1834, no report. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. HAMPTON, P. V. and county seat, 96 ms. from R. and 199 S. E. of W. Hampton is a sea port, situated on Hampton Roads, 2½ miles from Fortress Monroe, 18 from Norfolk, 24 from York Town, and 36 from Williamsburg.—It contains about 130 houses; 2 Methodist, 1 Baptist, and 1 Episcopalian meeting house, 1 Academy and 1 private school, 6 dry good stores, 10 grocery stores, 2 taverns, 3 castor oil manufactories, (2 in town and 1 adjacent.). The principal mechanical pursuits are, shoe making, blacksmiths' work, house-carpentry, and ship-building. Hampton has for some time been declining:—There is no commerce or inland trade to support it. Hampton is the place of residence for nearly all the pilots for James river, and the neighborhood of Norfolk; and when trade was brisk, they circulated nearly all the proceeds of their labor in their own town; but the Fortifications at Old Point Comfort, and the Rip Raps, have been for some time past the principal source of revenue to the inhabitants both of the town and county, by the wages given for negro laborers. Hampton is as healthy as any town in lower Virginia. Population in 1830, 1120.— There are 2 attorneys, and 4 physicians. County Courts are held on the 4th Thursday in every month;—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Upshur holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 24th of April and 19th of September. Old Point Comfort, or Fortress Monroe, cape and P. O. 12 ms. in a direct line a little W. of N. Norfolk, 3 ms. S. E. of Hampton, the county seat, and 202 ms. S. S. E. of W. C. The promontory, particularly called Old Point Comfort, is almost exactly on lat 37°, and with the opposing point, Willioughby, on the right shore, forms the real mouth of James river, the intervening strait separating Lynhaven bay from Hampton Roads. The channel which leads in from the Capes of Virginia to Hampton Roads, is, at Old Point Comfort, reduced to a very narrow line. The shoal water, which, under the action of the sea, and reacted upon by the bar, is kept in an unremitting ripple, has given the name of Rip Raps to this place. When the bar is passed, Hampton Roads, which extend to Norfolk, about eighteen miles distant, into which James river, Elizabeth river, and Nansemond Mouth empty, afford the finest anchorange in the world, and in them its navies might ride with perfect safety. With a view of making this a secure retreat for ships of war and for our commerce, in any future contest with a naval power, Fort Monroe was built on the point, on the right side of the channel at the entrance of the Roads—and the castle of the Rip Raps is directly opposite the point, at the distance of about 1900 yards. The two forts will completely command the channel, and it will be impossible for a single ship of war to pass without the permission of the power holding the fortresses. They are so constructed as to present immense batteries of cannon upon an approaching ship, from the moment she comes in reach, from the Capes, and throughout all the bendings of the channel it must still be under the power of the cannon: for the forts present a new aspect at every turn, and in all probability the interdicted ship would be a wreck, or a conflagration, from the hot shot thrown into her, before she completed half the circuit of the channel. There is much salutary experience, bought however dearly, in the lessons of the late war. These waters were then the resort of the British fleets, and while all American vessels were either driven from their own harbors, or captured, the enemy made himself at home here—sent detachments to Baltimore and Washington—ravaged the shores of the Chesapeake—burnt our Capitol and Navy Yards, and laid the whole country under contribution. The erection of the two Forts at this central point of our seaboard, gives us a refuge to our naval force, if driven in by superior numbers, and will, in effect, not only occlude Hampton Roads to the enemy, and shut him out from James river and Norfolk, our naval depot, but must deter him ever venturing up the Chesapeake bay. If such an attempt were made, the first calm would put the most powerful fleet of an enemy completely at the mercy of a few steam frigates or steam batteries, which, by means of their self-moving power, would be enabled to take such position as suited them, and to set fire to the ships of the enemy with hot shot, or cut them off in detail. The shelter of these forts, too, would enable a few ships, lying in security under their guns, to sally out and take advantage of any storm which might separate a blockading force, exposed to the accidents of an open sea. These circumstances give great importance to the works which are to form the gates at Hampton Roads— and, as a consequence, in a great degree to the whole Chesapeake bay. Fort Monroe is already finished, and is at this moment in admirable condition, if its armaments were completed. The Rip Raps structure, is a monument, worthy of the people who have lavished their means in its erection, and of the genius of the engineers by whom it was planned. The area of the structure, as originally staked off includes five acres; a great part of which was 22 feet below the surface of the sea, and that nearest the surface 18 feet. To get a foundation above water for the Fort or Castle, an Island has been raised, by throwing rocks into the water, until, by gradual accumulation, it has emerged above the tides. The rock of which this Island is formed, has been brought from great distances, and at a vast expense. After a foundation was obtained for the Castle above high water, the building of the Castle was begun, and carried up so as to form the first embrasures. It was found that the settling of the artificial mound of stone cracked the walls. The building was, therefore, discontinued; but immense masses of granite have since been brought and lodged upon the lines of the work, that the weight of the material, might be employed in consolidating its foundations. For some years this marine pyramid sunk between six and eight inches; during the last year but one, although pressed with the weight of all the material gathered for the superstructure, it settled about three inches. The present aspect of the place is rough and savage, and when the surge rushes in among the hollow piles of granite, and the wind whistles among the naked spars, which are planted round the walls for the support of the scaffolding, the music of the surrounding elements of sea and air, is quite in keeping with the dreary, desolate spot, which, at a distance, looks like a Gibralter, beaten down by cannonade, and fallen prostrate in the sea. Nothing could add more to the grandeur, of what has been justly called the American Mediterranean, than the elevation of the Castle at Rip Raps—the rising of this giant of the flood, from the waves, as contemplated by Commodore Warrenton, Commodore Elliot, General Armistead, General Bernard, General Swift and Major McRee, the commissioners and engineers, in whose design the work originated. The ancients tell us that Venus rose from the sea, but it would seem a much fitter element, to give birth to the god of war; and never was there a nobler scene, or nobler temple, than that appropriated for his cradle, by the American people at the Rip Raps. He will appear here, not like the goddess of love, borne in a shell upon a summer's sea, but upon a tower of strength amidst the noise of restless surges,—a fit emblem of the American people, whose martial strength belongs alike to the land and to the ocean. It is a circumstance worth notice, that the material for the structure of the Castle of the Rip Raps is drawn from most of the commercial states of the Union. In walking over the piles you behold the dark grey granite of Maine—the whitish blue and the black speckled granite of Connecticut—the red free stone of the same state—the pied granite of the Susquehannah— the deep blue of the Little Falls of Potomac—and the ash colored of the James river. In this edifice, which is to form a strong hold in a central position—defend our great naval depot, and to protect our naval power over the ocean; and especially to afford a place of refuge to the commerce of the nation, each commercial state may point to a portion of the blended strength which it has contributed to the common structure. The castle, at the Rip Raps, should then be called, as well from its use, as from its origin, the Castle of the Federal Union—and when attacked by foreign or domestic assailants, it should run up with the ensign of "the Federal Union," the watch word "it must be preserved." ESSEX. Essex was created by the Legislature in 1692, from a part of (Old) Rappahannock Co. It is bounded E. by the Rappahannock river, which separates it from Richmond,—S. E. by Middlesex,—S. and S.

TAPPAHANNOCK, P. V. and seat of justice; situated on the right bank of the Rappahannock, 50 miles N. E. of R. and 109 S. E. of W. lat. 37° 58′ N.; long 11° 10′ E. W. C. The situation is low and flat, but as there is not much marsh land in the neighborhood, it is not very sickly. It was formerly a place of considerable trade, as large vessels can ascend some distance above it, but like most of the villages on tide water in Virginia it is not increasing, because the business formerly transacted by them directly with foreign countries, is now transacted through the medium of the cities. It is about 50 miles from the open Chesapeake bay. It contains 29 dwelling houses, 4 mercantile stores, 2 druggists, one house of worship free for all denominations, 2 hotels, a female seminary of the first order, which has been established 15 years, and received an unusual share of public favor; in this all the usual female accomplishments are taught, whilst every attention is paid to the moral and religious duties of the pupils, by the pious and accomplished lady who presides over the establishment.—The mechanics are, a jeweller, milliner and mantua maker, 2 tailors, a saddle and harness maker, a coach maker, and 2 boot and shoe makers.—There is a Ferry across the Rappahannock at this point. Population 1830, 280. Three attorneys, and five physicians reside here. County courts are held on the third Monday in every month: Quarterly in March, May, August and November. Judge Brown holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery, on the 4th of May and October. FAIRFAX. Fairfax was created by the Legislature in 1742, from a part of Prince William.

This village is situated on the Fauquier, and Alexandria turnpike road, about 6 ms. from the line dividing the counties of Loudoun, and Prince William. It derives its name from its central position, being about equi-distant from Leesburg, Middleburg, Warrenton, Washington, Georgetown and Alexandria. Its situation is elevated and highly picturesque, affording one of the best mountain prospects in the state of Virginia. It has always been remarkable for the salubrity of its air, and the health of its inhabitants. It contains 30 dwelling houses, 1 Methodist meeting house, 2 taverns, 3 mercantile stores, 1 common school, and a well organized Sunday school. The mechanics are 2 tanners, 1 saddler, 4 boot and shoe manufacturers, 1 wheel wright, 2 blacksmiths, 1 cabinet maker, 2 house carpenters, and 1 tailor. For some time past this village has been declining; but the spirit of industry and enterprize at present manifested by its inhabitants, justifies the hope of a more favourable state of things.

The house contains on the ground floor, 6 rooms and a spacious passage, 4 of these are of ordinary size at the north east is a large room, very lofty, with a handsomely sculptured ceiling, which contains a very handsome marble mantle-piece sent to General Washington from Italy,—also a very fine organ, on which instrument the late Mrs. Washington was an accomplished performer, this room is only used for large dinner parties, &amp;c. The room, at the south east end of the house, is used as a family dining room, and contains busts of Monsieur Neckar, Paul Jones, and General Washington,—also a handsome library, fitted in the wall, with glass cases; the books chiefly collected by General Washington. The house fronts N. W., the rear looking to the river. In front of the house is a lawn, containing 5 or 6 acres of ground, with a serpentine walk around it, fringed with shrubbery, and planted with poplar. On each side of the lawn stands a garden: the one on the right is the flower garden, and contains two green houses, (one built by Gen. Washington, the other by Judge Washington,) a hot house, and a pinery. It is laid off in handsome walks, with box-wood borders, remarkable for their beauty. It contains, also, a quantity of fig trees producing excellent fruit—the other is a kitchen garden, containing only fruit and vegetables. About 200 yards from the house, in a southerly direction, stands a summer house, on the edge of the river bank, which is lofty and sloping, and clothed with wood to the water's edge. The summer house commands a fine prospect of the river, and the Maryland shore,—also of the White House at a distance of 5 or 6 ms. down the river, where an engagement took place during the late war, with the British vessels which ascended the river. Proceeding from the summer house about 150 yards, in a westerly direction, you come to the vault—a plain excavation in the bank, faced with brick, and surrounded with a rough white-washed paling. Several lofty oaks stand around it, and small red cedar trees grow on the top of the tomb. The door and door posts are covered with names of visitors. In the vault are buried General Washington and his WIFE, Judge Washington and his wife, with many relations of the family. The estate, as owned by Judge Washington, consisted of between 3 and 4000 acres, now divided between the Judge's nephews. John Augustine Washington, owns Mount Vernon with the grounds immediately around the house, and 1200 acres of land. The fallow deer abound in the woods. The timber of which is composed chiefly of white and black oak, with dogwood, hickory, ash, cedar, &amp;c., the soil is thin, and rather poor, cultivated chiefly in Indian corn, rye, barley, &amp;c. Judge Washington cultivated the millet to a considerable extent,—he kept many sheep, and found them profitable. There are 2 fisheries on the place, where shad and herring are caught in large quantities. Mount Vernon is healthy during all the year except the fall, when agues and bilious fevers prevail. An intelligent visiter, connected with the public press, some years since gave to the world an interesting sketch of a visit to Mount Vernon, he remarks, "we were conducted over long gravel walks, bordered with box, which is arranged and trimmed into the most fanciful figures, and which at the age of 20 years and upwards, still possesses the vigour and freshness of youth. At the extremity of these extensive alleys and pleasure grounds, ornamented with fruit trees and shrubbery, and clothed in perennial verdure, stands two hot houses, and as many green houses, situated in the sunniest part of the garden, and shielded from the northern winds by a long range of wooden buildings, for the accommodation of servants. From the air of a frosty December morning, we were suddenly introduced into the tropical climate of these spacious houses, where we long sauntered among groves of the coffee tree, lemons and oranges, all in full bearing, regailing our senses with the flowers and odours of spring." "One of the hot houses is appropriated entirely to rearing the pine apple which grows in great perfection, long rows of which we saw in a flourishing and luxuriant condition. A stalk produces but a single apple, which grows near the ground, in the centre of a cluster of tall and spear-shaped leaves. Many bushels of lemons and oranges of every variety are annually grown, which besides furnishing the family with a supply of these fruits at all seasons, are distributed as a delicacy to their friends, or used to administer to the comforts of their neighbours in cases of sickness. The coffee plant thrives well, yields abundantly, and in quality is said to be equal to the best Mocha. The branches under which we walked were laden with the fruit, fast advancing to maturity. Among the more rare plants we saw the night blooming cereus, the guava, from which the jelly of that name is made, alloes of a gigantic growth, the West India plantain, the sweet cassia in bloom, the prickley pear, and a thousand others. They are all tastefully arranged in large boxes made for the purpose, and nurtured with unceasing attention, requiring the constant services of two assistants besides the chief gardener. To the north of the range of buildings before mentioned, is an extensive kitchen garden, surrounded with a hedge of cedar, so regularly trimmed, as to present the appearance of a verdant wall. At every step in these pleasure grounds, the thought occurred that the illustrious projector is no more. "There was a garden, and in the garden, a new sepulchre," says the Scripture. The lesson on human pursuits and human pleasures, inculcated by this concise and beautiful narration of the Evangelist, never struck me more forcibly than when we left the gate, and walked towards the tomb of Washington. In passing the house, the chamber in which he died was pointed out to us; and imagination aided by these memorials, soon presented the whole scene in such distinct and vivid colors that we seemed almost to follow his remains to the grave. The family vault in which the dust of the hero reposes, is at the distance of perhaps 30 rods from the house immediately upon the bank of the river. A more romantic and picturesque site for a tomb can scarcely be imagined. Between it and the Potomac, is a curtain of forest trees covering the steep declivity to the water's edge, breaking the glare of the prospect, and yet affording glimpes of the river, when the foliage is the thickest. The tomb is surrounded by several large native oaks, which are venerable by their years, and which annually strew the sepulchre with autumnal leaves, furnishing the most appropriate drapery for such a place, and giving a still deeper impression to the memento mori. Interspersed among the oaks, and over hanging the tomb, is a copse of red cedar, but whether native or transplanted, I could not ascertain, its ever-green boughs presents a fine contrast to the hoary and leafless branches of the oak, and while the deciduous foliage of the latter indicates the decay of the body, the eternal verdure of the former furnishes a beautiful emblem of the immortal spirit. The sacred and symbolic cassia was familiar to Washington, and perhaps led to the selection of a spot where the ever green flourished." Pleasant Valley, P. V. 138 ms. from R., and 30 ms. W. of W., situated on Little river turnpike road, 10 ms. above Fairfax G. H. It contains 10 dwelling houses, a tavern, store, and blacksmith shop. Population 20. Prospect Hill, P. O. 132 ms. from R., and 9 W. of W. FAUQUIER. Fauquier was created by the legislature in 1759, from a part of Prince William. It is bounded N. by Loudoun, N. E. and E. by Prince William, E. and S. E. by Stafford, S. and S. W. by the Rappahannock, which separates it from Culpeper, and W. N. W. by the Blue Ridge, which separates it from Frederick:—greatest length 45 ms. mean breadth 16, and area 720 sq. ms.—It extends in lat from 38° 24′ to 39° 02,′ and in long from 0° 32,′ to 1° 5′ W. of W. C. This county possesses very valuable beds of magnesia, soap stone, and several gold mines, worked upon an extensive scale. The northern part of the county slopes north, and sends it waters to Goose creek; but from the neighbourhood of Cobler mountain, near Salem, a ridge runs to the S. E. extremity of the county, which divides its waters those on the N. E. side flowing N. E. into the Occoquan, and those on the S. W. flowing in a S. E. direction until they reach the Rappahannock. The surface is agreeably diversified, and the soil when judiciously cultivated, susceptible of high improvement, and very productive. Population 1820, 23,103—1830, 26,086. Fauquier belongs to the 6th judicial circuit, and 3rd district. Taxes paid in 1833, $7,282 69—in 1834, on lots, $293 42— land, $4,558 74—5,903 slaves, $1,475 75—7132 horses, $427 92—28 studs, $311 00—76 coaches, $191 50—52 carryalls, $62 26—35 gigs, $23 75. Total $7,344 28. No report of school commissioners. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Arnold's Old Place, P. O. 129 ms. from R., and 73 from W. Barnetts' Mills, P. O. 93 ms. from R., and 68 from W., situated on the north side of the Rappahannock river, about 6 ms. above its junction with the Rapid Ann. It contains 12 dwelling houses, a Presbyterian house of worship, a mercantile store, an extensive flour manufacturing mill, 40 feet square, and 5 stories high, which makes annually from 3 to 4000 barrels of flour, a grist, and a saw mill which saws from 2 to 300,000 feet of plank annually. The mechanical pursuits are various, such as millers, mill-wrights, coopers, boot and shoe makers, blacksmiths, &amp;c. Population 30. The Rappahannock is at this place 100 yards wide, and is now being made navigable for boats to Fredericksburg, by the Rappahannock Coripany. The navigation is to extend 50 ms. above Barnett's mills, and will greatly enhance the value of water power at this and other points on the river. The water power at this place is created by a dam 5 feet high, situated half a mile above the mills, and conveyed to them by a canal cut in some places through the solid rock, to the depth of 25 or 30 feet, the fall gained by the dam and canal is 16 feet. There has recently been erected at this place a stamping mill, for the purpose of stamping gold ores, obtained from a mine about half a mile distant, worked by a company. The ore of this mine is thought by experienced judges, to contain gold enough to afford a good profit upon the investment necessary to keep the mine in operation,—It is even said that ore yielding fifty cents a bushel, may be worked profitably—and picked ore from this mine has yielded $8 per bushel by actual assay. We learn also by a recent communication, that the miners in searching for gold have recently discovered a beautiful soapstone which has already become an article of commerce, and is likely to be very profitable, when the improve ments on the river shall have been completed sufficiently for its transportation. Blackwell's Mill, 116 ms. N. N. W. of R., and 60 ms. S. W. by W. of W., situated 6 ms. W. of Warrenton, 40 N. of Fredericksburg, and 50 ms. S. W. of Alexandria, on the east side of Carter's Run, about 2 ms. above its junction with the Rappahannock, on the main road leading from Warrenton to Chester's Gap: at the end of the progressing improvement of navigation, which, when complete will make the mill, the main deposit of all the grain raised west of it, as far as the Blue Ridge, a distance of 18 ms, of fine wheat growing country. This mill stands unrivalled in its section of country, for the immense amount of wheat which it purchases. It manufactures 30,000 bushels annually. There is also a good saw mill, with an abundance of pine timber at hand, 1 general store, and 10 dwelling houses. The country around is densely populated;—the soil susceptible of high improvement, especially by the use of clover and plaister. Population at the mill 30. Doddsville, P.

Lee's Sulphur Spring, on the Rappahannock, near Thompson's Falls, on the road from Warrenton to Jeffersonton, in Culpeper. This spring has been only known for a few years, but has become exceedingly popular, and attracts such a concourse in summer, as to have induced their enterprising proprietor (John Hancock Lee) to go to very great expense in erecting large, pleasant, and commodious buildings, and laying out the grounds with great beauty, taste, and variety of ornamental trees, &amp;c.

This the Rappahannock Company will evade by a canal which they have commenced on the Fauquier side.— Vast quantities of building stone of excellent quality, may be found on both sides of the river. FLUVANNA. Fluvanna was created by the Legislature in 1777, from a part of Albemarle county.—It is bounded N. by Louisa, W. by Albemarle, S. by James river, which separates it from Buckingham, and E. partly by Goochland, and partly by a bend of James river, separating it from Cumberland. It is in shape a parallelogram, approaching to a square, its border in common with Albemarlc is 26 miles, its mean breadth 16,—area 416 sq. miles. It extends in lat from 37° 40′ to 37° 58′ N. and in long, from 1° 12′ to 1° 43′ W. of W. C. The Rivanna river enters it from Albemarle, and flowing S. E. divides the county diagonally, leaving nearly half on the north side, and empties into James river at Columbia. The surface is for the most part broken, but between the Rivanna and James there is a large tract of barren, level land which runs for some distance into Albemarle. The soil on the rivers is good—that on the James equal perhaps to any of the celebrated low grounds on that river. The lower part of the county,—included in a line drawn from the mouth of little Bremo creek to the N. E. angle of the county—has a dark greyish soil resembling disintegrated granite which produces the best chewing tobacco in the state. An eminent tobacco manufacturer of Richmond has offered the inhabitants of this district to take all of their tobacco, (lugs included,) at $10 a hundred, and pay all costs and charges for its delivery in Richmond. The vein of gold which runs through Louisa, Goochland and Fluvanna into Buckingham, is worked near Palmyra, the county seat of Fluvanna.

W. by W. of R. and 122 from W., situated on the left bank of the Rivanna, on the post road, 25 miles from Columbia, and 16 from Charlottesville, in the midst of beautiful mountain and river scenery. At this place there are located, a merchant mill, grist and saw mill, and a cotton factory, called the Virginia Union Factory.— This factory owned by Messrs. Timberlake and Magrvder, is a large and commodious brick building; it runs 1500 spindles, besides the necessary machinery for carding, &amp;c.—it contains 12 power looms, in which several hundred yards of substantial cloth are made per day. The cotton yarn of this establishment is in high repute throughout the state. More than 100 operatives are employed by the enterprising proprietors in the different departments of their establishment.— The place contains comfortable houses for the accommodation of 18 or 20 families, a tanyard, and a methodist house of worship; besides the elegant dwellings of the proprietors. Wilmington, P. V. 55 ms. N. W. by W. of R. and 132 from W., situated on Rivanna river, 14 miles above its mouth. There are located here 2 taverns, 2 mercantile stores, and a blacksmith shop. Winn's Tavern, P. O. 68 ms. N. W. by W. of R. and 142 from W. in the western part of the county. FRANKLIN. Franklin was created by the Legislature in 1784, from parts of Bedford and Henry counties. It lies S. W. of Staunton river, and is bounded by the county of Botetourt on the N., Bedford on the N. E. and E., Pittsylvania on the S. E., Henry on the S., Patrick on the S. W., by the Blue 23 Ridge, separating it from Floyd on the W. and a small part of Montgomery and part of Botetourt on the N. W. Length 30 miles, mean breadth 25, and area 750 square miles. It contains in lat from 36° 46′ to 37° 13′ N. and in long. from 2° 41′ to 3° 18′ W. of W. C. Black Water river and Pig river rise in the Blue Ridge on the west, and run nearly parallel with each other through the county to the east. Black Water emptying itself into the Staunton at the junction of the Bedford, Pittsylvania and Franklin lines; and Pig river emptying itself in the same stream in the county of Pittsylvania.—Neither river is navigable. The streams called creeks are all small, though of sufficient size for the usual purposes of machinery. The principal of these are Snow creek, rising in the mountain and running east into Pig river—Maggotty, rising in the Blue Ridge, running to the east into Black Water—Chesnut creek, running to the east into Pig river—Gill's creek, rising in the Blue Ridge and running to the east into Black Water—Runnett Bag, rising in the Blue Ridge and running to the S. E. into Smith's river, in the county of Patrick, and Nicholas creek, running south into Smith's river. There are some small mountains—Chesnut mountain south of the court house about twelve miles, and the Grassy Hill, on the north, about a mile from the court house, are the largest. The others are small and deserve no particular notice. About half a mile east of this place an immense rock rises very abruptly, particularly on the north, at least two hundred feet above its base, from which the county town takes its name—it is known as the Bald Knob, from its barren surface of rock—whose area is about eighty feet in length, by a mean breadth of about fifteen. The Staunton or Roanoke river, from the point where it passes through the Blue Ridge, forms a natural boundary of the county, separating it from Bedford.—The Blue Ridge from the same point forms another natural boundary on the north, separating Franklin from Botetourt, until it loses itself in the Alleghany at the Bent mountain, which then forms the boundary separating Franklin from Montgomery and Floyd, until it reaches the Patrick line. The staples are principally tobacco, wheat, Indian corn and iron. The Washington Iron Works, on Pig river, within half a mile of Rocky Mount, yield annually about 150 tons of iron of a very superior quality. Iron ore is found in various parts of the county. The slope of the county is E. S. E. The elevation of the surface is about equal to that of the adjoining county of Bedford, or about 650 feet above the tide of the ocean. The general face of the country is rolling— the soil of a medium quality, with a clay foundation, and generally well adapted to farming. Population 1820, 12,017—in 1830, 14,911.—Franklin belongs to the tenth judicial circuit, and fifth district. Taxes paid in 1832-3 $2182 19—in 1833-4, on lots, $19 35—land, $1131 12—2612 slaves, $653 00—3459 horses, $207 54—14 studs, $146 00—8 coaches, $21 00—9 carryalls, $9 00—12 gigs, $7 35.

It is bounded, on the W. by Fluvanna, N. by Hanover and Louisa, E. by Henrico, and S. by James river, which separates it from Powhatan and Cumberland. It is 30 miles in length by about 10 in mean breadth, containing 300 sq. miles. It extends in lat. from 37° 31′ to 37° 51′ N. and in long from 0° 47′ to 1° 20′ W. of W. C. The general surface of the county is undulating, in some places rather broken. In diverging from the river it becomes more level and uniform, particularly in the upper part of the county. There is great diversity of soil, though much that is now exhausted and abandoned for all purposes of cultivation, was naturally of good and improvable quality. By far the finest portion of the county is that in the vicinity of James river. Perhaps there is no other tract of similar extent in eastern Virginia, that combines equal natural advantages with so much fertility of soil and beauty of scenery. The width of the low grounds which form the ravine of the river, and the bold features of the adjacent highlands, present a pleasing and striking contrast. Added to this, an improved system of husbandry has been generally adopted throughout this section within a few years, the good effects of which are decidedly manifest. But though the lands in the vicinity of the river are undoubtedly much finer than in other parts of the county, yet they are in many places of excellent quality, and easily susceptible of improvement. The chief products are corn, wheat, tobacco and oats. Wheat and tobacco are the staple commodities for market, though the extent to which the latter is cultivated has been much circumscribed of late years. Goochland is well watered, particularly in the lower part by good streams, which mostly empty into James river. On many of these, there is water power to a considerable extent, but none of it is employed for domestic manufactures. Saw and grist mills are numerous. Roads and Canals.—The most important local improvement in the county is the Tuckahoe canal, which was excavated about the year 1828. It was projected for the purpose of conveying the coal on Tuckahoe creek to Richmond, and is exclusively within the county. It communicates with the James river canal by means of a lock. Being constructed upon economical but efficient principles, the stock has proved to be exceedingly valuable. The only good road in the county, and one of the best between the Blue Ridge and Tide Water, is the main stage road leading by the court house, from Richmond to Charlottesville. A laudable pride is felt, to keep this highway in good repair. There are sections of other roads, preserved in good order; but generally speaking, the road laws are executed with very little attention to public convenience. The Three Chopped road is almost as much famed for its often impassable condition as the well known bog of the Choppawamsic. Minerals.—The mineral wealth of Goochland is considerable. Bituminous coal is found in great abundance in the lower or eastern part of the county, both on Tuckahoe creek and on James river. In the upper portion of the county, gold has been discovered in many places, from which some profit has been realised. Churches.—There are from 15 to 20 houses of public worship in the county, the greater part of which belong to the Baptists, who constitute the prevailing sect. The other religious societies are the Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians and Friends. Streams.—Tuckahoe creek, a stream of some size, forms in part the lower boundary of the county. In its vicinity, a few miles from James river, there is an extensive body of coal, of excellent quality. To facilitate the transportation of this mineral to market, the Tuckahoe canal was opened in 1828, to communicate with the James river improvement. The stock of this canal is probably the most valuable canal stock in Virginia, the dividend being 33 per cent per annum. On Tuckahoe creek and its branches there are many grist and saw mills, the latter of which furnish a great quantity of lumber for the Richmond market. The stream is about 15 or 20 miles in length, pursuing generally a S. E. course to its junction with James river. The country which it waters is of medium quality—some of it very good. Dover creek, about ten miles long, emptying into James river at Dover mills. Its general course is southerly. The soil on either side, after leaving the river for a mile or two, is of inferior quality, and not a little of it an entire waste. Genito creek empties into James river at Jude's ferry. At about two miles from the river it is divided into the eastern and western branches, on the former of which there is a saw mill, and on the latter two grist mills. The land along this stream is mostly of excellent quality. General course south, and about eight miles in length. Beaverdam creek, one of the principal streams in the county, empties into James river about five miles below the court house, after pursuing a very devious course. The principal branches of this stream, are the eastern and western forks, and Horsepen creek. It drains a considerable portion of country, much of which is distinguished for its fertility, and the durable qualities of the soil. The flats along the creek are generally wide, and yield great crops of Indian corn. The highland is remarkably well adapted to the growth of wheat. Though the land is rolling throughout the whole length of Beaverdam creek, there is not much water power, and of course very few mills on the stream. On the Horsepen, there is an excellent grist mill, and a saw mill. Little creek, a small stream entering into James river three miles above the court house. It is five or six miles long; general course to the south. Its passage is through a portion of beautiful country. Lickinghole creek is a considerable stream which discharges itself into James river four miles above the court house. It was formerly navigable for batteaux for two or three miles to a manufacturing mill, but its bed has now become so obstructed by hammocks, as to impede their progress, except for a short distance. It is divided into two branches, the larger and smaller, both of which pass through a country of tolerable fertility. There are but few mills on this stream. Length about 15 miles, pursuing a somewhat southeasterly direction to its entrance into the river. Byrd creek, the largest stream in the county, empties into James river about 7 miles below Columbia. It is divided into two branches, Big and Little Byrd, which unite near the mouth. The Big Byrd rises in Fluvanna, and flows a S. E. course, running through a hilly country, especially near its termination. The lands on this stream as well as the Little Byrd are generally thin, but abound in fine timber. There are several grist and saw mills. It is on the smaller branches of the Byrd that gold has been found. Islands.—Sabot island contains 500 acres, and is situated opposite to Dover mills. The soil is in a high degree fertile. Pleasant's islands, a short distance above Judes ferry, and three miles below Maiden's Adventure falls. The land is extremely fertile, and some of the original growth was Horse Chesnut, (Æsculus flava,) a very uncommon forest tree in Eastern Virginia. The two islands contain nearly 200 acres. Bolling's island, in Rock Castle neck, about ten miles above the court house, contains 500 acres, and possesses a soil of great fertility. Elk island, a few miles above Cartersville, contains 1000 acres, and is much celebrated for the strength and fertility of its soil, half of this island sold a few years since for the enormous price of $75,000. Ferries.—Manican town ferry, a few miles above Powell's. Judes ferry, at the mouth of Genito creek. Michaux' ferry, one mile below the court house. Population in 1820, 10,007—in 1830, 10,360. Goochland belongs to the 7th judicial circuit, and 4th district. Tax paid in 1832-3, $3358 09—in 1833-4, on land, $2228 36—3156 slaves, $789 00—2156 horses, $129 36—5 studs, $76 00—44 coaches, $113 50—30 carryalls, $35 80—63 gigs, $35 85—Total, $3407 87.

It is situated in a populous neighborhood, not far from Beaverdam creek, whence its name. It is surrounded mostly by a beautiful, undulating country, well adapted to the production of Indian corn, wheat, and clover. Tobacco was formerly one of the staples, but of late years its culture has been nearly discontinued. Dover Mills, P. O. on Dover creek, near the Charlottesville road, 21 miles west from Richmond, 135 from W. and 10 miles below the C. H. A store is kept here, and recently a tavern has been built. The mill possesses advantages greater perhaps than any other in the county. Being situated at the bank of the James river canal, it has every command of water power, and facility for transportation to market. A large quantity of wheat is yearly manufactured into flour, and it is in many respects a place of much activity in business. It is in the midst of one of the finest wheat growing portions of the county, and also affords a market for some of the produce of the contiguous parts of Louisa and Hanover. Fife's P. O. 39 ms. W. of R. and 116 S. S. W. of W.—situated in the western part of the county, on the Charlottesville road, near its intersection with the mail route from Fredericksburg to Cartersville on James river, and Salisbury, N. C.

It is situated in a thickly settled neighborhood, in about two miles of James river. The land in the vicinity is of medium quality, adapted to the culture of oats, of which a large quantity is consumed at the adjacent coal pits. Saunderson's, P. O. 160 ms. S. S. W. of W. and 42 from R. Shannon Hill, P. O. on the Three Chopped road, 52 miles from R. and 147 S. S. W. of W.

V. 20 ms. from R., and 102 from W., situated on the north side of Machunp's creek, immediately on the main stage road leading from Richmond to Fredericksburg, 46 ms. from the latter place, on the top of the first range of hills inclining down to the creek, and about 1 mile above the junction of the creek with the Pamunky river. It is situated in a pleasant and wealthy neighbourhood, the river running almost entirely round it, making very extensive and fertile flats, highly productive in all kinds of grain usually cultivated in Virginia. The flat lands were naturally rich, and are now undergoing considerable improvement from the use of marle, which abounds on almost every estate in the neighbourhood. The marle in many instances is found several miles from the river, in very large and extensive beds, and very rich. This place contains a C. H., Clerk's office, and 2 jails, a very large and commodious tavern with various other houses, 1 mercantile store, 1 blacksmith, and 1 boot and shoe maker. Population about 50 persons of whom 1 is an attorney. "Hanover C. H. is famed for being the arena on which the famous Patrick Henry figured in early life. It was here that those speeches were delivered by him that fired the bosoms of his countrymen; and fixed and confirmed them in the manly spirit that so soon displayed itself in the expedition that was undertaken against Governor Dunmore, commonly called the gunpowder expedition. It was here that the first company of armed men were formed and organized in opposition to British tyranny, in Virginia; and in the walls of the present C. H. that the splendid and manly eloquence of the illustrious Henry was first heard, felt and fully acknowledged by his countrymen. It was here that his vivid fancy taking wing rose to some of the most sublime heights that human genius is capable of attaining, It was here that on one occasion he received in common with his countrymen intelligence of the premeditated aggressions against his country, by England, and inspired with the indignation which such a communication was calculated to produce on the mind of so intelligent, high minded and patriotic a spirit, he could not contain himself for a moment, and not seeking the customary rostrum he took advantage of the first convenient elevation which presented itself, and spoke in a strain, such as they had never before heard from man. The effect was as he desired, he awakened and aroused them to a just estimate of the lawless rule premeditated by the British ministry. The after events of his history are too well known to need commentary. To Hanover, also, the world is indebted for one of the first orators and politicians now figuring in the arena of American politics—Henry Clay— Clay was born and reared within 3 ms. of Hanover C. H. and the veneration in which this spot is held may be judged from the fact, that passengers in almost every stage which passes from time to time, are in the habit of getting out and visiting the C. H., and lingering away the passing hours in reminiscences of the master spirits that have rendered them illustrious. These same venerated walls have also in more modern date, been made to resound with the argumentative genius, and sonorous voice of the departed Morris, who was also a native of this old and venerable county." County and Corporation Courts are held on the 4th Tuesday in every month:—Quarterly in Feb. April, July, and October. Judge Clopton holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 26th of April, and 15th of September. Hanoverton, P. O. 31 ms. N. E. of R., and 94 S. S.

W. by James river, which separates it from Chesterfield; on the N. W. by Goochland; on the N. E. by Hanover and New Kent; and on the S. E. by the county of Charles City. Its mean length is 27 ms.; mean breadth 10¾ ms., and area 291 square ms., extending in lat from 37° 57′ to 37° 4′, and long. 0° 20′ to 0° 49′ W. of W. C. Henrico was one of the primitive counties or shires into which the colony was divided in 1634. Its territory was of course, at that time, very extensive, but repeated partitions in order to form other counties, have reduced it to its present comparatively small size. With the exception of the lands on James river, which are very fertile, the soil is generally light and unproductive. There are also some good farms on the Chickahominy, a small stream which divides the county from New Kent and Hanover, and enters James river above Jamestown. The surface is moderately undulating, terminating in abrupt precipices both on the Chickahominy and James river bottoms. Richmond, the metropolis of Virginia, is situated in the centre of the county in reference to its length from N. W. to S. E. (See Richmond City.) About a mile below town, the famous Indian King Powhatan had one of his principal lodges. The estate has been long in the possession of the Mayo family, and is known by the name of its former Indian proprietor. The population of Henrico, in 1800, exclusive of Richmond, was 9,149—and in 1830, according to the last census, 12,737—shewing an increase of 3,588, or nearly 40 per cent. in 30 years. Of its population last ascertained, there were free whites, 5,716—slaves, 5,932—free colored, 1,089. Total 12,737. Taxes paid in 1833, $13,470 16—and in 1834, on lots, $7,729 77—on Land, $3,170 73—on 7,580 slaves, $1,895— 3,290 horses, $197 88—4 studs, $270 00—266 coaches, $698 25—62 carryalls, $65 10—104 gigs, $79 95. Total $14,106 68. No report from school commissioners. The county is intersected by 3 good turnpike roads, having toll gates,—the Brook, Mechanicsville, and another leading to Petersburg on the north side of James river. There are few or no schools worthy of notice, except a Baptist Seminary, about 4 ms. from Richmond. The mass of the population are poor and uniformed, and are somewhat remarkable for a keen jealously of metropolitan influence. County Courts are held on the 1st Monday in every month, and Quarterly, March, June, August and November. Judge Clopton, holds his Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 8th of May, and 22d of October. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. RICHMOND CITY, the metropolis of Virginia, is situated in the county of Henrico, on the north side of James river, and immediately at the great falls, or head of tide water Lat. 37° 32′ N., long. 25° 54′ W. of W. Its location is uncommonly delightful, and has often excited the admiration of strangers. Perhaps the most glowing, and yet most faithful picture which has ever been drawn of its natural beauties, is from the pen of the eminent and lamented author of the British Spy. "I have never met, says that enchanting writer, "with such an assemblage of striking and interesting objects. The town dispersed over hills of various shapes; the river descending from west to east, and obstructed by a multitude of small islands, clumps of trees, and myriads of rocks; among which it tumbles, foams and roars; constituting what are called the falls; the same river at the lower end of the town, bending at right angles to the south, and winding reluctantly off for many miles in that direction; its polished surface caught here and there by the eye, but more generally covered from the view by the trees; among which the white sails of approaching and departing vessels exhibit a curious and interesting appearance then again on the opposite side, the little town of Manchester built on a hill, which sloping gently to the river, opens the whole town to the view, interspersed as it is with vigorous and flourishing poplars; and surrounded to a great distance by green plains and stately woods;—all these objects falling at once under the eye, constitute by far the most finely varied and most animated landscape that I have ever seen." The truth and beauty of the foregoing sketch may be realised from numberless positions or points of view, extending from the high hills to the west, which overlook the James river canal, as far as the Church Hill, the eastern barrier of the city. From the latter elevation, perhaps the landscape combines greater variety and grandeur, than from any other point Shockœ hill, however, is the favorite residence of the citizens. This is divided from the other by the valley of Shockœ creek, and is a high and spacious plain occupied by the principal public buildings, and by numerous private edifices, some of which are of elegant and expensive construction. The Capitol, or State House, stands in the centre of a beautiful park or square, near the brow of the hill, and from its size and elevated position is the most conspicuous object in the city. The exterior of the building is of admirable proportions, and its fine columns of Ionic architecture seen from a distance, have a very imposing effect. It was formed from a model of the Maison Carree at Nismes,—brought by Mr. Jefferson from France. Its interior construction, however, is neither elegant nor convenient. In a large open saloon or hall, in the centre of the building, is a marble statue of Washington, executed with great skill by Hodoun, a French artist. There is also a bust of Lafayette, occupying one of the niches in the wall. Besides the statue it is still in contemplation to erect a superb monument to the memory of Washington on the capitol square. The fund which was dedicated to this object was originally raised by private subscription, and is now loaned out at interest by direction of the legislature. Its present amount is about $18,000. When this monument is erected, it will add to the attractions of one of the finest promenades in the Union. The square which contains about 9 acres, is enclosed by a handsome railing of cast iron, and is ornamented by gravelled walks, and a variety of forest and other trees. The Governor's House is a plain, neat building, adjoining the square, and on a part of the public domain. The City Hall, which is also contiguous to the State House, is a costly and elegant building of Doric architecture. It is devoted to the use of the City Courts and Council, and other officers of the Corporation. The other public buildings, are the Penitentiary and Manufactory of Arms— both extensive establishments, and well adapted to their respective purposes. The Bank of Virginia and Farmer's Bank, are connected under one roof, and together constitute a handsome edifice on the principal street. Richmond is not deficient in benevolent institutions. Besides a very spacious Poor House, which stands in the suburbs of the city,—there is a Female Orphan Asylum, supported in part by funds of the corporation, and partly by private liberality. Its funds have been principally raised however for several years past, by an annual fair held at the City Hall. This institution is incorporated by the legislature, and is under the management of female directors. There is also a school for the education of poor children of both sexes, upon the Lancasterian system, founded in 1816, which with some fluctuations in its progress, is still in a prosperous condition. It is now under the superintendance of trustees appointed by the City Council, and is sustained by an annual contribution from the Literary fund of the state, together with an appropriation from the city treasury. A suitable building was erected for the accommodation of the school, soon after its first establishment, and hundreds have received from it the benefits of elementary instruction, who would probably have been otherwise the victims of ignorance and depravity. The City has not been so fortunate in other institutions for the cultivation of the mind. A few good schools it is true have occasionally existed, where a competent knowledge of the classics and some of the sciences might be obtained, but none of these sources of instruction have been commensurate with the wants of the citizens. It is a remarkable circumstance, that the metropolis of the state, containing as it does considerable wealth aud population,—many distinguished and well informed men, and much boasted refinement, should yet be destitute of a single academical institution. As far back as 1803, a charter was obtained from the state by some of the prominent citizens, for the establishment of an academy by lottery and private subscription. A few thousand dollars were raised,—a site was injudiciously selected a mile beyond the limits of the city—and the basement story of the building erected, but no further progress was made. Within the present year, however, the vacancies in the Board of Trustees have been filled, and there is some prospect of reviving the institution. Besides this marked deficiency in the means of educating youth, there are few or no associations of an intellectual character among persons of maturer years. Whilst the northern cities can boast of their literary and scientific societies, the capital of the ancient dominion scarcely contains one which deserves the name. An honorable exception, it is true, may be mentioned in the "Virginia Historical and Philosophical Society," which was established in 1831, and has since been incorporated;—but as its members are principally dispersed through the state, and few of the citizens of Richmond manifest any zeal in its welfare, it can scarcely be considered an association of the city, either in its origin or character. About 20 years since a Museum was erected principally by individual enterprize; which was designed as a repository of the fine arts, and of natural curiosities. This institution however, has for a long time languished for want of patronage. Societies however of a moral and religious cast, are numerous, active, and flourishing. Various associations exist for promoting temperance, for colonizing the free people of color, for aiding missionaries, for the distribution of the Bible and religious tracts, and for various other objects of a similar character. The encouragement also which is given to Sabbath schools is extensive and beneficial. The means of religious instruction are very considerable, and probably in due proportion to the wants of the city. The Episcopalians have 3 churches or houses of worship;—the Presbyterians 2, the Baptists 3, the Methodists 3, the Roman Catholics 1, and this last congregation are now constructing a new and elegant building, which will probably rival any in the city for the style of its artichecture. The Baptists Seceders or followers of Alexander Campbell, have 1 place of worship,—the Unitarians and Quakers 1 each,—and the Jews a handsome Synagogue in a retired and handsome situation. The Monumental Church, one of the three belonging to the Episcopalians, and of which the venerable Bishop of Eastern Virginia has long been the Rector,—has acquired a melancholy celebrity from the circumstance that it occupies the site of the Richmond Theatre, which was destroyed by fire in December 1811; on which tragical occasion the Governor of the Commonwealth, and 70 or 80 respectable persons of both sexes perished miserably in the flames. Long will that mournful event be remembered by those who survived or witnessed its horrors!—Either from the deep impressions which it produced or from other causes,—the taste for theatrical exhibitions has not kept pace with the increase of wealth and population. The commodious Theatre which succeeded the old one,— which is placed in a far more eligible situation, and is of much safer construction, is only occasionally patronized when the appearance of some attractive star, or celebrated performer is announced. Richmond was first established by act of Assembly, as early as 1742, and became the seat of Government of the state in 1779. Various legislative acts have passed from time to time enlarging its corporate powers and privileges. Nine persons are annually chosen from each of the three wards into which the city is divided, who when assembled elect out of their own body a recorder, and 11 aldermen, who exercise judicial functions. The same persons also elect from their own body, or from the citizens at large, a Mayor, who is both a judicial and executive officer. The remaining 15 members constitute the legislative council of the city, and as such, are authorized to raise and appropriate money, and to enact all such ordinances as are necessary for the due exeeution of the powers conferred by the charter. The valuation of real property within the city according to the assessment of 1833, was $6,614,550. The revenue raised for corporation purposes may be stated in round numbers at $60,000, besides which, the city contributed as its quota of the state tax in the year 1833, nearly $9,000. This large amount of taxation is principally derived from real and personal property, and from licenses to merchants, ordinary keepers, &amp;c. The number of wholesale merchants, paying license tax in 1833, as appears by the returns of the State Commissioner was 20;—retail ditto 326, auctioneers 7, lottery ticket venders 7, ordinary keepers 43, and keepers of houses of private entertainment 9. According to the same returns there were 739 horses and mules, 157 coaches, 9 carryalls, and 54 gigs. The expenses of the city are considerable. The principal items of appropriation are $12,000 for a sinking fund, to pay the interest, and redeem gradually the corporation debt; $4,000 for the poor; $1,700 to the Lancasterian Free School and Orphan Asylum; $4000 for repairing the streets; and $8,500 for the support of a night watch. The remaining expenses are on account of the public markets, fire companies, salaries of officers, paving of streets and various contingencies. The city debt at this time amounts to $136,150;—$95,000 of which, bearing an interest of 5 per centum only, was incurred on account of the water works. These works were commenced in September 1830, under the direction of Albert Stein, an accomplished Engineer from Holland, and were completed as far as originally designed, at the end of the ensuing year. Since that time, a second pump and wheel, and a third reservoir have been added; making the cost of the whole work about $100,000. The pumps are each calculated to raise from the river, and propel into the resevoirs at a distance of 800 yards, and at a considerable elevation 400,000 gallons of water in 24 hours. These pumps are designed to operate alternately, either being competent to fill the reservoirs in sufficient time. The reservoirs will each of them contain 1,000,000 gallons,—and double lines of pipes extend from them to the pump house on the margin of the river. The main pipe from the resevoirs to the intersection of H. and 1st streets is 2,058 yards in length; and the smallest pipes extend from this thro' the principal streets, lessening in diameter to the point of greatest depression from the level of the resevoirs, a distance of about 3 ms. Fire plugs are placed at convenient distances along the line of pipes, and afford an ample supply of water for extinguishing fires. In the lower part of the city the pressure is sufficient to force the water to the tops of the houses through hose, without the aid of engines. Three hundred and forty houses and tenements are already furnished with water, and the rents which are daily increasing, amount at this time, April 1834, to $4,000. The annual expense of superintendance, &amp;c. is $1,000. These works may justly be considered the pride of the city. The water which they supply is not only pure and wholesome, but for a considerable part of the year is sufficiently clear to be used without filters. The exports of domestic produce from Richmond to foreign countries are very considerable. In the year 1833, their value in American vessels, was $2,466,360 00 And in foreign vessels, 498,131 00 Making the ag'rt. of $2,964, 491 00 The value of domestic produce shipped coastwise to the principal Northern Cities, cannot be ascertained correctly. It is believed to be at least equal if not greater than the amount exported to foreign countries, and if such be the fact, the total value of produce shipped, may be estimated at nearly $6,000,000. The import trade, however, bears no proportion to the other. The value of merchandize imported into the district of Richmond from foreign countries for the year 1833, amounted to only $209,963, and the duties paid to the Government of the United States to $75,120. Of this latter sum, $7,197 was paid on merchandize brought by foreign vessels. In 1833, 5 schooners, 9 barks, 37 brigs, and 30 ships, in all 81 vessels, cleared from the port of Richmond for foreign countries, the tonnage whereof amounted to 22,331, or an average of 275 tons to each vessel. In the same year 4 schooners, 6 brigs, 2 barks, and 3 ships entered from foreign countries,—making in the aggregate, 3,412 tons, or 227 to each vessel. No inconsiderable part of the produce shipped from the city is brought down the James River Canal. This important improvement commences at Maiden's Adventure, on James river about 30 miles distant, and terminates in a deep and commodious basin in the heart of the town. The tolls paid to the James River Company on produce descending in the year 1833, amounted to $43,949, and on various articles carried up the Canal to $10,139, making in the aggregate, $54,088. Among the items brought down, may be enumerated upwards of 15,000 hhds. of tobacco, 152,000 barrels of flour, 133,000 bushels of wheat, 677,664 bushels of coal, 1,374 tons of bar and pig iron; and 2,230900 lbs. of manufactured tobacco. Among the ascending articles may be mentioned, nearly 31,000 sacks of salt, 297 tons of bar and pig iron, and upwards of 3,000 tons of plaster, lime, &amp;c. The proximity of the coal mines to 25 Richmond, constitutes that mineral a valuable article of commerce. Besides the quantity brought down the canal, there were more than 2,000,000 of bushels (4 pecks to the bushel) transported on the Chesterfield Rail Road in 1833, the tolls on which amounted to $87,813 30. The Chesterfield Rail Road, terminates on the Manchester side of the river, and deserves to be honorably mentioned as the first successful enterprize of the kind in the state of Virginia. It was planned and executed under the direction of Moncure Robinson, a distinguished Engineer, and it owes much in its original design and final accomplishment, to the perseverance and patronage of Mr Mills, one of the few proprietors of its stock, and an owner of one of the extensive coal mines at the upper termination of the road. James river from Richmond to the ocean, presents a tedious and somewhat obstructed navigation. This with the circumstance that she is surrounded by rival towns, each having its peculiar advantages of location,— will probably prevent the metropolis from ever attaining a high degree of commercial importance. There is no doubt, however, of its final destination as a manufacturing city,—as there is probably no spot in the Union endowed by nature with finer facilities for that kind of industry. From the commencement of the rapids a few miles above, the fall is upwards of 100 feet to the level of tide water, and in all this space there is scarcely a limit to the extent of water power which exists. In the city and its vicinity, there are already several flourishing establishments which deserve to be mentioned. The Gallego Flour Mills having been destroyed by fire in the spring of 1833, their present proprietor, Mr. Chevallie, is rebuilding them at a more convenient site on the bank of the James river basin, and upon a much more improved and enlarged plan. The mill house which is nearly completed, is 6 stories high from the foundation and covered with tin. It is 94 feet long by 83½ wide, and is calculated for 20 pair of stones to be worked by 3 water wheels. Connected with it is another building 80 feet square, and 4 stories high, in which the wheat will be received and cleaned. The two together present a front on the basin of 163½ feet, and the whole appearance is very imposing. The old Gallego Mills ground upwards of 200,000 bushels of wheat in the 8 months preceding their destruction. It is probable that the operations of the new establishments will be much more extensive. The Gallego brand, and indeed that of the City Mills generally, has acquired much celebrity in the South American markets and elsewhere. Haxall's Mills, have also a high reputation: they are 5 stories high and of nearly equal dimensions with Chevallie's. They work 14 pair of stones, with 4 water wheels, and grind about 200,000 bushels wheat annually. This year that quantity will probably be exceeded, as it is contemplated to add 4 additional pair of stones. Rutherford's Mill works 8 pair of stones by 2 water wheels, and grinds about 90,000 bushels of wheat annually. Mayo's Mill in Manchester opposite to Richmond, works 6 pair of stones by 3 water wheels, and grinds also about 90,000 bushels of wheat annually. In the city and its vicinity, there are 5 corn or grist mills, 2 manufactories for cut nails, and rolling and slitting iron, 2 saw mills, and 1 iron foundery, whose operations are extensive. The Richmond Cotton Manufactory is a large and important establishment. It was established by Cunningham &amp; Anderson, in the year 1829, and sold by them with all its appendages, to the Richmond Manu facturing Company, incorporated by an act of the Virginia legislature in the winter of 1831. The building is of stone and brick, 4 stories high, 146 feet long, and 44 feet wide, situated upon the north bank of the James, a few hundred yards west of the Armory, receiving its water power from the James river canal, immediately below the Penitentiary. The water is also conveyed from the canal in iron pipes of 6 inches bore to the building, thence up the stair-way to within 5 feet of the eaves, from which in case of accident by fire, every floor except the upper one, can be flooded in a few seconds, by simply turning a cock and using a hose. In this factory are employed from 60 to 70 white operatives and 130 blacks, from the age of 14 and upwards,—a large proportion of both descriptions are females. It runs 3,776 spindles, and 80 looms, together with all the necessary preparatory machinery for spinning and weaving, of the most approved kinds, and consumes about 1,500 pounds of raw cotton per day. The fabrics are heavy,—negro shirtings 29 inches wide, 4-4 sheetings and ¾ shirtings of No. 16 yarn, and cotton yarns from No. 5 to 20— all of which are celebrated for their superior quality. The capital employed is $120,000. The Gallego Manufacturing Company was incorporated in January 1834, and the capital subscribed is $150,000. The buildings which it is supposed, will be commenced the present year, will be located near the Gallego Mills. The Franklin Company for the manufacture of paper, has also been recently incorporated, and the capital nearly subscribed. Besides the manufactures produced at the Penitentiary on state account, the city has its due proportion of the various mechanic trades, and private manufactories. Of printing establishments there are as many as 11, (perhaps an undue proportion) from 2 of which there are issued daily, political and commercial papers,—from 1, a semi-weekly political,—from 3, weekly Religious,—and from 1, a monthly journal devoted to literature, &amp;c. The others are either Book or Job Offices. The number of professional men is also considerable, and it is the more remarkable that so many members of the medical faculty should find employment in a city proverbial for the salubrity of its climate. Situated at the point of demarcation between the upper and lower districts, it is fortunately exempt from many of the maladies which are peculiar to both regions. It is neither visited by the enervating autumnal diseases of eastern Virginia, nor by the more violent and inflammatory attacks which belong to the upper country. The yellow fever that scourge of cities more populous and commercial, has never prevailed. The population of Richmond has nearly trebled in 30 years. By the census of 1800, the free whites numbered, 2,837 Slaves, 2,293 Free colored persons, 607 5,737 By the census of 1830, the free whites amounted to 7,755 Slaves, 6,349 Free colored, 1,956 16,060 The several classes have increased in nearly corresponding ratios. Richmond has been frequently reproached for a want of hospitality, and if this virtue consists in unreserved and indiscriminate attention to strangers and visitors,—the reproach is probably not altogether unfounded. It must be acknowledged too, that the manners and customs of what are called the leading classes, are not characteristic of the old Virginia character, which was frank, simple and unostentatious. In almost all consid- erable towns, even in republican America, artificial castes or classes exist, which are founded principally upon the possession of wealth, or the mysterious refinements of fashion, and have but little reference either to moral or intellectual distinction. It is probable that this vice of cities is one of the chief sources of that prejudice which is felt towards them by the people of the country. These remarks, however, are not to be construed into a sweeping censure upon towns,—for although in all dense populations, there is always a greater or less degree of human infirmity,— there is also an equal concentration of the more virtuous and noble qualities of our nature.

There is great variety in the soil in the neighborhood, the land being of a free, productive character, and well watered; but not very fertile except on the water courses. At this place there are strong indications of gold and iron, which are thought to be abundant in this section of country. There are located here a mercantile store, saddler, house of entertainment, and a blacksmith shop. Population 25 persons: one of whom is a physician. ISLE OF WIGHT. Isle of Wight was one of the eight original shires, into which Virginia was divided in 1634. Its rame was originally Warrosquyoake shire. It is bounded N. by James river, which separates it from James City, and Warwick counties,—E. and S. by Nansemond,—W. by Blackwater river, which separates it from Southampton,—and N. W. by Surry. Its length is 37 miles, width 11; and area 407 square miles; and it extends in lat. from 36° 38′ to 37° 07′ N. and in long. from 0° 02′ to 0° 36′ E. of W. C. This county inclines to the N. E. and S. W. towards the James and Blackwater. It has many creeks and swamps upon its surface, and a great variety of soil, though it is generally thin and sandy. Population in 1820, 10,139—1830, 10,517. It belongs to the first judicial circuit and first district. Tax paid in 1832-3, $1840 95; in 1833-4— on lots, $94 34—on land, $906 62—2178 slaves, $544 50—1176 horses, $70 56—7 studs, $68 00—25 coaches, $59 90—6 carryalls, $6 00—219 gigs, $125 62.

H. and 28 N. of Jerusalem, the seat of justice of Southampton county. Smithfield, P. V. in the northern part of the county, 80 ms S. E. by E. of R. and 204 from W. C. It is situated on the south side of Pagan creek, a bold and navigable stream, 3 ms. from James river and 15 above Hampton Roads, on an elevated bank, about 25 feet above the waters of the creek, commanding a beautiful view of both land and water scenery,—the country for 10 ms. on the opposite side of James river is in full view. It contains 350 houses, some of them handsome, 10 general stores, and one apothecary shop, 3 spacious houses of public worship, 1 Episcopalian, 1 Baptist and 1 Methodist, 1 hotel kept in the best style, and several boarding houses, a male and a female academy, in which are taught all the branches of polite education, 4 other schools containing generally 150 pupils jointly, children being sent here to school from the surrounding country, and some from great distances, in consequence of the healthiness of the place. The mechanical pursuits are 1 saddler, 1 cabinet maker, 2 tailors, working constantly several hands, 2 coach making establishments, 1 extensive tannery; and in the vicinity 2 cotton manufactories. The Bacon curing business is carried on here to great perfection, more extensively and perhaps more profitably than in any other place in the U. S. The bacon cured here has long been celebrated for its superior flavor, and the manner in which it is cured;—large quantities of it are shipped annually in coasting vessels; it commands the preference in all the markets, and it is a source of great revenue. The village is located on the main post road leading from Petersburg to Norfolk 60 ms. from the former, and 40 from the latter Population 850 persons; of whom 3 are attorneys and 3 regular physicians. JAMES CITY. James City was one of the eight original shires, into which Virginia was divided by the Legislature in 1634. It is bounded on the N. and N. W. by New Kent, W. by the Chickahominy river, which separates it from Charles City; S. by James river, which separates it from Surry, and E. by Warwick and York counties, and York river, separating it from Gloucester. Its length is 23 miles, its mean breadth 8; and area 184 square miles; and it extends in lat from 37° 09′ to 37° 25′ N. and in long from 0° 03′ to 0° 24′ E. of W. C. The surface of the county is in undulating hills. Population in 1820, 3,161—1830, 3,838. It belongs to the third judicial circuit; and second district. Tax paid in 1832-3, $655 44, in 1833-4 on land, 303 41—1001 slaves, $250 25—397 horses, $23 82—2 studs, $30 00—8 coaches, $17 00—2 carryalls, $2 00—81 gigs, $43 80. Total, $670 28. In 1832 no school commissions report. Expended in 1833 in educating poor children, $54 23. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. James Town. This town the first British settlement in America (1607,) now no longer exists as a place of resort to the merchant or artizan; but the spot on which it stood must ever be full of interest to the Antiquarian and the Historian. The land on which it stood has been for a number of years in the family of the Amblers, and has been for some time past in cultivation. The only relic of the olden time, which is pointed out to the traveller, as he hurries past with the swiftness of the wind in the fleet and beautiful and modern steamers which navigate the James, is an old chimney, which we believe belonged to a church. This old town, stood on a point of land projecting into James river in the southern part of James City Co., in lat. 37° 12′ and long. 0° 14′ E. of W. C. Stith, in his history of Virginia, (p. 160) says that in the latter end of June 1619 Sir George Yeardley, then Governor, called the first assembly that was ever held in Virginia, at Jamestown; which at that time and for many years afterwards was called James City. Counties not being then laid off, the representatives of the people were elected by townships: the Boroughs of Jamestown, Henrico, Bermuda Hundred and others, sending their members to the assembly; from which circumstances, the lower house was first called the House of Burgesses. The acts of this assembly, says Stith, were remitted to England and presented to the London Company, to be read in the court on the 20th March following; for the company had then the regal power of confirming or annulling the acts of assembly. We refer to the compendious history of Virginia, in the first part of this work, for more information concerning the history of James Town. WILLIAMSBURG, P. T. and seat of justice for James City county, situated on the summit level between the rivers of York and James; six miles distant from each, though navigable streams for small vessels approach on either side, within one mile of the city, 60 miles E. of R. 12 N. of York Town, and 163 miles from W.—lat. 37° 16′ and long. 0° 20′ E. of W.; immediately on the line dividing the counties of York and James City, embracing a part of each county in the corporation. This little city, though it has not advanced much in wealth or population, has many very interesting claims on the student of the U. S. It was the cradle of our political existence, and for a long time the seat of government of "infant Virginia." It now contains about 200 dwelling houses, some of which are going fast to decay, and more than 1500 inhabitants, many of whom are wealthy. It is pleasantly laid out in parallel streets, with a pleasant square in the centre of more than 10 acres, where is situated the Court-house, Clerk's Office, and Markethouse, lately built, through which runs the principal street, east and west, one mile in length and more than 100 feet in width. There is also a beautiful green square fronting the old Palace, which was formerly the residence of the Colonial Governor. At one end of this street stands the remains of the old Capitol, which was consumed by fire, in April, 1832, and at the other William and Mary College. The place where this city now stands, and the adjacent country, was first known by the name of the Middle Plantations, and was settled in 1632, by drafts from the adjoining settlements, principally from James Town, 7 miles distant. This place became the seat of government of this colony in 1698, some short time previous to which a great fire occurred at Jamestown, which consumed the public records, and a larger part of the town, and continued as such until 1779, when it was removed to Richmond. The old Raleigh Tavern, where many important committees of the Legislature met—where some of our most distinguished patriots concerted measures for aiding in the arduous struggle for liberty, and where, it is said, Richard H. Lee and others originated the plan to establish corresponding committees throughout many or all of the colonies, is yet remaining, and is occupied as a public house; over the portico of which is placed a bust of Sir Walter Raleigh. William and Mary College, which was founded in 1693, during the reign of William and Mary, who granted to it a donation of 20,000 acres of land; is situated at this place, and with various fortunes of advance and recession, has continued to exist as a respectable Literary Institution. Besides this donation it received a penny a lb duty, on certain tobaccos, exported from Virginia and Maryland, which had been levied by the statute of the 25th of Charles II. The Assembly also gave it, by temporary laws, a duty on liquors imported, and skins and furs exported. From these resources it received upwards of £3000, communibus annis. The buildings are of brick and sufficiently large for the accommodation of 100 students. By its charter dated the 8th of February 1692, it was placed under the direction of not less than 20 Visitors, and to have a President and 6 Professors, who were incorporated. It was formerly allowed a representative in the General Assembly. Under this charter a professorship of the Greek and Latin languages, a professorship of Mathematics, one of Moral Philosophy, and two of Divinity were established. To these were annexed, for a sixth professorship, a considerable donation, by Mr Boyle of England, for the instruction of the Indians and their conversion to christianity. This was called the professorship of Brafferton, from an estate of that name in England purchased with the monies given. The admission of the learners of Latin and Greek filled the College with children. This rendering it disagreeable, and degrading to young men already prepared for entering on the sciences, they were discouraged from resorting to it, and thus the school for Mathematics and Moral Philosophy, which might have been of some service, became of very little. The revenues too were exhausted in accommodating those who came only to acquire the rudiments of science. After the revolution, the Visitors, having no power to change those circumstances in the constitution of the College, which were fixed by the charter, and being therefore confined in the number of professorships, undertook to change the object of the professorships. They excluded the two schools for Divinity, and that for the Greek and Latin languages, and substituted others. At present it has 19 acting Visitors, and is under the superintendency of a President and 5 Professors, embracing the Professor of Humanity, who has charge of the classical department. There is also a Law department in this Institution. Fronting the building is a beautiful green square, of about 4 acres, In the walk leading from the gate to the College, stands the marble statue of Norborne Berkeley, (Lord Bottetourt,) who was formerly Governor of Virginia, and a man distinguished for love of piety, literature, and in the early part of his administration good government, which was removed from the old Capitol in 1797, where it was first erected, at the expense of the colony, in 1774. It is much mutilated, though it still presents a specimen of superior sculpture. A very respectable Female Academy, and 3 other private schools are established in this place. There is also here a Lunatic Hospital, sufficiently large for the accommodation of 60 patients, in separate rooms or cells; and an addition is now making to enlarge the building, by an increase of 24 cells. The hospital is neatly kept and the patients are well attended. Besides the court house, and other public buildings mentioned, there is a public jail, an Episcopal church, Methodist chapel, and one Baptist meeting house. The public buildings were no doubt erected at great expense, but now present the appearance of decaying grandeur. There are also 16 stores, 1 manufactory a short distance from the city, 4 merchant mills in the vicinity, 3 tanyards, 1 saddler's shop, and a number of mechanics, who are generally employed, 2 benevolent societies, 9 attornies, and 5 regular physicians. This city is remarkably healthy for 9 months of the year. It has the reputation of being unhealthy the maining 3 months, though for many years past it has been quite the reverse. County Courts are held on the 2d Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, May, August and November. Judge Upshur holds his Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery on the 7th of April and the 22d of October. KING &amp; QUEEN. King &amp; Queen was created by act of the Colonial Legislature in 1691, in the third year of the reign of William and Mary, and formed out of a part of New Kent county. It is bounded by Caroline on the N. W.—Essex N. E.—Piankatank river, separating it from Middlesex, E.—Gloucester S. E.—James river S.—and Matapony river, separating it from King William S. W. and W.—Its length is 40 miles, mean width 11, and area 335 sq. miles—Extending in lat from 36° 27′ to 37° 56′ N. and in long. from 0° 18′ E. to 0° 13′ W. of W. C. The surface slopes southward towards Matapony river, or southeastward towards Piankatank. Large and extensive banks of marle run entirely through the county, which furnish an inexhaustible source of improvement to this once barren soil. many of the most enterprising farmers have tried it, and the land which previously produced only six to eight bushels of maize or Indian corn to the acre, now bring 20 and 25; and as might be anticipated from such a result a considerable spirit of improvement has been excited among the farmers. Marshes abound in this county, and if reclaimed would doubtless prove valuable.—No county in the state contains memorials of greater magnificence than King &amp; Queen, —on the Matapony a beautiful stream which borders the southern part of the county, till it empties into the York river, are the vestiges of many ancient and once highly improved seats.—Among these we might enumerate Laneville—Pleasant Hill—Mantapike—Mantua—Rickohoe —White Hall, &amp;c.—known as the former residences of the Braxtons, Corbins, Robinsons, &amp;c. The prevailing religion of King &amp; Queen, is that of the Baptists, who have seven churches, and five ministers. The Methodists have four houses of public worship. There is one free for all denominations, and one belonging to the reformed Baptists (or Campbellites.) There are four classical, and many common schools; one extensive manufacturing flour mill, and 25 others, and 2 tanyards. Population 1820, 11,798 —in 1830, 11,644. This county belongs to the fourth judicial circuit and second district. Taxes paid in 1833, $2340 91—in 1834, on lots, $1 79— on land, $1042 18—3064 slaves, $766 00—1439 horses, $86 34—5 studs, $82 00—50 coaches, $127 00—1 stage, $2 50—10 carryalls, $12 30— 26 315 gigs, $176 20—Total, $2296 31. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $320 22—in 1833, $329 37. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Bruington, P. O. 36 miles N. E. of R. and 240 from Washington;— situated in the N. E. part of the county. Carlton's Store, P. O. 44 ms. E. of R. and 137 from W. Clarkston, P. O. 32 ms. N. E. of R. and 115 from W. Dunkirk, P. O. some times called Todd's bridge, 54 ms. N. E. of R. and 140 S. W. of W.—It is situated on the left bank of Mattapony river, at the head of tide water, 60 miles above York Town, on the main post road leading from Richmond to Tappahannock, 22 miles from the latter. It now contains only one mercantile store, and two dwelling houses. This place was at one time a village of considerable trade, it was the depot for the merchandise, and much of the agricultural produce of the contiguous upper country; but its extreme sickliness combined with other causes, has nearly obliterated it from existence. There is a toll bridge across the Mattapony at this place, owned by a private individual. KING &amp; QUEEN C. H. 49 ms. from Richmond, and 142 from Washington,—situated on the flat lands of the Mattapony, about three quarters of a mile from the river. It contains besides the usual county buildings, 4 dwelling houses, 2 miscellaneous stores, a tavern, a magazine, and a tanyard. There is in the vicinity a flour manufacturing mill and a grist mill which also has machinery for grinding and packing cotton. Population 14 whites; of whom 1 is an attorney, and 1 a physician, and 40 colored—total 54. This village is proverbially unhealthy, being nearly surrounded by marshes, —to this circumstance may be attributed the small amount of its population. County Courts are held on the 2d Monday in every month,—Quarterly in March, May, August and Nov'r. Judge Semple holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 1st Monday in May and November. Little Plymouth, P. V. 57 ms. N. E. by E. of R. and 150 from W. situated in the southern part of the county.

It contains 3 dwelling houses 1 miscellaneous store, and 1 extensive flour manufacturing mill. KING GEORGE. King George was created by the legislature in 1720, from a part of Richmond County. It is bounded N. by the Potomac river, separating it from Charles County, Md. E. by Westmoreland, S. by the Rappahannock river, which separates it from Essex and Caroline, and W. by Stafford. Its length is 18 ms. mean breadth 10, and area 180 sq. ms. It extends in lat. from 38° 11′, to 38° 23′ N. and in long. from 0° 03′, E. to 0° 13′ W. of W. C. The surface is hilly and soil diversified. Population in 1820, 6,116—in 1830, 6,397. It belongs to the 5th judicial circuit and 3d district. Tax paid in 1832-3, $1,724 87—in 1833-4, on lots, $4 68—on land, $1,023 09—on 1,931 slaves, $482 75—1,353 horses, $81 18—4 studs, $37 00—32 coaches, $75 95—14 carryalls, $14 00—73 gigs, $42 10. Total $1,760 75. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $249 92, in 1833, $225 27. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Hampstead, P. O. in the S. E. angle of the county, 96 ms. N. E. of R., and 86 ms. S. W. of W. Hampstead is called a village on the post office list, but is in truth merely an old established post office, perhaps the oldest in the county, and equally long known as a stand for a store. It is situated 1 mile from Boyd's hole on the western shore of the Potomac, and about 6 ms. N. E. of King George C. H. in a rich country: the staples of which are, corn, wheat and cotton. There are no manufactures in the Northern neck; agriculture is the pursuit of the whole population. Within a mile and a half of Hampstead, there is a Protestant Episcopal church of the largest class of country churches, built of brick:—it is called St. Paul's, and its congregation embraces all the middle and lower part of the county. The Rev. Mr. Goldsmith is its present pastor. KING GEORGE C. H. P. O. situated near the centre of the county, 88 ms. N. N. E. of R., and 78 ms. S. W. of W. There are besides the usual county buildings, 14 dwelling houses, 1 general store, and 1 tavern. The mechanics are, tailors, boot and shoe makers, saddlers, blacksmiths, &amp;c. Population 50 persons; of whom 1 is a physician. County Courts are held on the 1st Thursday, in every month:—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Lomax holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery, on the 1st of May and 8th of October. Millville, P. V. 97 ms. from R., and 87 ms. S. of W. This village contains 8 dwelling houses, 2 general stores, 1 grist mill, 1 blacksmith and 1 shoemaker shop, and 19 inhabitants. Millville is situated on the head water of Rosier's creek, which divides King George and Westmoreland counties, so that a part of the village is in each county. Port Conway, P. V. and Sea Port, 60 ms. from R., and 79 ms. S. of W., situated on the N. side of the Rappahannock, opposite to P. Royal, in Caroline, in the S. W. part of the county. It contains 13 dwelling houses, 2 mercantile stores, and several mechanics. The land in the vicinity is considered fertile, and well adapted to corn and wheat, the only crops cultivated to any extent. The location is a beautiful one for a large town, the land extending back for 2 ms. in a perfect level. Some years since there was a tobacco warehouse, and inspection at this place, and con- siderable trade carried on in that article, but of late years the farmers have abandoned its cultivation, and turned their attention to wheat and corn. Population of Port Conway 35. KING WILLIAM. King William was established by the legislature in 1701, and formed out of a part of King &amp; Queen Co. It is bounded on the N. W. by the county of Caroline, on the S. and W. by the Pamunkey river, which separates it from Hanover and New Kent, and on the N., and E. by the Mattapony river, which separates it from the county of King &amp; Queen. Its mean length is 32 ms.—its mean breadth 8½ ms., and it contains 270 sq. ms. It extends in lat from 37° 30′, to 37° 57′ N., and in long from 0° 09′ E. to 0′ 19′ W. of W. This county lies very much in the figure of an isosceles triangle, extending from its boundary line with Caroline as its base, for a distance of 45 ms. between the two rivers Pamunkey and Mattapony, to their confluence at West Point, the head of York river. These two branches of York river fertilize a large portion of this narrow county, and afford the most convenient navigation, as well as fine shad and herring fisheries. Excellent oysters and crabs are taken in great abundance a few miles below West Point, and even at West Point, where the water is strongly impregnated with salt. The Pamunkey is navigable by schooners carrying about 1,600 bushels, from the Oyster-shell Landing, 2 ms. by land, below Dabney's Ferry; which last point is considered the head of tide water, and is about 35 ms. above West Point, and 16 ms. N. of the City of Richmond. The Mattapony is navigable by vessels of somewhat larger burthen, (say 2,000 bushels) from Aylett's, a small village, on the S. bank of the river, about 30 ms. above West Point, and 28 ms. N. of the City of Richmond, and 20 ms. from Tappahannock, in the county of Essex. Navigation is extended a few miles above Aylett's, to Dunkirk bridge by boats and small schooners, with light loads. With very trifling expense or trouble, the navigation might be made good to Dunkirk for any vessel that could reach Aylett's and the river might be readily and cheaply cleared out, so as to afford good boat navigation many miles higher. The crops are chiefly of corn, and wheat, although oats and cotton are profitably cultivated. Tobacco (as in most of the tide water counties) has been almost abandoned. Very profitable business may be, and no doubt will be done by shipping wood and timber for market from this county. Rumford Academy is the only public seminary in the county worthy of notice. It is an excellent brick building, calculated to accommodate 40 or 50 pupils with board, situated immediately on the road leading from Aylett's to the C. H. and 5 ms. distant from either place, in a very healthy and agreeable part of the county. This has been always esteemed an institution of considerable merit, and has generally enjoyed an excellent school, in which the usual branches of an academic education are taught. It is now in good hands, and may be justly recommended to the public. There is a Post Office at this Academy. This is a very religious county, with but little, if any appearance of bigotry, intolerance or fanaticism. The Baptists are the most numerous sect, of whom the Reformers constitute the larger portion. There is a very respectable congregation of Methodists, who have a large and excellent house for public worship, called Powell's chapel. There are also a few Presbyterians, who usually attend religious worship at the Acquintaine church. There are 4 brick churches, viz.—Mangohick, Cat tail, Acquintaine and West Point Church. These churches are for the most part used by the Baptists, but free for all denominations. There is also an excellent Baptist meeting house called Beulah, used exclusively, it is believed by what are commonly denominated the old Baptists. Population in 1820, 9,697— in 1830, 9,319, whereof 3,389 were whites—and 5,930 blacks. This county belongs to the 4th judicial circuit and second district. Taxes paid in 1833, $2,565 87—in 1834, on lots, $20—on land, $1,238 76—3,319 slaves, $829 75—1,655 horses, $99 30—7 studs, $100 00—67 coaches, $152 00—14 carryalls $14 00—222 gigs, $126 26.

E. of R., and 110 from W., situated at the head of navigation on the banks of Mattapony river, a branch of York river, about 30 ms. from its junction with the Pamunkey, to form York river. It contains 15 dwelling houses, 3 mercantile stores, and 4 groceries. The mechanics are, tailors, house carpenters, wheelwrights, blacksmiths, &amp;c. Population 50 whites, and 60 colored. Total 110 Aylett's, in proportion to the inhabitants it contains, is a place of considerable trade. Many thousand bushels of grain, are shipped annually to the neighboring markets, and coastwise. Vessels of easy draft of water can ascend up the Mattapony, and load at this village; but down about 8 ms. below the bar in the river, vessels of the burthen of 3 to 4,000 bushels meet with no obstruction in the navigation. In the vicinity of this place are several manufacturing flour mills, and 5 houses of public worship, 1 Episcopalian, 2 Methodist, and 2 Baptist. Rumford Academy is situated 4 ms. distant, and is a seminary of respectable standing. The soil of the surrounding country, is light, sandy loam, and better adapted to the culture of maize, cotton and peas, than wheat, or tobacco: and immediately on the river flats is quite productive. The inhabitants of the neighbourhood are intelligent, and in easy circumstances. Several handsome mansions are located near it, built in a modern and handsome style, and their fine appearance adds importance and beauty to this little village. Brandywine, lies at the intersection of the road leading from Aylett's to Newcastle ferry, with the road leading from Mechanicsville to the C. H. 7 ms. from Aylett's, 4½ from Newcastle ferry, 10 ms. from the C. H. and 5 from Mechanicsville.—It has an excellent tavern, a grocery, and gig maker. Enfield, P. O. 108 ms. from W. 36 from R., and about 300 yds from Mechanicsville, and 3½ ms. from Dabney's ferry, on the road leading from that ferry to Aylett's. It contains 2 stores, a blacksmith, shoemaker, cabinet maker, saddler and harne's maker, and a carpenters shop. Green Mount, P. O. 33 ms. from R. and 104 ms. from W. KING WILLIAM C. H., 27 ms. N. E. of R., and 120 W. of S. from W.

It contains, besides the usual county buildings, 8 dwelling houses, several mechanic shops, and 1 mercantile store. Some of the lots and buildings present a state of high improvement, and tasteful management, especially the public lots and buildings, consisting of a C. H., Clerk's office, and 2 jails—all constructed of brick, and handsomely inclosed with an iron railing. The lot is laid off in a square which is beautifully set with grass, and shaded by a grove of locust trees. Population 75 persons, of whom 1 is an attorney, and 2 are regular physicians. County Courts are held on the 4th Monday in every month.—Quarterly in March, May, August and November. Judge Semple holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 1st of April and September. Lanesville, P. O. 7 ms. below the C. H., has 2 stores, and several mechanics. Mangohick, P. O. 102 ms. from W., and 40 from R. There is here a store, blacksmith shop, gig maker, shoemaker, and tailor's shop. Distant 10 ms. from Aylett's. Piping Tree, P. V. 20 ms. N. E. of R., and 127 from W., situated on the Pamunkey river, 10 ms. S. of Aylett's, though called a village, yet it is not remarkable for any thing more than a comfortable tavern house and ferry on the road leading direct to R. Rumford Academy, P. O., 115 ms. a little S. of W. from W., and 32 N. E. of R., situated on Mattapony river, 6 ms. below Aylett's, and 6 ms. above the C. H. The mail arrives twice a week. (See above in description of the county.) LANCASTER. Lancaster was created by the legislature in 1652;—we are not informed from what county it was taken. It is bounded N. by Richmond and Northumberland counties, E. by Northumberland, and the Chesapeake, S. and W. by the Rappahannock river, which separates it from Middlesex. Its length is 24 ms., mean breadth 8, and area 300 sq. ms., and it extends in lat. from 27° 35′, to 37° 55′ N., and in long from 0° 22′, to 0° 40′ E. of W. C. It is deeply indented on its Rappahannock border with several small but very convenient bays. Population in 1820, 5,517—in 1830, 4,801. It belongs to the 5th judicial circuit and 3d district. Tax paid in 1832-3, $971 25—in 1833-4, on land, $462 86—1,385 slaves, $346 25—638 horses, $38 28— 2 studs, $16 00—29 coaches, $60 00—7 carryalls, $7 00—108 gigs, $59 40. Total, $989 79. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $117 90. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. LANCASTER C. H., P. V., situated near the centre of the county, 83 ms. N. E. of R., and 145 ms. S S. E. of W. Besides the usual county buildings, it contains about 30 dwelling houses, 3 mercantile stores, and 1 tavern. Various mechanical pursuits are carried on. Population 80 persons; of whom 1 is an attorney, and 1 a physician. County Courts are held on the 3rd Monday in every month.—Quarterly in March, May, August and November. Judge Lomax holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery, on the 25th of May, and 28th of October. Kilmarnock, P. V. situated on a small creek of Chesapeake bay, 90 ms. N. E. by E. of R., and 153 ms. from W., about 16 ms. N. of the mouth of Rappahannock river, and 1½ ms. from the navigable waters of Chesapeake bay. It contains 40 dwelling houses, 3 mercantile stores, and 1 tavern. Various mechanical pursuits are carried on; and in the neighbourhood in different directions, are 4 houses of public worship, 1 Episcopalian, 1 Baptist, and 2 Methodist. Population 130 persons; of whom 1 is a physician. Nuttsville, P. V. in the northern part of the county, 138 ms. S. S. E. of W., and 76 N. E. by E. of R., situated 7 ms. above Lancaster C. H., in a N. W. direction, and about 2 ms. from the Rappahannock river. This place was established 35 or 40 years since, by a person by the name of Wm. D. Nutt, (hence Nuttsville) and the Post Office was located here in 1818. It has 2 dwelling houses, 1 country store, a blacksmith and tailor shop. Pain's Roads, P. O. 52 ms. from W., and 72 ms. from R., situated between the Rappahannock, and Carrotoman rivers, 15 ms. from the mouth of the former, and 5 ms. from the mouth of the latter. In the neck called Carrotoman, which runs N. and S. for the distance of 10 ms. between those 2 rivers. Some 8 or 10 years back, this was a place of considerable trade, but at present, it contains only 4 or 5 dwelling houses, a school, a Baptist meeting house, and 2 boot and shoe factories. Population 40. The soil is fertile, producing well. The principal crops are wheat, Indian corn, and cotton. Though situated between 2 large commercial rivers, not more than 1 mile from either, the view is entirely obstructed by an immense growth of oak, and pine woods, an article of considerable value in the trade of this section of country. LOUDOUN. Loudoun was created by the Legislature in the year 1757, and formed from a part of Fairfax county. It is bounded on the N. by the Potomac, which separates it from Frederick county, Maryland, and on the N. E. by the same river, separating it from Montgomery county, Md.,—E. by Fairfax,—S. by Prince William and Fauquier,—and W. by the Blue Ridge which separates it from Frederick and Jefferson counties. Its length is from S. E. to N. W. 22 miles, mean breadth 21, and area 468 square miles; and it extends in lat. from 38° 42′ to 39° 18′ N. and in long. from 0° 20′ to 0° 54′ W. of W. C. The most prominent feature of this county is its ranges of mountains. The blue Ridge divides this county from Frederick and Jefferson, the line running on the summit. It presents here that uniformity and general appearance, which characterizes it, throughout this State, having gaps or depressions every eight or ten miles, through which the public roads pass. Its altitude here varies from about 1000 to 1400 feet above tide water, and from 300 to 700 feet above the adjacent country; and its course is about S. S. W. Another range of nearly equal height, and similar features, called the Short Hills commences at the Potomac river about 4 miles below Harper's Ferry, running parallel to the ridge and extending about 9 miles into the county, where it is broken by a branch of Kittoctan Creek passing through it; beyond which it immediately rises again, and extends about 3 miles further, where it abruptly terminates. A third range called the Kittoctan mountain commences at the Potomac river, opposite the Point of Rocks in Maryland, about 12 miles below Harper's Ferry, and runs parallel to the Blue Ridge, nearly through the county; and forms a valley of about 10 miles wide, from the northern to the southern boundary of the county. This mountain does not probably exceed an average of more than 300 feet above the surrounding country, though some of its peaks may attain an altitude of 600 feet. It rises near the Potomac into one of its highest peaks, and in the same range becomes alternately depressed and elevated several times, until it reaches the neighborhood of Waterford, where it divides itself into several branches, and presents the appearance of an elevated and hilly country, deeply indented by the severals streams that rises in its bosom. On reaching the Leesburg and Snicker's Gap turnpike road, a distance of 11 or 12 miles, it expands to 3 miles in width, and continues much the same until after it is broken by Goose Creek, and its tributary the N. W. Fork, when it gradually loses itself in the hills of Goose Creek and Little river, before reaching the Ashby's Gap turnpike. Immediately S. of Aldie on Little river, another range commences called the Bull Run mountain, and extends in a single range into Fauquier county. This range might properly be considered a continuation of the easternmost range of the Kittoctan, as its course and some of its features correspond very nearly with it, save only that it is higher than any of the ranges of the latter, except the western. No range of mountains or even hills of much elevation exists E. of the Kittoctan, that being the first range met with above tide water. Three or four detached hills, with an elevation of 100 or 200 feet above the adjacent country, are on the waters of the N. W. Fork of Goose Creek, and are all that are deemed worthy of notice. It may be perceived, on reference to the map, by the course of the waters, that the general slope of the county is to the N. E. The streams that rise in the Blue Ridge mostly run to the E., until they approach the Kittoctan mountain, where they either turn more to the N. or S. to pass that range by the N. W. Fork and Goose Creek, or by the Kittoctan creek that falls into the Potomac, above the Point of Rocks. E. of the Kittoctan mountain the streams generally pursue a N. course. The Kittoctan creek is very crooked, its basin does not exceed about 12 miles from N. to S. and includes the whole width of the valley between the mountains, except a small portion in the N. E. angle of the county; and yet its whole course measuring its meanders would exceed 35 miles in length; and it has a fall of 180 feet in the last 18 miles of its course, and is about 20 yards wide near its mouth. Goose Creek where it enters the county from Fauquier, is a considerable stream and pursues generally a N. E. course, and receives many small streams, until it passes the first range of the Kittoctan mountain, where it receives a large tributary, the N. W. Fork. The latter stream rises in the Blue Ridge, and pursues a S. E. course, and unites with the Beaver Dam, coming from the S. W. immediately above the Kittoctan mountain, where their united waters pass by a narrow valley to Goose Creek. After receiving the N. W. Fork, the main stream pursues generally an E. N. E. course for a few miles further, where it receives the Little river from the S. This stream rises in Fauquier county W. of the Bull Run mountain, and enters this county a few miles above Aldie, and pursues a N. and N. E. course until after passing that town, when it turns more northwardly and falls into Goose Creek. The now increased stream meanders a little more to the N. E. and N. and finally falls into the Potomac, 4 miles N. E. of Leesburg. Its length in this county is about 30 miles, and it has a fall of 100 feet, in the last 22 miles of its course. It drains nearly one half of the county, and is about 60 yards wide at its mouth. Broad Run the next stream of consequence, E. of Goose Creek, rises in Prince William county, and pursues a N. course with some meanderings through this county, and falls into the Potomac about 4 miles below the mouth of Goose Creek. Sugar Land run, a smaller stream, rises partly in this county, though its course is chiefly in Fairfax county, and falls into the Potomac at the N. E. angle of this county. In the S. E. angle of the county several streams rise and pursue a S. and S. E. course, and constitute some of the upper branches of Occoquan river. This county is not rich in minerals, though there are some small indications of Iron ore in several places. A furnace formerly existed at the E. base of the Kittoctan mountain, on the margin of the Potomac river, but has been out of blast for a good many years, owing to the scarcity of fuel. The ore in the vicinity is said to be abundant, and the water power there used was obtained from the Kittoctan creek, W. of the mountain, by excavating a tunnel through one of its spurs, 500 feet through the rock and 60 feet below the surface of the hill. Magnetic iron ore has been found in some places, and that, or some other similar substance, has an effect upon the needle of the surveyor's compass, and renders surveying very difficult where great accuracy is required. In some instances the needle has been known to be drawn 7° from its true course. This effect is more or less observed nearly throughout the Kittoctan mountain, and in many other places in the county. In one place it is said that silver has been obtained in small quantity, and in another place there is an indication of copper ore, but whether sufficiently rich to justify working, remains to be tested. Small angular lumps of a yellowish colored substance have been found in a few places, embedded in rock, and supposed to contain sulphur, from the strong sulphurous smell given out on its being exposed to a strong heat. Limestone has not been found in many places near the surface of the ground in this county. It is found in Digg's valley and some other places, and quarries are worked N. E. of Waterford, on the E. side of the Black Oak Ridge, and at the base of the Kittoctan mountain, where Goose Creek first approaches it. Near the latter place, marble is found of an excellent quality, but has not been worked much. In the vicinity of Leesburg and N. of it, and between the Kittoctan mountain and the Potomac river, a colcareous rock is found in abundance, apparently formed of pebbles cemented together, and similar in formation to that used for the pillars of the Representatives Hall in the Capitol at Washington, and commonly known as the Potomac marble; when burnt it produces an inferior lime. There are several mineral springs in the county of the class called Chalybeate, and several springs and wells that are affected with lime. Many varieties of stone are found in this county, among which are granite very abundant, horne blende, gneiss, quartz, and as before observed, limestone and marble. Much of it however, on or near the surface, appears to be a variety of granite and horne blende. The latter kind is frequently 27 found in round or oval masses, and in that form it is almost impossible to break it. White flint is met with frequently, and blue flint occasionally, throughout the county, on or near the surface, but seldom in large masses or deep in the ground. Small pointed stones of different kinds of flint, and supposed to be Indian darts, are occasionally found, as also some rare varieties of stones, of a singular form, and exhibiting some curious phenomena. Some few years ago, a stonemason broke a stone on the Kittoctan mountain, and found it to contain a shell resembling an oyster shell filled with sand petrified. The different strata of rocks and earth, throughout the county, have a direction parallel with the mountain, and an elevated position inclining to the west, evidently shewing some general cause in their formation. Perhaps no county in the State is better watered for all purposes except manufacturing in times of drought. The springs are generally small and very numerous, and many of them are very lasting tho' liable to be effected by drought. In such cases by absorption, and evaporation, the small streams are frequently exhausted before uniting and render the larger ones too light for manufacturing purposes. Many of our farms might be divided into fields of ten acres each and have running water in each of them in ordinary seasons. But one spring in the county is large enough to turn a mill, and that is near Leesburg, on which is a large merchant mill capable of manufacturg 75000 bushels of wheat in a year. The most common growth of timber found here, is the white, black, Spanish, red, and box oak; hickory and green maple; white and yellow poplar; black and white walnut, ash, sassafras, dogwood, chesnut, and chesnut oak on the mountains, peach oak (so called from the resemblance of its leaves to that of the peach tree;) in low grounds and near the margin of streams, is the sycamore, red, and slippery elm, birch and some beech; the persimmon, black and red haw or white thorn is common and the Virginia thorn, suitable for hedging, is found in the eastern part of the county. Common locust is found in part of the county; the quaking asp is occasionally met with, and so is the yellow pine; and on some of the cliffs of Goose Creek and Beaver Dam, the hemlock or spruce pine is to be found. The wild May cherry or service berry, the witch hazel, fringe tree, red bud, papaw and spicewood are not uncommon. Three varieties of the large grape commonly called fox grape, and several kinds of lesser grapes, are found here, and were formerly very common. Almost every kind of fruit common to this climate succeeds well, especially apples, peaches, cherries, plums, quinces and grapes: the farmers generally are very remiss in improving their orchards by selecting good fruit, but lately more attention has been paid to that subject and the good effects are becoming visible. This county contains all the varieties of soil, from a rich alluvian to that of an unproductive clay. That part of it lying E. of a line drawn from the Potomac river near Leesburg by Aldie to the Fauquier line, is much more unproductive than that part to the W. partly on account of an inferior soil, and partly in consequence of that wretched system of farming hitherto too much practised in Virginia, of cropping with corn and tobacco, without endeavoring to improve the quality of the soil. Some of it that formerly produced 30 or 40 bushels of corn to the acre is now thrown out to the commons, and considered useless. A good deal of this part of the county is very level, and has a clay soil, and is more productive in grass than grain. The other section or about three-fourths of the county has generally a good soil, and is very susceptilbe of improvement. The quality of the grain is good. Gypsum, or plaster of Paris, and clover act wonderfully in improving the soil, as well as barnyard manures. The staple articles are flour, wheat, pork and beef. Most of the wheat is manufactured into flour in the county, and the rye, corn, oats, and buckwheat is mostly consumed at home. Much excellent pork is fattened in this county, and many hundred head of cattle are annually grazed to supply the Baltimore and District markets. All kinds of vegetables common to this climate succeed well. The citizens of this county are characterized by a commendable spirit of internal improvement. A charter has been obtained and some subscriptions towards forming a company to improve the navigation of Goose Creek and some of its tributaries by a lock and dam system, and a charter also to form a company to make a rail road from the mouth of the Kittoctan creek opposite the Point of Rocks in Maryland, to Upperville in Fauquier county. A very considerable contrast is observable in the manners of the inhabitants in different sections of the county. That part of it lying N. W. of Waterford was originally settled principally by Germans, and is now called the German settlement, and the middle of the county S. W. of Waterford and W. of Leesburg, was mostly settled by emigrants from the middle States, many of whom were members of the society of Friends. In these two sections the farms are generally from one to three hundred acres each and are mostly cultivated by free labor. In the S. and E. parts of the county the farms are many of them much larger and principally cultivated by slave labor. Very extensive prospects may be seen on some of the summits of the Blue Ridge. From the east side nearly all Loudoun, with a good deal of Fairfax and Fauquier, is in full view, also a considerable part of Culpeper, and Prince William counties in this State, with Frederick and Montgomery counties of Maryland, and even some of Prince George county E. of Washington City. From the W. side of the summits may be seen Shenandoah, Frederick, Berkley, and Jefferson counties in this State—with Washington county, Maryland, and some of the mountain summits of Pennsylvania. Population in 1820, 22,702—in 1830, 21,939. This county belongs to the sixth judicial circuit and third district.

It is situated nearly in the centre of this fertile and wealthy county, on the Kittoctan Mountain, at the intersection of two public roads, one leading from Snickers Gap to Alexandria— the other through a line of towns from the S. to Philadelphia. The site of this village is a beautiful eminence, which rises to a moderate height, in a wide gap, or opening in the mountain. From the bleak winds of the north it is protected, by a much higher summit of the same mountain. The prospect from this place is most varied and extensive. To the E. and S. is a beautiful rolling mountainous country. But it is on the W. side of the village that the curious may behold the finest scenery in nature. Here a valley opens to view about 10 ms. wide, extending between the Kittoctan, and Blue mountains as far as the eye can reach; diversified by hills and dales, fields and forests it is equalled only in scenery of romantic grandeur and sublimity, by the distant mountains which border it. Here, also, being the lower part of the mountain, is the natural as well as artificial passage to mill, market, court, &amp;c. for the citizens of the surrounding country. Combining so many natural advantages, this place was purchased by the present proprietor in 1821.— It has since been laid out for a town, 22 lots have been disposed of, and 10 dwelling houses are in different stages of progression. The ground plot of the town consists of 3 parallel streets, 2 of which are more than ½ a mile long, intersected by 8 other streets at right angles. The distance from Leesburg, Middleburg, Union, and Aldie, is respectively about 8 ms. and as those are the nearest towns it has to compete with, considering the density of the population, and the productiveness of the country, it is calculated that two good establishments of every kind of business would be well supported here. And the superior healthiness of the place will ensure to tradesmen and mechanics the greatest advantages; to boarding school and infirmary institutions the most eligible situation. It contains at present 1 mercantile store, 1 handsome school house built expressly for the purpose, and the Methodist society hold their meetings for worship therein; an infirmary, which is an infant institution intended for the restoration of persons laboring under chronic diseases, and which has been attended with unusual success,—2 boot and shoe factories, 1 cooper's shop, 2 cabinet makers; and in the vicinity there is a large and spacious house of public worship (Baptist). This place must rise in importance as it is located in a healthy, fertile district; a canal or slack water navigation is about to be constructed on Goose creek, 1 branch of which will terminate within less than a mile of the corporation. Population 62 persons; of whom 1 is a practising physician. Montville, P. O. 46 ms. N. W. of W. and 154 ms. from R., situated upon the Snicker's Gap turnpike road, distant 1½ ms. both from the waters of Goose creek, and Beaver Dam. There is over the latter, an excellent one arch stone bridge, and over the former, a superior wooden arched bridge. Montville contains several dwelling houses, 1 mercantile store, 2 taverns, 1 manufacturing flour mill, 2 smith shops, 2 boot and shoe factories, and various other mechanics. Population 71. The land in this neighborhood is remarkably good, and is valued in market at 35 and 40 dollars an acre. The principal pursuit of the inhabitants, is agriculture,—cattle grazing is also followed to some extent. There are several quarries in the neighborhood, 1 called Mounts quarry is of superior whetstone, and situated on the banks of Goose creek; near which there are very strong indications of slate. The neighborhood abounds with lime of the best quality, and various other minerals. Noland's Ferry, P. O. 43 ms. N. W. of W., and 165 from R. The P. O. is situated a little above the mouth of Monocacy river. Oatland Mills, P. O. 37 ms. N. W. of W. and 154 from R. But for its locality, this P. O. would deserve no further notice than is taken in this work of many others of the same importance: but although of little account, in point of revenue, it is of great utility to a populous neighborhood, and furnishes one of the desiderata for this Gazetteer, as the large body of land which is included in the Oatland tract, affords a tolerable criterion of the soil for some miles N. and S. of it. Bordering on the Kittoctan mountain, the soil is stiff and stony, except such as is adjacent to water courses, or the base of hills, where it receives the benefit of large supplies of decayed matter, rendering it loamy and inexhaustible, but in the main, it is of a generous quality, receiving plaister and clover as its staple manure, which it so pertinaciously retains, as to defy the washing of the heaviest rains; and still it is an anomaly, that some of the richest portions of this soil will not produce wheat—while rye, oats, and corn, seldom fail to equal the most sanguine hopes of the cultivator. There is, perhaps, no section of country E. of the Blue Ridge, which better deserves the appellation of pasture land, than this; for there are very few parcels where the white clover does not grow spontaneously in the greatest abundance. In this section of country nature has been sparing of her mineralogical favors. Iron ore is found in some places, but neither so rich or abundant as to cause it to be worked. Marble, such as the shores of the Potomac abound with, is scattered in shallow strata, but is also unworthy of attention. Lime stone is obtained in the greatest abundance, and is well adapted, as a manure, to the soil. The Oatland Mills consist of a set of merchant stones, capable of grinding 40 barrels of flour per day,—a pair of country stones, and another for plaister,—with an oil mill and 2 wool carding machines, all under different roofs, but in buildings so closely connected as to combine the convenience of a single one,—there is also a saw mill adjacent; all of which are worked by Goose creek, a bold stream emptying into the Potomac river, 12 ms. below. Across this creek, a few rods from the mills, is an excellent bridge of 120 feet span, lately erected at the cost of the county. Through the indefatigable zeal of the Honorable C. F. Mercer, a topographical survey of Goose creek has recently been made, with a view of rendering it navigable by a canal, intersecting the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal; and an estimate of the probable cost, also made, which will not exceed $30,000,—a part of this sum has been subscribed by persons in the immediate neighborhood, and a hope is entertained, that the residue will be taken by the District of Columbia, to secure the vast amount of produce which must otherwise find a market at Baltimore by way of the Rail road. Philmont, P. V. 41 ms. from W. and 163 from R., situated on the Snickersville turnpike road, 12 ms. S. of Leesburg, the County Seat, 10 ms. from Snicker's ferry, 42 ms. from Alexandria. It contains 6 dwelling houses, 1 common school, 1 mercantile store, and 2 saddlers. The country around is fertile and wealthy, settled for the most part by Quakers. Wheat is the principal article produced. Purcell's Store, P. O. 41 ms. N. W. of W., and 163 ms. from R. Roseville, 38 ms. from W. and 146 ms. from R. Snickersville, P. V. in the western part of the county, 49 ms. W. of W., and 165 from R. This is a thriving and healthy village, advantageously situated at the south eastern base of the Blue Ridge mountain, in the midst of a densely populated and business-like neighborhood. It contains 16 dwelling houses, 1 house of public worship, free for all denominations, 1 common school, 1 Masonic hall, 2 taverns, 2 mercantile stores, 2 boot and shoe factories, 1 tailor, 1 wagon maker, 3 blacksmiths, and 1 copper and tin plate worker. This section of the county is remarkable for the fertility and productiveness of its soil. A good turnpike from Winchester to Alexandria, passes through it, and intersects at the former place with one from Washington to Winchester, which passes through Leesburg. An excellent line of stages which extends from Washington to Cumberland, in Indiana, passes thro' this village, Winchester and Leesburg. Six mails a week are received at the P. O. Population 98 persons; of whom 1 is an attorney, and 2 are practising physicians. Upperville,* * This post village has by some accident got transposed—it ought to have been in Fauquier Co. P. V. in the extreme south western end of Loudoun, 54 ms. W. of W., and 135 ms. from R., situated on the Ashby's Gap turnpike road, between Winchester and Alexandria, distant 23 ms. both from Leesburg and Warrenton, not more than 200 yards from the Fauquier line, and 3 ms. from the Blue Ridge. It contains 64 dwelling houses, 3 mercantile stores, 2 taverns and 1 hotel, 1 manufacturing flour mill, 3 houses of public worship, 1 Baptist, 1 Methodist, and 1 free for all denominations, and another is now being erected by the Episcopalians,—1 Academy, in which the languages are taught, and 1 common school. The mechanics are, a tanner, hatter, 3 boot and shoe manufacturers, 2 mill wrights, 1 saddler, 2 house joiners, 1 tin plate worker, 1 bricklayer, 2 stone masons, and 2 plasterers. Upperville is surrounded by a very populous and fertile country, remarkably well watered, and the land adapted to the growth of corn and wheat, and to grazing, which last is extensively carried on. This place is distant from Alexandria, 46 ms., and 54 from W., and its produce is principally carried to the former. Should the contemplated improvement of the navigation of Goose creek go into operation, it will afford an easier mode of transportation, and add greatly to the wealth, and industry of this neighborhood, giving the former a choice of markets, besides lessening by more than one half, the expense of transportation. Population 300 persons; of whom 1 is an attorney, and 2 are regular physicians. Union, P. V. in the western angle of the county, 51 ms. N. W. of W., and 173 ms. from R. It contains 25 dwelling houses, 3 houses of public worship, 1 of which belongs to the Methodist denomination, and the other 2 are free for all, 1 common school, 2 mercantile stores, 1 tavern, a carding machine worked by horse power, and to which there is also attached a pair of burr stones. There are 1 temperance society and various mechanical pursuits. The situation is healthy, in a thickly settled neighbourhood, 16 ms. from Leesburg, and equi-distant from Middleburg, Upperville and Snickersville. Population 135 persons; of whom 1 is an attorney, and 3 are regular physicians. Waterford, P. V. in the northern part of the county, 37 ms. N. W. of W. C., and 159 ms. from R. Waterford is a fine flourishing little village, situated 6 ms. N. W. of Leesburg, the County Seat, on the Kittoctan creek. The land is equal to any in the state of Virginia, admirably adapted to clover and plaister, and is excellent wheat and corn land, which two articles are the staple productions of the county. Waterford contains 70 dwelling houses, 2 houses of public worship, 1 free for all denominations, the other a Friends' meeting house, 6 mercantile stores, 2 free schools, 4 taverns, 1 manufacturing flour mill, and 1 saw, grist and plaister mill, and (in the vicinity) 2 small cotton manufactories. The mechanics are 1 tanner, 2 house joiners, 2 cabinet makers, 1 chair maker and painter, 1 boot and shoe manufacturers, 2 hatters, 1 tailor, &amp;c. Population about 400 persons; of whom 3 are regular physicians. Wood Grove, P. O. in the northern part of the county, 44 ms. N. W. of W., and 166 ms. from R. LOUISA. Louisa was created by the Legislature in 1742, and was taken from the upper portion of Hanover county. It is bounded N. by Orange and Spottsylvania—N. E. by Spottsylvania,—E. by Hanover,—S. by Goochland and Fluvanna, and W. by Albemarle. Situated between 37° 45′ and 38° 6′ N. lat., and between 0° 42′ and 1° 17′ W. long. from Washington. This county is near the centre of Virginia and near the centre of the region between tidewater and the Blue Ridge. Its mean length is from the line of Albemarle to that of Hanover, 30 miles: its mean breadth, from the upper part of Goochland to that of Spottsylvania, 18 miles: area 550 sq. miles. Water Courses.—The South Anna, an arm of the Pamunky, runs forty miles through this county in a S. E. direction. On the Orange and Spottsylvania line, the North Anna runs an equal distance, bounding Louisa on the N. and N. E. Little river, and Newfound river, rise in Louisa, and having entered Hanover, run, the former into the North-Anna, the latter into the South-Anna. Hopes are entertained of rendering all these navigable to some extent: the South-Anna to the upper part of the county, within 10 miles of its source; and the North-Anna nearly as high. There are 35 rivulets, (here called creeks:) of which 24 are tributary to the North-Anna, 10 to the South-Anna, and one to Little river. Soil, products, face of the country, minerals, &amp;c.—The soil was originally of at least middling fertility: but by every species of mismanagement (amid which over-cropping, frequent grazing, bad ploughing, scanty manuring, and the culture of tobacco, stand conspicuous,) it has become pitiably barren. On high land six bushels of wheat, or ten of Indian corn, are the average product of an acre. Wheat yields about 3½ or 4 bushels to one of seed. The chief agricultural products are wheat, maize (or Indian corn) and tobacco: the last is diminishing in quantity every year; owing more to the exhaustion of the lands suitable to its growth, than to a persuasion of its 28 impoverishing tendencies. The forest land is covered with oak of several kinds, hickory, poplar, gum, maple, dogwood, and especially with yellow pine. The most usual undergrowth is chinquepin, and sometimes whortleberry. When the soil is exhausted by cultivation, and suffered to lie idle, it shoots up thickets of yellow pine; which in 15 or 20 years form a cover, that affords a means of restoring the soil. There are no mountains. The ground is hilly, or rolling: a circumstance combining with injudicious ploughing, and with the light, sandy texture of the soil, to accelerate its impoverishment. Every hard rain sweeps off much of the richest earth. Towards the upper part of the county is a singular tract of country, of about 8 or 10,000 acres, called "Green Spring land," (from the mineral spring of that name situated in it.) This tract lies in an irregular circle, of from four to six miles diameter: and far exceeds all other high land in the county, both in native fertility, and in susceptibility of improvement. Its soil is a dark grey, containing very little sand, or stone of any kind; and resting, at a depth of 12 or 15 inches, upon a stratum of compact, firm, red clay, scarcely penetrable by water. Thus the "Green-Spring land" avoids the two great characteristic defects of Louisa land—too large an intermixture of sand, and a too gritty and porous foundation. It is particularly suited to wheat; yielding 8 or 10 bushels to one of seed, without manure; and capable of being made to yield 15, 20, or 30 to one. This oasis is not heavily timbered its oak and hickory are rather stinted: it has little or no pine; and a good deal of black-jack—elsewhere a symptom of sterility. The "Green-Spring" water is impregnated chiefly or wholly with sulphur and magnesia, forming a mild sulphate of magnesia (Epsom salts.) It has been ascertained to have no iron. This water was once in high vogue, and much resorted to by invalids and people of fashion. But the accommodations for company have now, for 25 or 30 years, been discontinued; and visitors are compelled to throw themselves upon the hospitality of the neighborhood. The water is deemed good for dyspepsia, affections of the liver and lungs, and several other complaints. This spring is situated in the upper part of the county 60 miles from Richmond, 18 from Louisa C. H., and 25 from Charlottesville. Since the death of the former proprietor (Col. Morris) the place has gone to decay. There were several spacious buildings for the reception of visitors, but some have been consumed by fire, some have fallen down, and only a few houses in a state of rapid decay remain. The issue of the spring is small, but the stream runs constantly and with force. The water is clear and transparent, but quite unpleasant to the taste. Gold has, within two years past, been found abundantly in Louisa. Through the heart of the county, runs that belt of gold land which pervades Virginia, Carolina, and Georgia in a direction nearly from N. E. to S. W. (viz. S. 49° 30′ W.). Its breadth here is from 1 to 3 miles. No vein has yet been profitably worked. The richest deposites have been found upon Contrary creek, in the northern part of the county. The ordinary depth at which these are found, is from one to four feet; and none deeper than 12 feet. In one of them (called "Tinder's mine") at the depth of 10 or 12 feet, the value of about $20,000 has been found, and near $10,000 of this were obtained within six days, in November, 1833, by about 25 hands. There are nine deposites on or near the creek just mentioned, which have been more or less worked, and altogether have yielded near $40,000. Contiguous to one of them, (Walton's) a promising vein of rich ore has been opened, by a perpendicular shaft of 50 feet, and then a horizontal tunnel of 10 or 12 feet. This is the only instance in Louisa of a vein wrought upon scientific principles. Towards the S. W. part of the county, also, promising indications both of deposites and veins have been found: but none of them have been extensively wrought. The usual indicia of vein-gold are cellated quartz, with talcose slate, sulphuret (or pyrites) of iron, &amp;c. The deposites (which are thought to be broken down or partially decomposed veins) are indicated commonly by the same signs; and are usually in quartzose strata (or layers,) 6, 10, or 12 inches thick; resting upon beds of slate. The apparatus for obtaining deposite gold is very simple and cheap: consisting (besides the digging tools) of a small stream of water; a sort of trough called a rocker, in which the earth is shaken in water, to separate it from the gold; a few tin-pans, and some quicksilver, to collect the fine particles of gold by its attraction. At the mines on Contrary, one hand ordinarily obtains from one to five dwt. per day. One dwt. to the hand is considered profitable. There were from 60 to 70 hands employed in the county, on an average, during the year 1833, in searching for gold. Several mining companies having now been chartered by the Legislature, much more capital and labor will doubtless soon be employed. Iron ore is plentiful through the gold region. It was partially wrought before the Revolution, to supply a furnace in Spottsylvania: and might be worked to advantage now, were not wood scarce in the vicinity. Graphite, or carburet of iron, (improperly called black lead,) has been found in considerable quantities on the eastern branch of Contrary and on Cub creek; the former 2 or 3 miles and the latter 6 or 7 miles below the gold region. A range of granite from 5 to 8 miles wide, extends nearly across the county in much the same direction as the gold range, and in part coinciding with it; though generally the granite lies higher up the country, tapering off in the form of an ellipse, 6 or 8 miles to the S. W. of the Court House. Good millstones have been made of this rock. It is intermixed with the coarser and less pure granite, called gneiss. The rest of the county, without the granite region, is of the secondary formation; chiefly slate, with quartz, mica, and some gneiss. Yet granite occasionally appears miles distant from the range just described. On the eastearn or rather south-eastern edge of the granite formation, about 5 miles N. E. of Louisa C. H., is a quarry of stone novaculite or Virginia oil-stone, highly valued for whet-stones. This quarry is a seam, or vein, 50 or 60 feet long and of unknown depth, in the centre of a peculiar formation, which extends for three-quarters of a mile in length, by a half-a-mile in breadth, partly within and partly without the granite range. The Virginia oilstone is exquisitely fine, and free from grit, yet sufficiently soft.* * This valuable wherstone is now brought into market in large quantities by the proprieters, Messrs. Colman, Raymond &amp; Keller, Richmond. It has spread extensively over the United States, and been sent to Europe. It is composed of feldtzpar, chrystallized silex, and sometimes hornblend, (three of the four elements of granite.) Another whetstone quarry is ten miles S. of Louisa C. H., near what is called the Rack-punch, or Arrack-punch spring: but this is coarse compared with the former, being a sort of sandstone. Population in-1830; 16,151, or 29 to the square mile. The following table shews the population, and its three comparative classes, at the three last enumerations. Years. Whites. Slaves. Free Col'd people.

The following table shews at what rate per cent the whole population and each of its three classes, have increased, both during the whole 20 years preceding the last census, and during each half of that period: Periods. In. of Whites. per cent. In. of Slaves. per cent. In. Fr. Col'd. per cent. In. whole pop. per cent.

None of them can pretend to elegance or grandeur; for the greater number is of one story, and wooden, either framed or made with logs. Scarcely 20 are made of brick: and even painting is rare. Trades, occupations, &amp;c.—Louisa contains 15 regular practising physicians, 4 lawyers, 12 ministers of the gospel (all of whom, however, have other pursuits also;) 4 saddler's shops, 14 tanneries, 3 carriage maker's shops, 5 tailors' shops, 1 silversmith, about 30 grist mills, at several of which good wheat-flour is made, and occasionally for the Richmond market. There is no cotton or woollen manufactory; but there are several machines for picking cotton and carding wool. The great mass of the population is agricultural. There are about 20 stores where merchandize is sold. Religion and morals.—The county contains about 2960 professing christians, viz. 1450 Baptists, 1340 Methodists, 140 Reformed Baptists, 20 Presbyterians, and 10 Episcopalians. Houses of worship, 25, besides two stations, or permanent camps, for camp-meetings. These rural churches are of the plainest structure, usually framed of scantling, merely shingled and weatherboarded, without ceiling or plastering on the inside; and costing from 150 to 450 dollars. The people in general are of moral and industrious habits. They have been noted for their simplicity in dress and equipage: what is called Virginia-cloth being more frequently worn by them, than in most of the neighboring counties. There are 13 temperance societies in the county, comprising altogether about 1200 members. There is a female colonization society, and several Bible, Tract, Missionary, and Sunday school societies. Schools, state of learning, &amp;c.—There is but one permanent classical school in Louisa. There are several for teaching the plainer branches of knowledge; and three female boarding schools. The county has usually furnished about 5 students annually to the University of Virginia. Pauper system.—Until 1832 the poor were maintained at their own houses, or in the houses of their friends, by a specific sum yearly allotted to each by the overseers of the poor. This sum was usually so squandered or misapplied, as to produce not more than half the due amount of comfort and relief to the pauper: while at the same time many who were not proper objects of charity, palmed themselves as such upon the overseers. From both these causes, the poor tax arose to double its necessary or proper amount. In 1818 it was 35 cents on each tithable person; in 1828, 54 cents: in 1829, 55 cents; and in 1831, 62 cents. In 14 years its whole amount had risen from $1615 to $3502; and this by such steady and regular strides as shewed a likelihood of continued advances. Alarmed at so rapid an increase of the burthen, the county court resolved, as a means of checking it, to establish a Poor House. In 1831, about 200 acres of land were purchased, with a neat two-story brick house and some useful outhouses; to which several others were added at the county charge. The whole, cost less than $2000. The poor, who chose to receive parish aid, were brought to the institution in January, 1832: it being determined that relief should be afforded to none out of the Poor House. A superintendent, discreet, trusty, and kind, is employed for $200 per annum, and a small supply of meat and corn to his family. The inmates at the time this article was written were 29. They are well fed, clothed, and lodged; and more comfortable in all respects than they could be under the former system. The tax for their support on each tythable person in 1832, was reduced to 35 cents, and in 1833, to 13 cents. Formerly the number of paupers ranged from 50 to 90; costing the public, on an average, about $38 or $40 each. The present average is less than $26 each. Such as are able, labor upon the farm attached to the establishment; and the females, who cannot work without doors, have cotton and wool furnished them to card and spin. History, civil and political condition.—Louisa was laid off as a county (taken from the upper part of Hanover,) by an act of the General Assembly in May, 1742, and named after a princess of the royal family of Great Britain. In 1761 a portion was cut off from its upper end and added to Albemarle; leaving the boundaries of Louisa as they now stand. This county has been the scene of no important historical incident. Its citizens bore their full share in the Indian and French war of 1755, and in the war of the Revolution. Tarlton, with his cavalry, passed up by the Court House in 1781 on his expedition to Albemarle: and when La Fayette had united with Wayne at the Racoon Ford on the Rapidan, and turned to pursue the British general from whom he had been retreating, he made a forced and rapid march across this county, from Brock's Bridge on the North-Anna to the Fluvanna line, in order to intercept the enemy. The road which he opened for this purpose is still known as "the Marquis's road;" passing southwesterly 3 or 4 miles above the Green Spring. In the same year, two tories who had attached themselves as marauders to the British army, were summarily hung by one Holland and another man, near the Goochland boundary, 21 miles S. from Louisa C. H., with the countenance and before the eyes, of 20 or 30 of the neighboring people. Louisa has produced no very distinguished men. Yet she first sent Patrick Henry as a delegate to the House of Burgesses in 1765, soon after his removal from Hanover; and she again elected him in 1776 and '7, till he returned to his native county. Since the extension of the right of suffrage in 1830, there are about 900 persons qualified to vote: but not even 800 have ever actually voted; and the usual number polled is 5 or 600. There are two places of voting, or "election precincts," besides the Court-House. Louisa belongs to the eleventh judicial circuit and sixth district. Taxes paid in 1832-3 $3839 20,—in 1833-4—on land, $2,110 92—4764 slaves, $1191 00—3036 horses, $122 16—7 studs, $85 00—76 coaches, $175 35 —44 carryalls, 44 00—91 gigs, $51 95. Total, $3840 38. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $505 13—in 1833, 442 96. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES &amp;c. Boswellville, P.

LUNENBURG. Lunenburg was created by act of the Legislature in 1746, and formed from a part of Brunswick county. It is bounded N. by Prince Edward,— N. E. by Nottoway river, which separates it from Nottoway county,—E. by Brunswick,—S. by Meherrin river, which separates it from Mecklenburg, and W. by Charlotte.—Its length is 25 miles, mean breath 16, and area 400 square miles; and it extends in lat. from 37° 46′ to 37° 04′, and in long. 1° 8′ to 1° 22′ W. of W. C. A ridge runs through the county, from E. to W. N. W., from which the waters flow N. E. and S. E. into the Nottoway and Meherrin. The general slope of the county is S. E. by E. Population in 1820, 10,667—in 1830, 11,957. Lunenburg belongs to the ninth judicial circuit, and fifth district. Tax paid in 1833, $2392 18—in 1834, on land, $1056 91—3813 slaves, $953 25—2236 horses, $134 16—7 studs, $100 00—46 coaches, $128 00—26 carryalls, $26 00—88 gigs, $53 85—Total, $2452 17.

C.—in lat. 36° 50′ N. and in long. 1° 16′ W. of W. C. It is situated about the centre of the county, in an elevated and healthy part of it, on the stage road leading from Petersburg, to Williamsburg, N. C. and the stage passes through on every day except Sunday. It contains 20 dwelling houses, besides a handsome court house of brick, with a portico, and four large columns in front, jail and clerk's office, 2 mercantile stores, and 2 taverns. The principal mechanics are wheelwrights, saddle and harness makers and blacksmiths. This town was lad off in the year 1817, by act of assembly of that year. There was at that time but one family living here. The distance from Petersburg is 65 miles, from Hampden Sydney College 28, and from Randolph Macon College 30 miles. Population 75 persons; of whom two are attorneys, and one a practising physician. County Courts are held on the 2d Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, June, August and November.

Wattsboro', P. O. in the western part of the county, 97 ms. S. W. of R. and 219 from W. MADISON. The county of Madison was created by the Legislature in the year 1792, and was taken entirely from the county of Culpeper. It is bounded on the north by the counties of Rappahannock and Culpeper, on the south by the county of Orange, on the west by the counties of Rockingham and Page, (the top of the Blue Ridge being the dividing line,) and on the east by a part of Culpeper and Orange. Its length is 23¼ miles, and its breadth 12½; and it contains an area of about 290 miles square, extending in lat. from 38° 14′ to 38° 38′ N. and in long. from 1° 09′ to 1° 30′ W. of W. C. In the western part of the county there are several large mountains extending from the Blue Ridge into the county in an easterly direction from five to ten miles; the principal of these are, the Ragged mountain, the Double Top mountain, the Forked mountain, and the Bluff mountain; they are more elevated than the Blue Ridge. From these large and lofty mountains, there are a number of small mountains projecting from them into the county, some of which, are very fertile, and produce in great abundance, wheat, rye, oats, corn, hemp, and tobacco: wheat may be considered the staple of the county. In the mountain region small quantities of tobacco are made, and when well managed, it is of superior quality, and of fine texture and flavor. Between these mountains there are fine valleys of rich bottom land. Fruit of almost every description common to the climate, particularly apples, grow to great perfection and in great abundance, in the mountains of Madison. Hughes' river rises in the Blue Ridge, in the north part of the county, and constitutes a part of the dividing line between Madison and Rappahannock. The Robinson river rises in like manner in the Blue Ridge, and winds its course between the Ragged and Double Top mountains; it affords a quantity of fine low grounds. The high lands properly managed are very productive in small grain. This part of the county is thickly inhabited by industrious, independent farmers. The Rapid Ann (formerly called the Staunton river) rises in the Blue Ridge, between the Double Top mountain and the Bluff mountain, it winds its course in a southeastern direction and passes through a beautiful rich valley, for 8 or 10 miles, where the small mountains break off abruptly. The pine lands commence about that point and extend with a mixture of hickory, oak, chesnut, locust, poplar, &amp;c. to the lower end of the county, a distance of between 15 and 20 miles. The Robinson and Rapid Ann rivers form a junction immediately at the lower end of the county. The Rapid Ann, from 10 to 15 miles above the union with the Robinson, receives several tributary streams, to wit the Conway or Middle river, the South river and the Blue Run. At the lower end of the county, in what is called the Robinson fork, Gryan's run passes through a rich tract of country and empties into the Robinson river. The German ridge, which is a spur of the Double Top mountain, lies east of the Rapid Ann river a short distance, and runs south nearly parallel with the river, until it breaks off at the Rapid Ann meeting house. On the east of this little mountain there are several bold, fine springs, which constitute the head waters of the white oak run, which empties into the Robinson river, about two miles north of Madison C. H. and near the German Lutheran church. This small stream which extends 8 or 10 miles from its source to its junction with the Robinson river, affords a large body of beautiful rich bottom land, it contains a dense and wealthy population. This river passes within half a mile on the west of Madison C. H. In the county there are several other small streams, such as Dark run, Cedar run, between Madison and Culpeper, the Big run and Whetstone run, which empties into the Rapid Ann, near where the small mountains break off. In the county of Madison there is but one incorporated town, called "The Town of Madison," it contains the county seat of Justice. It is a thriving little village, located very near the centre of the county, on a high, elevated ridge, and commands a beautiful and picturesque view of the Blue Ridge and all of the little mountains extending into the county. The Thoroughfare mountain is a small mountain, about 8 miles N. E. of Madison C. H. and the Lost mountain about 5 miles S. E. of the C. H. They are entirely detached from the other mountains, and are nearly 20 miles east of the Blue Ridge. The public buildings have been recently erected of brick. The C. H. is built in the Corinthian order, and the workmanship executed in superior style. There are a number of private schools in the county of Madison, but no public seminary of learning. About the mountains there are many indications of iron ore, particularly about the Forked mountain. Lead has been found on some parts of the German ridge, and it is said recently that some signs of gold have been seen in the lower end of the county, but no particular search or examination has been made. There are two springs in the German ridge and near it, which are strongly impregnated with sulphur, but the water has never been analyzed and no attention seems now to be paid to it. This county is generally well watered, it has a pure climate, portions of it very rich soil, susceptible of a high state of improvement by clover and plaster, and for beauty and sublimity of scenery, surpassed by few spots in Virginia. It contains 12 manufacturing flour mills, 20 grist mills, from 10 to 15 saw mills, a number of tanneries, wheelwrights, carpenters, blacksmiths, 29 saddlers, carding machines, and 15 general stores and groceries. There are in this county 5 resident physicians and 2 attorneys, 6 ministers of the gospel, and 15 churches or meeting houses, and a number of itinerant preachers, principally of the Methodist persuasion. The different religious sects in this county are the Baptists, Episcopalians, Presbyterians, Lutherans and Methodists—the Baptists being the most numerous. Population in 1820, 8,490—in 1830, 9,236. It belongs to the eleventh judicial circuit, and sixth district. Taxes paid in 1833, $2179 70—in 1834, on lots, $39 46—on land, $1350 54—2247 slaves, $561 75—1171 horses, $118 26— 7 studs, $76 00—23 coaches, $47 25—3 carryalls, $3 00—22 gigs, $15 25—Total, $2211 51. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $248 10—in 1833, $316 82. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Criglersville, P. O. 10 ms. N. of the court house. Graves, P.

This county is a peninsula, extending into the Chesapeake bay, united to the main by a narrow neck of land scarcely a mile wide, and its boundaries are almost entirely of water. It is bounded on the north by Piankatank river, which separates it from Middlesex, and by the Chesapeake; on the south by the Chesapeake and Mob-Jack bays; on the east by the Chesapeake; and on the west by North river and Mob-Jack bay and a narrow neck of land uniting it to Gloucester—extending in lat from 37° 22′ to 37° 30′ N. and long from 0° 33′ to 0° 48′ E. of W. C. This county is indented by numerous inlets from the bay, which cut and divide the land into a number of small necks, that are bounded on each side by a creek or river. The principal rivers are the Piankatank, East, and North rivers. The former is a bold stream, about a mile wide at its mouth, and extending itself 30 or 40 miles into the interior, terminates in the Dragon swamp. East river is about the same width of the Piankatank at its mouth, which opens into Mob-Jack bay; it runs about 8 or 9 miles up, in the centre of the county, four miles from its mouth it sends off a branch, named Pudding creek, at the head of which is situated the court house. North river likewise enters into Mob-Jack bay; it does not differ much in size from the two rivers just described, and runs up into Gloucester, for the distance of 15 miles. These rivers are all salt, of course, as they derive their waters from the bay, a little fresh water mingles with them at their heads, but does not materially affect their saltness, except after very heavy and long continued rains. Besides these rivers, there are creeks almost too numerous to be named. Muddy creek is at the upper part of the county, and forms part of the line of separation from Gloucester: it is a very inconsiderable creek, and enters the Piankatank. Cob's creek is rather larger, it is about a mile long, and enters the same river 3 or 4 miles above its mouth. Queen's creek is much more considerable in size, being a fourth of a mile wide, and three miles in length; it enters the Piankatank at its mouth. About three miles below Queen's creek, is the mouth of Slut's creek, which opens into Milford Haven, it is of the same size with Queen's creek. Two miles below are Lilley's and Billup's creeks, they are small and near each other; they enter Milford Haven. A part of the bay which flows in between the main land and Gwyn's island, and extends from the mouth of Piankatank to Billup's creek, is called Milford Haven, and is a secure harbor for vessels. At the lower extremity of the Haven is situated a small, uninhabited island, named Bigby's, between which and the main, is a passage called the Thoroughfare. A short distance below this is Garden creek, which is a small stream that enters into the Chesapeake. Off the mouth of this creek is a shoal, extending five miles out in the bay, named the Wolf Trap, and on which is stationed a light boat. Winter Harbor is a creek or inlet from the bay, which is narrow at its entrance, after running a few hundred yards widens, and diverging extends itself into small branches, which run a mile or two in the land. Horn Harbor is another inlet just below the former, being much larger but not extending itself any farther in the land. Dier's creek is an inconsiderable stream, just below Horn Harbor. The point of land lying below Dier's creek, is the lowest extremity of the county, named New Point Comfort; it is a sandy point which juts out into the bay, and on which is erected a Light House. After leaving New Point Comfort and ascending on the south side of the county, about one mile above is Harper's creek, which is small. Pepper creek two miles above is more considerable. Two or three miles higher up, is the mouth of East river, between which and the mouth of North river is a point called White's. Entering the North river a short distance from its mouth, is Godsey's creek, and 4 or 5 miles higher is Black Water creek, opening in the North river and running a mile or two into the interior. This county is only 20 miles long, and in its widest section not more than 8, and area 127 sq miles, varying from that width, down to a point, so that it will be seen from the sketch of the water courses, that the land is divided into many sections or necks:—thus Chapel neck is a small body of land lying between North river and Black Water:—White's neck lies between North and East rivers, and consists of a considerable body of land which terminates at White's point. The land lying between Cob's and Queen's cr. is called Cow neck, and terminates in two points denominated Iron and Burton's points. Between Queen's and Slut's creeks, is situated Crab neck, at the north corner of which neck is a place called Cricket hill. Lying between Lilley's and Billup's creeks, is Lilley's neck. Between Winter and Horn Harbors, is a small point of land named Potatoe neck. The body of land which is situated between Horn Harbor and East river, extending from thence to the lowest extremity of the county is known as Point Comfort. The most remarkable feature in the topography of this county is its extreme levelness. The banks of the Piankatank river are somewhat elevated and from thence the land descends in an almost uninterrupted plain, until it terminates in the waters of the bay. It was evidently at some period covered by the sea, or bay, as the whole face of the country incontestibly proves. There are about 60,000 acres of land in this county, which is of a medium quality as regards feltility. It produces corn and oats, but is not so well adapted to wheat, from its extreme humidity; the country lays so remarkably level, that it is a very laborious and difficult operation to drain and lay dry the land. The soil is generally a sandy loam, with a substratum of clay; there is little or none of silicious earth, nor does it contain any calcareous matter. Marl has been found in some parts of this county, and if sought, could no doubt be obtained in most places by digging to a sufficient depth. In digging wells, coccle shells, oyster shells, and the shells of many testaceous animals, not known at the present day, are found 20 feet below the surface; together with wood, roots, weeds and a variety of undecomposed vegetable substances. Recently, the leg bone of an animal, supposed to be an ox, although much larger than that animal now exists, was found twenty feet below the surface, which is lower than the bed of the contiguous river. These facts present matter for interesting speculations to the minds of the geologist and naturalist. The natural growth of timber on this land is oak, which ship carpenters say, will vie with the live oak, pine, chesnut and gum. The land after cultivation, if permitted to lie out, invariably puts up a growth of pine. Mathews contains a population of 7666 souls, of which number 3481 are slaves, and 190 free negroes. The people of this county are engaged in ship building, maritime and agricultural pursuits. Until recently the two former occupied their principal attention; so entirely were they engaged in ship building some years back, that the cultivation of the soil, was almost entirely neglected, and it was necessary to import corn for home consumption—hence it is that this county has been behind others in agricultural skill; lately vessel building has decreased, and agriculture receives more attention. About 20 years ago, there were annually built one hundred vessels of various sizes and denominations, from large ships down to the smallest craft; at the present period there are built, every year, from 20 to 30 vessels of different burdens. There are belonging to this county about 200 ship carpenters, a great number of them find employment in the Navy Yards and other places during the summer months, and return to their homes on the approach of winter. The low price at which vessels are built render it rather unprofitable, and the workmen cannot all find employment at home. East river is a port of entry, and has a Collector, and Inspector of the revenue attached to it; there are 1700 tons of shipping belonging to this port, among which is one ship, one brig, and a number of schooners and small skippers. Some of them make voyages to almost every part of the commercial world, hence it is, that many of the young men are trained to the perils of the sea. This county is supplied with meal by means of wind and tide mills, there being 10 wind and 2 tide mills, with only one common grist mill; consequently the people do not feel much inconvenience from long, dry seasons, except in procuring water for the cattle. The land, lying almost on a dead level, there cannot be any fresh water streams running through it, and consequently in dry seasons every cattle hole, at which the stock was watered dries up, and they suffer much from thirst. Sometimes, in excessive drought, the inhabitants have difficulty in procuring water to drink themselves. Wells are generally dug 8 or 10 feet deep, so that the water they contain is that which filtrates through the earth, and when the ground becomes dry, the water ceases to flow; but recently wells have been dug 30 feet, when large veins of water have been found, which are inexhaustible. There are a few springs of excellent water, but they are rare. The manufacture of castor oil has been carried on by only one press, a few years since the palma christi bean was extensively cultivated, but it is now reduced. On the east side of the county is an island comprehended within its limits and known by the name of Gwyn's island; it contains 2000 acres of land, and 200 inhabitants. It is surrounded by the waters of the Chesapeake; it has two points, that to the north is called Cherry Point, and that to the south Sandy Point. There is a tradition, that Pocahontas, in attempting to swim across the Piankatank river, was near drowning, but was rescued from a watery grave by an individual, to whom, as a reward for his services, she gave this island. After Lord Dunmore was driven from Williamsburg, he took up his quarters on this island, where he remained some time. The predominant religion of the people is the Methodist; there are in this county seven meeting houses belonging to that denomination, two of which belongs to the reformed Methodist; there are two Baptist meeting houses, the congregations attached to which are rather thin; there are a few Episcopalians and Universalists, who, however have no places for public worship; the latter never had any church, and the churches held by the former, under the old established English church, have fallen into dilapidation and decay. There is a Sunday school kept at almost every house of public worship in the county, and several common schools, but no academy. Population in 1810, 4227—in 1820, 6920—in 1830, 7666. It belongs to the fourth judicial circuit and second district. Taxes paid in 1833, $955 98 —in 1834, on land, $380 13—1694 slaves, $423 50—559 horses, $33 54 —18 coaches, $46 10—14 carryalls, $16 20—86 gigs, $50 60—Total, $950 07. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Bell Isle, P. O. in the northern part of the county, 13 ms. S. E. of R. and 182 S. S. E. of W. MATHEWS C. H. or Westville, P. V. and seal of justice, is situated near the centre of the county. It lies in 37° 35′ N. lat and 0° 40′ E. long of Washington, 100 ms. E. of R. and 184 from W. C. Westville contains about 30 houses, 4 mercantile stores, 1 tanyard, 3 boot and shoe factories, 1 tailor, 2 blacksmiths, 1 saddler, 1 carriage maker, and 1 tavern. The public buildings are a very neat, new C. H., 2 jails, 1 for criminals and the other for debtors, and a clerk's office. These houses are all well built of brick. Westville is a port of entry; there are 2 regular packets which ply between this place and Norfolk weekly, and 1 that runs from it to Baltimore. Population 150, including 3 regular physicians. County Courts are held on the 2d Monday in every month,—Quarterly in March, May, August and Nov'r. Judge Semple holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the Tuesdays after the 1st Mondays in April and October. North End, P. O. in the W. part of the Co., 91 ms. E. of R. &amp; 175 from W. MECKLENBURG. Mecklenburg, was created by the legislature in 1764, and formed out of a portion of Lunenburg.—It is bounded on the N. by Meherrin river, which divides it from the county of Lunenburg, on the E. by a line runniug S. from the Meherrin to the Roanoke river, where it intersects the North Carolina line. On the S. by the state of N. C. on the W. by Aron's creek, and the Dan and Staunton rivers, which divide it from Halifax, and by a line running N. 31° E. 15½ ms. which divides it from the county of Charlotte. It extends from 36° 30′, to 36° 59′ N. lat. and in long. 1° 08′, to 1° 40′ W. of W. C.—Length 36, mean width 18, and area 736 sq. ms. The rivers Dan and Staunton are separated by a narrow slip of land called the fork of Halifax, for 8 ms. which in that distance is no where more than 1 mile wide, and in several places not more than 100 yards, and has three passages uniting the 2 rivers before their final junction at Clarksville where they form the Roanoke. The Dan from Aron's creek, as the river meanders to its junction with the Staunton at Clarksville, is 12½ ms., and its course is E. S. E. the course of the Staunton is S. E. by E. and its distance as the river meanders from the Charlotte line, to Clarksville, is 9 ms. The course of the Roanoke from Clarksville to the S. E. corner of the county, where it intersects the N. C. line, is E. by S.—Thus the Roanoake and Dan divide the county into two unequal parts; that on the S. side of the river is somewhat the largest, but much the narrowest, and lies in the form of a rectangular triangle, the legs of which are the N. C. line; and Aron's creek, and the rivers Roanoke and Dan form the hypothenuse, throwing about 200 sq. ms. of this county, on the S. side of the river. There are on the Roanoke, about 12,000 acres of very fertile low grounds, which are valued on an average, at $30 00 per acre—the average width of the river is about 250 yards, and it has a descent or fall, of about 2 feet in a mile the greatest falls are those at the Horseford, and Butcher's creek falls, each of which has a fall of about 5 feet, in the distance of a mile. Fish are not very abundant in this river, but in the proper season a few shad are caught on the slopes fixed in the river, and with small seins—the other fish are jack, chub, perch, round fish, &amp;c. This river is navigable for boats, carrying 9 or 10 hogsheads of tobacco. The river Meherrin which forms the northern boundary of the county, is (below the forks of the N. and S. Meherrin) about 40 yards wide on an average, and the decent, or fall of the river is about 3 feet in a mile. The bed of this river, is about 10 feet higher than the bed of the Roanoke. The quantity of low grounds on it, is not more than 1,000 acres, valued at an average price of $20 00 per acre. This river would be one of the easiest to render navigable of any in the state, by means of lock and dam navigation, from the head to Bellfield, in Greensville, where the Petersburg Rail road crosses the river. The principal creeks in the county, on the S. side of the river, head in Granville, N. C., and are Aron's creek, which divides it from Halifax, on which are located 3 grist and 2 saw mills; and Buffalo creek on the margin of which, is 1 grist mill. On the latter creek are situated those valuable medicinal springs, called the Buffalo springs which in the watering season are visited by a number of persons from the south eastern part of the state, who do not choose to go as far up the country as the mountains: those 2 creeks empty into the Dan river. On Blue Creek, half a mile below Clarksville, is situated 1 saw and grist mill. Grassey Creek has 1 grist mill on it, and receives before it empties into the river the water of Beaver pond creek this creek empties into the Roanoke three fourths of a mile above Field's ferry. Nutbush has 1 grist mill locaated on it, and empties into the river, 1½ ms. below Haskins' ferry. Cotton creek enters the river 1¾ ms. below Alexande'rs ferry, and Smith's creek, 2 ms. below St. Tammany. Those creeks which empty into the Staunton, on the N. side of the river, are the Big, Little, and Middle Bluestone. Big Bluestone heads in Charlotte, and Little and Middle Bluestone empty into it before it reaches the river. Kettle Creek also empties into Bluestone. Island creek is rather a biou or arm of the river, which breaks or runs out below Skipwith's ferry, and again enters the river, about 5 ms. below Clarksville; but before it empties into the river again, it receives the Sandy creek. On Butcher's creek is situated 2 mills, and empties into the Roanoke at Butcher's creek falls, about 10 ms. below Clarksville. Allen's creek is the largest and longest creek in the county, and discharges more water than any other,—it has 3 mills on it, and receives on its passage to the river Coleman's, and Mine creeks from the W. and Laton's creek, Cox's creek and the Long Branch on the E. Coleman's and Cox's creek have each 1 mill on them. Allen's creek divides the lands of the county on the N. side of the river, into two nearly equal parts, it enters the river about 2 ms above Alexander's ferry. On Miles' creek is located 3 mills and emptics into the river at Goode's ferry. Dockery creek empties into Miles' creek. Aven's creek and Parham's creek empty into Flat creek, which has 1 mill on it, and empties into the river 2¾ ms. below Goode's ferry. Great creek has 1 mill on it, and empties into the river 7½ ms. below St. Tammany. Robin's creek empties into the Roanoke, near Haskins' ferry. Most of the larger creeks which empty into Roanoke, head within 2 or 3 ms of the Meherrin. There are several other small creeks which empty into Roanoke, or into the large creeks before they get to the river. The creeks which empty into Meherrin river, are Finnewood, which rises in Charlotte, Otter creek, Blackstone creek, Buckhorn mountain, and Stith's creek. Taylor's creek rises in this county, and empties into the Meherrin 1 mile below Gee's Bridge, in the county of Brunswick. The quantity of low grounds which lie on the creeks and branches, may be estimated at about 4,000 acres, and is supposed to be worth an average price of $20 an acre. The most eastern mountain in the state is in this county, and lies on the Meherrin river, at the mouth of Mountain creek,—it is called Watkins' mountain. This county is neither mountainous or level, but is beautifully undulating, with hills and vallies it is more hilly near the Meherrin river than elsewhere. The ridge which divides the waters of the Roanoke, from those of the Meherrin, is 210 ft. higher than the bed of the Roanoke, and 200 higher than the bed of the Meherrin. The soil of this county is generally fertile, although the ridges are thin and poor, yet it is generally a free soil. The lower, or eastern part of the county, is generally a light gray, or sandy soil, but free and productive; producing corn, oats cotton and tobacco of excellent quality, and as abundantly as any other part of the county; it is in truth, the best cotton land in the county, but it is not so good for wheat as the other parts. There is a strip of land, running nearly through the centre of the county, from N. to S. about 10 ms. in width, commencing 1 mile below Allen's creek and continuing for 3 miles above Butcher's creek the land is stiff and red,—it consists of some of the best tracts of land in the county, though upon the ridges near Allen's and Butcher's creeks, some of it is sterile, but generally it is the best wheat land in the county, and produces a rich heavy crop of tobacco; and in wet years excellent crops of corn and oats. The land in the upper part of the county above this red belt, is a light grey, gravelly soil, and produces abundantly corn, oats, wheat and tobacco, but very little cotton is made in this section. The land on the S. side of Roanoke, is generally a light grey, fertile soil; and near Buffalo creek is a very free, productive grain land; on, and near Grassy creek, both above and below, it is not so good,—on Nutbush, Cotton, and Smith's creek, it is generally very good and productive in grain, cotton and tobacco, The land on Bluestone, Cox's creek, Miles' creek, and Flat creek, is the best in the county, except the Roanoke plantations. The land on Allen's creek and Butcher's creek, although it contains a few of the best upland tracts in the county, is generally inferior to other parts. The minerology of this county is but little known. There are some old pits, which are said to have been dug during, or before the revolution, by a mining company; and it is said that considerable quantities of silver were obtained from them; but nothing has been attempted with them within the last 50 or 60 years,—they are situated on Mine creek, near the centre of the county. There are indications of coal and iron to be found in several places, but no exertions have ever been made to discover the quantity, or value of it. There is a vein of granite, running through the county from S. W. to N. E. and in many of the hills, much gray rock. On most of the districts there is much common white flint rock, and in many places a species of rock which is of a yellowish gray color, which pulverizes very easily, and makes a fine grit for polishing metals. The timber is oak, pine and hickory,—the pine is principally confined to the lands about the centre of the county, between Cox's creek, and Bluestone, the oak is principally red oak, black jack and Spanish oak, with some white oak and post oak. The grape vine is very abundant. The under growth is chinquepin, dogwood, sassafras, shumack, &amp;c. The best qualities of the high land, has for its growth, post oak, hickory and black jack, or red oak; the thinner soils are covered with white oak, Spanish oak and pine. The low grounds produce considerable quantities of poplar, sycamore, birch, beech, ash, elm, &amp;c. with some paupau, red bud and buckeye. The products of agriculture in this county are principally corn, wheat, tobacco and oats, with some cotton.—The quantity of tobacco, may be estimated at 3,500 hogsheads annually; the culture of cotton has been much reduced within the last 3 or 4 years, and at this time does not much exceed 100 bales for exportation; wheat is produced in considerable quantities for exportation—and the culture of it is increasing since the Roanoke has been rendered navigable, and would be still further increased, if the Meherrin was rendered navigable, which it is expected will shortly be undertaken. The amount of agricultural capital employed in the county may be stated as follows:— Value of the land at cash price, $2,150,000 00 Value of slaves, at cash price, 2,750,000 00 Horses, cattle and plantation implements, 275,000 00 $5,175,000 00 It may be safely assumed, after deducting the clothing, feeding and tax of the slaves,—the feeding and tax of the horses and other stock, and the repairs of plantation tools, that the profit on the whole agricultural capital, counting the increase of the slaves, stock, &amp;c. is equal to about 15 per cent. per annum; of which the whites, who are not actually employed in the field, must be supported, which leaves but little,—not over 3 or 4 per cent. of clear profits to the county. The tobacco, cotton and wheat, is nearly all sold in Petersburg, Richmond and Clarksville, but a considerable quantity of wheat, is manufactured into flour and some of it is sent down the Roanoke, to the lower parts of N. Carolina, and to Norfolk. Randolph Macon College is situated in this county, 1 mile W. of Boydton, and bids fair to be a very valuable and respectable literary institution; it has not been 2 years since its first establishment, and it has at present 3 professors, besides the President of the college,—an excellent preparatory school attached to it; and at the present session 87 students in college, and 66 in the preparatory school; it is considered to be principally under the direction and care of the Methodist church, but not entirely so, as several of the Trustees do not belong to that church. There is in Boydton a female Academy, which deservedly ranks high as a boarding school for young ladies; and 2 other very respectable boarding schools for young ladies in the county; but the general plan of education in this county, is the old fashioned mode of building a little log house in each neighborhood, where there are as many scholars to be had as will employ a teacher, at about $100 or 150, and the price which is generally paid for tuition, is from $7 to 10 for each pupil, for the scholastic year of from 10 to 11 months. The number of common schools in the county is 62, and the average number of pupils to each is 16,—making 990 pupils in the common schools,—there are 64 in the young ladies boarding schools, 66 in the R. 30 M. preparatory school, and 87 in the college,—making the whole number of students in the county 1,207. The most numerous denomination of Christians in this county is the Methodists they have 26 meeting houses. The next most numerous sect is the Baptists, which has 15 meeting houses: the next is the Presbyterians, which has 3 meeting houses. The last denomination is the Episcopalians, which has 2 churches in the county. There are in this county 23 mercantile stores, which sell on an average $210,000 worth of dry goods, annually only. This county purchases yearly about 360,000 weight of pork from the western drovers. The principal mechanical pursuits of the county, are carpenters, blacksmiths and wheelwrights the first being the most numerous: of the second, there are 47 shops in operation, and several of the latter. There are 4 tanyards, several saddle and harness makers, 3 carriage and gig manufactories, 3 cabinet makers, several boot and shoe factories, and 4 tailor's shops,—there are 26 licensed taverns, 9 manufacturing flour mills, 31 grist, and 8 saw mills, also 19 regular physicians and 9 practising attorneys,—2 United States mail stages pass through this county 3 times a week, 1 from N. to S. and the other from E. to W. crossing each other at Boydton. There are on the Dan and Staunton rivers 2 ferries, Nelson's ferry which crosses the Staunton at Abbeville, and Skipwith's which crosses the Dan and Staunton at the lowest point of Union, before their final junction, 1 mile above Clarksville, and there are 7 which cross the Roanoke, Sommerville's which crosses the river at Clarksville,—Field's which crosses 6½ ms. below Clarksville,—Taylor's 4¾ ms. below Field's, and 3 ms. S. of Boydton,— Haskins' 7½ ms. below Taylor's,—Alexander's 9 ms. below Haskins',— Goode's 3 ms. below Alexander's, and St. Tammany or Blanton's ferry, which crosses the river at St. Tammany's 4 ms. below.

Randolph Macon College, situated about a mile from the village of Boydton, in Mecklenburg county was founded by the Virginia Conference of the Methodist Episcopal church, and is considered to be specially under the superintendance and patronage of that denomination. It is however, strictly a literary institution, there being no theological professorship in it, nor is it contemplated to have such at any future time. The avowed object of its founders, is to afford a liberal education at a very reduced expense, and for the means to enable them to do so, they rely solely on private subscriptions and donations,—the state having contributed nothing towards it. The buildings are of the best brick, and are covered with tin, on an improved plan. They are extensive and elegant, furnishing according to calculation, accommodation for 200 students. "The studies taught are divided into 4 departments: 1st That of Languages 2nd That of Mathematics 3rd That of Natural Philosophy and Chemistry: and 4th That of Ethics;" and it is contemplated to establish a "department of agriculture," agreeably to a provision of the charter; in view of which the Trustees have purchased 300 acres of excellent land adjoining the College. There is also attached to the institution a preparatory school, the principle of which is a member of the Faculty of the College;—the school of course, being under the same immediate government as the College. This institution was chartered by the legislature of Virginia, in 1830, and was opened with a few students in 1832. The members have been rapidly increasing however, and it now (April 1834) has 150, with a flattering prospect of a still greater number. Indeed its prosperity may be regarded as certain; especially if the Trustees shall be able to endow it liberally, as it is proposed to do. The College edifice stands on a beautiful eminence, from the summit of which a commanding view of the surrounding country may be seen; while from its base, springs of pure and living water constantly gush. The situation is as healthy as it is beautiful— a fact which is of course essential to its prosperity. Spanish Grove, P. O. 116 ms. S. W. of R., and 217 from W. Saint Tammany's P.

Middlesex was created by act of Assembly in 1675, and formed out of a part of Lancaster county. It is bounded on the N. W. by Essex,—N. E. by the Rappahannock, which separates it from the counties of Richmond and Lancaster,—S. E. by the Chesapeake bay and S. W. by the Dragon Run, and Piankitank river, which separates it from the counties of King &amp; Queen, Gloucester, and Mathews. This county comprises a long and narrow point between its two bounding rivers. Its greatest length from N. W. to S. E. or from the Essex line to Stingray Point is about 39 miles, its mean breadth 5; and area 175 sq. ms. It extends in lat from 37° 30′ to 37° 48′ W. and in long. from 0° 13′ to 0° 40′ E. of W. C. Within ten miles of the Chesapeake bay the two rivers Piankitank and Rappahannock gradually approach each other, and emptying into the bay, form a point to which the name of Stingray has been given. Many navigable branches of the Rappahannock river make up into the county, affording convenience to the farmer in sending his produce to Baltimore and Norfolk, at which markets the produce of this county is most generally sold. The lands lying immediately on the Dragon, Piankitank, and Rappahannock are fertile. The Piankitank river is navigable about 14 miles from the bay. Thence to its source, a distance of about 60 or 70 miles, it is called the Dragon Run; on either side of which, there is a space varying from a quarter of a mile to half a mile in width, covered with valuable cypress, and other timber, and of inexhaustable fertility. This land is at present valueless to its proprietors from the frequent inundations, caused by the obstructions to the flow of water in the bed of the Run. The attention of the Legislature has been called to the removal of these obstructions, and thereby bringing into market an immense quantity of timber, and the produce of a large district of land which would thus be made arable.—But the want of energy in the owners of the adjoining farms has hitherto prevented, and it is feared, will continue to prevent the execution of any plan for effecting these desirable objects. The prevailing religion of this county is the Baptist. Population in 1820, 4,057—in 1830, 4122. Middlesex belongs to the fourth judicial circuit and second district. Taxes paid in 1833, $799 06 —in 1834.—On lots, $14 70—on land, $364 23—on 1140 slaves, $285 00 —451 horses, $26 06—2 studs, $30 00—11 coaches, $29 25—7 carryalls, $7 00—85 gigs, $49 66 Total, $806 90. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $539 91—in 1833, $416 42. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Churchville, P. O. 76 ms. from R. and 135 from W. situated 6 ms. from the Essex line and 7 from Urbanna. Healy's, P. O. situated on the Piankatank river, 12 ms. below Urbanna. URBANNA, P. V. and county seat, 83 ms. a little N. of E. from Richmond, and 142 a little E. of S. from W. C.—situated on the northern shore, and near the mouth of one of the branches of the Rappahannock called Urbanna creek. It is a sea port, located 18 ms. above the mouth of the river,—a small but healthy village. It contains besides the ordinary county buildings, 9 private dwelling houses, 4 mercantile stores, 2 taverns, 1 cabinet maker, 1 tailor, and 1 carriage maker. Population 175 persons, of whom 2 are resident attorneys, 4 regular physicians, and 7 officiating ministers of the Baptist church. Urbanna for many years seemed rapidly going to decay, but of late has much improved in population, the number of its stores, &amp;c.— There is much travelling through this place, to and from the adjoining counties, by persons who take the steamboats here for Fredericksburg and Baltimore. The northern mail (via Tappahannock,) and the southern mail (via York,) are each transmitted twice a week through this county, stopping at Churchville, Urbanna, and Healy's post offices. County Courts are held on the 4th Monday in every month. Quarterly in March, May, August and November. Judge Semple holds his Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the Tuesday after the 3d Monday in April and October. NANSEMOND. Nansemond was created by act of Assembly in the year 1645, and formed from a part of the county of Upper Norfolk. It is bounded on the N. by Hampton Roads,—E. by Norfolk county,—S. by Pasquotank county of North Carolina,—W. by Blackwater river which separates it from Southampton,—and N. W. by the county of Isle of Wight. Its length diagonally from S. W. to N. E. is 40 miles, mean breadth 16, and area 640 square miles,—and it extends in lat from 36° 30′ to 36° 54′ N. and in long. from 0° 6′ to 0° 41′ E of W. C. Rivers.—The Nansemond is the largest river in the county, about 31 miles in length from its mouth to Cohoon's mill, where it heads—it empties into Hampton Roads, and is 7 miles wide at its mouth. Its course is N. N. E. and runs nearly in the middle of the county as far as it goes. It is navigable to Suffolk for vessels of from 75 to 100 tons, and for small craft and lighters to Cohoon's mill. Nansemond river affords the finest oysters, crabs, and fish. Western Branch Creek is a branch of Nansemond river, about 10 miles in length;—it heads at Urquhart's mill, and empties into the Nansemond about 7 miles below Suffolk. Vessels of 75 to 100 tons burthen can be navigated as far as Milner's five miles above its mouth. Just below Milner's, this creek forks, sending a branch to Scott's mill. it is navigable for vessels from 35 to 40 tons as far as Scott's mill, which is distant about 5 miles from its mouth. The course of the Western Branch is nearly E. Chuckatuck Creek rises at Chuckatuck mill—is about 10 miles long, and empties into James river. It is navigable for vessels of 35 to 40 tons for 6 miles. It courses E. Black Water river is the dividing line between Nansemond and Southampton for the distance of about 12 miles. course S. E.—any vessel which can come in at Ocracoke Inlet, can be navigated to South Quay. Somerton Creek is formed by the junction of Knuckle and Bear Swamps, in the county of Nansemond, it then runs about 8 miles in this county: course S. W.—and empties into Chowan river, about 2 miles from the Nansemond line. Lake Drummond is supposed to be from 15 to 18 miles in circumference: it differs but little in its diameter from N. to S. or E. to W. The water has perhaps gained more celebrity than it merits it is slighty diuretic. in some seasons of the year it will affect the bowells also a little, like any other water if confined, and impregnated with so much vegetable matter. It contains a quantity and variety of fish. The brown perch and chub are large and very fine: there are other varieties of perch, not so highly prized,—also pike, gars, catfish, eels, &amp;c. Few wild fowl are found on this beautiful lake, which is somewhat remarkable, and the few which frequent it are principally ducks. Nearly the whole of the lake is within this county;—perhaps a mile of the eastern extremity may be in Norfolk county: the depth of water is from 12 to 14 feet a few hundred yards from the margin. The bottom of the lake is hard and firm. The Dismal Swamp Land Company's Canal, from the basin (which is on the bank of Cedar Creek,* * Craney Creek is the ancient name. a branch of the Nansemond,) to the lake is 10 miles;—running for 6 miles nearly S. E. and then S.—width from 10 to 12 feet;—depth from 3 to 4 feet. The water of the canal flows into the lake: it is connected with the Dismal Swamp Canal Company through the waters of the lake. From tide water to the lake the distance is 10 miles. The Dismal Swamp Land Company's land (with the exception of a small part which is in the county of Norfolk,) is situated in the county of Nansemond—quantity of acres forty thousand. The growth consists of juniper, cypress, gum, ash, maple, pine. The quantity of shingles usually exported by the Company is from 2½ to 3 millions per annum, amounting to $40 or $50,000—governed by fluctuation in prices. Agriculture is at a low ebb, although certainly improving within a few years. More attention has been paid to making and using manure from farm pens. The benefit of marl has been fully tested, yet although abundant on the river and creek banks, is still used in a limited way. The principal crops are corn, oats, peas, some wheat and cotton. The staple is Indian corn. Tar, turpentine and staves are not so abundant as formerly;—they still form the principal and leading articles of trade in the county. Population in 1810, 10,324—1820, 10,494—in 1830, 11,784. Nansemond belongs to the first judicial circuit and first district. Taxes paid in 1833, $2067 73—in 1834 on lots, $175 20—on land, 920 12—2320 slaves, $580 00—1411 horses, $84 66—6 studs, $66 00—45 coaches, $97 07—1 stage, $1 00—4 carryalls, $4 00—231 gigs, $136 15 Total, $2064 18. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $238 51—in 1833, $438 97. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Chuckatuck, P. V. 110 ms. from R. and 214 from W. Chuckatuck can scarcely be termed a village, but is more properly a thickly populated neighborhood, embracing about one square mile; the central part of which is at the head waters of a creek bearing the same name, and which makes into James river about 8 ms. from this place. It is situated on the stage road leading from Smithfield, Isle of Wight county, to Suffolk, the county seat, 10 miles distant from both places, and about 20 from Norfolk by the nearest land route. It contains 20 dwelling houses, 3 mercantile stores, 1 tavern, and 1 house of public worship, (Methodist.) There are about 125 inhabitants, including the operatives employed in the Smithfield and Chuckatuck Cotton Manufactory, erected by a company. This establishment runs 1000 spindles propelled by water power. It is in successful operation, and largely contributes to the business appearance and support of this place Within this square mile is an old venerable Episcopalian brick church, around which there are some hand some and valuable farms. The population is about 300 persons; of whom 1 is a physician. The neighborhood possesses great advantages, having a level and fertile soil, fish and oysters of the finest kind in abundance, and navigation at the doors of its inhabitants. Somerton, P.

County Courts are held on the 2d Monday in every month. Quarterly in March, June, August, and November. Judge Baker holds his Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 15th May and 30th September. South Quay, P. O. 95 ms S. S. E. of Richmond and 217 from W. C. South Quay is situated on Black Water river, which is a branch of the Chowan river of N. Carolina, and makes the dividing line between Nansemond and Southampton counties. It contains about half a dozen houses, and its principal pursuits are agriculture. There is a post office and also a surveyor's office for the collection of the revenue. The latter having been established in consequence of the importance attached to the place during the Revolutionary and late war as a Quay, or depot for goods— its inland advantages recommending it as such. There are only two families residing here, consisting of 40 or 50 persons; 2 of whom are attorneys. In the immediate vicinity are several physicians, both scientific and Thompsonians, meeting houses, schools, mercantile stores, and mills; and the neighborhood is somewhat densely settled. Should the contemplated rail road between Portsmouth and the Roanoke be completed, of which there is every probability, the value of this place will doubtless be greatly enhanced, as it will pass immediately by South Quay. This, together with the Dismal Swamp canal, which connects the Carolina and Virginia waters, already having a very sensible influence on this part of the country. NELSON. Nelson was created by act of Assembly in 1807, and formed out of a part of Amherst county. It is situated immediately between the Blue Ridge and James river. Bounded by Albemarle N. E. and E.—by James river separating it from Buchingham S. E.—and Amherst S., and S. W.— by the Blue Ridge, separating it from Rockbridge W.—and Augusta S. W. The longest line is diagonal from the extreme southern to the extreme northern angle—about 40 ms.—greatest width 28—and area 560 sq. ms.—extending in lat. from 37° 32′ to 38° 02′ N. and in long. from 1° 50′ to 2° 7′ W. of W. C. Its declivity is S. of S. E.—and it is drained by' the different branches of Rock Fish and Tye rivers. This county is very broken and mountainous, particularly as it approaches the Blue Ridge. Between the ridges of mountains are many beautiful vallies, very fertile and productive; upon the James are extensive low grounds, from a quarter to half a mile in width, very rich and fertile:—in the northwestern part of the county, on the head waters of the Rockfish river, and on the southwestern, on the waters of the Tye river, are large tracts of low grounds, and nearly level bodies of fine productive lands. The staple products of the country are, wheat, Indian corn, tobacco, rye, oats and potatoes—to the production of which the soil is well adapted. Tobacco was at one time the principal production for market, but the cultivation of that article has of late years greatly diminished, and has been succeeded by the less exhausting cultivation of wheat and rye. This county is watered in the S. W. by Tye river, and in the N. E. by Rockfish river, both have their sources in the Blue Ridge, and after running entirely through the county empty into the James. They are by the aid of artificial improvement, capable of batteaux navigation to within 10 or 12 miles of the Blue Ridge. The mountains in this county afford evident indications of being filled with iron and copper ore, and contain several chalybeate springs, one of which in the S. E. is much frequented, and has been found very beneficial in all cases of debility. The mountains of this county generally contain a very rich soil, capable of producing fine crops of tobacco and corn, and partially adapted to the production of potatoes and hemp.—There is no county in the State which affords, by the exhaustion of the soil, more lamentable proofs of an injudicious system of husbandry; but there is now a spirit of improvement among the planters and farmers; they are beginning to use clover and gypsum freely, the beneficial influence of which is very manifest,—and in a few years there is but little doubt that this county will be among the most fertile, productive and wealthy counties in the State. Besides the rivers before referred to, there are numerous creeks penetrating this county, in every direction, affording many sites for mills and other machinery. There are three manufacturing mills.—The forest of the county consists of oak, pine, chesnut, chesnut oak, hickory and poplar.—In the spring, summer and autumn, the scenery exhibited by the mountains and vallies, is truly beautiful and picturesque, but in the winter gloomy and desolate. The health of the county is equal to that of any county in the State. Population in 1820, 10,137—in 1830, 11,251. Nelson belongs to the twelfth judicial circuit and sixth district. Taxes paid in 1833, $2723 88 —in 1834, on lots, $63 36—on land, $1586 57—2983 slaves, $745 75— 2375 horses, $142 50—16 studs, $184 50—16 coaches, $41 30—15 carryalls, $16 15—11 gigs, $6 95. Total, $2787 08. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $169 06—in 1833, $192 45. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Dawson's, P. O. 107 ms. N. W. of R. and 149 S. W. of W. Faber's Mills, P. O. in the W. part of the county, 170 ms. S. W. of W. C. and 103 W. of R. It contains 1 mercantile store, 1 distillery, 1 blacksmith shop, 1 tailor, 1 boot and shoe factory, 1 wheelwright, 1 manufacturing flour mill, 1 saw mill, 1 woollen manufactory, and 10 dwelling houses; in the vicinity there is a Baptist house of public worship. Population 50. Greenfield, P. O. 152 ms. from W. and 110 from R. LOVINGSTON, P. V. and seat 31 of justice, 118 ms. a little N. of W. from R. and 160 S. W. of W. C., in lat 37° 44′ and long. 1° 52′ W. of W. C.—situated on a branch of Tye river, near the centre of the county, on the stage road leading from Charlottesville to Lynchburg, nearly equidistant between the two places, 40 ms. nearly S. from Staunton, and 36 ms. nearly N. from Buckingham C. H. "It is a thriving little village, beautifully situated in a cove, at the head of which is Loving's Gap to the N. and commanding a view of a fine country to the S. The surrounding hills are truly romantic. The Sugar Loaf mountain is situated about 4 ms. from town, the top of which is often visited by parties to enjoy the rich scenery of an extended eastern and southern view, and the prospect of an unbroken chain of the Blue Ridge mountain of more than 60 ms. in extent. The view from Hanblet's mountains which is near town, is among the most interesting in the State The Blue Ridge, the Sugar Loaf, the Tobacco Row, and many other mountains are in full view, whilst the southern prospect unfolds to the vision plantation beyond plantation, woods beyond woods, hill beyond hill in rich succession, until the scene closes, where earth and sky meet, in the far distant horizon." "Lovingston contains 124 houses, among which are the court house, clerk's office, and jail, enclosed by a brick wall, which is entered through two arched gates. There are 6 mercantile stores, 1 apothecary shop, 2 schools, 2 taverns, 1 tanyard, 2 saddlers, 1 blacksmith, 2 cabinet makers, 1 milliner and mantua maker, 1 wheelwright, 1 house joiner, and 1 chair maker. The different christian denominations are Methodist, Baptist, and Presbyterian. The court house is used as a place for public worship. Population 250 persons, of whom there are 3 attorneys, and 2 practising physicians." County Courts are held on the 4th Monday in every month; Quarterly in March, May, August and November. Judge Thompson holds his Circuit. Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 29th of April and September. Mount Horeb, P. O. 111 ms. W. of R. and 160 from W. Murrell's Shop, P. O. 110 ms. W. of R. and 177 from W. New Market, or Tye River Warehouse, P. O. in the southern part of the county, at the influx of Tye river into the James, 108 ms. W. of R. and 165 from W. It contains a tobacco inspection, at which from 3 to 500 hosgheads are annually inspected, 1 mercantile store, 1 tavern, a grist and saw mill, a blacksmith shop, and 12 or 14 dwelling houses. Population 65 persons, of whom 2 are physicians. Tye River Mills, P. O. in the western part of the county, 131 ms. N. W. of R. and 173 from W.—situated on the Blue Ridge, near Tye river, and Tye river turnpike, 10 miles N. W. of Lovingston, in a populous neighborhood. The farmers of the surrounding country are wealthy and the land fertile, producing well all the staples of the country. There are several mills and mercantile stores in the neighborhood. Variety Mills, P. O. in the eastern part of the county, 112 ms. N. W. of R. and 167 from W. It contains 4 dwelling houses, 1 manufacturing mill, 1 grist mill, 1 mercantile store, 1 tanyard, and 1 cooper shop. Population 25. Warminster, P. O. in the eastern part of the county, 160 ms. S. W. of W. and 100 W. of R.—situated on the left bank of James river, ¼ mile from its margin, where it receives the waters of Swan creek, 50 ms below Lynchburg. Though called a village, it consists at present of but 3 dwelling houses, and 2 store houses, and a masonic hall nearly in ruins, which is sometimes used as a place of public worship. A classical school has been annually kept here, or in the immediate vicinity. White population 15, colored 10. One physician has generally resided here. Warminster was established by enactment in the year 1788, and for a number of years carried on a profitable commerce with the surrounding country to the extent of 40 or 50 miles. The foundations of several of the largest estates in Virginia were laid here; but with the progress of population in other quarters of the State—with the division of the old county of Amherst, and the subsequent establishment of the towns of New Glasgow and Amhert C. H., Lovingston and New Market, Bent Creek, and other places, trade has been carried to every man's door, so that the country which was once tributary to Warminster, now carries its support to other places with greater natural advantages.— This place, in consequence, has for some years past been retrograding in the number of its inhabitants and houses; many of the lots have been purchased by the proprietor of the estate, in the midst of which it is situated, and have been thrown into the adjacent fields.—An inspection of tobacco was authorised by the same law which established the town, and was continued for some years with considerable success, and abandoned, like most of the smaller inspections on James river. The statute book likewise presents several enactments authorising lotteries for raising money to build an academy, a church, and for opening roads to this place: but it is not known that any of these were ever carried into effect. The valley of James river though fertile here, is narrow, and the interior country on either side is not productive. The roads to it from every quarter are bad, and it is not probable that even the contemplated central improvement would increase the village beyond its present size. It may be remarked however that its situation is picturesque in a high degree. From a cliff opposite, on the right bank of the river, is an extensive and interesting view, taking in the fertile valley, winding for several miles above and below, with the seats on the adjacent heights; the small village half concealed by trees in the midst of the cultivated plain below, the near prospect embraced by ranges of mountains beyond, and the Blue Ridge, predominant over the whole, in the distant horizon. NEW KENT. New Kent was created by an act of the House of Burgesses in 1654, and formed from a part of York county. It is bounded N. by the Pamunkey, which separates it from King William—N. E. by the York, separating it from King and Queen,—E. by James City,—S. by the Chickahominy, which separates it from Charles City and Henrico,—and W. by Hanover. Its length diagonally from east to west, is 33 miles, its mean breadth 7, and its area 231 sq. ms.—It extends in lat. from 37° 19′ to 37° 36′ N. and in long. from 0° 11′ E. to 0° 24′ W. of W. C.—New Kent is composed of two narrow inclined planes; leaning towards its bounding rivers, its surface is hilly. Population in 1820, 6,630—in 1830, 6,458. New Kent belongs to the fourth judicial circuit and second district. Tax paid in 1832-3, $1271 91—in 1833-4, on lands, $618 84—1753 slaves, $438 25 —834 horses, $50 04—2 studs, $22 00—29 coaches, $68 25—12 carryalls $12 50—50 gigs, $48 00—Total, $1257 88. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $102 22—in 1833, $161 64. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. NEW KENT C. H. P. V. near the centre of the county, 133 miles S.

C.—situated on the south side of the main stage road leading from Richmond to Williamsburg, and 3 miles S. of Pamunkey river, the nearest point of which from the C. H. is the old town of Cumberland, situated immediately on the south side of the river. Besides the usual county buildings, this village contains 10 dwelling houses, 6 mercantile stores, and 4 taverns—no house of public worship, the C. H. being made use of for that purpose—The stage from Richmond to Williamsburg arrives here on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and leaves here for Richmond, on Tuesdays, Thursdays, &amp; Saturdays. There are 2 other mails a week—1 from Hanover C. H. and another from King William C. H., the former on Tuesdays, the latter on Wednesdays. New Kent C. H. may be considered a healthy place, there being no ponds or other stagnant waters within four miles of the village. Population 41 persons; of whom one is a physician. County Courts are held on the 2d Thursday in every month;—Quarterly in March, May, August and November. Judge Semple holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 2nd Monday in May and November. NORFOLK. Norfolk was created by act of the Legislature in 1691, and formed out of a part of lower Norfolk. It is bounded on the N. by Hampton Roads and the Chesapeake,—E. by Princess Anne,—S. by Currituck and Camden counties of North Carolina,—and W. by Nansemond. Its length from south to north is 32 miles, its mean width 17, and area 544 sq. miles,—extending in lat. from 36° 30′ to 36° 59′ N. and in long. from 0° 33′ to 1° 2′ E. of W. C. The northern part of this county is drained through Elizabeth river into the Chesapeake, and the southern through the Dismal Swamp, and Lake Drummond, into the Pasquotank, and thence into Albemarle Sound, North Carolina (See an account of the Dismal Swamp in the General Description of Virginia, page 41, the more particular description there promised for this county, not having come to hand.) The Dismal Swamp Canal is 22 miles long, and has been a work of such labor and difficulty, as cannot be appreciated by those who have not seen it in progress. The public reports show that nearly $800,000 have been expended on the work. The tolls of the year ending November 30th 1832, were $33,290, and those of 1829 were only $13,040, showing an increase of $20,250. Lake Drummond, near the centre of the Dismal Swamp, and three miles from the Canal, is in times of great drought the only feeder, it has a surface of about six square miles, and varies from 10 to 20 feet deep. Its surface when full is 21½ feet above tide water, and 6 above the level of the water in the upper level of the canal, which has five locks, two of the north end rising 13 feet. The N. W. lock, 10 miles S. has 3½ feet rise to the summit level; Culpeper lock, 6 miles distant, 3½ feet fall; and the south descending lock has 13 feet fall. This canal opens a communication between the port of Norfolk, and Portsmouth, and the waters of Albemarle and Pamlico sounds. The north end empties into Deep creek, a branch of Elizabeth river, 4 miles in length; and the south into Joice's creek, a branch of Pasquotank river. The Dismal Swamp is 20 miles through, in the direction of the canal. As the Portsmouth and Roanoke Rail Road, which is now under contract, is likely to exercise a very important influence upon the destinies of the whole section of country through which it will pass, we give a description of its location and plan of construction, from the report of its engineer Walter Gwynn, Esq. "The line which I have selected as the basis of my estimate, commences at the intersection of the western boundary of Portsmouth and the centre line of High street, and proceeds over an extremely level and unbroken surface to an eligible site for crossing by a bridge, a branch of the Nansemond river, a few hundred yards north of the termination of the Dismal Swamp Land Company's Canal. Thence continuing the line to Suffolk several spring branches are crossed, requiring the construction of small stone drains and some heavy cuttings and fillings. After leaving Suffolk the character of the country changes and becomes somewhat bold—and in order to diminish the quantity of excavation and embankment several undulations in the plane of the Rail Road are unavoidably made—the inclinations are, however, gentle, and the line reaches Blackwater without encountering any other difficulties than an increased expenditure on this portion of it. From Blackwater a level is maintained for some distance, the line passes along the borders of the Swamps which make up to the Highlands, and crossing the Nottoway, on the lands of Mr. Rochelle about seven miles below Jerusalem, it ascends at the rate of 20 feet per mile, passing near Mr. Gurley's to the Cypress Bridge Road. Thence, leaving Vick's Chapel a little to the south and making a slight undulation to avoid some filling, the line arrives at Capt. Barns' Quarter, on the summit of the ridge dividing the waters of the Nottoway from those of the Meherrin. From Captain Barns' a descent is effected on a grade of 20 feet per mile to Buckhorn Run. Thence the line is continued, on a level, across the Meherrin, about a mile above Branch's Bridge. It then ascends, varying from an inclination of 20 to 12 feet per mile, until the summit of the Rail Road is attained, giving an elevation, above the level of tide water, of 144 feet. "Descending from the summit, the Line crosses the Petersburg Rail Road, (on a level with that Road,) about two hundred yards south of Capt. Garey's. It afterwards crosses the head of Raccoon Swamp, and terminates on the North bank of the Roanoke River, opposite Weldon. Its direction is S. 70 W., and its length 77 miles, being only half a mile longer than the distance on a direct line between Portsmouth and Weldon. "The greatest inclination does not exceed 20 feet to the mile, and throughout the whole extent of the Road there are but few deviations from a straight line, and these are effected on the arcs of circles whose radii are in no instance less than 5730 feet, and are most generally 11,460 feet in length. "Gentle inclinations and easy curvatures (when it is necessary to vary from a straight line) are points of essential importance in the location of Rail Roads—these desirable objects as well as a line extremely favorable to the advantageous employment of Locomotive Engines are here attained. Indeed, considering the straightness and the moderate ascents and descents, the performance of an Engine (of given power) will be greater on this, than on any other Rail Road now constructed in the United States. We are therefore enabled to use light Engines, thereby diminishing very considerably the great and leading items in the expense of transportation on Rail Roads, viz. wear and tear and repairs. "The Engine which it is proposed to use will not exceed five tons weight, and its performance on this Road will be equal to that of a six ton Engine, on a Road with 30 feet grades. From this general view it will be seen, that the face of the country is eminently suitable to the proposed work. The intervening Swamps and the alluvial bottom lands of the Nottoway, Blackwater and Meherrin, offer no serious obstacles.—The bottom is every where composed of solid materials, affording a firm foundation for any embankment or other structure it may be necessary to place on it. "Construction of the Road.—It will not be necessary on the present occasion to discuss the relative merits of the various modes of construction— and the variety of materials which have been used in the formation of Rail-Ways. Suffice it to say, that the almost universal substitution of wood for stone, and the iron-edge-rail, establishes its preference in the first instance even where stone is abundant and timber scarce. Among the many reasons for this preference of wood, are—its elasticity, its sufficient stability, and its diminution of the wear and tear of engines and cars. It follows, then as a necessary consequence, that I recommend for your Rail Road the use of timber, which is found in abundance, of excellent quality on almost every part of the line. "The superstructure, then, which I propose to adopt, will be heart pine rails, nine by five inches, plated with iron bars two inches wide, and half an inch thick, resting on white or post oak sills, ten by twelve inches, and eight feet long, placed across the road, five feet apart from centre to centre. The rails will be placed parallel to each other four feet eight and a half inches apart, let into the sills and properly secured by white oak wedges. The sills will be notched for the reception of the rails and wedges and hollowed out in the middle, so as to admit of the construction of a path over them, which will add considerable stiffness to the road, at a very moderate expense—and adapt it to the use of either horse or locomotive power, or both. "Width of Road Bed.—I have estimated for a single rail-way, which for the present will afford sufficient accommodation to the trade and travel. The ditches, however, will be cut and the waste earth disposed with a view to a double track, whenever it may be deemed necessary. The graduated surface of the road-bed in excavations, will vary from 18 to 16 feet in width, the slopes being 45°. The graded surface on embankments will present a uniform width of 12½ feet, with side slopes of 33?° or 1½ base to 1 perpendicular. "Between Suffolk and Spikes' Run we shall pass several small streams by means of stone drains. The stone for this purpose can be readily obtained at Port Deposites, and the work done now, on as reasonable terms as at any other period. Farther on, wooden structures will be thrown over the water courses, with a span affording sufficient room for the erection hereafter of stone or brick culverts. The bridges across the Blackwater, Nottoway and Meherrin Rivers will be supported by abutments and piers of masonry, the stone for which can be transported by water from Norfolk to their respective sites, and will not at most exceed $5 per perch (of 25 cubic feet) delivered. On approaching the Roanoke, rock is found tolerably convenient to the line, and will probably be used in crossing the Oconeechee, Troublefield, and Raccoon Swamp." Population in 1820, 15,465, including that of the borough of Norfolk— exclusive of the borough, 6,987—in 1830, 24,814. Norfolk belongs to the first judicial circuit, and first district. Tax paid in 1832-3, (no report)— in 1833-4, on lots, $1403 63—on land, $1220 23—3280 slaves, $770 00 —1572 horses, $94 32—6 studs, $52 00—33 coaches, $73 00—27 carryalls, $28 00—133 gigs, $87 15—Total, $3728 33. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $482 36—in 1833, $573 40. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Deep Creek, P. V. 123 ms. from R. and 226 from W. Deep creek, is a branch of Elizabeth river. The village is situated near the creek, at the northern extremity of the Dismal Swamp canal. It stands on each side of the canal, near its northern outfall lock, and has indeed been created by the canal. It is now a flourishing depot, being located nearly equidistant between the towns of Norfolk and Portsmouth. It contains 25 dwelling houses, 6 general stores, 2 taverns, 1 house of public worship, free for all denominations, 1 grist mill, 1 saw mill, 2 boot and shoe factories, and 2 tailors. Its commercial business is nearly confined to a trade in large juniper or white cedar shingles, rails, pales, and timber for coopers. It gives constant employment to ten or twelve respectable schooners, which load in the creek, a mile below the locks, and trade to Philadelphia, New York, and other places. These shingles and other juniper lumber, are the produce of the Dismal Swamp, though much of the Swamp has no trees of large growth, but is covered with an almost impenetrable thicket of reeds, grass, and bushes; some parts of it, however, are timbered with gum, beach, pine, and oak; and other parts with juniper and cypress: these latter growing where the water and mud or decayed vegetable matter is deepest. The whole surface of the Swamp is composed of these two substances, and is of various depths, sometimes of 20 feet,—in this (sponge as it is called here) are imbedded innumerable old trees of juniper, from which much of the lumber shipped from Deep Creek is made. It is no uncommon thing to find under the roots of a tree that has been cut for the purpose of making shingles, another and larger old fallen tree, entirely covered with sponge and trees of new growth, which is in a perfectly sound state, and nearly or quite as good for shingles, as the green timber. These shingles, and the other lumber, are brought out of the Swamp, either through ditches cut for the purpose, in narrow, long lighters, or are carted out by mules, on roads made of poles laid across the road, so as to touch each other, forming a bridge or causeway. There are very many miles of such road. The laborers carry the shingles, &amp;c. to these roads from the trees, on their heads or shoulders.— The border of Deep creek is a salt marsh.—In opening a communication from the north outfall lock, through this marsh to the creek, a very large and solid pine stump was found, evidently in the place where it grew. It is in the way of the navigation, and at very low tides, is uncovered. This is the more surprising, as pines do not (in other instances) grow in salt marshes, but delight in a dry, sandy soil. Much labor has been spent, to little purpose, in attempting to remove it. Pine stumps are also found in Albemarle sound, evidently in the same situation in which they grew, though now a number of feet under water, and below the surface of the Ocean. Another geological trait in this part of the state is worthy of notice. Wells dug in the sand to the depth of six, eight, or ten feet, afford good water; but if carried a few feet lower, the stratum of sand is passed, and one of offensive mud is encountered, which destroys the well. There is a traditionary anecdote connected with Deep creek, which deserves to be noticed. During the war of the Revolution, a French vessel was pursued into this creek by an English vessel, and some remains of the Frenchman still continue, to obstruct navigation, and confirm the story; but the tradition adds further, that before the French crew abandoned and sunk their ship, they charged a gun with specie, and threw it overboard, to prevent its falling into the hands of the English, and much time has been spent in a vain search for that gun. Great Bridge, P. O. situated on the southern road 12 miles S. S. E. of Norfolk, 126 S. E. by E. of R. and 229 from W. NORFOLK BOROUGH, Sea Port, and P. O. 114 ms. S. E. by E. of Richmond, and 217 S. S. E. of Washington—in lat 36° 52′, and long. 0° 44′ E. of W. C.—situated 8 miles above Hampton Roads, on the north bank of Elizabeth river, near the junction of its southern and eastern branches. It covers about 600 acres of ground. Norfolk harbor admits vessels of 18 feet draught, and renders the Borough the most commercial depot of Virginia. Its harbor is perhaps surpassed by none in the world, being spacious, safe from all winds, and of easy access to the ocean, for vessels at all seasons of the year. It is completely fortified from foreign enemies by the fortress on Craney Island, and by the works erected at the outlet of Hampton Roads, by the U. S. Government. It is within a few hour's sail of the Potomac, Rappahannock, York, and James rivers. The advantages which it possesses have attracted the attention of the General Government, which has expended immense sums in the erection of a Navy Yard, Dry Dock, and Marine Hospital, on a scale, and in a style, suited to the great naval depot of this Union. The close connection existing between Norfolk and North Carolina, by means of the Dismal Swamp Canal, causes large quantities of produce from that state to find their way through this channel to market. In addition to this, the Portsmouth Rail Road, (to be completed in 1835,) will open to its enterprising citizens an extensive back country, abounding in every production of our soil and climate. Previous to the late war, Norfolk monopolized almost all the trade with the British West Indies, which was a source of much profit to her merchants. From that period, however, with the exception of the years 1816, '17 and '18, during which, the restriction was removed, her commerce has been in a languishing condition; till the opening of the canal, and other causes, again brought it into healthy action. Large quantities of corn, lumber, and naval stores are annually shipped from this port to Europe, the West Indies, and South America. It is already an extensive cotton market, and destined to deal in that article to still greater extent. The city presents a handsome view from the water. The streets, in consequence of the numerous creeks running into the town from every direction, are laid out without any regard to order or regularity; many buildings, with stone fronts, and in improved style, have been erected within a few years, and real estate has greatly increased in value within the same period. Its health, too, has improved in a remarkable degree, owing doubtless to the paving of the streets, proper draining, and better water, by means of cisterns, which last are very common. The domestic government consists of a Mayor, Alderman, &amp; Common Council; the first and last being chosen annually by the people. The public buildings are, a custom house, court house, almshouse, academy, and primary school house, a maritime hospital, Mason's lodge, 8 houses of public worship, (2 Episcopalian, 2 Methodist, 1 Baptist, 1 Presbyterian, 1 Catholic, and 1 for colored people) There is 1 theatre, 1 free school, 18 private seminaries, 2 printing offices,—each issuing news papers—a news room, and an extensive, public library. A lyceum, and infant school house, of beautiful design, have been erected by the liberality of private individuals. There are 3 Banks,—U States Bank, Virginia Bank, and Farmers' Bank of Virginia—ten steamboats ply from Norfolk to Baltimore, Richmond, and other places There are 10 hote's, 3 steam mills, 3 tanyards, 2 rope walks, and every mechanical pursuit is carried on. An Admiralty Court, a Superior Court of Law, and a Monthly Court, conduct the administration of justice. There are also, a mechanic's society, a humane, and a marine society, 2 volunteer companies of Infantry, 1 of Artillery, 1 Rifle, and 1 Cavalry company. A cemetery covering several acres of ground has been laid out by the corporation, and tastefully planted in evergreens, which adds much to the beauty of the place. Norfolk, except Williamsburg, is the oldest incorporated town in Virginia, deriving its charter from the British Government. The market abounds in fish, oysters, vegetables, &amp;c of the choicest kinds. The chief imports are, coffee, rum, salt, sugar, and molasses. Popution about 10,000 persons.

This county was one of the original shires of 1634, under the name of Accomac shire, and was changed to its present name in 1643.—It is bounded N. by Accomac,—W. and S. by Chesapeake bay, and E. by the Atlantic Ocean. Its length from S. to N. is 32 miles, its mean width, if the Atlantic Islands are included, 10, and its area 320 square miles. It extends in lat. from 37° 05′ to 37° 33′, and in long from 1° to 1° 28′ E. of W. C.— Paramore's, Hog's, Prout's, and Smith's islands cover the Atlantic coast of nearly the whole county. "The county of Northampton is the southern extremity of the long, low peninsula which forms the eastern side of the Chesapeake, and which comprehends eight counties in Maryland and two in Virginia. Separated as these counties are from the rest of the state, by the spacious bay, which the eye can scarcely see across, and being among the first settled parts of the colony, they are a more unmixed people than is often to be found in our country, and retain more of the usages, and even language of former times, than perhaps any part of the state. The ancient hospitality of Virginia is here found unimpaired; and the inhabitants have a high relish for good living, which they are also enabled to indulge by a soil and climate extremely favorable to gardening, and by an abundance of excellent fish, oysters, and crabs. They preserve great neatness in their houses and persons, which is a characteristic of persons living in a sandy country. The whole county is as level as a bowling-green, and the roads are good at all seasons of the year. This circumstance has probably increased the social character and habits of the people, as it certainly has their pleasure carriages. The number of gigs in the county, is near three hundred, which is considerably greater than that of the free holders. It is computed that the county pays about $10,000 a year for its carriages. "The soil of this county is thin, light, and always more or less mixed with sand; but as it commonly rests on a stiff clay, and the land is too level to be carried off by the rains, or to "to wash," to use a term of the upper country, the inhabitants are very much encouraged to pursue an improving course of husbandry; yet in truth they are but indifferent farmers. They cultivate the same land incessantly, one year in Indian corn, and the next in oats, (their two principal crops,) and their lands improve under this severe process, provided they are not also pastured. Whenever a field is not in cultivation, it puts up every where a rich luxuriant crop of a sort of wild vetch, called the magotty-bay bean, which shades the land while it is growing, and returns to it a rich coat of vegetable manure. It is by means of this fertilizing plant, and the aliment which is plentifully furnished by the vapors from the sea, that the product of these lands is so much greater than a stranger would be led to expect from the appearance of the soil. The land is so easily cultivated, that there are few parts of the state in which more is produced to the man, or the horse, though more may be produced to the acre. On the best farms, an hundred barrels to the hand are often obtained. The fig and the pomegranate flourish without protection during the winter. The former attains the size of a stout tree, some times twenty feet high, and its delicious fruit is in greater abundance than the inhabitants can consume. They have not yet learned the art of curing it, or perhaps the species they have, is not suited to that operation. "Wind mills are in use here, but tide mills, at the mouth of small inlets, are preferred when attainable. These inlets deeply indent the shore, both on the `bay and sea side,' and while they are convenient for fishing, shooting wild fowls, and as harbors for their boats and small craft, they give a pleasing variety to the landscapes, which are indeed as pretty as is compatible with so unvarying a surface. Upon the whole, we know of no part of the state in which the comforts of life are enjoyed in greater number, or higher perfection. They have too, the sea and land breezes of the West Indies; which temper the sultry heats of summer; and their only annoyances seem to be a few musquetoes, a good many gnats, and now and then a bilious or intermittent fever. There is here an article of culture which is not much met with in other parts of the state—it is the palma christi, called castor bean. It now constitutes a part of almost every farmer's crop, to the extent of eight to ten acres or more. The quantity of the nut or bean produced, is the same as the land would produce in corn. Each bushel yields about two gallons and a half of oil, and sells, at the press, for $1 25 a bushel. This plant is now cultivated in many of the counties on the Western Shore, and the oil it affords has become a considerable article of export, being preferred to that of the West Indies. "Among the curiosities of this county, are the ancient records of the county from 1640, and a marble tomb, or sarcophagus, about five feet high, and as many long, from which we transcribe the following singular inscription: Under this marble tomb lies the body of the Honorable John Custis, Esq. of the City of Williamsburg, and Parish of Burton. Formerly of Hungar's parish, on the Eastern Shore of Virginia and county of Northampton, Aged 71 years, &amp; yet lived but seven years, which was the space of time he kept A Bachelor's home at Arlington on the Eastern Shore of Virginia. On the opposite side one reads This inscription put on this tomb was by his own positive orders. Wm. Cosley Man, in Fenchurch street, fecit, London. The writer was so intent on perpetuating his troubles, that he has not mentioned the time of his birth, nor did those who came after him supply the omission, or state the time of his death; but it probably occurred early in the Last Century." It is certainly a strong caution against the married state. Population in 1820, 7,705—in 1830, 8,644. Northampton belongs to the third judicial circuit, and second district. Taxes paid in 1832-3, $1967 49—in 1833-4, on land, $99 18—1970 slaves, $492 50—1506 horses, $70 36—8 studs, $140 00—13 coaches, $28 00—17 carryalls, $17 00— 250 gigs, $224 70—Total, $99 2 74.

It is situated at the eastern base of the Blue Ridge; bounded by Spottsylvania, E. and S. E.; Louisa, S. Albemarle, S. W. Blue Ridge, separating it from Rockingham, W. by Conway river, separating it from Madison, N. W. and by Rapid Ann river, separating it from Culpeper N. Its length diagonally from E. to W. is 56 ms.; mean width 10 ms.; and area 560 sq. ms.—Extending in lat. from 38° 07′, to 38° 25′ N. and in long. from 0° 42′, to 1° 45′ W. of Washington City. The northern part in its entire length, is bounded by, and drained into Rapid Ann, or S. W. branchof Rappahannock; its declivity is eastward. The S. E. angle gives source to the North Anna, and the S. W. to the extreme northern sources of the Rivanna river. The surface is hilly and the country is nearly equally divided by the S. W. mountain. No country can excel it in the salubrity of its atmosphere, or the purity of its water, which in some instances is highly chalybeate, from the large masses of iron ore found imbedded in its soil. The quality of its soil is in general very fertile. In the upper or mountainous division, it is of a deep orange color, (whence its name) very productive and well adapted to the use of plaister and clover, the fertilizing effects of which, are visible upon many of the farms in this section. In the lower or S. E. division, the soil, which is of a white, sandy character, is much less fertile and not so easily improved as the red mountain land. There is a vein of limestone passing through this county, in a line nearly parallel with the mountains, which has in some places been opened and worked to advantage. Its mineral wealth is very great, a vein of copper ore, has been discovered in the Blue Ridge, not far rom Swift Run Gap, which is supposed to be valuable. Iron abounds in the vicinity of the mountains, and in the lower section of the county, not far from the Spottsylvania line, gold has been obtained, in considerable quantities. There are at present several mines in successful operations; the principal of which, are Grymes', the Greenwood, Coalter's and Grasty's, at which latter place, the Virginia Mining Company, has been at considerable expense in erecting machinery for grinding the rock. There is an Indian Mound in this county, on the lands of Mr. Jacob Walters, on the Rapid Ann river, near the boundary between Orange and Madison. This mound has been discovered, for nearly 120 years: but no description of it has hitherto been published. The bodies lie with their heads towards the N. The mound is probable between 12 and 15 ft. higher than its base, and of very considerable length. The bodies lie in tiers, one above another, and about 2 ft. apart. It is supposed, that some Indian battle was fought here at some remote period, and there is every appearance of some of the bodies having been burned before interment, as there are frequently found among the skeletons burned bones, and pieces of coal. The sight is truly awful to one who is not in the habit of seeing the bones of human beings. The mound is about 30 ft sq and appears to contain between 3 and 400 of these skeletons. Pieces of scalping knives and tomahawks, are frequently found near this spot of Indian interment. The staple productions of this county are wheat, rye, oats, corn, hemp, flax and tobacco. The wheat is mostly ground into flour at the mills within the county, of which there are 8. Houses were erected in 1833 for the reception of the poor, where they are supplied with all the comforts of life at the annual expense to the county of about $2,000. There is an institution in this county, which was incorporated some years since, under the name of the Orange Humane Society, for the education of indigent youths:—it has a capital of upwards of $20,000, which is loaned out to individuals upon good, real and personal security, the interest arising from which, is applied to the education of such youths of promise as are destitute. Orange is entitled to send 1 member, under the new constitution to the assembly. Population in 1820, 12,913—1830, 14,637. Taxes paid in 1833, $3,796 15—in 1834, on lots, $16 98—on land, $2,419 94—3,768 slaves, $942 00—3,138 horses, $188 28—11 stus, $150 00—44 coaches, $91 45—24 carryalls, $24 00—35 gigs, $19 85. Total, $3,852 50. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $333 78 —in 1833, no commisioner's report. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Barboursville, P.

Patrick county was established by the Legislature in 1791, and taken from Henry Co. Patrick is a border county, extending along the State line between Virginia and North Carolina, a distance of between 45 and 50 miles. It is bounded on the N. by the Blue Ridge mountains, which in running W. approach so near the Carolina line, as to make the county very narrow at its western extremity. In fact the county formerly extended to the point where the mountain intersected the state line; but a considerable portion of its former western extremity has been added to the county of Grayson, for the convenience of the people residing therein. The contiguous counties on the N. and W. are the trans-montane counties of Floyd and Grayson; on the E. it is bounded by the counties of Franklin and Henry. Its width varies from 30 to 80 miles, averaging something like 20 miles; and its area is 541 sq ms. It extends in lat. from 36° 30′ to 30° 47′ N. and in long from 2° 56′ to 3° 40′ W. of W. C. The general face of the county is broken, but not as much so as that of most of the piedmont counties to the eastward of it. It is intersected however by several considerable mountains ranging from E. to W. The principal of these is the Bull Mountain, which unites with the main mountain at its western extremity, and runs eastwardly nearly to the eastern boundary of the county, dividing it (not very unequally) from W. to E. The Court House is situated on the S. side of this mountain at the distance of 3 or 4 miles from its summit, which is as near as a suitable situation could be procured, on account of the spurs of the mountain. There is another mountain (which may be considered a spur of the Blue Ridge) called Carter's mountain. It leaves the main mountain S. of the Bull mountain and ranges nearly parallel with it, inclining a little more to the S. This mountain is not very long, extending in length not more than 8 or 10 miles. It lies very near the Courthouse, immediately S. of it, and terminates nearly opposite to it. The No Business mountain runs also parallel with the Bull mountain, on the S. side of it, but lies detached from the main mountain near the eastern end of the county. It is probably 7 or 8 miles long, and ranges pretty much in a line with Carter's mountain, there being however an interval of 4 or 5 miles between the eastern end of the one and the western end of the other. These are all the mountains which have acquired a distinct name and character; there are however a great number of spurs and knobs, which though nameless, might well deserve some distinguishing appellation. These generally extend out from the Blue Ridge in various directions and for various distances. The principal water courses are the Dan, Smith's river, the Moyos, and the Ararat, with their tributaries;—all which not only intersect the county, but have their sources in the mountains which form its northwestern border. The Dan rises in a plain on the top of the Blue Ridge, some 8 or 10 miles from the declivity of the mountain, and running to the S. waters an extensive and level body of land called the meadows of Dan. It then breaks through the mountain, or rather tumbles down the mountain, and struggling on for 8 or 10 miles among stupendous cliffs and precipices, reaches the level country, not far from the State line, and crosses into North Carolina. This stream crosses the county within about 10 miles of its western extremity. 33 The Ararat also rises on the flat table land on the top of the mountain, not very remote from the head of the Dan, but takes a different direction. It runs to the S. W. and crossing the state line near the western extremity of the county, takes its way through the county of Surry, N. C. and empties into the Yadkin. Smith's river has its source in the Blue Ridge to the N. of the Bull mountain, and traversing that section of the county lying between the Bull and Blue Ridge mountains from W. to E., crosses near the eastern extremity of the Bull mountain into the county of Henry. There are two Mayos, the South Mayo and North Mayo. The South Mayo rises in the main mountain, between the Bull mountain and Carter's mountain, and running southeastwardly between those two mountains, passes by the Court House, and crossing the south side of the country diagonally, enters North Carolina near the southeastern corner of the county. The North Mayo rises in the Bull mountain, on its S. side, and running eastwardly for some distance between that mountain and the No Business mountain, turns to the S. around the eastern extremity of the last named mountain, and enters North Carolina, first passing through a small corner of the county of Henry.—The two Mayos unite soon after leaving Virginia, and finally empty into the Dan. There are many creeks tributary to the rivers already enumerated, a few of the principal of which shall be given. First those which empty into Dan. This stream receives before it descends the mountain, Ivy Creek, as large as itself: after it descends the mountain, it receives a number of small streams not worthy of notice;—near where it crosses into North Carolina, it receives Archy's creek from the S. W. and soon after crossing the line it receives little Dan from the N. which also rises in Patrick. The Ararat receives after it descends the mountain, Doe run and Johnson's creek, from the N. and Clark's creek from the S. Smith's river receives Rock Castle creek, Widgeon creek, and several other smaller ones from the N. and Sycamore and Goblin Town creek, from the S. The South Mayo receives Spoon creek from the N., and Russell's creek from the S., besides other smaller ones. The North Mayo receives Mill creek from the the S., and Roger's creek from the N. There is a great diversity of soil in the county of Patrick. The numerous water courses which intersect it in every direction afford more or less bottom land of good quality, and a large portion of the upland is strong, though often steep and rocky. The soil and climate below the mountain are adapted to the culture of corn, wheat, rye, oats, tobacco and hemp. The land on the top of the mountain before alluded to, as being contiguous to the head of Dan, and designated as the meadows of Dan, is generally fertile, and while the climate is too cold for the successful culture of corn or tobacco, it is admirably adapted to the production of small grain and grass. This body of land is at present included in large surveys, made on speculation, which have not generally come into market; notwithstanding which it is rapidly settling and, without doubt, is destined to be the most flourishing part of the county. The access to it, though somewhat difficult on the S. and E., is entirely easy on the N. and W., as the descent of the mountain in those directions, is scarcely perceptible. The staple article of produce, on the south side of the Bull mountain is tobacco. On the N. side of that mountain there can scarcely be said to be a staple. The people live independently, mostly within themselves and generally sell their surplus grain, pork, beef, brandy, &amp;c. The principal portion of the slave population is on the south side of the county, which may in some measure account for the article of tobacco being more raised on that side than on the other. The mountain section of the county is beginning already in some degree to be, and is destined soon to be entirely, a grazing country: admirably calculated for the raising of cattle, horses and hogs.—The tobacco raised in the county is mostly manufactured and sold in the southern and western States. Immense quantities of this article are annually sent to the States of South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama, and sold at good prices for cash. Nearly every planter who raises tobacco to any extent is a manufacturer; but there are some who make a business of it, and purchase the article in the leaf from their neighbors, without prizing, at a very liberal price. Land is quite cheap compared with land of similar quality farther eastward, and in consequence there has been for some years back an annual accession of population by immigration from the lower counties. This accession has however been more than counterbalanced in the last two or three years, by the prevalence of the Missouri mania, which has carried many of our best citizens to that State, and which still prevails though in an abated degree. The climate of this county is truly delightful. The bracing air of the mountain, combined with the mild breath of the south, renders the atmosphere pure and at the same time soft,—and we do not believe there is a healthier climate in the world. For many years in some neighborhoods there was not a physician within twenty miles; (which our correspondent writes,) "you may consider either as the cause or effect of the health of my vicinity, which ever you like." There are no manufactories in the county, except those of tobacco, already referred to; and a forge owned by John A. Hairston, Esq. on Goblin Town creek, on the north side of the Bull mountain, near its eastern extremity. This forge has been in operation for many years, and the enterprising proprietor, in conjunction with two connections, men of capital as well as himself, is now erecting a large furnace within a short distance of the forge, which will go into operation during the next fall or winter. The supply of ore is abundant, convenient, and of the best quality. Iron ore abounds in other parts of the county also. "The scenery presented by the passage of Dan river down the mountain, and into the flat country, is awful and sublime in the highest degree. The river rises in a plain, traverses it for 8 or 10 miles, till it reaches the declivity of the mountain, dashes down it by a rapid succession of perpendicular falls, and winds its solitary way, unapproached by any footstep save that of the mountain hunter, and hemmed in on every side by immense mountains, descending almost perpendicularly to the water edge for the distance of several miles, before its banks afford room for settlements. The Pinnacles of Dan are found in this interval. To approach them you must ascend the mountain at some convenient gap—upon reaching the top of the mountain, the country becomes comparatively level. The visiter goes along the top under the guidance of some mountaineer, who knows the locality of the pinnacles; he meets with no obstruction except fallen logs, and a most luxuriant growth of weeds, till suddenly he reaches the declivity of the mountain. An immense basin presents itself to his view, surrounded by lofty mountains, almost perpendicular, of which the ridge on which he stands forms a boundary. The depth of the basin is beyond his view and appears to him to be incalculable. From the midst of the basin two pinnacles, in the shape of a sugar loaf, rise to a level with the surrounding mountains, and of course with the beholder. They appear to be masses of rock rudely piled on each other, with barely soil enough in the crevices to nourish a few bushes. There is no visible outlet to the basin, the narrow chasm through which the river makes its escape being out of view. If the visiter wishes to ascend the main pinnacle, (one being much larger than the other,) he descends from his station, the face of the mountain which is very steep, to a distance which he imagines sufficient to carry him down the highest mountain,—when he reaches a narrow ridge or pass-way not more than thirty feet wide, connecting at the distance of thirty or forty yards, the pinnacle to the main mountain,—and to his astonishment the river appears at an incalculable distance below him. The ascent of the pinnacle then commences and an arduous and somewhat perilous one it is. A narrow pathway winds up among the rocks, and in many places, the adventurous climber has to pull himself up a perpendicular ascent of five or six feet by the bushes. When he reaches the top, however, he is amply repaid for his labor in ascending. The prospect, though necessarily a limited one, is picturesque and sublime in a high degree. The view of the basin is then complete. The mountains surrounding it nearly of an uniform height; no outlet visible and the beholder perched upon the summit of an immense natural pyramid in the centre. The river is seen occasionally as it winds around the base of the pinnacle. It attempts to pass on the west side where the narrow ridge by which the visiter approaches arrests its course; it then winds entirely round the pinnacle close to its base until it comes to the opposite or southern side of the narrow ridge, passing between the two pinnacles it then passes round the western and southern side of the smaller pinnacle, and makes its escape as it best can from its apparently hopeless imprisonment. The summit of the pinnacle is about twenty or thirty feet square,—and strange to relate, small bushes of the aspin grow upon it—which is found no where else growing wild in this section of country. The echo produced is somewhat remarkable. If a gun be fired off on the top of the pinnacle, you hear nothing for several seconds, when suddenly in the direction of the narrow pass through which the river flows, a rushing sound is heard, which although not a correct echo, seems to be the sound of the report escaping through the pass."* * I have given you this imperfect description of this pinnacle of Dan from my own personal view and experience, having visited them on the 4th of July some years ago in company with several friends, and fired a salute from the top of the main pinnacle. I can therefore vouch for its fidelity, if I cannot recommend it for its clearness or beauty. "The other natural curiosity to which reference has been made is "the Bursted rock," which is not very far from the Pinnacles, and forms a part of the frowning and sublime scenery which overhangs the Dan, in its passage through the mountain. You approach it as you do the pinnacle along the level top of the mountain, till suddenly your course is arrested by a perpendicular descent of many hundred feet. The face of the precipice is a smooth rock. Far below every thing appears in ruins rocks piled on rocks,—the timber swept from the earth; and every appearance indicates that a considerable portion of the mountain has been, by some great convulsion of nature, riven and torn from the rest and precipitated into the valley, or rather chasm below.

Population 200 persons, of whom 3 are attorneys, and 2 practising physicians. County Courts are held on the 3d Monday in every month; Quarterly, in March, June, August and November. Judge Saunders holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 20th of May and October. Danville, P. V. 168 ms. from R. and 258 from W. Danville is a flourishing village, situated at the falls on the right bank of Dan river, near the S. border of the county, and about 5 ms. from the N. C. line Dan river is navigable for batteaux 40 ms. above this place. Danville was incorporated in pursuance of an act of the Legislature in 1831-2. It contains about 115 houses, 9 miscellaneous stores, 3 groceries, 2 commission houses, 2 tobacco warehouses, 2 Branch Banks, (Virginia and Farmers,) 1 masonic hall, at present used as a place of public worship by all denominations, 1 male and 1 female academy, in a flourishing condition, also a private seminary for young ladies, with upwards of 40 pupils,—1 well organized sunday school, 1 apothecary shop, 2 tobacco factories, 1 oil mill, 2 manufacturing flour mills, 3 saw mills, 1 iron foundry, and 2 taverns.

W. by W. of R. and 228 from W., situated 4 ms. S. of Ward's bridge on the post road leading from Lynchburg to Danville, 30 ms. S. of the former, and 40 N. of the latter place. This section of country is healthy, and well watered; the soil moderately fertile, well adapted to the culture of tobacco and grain. The growth of timber is generally oak, pine, hickory, &amp;c. Liberty Hall, P. O. 121 ms. S. W. by W. of R. Monroeton, P. O. on the right bank of Staunton river, in the extreme north western angle of the county, 161 ms. S. W. by W. of R. and 239 from W. This place some 10 or 12 years ago, promised fair to become a town of some magnitude. It was laid off in lots, and a considerable number of them sold, several houses were built and occupied, and one or two stores established; but by some fatality, it had no sooner commenced its career, than it begun to decline, and every one of the first settlers left the place, and most of the houses were thrown down; others moved off and rebuilt where they were of more service, and it now contains only 2 families, 1 tannery, and 1 manufacturing flour mill. Mount Airy, P. O. 164 ms. S. W. of R. and 242 from W., situated in the lower end of the county, in a healthy and flourishing neighborhood, about 5 miles from Halifax county line, at the intersection of the roads leading from Lynchburg to Danville and Milton, and the road leading from Charlotte to Franklin C. H., 39 ms. from the former, 32 from Danville, and 16 N. E. of Pittsylvania C. H. It has 1 mercantile store, several dwelling houses, a saw and grist mill, and 2 cotton machines are in the neighborhood, and 3 houses of public worship, 1 Episcopalian, 1 Methodist, and 1 Baptist.

It is situated 18 ms. N. of Danville, and 8 E. of Competition. It contains a country store, house of entertainment, and a blacksmith shop. There is a Baptist house of worship in the neighborhood, called "Shockoe meeting house." The soil in the immediate neighborhood is not very fertile, The productions are tobacco, wheat, corn, oats, &amp;c.: that of the surrounding country is more so, being well adapted to wheat; large crops of which will probably be raised as soon as the Roanoke improvements, which are now in a state of forwardness, shall have been completed. Sugar Tree, P. O. 20 ms. to the S. W. of Competition, 187 ms. S. W. by W. of R. and 280 S. S. W. of W. It contains 4 mercantile stores, 1 Methodist house of worship, 1 common school, and 1 sunday school, 1 manufacturing flour mill, and 1 blacksmith shop. The lands in this neighborhood are generally good, except immediately on the public road. There are several small streams which pass through this part of the county and empty into Dan river. Watkins' Store, P. O. in the S. W. angle of the county, 192 ms. S. W. by W. of R. and 285 from W. Williams' Store, P. O. 152 ms. from R. and 242 from W. POWHATAN. Powhatan was created by the Legislature in 1777, and formed out of a part of Cumberland county. It is bounded on the N. by James river, which separates it from Goochland—on the E. by Chesterfield—on the S. by the Appomattox river, which separates it from Amelia, and on the W. by Cumberland. It is situated about 37° 30′ N. lat. and 1° long. W. of W. C., extending about 30 miles in length, and averaging about 14 in breadth, with an area of 280 sq. ms. The face of the county is level as a territory; although undulating with small sinks and swells, or bottoms and hills running from the main ridge, which passes through the centre of the county E. and W. to the James and Appomattox rivers. The James river washes the whole extent of the northern frontier from W. to E. and the Appomattox the southern frontier in like manner and direction. The creeks are numerous: those which empty into James river beginning near the Cumberland line, on the N. W. and proceeding E. to the Chesterfield line are, Muddy creek, which rises in Cumberland, runs in a meandering direction N. and empties into James river between Cumberland and Powhatan. On this creek there is a manufacturing mill, called Muddy creek mills near Cartersville. Deep creek rises in Cumberland, runs N. E. receiving the tributary waters of Little Deep creek, Indian Camp creek, Moore's creek, Mosby's and Horsepen Branches, Swann's creek, and Sallee's creek, all empty into James river some 7 or 8 miles below the mouth of Muddy creek. On Sallee's creek are situated two grist mills. Jefferson creek rises in Powhatan, runs N. and empties into James river, at the town of Jefferson. Mohawk creek, rises in Powhatan runs N. and empties into James river, one mile above Michaux's Ferry; on this creek is situated one grist mill. Fine creek rises near Powhatan C. H. runs 8 or 10 miles N. E. and empties into James river. On this creek is situated the Fine creek manufacturing and grist mills. Jones' creek rises in Powhatan, runs 12 miles E. and N. E. and empties into James river. On this creek are situated a manufacturing and grist mill, also another merchant mill running 2 pair of burrs, to which is connected a grist and saw mill, with 1 general store. On this creek are also located a cotton factory and 2 other grist mills, with 1 saw mill. Burner's creek rises in Powhatan, runs 7 or 8 miles N. E. and empties into James river, near the line between Chesterfield and Powhatan. Those in the southern part of the county beginning at the lower end and proceeding upwards or westwards are—Swift creek, which rises in Powhatan, runs S. E. through Chesterfield into Appomattox; on this creek in Powhatan are situated the Cedar Grove manufacturing and grist mills. Hurricane creek rises in Powhatan, runs S. and empties into Swift creek, 3 miles long. Skin Quarter creek rises in Powhatan, runs 8 miles S. W. and empties into Appomattox. Butterwood creek rises in Powhatan, runs 7 or 8 miles S. W. and empties into Appomattox; on this creek Haskins' mill, near Genito, is situated. Genito creek rises in Powhatan, runs S. W. and empties into Appomattox—3 miles long. Lower Fighting creek rises near Rocky Oak meeting house, runs S. W. receiving Scott's creek and Hobson's creek, unites with Upper Fighting creek, and empties into Appomattox. Upper Fighting creek rises near the Buckingham road, runs S. E. receiving. Tucker's and Blunt's creeks, unites with Lower Fighting creek, and empties into Appomattox. Between the mouth of this creek and the Cumberland line, there are many branches, and small creeks running through almost every plantation. There are two principal roads running through the county—the Buckingham road, on the high ridge between the two rivers, and the Manakin Town road, between the Buckingham road and James river, together with numerous cross roads. The soil of Powhatan is various both in quality and appearance. The old farms have been much exhaused by long and injudicious cultivation, but a revival of a geological spirit, with the use of clover and plaster, seems to authorise the prediction that in twenty years the land of this county will again become fertile. The James and Appomattox rivers bounding two sides of the county at full length, afford great quanties of rich low grounds, and thousands of little branches and creeks intersecting and variegating every portion of the county, render the soil quite productive generally. The principal crops are corn, oats, wheat and tobacco. The last two are the staple products. There are some coal mines in the lower end of this county. A pit has been for several years regularly and profitably managed by the judicious owner, Capt. Wm. Finney, in whose immediate neighborhood another vein of coal has been discovered on the land of Mr. Edward Scott. Indications of coal have also been discovered on the surface of the earth in many places in the lower end of the county. There are ten male schools now in operation in this county, under the superintendence of competent teachers for the instruction of youth in the ordinary branches of education. There are also two female schools under the management of judicious and able teachers. The Baptists, Methodists and Presbyterians, are the only regularly formed churches. There are some Episcopalians, but no officiating minister of that denomination. The old Episcopal churches, Peterville and Manakin Town, have become free for the use of all denominations. There is also a church recently established in the lower end of the county called the Reformed Baptist, now composed of 12 members. There are also many Unitarians in the county, but no established church of that faith. Powhatan belongs to the seventh judicial circuit and fourth district. Population in 1820, 8,292—1830, 8,517 persons, of whom more than half were slaves and free blacks. Tax paid in 1833, $2752 46—in 1834 on lots, $45 58—on land, $1512 58—3049 slaves, $762 25—1791 horses, $107 46—3 studs, $100 00—86 coaches, $198 75—16 carryalls, $16 00 —89 gigs, $50 25. Total, $2792 87. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $106 84—in 1833, $45 36. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Ballsville, P. O. 48 ms. from R. and 147 from W. Flat Rock, P. O. in the eastern part of the county, 25 ms. W. of R. and 147 from W. Genito, P. V. 29 miles S.

It contains 6 dwelling houses, 1 mercantile store, a tavern, blacksmith, and a tailor's shop. A permanent bridge is thrown across the Appomattox at this place, at which is situated a large manufacturing flour mill. Population 25 persons; of whom 1 is a physician. Jefferson, P. V. is pleasantly situated on the south bank of James river, 35 ms. above R. 144 from W. and 7 ms. from the county seat. It has a direct water communication with Richmond, being situated only 12 ms. above the head of the James river canal. The elevation of this place affords the most beautiful prospect of the surrounding country, of any town or village on James river. From a farm half a mile below and in sight of Jefferson, may be seen the farms and residences of 8 wealthy 34 and extensive farmers in the county of Goochland, besides some four or five in the county of Powhatan, and from the same place there is a desirable prospect of James river, both up and down. It is a place of considerable trade for its size. The exports are principally wheat and tobacco. They ship annually about 40,000 bushels of wheat, and 250 hhds. of tobacco. It contains besides a public ferry, 2 stores, 1 manufacturing mill, 1 tailor shop, 2 shoemakers, and 1 saddler and harness maker. The mail from Richmond arrives at this place 3 times a week. It has besides houses of deposite, 8 dwelling houses; with a white population of 50—and a population of 70 colored persons. SCOTTSVILLE, P. V. and seat of justice, 32 ms. W. of R. and 139 S. S. W. of W. in lat 37°32′ and long 0° 56′ W. of W. C. This village contains, besides the Court House, Clerk's office and jail, 20 dwelling houses, 3 miscellaneous stores, a tanyard, saddler, boot and shoe maker, 2 tailors, 1 blacksmith shop, and 3 taverns. County Courts are held on the 3d Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, May, August and Nov'r. Judge Clopton holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 8th April and 1st October. Smithsville, P. V. 38 ms. W. of R. and 132 from W., situated between two creeks—Deep creek on the W. and Sallee's creek on the E. It contains several dwelling houses, a house of public worship, (Presbyterian,) called "Mount Carmel," 1 country store, 1 house of entertainment, a plough maker, and blacksmith shop; in the vicinity and on Sallee's creek, there is located a manufacturing flour mill, the proprietors of which have it in contemplation to extend the navigation of the creek to James river. There are several benevolent societies organized in this vicinity. Population 30. Sublett's Tavern, P. O. in the eastern part of the county, 23 ms. S. W. of R. and 145 from W. PRINCE EDWARD. Prince Edward was created by the legislature in 1753, and was formed out of a portion of Amelia Co. It is bounded S. E. by Lunenburg, S. and S. W. by Charlotte, W. by Campbell, N. W. and N. by Buckingham, N. E. by Cumberland and Amelia, and E. by Nottoway. Its length from E. to W. is 35 ms.; mean breadth 12 ms. and area 420 sq. ms.—Its mean lat. is 37° 12′, and long from W. C. 1° 30′ W. The Appomattox river, separates this county from Buckingham and Cumberland. This county is well watered by numerous creeks, emptying into the Appomattox river. They come in the following order, viz.: Vaughan's, and Harris' creeks: Buffaloe—This creek was examined a few years ago, and it was contemplated to make it navigable for boats, in conjunction with the little Roanoke, in Charlotte. The Engineer made an unfavorable report. Briery, Bush and Sandy creeks. These creeks all run nearly parallel. Briery is a sluggish stream, Buffaloe and Bush swift. The Appomattox is a fine stream, narrow but very deep. The soil in this county is very good. The gray land predominates. It is of a sandy texture, and well adapted to corn and tobacco. Much of the land presents the same appearance as the state does generally. It has been exhausted by continual culture, without any regard to system. A large quantity of it is unenclosed. The pine in this county, as in most parts of the state, takes possession of the worn out land, and renders much aid in restoring the lands. Prince Edward is rich in minerals and fosils. In the last few years there have been many developments of its mineral wealth. Numerous beds of calcarious rock or marl, have been discovered; and from indications, it is probable that it may be found in large quantities. Near Farmville, and in other parts of the county there are very strong indications, that coal of the finest quality may be obtained. It may be found by digging a little way, and it is to be regretted, that regular attempts have not been made to explore these mines of wealth. If the navigation of the Appomattox is improved, at no distant day, coal may be a source of much wealth to this county. Copper ore has been found in various parts of the county very pure. There are some indications of gold, but not very strong. There is one solitary mountain in this county, "Leigh's mountain." It is an axact cone, and adds something to the scenery. It is between Bush and Sandy rivers. Farmville, is a town of considerable commercial importance. It is situated at the head of batteaux navigation on the Appomattox: however, boats can get up much higher. This is the fourth tobacco market in Virginia, and in point of the quality of its tobaacco, it is the first. More than half a million of dollars are annually paid here for tobacco. The trade of Farmville is drawn from Halifax, Lunenburg, Charlotte, Nottoway and a part of Campbell. Hampden Sydney College was founded in 1774 for the purpose of cherishing those ideas of civil and religious liberty which were beginning at that time to be diffused. It was chartered in 1783 and received its present name from those two martyrs to liberty, J. Hampden and A. Sydney. It was established and has ever been supported by the private munificence of public spirited individuals. It has an elevated and pleasant situation, 1 mile from the C. H. and 80 ms. S. W. of Richmond. The healthiness of its situation is well known, there having been but one death among the students since its foundation. The annual income of the funds of the Institution has not, until recently exceeded $600; but within the last 5 years, it has received a contribution of $30,000, of which $20,000 have been set apart for a permanent fund. The only assistance it has ever received from the state was 2 small tracts of escheated lands, which were of very little value. Although the Institution has had to encounter many difficulties for want of funds, yet it has generally been in successful operation and has educated upwards of 2,000 young men; many of whom have been of eminent usefulness, and some of great abilities. More instructors have emanated from this Institution than from any other in the southern country. Connected with the College is a Literary and Philosophical Society, and an Institute of Education. There are also several societies among the students, which are of great aisistance to them in the prosecution of their studies. The legislative government of the College is vested in 27 trustees who fill up vacancies in their own body. The Presidents of Hampden Sidney have been Rev. S. S. Smith, from 1774 to 1779. Rev. J. B. Smith, from 1779, to 1789. Pres. pro. tem. 1789, to 1797. Rev. A. Alexander, D. D. 1777, to 1806. Rev. M. Hoge, D. D. 1807, to 1820. J. P. Cushing A. M. 1821. Besides the President there are Professorships of Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, Mathematics, and Language. The number of students for the last 15 years has averaged about 100. The number of matriculates this year is 69. It has a valuable and extensive Chemical and Philosophical Apparatus and a library of about 5,000 vols. The buildings connected with College are the College edifice, 190 ft. by 50, 4 stories high and containing 48 rooms for student's, a chape, a library and 3 other public rooms; a President's house and a steward's establishment—all of brick, and 2 other houses for Professors. Annual expenses— for tuition, board, room rent, washing, $150. Commencement is on the 4th Wednesday in September. Vacations— 1st the month of October; 2d the month of May. The Union Theological Seminary is located in Prince Edward Co. in the vicinity of the C. H. and near Hampden Sydney College. The Institution had its origin in efforts made by the presbytery of Hanover, and the Synod of Virginia, as early as 1812, to give to their candidates for the ministry a more complete theological education. It did not however go into operation in a regular form until the year 1824. The Seminary is under the controul of a board of 24 directors chosen once in 4 years by the Synods of Virginia and North Carolina. Its funds are derived from the free contribution of Presbyterians in various parts of the country, and amount to nearly enough to provide for the support of 3 Professors. Its buildings are of brick and consist of 2 Professor's dwellings, and a central edifice, 196 ft. long and 4 stories high, containing a chapel, library, lecture rooms, museum, depository, dining hall, rooms for 100 students, and for the family of a steward. The library is small, containing only 3,000 vols. but is highly valuable from the care employed in its selection. Its officers are the Professors of the Institution, namely, those of Christian Theology, of Ecclesiastical History and Polity, of Oriental Literature and such others as may be chosen. These constitute a faculty for internal government, of which the Professor of Christian Theology is ex-officio chairman. Its students are only those who design to become ministers of the gospel. Any such person can become a member of the Institution, who is a member of any Christian church, who sustains before the faculty a satisfactory examination on personal experience of religion, who has graduated at some reputable College, or gained in some other way a liberal education. The course of study in the Institution embraces the Hebrew and Chaldee languages, Jewish Archiology, Sacred Geography, Biblical Criticism, Biblical Literature, Biblical Interpretation, Theory and Practice, Biblical History, Ecclesiastical History and Polity, Church Government, Natural Theology, Evidences of Revelation, Canon Christian Theology, Confession of Faith, Pastoral Theology, and the Composition and Delivery of Sermons. Since 1824, 127 students have belonged to the Institution, and its chairs have been filled as follows:— Theology—John H. Rice, D. D. inaugurated 1824,—died 1831. Oriental Lit—Hiram P. Goodrich, inaugurated 1828. Theology—George A. Baxter, inaug. 1832. Church History—Vacant. Assistant—Elisha Ballantine. The people of this county are generally intelligent and well informed. The Presbyterian denomination are more numerous than in any other Co. in the state. Population in 1820, 12,587—in 1830, 14,109, or 55 to the sq. m. giving an increase of 1,530 in 10 yrs; of the last amount there were whites, 5,514, and 8,593 blacks, giving an increase of 3,079 over the free population: many of which are free blacks and mulattoes. The free negroes in this county are more numerous than in any other county in the state. Prince Edward belongs to the 9th judicial circuit, and fifth district. Tax paid in 1833, $3,844 73—in 1834, on lots, $118 28—land, 1,751 76—4831 slaves, $1,207 75—2,685 horses, $161 10—6 studs, $102 00—122 coaches, $336 60—44 carryalls, $49 40—144 gigs, $88 00. Total, $3,814 89. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $126 45—in 1833, $207 33. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Burkesville, P. O. in the southern part of the county, 66 ms. S. W. by W. of R. and 188 from W. Carter's Store, P. O. in the S. W. part of the county, 81 ms. S. W. by W. of R. and 172 ms. from W. Farmville, P. V. 68 ms. S. W. by W. of R. and 159 from W., situated on the N. border of the county, near the head of batteaux navigation, and on the S. side of Appomattox river. This village was incorporated in 1832, with 7 trustees, having power to tax, &amp;c. It contains 2 tobacco warehouses, at which are inspected annually from 4,000 to 4,500 hogsheads; this inspection affords a larger proportion of fine French tobacco, than any other in the state. There are 5 tobacco factories, giving employment to 250 hands, 10 mercantile stores, 2 houses of public worship, (1 Presbyterian and 1 Methodist,) 2 taverns, 1 printing office, 1 female school, 1 cabinet maker, 2 smith shops, 1 tailor, 1 wheelwright, 1 boot and shoe factory, 1 saddler, 1 tan yard, 2 confectioners, and 2 milliners and mantua makers. The navigation of the river from this place to Petersburg is good at all seasons of the year, and gives employment to about 40 batteaux, with 3 men in each, carrying from 5 to 7 tons. Farmville is growing in importance and trade. It is at the present time one of the finest towns in proportion to its size and commerce in Virginia. Population 800 persons; of whom 2 are physicians. Hermitage, P. O. 91 ms. S. W. by W. of R. and 182 ms. from W. situated in the western part of the Co. on a considerable eminence which commands a beautiful view, at the intersection of the roads leading from Charlottesville, to the S. and from Petersburg to Lynchburg. It has Vaughan's creek on the S., and a mill creek on the N. side. It contains several dwelling houses, and 1 mercantile store, &amp;c. The lands in the neighborhood, are of a light, gray, sandy soil, producing wheat, corn, oats and tobacco tolerable well. Jamestown, P. V. 60 ms. S. W. by W. of R. and 167 from W., situated in the N. E. angle of the county on the S. side of Appomattox river, 8 ms. below Farmville, 3 ms. below the dividing line of Prince Edward and Amelia, and 60 ms. from Petersburg and Lynchburg. This village was laid off in 1796 into 8 squares, each containing 4½ acre lots. The mercantile business of this place was at one time very flourishing; the inspection of tobacco was carried on to a limited extent for several years, but has been discontinued; since which time the village has ceased to flourish. It contains at this time, several dwelling houses, 1 house of public worship, free for all denominations, 2 miscellaneous stores, and 1 house of entertainment. The surrounding country, is healthy,—the land much broken, and the soil peculiarly adapted to the growth of fine tobacco, which with wheat constitutes the staple. Marble Hill, P. O. 83 ms. S. W. by W. of R. and 174 ms. from W. Merriman's Shop, P. O. 94 ms. from R. and 185 ms. from W. Moor's Ordinary, 90 ms. S. W. by W. of R. and 181 ms. from W. PRINCE EDWARD C. H. P. V. 75 ms. S. W. by W. of R. and 166 ms. from W. This village contains 21 dwelling houses, besides the usual county buildings, and about the same number of public and private offices; a large and handsome Presbyterian church built of brick, beautifully situated about a quarter of a mile from the village, 1 tanyard, 1 coach manufactory, and various other mechanics. There are 2 flourishing academies; the female seminary, deserves the high reputation which it enjoys,— The present number of pupils is about 80. The course of studies, requires 3 years to complete it; in addition to the instruction afforded by the 2 principals and their 5 assistants, the pupils have the advantage of instruction in science, and the languages from the Professors of Hampden Sydney College,—the other institution alluded to is for males, and prepares pupils to enter the Colleges with credit the annual number is between 40 and 50. County Courts are held on the 3rd Monday in every month;—Quarterly ly in March, May, August and November. Judge Leigh holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 26th of April and September. Prospect, P. O. 80 ms. S. S. W. of R. and 171 ms. from W. Sandy River Church, P. O. in the S. E. part of the county, 79 ms. S. W. by W. of R. and 170 ms. from W. This place takes its name from a small tributary of the Appomattox. It was built in the year 1768 by the church of England. Since the revolution, it has been kept up by the citizens of the neighborhood of all denominations. In the immediate vicinity of the church, there is a house of entertainment, a mercantile store, several mechanics, and 1 physician. The land of the surrounding country is generally good; the principal product is tobacco, and the neighborhood is wealthy. Walker's Church, P. O. in the southern part of the county, 88 ms. S. W. by W. of R. and 177 from W. PRINCE GEORGE. Prince George was created by the Legislature in 1702, and formed from a part of Charles City Co. It is bounded on the N. by the Appomattox which separates it from Chesterfield, and James river which separates it from Charles City,—E. by Surry,—S. by Sussex,—and W. by Dinwiddie. Its length from E. to W. is 21 ms. breadth 12, and area 312 sq. miles. It extends in lat from 37° to 37° 15′ N. and in long from 0° 5′ E. of W. C. to 0° 25′ W. of W. C. Very little of this county slopes towards its border near the Appomattox and James, by far the greater portion slopes S. E. towards Blackwater river, the sources of which lie in this county, Population in 1820, 8,030—in 1830, 8,367. This county belongs to the 2nd judicial circuit, and 1st district. Tax paid in 1833, $1,868 85— in 1834, on lots, $80 79—on land, $916 53—2,478 slaves, $619 50— 1,177 horses. $70 74—3 studs, $46 00—49 coaches, $133 80—20 carry, alls, $20 00—96 gigs, $54 15—Total, $1,941 49. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $137 80—in 1833, $205 16. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. CITY POINT, Port and Post Village, on the right shore of James river, at the junction of the James and Appomattox, in the N. W. part of the county, 12 ms. below Petersburg, 34 ms. S. E. of R. and 156 ms. from W. City Point of itself, is a very inconsiderable village, being a place of no trade, except in a small retail way. It is however a considerable port, as an appendage of the towns of Petersburg and Richmond. At City Point there are 4 or 5 wharves, projecting a short distance into the river, within 30 yards of which is a sufficient depth of water to swim the largest ship that ever floated. "Not only is a large foreign shipping business done here, but the white sails of domestic commerce, daily gladden the eye, as it passes and repasses this port, freighted in its progress upwards with the wealth and productions, and exports of every clime, while its return carries to every port of our happy Union, the produce of our soil and of our mines." Exclusive of the ordinary shipping, there are steam, freight, tow and passage boats, which make this a stopping place in their passage up and down the river. In short City Point, though small in itself is a considerable out port to the City of Richmond, and the town of Petersburg, and when the Petersburg Rail road, and the James and Kanawha improvement shall be in full operation, it is more than probable that this little village, will present an appearance that will reflect credit, on the enterprize of Virginia capitalists and insure to the Old Dominion that commercial importance to which she is so justly entitled, and which will be so beneficial to every class of the community; but more especially to the farmers, whose products, will meet a ready sale, at such prices, as cannot fail to reward their industry. City Point, contains about 25 houses, 3 taverns, 3 groceries, a school and hospital. Prince George is famed for the manufacture of her hollow ware, i. e. flour barrels, &amp;c., her marshes for soras and wild ducks, &amp;c. and her rivers, creeks and mill ponds for fine chub, perch, sturgeon, rock fish, shad, &amp;c. Population between 90 and 100 persons; of whom 1 is a physician. PRINCE GEORGE C. H. is situated near the centre of the county. County Courts are held on the 2d Tuesday in every month:—Quarterly in March, May, August and November. Judge May, holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 25th of May and October. Templeton, P. O. 36 ms. S. W. of R. and 158 ms. from W., situated immediately, on the post road, which leads from Petersburg, to Jerusalem, in Southampton Co. 15 ms. from the former, and 35 ms. from the latter. There is an ordinary kept here which has been in existence for 30 years. The situation is high and salubrious, remote from any water course, or marshy land. PRINCESS ANNE. Princess Anne was created by the legislature in 1691, and formed from a portion of lower Norfolk county. It is bounded on the N. by the Chesapeak, E. by the Atlantic, S. by Currituck Co. N. Carolina, and W. by Norfolk county. Its length from S. to N. is 30 ms.; mean breadth 12, and area 360 square miles. The parallel of N. lat. 36° 45′ and long 1° E. o W. C. intersect near the centre of the county. The northern part of this county, slopes N. and pours its waters into Lyn Haven bay,—the western part, into the eastern branch of Elizabeth river,—the southern part into Back Bay, and Currituck Sound. Population in 1810, 9,498,—1820, 8,730—in 1830, 9,102. This county belongs to the first judicial circuit and first district. Tax paid in 1833, $1846 85—in 1834 on lots, $16 63—on land, $1115 45—1744 slaves, $436 00—1757 horses, $105 42—6 studs, $83 00—17 coaches, $38 25— 16 carryalls, $17 25—154 gigs, $95 50. Total, $1907 50. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $267 94—in 1833, $115 63. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Kempsville, P. V. 10 ms. S. E. by E. of Norfolk, 124 from R. and 227 from W. situated on the eastern branch of Elizabeth river, at the head of tide water. It contains 27 dwelling houses, 1 miscellaneous store, and several groceries, 1 Baptist house of worship, and 1 common school. The mechanics are a tanner and currier, several carpenters, wheelwrights, blacksmiths, &amp;c. Large quantities of lumber are sent in rafts and lighters, from this place to Norfolk; also much navy-timber, staves, wood, &amp;c. Population 200 persons; of whom 3 are physicians. London Bridge, P. O. in the northeastern part of the county, 15 ms. N. E. of Norfolk, 8 S. W. of Cape Henry, 130 from R. and 233 from W. PRINCESS ANNE C. H. P. V. 137 ms. from R. and 240 from W. in lat. 36° 44, N. and long 0° 57′ E. of W. C. It contains, besides the usual county buildings, 17 dwelling houses, 2 Methodist houses of public worship, 2 elementary schools, 1 miscellaneous store, several carpenters, and various other mechanics. The principal pursuit of the inhabitants is farming. Population 150 persons; of whom 1 is an attorney, and 2 are physicians. County Courts are held on the 1st Monday in every month. Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Baker holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 25th May and 22d September. PRINCE WILLIAM. Prince William was established by the Legislature in 1730, and formed from a portion of Stafford and King George counties. It is bounded N. and N. E. by Bull Run, and Occoquan river, which separate it from Loudoun and Fairfax,—E. by the Potomac, separating it from Charles county Maryland,—S. by Stafford,—S. W. and W. by Fauquier. Its mean length is 30¾ miles, mean breadth 12, and its area, 370 square miles. It extends in lat from 38° 30′ to 38° 55′ N. and in long. from 0° 15′ to 0° 45′ W. of W. C. Occoquan river rises in Loudoun, Fairfax, and Fauquier counties,— traverses and drains the upper part of Prince William. It is an important tributary of the Potomac, and falls into that river 25 ms. below W. C. and nearly opposite to Indian Point. Its principal branches are Bull Run, Broad Run and Cedar Run. Bull Run from its source to its mouth, is the dividing line between the counties of Fairfax and Prince William. It joins the Occoquan about 7 miles above the town of Occoquan, and 14 miles from the Potomac river. Broad Run has its source in Fauquier county, and after passing through the chain of the Bull Run mountain, at the pass of Thoroughfare, and by the town of Buckland, joins the Cedar Run about a mile below Brentsville, the county town of Prince William Cedar Run rises in Fauquier county, and passing near Warrenton, joins Broad Run near Brentsville. These streams, and indeed many of their branches, afford fine seats for manufacturing establishments. At the junction of Broad and Cedar, the river receives the name of Occoquan. Its general direction towards the Potomac is S. E.—and its length about 25 ms. At 18 ms. from the junction it meets the tides at the town of Occoquan. Here it reaches the hills, which are the boundary of the Potomac valley, and down them the river is precipitated about 72 feet, in the distance of one and a half miles. In these hills is the chain of rocks which crosses all the rivers of Lower Virginia at the head of tide water. The action of the water in the course of ages, has washed the earth from the channel, and the rocks lie in its bed in every rude variety of position. The banks of the river here present every where jutting rocks, and sometimes great precipices. The pine finds sustenance among the crevices and gives a relief and a grace to scenery that would otherwise be savage. Immediately below the town of Occoquan the banks subside into a plain; and at two miles, the ancient town of Colchester is passed. Five miles below Colchester a junction is effected with the Potomac, between High and Freestone Points. At its mouth the Occoquan is five miles wide; at the head of the tide, it is about 75 yards; here however it is hemmed in by the hills, and as the volume of its waters is very great, in floods it is very deep, (viz. from 12 to 20 feet.). Below the town of Colchester it suddenly widens to two or three miles. The earth and rubbish brought down by the floods are deposited, and at such times the navigation is obstructed for vessels drawing more than 5 feet water. There is however nothing which opposes serious obstacles to clearing the bar, whenever the wants of the people inhabiting the country drained by its waters shall require it. The subject has already attracted some attention, and the navigation of the river and its important branch Cedar run, which it has been proposed to effect, above the tide by the lock and dam system, has been the occasion of some proceedings in the legislature. Population in 1810, 11,311—1820, 9,419—1830, 9,320. Prince William belongs to the sixth judicial circuit and third district. Tax paid in 1833, $2697 07—in 1834 on lots, $183 15—on land, 1772 65—1737 slaves, $434 25—2383 horses, $142 98—5 studs, $48 00—27 coaches, $59 50—15 carryalls, $15 00—16 gigs, $12 95. Total, $2668 48, Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $500 18—in 1833, $565 32 TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. BRENTSVILLE, P. V. and seat of justice, 104 ms. from R. and 48 S. W. of W.—The Court House, clerk's office and jail are handsomely situated on the main street, in a public square of three acres. Besides them, the village contains 19 dwelling houses, 3 miscellaneous stores 2 handsome taverns, built of brick and stuccoed, 1 house of entertainment, 1 house of public worship, free for all denominations,—a bible society, a sunday school, a temperance and a tract society, which have been of considerable utility for the last 5 or 6 years. There is in the vicinity a common school in which the rudiments of English education are taught Brentsville is of recent establishment, having been located around the site of the new court house in 1822, at which time it was completed, and the courts removed from Dumfries. It has progressed with its improvements perhaps more rapidly than has been observable with other county towns within the same period after their establishment, though it may be considered nearly stationary for the present. The wasteful tenure of the Bristoe estate, the property of the commonwealth, in the midst of which it is located, has in a manner cut it off from the benefits of a thriving neighborhood. This tract, containing near 7000 acres and naturally the best land in this section, has been ravaged of all its timber, and for the most part "ploughed down to be barren," by an unmerciful course of cultivation, under a numerous tenantry, for upwards of 70 years. Most of the lost around the place have become freed from their lease, by the direliction of the tenants, who have left them an immense common: but by an act of Assembly of 1833-4, authorising the sale of this estate on such terms as the president and directors of the Literary Fund may direct, there is no doubt but the desert will soon be made to blossom under the labors of individual enterprise, and Brentsville will take a new start towards prosperity. Situated at the head of Occoquan river, which could easily be made navigable for boats at a cheap rate, and laying near two large runs, (Broad and Cedar) which here from the Occoquan. Brentsville is 14 miles from Dumfries, 18 from Occoquan mills, and equidistant 33 ms. from Fredericksburg and Alexandria, 12 from Hay Market, and 20 from Warrenton. It is within 9 or 10 ms. of the Warrenton and Alexandria turnpike. Population 130 persons, of whom 3 are attorneys and 3 regular physicians. The place is healthy and has a beautiful prospect of the Bull Run and Watery range of mountains, and the more distant Blue Ridge. County Courts are held on the 1st Monday, in every month.—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Scott holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 1st of May, and October. Buckland, P. V. in the northwestern part of the county, 5 ms. S. W. of Hay Market, 116 from R. and 42 from W. This village has an elevated and romantic situation on Broad Run, a never failing stream, on which two extensive flour manufacturing mills are situated,—the one in the town and the other on its edge. A turnpike runs through the village which extends 35 ms. below to Alexdria, and 8 ms. above to Warrenton. This village and its suburbs contains 22 dwelling houses, 1 general store, 1 large and extensive distillery, 1 apothecary shop, 1 house of public worship free for all denominations, and 2 houses of entertainment. The mechanics are, 1 tanner and currier, 1 wagon maker, 1 boot and shoe manufacturer, 1 cooper, 1 hatter, 1 millwright, 1 blacksmith, 1 tailor and saddler. Buckland is an incorporated town, and for beauty of situation and circumjacent scenery is perhaps not to be surpassed by any other in the county. There is one well organized sunday school, and 1 common school. Population 130 whites; of whom 1 is a physician; and 50 blacks. Dumfries, P. V. 33 ms. S. S. W. of W. and 89 from R., situated on Quantico creek, near the Potomac river. It contains 80 dwelling houses, 3 mercantile stores, a Baptist and a Methodist house of worship, 1 school house, 2 taverns, 1 manufacturing flour mill, 1 woollen manufactory, 1 temperance society, a tanyard, 2 saddlers, 5 house carpenters, and 2 blacksmith shops. During the freeze in the winter when the steam boat between the city of Washington and Potomac creek is obstructed by ice, the great northern and southern mail from W. C. to New Orleans, is carried through this town. The road in its neighborhood between Fredericksburg and Alexandria, is in a worse condition than perhaps any in the middle States, so utterly impassable at times that the mail cannot travel. This road being the principal source of the irregularities of the mail at the south, a canal was undertaken, and about three-eights of a mile completed, but the whole scheme failed for the want of the proper direction of the funds. The mouth of Quantico, 2½ miles from Dumfries, is the best winter harbor on the Potomac. The river seldom freezes lower than that point. Dumfries is one of the oldest towns in the United States, and once could boast of much commerce, but owing to a variety of circumstances, like many old settlements, it is now in a great measure abandoned, and many of its excellent dwellings are in a state of rapid decay. Population 500 persons; of whom 1 is an attorney and 2 are regular physicians. Hay Market, P. O. situated in the northern part of the county on the head of Occoquan creek, 120 ms. from R. and 43 from W. Liberia, P. V. 112 ms. from R. and 33 S. W. of W. C. It contains a store, ware house and blacksmith shop, and a little distance from these under the same name, 7 other buildings. This place was established in 1825, and the post-office in 1829. It is 7 ms. distant from Brentsville, in a N. E. direction. A mail goes once a week from this place to Centreville 5 ms. N. of it, at which place it intersects the S. W. mail from W. C. The trade of the place is in dry goods and groceries, and the purchase of country produce. The country around is thickly settled, and the inhabitants are distinguished for their moral deportment. The land of the surrounding country was of universally good quality, but has been much abused by a system of miserable cultivation; it is yet susceptible of a high degree of improvement, by the use of clover and gypsum, of which many farmers have commenced the use. Occoquan, P. V. 23 ms. S. W. of W. and 99 from R., situated in the N. E. part of the county on the south side of Occoquan river. It was established by act of Assembly in the year 1804. The site on which this town is situated is extremely rugged and ill-suited for building. The town is regularly laid out, the streets generally cross each other at right angles. It contains about 50 dwelling houses, several mercantile stores, and various mechanics,—a cotton manufactory in complete operation, and one of the first established in the State, now running 1000 spindles, 1 extensive manufacturing flour mill, grinding in the ordinary season 150 barrels per day,—with the necessary appendages of grist, saw, and plaster mills. A handsome and permanent bridge is erected across the river at this place; over the bridge and thro' the town runs the great mail route from Washington to the south. This village is in a flourishing condition, and with confidence looks forward to further improvement. The principal trade of the town is with the counties of Fairfax, Loudoun, Fauquier, and Stafford. The Occoquan at this place has a fall of 72 feet in 1½ ms. affording excellent sites for manufactories. This is the market for many of the most important shad and herring fisheries on the Potomac. The scenery at and near Occoquan has frequently been the theme of praise. The traveller moving along the plains of lower Virginia, his eye accustomed to the tame prospect of the alluvial country, suddenly finds himself in a ravine, descending a hill, the precipitous ridges of which inspire him with terror. Should curiosity prompt him to tarry the rest of the day amidst this wild scene, the sacrifice will be amply repaid.—The botany of this neighborhood is very rich; here are in close proximity plants of the mountain and of the marshes. The mosses are numerous and beautiful. In the marshes, near the mouth of the river, are many interesting plants. In the river in this vicinity there is a quarry of valuable whetstones, a bank impregnated with alum, and a cave which has never been satisfactorily explored. Thoroughfare, P. V. 47 ms. S. W. of W. and 124 from R., situated near the western boundary of the county, 9 ms. N. E. of Warrenton; with a turnpike to Alexandria 36 ms. distant. It lies immediately under the Bull Run mountain, which runs N. and S. and takes its name from a small stream which passes through it. About 3 miles N. of this place Broad Run, one of the best streams in this section of country for size and constancy, passes through the same mountain. Upon this stream there are 2 manufacturing flour mills, running 3 pair of buhra, and which jointly manufacture from 20 to 30,000 bushels of wheat annually; the water of these mills has a fall of from 22 to 24 feet in the distance of half a mile. About 600 yards below the Thoroughfare, there is an advantageous position for a manufactory, with a fall of water of 22 feet. At this place are located 12 dwelling houses, and 1 mercantile store. Baoad Run is composed of two streams which unite a short distance above the mountain, each having pursued their respective courses through a rich and mountainous region for many miles; at the base of the mountain they unite, and rush together with great velocity over a rocky bed bearing a striking resemblance to the scene presented by the mountains, rivers, &amp;c., at Harper's Ferry, on a smaller scale. The land lying immediately above the mountains is rich, and contains a dense population, bearing a strong evidence that it was once inundated, from a like cause as at Harper's Ferry. The western side of the mountain presents an abrupt precipice of granite rock, while the trees grow to the summit. On the east in the gap of the mountain, the rocks lie scatterred in wild confusion, evidently thrown out by some great concussion of nature. Near the gap is a spring issuing from under a great rock, of the purest and best water, which is not increased or diminished in any season. It stands on the road side, and is by travellers regarded as the "Diamond Spring, in Palestine." There are some indications of coal and iron, but neither has as yet been discovered. The mountains on the east side present a most romantic and beautiful view of the rapid and roaring current winding its way through a fertile valley. RAPPAHANNOCK. Rappahannock was created by the Legislature in 1831, and formed out of a portion of Culpeper county. It is bounded on the N. by the North Fork of the Rappahannock river, which separates it from Fauquier,—E. by Culpeper,—S. by Madison,—and W. by the Blue Ridge, which separates it from Shenandoah. It extends in lat from about 38° 3′ to 38° 22′ N. and in long. from about 0° 5′ to 1° 15′ W. of W. C. Its precise dimensions in miles, we are unacquainted with. Its population also, being included with that of Culpeper at the last census, is unknown. Rappahannock belongs to the 11th judicial circuit and 6th district. Tax paid in 1833, $1851 06—in 1834, on lots, $46 72—on land, $1096 83— 1858 slaves, $464 50—2743 horses, $164 58—10 studs, $81 00—13 coaches, $33 00—6 carryalls, $6 00—9 gigs, $5 50. Total, $1898 13.

Population 200 persons; of whom 1 is an attorney, and 2 are regular physicians. RICHMOND. Richmond was created by the Legislature in 1692, when the old county of Rappahannock was extinguished and the counties of Essex and Richmond made from its territories. It is bounded N. and N. E. by Westmoreland,—E. by Northumberland,—S. by Moratico creek, which separates it from Lancaster,—S. W. and W. by the Rappahannock river, which separates it from Essex,—and N. W. by Brockenbrough creek, separating it from Westmoreland. Its mean length is 25 miles, breadth 7¾, and area 194 sq. miles. It extends in lat. from 37° 47′ to 38° 10′ N. and in long. from 0° 10′ to 0° 30′ E. of W. C. Richmond belongs to the fifth judicial circuit, and third district. Population in 1820, 5,706—in 1830, 6,055.

Population 100 persons; of whom 4 are attorneys, and 1 a physician. County Courts are held on the 1st Monday in every month. Quarterly in March, May, August and November. Judge Lomax holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 12th of April and 8th of October. SOUTHAMPTON. Southampton was created by act of Assembly in 1748, and formed out of a part of Isle of Wight county. It is bounded N. W. by Sussex,— Surry N.—Blackwater river, separating it from the Isle of Wight, N. E. —Nansemond E.,—Hertford and Northampton counties, N. Carolina, S. —and Meherrin river, separating it from Greensville, S. W. Its length is 40 miles, mean width 15; and area 600 square miles. The parallel of N. lat. 36° 40′, and the meridian of W. C. intersect in this county. Its slope is southeastward, and in that direction it is traversed by Nottoway river. The soil of this county is light and but little broken and well adapted to the cultivation of Indian corn, cotton, beans and potatoes, of which the two first are the principal commodities. The husbandry is generally good. —It abounds in the finest of pine timber, from which is made for exportation tar and turpentine. Nottoway river runs from N. W. to S. E., and by its junction with the Black water river forms the Chowan. It is navigable for vessels of 60 or 70 tons, as far as Monroe, from which place considerable quantities of lumber and other produce are shipped to Norfolk. Its length is about 120 miles.—Blackwater river takes its rise in Prince George county, and running in a southwardly direction, unites with the Nottoway. It is navigable for vessels of the largest size as far as South Quay in Nansemond county, and for small vessels for some miles higher up into the county of Southampton. In the low grounds bordering upon Nottoway and Blackwater rivers, the growth is chiefly oak and cypress of the finest quality, which must at no distant period be of great value.—The Portsmouth and Roanoke rail road passing through the county, and consequently crossing each of these rivers, will afford the greatest facility in conveying produce to market.—The prevailing religious denominations in this county are the Methodist and Baptist. They each have numerous houses of public worship in convenient parts of the county. Population in 1820, 14,170—in 1830, 16,074. Southampton belongs to the first judicial circuit and first district. Tax paid in 1833, $3136 33— in 1834.—On lots, $31 28—on land, $1470 03—3835 slaves, $958 75— 2661 horses, $159 66—14 studs, $166 00—51 coaches, $125 00—24 carryalls, $24 00—277 gigs, $161 55. Total, $3096 28. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $515 45—in 1833, $507 81. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Bethlehem Cross Roads, P. O. 91 ms. from R. and 213 from W. Bowers', P.

County Courts are held on the 3d Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Baker holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 1st of June and 29th of October. Urquhart's Store, P. O. 79 ms. S. E. of R. and 201 from W. SPOTTSYLVANIA. Spottsylvania, was created by the legislature in 1720, and formed out of portions of Essex, King William and King &amp; Queen counties. It is bounded on the N. by the Rappahannock river which separates it from Culpeper and Stafford, on the E. by Caroline, on the S. by Caroline, Hanover and Louisa, and on the W. by Orange. It is situated between 37° 59′ and 38° 20′ N. and between 20° 30′ and 57° 30′ W. from W. This county contains exclusive of Fredericksburg, 11,826 inhabitants. The soil of Spottsylvania is various, that near the rivers and smaller streams is very fine; but it is far otherwise on the ridges; for a wretched system of cultivation adopted by the first settlers and long persisted in by their descendants, has reduced the land, originally thin, to a condition from which it will require much time and labor to rescue it. The gold mines of this county having excited some interest, it may not be out of place here to say something of them. About seven years ago two brothers of the name of White, discovered some small pieces of gold on their farm, this naturally excited them to look further; when it was discovered that after every rain numerous particles of various sizes became visible. This was a sufficient hint to others. The most energetic, but misdirected zeal covered the country with explorers, having the least possible knowledge of the matter in hand. They might be seen hurrying hither and thither with a spade and tin pan, now stooping to lift a stone—now stooping to wound the bosom of their mother earth, and perhaps add another pound to the already cumbrous load of "indications" at their back. It was marvellous to see how they mutilated and distorted terms of science. The classic heathen were not more familiar with their household gods, than were these children of mamon with what they were pleased to call "fridiginous quartz and "oxinginized iron." A little cube of sulphuret of iron found on a man's farm, would elevate his hopes to the highest pitch of excitement; and if any one told him that it was not gold, he incontinently suspected him of a design to purchase the land. Gold, however, was found in considerable quantities, and that sort of stock rose to an excessive price, which of necessity produced a correspondent reaction, and the present depression is probably as much below the real value, as the former was above it.* * There are two manners of gathering gold practised here—1st by washing the earth for what is called "surface-gold." This plan is pursued in several places in the county. The earth containing the particles, is thrown into cradles, into which mercury is poured, and a constant stream of water is directed—the amalgum found in the bottom is distilled—2nd mining, properly so called, is also carried on at a place on the Rappahannock river about 20 miles above Fredericksburg, the property of the United States Mining Company, incorporated at the last session of the legislature. Tobacco was formerly planted to the exclusion of almost every thing else; but within the last 30 years it has gradually given place to wheat and Indian corn. The minerals found in greatest abundance are granite, free stone quartz and shistus: the two latter being ordinarily the gangue of the gold. The religious sects in the county are exclusive of the town, chiefly Baptists, who have 8 meeting houses; and Methodists who have 4 meeting houses. Of stores there are 7; mills 25, some of which are prepared for making flour, but only 1 is thus employed, and taverns 5. In these last are included only those which have tavern licence. The natural growth of the county is principally oak, and what is here called fox-tail pine, the latter being found in lands which were formerly exhausted by injudicious cultivation, and being neglected have thus clothed themselves. Population 1820, 14,254—1830, 15,134. This county belongs to the 5th judicial circuit and 3rd district. Taxes paid in 1833, $4,064 10—in 1834, on lots, $959 24—on land, $1,534 89—4,250 slaves, $1,062 50—2,478 horses, $148 68—10 studs, $98 00—78 coaches, $174 00—4 stages, $7 00—39 carrayalls, $39 00—131 gigs, $80 27. Total, $4,103 58. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $402 39—in 1833, $507 23. Historical Sketch—The earliest authentic information we have of that portion of our state now called. Spottsylvania, is found in an act past "at a grand assemblie held at James Cittie" between the 20th September 1674, and the 17th March 1675, in which war is declared against the Indians; and amongst other provisions for carring it on, it is ordered that "one hundred and eleven men out of Glocester county be garrisoned at one "ffort," or place of defence at or neare the ffalls of Rapahanack river, of which ffort Major Lawrence Smith to be captain or chiefe commander;" and that this "ffort" be furnished with "ffour hundred and eighty pounds of powder, ffourteen hundred and fforty three pounds of shott." This "ffort" was built in 1676 as appears by the preamble of a subsequent act. In the year 1679 Major Lawrence Smith upon his own suggestion was empowered, provided he would settle or seate downe at or neare said fort by the last day of March 1681, and have in readiness upon all occasions on beat of drum, fifty able men well armed with sufficient ammunitions, &amp;c. and two hundred men more within the space of a mile along the river; and a quarter of a mile back from the river, prepared always to march twenty miles in any direction from the fort; or should they be obliged to go more than such distance to be paid for their time thus employed at the rate of other "souldiers," "to execute martiall discipline" amongst the said fifty "souldiers and others so put in arms" both in times of war and peace and 36 said Smith with two others of said privileged place to hear and determine all causes civil and criminal, that may arise within said limits, as a county Court might do, and to make bye-laws for the same. These military settlers were priviledged from arrest for any debts save those due to the King, and those contracted among themselves—and were free from taxes and levies save those laid within their own limits. The exact situation of this fort cannot now be determined with absolute certainty; but as it is known that there was once a military post at Germana, some ruins of which are still occasionally turned up by the plough, it is probable that this is the spot selected by Col. Smith for his colony. The earliest notice we have of Spottsylvania county, as such, is found in 7th Geo. I. 1720, passed at Williamsburg, of which the preamble declares by way of inducement "that the frontiers toward the high mountains are exposed to danger from the Indians and the late settlements of the French to the westward of the said mountains." Therefore it is enacted that Spottsylvania county bounds upon Snow creek up to the mill, thence by a S. W. line to the North Anna, thence up the said river as far as convenient, and thence by a line to be run over the high mountains to the river on the N. W. side thereof, so as to include the northern passage through the said mountains, thence down the said river until it comes against the head of Rappahannock, thence by a line to the head of Rappahannock river and down that river to the mouth of Snow creek, which tract of lands from the 1st of May 1721 shall become a county by the name of Spottsylvania Co." The act goes on to direct that "fifteen hundred pounds current money of Virginia shall be paid by the treasurer to the Governor, for these uses, to wit: £500 to be expended in a church, court house, prison, pillory and stocks in said county: £1,000 to be laid out in arms, ammunition, &amp;c. of which each "Christian tytheable" is to have "one firelock, musket,* * Whether it was intended to make these a compound word as firelock-musket, we know not—we have followed the printed act. one socket, bayonet fired thereto, one cartouch box, eight pounds bullet, and two pounds powder." The inhabitants were made free of public levies for ten years, and the whole county made one parish by the name of St. George. From the following clause of the same act it is presumed that this new county had been cut off from Essex, King &amp; Queen and King Williams for the act declares that "until the Governor shall settle a court in Spottsylvania," the justices of these counties "shall take power over them by their warrants, and the clerks of said courts by their process returnable to their said courts, in the same manner as before the said county was constituted.," &amp;c. In the year 1730 an act was passed directing that the Burgesses for this county should be allowed for four days journey in passing to Williamsburg; and the same returning. In the same year St. George's Parish was divided by a line running from the mouth of Rappahannock to the Pamunkey, the upper portion to be called St. Mark's Parish; the lower part to retain the name of St. George's Parish. Four years after this the county was thus divided: St. George's Parish to be still called Spottsylvania; and St. Mark's Parish to be called Orange, and all settlers beyond the "Sherrando,"† † This is the spelling of the act "Sherrando." river to be exempt for three years from the "paiment" of public and parish dues. The Governor fixed the seat of justice at Germanna, where the first court sat on the 1st day of August 1722 when Augustine Smith, Richard Booker, John Taliaferro, Wm. Hunsford, Richard Johnson and Wm. Bledsoe were sworn as justices, John Waller, as clerk, and Wm. Bledsoe as sheriff, this place being found "inconvenient to the people," it was directed by law that from and after the 1st August 1732, the court should be held at Fredericksburg, which law was repealed seventeen years afterwards, because it was "derogatory to his majesty's prerogative to take from the Governor or come mander-in-chief of this colony his power and authority of removing or adjourning the courts;" and because "it might be inconvenient in a case of small pox or other contagious distemper." In 1769 the county which had theretofore been one parish was thus divided,—all that part lying between the rivers Rappahannock and Po retained the name of St. George's Parish,—the rest of the county was erected into a new parish called Berkley. In 1778 an act was passed authorising the justices to build a Court house at some point near the centre of the county to which the courts hould be removed, provided a majority of the justices should concur in deeming it advisable. It appears that the justices determined to avail themselves of this privilege, for an act of 1780 passed, as is therein stated in consequence of a representation, that the Court house in Fredericksburg was "unfit to hold courts in," authorises the county court to be held at the house of John Holladay, "until the new Court house now building in the said county shall be completed." The first regular stage coaches that passed through this county were established by Nathaniel Twining, by virture of an exclusive privilege granted him in 1784, for the term of three years, to be paid at the rate of five pence per mile by each passenger. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Chancellorsville, P. V. 76 ms. from R. and 66 from W., situated at the junction of Elly's road with the Swift Run Gap and Fredericksburg turnpike, about 10 ms. from the latter place. It contains 14 dwelling houses, a tavern which has a front of 106 ft. on the turnpike and runs back 55 ft. on Elly's road, and a blacksmith shop. The surrounding scenery is very pretty, and the soil tolerably fertile and susceptible of improvement. The products are corn, wheat, rye, oats and hay, which are principally sold in Fredericksburg. The neighborhood is thickly settled, and contain 3 houses of public worship, 2 of which belong to the Baptist, and 1 to the Methodists, and a Sunday school in a prosperous condition. Danielsville, P. O. 90 ms. from R. and 80 ms. S. W. of W. Daniels ville is only a P. O. situated in the midst of the gold region, and contiguous to the White Hall gold mine, 10 ms. S. W. of Fredericksburg, 24 ms. E. of Orange C. H., 8 ms. S. of the Wildnerness tavern, 12 ms. E. of the Orange Springs, and 10 ms. W. of Spottsylvania C. H. immediately on the road leading from Orange Springs to Fredericksburg. The mail is carried on horseback, and received on Wednesday's and Thursday's. Fredericksburg, Port of Entry, P. T. and county seat, 56 ms. S. S. W. of Washington City, and 66 ms. a little E. of N. from Richmond, in lat. 38° 34′, 20″ N. and long. 77° 38′ W. of W. C., situated on the S. side of Rappahannock river, at the head of tide water, and about 150 ms. from its mouth. This is a prosperous portvessels of 140 tons can be navigated to the foot of the falls. It derives its name from Prince Frederick, father of George III. and was founded in 1727, on what was originally called the lease land, and contained when first laid out, 50 acres,—in 1742 the boundaries of the town were enlarged, and still further enlarged in 1759. The town is seated in a rich valley, the view of which from any of the neighbouring hills is exceedingly beautiful. It is incorporated, the management of its affairs are entrusted to a Mayor at $400 per annum, and a common Council without salaries. The corporation owes about $16,000, but holds real property to a much larger amount. The public buildings are a C. H., clerk's office and jail, a neat brick market house abundantly supplied with all kinds of meats, fish and vegetables. There are 5 houses of public worship, 1 Episcopalian, 1 Presbyterian, 1 Methodist, 1 Baptist and 1 Reformed Baptist, 5 male and 7 female schools, besides 2 free schools, 1 male and 1 female, which are incorporated and endowed, the former having 40, and the latter 18 pupils, and to each of the above churches is attached a Sunday school. There are 1 orphan asylum, 4 taverns and 97 licensed stores, 2 printing offices, the Virginia Herald and the Political Arena, each issuing a semi-weekly paper. The former of these is the oldest paper in Virginia. The principal mechanical pursuits are 3 tanneries and 3 saddlers, besides house carpenters, iron founders, cabinet makers, tailors, boot and shoe makers, house, sign and ornamental painters, stone cutters, brick layers blacksmiths, watch makers, tallow chandlers, tin plate workers, copper smiths, gun smiths, hatters, butchers, bakers, machinists, coach makers and trimmers, carvers and gilders, stucco workers, plaisterers, plumbers, turners and confectioners. This town is supplied with 3 kinds of fuel, viz:— wood from the neighborhood, by land and by the canal, the lower part of which is now open, bituminous coal from Richmond, and the anthracite, and is supplied with water, through aqueducts, constructed by an incorporated company. In the immediate vicinity are found vast quantities of very fine granite and free stone. A canal is now in progress to connect this town with Fox's mill, a point on the river 35 ms. above. There are annually exported from this town 75,000 barrels of flour, 150,000 bushels of wheat, 400 hogsheads of tobacco, about 500,000 bushels of Indian corn, 500 tierces of flax seed, and between 65 and $70,000 worth of gold, &amp;c. In the year 1738 a law was passed directing that "Fairs should be held in Fredericksburg twice a year for the sale of cattle, provisions, goods, wares and all kinds of merchandize whatsoever." All persons at such Fairs, going to or from them, were priviledged from arrest and execution—during the Fairs, and for 2 days before and 2 days after them, except for capital offences, breaches of the peace, or for any controversies, suits and quarrels that might arise during the time. These Fairs were continued from time to time, by various acts until 1769 when the right of holding them was made perpetual. Population, whites 1,797 persons; of whom 16 are resident attorneys, and 6 regular physicians slaves, 1,124; free blacks, 387. Total 3,308. Lewis's Store, P. O. 59 ms. from R. and 84 ms. from W.

W. of F., 5 ms. S. of Spottsylvania C. H. 6 ms. N. W. of New Market, 10 ms. N. of Dabney Mills, and 7 ms. N. E. of Lewis's Store. Partlow, P. O. 59 ms. N. of R. and 79 ms. S. S. W. of W. SPOTTSYLVANIA C. H. P. O. situated about the centre of the county, on Po river. County Courts are held on the 2d Thursday in every month;—Quarterly in March, May, August and November. Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery are held on the 23d of May and August, by Judge Lomax. Thomburg, P. V. 69 ms. from R. and 70 ms. S. W. of W., situated 14 ms. S. of Fredericksburg. A part of the village is on the N. and a part on the S. side of the river Ta. It contains several dwelling houses, 1 mercantile store, 1 house of entertainment, 1 general mill, running 3 pair of stones, 1 tanyard and a blacksmith's shop, 1 common school; and there is in the vicinity a Baptist house of public worship. The mail arrives only once a week. Todd's Store, P. O. 80 ms. from R. and 70 ms. from W. Twyman's Store, P. O. 99 ms. from R. and 89 ms, S. W. of W. Wilderness, P. O. on the north western border of the county, 81 ms. from R. and 71 ms. S. S. W. of W., situated on the turnpike road, 15 ms. from Fredericksburg. It contains several dwelling houses, 1 extensive mercantile store, 1 tavern, a tailor's and a blacksmith's shop. This place is situated in a healthy country, which produces corn, oats, barley, wheat, tobacco, rye, potatoes, hemp, flax, &amp;c. Much gold is found in the vicinity, and several gold establishments in active operation, some of which are worked to great advantage and profit. These gold operations, have already produced a very sensible effect upon this section of country, bringing a considerable amount of capital into active use, and making business brisk. Should the mining business continue to improve, of which there is at present no doubt, this place must increase considerably in importance. The mail from Fredericksburg to Charlottesville, and a horse mail from Louisa pass daily. Fifteen mails a week are received. STAFFORD. Stafford was created by act of Assembly 1675, and formed out of a part of Westmoreland county. It is bounded on the N. by Prince William,—E. by the Potomac river, separating it from Charles Co. Md.,— S. E. by King George county,—S. by the Rappahannock which separates it from Caroline county,—S. W. by Spottsylvania,—W. by Culpeper,— and N. W. by Fauquier. Near lat. 38° 25′, long 0° 22′ W. of W. C.— Length 20 miles; mean width 12,—and area 300 square miles. Its surface is hilly, and generally poor. The agricultural productions are whear, rye, corn, oats, hay, tobacco, &amp;c. The soil is of a varied character. On the Potomac it is of a light loam, which is very productive, and is interspersed with beds of shell marl of the richest quality. Contiguous to this division of the county, there is a tract of land six or eight miles in width and extending through the entire length of the county, which abounds with free stone of excellent quality. Large quantities of this article are exported to supply the demands of Washington, Baltimore, Norfolk and various other places. The soil in this free stone region is of a sandy nature, and less productive than the loam in the more immediate vicinity of the Potomac. In the remaining portion of Stafford the soil is a clay of varying color and consistency, and with proper husbandry produces good crops of wheat. The species of stone found here are granite, quartz, &amp;c. A vein of gold ore extends through this part of the county, which is represented to be equal in richness to any that has been discovered in Virginia. There are three considerable creeks in the county, viz: Aquia, Potomac, and Accokeek; all of which admit the tides from Potomac river. The two first named are navigable by schooners for several miles in the interior, and in common with the river affords valuable sites for herring fisheries. There are nine houses of public worship in this county—4 Baptist, 2 Methodist, 1 Presbyterian, and 2 free for all denominations. Population 1820, 9,517—in 1830, 9,362. It belongs to the sixth judicial circuit and third district. Taxes paid in 1833, $2085 32—in 1834 on lots, 118 63—on land, $1179 73—1816 slaves, $454 00—1690 horses, $101 40—4 studs, $43 00—30 coaches, $64 00—47 carryalls, $47 00— 29 gigs, $18 05.

It has rapidly improved— containing 70 dwelling houses, 12 general stores, 1 house of public worship free for all denominations, 1 common school, 1 masonic hall, 1 druggist shop, 3 merchant mills, manufacturing about 30,000 barrels of flour annually, and inspecting 60,000, 3 grist mills, 1 in the town and 2 in its immediate vicinity, (one of which is situated on the site of an old forge, at which was the largest manufactory of arms during the revolution,) 1 tanyard, 1 tailor, 2 blacksmith shops, and 1 buhr mill stone factory. The handsomest bridge across the Rappahannock is situated at this place. Population about 500, persons, of whom 2 are attorneys and 3 regular physicians. Spottedville, P. O. 69 ms. from R. and 79 from W., situated 12 ms. N. W. of Falmouth, on the stage road leading from Winchester and Warrenton to Fredericksburg, and in the immediate vicinity of several gold mines. Spottedville is the hameof a P. O. which stands 4 ms. above the place at which the road forks. At the latter place are situated a tavern, a mercantile store, a Baptist and a Methodist house of public worship. At this place a road to Stafford C. H. 16 ms. distant, intersects one to Richard's Ferry, and the Rattle Snake gold mines, one to Jeffersonton in Culpeper, and one to Summerville, Elk Run, and Warrenton. STAFFORD C. H. P. V. 76 ms. N.

Population 44 persons; of whom 1 is an attorney and 1 a physician. County Courts are held on the 4th Monday in every month.—Quarterly in March, May, August and November. Judge Baker holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 25th of April, and 15th of October. SUSSEX. Sussex was created by the legislature in 1754, and taken from a part of the county of Surry. It is bounded on the N. by Prince George, N. E. by Surry, S. E. and S. by Southampton, and W. by Dinwiddie. Its length from S. W. to N. E. is 37 ms.; mean breadth 16 ms.; and area 592 sq. ms. It extends in lat from 36° 42′, to 37° 07′ N. and in long. from 0° 02′ E. to 0° 46′ W. of W. C. The southern parts are drained into Three creek, a branch of Nottoway,—its central parts into Nottoway river, and its northern parts into Blackwater river. Population in 1810, 11,362—1820, 11,884—1830, 12,720. It belongs to the second judicial circuit, and first district. Tax paid in 1833, $2,729 44—in 1834, on land, $1,206 01— 4,067 slaves, $1,016 75—1,974 horses, $118 44—3 studs, $25 00—72 coaches, $188 25—12 carryalls $12 00—257 gigs, $145 10. Total, $2,711 55.

E. of R. and 172 ms. from W. Stoney Creek Warehouse, P. O. 43 ms. from R. and 165 ms. from W. This P. O. has been recently moved from Rowanty creek, and is now situated on the Petersburg Rail Road, immediately on the south bank of Rowanty creek, over which the Rail Road passes, by means of a bridge 110 ft. in length, built on the lattice plan of Towns. The warehouse is one of the depots, substantially built with a turn out station immediately through it. The house is 70 ft. by 30. The engine and cars pass thro' when ever necessary, to prevent the obstruction of each other, or loading and unloading, &amp;c. The locomotive engines with their trains of cars and coaches pass and repass daily, with the exception of Sunday, when the train carrying the mail only has the privilege. The United States southern mail, together with the small mails for the adjacent post offices are carried by these locomotives. The produce of the Roanoke and the intermediate country are transported by this road with facility, and in great quantity and variety. Five ms. S. of this place, the road passes Nottoway river, by means of a similar bridge of the same length and construction. The improvements at Stoney creek, besides the warehouse, are a handsome and commodious building just completed, intended for a tavern, 1 mercantile store and the houses of several mechanics. In the vicinity are 3 houses of public worship, (2 Methodist and 1 Baptist,) 4 well established grist and 2 saw mills. This depot is 9 ms. west of the C. H. and 3 ms. from the junction of Stoney and Rowanty creeks, with the Nottoway river,—all of which streams afford a moderate supply of shad in their season, and an abundance of small fish at all times. The lands are generally fertile and well adapted to the culture of Indian corn, wheat, oats and tobacco. The neighboring low grounds and swamps afford quantities of white oak and pine timber, from which are manufactured an abundance of pipe and other staves, and sent by the Rail Road, together with other lumber to Petersburg. Judging by the progress of improvement since the company built this warehouse, it is reasonable to anticipate, that at no distant day a thriving and handsome little village will spring up. The neighborhood is supplied with excellent water, and thickly settled with industrious and wealthy farmers. SUSSEX C. H. P. O. 50 ms. S. S. E. of R. and 172 ms. S. W. of W. situated about the centre of the Co. County Courts are held on the 1st Thursday in every month;—Quarterly in March, May, August and October. Judge May holds his Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery on the 10th of May and October. WARWICK. Warwick was one of the eight original shires into which Virginia was divided by the legislature in 1634, under the name of Warwick river. It is bounded on the N. by York county, E. by Elizabeth City county, S. by James river which separates it from Isle of Wight, and W. by James City county. Its length diagonally from south east to north west is 18 ms.; mean width 7½; and area 95 sq. ms. It extends in lat. from 37° 03′, to 37° 13′ north, and in long. from 0° 22′, to 0° 38′ east of Washington City. It occupies a portion of the narrow peninsula which runs down between York and James rivers, and slopes towards the latter. Population in 1810, 1,835 —in 1820, 1,608—1830, 1,570. It belongs to the third judicial circuit, and second district. Tax paid in 1834, on land, $170 64—544 slaves, $136 00—230 horses, $13 80—3 coaches, $8 00—2 carryalls, $2 00— 36 gigs, $20 30.

County Courts are held on the 2d Thursday in every month;—Quarterly in March, May, August and November. Judge Upshur holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 29th of April and September. WESTMORELAND. Westmoreland county is situated on the N. E. frontier of Virginia, and occupies an intermediate space in that range of counties embraced between the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers—commonly designated as the Northern Neck. The first mention which has been found of this county is in an act* * Henning's Stat. at Large, 381. of the "Grand Assembly" of July 1653; by which Act, "It is ordered, that the bounds of the county of Westmoreland be as followeth, (viz.) from Machoactoke river, where Mr. Cole lives, and so upwards to the falls of the great river Pawtomake, above the Necostin's towne." From the language of this statute it would seem that the county was previously in existence; but it is not ascertained at what time it was taken from the older county of Northumberland (at first called Chicawane or Chickcown) which was established in 1648, and declared by an act of that year to contain the "neck of land between Rappahannock river and Potomack river."† † Henning's Stat. at Large, 352. The large extent which was at first given to Westmoreland has been greatly diminished, so that at present it lies between 38° 29′ N. lat. and 37 0° 30′ E. long. from W.; and is bounded on the N. E. by the Potomac river on the N. W. by King George county,—on the S. by the Rappahannock and Richmond counties—and on the S. E. by the county of Northumberland. Its length is about 30 miles, and its mean breadth 9½ ms. and is estimated to contain an area of 335 sq. ms. The county is indented by numerous water courses, chiefly tributary to the Potomac. The first in importance is Nominy (or Nomini) bay, an arm of the Potomac, and extending five miles in length and one in breadth. Its mean depth is 8 feet. It affords a safe harbor for vessels of small burden. Into this bay flows Nominy river, which is navigable for vessels of burden for about 7 miles from its mouth, and for boats two miles farther. The creeks running into the Potomac are—Monroe's, navigable for vessels and for boats for about 4 miles from its mouth; Mattox, for vessels of burden as far as the bridge about 3 miles, and for boats 3 or 4 miles beyond; Pope's creek, navigable about 2 miles for boats only. These creeks are situated in the N. W. part of the county. To the N. E. are found, Chantilly or Gold Harbor creek, navigable for boats only about one mile; Lower Machodoc, four miles for vessels and for boats 1 mile higher. Into Nominy bay empty—Currisman creek, navigable about 1 mile— Poor Jack, about 1 mile and a quarter; Smart's, about three-quarters of a mils by boats only. Buckner's creek flows into Nominy river, and may be navigated by small craft for 3 miles, and 1 mile farther by boats; Yocomico river receives the waters of Garner's, Jackson's and Bonum's creeks: the first navigable for 2 miles—the second for 1 mile and a quarter, and the last for one and a half miles for boats only. Glebe creek may be here mentioned, flowing into the Potomac midway between Buckner's and Yocomico, and navigable for vessels of light burden for one or two miles. In the western part of the county Baldwin's and Brockenbrough's creeks run into the Rappahannock. They are believed to be wholly unnavigable. Most of these waters abound with the finest fish, oysters and wild fowl; which furnish the means of subsistence to many of the poor, and spread the richest repasts* * The good people of Westmoreland, however frugal and temperate in all things else, discover a highly epicurean taste for these "luxuries of the deep." Although so abundant and so accessible—they loose none of their value from this cause—but are nevertheless held in the highest estimation— "As if increase of appetite grew" "By what it fed on." of luxury on the tables of the wealthy. The face of the county is diversified by hills and flat land. A range of the former, pursuing a S. E. and N. W. course, penetrates the entire county longitudinally, and divides the waters of the Potomac and Rappahannock. Upon the summit of this range, at various intervals are situated several private mansions, from which can be seen in opposite directions the waters of the majestic Potomac, and of the gently meandering Rappahannock, with extensive plains intervening—exhibiting to the delightful eye of every lover of natural scenery, the most beautiful and variegated landscapes. The soil on either river, and adjacent to the creeks, is fertile and productive, and remarkably well adapted to the growth of Indian corn and wheat; the two kinds of grain chiefly cultivated. That on the Potomac and its tributaries consists of a rich argillacious, loamy mixture. That on the Bappahannock contains a greater measure of sand; and though not inferior in fertility, is from this cause better suited to the production of corn than wheat. The middle or forest lands are, for the most part sterile— are covered with a thick growth of pine and cedar and exhibit all the symptoms of early exhaustion from the successive culture of tobacco, and neglect of improvement. They are not irreclaimable; for experiment has proved that these lands are susceptible of the highest degree of improvement by the aid of clover and plaster; and they have in many instances gratefully repaid the attentions of the husbandman by the production of ample and abundant crops. This is peculiarly the case with that section of the county which lies above, or to the N. W. of the Court House. And the same remarks will apply with nearly equal propriety to that portion which is situated below, or to S. and S. E. of the C. H. Hitherto, indeed, but little regard has been paid to system in agricultural improvement. But within the last few years an honorable and praiseworthy emulation has been excited among the farmers to excel in skill and industry; and whilst greater neatness and arrangement have marked this increased attention to the farming operations, more plentiful returns and an advanced fertility in the condition of the soil, are most happily manifested. Wheat and corn are the staple productions: though other crops are grown—such as rye, oats and cotton, &amp;c., which are principally used in domestic consumption. Cord wood (pine, hickory and oak, and some tanbark, but chiefly the former) has been extensively exported from the county to the cities of the District, and to Baltimore, and has proved a source of lucrative commerce. It is estimated that upwards of 15,000 cords have been shipped in one year from the county. Westmoreland possesses but few antiquities or natural curiosities; and none of sufficient interest and importance to distinguish its history, or impart attractions to its geography, none from which the philosopher of nature or of man could glean new materials for useful remark or ingenious speculation, either to enlarge the circle of physical science, or to illustrate the manners and customs of an antecedent race of human beings. Of the curiosities of nature the most interesting perhaps is the cliffs on the Potomac. These rise abruptly from the water's edge and form a precipice of between two and three hundred feet high—extending to a distance of more than four miles along the course of the river. In the sides of these cliffs at intervals from their base to their summit are found embedded the remains of various kinds of fish and other animals—denoting according to the received theory on the subject, an antediluvian existence of these animals. Many fossil remains have also been found deeply deposited beneath the surface of the earth, far in the interior of the county and in a champaign region—some curious specimens of which are in the possession of a gentleman residing near the Court house, who has made several rare collections of the kind. Though there is presented but little here of importance to arrest the eye of the stranger, yet to the citizen of the county there are some objects of peculiar attraction and interest. These are the birthplaces and former residences of some of the sons of Westmoreland and the most distinguished men of our country. The ruins of Chantilly, situated upon the Potomac —once the residence of Richard Henry Lee, are still exhibited. Within a few miles of the same river and higher up may be seen Stradford, the family seat of the Lee's for many generations; and latterly of Gen'l Henry Lee. On Pope's creek the scarcely distinguished remains of a house are discovered, which tradition designates as the spot on which the illustrious WASHINGTON was born.* * We subjoin this note from another pen: "General Washington was born on a plantation called Wakefield, now the property of John Gray, Esq. of Traveller's Rest, lying on Pope's Creek, in Westmoreland county, Va. The house in which he first saw light, was 300 yards from the creek, half a mile from its entrance into the Potomac. The mansion has long since fallen into ruins. Some of the trees of "olden days," are yet standing around it. There is nothing at present to interest, except the recollections that must crowd upon the mind, while contemplating the birth place of Washington." In a few years these will have become obliterated, as they are now barely perceptible, and not a stone be left to point the inquisitive patriot to the place that gave birth to the "Father of his county." Ought not the spot to be rescued from the oblivion to which it is destined by the effects of time and the incursions of the ploughshare? Does it not merit from the hands of his countrymen a durable memorial of the incident by which it is marked? Let the public of Virginia answer. —At the head of Monroe's creek is a spot also known as remarkable for the birth of the late President James Monroe. In the Hall of Justice hangs a full length portrait of the Earl of Chatham. This painting was executed by Peel, and presented by Edmund Jennings, Esq. merchant of London, to the "Gentlemen of Westmoreland," in 1768, through the hands of R. H. Lee. The letters of Mr. Jennings to Mr. Lee upon its presentation, are preserved in the clerk's office among the archives of the county. The picture represents Lord Chatham, in the costume of a Roman Senator—with head, arms and legs bare, and holding in his left hand a copy of Magna Charta; and obliquely to his right in the foreground is presented an altar with the flame of liberty issuing forth—and upon it desposited a civic wreath. But however destitute this county is of natural curiosities and works of art—yet there are events connected with her history, already partially alluded to, which furnish abundant cause to her citizens to exult in her fame, and justify them in claiming for their county the classical appellation of the Athens of Virginia. Some of the most renowned men of this country were born within her borders. Of these may be mentioned Washington, R. H. Lee and his three brothers, Thomas, Francis and Arthur, Gen'l Henry Lee, the late Judge Bushrod Washington, and the late President James Monroe—names of the highest distinction for wisdom, patriotism, eloquence, learning, fortitude and valor, and which of themselves would render illustrious the history of any country. To have given birth to these distinguished men and fathers of the American Republic, is a source of cherished pride and honor to the citizens of Westmoreland, and they refer to these incidents as constituting a brilliant epoch in the annals of their county—and as vindicating for it a clear and undisputed title to the classic name they have appropriated to it. Should centuries elapse before it again attains distinction for its moral and intellectual character— it has acquired a fame venerable and immortal, that must descend conspicuous to all future ages. The population of this county in 1810 was 8,102—in 1820, 6,901—in 1830, 8,411—of whom 3,718 were whites—3,845 slaves, and 848 free persons of color. It belongs to the fifth judicial circuit, and third district. Tax paid in 1834 on lots, $9 19—land, $806 92—1963 slaves, $490 75— 1045 horses, $62 70—3 studs, $38 00—34 coaches, $81 25—13 carryalls, $13 00—99 gigs, $58 45. Total, $1560 26. Expended in educating poor children in 1833, $240 46. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Hague, P. O. situated in the eastern part of the county 70 ms. S. E. of R., and 132 from W. Huttsville, P.

This post office has recently been removed from Mattox Bridge. Oak Grove is situated equidistant (6 ms.) from the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers, and one mile from Mattox creek. It contains 4 divelling houses, 1 house of public worship, (Methodist) 3 mercantile stores, (and 2 oth is in the immediate vicinity,) 1 tavern, and 1 house of private entertainment. The soil in the neighborhood is generally fertile and well adapted to the culture of Indian corn, wheat, tobacco, cotton, &amp;c. Though the two first articles are almost solely cultivated next to these the principal article of trade is wood; so brisk is the sale, and so large the supply, that 4 or 5 vessels and frequently more are continually loading at Mattox bridge. The facilities of commerce are so great with the District of Columbia, Baltimore, Fredericksburg and other places, that no large village can ever be expected to spring up here. The neighborhood is thickly settled, and country stores are to be met with at intervals of every 4 or 5 miles. The scenery of the surrounding country is beautiful and picturesque, and would well repay those who have money and leisure in paying a visit to this vicinity, not far from which is the birthplaces of the illustrious Washington, Marshall, Monroe, and other distinguished men. WESTMORELAND C. H. P. V. 70 ms. from R. and 116 S. S. E. of W., situated near the centre of the county, being equidistant between the rivers Rappahannock and Potomac. The houses are but few, and arranged with ut regard to order or compactness, of these 8 are built of brick, including the Court House, Clerk's office and jail,—the rest are of wood, very old and much dilapidated. It contains 2 general mercantile stores, 2 taverns 1 carriage maker, 1 saddler, 1 boot and shoe maker, and 1 tailor. Population about 100 persons; of whom 5 are resident attorneys, and 3 regular physicians. County Courts are held on the 4th Monday in every month—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Lomax holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 21st of April and 13th October. YORK. York was one of the eight original shires into which Virginia, was divided by the legislature, in 1634. It is bounded on the N. by York river, which separates it from Gloucester, E. by the Chesapeake bay, S. by Elizabeth City and Warwick counties, and W. by James City county. Its mean length is 26 ms.; mean breath 5¾ ms.; and area 149 sq. ms. It extends in lat. from 37° 08′, to 37° 23′ N. and in long from 0° 12′, to 0° 46′ E. of W. This county occupies nearly half of the peninsula which is formed by the near approach of the York and James rivers; but the surface inclines towards the former, on which it lies. Much of the soil is good. Population in 1810, 5,187—in 1820, 14,380—1830, 5,334. York belongs to the 3rd judicial circuit, and 2nd district. Tax paid in 1833, $802 06—in 1834, on lots, $31 69—on land, $1,261 50—1,220 slaves, $305 00—365 horses, $33 90—5 studs, $20 00—12 coaches, $24 00—7 carryalls, $7 00—72 gigs, $40 35. Total, $823 45.

E. by E. of R. and 187 ms. from W., situated in the eastern part of the county, about 12 ms. S. E. of the C. H. and half a mile from Poquosin river. There are at this place 5 buildings, 2 of which are old stores, not occupied at present, 1 public house, and 1 excellent dwelling house. The land in the neighborhood is fertile, producing well the ordinary staples, corn, wheat, oats, &amp;c. The situation is pleasant and eligible, directly on the main stage road from Yorktown to Hampton. YORKTOWN, P. V. Port of entry and seat of justice, 72 ms. S. E. by E. of R. and 175 ms. S. S. E. of W. in lat. 37° 14′, and long 0° 30′ E. of W. C., situated immediately on the right bank of York river, 11 ms. above its mouth, and 33 ms. N. W. from Norfolk. Yorktown suffered considerably from a fire which occurred during the last war, when most of the best buildings were destroyed, together with the old Episcopal church. The present number of houses, besides the county buildings, are 40,—the most of which are going fast to decay. It has several stores, 1 house of public worship (Baptist,) 1 school, in which are taught the rudiments of English education, 1 tanyard, 1 cabinet maker, 1 carriage maker, 1 house carpenter, and 3 blacksmith shops. Yorktown is pleasantly situated in an open country, having a beautiful view of land and water scenery. Population 282 persons; of whom 1 is an attorney, and 2 are regular physicians. County Courts are held on the 3d Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery are held on the 24th of April and September, by Judge Upshur. Before closing Eastern Virginia it may be interesting to the reader to peruse a succinct account of the memorable events which took place at the siege of Yorktown during the revolution, and which eventuated in the surrender of the whole of the English army, under the command of Lord Cornwallis, to the combined American and French army, under the command of Washington, which was the closing scene of the American war, and the establishment of American independence. The following brief outline seems to have been taken from the journal of an American officer, engaged in the scenes which he describes, and to have been published in some periodical about the year 1784 or 1785. Siege of York and Gloucester. Sept. 15, 1781.—General Washington arrived at Williamsburg; received the Marquis de la Fayette's command, and count St. Simon's troops, which had arrived the 30th of August, with count de Grasse, and landed at Jamestown the 3d instant. 21.—First division of the northern army arrived in James's river. The 23d and 24th almost the whole got in and landed. The 27th, the whole army moved, and encamped in a line, three quarters of a mile advanced off Williamsburg, distant from Yorktown 11 miles. 28.—The whole moved at daylight: after two halts, arrived within a mile and a half of the enemy's works displayed and lay on our arms all night. Beaver pond creek, and morass in our front, over which bridges were built that night: and general Muhlenbergh's brigade of light infantry formed a picquet in advance. 29.—About sunrise moved to within three quarters of a mile of the enemy's out-works, and displayed into two lines, a ravine in front, to view our ground, advanced small parties in front to cover our reconnoitering parties. At four, P. M. moved to our ground on the right, and encamped within range of the enemy's artillery in two lines; advanced a line of picquets in front, and increased our camp guards. 30.—The enemy fearing we should turn their left, and get between their out-works and the town, abandoned the whole of them, and retired to town a little before day-light, leaving a few light horse to protect their rear. Colonel Scammel, being officer of the day, advanced to reconnoitre and report accordingly, when he was intercepted, wounded and taken, by a few light horse, who had lain concealed. [He died of his wounds in six days.] Both lines were put in motion, and advanced with caution towards their works, suspecting some feint of the enemy. Lay on our arms all that night. The light infantry remained on the ground, as a covering party to the fatigued men, busied in erecting a chain of redoubts to guard our camp, and cover our working parties, who were occupied in procuring materials for the siege. 31.—The light infantry relieved by Wayne's division this evening. The redoubts completed this night, and filled with a proper number of troops. October 1 to 6.—Employed in preparing materials, getting up our artillery, &amp;c. At six o'clock, moved on the ground, and opened our first parallel, about six hundred yards from the enemy's works, under cover by day-light. No accident. Continued working till morning. 7.—The light troops entered in line reversed, with drums beating, and colours flying; planted their standards on the top of the line of the parallel: continued working on the batteries, which were completed about five o'clock. 9.—P. M. the enemy received the first shot from us, which was continued with spirit from cannon and mortars. The enemy's fire slackened. Several of their guns were dismounted and they were obliged to fill up their entrenchments. 10.—Light infantry mounted; and the Charon of 44 guns and two smaller vessels, were burned by some hot shot from the left of the line, commanded by count St. Simon. This happened about eight o'clock in the evening, the weather being serene and calm, and afforded an awful and melancholly sight. The Charon was on fire from the water's edge to her truck at the same time. I never saw any thing so magnificent. 11.—In the evening, the second parallel opened by B. Steuben's division. This parallel was carried on with amazing rapidity, at 360 yards distance from the enemy's batteries, under a very heavy fire, the enemy's shot and shells directed at the workmen; our shot and shells going over our heads in a continual blaze the whole night. The sight was beautifully tremendous. We lost but one man, shot by our own men, the gun not being sufficiently elevated, or being fired with a bad cartridge. 12th, 13th, and 14th. Continued completing the batteries of the second parallel, and wounding their abattis, and frize-works with our shot and shells. About two o'clock, P. M. the out defences of two redoubts, that were advanced on their left 250 yards in their front, were thought sufficiently weakened, to attempt them that evening by storm. The light infantry were relieved, and directed to refresh themselves with dinner and a nap. About dusk, they moved on, under the Marquis, and were in possession of one, in nine minutes. The other was carried by the French grenadiers and light infantry, under baron Viomenil, nearly about the same time, when the second parallel was continued on, and enveloped these two redoubts, and finished a line of communication between the rights of the first and second parallel of upwards of a mile, before day-light next morning. The whole of this was performed under a very incessant and heavy fire from the enemy, with amazing steadiness and expedition. 15.—Employed in repairing the redoubts, and erecting batteries, now within reach of the enemy's grape, rifle and wall-pieces. 16.—This night, a timid, ill conducted sortie was attempted under lieutenant-colonel Abercrombie, with about six hundred men. They entered the parallel about the centre, nearly between the French and American troops, at a battery erecting by the Americans, not completed. They killed a sarjeant and two privates of captain Savage's company of artillery: spiked six guns with the end of their bayonets, which they broke off in the vent-holes; turned about; and went off with the greatest precipitation. In their retreat, they were pursued, and lost twelve men—six killed, four wounded, two taken: the light infantry in the trenches. Lord Cornwallis, in his account of the matter, says our loss was upwards of 100. 17.—Light infantry still in the trenches. Between ten and eleven, A. M. chamade beat, and propositions for surrender sent out by his lordship: received by the Marquis, and forwarded to head-quarters. Cessation of firing about twenty minutes, till flag had returned within their works. On our resuming the fire, a second chamade beat, and the officer returning, was told that the answer, as soon as received from head-quarters, would be forwarded. The firing on both sides re-commenced, and went on as usual, only small intermissions, during the passing of two or three letters from each side. Light infantry relieved by the baron Steuben's division and the business being concluded that evening, the firing ceased about five o'clock, P. M. The 18th and part of the 19th, taken up in adjusting matters, viz. articles of capitulation, public letters, &amp;c. 19. P. M.—They marched out and laid down their arms. The whole of the king's troop, including sailors and marines, amounted to 8,054, officers included. Thus ended this business, in nine days from our breaking ground. The whole of our strength, including every person that drew provisions by the commissary-general's return, amounted to 12,200. Our loss was 324 killed, wounded and died in the hospital; sick in the hospital about 600; unfit for duty, 830. So that when the necessary detail of the whole army was completed, his lordship was never opposed by more than an equal number. Very frequently, from our great fatigue, parties at a considerable distance from the camp, and trenches two miles, had he come out to us, we could have opposed him with but very few more than two thirds of his number. This, I believe, will be allowed by any officer of discernment, who was acquainted with the details of the victorious combined army. 38 WESTERN VIRGINIA. INTRODUCTION. Perhaps no section of country of the same extent, possesses greater natural advantages than that portion of the State of Virginia westward of the Blue Ridge Mountain. Possessed of a climate the most salubrious and invigorating, and a soil happily adapted to the production of almost every thing useful to man, nothing is wanting but industry to render this one of the fairest agricultural portions of the globe. The vallies of the Shenandoah, the Upper James river, the Kanawha and Holston, found in this portion of the commonwealth, present a field almost unrivalled for the exertions of an industrious and enterprising population. Some of these as yet, are comparatively unreclaimed and in a state of nature, but the time is not distant, when under the invigorating influence of wise and salutary regulations, they will be seen teeming with the products of enterprise and industry. But Western Virginia is not remarkable only for agricultural advantages. Her fossil and mineral wealth is no where equaled; iron, lead, gypsum, coal, and salt, are found in different places in this region, some of which have already become a fruitful source of commerce and of wealth. Other and similar sources of wealth may still be buried and concealed from the eye of man in our extensive forest regions. The salt of the Kanawha and Holston, after supplying the home consumption, is already an article of extensive and profitable commerce upon most of the western waters. The iron of the valley, the excellence of which is readily admitted, would soon become a staple of commerce and a source of wealth to that section, did the improvements of the country supply the required facilities for the transportation of so cumbersome an article. These enumerated manufactures, though already claiming notice from their consequence, are to be regarded as yet in their infancy, compared with the rank they will hereafter attain, in numbers and extent, should the increasing commerce and enterprise of the country call forth their resources. With the exception of the commercial channels which nature has provided as outlets for them, our productions, whether manufactured or agricultural, are and must be limited to a narrow region of country surrounding them. This will continue to be the case until the country becomes aroused to the necessity of following the example of our sister communities, in opening additional and much needed lines of commercial intercourse. Had nature been even more bountiful than she has to this favored region, still if her gifts are neglected or unimproved, no benefits result to the community. Such is in fact the condition of Western Virginia. We possess natural advantages in abundance, every thing for skill and enterprise and industry to work upon, but no corresponding results such as are elsewhere exhibited, are any where seen. This state of things merits an attentive consideration and demands an adequate remedy. Let the citizens of Western Virginia arouse themselves, and harmoniously unite in efforts to improve their condition and bring into active and profitable exercise the numerous discovered and undiscovered sources of wealth with which our country abounds. GENERAL DESCRIPTION. This division of the commonwealth, as recognized by the constitution of 1830, extends from the Blue Ridge to the Ohio, and contains forty-five counties, with an area of 38,900 square miles, equal to 24,896,000 acres. The population in 1830, was 378,475, of which the free inhabitants numbered 324,988, and the slaves 53,437—shewing an increase of nearly 25 per cent in the first class, and nearly 24 per cent in the second, within the preceding ten years. This sparse population of less than ten souls to a square mile, is not owing to either a want of salubrity in the climate, or of fertility in the soil, but to adventitious causes which time is progressively removing. The early policy of the general government in bringing large bodies of the public domain into market, at very low prices, and on long credits, with the recent diminution of three-eights of the former prices placed on those lands, have exercised a very important control over the settlement and consequent improvement of this part of Virginia. The nearer districts of level and fertile land in the New States, are however receiving a sufficient population to give increased value to the soil, and the government sales at more distant points become less sensibly felt, but should the threatening efforts now making to employ the Public Lands as a bounty to draw off the inhabitants of the old States, by giving new homes to all who will occupy them, at merely nominal prices, prove successful, no portion of the original states will feel the effects more sensibly than Virginia, and particularly the district under consideration. The retarded population of the western counties, has also been owing in some measure to the unsettled state of the land titles; an evil which recent legislation has gone far to remove. By an act of the 5th of February, 1831, the limitation in writs of right is reduced to twenty-five years and in actions of ejectment, to fifteen years and by an act of the 10th of March, 1832, a lein is given on lands, in favor of the occupant thereof, for the value of the improvements which may be made thereon, before notice of the adverse title. The first of these laws gives safety and security to the great body of the land-holders, and the second gives full remuneration for all the improvements in the event of an eviction; they were called for by the condition of the country, and will no doubt give confidence to future immigrants, as well as invigorate the industry of the present inhabitants. No climate can be more favorable to health and longevity; the temperate latitude and elevation of the country; protect it in a great measure from the extremes of heat and cold, and when they occur, they are very rarely of inconvenient duration. The face of the country presents an uneven surface, owing to the ranges of mountains which intersect it from the northeast to the southwest, and which occupy much of the territory from the North mountain, and skirts the large limestone valley of Virginia, to the Cumberland and Laural Hill chain. These mountains rise from two to three thousand feet above the ocean, but are neither sterile, or unusually steep; on the contrary they are generally covered with the finest timber, and abound with kinds denoting high fertility, the vallies are frequently extensive, and present to the eye the most beautiful- and majestic scenery. The soil of this district consists of almost every variety. The great limestone valley of Virginia, extending from the Potomac to the county of Montgomery, near two hundred and fifty miles in length, and from twenty to forty miles in width, is perhaps not surpassed in the abundance and variety of its agricultural products, by any district of the same extent in the Atlantic States. From the North mountain, to the western chain of the Alleghanies, formed by the continuing links between the Cumberland and the Laurel mountains of Pennsylvania, the country presents a series of ridges and well watered vallies, the latter generally rich, and the former not unfrequently offering easy slopes to cultivation and for pasture. Along the summit of the middle range much high table land is found, and considerable portions of it free from timber, and covered with grass. Some of those natural meadows are of large extent, and serve as pasture for numerous herds of horned cattle. Although the western division of Virginia may throughout be emphatically denominated a grass country, yet it no where else equals the abundant and nutricious productions annually displayed upon those elevated table lands, and whether the grazing farm is prepared by enclosing and reclaiming the natural meadows, or by freeing the ground of its forest trees, the product is equally certain and abundant. The country extending from the Cumberland and Laurel range of mountains to the Ohio river, is generally broken; but interspersed with extensive districts of land sufficiently level for agricultural purposes, and of which industry is annually bringing large portions into culture. The Ohio and Potomac, as well as their large tributaries, are proverbial for the rich alluvial lands which border those streams. These bodies of very fertile and almost inexhaustible low grounds, vary in width from a few hundred yards to one and two miles. Sufficiently undulating to pass the water from their surface, and generally elevated above the freshets to which the western rivers are liable. These alluvial tracts are admirably adapted to the culture of hemp, tobacco, Indian coin, and turnips, and after a few years yield very fine crops of wheat, barley, rye, oats, potatoes, &amp;c. The upland as before remarked, is frequently rough and broken, but generally not so much so, as to prevent its employment in cultivation and pasture, when advancing population shall require its use for those purposes; the highest and steepest hills are well adapted to the growth and production of many of the most valuable species of the grape, and on their sides the mulberry flourishes with peculiar vigor, it may not therefore be unreasonable to anticipate the time, when wine and silk will be prominent articles of the export from this region of country. The principal agricultural products of the western district of Virginia, at this time, are wheat, rye, oats, barley, buck wheat, hemp, flax, tobacco and corn, with abundant supplies of indigenous and exotic grapes. The grazing and feeding farms, which stand next in importance, export annually a large amount in neat cattle, horses, mules, hogs and sheep, besides beef, bacon, lard, butter and wool. Of the products of the forest, the western counties furnish much the larger portion, consisting of gensang, fur, peltries, venison hams, staves, timber, plank, and cord wood on the rivers navigated with steamboats. The manufactories, although in their infancy, yield considerable supplies to other States, in flour, salt, leather, and formerly of lead. "Mountains are the mothers of minerals," and the country from the Blue Ridge to the Ohio river, fully verifies the truth of the aphorism. Although this district has as yet, but slightly attracted the notice of the scientific mineralogist, many of these useful metals and fossils have been discovered, and in some instances brought into extensive use. Iron is found in abundance on the waters of the Potomac, Shenandoah, James, Jackson and the Roanoke rivers, and at many places on the upper branches of those streams, is manufactured to great extent, and with corresponding advantage; on New river, or the Upper Kanawha and its tributaries, this valuable mineral abounds, and of the best qualities; it is also found in very encouraging quantities and exhibiting fine appearances, convenient to the waters of the Great and Little Kanawhas, Monongahela, Elk, Gauley, Guyandotte and Sandy rivers. The ores which have been discovered, present almost every variety, but those apparently most abundant, are the compact brown ore, the brown hematite, and specular ores. The salt district of Virginia, passing west of the Alleghany range, and nearly in a parallel course with those mountains, furnishes this important article in greater or less abundance, in the counties of Harrison, Lewis, Kanawha and Washington. In the two latter counties, however, are situated the principal manufactories, that of Kanawha, supplying about one million and a half of bushels per annum, and the Washington works about 100,000. An analysis of the Kanawha water, gives 35 mur of lime—2 car of iron—1 free car acid—56 chloride of sodium and bromide of calcium—and 956 moisture. The water used in the manufactory of salt in the county of Washington, contains less of the muriate, and more of the sulphate of lime, and a larger portion of the chloride of sodium. Lead of considerable quantities was long since discovered in the county of Wythe, and was formerly much used in commerce, but owing to the expensive land carriage which had to be encountered in conveying it to market, and to the opening lead mines more favorably situated on the Mississippi, those of Wythe have in a great measure fallen into disuse. Extensive beds of exifrangible gypsum are found on the upper branches of the Holston, but are comparatively useless from the want of convenient and cheap lines of transportation; and the same remark applies to the quarries of very superior buhr stone, situated near Christiansburgh, in the county of Montgomery. The coal formation of the western part of Virginia, is limited on the Kentucky border, to the country lying between the Cumberland range, and the Ohio river—extending to the northeast, the coal district spreads from the Ohio, as far eastwardly as the neighborhood of Westernport on the Potomac. Throughout this entire tract of country, bituminous coal presents itself in great abundance, in beds varying in thickness, from a few inches to 12 and 15 feet, attended every where by micacious sand-stone, conglomerate rocks, and clay slate, the latter abounding in vegetable impressions. At the salt wells on the Great Kanawha, as well as at many natural springs within the coal region, naptha is found floating on the surface of the water in considerable quantities. Anthracite Coal, to which Pennsylvania is indebted for the rapid extension of many of her important manufactories, as well as the great enlargement of her interior commerce, has been recently discovered in the counties of Berkley and Morgan. Still more recent researches have ascertained the existence of this valuable mineral, apparently in extensive bodies, in the counties of Rockingham and Augusta, from which it is probable that the great Valley of Virginia will ere long become as celebrated for the extent of its manufactories as it is now proverbial for its large agricultural products. As this district undergoes more thorough examination, and its mineral resources become further developed, it will probably disclose as extensive masses of iron and coal in the same vicinities, as now distinguish South Wales; and although the bituminous coal may contain more volatile matter, and less charcoal, than the Welch furnace coal, the value of the tar and pitch which it will yield, may more than compensate for the comparative deficiency of carbon. No quarter of the world presents a greater variety of mineral waters, than this portion of Virginia. Medicinal springs are almost as numerous as the counties, but it will suffice to notice those which have attracted the greatest share of public consideration, and which receive annually the greatest number of visitors. In the large limestone valley immediately west of the Blue Ridge, are the Berkley and Morgan springs, the Shenandoah springs, the Augusta springs, and the Botetourt springs. They are usually attended by a respectable number of visitors, and the medicinaleffects of the waters have given some reputation to each of those fountains. The county of Bath is distinguished by the Warm and Hot springs, situated within five miles of each other, and upon the principal road leading east and west, through Virginia, the great bath at the Warm Springs is universally admired by all who have enjoyed the luxury of its tepid and buoyant waters. This copious fountain of hydrosulphurous water, rises within the walls of the bath, and preserves a uniform temperature of 96° of Fr. The baths of the Hot springs differ in temperature, from 51° to 107°, and belong to the thermal saline class. These fountains may be justly placed at the head of the thermal waters of the United States, and from their use, the happiest effects have been produced in cases of chronic rheumatism and hepatic affections of long standing. In the adjoining counties of Greenbrier and Monroe, are situated the White Sulphur, the Salt Sulphur, and the Red Sulphur Springs; they are classed as cold hydrosulphurous waters; the first is peculiarly distinguished for efficacy in cases familiarly denominated bilious and liver complaints; the second for the removal of dyspepsia, and all affections of the stomach, whether connected with the state of the liver or not the third has a high reputation from the peculiar influence which its waters exercise over pulmonary affections. The Sweet Springs are also in the county of Monroe, near the eastern base of the Alleghany. This fountain, like the Berkley springs, is cold, acidulous or carborated, and yields a copious stream of the temperature of 73° of Fr. The Sweet springs have acquired a fashionable and well merited celebrity; the water is believed to be particularly serviceable in the variety of the dyspepsia, accompanied by gastrodynia or spasm. In secondary debility of the digestive canal, from the exhausting heats of summer, or in chronic diarrhea or dysentery, without fever, or not sustained by hepatic inflammation, the internal use of these waters have produced the happiest effects. These highly valuable fountains of health are so conveniently situated as to enable the visitors to alternate their use, with great advantage and satisfaction; and the several proprietors have so extended their means of accommodating company, and added so many comforts and beauties to their respective establishments, that they are now annually attended by a large concourse of fashionable people from the valley of the Mississippi, and from the middle and southern States, as well as by invalids from almost every quarter of the Union. A Spring on Muddy creek, in Greenbrier county, heretofore visited by but few persons, as the accommodations have been very limited, is beginning to attract much public interest from the highly salutary influence which the waters have produced in aggravated cases of scrofula. The favorable results experienced by persons suffering under this afflicting and inscrutable disease, induced a number of gentlemen in 1833, to unite in the purchase and improvement of the property, and measures are now in progress for erecting extensive and convenient buildings, and for giving to this spring as many attractions as are found at the most fashionable medicinal fountains. Many natural curiosities of an interesting character are to be found between the Blue Ridge and the Ohio. Those most known are Weyer's and Madison's Caves, near the Shenandoah river, and about two miles from Port Republic. These wonderful caverns are both subterranean openings in the same limestone hill. The first has been explored to the distance of 900 yards, and the latter has been penetrated to the depth of 120 yards. Madison's cave has been much disfigured by the manufacture of saltpetre, to which it was for some time appropriated. Weyer's cave is however in a fine state of preservation; the entrance is narrow, but the cavern enlarges as it advances under the hill, until some of the apartments present an extent of floor equal to 300 by 200 feet, with majestic ceiling springing to the height of 80 and 90 feet. The drippings of this cave are not sufficient to affect the lights which are necessary to its examination, or to incommode the visitors. The deposits of lime dissolved in the water, forms stalactites of almost every shape, and of every variety of beauty—curtains descending in wave-like folds from the ceiling to the floor—plain and fluted columns—colonades, various resemblances of household furniture, and marble statues, which require but little imagination to give them fair proportions, and the habiliments of the ancient Romans, are among the pleasing objects with which the sight of the visitor is regaled; the colors are for the most part white, but sometimes red, and occasionally variegated. When illuminated, the cave presents one of the most magnificent scenes in nature. There are two other caves in this limestone district that are as yet but little known, but are said to be equal if not superior in beauty and magnificence to Weyer's cave. One of these is called Allen's Cave—the other is near the top of a small mountain called Cave Hill, situated one mile west of Luray, (county seat of Page.) Allen's cave is situated in Shenandoah county, a short distance from Front Royal. Descriptions of these caves will be found in the counties in which they are located. The Natural Bridge over Cedar Creek, in the county of Rockbridge, which rises 270 feet; the Natural Tunnel, in Scott county, and the grand and majestic scenery at and around. Harper's Ferry, attract visiters from considerable distances. The Blowing cave, near the Cow Pasture river; which constantly sends forth a strong current of air; and the ebbing and flowing, or Syphon spring, on the estate of the late Capt. John Lewis, in the same valley, are objects of examination with most of the investigating travellers who visit that part of the State. On the low grounds of the Great Kanawha, about seven miles above Charleston, are several fissures in the earth through which constant streams of carburetted hydrogen gas are discharged. These are called burning springs, as the earth is so depressed around them as to collect and retain the water in ordinary seasons, and which is kept in active ebulition by the gas which is discharged through it; when inflamed, this gas burns with a pale blaze at the surface of the water, when it mixes with the atmosphere, until it is extinguished by a strong current of air. This is by no means a rare production of nature in this district, as considerable issues of it are found on Big Sandy, and Little Kanawha rivers, and in boring for salt water on the Great Kanawha, the discharges of carbureted hydrogen have been so great and continued, as to compel in one instance, the abandonment of the work. That part of the Great Kanawha which is above the mouth of Gauley, having to search its intricate way, and force its passage through a chain of lofty and rugged mountains, exhibits a series of the most stupendous cliffs from the mouth of Greenbrier to Gauley river, particularly where Gauley mountain is riven to its base by this stream in its passage to the Ohio; at this point, and near the great western turnpike, those cliffs present themselves frequently to the eye of the traveller in majestic grandeur. One of the most lofty and perpendicular was formerly designated by a hawk's nest on its side, but is now called "Marshall's Pillar," commemorative of the laborious and perilous voyage of the Chief Justice in his examination of this river in 1812. From the flat rock forming the summit, to the agitated waters below, the view is fearfully grand: few of the many who visit it, can look over this dizzy height but in a reclining position; the elevation is estimated by engineers at from 750 to 800 feet, but no actual admeasurement has yet been made. The sparse population of many parts of the country, has heretofore produced its usual effects in relation to education; schools however have been annually multiplying, and with the aid afforded by the literary fund, primary instruction is generally diffused, and becoming more elevated in its range. Well organized academies are established in many of the counties, and those of Frederick, Augusta, Washington, Greenbrier, Kanawha, and Harrison, particularly deserve notice. Washington College in Rockbridge, justly ranks among the most useful and distinguished of the southern seminaries. It received a most serviceable addition to its funds by a devise from Gen'l George Washington, which was followed by a bequest of a large estate from Mr. John Robinson, one of its early patrons, and more recently a donation of the funds of the Cincinnati society of Virginia. Thus liberally founded, and supplied with able professors, this institution contributes largely to the learning and intelligence of the country. Commercial roads and navigable canals are greatly wanted. As yet the government of Virginia has comparatively done but little towards improving the rivers and roads of this district. Among the works constructed under the direction of the State, is the James and Kanawha turnpike, leading from Covington to the town of Guyandotte on the Ohio, and to the mouth of Big Sandy river. This road passes by, or near, the principal 39 mineral springs west of the Alleghany; the work is approaching completion on the western end, and its extension is in progress eastward by the Hot and Warm Springs to the town of Staunton in Augusta. Incomplete as the work is, this road forms one of the most important avenues of intercourse between the eastern and western waters; it is much used in ordinary travelling, and in the transportation of property; and at this time daily lines of stage coaches find full employment upon the route. They are connected in the conveyance of passengers with the steam boats of the Ohio, and those of the James and Potomac rivers. On the western end, even this provision for the accommodation of passengers has been found insufficient, and a tri-weekly line has been added between the Ohio river and the White Sulphur Springs, during the visiting season. Under the direction, and with the funds of the State, a like road has been located from Winchester to Parkersburgh, on the Ohio, which when finished will confer important advantages on the northwest counties. To a joint stock company aided by the State, the Valley of Virginia has been much indebted for the improvement of the navigation of Shenandoah river. The work undertaken by the company has been so far completed, as to draw to that river an accession of trade which has increased the tolls from $604 in 1827 to $7,691 in 1831—continuing to improve with each succeeding year. The Chesapeake and Ohio canal, although passing up on the north side of the Potomac, confers important advantages on the northern border of the State, and will as it advances westward still further invigorate and extend the agricultural industry, and enlarge the commercial operations of the Virginia counties within its influence. These works undertaken, or fostered by the commonwealth, however useful, are but of minor character when compared with the important enterprize on which the government of Virginia has long deliberated, of drawing a fertilizing portion of the commerce of the Western States, to her eastern cities. Of this enterprize so long meditated and so fully discussed, we find the following account given in a memorial addressed to the General Assembly in 1826. "The Legislative Declaration, that next to the enjoyment of civil liberty itself, it might be questioned whether the best organized government could assure to those for whom all governments are instituted, a greater blessing than an open, free and easy intercourse with one another, by good roads, navigable rivers, and canals; that their tendency, by extending commerce, promoted the agriculture of a nation, and thereby augmented its wealth and population;—satisfied us that these great interests of Virginia were no longer to be neglected, and that as many of the other States were advancing in wealth and numbers with a rapidity which had astonished themselves, the ancient and elder sister of the Union would remove the reproach of her remaining stationary." "This manifest determination of the Legislature to improve the vast advantages possessed by the commonwealth, seemed to be based on considerations of so fixed and durable a character, that but little doubt was entertained by your memorialist of the achievement of the great work of connecting the eastern and western waters of Virginia, by navigable canals and turnpike roads of the most permanent construction, when water conveyance was unattainable, this measure had entered largely into the views of the proprietor of the land on which the City of Richmond and the town of Manchester now stands, and as early as the year 1767, was adverted to by that distinguished individual, in his proposition for the sale of the lots of those towns, in strong and prophetic terms. The practicability and vast advantages of opening this line of communication to the western frontier of the middle colonies, were dwelt upon as matters of great interest to the future prosperity of Virginia. Our Washington was scarcely disengaged from the toils of the camp, when turning his capacious mind to the objects tending to promote and secure the public happiness, made a communication to Gov. Harrison, in which the incalculable importance of connecting the eastern and western waters of Virginia, was enforced with zeal, and supported by considerations combining the present with the future, which must have resulted in the immediate undertaking of the work, but for the exhausted state of the Treasury. Our venerable Jefferson, partaking in the view of his distinguished friend, and equally desirous of improving and exalting his native State, made an effort to secure to this great work the influence and active direction of the father of his country; deeming its magnitude sufficient to invite his superintendence, and its completion the happiest monument of his retirement." "The continued interest manifested by our citizens in almost every quarter of the State, and the improved condition of the Treasury, induced the Legislature in 1818-14 to organize a commission for exploring and reporting on the practicability, utility and expense of effecting this long contemplated connexion, and for ascertaining the best means of securing to Virginia a due participation in the rich trade of the West. The report of our distinguished fellow-citizen, the Chief Justice of the United States, with that of other gentlemen designated with him to perform that duty, fully realized the previous anticipations, and furnished the strongest inducements for the execution of the work. The war with Great Britain, in which we were then engaged, however, compelled its postponement. The conflict over, the government of Virginia resumed this interesting subject, and after various examinations of all its details by the most experienced engineers, and with the fullest development of all its branches, by an act bearing date the 17th February 1820, determined upon the execution of the entire work, from the tide water of James river to the confluence of the Kanawha and Ohio, providing by law for the completion thereof in the following order. 1. To render the Great Kanawha navigable at all seasons of the year, for boats drawing three feet water, from the great falls to the Ohio river. 2dly To improve the navigation of James river, from tide water to Pleasant's Island, by locks and navigable canals, affording at all seasons of the year, at least three feet depth of navigable water. 3dly To make the best road practicable, at an expense of $100,000, from the mouth of Dunlap's creek, to the great falls of Kanawha. 4thly. To make navigable locks and canals, from Pleasant's Island to Dunlap's creek, furnishing at least the same depth of water for the entire distance. A measure so important in its influence over the future destinies of the State; originating with the sages of the country, the fathers of the land; sustained and approved by the wisdom of successive Legislative bodies; its practicability demonstrated by the combined science of the best qualified engineers, could not but be regarded as irrevocably determined on; the period of its completion to be hastened by all the resources of the commonwealth. Such were unquestionably the convictions of the Legislature of 1819-20, and of your memorialist." Notwithstanding the previous determination of the Legislature, and the strong inducements presented for reanimated action on the part of the government, eight years of plans and deliberations have passed by. One project after another has been proposed, considered and abandoned, while two short sections of canal on the margin of James river, and the abortive attempt to improve the navigation of the Great Kanawha, remains the monument of that indecision and procrastinating policy, which has stripped the commonwealth of her elevation in the family of States, and is so rapidly sending her people to seek new homes, where the "blessings next to civil liberty" are not only proclaimed, but practically secured. While the pen is tracing these brief notes, the General Assembly is engaged in deliberations upon this subject; but whether their labors will result in another abortive attempt to put this work in progress, or in the provision of adequate means for its entire execution, on a scale of usefulness and durability, worthy of the ancient commonwealth, and commensurate to the advantages which it ought to confer on her sister States, is extremely doubtful.* * Since this was written, the Legislature passed the act allowing the patriotic and enterprising corporation of Richmond to take $250,000, in addition to their previous subscription of $400,000, and taking the remaining $500,000 for the State; by which acts the whole amount of $5,000000 is subscribed, which was necessary to secure the charter of the James River and Kanawha Company, and the successful prosecution of this great work ensured. If Virginia should ever resume this great work with ardor and reasonable unanimity; and pursue it with constancy of purpose to its final completion, it must produce a new era in her history, and entirely change the destiny which now seems to await her. Among the high considerations that so strongly prompt her to the employment of her resources and credit in achieving this great work, the following are perhaps the most prominent. The certain participation in a large portion of the commerce of the west, the value of which is attested by the expenditures and efforts of other States to become partakers. The development of her exhaustless mineral resources, and the consequent extension of important manufactories into every section of the country. The giving to her agricultural and planting interests the highest stimulus—the creation of a rich and fertilizing interior commerce, sustaining in return the most extensive foreign trade. The rapid increase of her population with the comfort and wealth which must attend them—and the speedy and permanent advance in the value of the entire landed property of the State. Those of a political character are scarcely less important. Its connecting influence upon the States themselves and upon the two great divisions of Virginia, now hanging but loosely together, must be apparent to all, and if the Union is ever destined to crumble, such a line of intercommunication, with the connections and associations to which it must give rise, cannot fail to unite in the same destinies, the southern States, and those of the Great Valley of the Mississippi. WESTERN VIRGINIA. ALLEGHANY. Alleghany was created by the legislature in 1822, and formed from portions of Bath, Bottetourt and Monroe. It is bounded N by Bath and a small portion of Greenbrier, E. by Rockbridge and Bottetourt, S. by Monroe, and W. by Greenbrier; its mean length is 26 ms.; mean breadth 20; and area 521 sq. ms. It lies between lat 37° 35′, and 38° N and the centre about 3° W. long. from W. C. Most of this county is a high mountain valley, drained by the head waters of the James river. Pott's and Dunlap's creeks rise in Monroe and flow N. E. until they unite with Jackson's river near Covington, about the centre of the county. Jackson's river rises in Pendleton, and flowing S. through Bath, enters Alleghany, passess the gap between Peter's and the Warm Spring mountains, receives Pott's creek from the S., and then turns first N. E. and then after turning the N. E. flank of Rich Patch mountain, it flows S. E. into Bottetourt. Cow-Pasture river rises also in Pendleton, flows by a tortuous channel, nearly due S. through Bath and Alleghany, and unites with Jackson's river, soon after it passes into Bottetourt. These two rivers by their union constitute the James. Much of the surface of this county is covered with mountains; its mean level exceeds 10,000 ft above the tides of the ocean. The main Alleghany chain forms its boundary on the W. Peter's mountain and Warm Spring mountain divide the county into nearly two equal parts, having only a narrow gap at Covington. Pott or Middle mountain and Rich Patch, form its boundary on the S. E. Besides these continuous ranges, there are a number of others filling up the intervals, such as Oliver, Marris, Beard's, &amp;c. The staples of the county are grain, and its products generally the same as other counties situated in the same latitude. Population in 1830, 2,816. It belongs to the 17th judicial circuit and 9th district. Tax paid in 1833, $473 15—in 1834 on lots, $39 26—on land, $273 42 —348 slaves, $87 00—926 horses, $55 56—2 studs, $13 00—7 coaches, $12 00—5 carryalls, $5 00—2 gigs, $1 00. Total, $488 24. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $87 00—in 1833, $166 47. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Calahan's P. O. 196 ms. from R. and 238 ms. from W., situated at the junction of roads leading to the Warm, Sweet and White Sulphur Springs. COVINGTON, P. V. and Seat of Justice, 191 ms. W. of R. and 233 S. W. of W. Covington is situated at the head of the James river navigation on Jackson's river, 15 ms. above its confluence with the Cow Pasture, and directly opposite the termination of the Kanawha turnpike road. It contains besides the county buildings, 50 dwelling houses, and about the same number of mechanic shops. The buildings are principally of brick, and in some of them much taste is displayed; 2 handsome and spacious houses of public worship are about being erected, (1 Presbyterian and 1 Methodist,) 1 English and Classical school, and 3 mercantile stores. The mechanics are tanners, saddlers, boot and shoe makers, hatters, tailors, gunsmiths, house carpenters, cabinet makers, wagon makers, copper smiths, chair makers, blacksmiths and last makers. Its situation is handsome and eligible, on one of the greatest thoroughfares in Virginia, as travellers from E. to W. pass through this place to the Virginia Springs, it being nearly equi-distant from several, viz:—20 ms. from the White Sulphur, 22 from the Sweet Springs, 25 from the Hot Springs, 27 from the Warm Springs and 45 from the Salt Sulphur. Should the contemplated James and Kanawha improvements be carried into operation, Covington may become one of the most flourishing inland towns in Virginia, as it will probably be the place of depot between the land and water communication; and it likewise will command the trade of a large and fertile region of country, which abounds in all the products of the earth; and the mountains, of which abound in iron, and present sufficient water power, to force any quantity of machinery. Its situation is healthy, being located in the midst of the mountains. Property in this place has lately advanced 25 per cent in anticipation of the contemplated improvement. Population about 300 persons, of which 3 are attorneys, and 2 regular physicians. County Courts are held on the 3d Monday in every month. Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Taylor holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 18th of April and September. Jackson River, P. O. 178 ms. N. of R. and 221 S. W. by W. of W. Morris Hill, P. O. 184 ms. W. of R. and 227 from W. AUGUSTA. Augusta county was originally a portion of Orange county and continued so, until it became sufficiently populous to claim the rights of a separate, independent county, which rank was given to it in 1738. The first court after it was laid off from Orange was held in Staunton, in the year 1745, and its jurisdiction extended from the summit of the Blue Ridge to the Ohio river, including the present state of Kentucky, and from the James river to Frederick. As the population increased, it became necessary to divide this immense tract into various counties, at different times, until it assumed its present shape and size in the year 1790. The summit of the Blue Ridge forms the eastern boundary, until it strikes the line of Rockbridge, the line then runs a straight course in a N. E. direction, crossing the North mountain, until it reaches the summit of Walker's mountain, following this and the Cow Pasture mountain in a N. W. course, it strikes the corner of Rockingham, and runs thence in a S. W. direction, a straight course to the Blue Ridge. The length of Augusta county is about 34 ms.; the breadth 35,—and its area about 348 sq. ms. extending entirely across the Valley. The surface is generally uneven,—in many places hilly; and in some instances it rises into eminences that deserve the name of mountains. Towards the northern boundary, however, it spreads out into more extensive bottoms of very rich and fertile land. The soil is best adapted to agriculture and grazing. Large quantities of grain are raised for exportation, and there are within the county, 17 merchant mills, which are almost exclusively employed in manufacturing flour for this purpose. Cattle are also exported in considerable numbers. Although this county is well watered and abounds in fine springs, there are no very large streams, from the fact, that it is the highest land in the Valley, and divides the head waters of the James and Shenandoah rivers. The great Calf Pasture river runs through nearly half of the county, and wends its way in a S. direction to the James river, while the north, middle and south rivers, (the last two of which run nearly through the whole extent of the county) meet near the northern boundary, and form the Shenandoah. Christian's and Lewis' creeks are branches of the Middle river, and Mossy creek of the N. These streams are all valuable, on account of numerous mill seats upon them, which are always abundantly supplied with water. The mineral treasures of this county, have been but partially developed. Very little interest has been felt on this subject, except so far as it has been quickened by a hope of gain. Iron ore beds have been known and profitably worked for many years; and there is at present a furnace for the manufacturing and casting of iron in active operation; Miller's Iron Works, near the northern boundary, at the foot of the North mountain. Anthracite coal has lately been found in the vicinity of the Augusta Springs, and along the North mountain. It contains a portion of sulphur, though it becomes more pure as the excavation progresses, and gives promise of affording an abundant supply of this valuable mineral. The predominant rock in this part of the Valley is lime rock, which in some places is sufficiently hard to be used as marble, though it is not worked as such. In connection with this rock may be found rhombic chrystals of carbonite of lime, and dog-tooth spar the latter rarely. In the vicinity of Staunton, a species of calcedony in great quantities is scattered about, some of which is very pure. Springs are very abundant in all parts of the county, some of which are mineral and highly medicinal. The Augusta Springs are valuable, as a resort for invalids, and are daily becoming more noted. They are 12 ms. N. W. of Staunton, situated in a delightful country. The water is strongly impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen, and are said by those who should be judges, to equal the celebrated springs of Harrowgate, in England. Besides the Augusta Springs there are two other Sulphur Springs in the county, both of which are equally strongly impregnated; but there are few, if any accommodations for visitors at either of them. One is on the Free turnpike leading from Staunton to the Warm Springs, 17 ms. from S.: the other on the old road, 18 ms. from Staunton. A Chalybeate Spring has recently been discovered very near the Augusta Springs, but it has never been analyzed. About 12 ms. S. W. from Staunton, is a large spring that ebbs and flows daily;—there are two similar springs in Bath. The whole of Augusta county is based upon lime rock,—and from the nature of that rock, necessarily contains many curious fissures, excavations and caverns. Only two of these, however, deserve a notice, Madison's and Weyer's cave's which are both situated in the same ridge, and are but 200 yards apart. Madison's cave has been described by Jefferson,* * We extract a portion of Mr. Jefferson's description which is referred to in the text, and give also some later information concerning Madison's Cave. "It is situated on the N. side of the Blue Ridge, near the intersection of the Rockingham and Augusta line, with the south fork, of the southern river of Shenandoah. It is in a hill of about 200 ft. perpendicular height, the ascent of which, on one side is so steep that you may pitch a biscuit from its summit into the river which washes its base. The entrance of the cave, is in this side, about two-thirds of the way up. It extends into the earth about 300 ft., branching into subordinate caverns, sometimes ascending a little, but more generally descending, and at length terminates in two different places, at basins of water of unknown extent, and which I should judge to be nearly on a level with the waters of the river; however, I do not think they are formed by refluent waters from that, because they are never turbid; because they do not rise and fall in correspondence with that, in times of flood and of drought; and because the water is always cool. It is as probably one of the many reservoirs with which the interior parts of the earth are supposed to abound, and which yield supplies to the fountains of water, distinguished from others only by its being accessible. The vault of this cave is of solid limestone, from 20 to 40 or 50 ft. high, through which water is continually percolating. This, trickling down the sides of the cave, has encrusted them over in the form of elegant drapery, and dripping from the top of the vaults generates on that, and on the base below, stalactites of a conical form, some of which have met and formed massive columns." Madison's Cave derives its name from the father of the late Bishop Madison, who resided near it, and who was equally famed for his hospitality, his practical wit, and his convivial disposition. It has been known 70 or 80 years, but is now little visited as a curiosity,—the earth in it, affords salt petre in proportion of from 2 to 4 pounds to the bushel,—2000 weight was manufactured here during the years 1813-4. The earth when brought out is at the mouth of the cave put into a plank gutter which conducts it to the bank of the river, at the bottom of the hill, where it is put into tubs or vats mixed with wood ashes—water is passed through it, and this is evaporated to salt by boiling. The lakes of water which are found at the extremity of the cave have been navigated by a boat, and thoroughly explored, since Mr. Jefferson wrote; they are 30 or 40 ft. deep, and are bounded on the furthest extremity by rocks so abrupt that a footing can no where be had. in his notes on Virginia, but Weyer's has been described and explored since that time, and is far more worthy of being immortalized. The length of this this stupendous Cavern in a straight course is 1650 ft., but the distance is more than doubled by following the various windings. There are numerous apartments, some of which are magnificent. One measures 257 ft. in length, from 10 to 20 in breadth, and 33 in height,—another is 153 ft. long, 15 wide, and 60 high, while a third reaches the height of 100 feet! Every part is studded with beautiful stalactites, that lead you almost to believe that you have descended into the jewelled fruit garden, where hung Alladin's lamp.† † Weyer's Cave is situated near the northern extremity of Augusta county, Va. 17 ms. N. E. of Staunton, on the eastern side of a ridge running nearly N. and S. parallel to the Blue Ridge, and somewhat more than a mile distant from it. The western declivity of this ridge is very gradual, and the visiter, as he approaches from that direction, little imagines from its appearance, that it embowels one of Nature's master pieces. The eastern declivity however, is quite precipitous and difficult of ascent. The Guide's house is situated on the northern extremity of this ridge, and is distant 800 yds. from the entrance of the cave. In going from the house to the cave, you pass the entrance of Madison's Cave, which is only 200 yds. from the other. Madiison's Cave was known and visited as a curiosity, long before the discovery of Weyer's, but it is now passed by and neglected, as unworthy of notice compared with its more imposing rival, although it has had the pen of a Jefferson to describe its beauties. The ascent from the bottom of the hill to the mouth of the cave is steep, but is rendered less fatiguing, by the zigzag course of the path, which is 120 yds. in length. It seems that about the year 1804, one Bernard Weyer ranged these hills, as a hunter, while pursuing his daily vocation, he found his match in a lawless Ground Hog, which not only eluded all his efforts but eventually succeeded in carrying off the traps, which had been set for his capture. Enraged at the loss of his traps he made an assault upon the domicile of the drepredator, with spade and mattock. A few moments labor brought him to the ante-chamber of this stupendous cavern, where he found his traps safely deposited. The entrance originally was small and difficult of access; but the enterprise of the proprietor, has obviated these inconveniences: it is now enclosed by a wooden wall, having a door in its centre, which admits you to the ante-chamber. At first it is about 10 ft. in height but after proceeding a few yards, in a S. W. direction, it becomes contracted to the space of 4 ft. square. At the distance of 24 ft. from the entrance,—descending at an angle of 19 degrees; you reach the Dragon's Room, so called from a stalactitic concretion, which the Nomenclator undoubtedly supposed to resemble that nondescript animal. Above the Dragon's room there is an opening of considerable beauty, but of small size, called the Devil's Gallery. Leaving this room, which is not very interesting, you proceed in a more southerly direction, to the entrance of Solomon's Temple, through a high but narrow pessage, 66 ft. in length, which is by no means difficult of access. Here you make a perpendicular descent of 13 ft. by means of substantial stairs securely fixed, and you find yourself in one of the finest rooms in the whole cave. It is irregular in shape, being 30 ft. long, and 45 broad, running nearly at right angles to the main course of the cave. As you raise your eyes, after descending the steps before mentioned they rest upon an elevated seat, surrounded by sparry incrustations, which sparkle beautifully in the light of your candles. This is not unaptly styled, Solomon's Throne. Every thing in this room, receives its name from the Wise Man, immediately to the left of the steps, as you descend, you will find his Meat-house; and at the eastern extremity of the room, is a beautiful pillar of white stalactite, somewhat defaced by the smoke of candles, called by his name, yet with strange inconsistency, an incrustation resembling falling water at the right of the steps, has obtained the name of the Falls of Niagara, Passing Solomon's Pillar, you enter another room, more irregular than the first, but still more beautiful; it would be impossible adequately to describe the magnificence of the roof. I shall therefore merely observe that it is thickly studded with beautiful stalactites, resembling in form and color, the roots of radishes, which have given the appellation of Radish Room to this delightful place. The main passage to the rest of the cavern, is immediately opposite to the entrance to Solomon's Temple, and you reach it by an ascent of 12 ft. to what is called the Porter's Lodge. From this place, pursuing the same course, you pass along a passage varying from 10 to 30 ft. in height, from 10 to 15 m. breadth, and 50 m. length, until you reach Barney's Hall which receives its name from the fancied resemblance of a prostrate stalactite, at the base of one that is upright, to old Commodore Barney, and the cannon that he used at the Bladensburgh races. Near the centre of the room, which is small and scarcely deserves the name an upright board points out to the visiter the main path of the cave, which runs to the right. Two passages run off to the left,—the first one to a large, irregular room called the Lawyer's Office, in which is a fine spring, of water or rather a reservoir where the droppings from the ceiling have collected,—the other, through a passage to what is called The Armory, from an incrustration that has received the name of Ajax's Shield. Between the Lawyer's Office and the Armory, and communicating with both, is another large, irregular apartment, which is named Weyer's Hall, after the original discoverer of the cave, who together with his dog, stands immortalized in one corner. Before we get bewildered and lost in this part of the cave, which is more intricate than any other, let us return to the guide-board in the centre of Barney's Hall, and pursue the route usually taken by visiters. Following the right hand opening mentioned above, which is rather low being not more than 5 ft. in height, you pass into the Twin Room, taking heed lest you fall into the Devil's Bake Oven, which yawns close by your feet. This room is small, and communicates directly with the Bannister Room, which is 59 ft. distant from the guide-board. The arch here suddenly expands, and becomes elevated to the height of 30 ft., and by dint of hard climbing you may return to the Porter's Lodge, through a passage directly over the one which you have just passed. There are many beauties in this upper passage. A descent of 39 ft. from the Twin Room, in a direction due west, brings you into the Tan Yard, which contains many beauties. The floor is irregular, in some places sinking into holes somewhat resembling tan-vats, which together with several hanging stalactites resembling hides, have given a name to this immense apartment. On the S. E. side of the room, immediately to the left of the main path, is a large opening which admits you at once into the Armory, already mentioned. Changing your course to the N. W. you leave the Tan Yard, by a rough, but not difficult ascent of 20 ft., at an angle of 18 degrees, into what may be considered as an elevated continuation of the same room, but which has been deservedly dignified with a distinct appellation. To your right, as you step upon level ground, you will observe a perpendicular wall of rock, rising with great regularity, if you strike upon it with your hand, it sends forth a deep, mellow sound, strongly resembling the tones of a Bass Drum, whence the room has received the name of the Drum Room. Upon a closer examination, this apparent wall will be found to be only a thin stalactitic partition, extending from the ceiling to the floor. There is nothing else of much interest, in this apartment, we will proceed to the more magnificent portions of the cavern. You leave the Drum Room by a flight of natural stairs, 7 ft. in perpendicular height. A large opening now presents itself, which expands to an extensive apartment, to reach which it is necessary to make a nearly perpendicular descent of 10 ft., by means of a substantial pair of stairs. This apartment is the far famed Ball Room. It is 100 ft. long, 36 wide, and about 25 high, running at right angles to the path by which you entered it. The general course of the room is from N. to S. but at the northern extremity there is a gradual ascent, bearing round to the E. until you reach a precipice of 20 or 30 ft., from which you can look down into the Tan Yard, having performed a complete circuit. Near the centre of the Ball Room, is a large, calcarious deposite, that has received the name of Paganini's Statue, from the circumstance that it furnishes a good position for the music, whenever balls are given in these submundane regions. The floor is sufficiently level to admit of dancing upon it, and it is not uncommon, to have balls here. The ladies are accommodated with a very convenient Dressing Room, the only opening to which, communicates directly with the Ball Room. You leave this room, by a gradual ascent of 42 ft. at the southern extremity, similar to the one already described at the other. This acclivity is called the Frenchman's Hill, from the following circumstance.—Some years since, a French gentleman visited this cave, accompanied only by the guide, they had safely gone through, and returning had reached the top of this hill, when by some accident both of their lights were extinguished, and they were left in Egyptian darkness, without the means of re-lighting their candles. Fortunately the Guide, from his accurate knowledge of localities, was enabled to conduct him safely to the entrance—a distance of more than 500 ft. Another gentleman, by the name of Patterson, has immortalized his name by attempting the same feat, although it was a complete failure. Hearing of the Frenchman's adventure, he undertook to find his way back to the entrance, from the Ball Room, without a light—sending his company come distance ahead. He succeeded in ascending the stairs, but had proceeded only a few paces farther, when his feet slipped from under him, and he was prostrated into an aperture, where he lay unhurt until his companions, alarmed at his protracted absence, returned for him. His resting place is called Patterson's Grave to this day. From the French Hill, a long, irregular passage extends, in a N. W. direction which is denominated the Narrow Passage. This passage is 52 ft. in length,—varying from 3 to 5 ft. in width,—and from 4 to 8 ft. in height. It leads you to the brink of a precipice, 12 ft. in height. Natural indentations in the face of this precipice, afford a convenient means of descent, and these natural steps have received the name of Jacob's Ladder. To correspond with this name, as in Solomon's Temple, every thing is named after the Patriarch; a flat rock opposite to the extremity of the Narrow Passage, is Jacob's Tea Table; and a deep, inaccessible perforation in the rock, by its side, is Jacob's Ice House! Descending the ladder you turn to the lett, and pass through a narrow opening, still continuing to descend though less perpendicularly, to the centre of a small apartment, called the Dungeon. The descent from the top of the Ladder to the place is 28 feet. This room communicates, by a passage about 4 ft. sq. with the Senate Chamber. A thin flat rock, stretches over nearly half of this apartment, which is only about 40 ft. in diameter, at the height of 8 or 10 ft. from the floor, forming a sort of Gallery, which doubtless caused the name already mentioned, to be given to the room. The Senate Chamber communicates by a high, broad opening, with a still larger apartment, denominated Congress Hall. This name must have been given, on account of its proximity to the last mentioned room, and not from any thing particularly appropriate in the room itself. It is long, and like the Ball Room, runs nearly at right angles to the main path,—its course being nearly N. and S. and a wall, having several openings, runs through its whole length. The main path winds to the left as you enter the room, but we will diverge a little to the right, and explore the dark recess that presents itself to view. The floor of Congress Hall is very uneven, and at the northern extremity rises somewhat abruptly. Climbing this ascent if you pass through one of the openings in the wall mentioned above, you will be able to see through the whole extent of the other half of the room, but it is impossible to traverse it, on occount of two or three deep pits, that occupy the whole space between the wall and the side of the room. Turning around to the right of the opening through which you passed, your eye vainly attempts to penetrate the deep, dark abyss that presents itself, and you hesitate to descend. Its name—The Infernal Regions, does not offer many inducements to enter it, and for many years, it has been supposed to contain fixed air, so that visiters avoid it, and it has never until recently, been thoroughly explored. Our course now lies to the S. W. up a perpendicular ascent of 17 ft., to what is called the Lobby. From this place, an expert climber, well acquainted with the cave, may pass through secret passages, and bye rooms, to the end of the cave, without once entering the main path, but we will pursue the accustomed route. You have ascended to the Lobby, only to descend again on the other side, after taking a few steps horizontally. A perpendicular descent of 17 ft., brings you to the most magnificent apartment in the whole cavern. This is Washington's Hall, so called in token of respect for the memory of our Country's Father, and it is worthy of bearing the name. Its length is 257 ft., its breadth from 10 to 20 ft., and its height about 33 ft. being remarkably level and straight, through the whole length. Not far from the centre of this room, is an immense deposite of calcarious matter rising to the height of 6 or 7 ft. which, very strikingly resembles a statue clothed in drapery. This is Washington's Statue, and few can look upon it—as seen by the dim light of two or three candles which rather stimulate than repress curiosity, without experiencing a sensation of awe and solemnity, as if they were actually in the presence of the mighty dead. A few yards from the entrance, another room branches off to the left, to reach which you must ascend a bank of 5 or 6 ft. in height. This is called the Theatre, from the fact that different parts of the room correspond to the Gallery, Stage and Pit. I have said that the breadth of Washington's Hall was from 10 to 20 ft.; this must be understood only of the lower part of the room, for the arch stretches over a rock 20 ft. high, which forms the left wall, and embraces another room called Lady Washington's Hall. The entrance to this apartment, is opposite to the Statue, and is on the same level with the Hall. The wall that separates the two rooms, is several feet thick, and has received the strange name of The Rock of Gibralter. You leave this splendid apartment, at the S. W. extremity, by a rough, narrow but high passage, running at the foot of the Pyramids of Egypt and Cleopatra's Needle! At the end of this passage, in a recess at the right, is another Spring or reservoir, not as large as the one in the Lawyer's Office. A descent of 8 or 10 ft. brings you into the Diamond Room, which may be considered as forming a part of The Church, a long, irregular room, more lofty than any that we have yet entered. Its length is 152 feet, its breadth from 10 to 15, and its height 50! At the farthest extremity, a beautiful white spire shoots up to a considerable height, which is appropriately styled. The Steeple, and has, no doubt, suggested the name of the room. Nearly opposite to the centre of the Church, is a recess, raised several ft. of considerable extent. This forms a very good Gallery to the Church. Immediately in the rear of the Gallery, and in full view from below, is a great number of pendant stalactites, of several ft. in length, and of various sizes ranged like the pipes of an organ, and beara striking resemblance to them. If these stalactites are struck by any hard substance, they send forth sounds of various pitches, according to their size, and a stick run rapidly along several of them at once, produces, a very pleasing variety of sounds. With great propriety this is called The Organ. Passing under the Steeple, which rests on an arch elevated not more than 10 feet, you enter the Dining Room. This room is named from a long natural table, that stands on the left side, and is not quite as large as the Church, though its height is 60 ft. Was it not for the kind of wall which the Steeple makes, it might be considered as a continuation of the Church, and its length is therefore included in that of the Church. A little to the left of the table is a small uninviting opening. Proceeding only a few paces through the opening, you suddenly find yourself in an immense Chamber, stretching from the Gallery of the Church with which it communicates, parallel to the Dining Room, to its utmost extremity, and proportionably wide. This is called Jackson's Room, and the floor is very irregular. This room is rather uninteresting, but it leads to one that deserves a passing notice. Directly opposite the little passage which conducted you hither, is a large opening, passing this, the rocks contract until only a narrow pass is left, a few feet in length. This conducts you, if not to the most magnificent, at least to the most beautiful and interesting portion of the whole cavern. There is but one apartment and that is small, but The Garden of Eden, for so it is called, derives its beauty from the singular arrangement of the immense stalactites, hanging from the roof, and meeting the stalagmites, which have ascended from the floor to meet them, or in few words, it seems as if at some former period a sheet of water had poured down from the roof and by some wonderful operation of Nature, had become suddenly petrified. This sheet is not continuous, but strongly resembles the folds of heavy drapery, and you may pass among the windings as through the mazes of a labyrinth, and the light of a candle shines distinctly through any part of it. A portion of the floor of this room, is composed of a beautiful, fine yellow sand, whereas most of the cave is a stiff clay, with very few indications of sand. Returning to the Dining Room, the next room, or perhaps it should be called passage, is denominated The Wilderness, from the roughness of the path-way, and is only 10 ft. wide, but it rises to the immense height of 90 or 100 feet! As we come along the Causeway, and look down upon our right, we shall see our company 40 to 50 ft. below us, while our eyes can scarcely penetrate through the darkness, to the ceiling above their heads. Upon the very verge of the rock upon which we are standing, are several beautiful white stalagmites, grouped together, among which, one stands pre-eminent. This is Bonaparte with his Body Guard, crossing the Alps. The effect is peculiarly fine, when viewed from below. Proceeding only a few paces from the Emperor you find yourself upon an arch, under which your company are passing, which is very appropriately called The Natural Bridge. You are now upon the lowest level of the cave, and at the entrance of the farthest room. This is Jefferson's Hall, an extensive, but not very elevated apartment, quite level. Before I describe this room, we must diverge a little, and visit one or two rooms, that branch off from the main path. Directly to your right, as you emerge from the Wilderness, there rises an immense mass, apparently of solid stalagmite, 36 ft. in length, 30 ft. in breadth, and 30 ft. in height; this mass is beautiful beyond description, very much resembling successive stories, and is called The Tower of Babell. The most splendid portion of the Tower, is on the back, but it is difficult of access, for it is necessary to climb up the surface of the rock to the height of 15 or 20 ft. the view however, amply repays you for the labor. For a few moments, you can scarcely convince yourself that an immense body of water is not pouring over the precipice in a foaming cataract, so white, so dazzling is the effulgence of the rock; and when this impression is effaced the words of the pious Bard rush into the mind, where he describes the awful effects that will follow the consummation of all things, "The Cataract, that like a Giant wroth, Rushed down impetuously, as seized at once By sudden frost, with all his hoary locks, Stood still!! One might almost imagine, that Pollok had visited this wonder, and caught the idea so forcibly expressed above, from viewing this magnificent scene. We have already so much exceeded our intended limits, that we can only look into the large apartment, that occupies the space behind the Tower, which is called Sir Walter Scott'r Room, and then hasten pack to the main path. Jefferson's Room, that we left some time since, is very irregular in shape, and is 235 ft. long, following the various windings. What is commonly called the end of the cave, is distinguished by two singular, thin, lamellar rocks, 5 or 6 feet in diameter united at their bases, but spreading out so that the outer edges are several feet apart, this is called The Fly Trap! To the left of the Fly Trap, is a large recess, where is a fine spring, at which the weary visiter is glad to slake his thirst, after the fatigues of his arduous undertaking. A few yards beyond the Fly Trap, there is an opening on the solid wall, at the height of about 12 ft. through which you are admitted by a temporary ladder. By hard climbing you soon penetrate to the end of the recess, where you will find the Source of the Nile! This is a beautiful, limped Spring covered over with a thin pellicle of stalagmite, yet sufficiently strong to bear your weight,—in this crust there is a perforation that gives you access to the water beneath. At all seasons, the air of the cave is damp, but the dampness of the floor depends much upon the seasons, if you except a moist place near the Fly Trap, there is no standing water throughout all the cavern, so that no difficulty on that account occurs. The temperature remains invariably in all parts, at about 56 degrees of Farenheit, from which it follows, that if the cave is visited in the winter, its air feels quite warm; but if in summer, a proportionable degree of cold is experienced. The spring and fall are the best times for visiting, for then the atmosphere without, is nearly of the same temperature with that within the cave, and it is more dry at these times. *The Cyclopean Towers.—On a fine morning in September 1834, a party of which the writer was one, consisting for the most part of gentlemen who had met together in the town of Staunton from various sections of the Union, resolved on a visit to certain remarkable NATURAL STRUCTURES which lay in the neighborhood of the Augusta Springs, and about twenty miles distant from the place of their departure. After passing over a hilly and picturesque country, the road opened upon a fertile valley, which though in places narrow, was of considerable length,—and when seen from an elevated position, appeared like the bed of an ancient lake, or as it really is, the alluvial border of a flowing stream. The strata of limestone hills, followed their usual order of parallel lines to the great mountains of our continent, as though a strong current had once swept through this magnificent valley, forming in its course islands and promontories, which are now discoverable in numerous short hills and rocky bluffs, that are either naked and barren, or covered with a growth of stately trees. It was at such a projection, that we first described the gray summits of what seemed a ruinous castle,—resembling those which were raised in feudal times to guard the passes of the Rhine, or like such as are still seen in mouldering majesty, on many an Alpine rock. These summits or towers, of which there are seven, lifted their heads above the lofty clms, like so many antique chimnies in the midst of a grove, but, on approaching them nearer, our pleasure was greatly increased, to find them rise almost perpendicularly from the bed of a small stream, which winding around their base, serves as a natural moat to a building not made with mortal hands. The southern front of this colossal pile, presents a wall of about sixty feet elevation, terminating in three towers of irregular height, and perforated at its base by a cavern,—which, by an apt association, was denominated "Vulcan's Forge." The tower on the extreme right, was unanimously called "Cooke's Tower"—in honor of one of our party who ascended it. On the left, are two other isolated towers,—of which the centre or smaller one was distinguished as the "Hymcnial Altar,"—a name which had its origin partly in a jeu d'esprit, and partly on account of a shady bower in its rear, which seemed an appropriate shade to mantle maiden's blushes. The furthest and tallest, received the title of the "Touer of Babol." This is also the most perpendicular of all these rocky structures; an archway passes through it, by which there is an easy ascent to the remaining two, which stand on the acchvity of the hill,—and though of less altitude, are not of inferior beauty to the rest. One of them, which is of a round form, and flat at the top, and on that account received the appellation of the "Table Rock"—affords from its summit a splendid view of the whole, the other, and last of the five, we distinguished as "Shelton's Rock"—from one of our party. These rocks in their formation resemble the palisades on the Hudson river—but are more regular in their strata,—which appear to have been arranged in huge masses of perfect workmanship—with projections like cornices of Gothie architecture, in a state of dilapidation. Those who are acquainted with the structure of the Cyclopean walls of the ancients, would be struck with the resemblance,—which suggested the name at the head of this article. We pause to inquire why these primeval fragments of the world have remained so long unnoticed! Why is it that men are so easily awakened to the liveliest interest in distant objects, and yet neglect those which are nearer and more accessible? "A prophet" it hath been said on high authority, "hath honor save in his own country," and to that strange propensity of the mind to contemn whatever is familiar, must be attributed the neglect of many of the richest treasures at our own door, which frequently impart both wealth and distinction to foreign enterprise. For many years these towers have been known in the surrounding country, by the homely appellation of "The Chimneys,"—but no one has ever stopped to examine them, or to inquire how nature formed so curious a pile in such a spot. Imagination may indeed conceive that this noble structure was once the Scylla of a narrow strait connecting the waters of the N. and the S. until their accumulated pressure burst through the Blue Ridge at Harper's Ferry, and left in their subsidence these towers, as a perpetual memorial of their former dominion. Population in 1820, 16,742—1830, 19,926. Augusta belongs to the 12th judicial circuit and 6th district. Tax paid in 1833, $6659 24— in 1834 on lots, $470 80—on land, $4,343 09—2,443 slaves, $610 75— 9,360 horses, $561 60—48 studs, $421 00—78 coaches, $187 85—1 stage, $3 00—carryalls, $69 95—58 gigs, $39 15. Total, $6,717 19. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $883 59—in 1833, $963 74. 40 TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Augusta Springs, P. O. 17 ms. N. N. W. of Staunton, 134 ms. N.

W. by W. of R. and 40 a little N. of W. from Charlottesville; situated in lat. 38° 9′ N. and in long. 2° 03′ W. of W., on one of the extreme head branches of the E. fork of Shenandoah river. It stands on the fine valley between the Blue Ridge and Kittatinny, or between the Blue Ridge and North mountain chains, a little N. of Madison and Weyer's cave. With the exception of Winchester, Staunton is the oldest town W. of the Blue Ridge. Sometime previous to the laying off of Augusta from Orange, a grant of 120,000 acres of land was made to Wm. Beverly, Esq. comprising the greater part of the present county. Beverly gave to the county when it was formed 25 acres, situated upon Lewis' creek, on which to build a C. H. and found a county town. Here the first court was held in 1745, and this was the beginning of Staunton. It was not legally recognized as a town until 1761. The grant of Beverly was divided off into lots by the county, and soon became settled; more being required, Beverly caused several lots to be surveyed, adjoining this grant, which survey bears the date of 1749, and shows the early increase of the place. Staunton originally occupied only the level land upon the borders of the creek, but it has become gradually extended, until it has surmounted the surrounding hills, and now resembles an amphitheatre in form. The streets are quite regular, running at right angles, and have specific names, but like many other old towns, they are too narrow. This probably arises from the necessity that existed when they were founded, of living as compactly as possible, that the inhabitants might more easily repel the incursions of a savage enemy, who dwelt in the surrounding forests and mountains. It became a corporate borough in 1801, having a mayor, 6 aldermen and 4 common council men. At present it contains about 200 dwelling houses, exclusive of stores, shops, offices, &amp;c. and its population, according to the census of 1830, is 2,000. There are 13 dry good stores, 1 book store, 1 druggist's store, 1 confectioner, 4 groceries, 2 carriage makers, 2 wagon makers, 2 saddlers, 7 blacksmiths, 3 tanyards, 3 hatters, 2 chair makers, 4 tinners, 1 copper smith, 1 gun smith, 1 threshing machine maker, 3 cabinet makers, 2 watch makers, 1 pottery and 5 tailors, besides the various other trades usually followed in a place of this size. There is 1 printing office, from which issues a valuable weekly paper; and which is occasionally engaged in the publication of books and pamphlets. There are also 12 attorneys, 6 regular physicians, and 3 ministers of the gospel. The churches at which these ministers officiate belong to the Presbyterian, Episcopalian and Methodist denominations, and are all handsome brick buildings. The public edifices are a C. H.* * Since this was written, the court has contracted for the erection of a new C. H. which will be unquestionably the finest building of the kind in any county in the state. and jail, built of stone, a Chancery C. H., a county clerk's office, and a market house, all built of brick, and there are also 4 extensive hotels. Much attention is paid to education in this place, and many young persons of both sexes, are sent here from all parts of the country, to attend the various schools. There are 2 female seminaries, and a male academy; all of which employ respectively several teachers, and are in a flourishing condition, besides 4 primary schools. The Western Lunatic Hospital is located in Staunton, and is a noble pile of buildings, it is sufficiently commodious to accommodate 37 lunatics, but is at the present time, being enlarged, by the addition of two extensive wings, which, when completed, will accommodate 40 more. An act has passed the General Assembly, authorising the establishment also, of a Deaf and Dumb Asylum as soon as funds can be procured for that purpose. Lewis' creek runs through the centre of the town, and has sufficient fall to turn a chopping mill, a grist mill and a carding machine. There is still sufficient unemployed water power to drive a cotton or woollen factory of considerable extent, and an enterprising capitalist might profitably invest some portion of his capital in that business. County Courts are held on the 4th Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, May, August and October. Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery are held on the 10th of June and November, by Judge Thompson. Steel's Tavern, P. O. 138 ms. from R. and 180 from W. Waynesboro' P. V. 109 ms. from R. and 150 from W., situated at the western foot of the Blue Ridge, on South river. Waynesboro' is an industrious and wealthy little village, located in a beautiful and picturesque situation, in a fertile and well watered country, on the main stage road leading from Charlottesville to Staunton, 30 ms. N. W. of the former, and 12 E. S. E. of the latter. The present town is called Waynesboro', junior, (Waynesboro', senior, lying a little N. having fallen into ruins.) It contains 70 dwelling houses, 5 mercantile stores, 2 houses of public worship, (1 Methodist and 1 Presbyterian,) 1 incorporated academy, 1 common school and public library, 1 extensive manufacturing flour mill and a wool carding machine, 1 hotel (kept in the best style,) 2 tanyards, 2 saddlers, 3 tailors, 1 hatter, 1 silver smith and watch maker, 1 wagon maker, 1 chair maker, 2 cabinet makers, 3 boot and shoe factories, and 3 blacksmith's shops. Population not less than 500 persons; of whom 4 are regular physicians. BATH. Bath County was created by the Legislature in 1791 from a portion of Augusta, Bottetourt and Greenbrier. It is bounded by Augusta on the E. —Rockbridge on the S. E.—Alleghany on the S. and S. W.—Greenbrier on the W.—Pocahontas on the N. W., and Pendleton on the N. Its extent, from a ridge of the North mountain on the S. E., to the main Alleghany ridge on the N. W. is 25 miles, and from Pendleton on the N. E. to Alleghany on the S. W. 40 miles; and area 756 square miles. Extending in lat. from 37° 50′ to 38° 25′ N. and in long 2° 18′ to 3° W. of W. C. The face of the country is very broken and in great part mountainous, being situated at the eastern base of the great Alleghany ridge: about one-eighth of it may be considered arable land, the mean elevation of which is 1200 feet above the ocean. It is well watered by Jackson's river, and its tributary, Back creek, (the latter washing the base of the Alleghany mountain,) and by the Cow Pasture river, and its tributary, the Bull Pasture, all of which have their sources in Pendleton county. Jackson river and the Cow Pasture, afterwards forming a junction in Bottetourt county, their united stream is styled James river. Into these streams descend from the mountains numerous branches and rivulets,* * Among these, Falling Spring Creek deserves notice. It rises in the Warm Spring mountains about 20 miles S. W. of the Warm Springs, and flows into that valley. About three-quarters of a mile from its source, it falls over a rock 200 feet into the valley below. The sheet of water is broken in its breadth by the rock in two or three places, but not at all in its height.—Between the sheet and rock at the bottom one may walk across dry. This cataract will bear no comparison with that of Niagara as to the quantity of water eomposing it—the sheet being only 12 or 15 feet wide above, and somewhat more below, but it is half as high again. The latter being only 156 feet according the mensuration made by order of Mons. Vaudreuil, Governor of Canada, and 130 according to a mere recent account. affording innumerable sites for mills and machinery. Each of those streams are separated by a mountain running parallel thereto, none of which are considerable or known by any name, beyond the limits of the county, except Jackson's or the Warm Spring mountain. They are not remarkable for their height, and excepting the one already mentioned do not exceed from 300 to 500 feet from their base, and are by no means sterile the soil on them being tolerably good, and neither too rocky or too steep for tillage; producing the most valuable kinds of timber, an extraordinary variety of shrubbery and herbage, and abounding in limestone, iron ore, and springs of excellent water. But it is as a grazing ground that they are chiefly valuable. Large herds of cattle, ranging on them in the summer months. The vallies between the mountains, which are from 2 to 5 miles wide, are very fertile, a considerable portion entirely level, and in a fine state of cultivation, producing abundant crops of grain and hay. The average produce per acre, being as follows, to wit wheat and rye 20 to 30 bushels; Indian corn 25 to 40; oats 20 to 30; buckwheat, and barley 25, potatoes and turnips 100 bushels, flax, 200 lbs.; hemp 800 lbs.; and hay one to two tons. The meadows are particularly fine, and the kinds of grass cultivated are, timothy, clover, and blue grass, all of which flourish exceedingly. A soil so well adapted to grain and grass, naturally induced the proprietors to turn their attention to live stock. Accordingly, horses, mules, cattle, (of the finest breeds) sheep and hogs are raised, and a considerable number of them annually driven to market. Connected with the management of live stock, is the dairy, which is here well understood Large quantities of butter are made and sent to market. Wool also is an article of which the quantity made is greater than the consumption, and is increasing. Out of the flax and wool which they grow, the inhabitants of this county manufacture all the clothing worn by themselves and the 41 slaves on their farms. The soil and climate are particularly favorable to fruit trees, and produce, apples and peaches in great abundance; every farm having an orchard. Gardening is also practised to an extent equal to the demand for family use. In a section of country so much diversified with mountains and vallies, abounding with mineral and other springs, pure air, and a temperate climate, health and longevity may be expected. This is actually the case, and in this respect it is not surpassed by any part of the United States. In this county there are 2 attorneys, 2 physicians, 4 stores, 3 merchantmills, 18 grist mills, 16 saw mills, 4 carding machines, 3 tan yards, 2 tilt-hammers, and 1 distillery. Population in 1820, 5,237—in 1830, 4,002. Bath belongs to the 17th judicial circuit, and 9th district. Tax paid in 1833, $837 24—in 1834, on lots, 86 cts.—on land, $468 69—634 slaves, $158 50—2,117 horses, $127 02—10 studs, $73 00—6 coaches, $14 00—5 carryalls, $5 00—2 gigs, $1 00—Total, $848 07. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $142 53—in 1833, $203 75. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c Bull Pasture, P. O. 164 miles from R. and 206 from W. This is the local name given to the higher part of Cow Pasture river, or the middle constituent of the James. It rises in Pendleton and flows S. 20° W. to its confluence with the Cow Pasture in Bath. It is about 20 ms. in length, 10 of which distance is in each of the two counties. In that portion of the Bull Pasture valley, which lies in Bath, there are located 37 dwelling houses, 1 Presbyterian house of worship, 1 school, 1 mercantile store, a saddler, tailor, tilt-hammer, and manufacturing mill; and a population of about 370 persons. The principal occupation of the inhabitants is agriculture. In this neighborhood there is a large spring of limestone water, to which no bottom has as yet been found. It rises between two large rocks, from under a bank covered with spruce pine, and is called the Blue Spring. After running about 40 yards, it discharges itself into the Bull Pasture, on the west side, about 3 ms. from its junction with the Cow Pasture. On that part of the Bull Pasture, which lies beyond the Bath and Pendleton line, are situated 63 dwelling houses, 2 houses of public worship (1 Methodist, and the other free for all denominations,) 1 mercantile store, 1 tanyard, and various mechanics; the whole population is 630 persons, one of whom is a physicians. Flowing Spring, P. O. 206 ms. S. W. of W. and 164 N. W. of R., situated in the valley of the Cow Pasture, 16 ms. N. E. of the Warm Springs. There is no town or village at the place, and the spring is private property. This spring intermits, or ebbs and flows, affording when the tide is up, sufficient water for a grist mill, and when it ebbs, leaves a stream large enough for the supply of a distillery and a tanyard. The water is of the purest and best quality, equal in temperature to ice water. In the dryest weather in summer, the water flows out in a bold and majestic stream, that astonishes those who have witnessed the spring which is left after it falls away. When the flowing commences, the water comes in a body as if let loose from a dam. Issuing from the rocks at the foot of a hill, it continues to run for ten or twelve hours, then gradually declines. There is no regularity in the flowing, in the same kind of weather it will vary from two to three days,— sometimes flowing every day—at other times at intervals of two or three days. Neither is there any particular period of time at which the water rises. This irregularity has created the greatest difficulty in accounting for it. A mill, a distillery, and tanyard are supplied with water from this spring. Green Valley, P. O. 157 ms. N. W. by W. of R. and 199 S. W. by W. of W., situated on Stewart's creek, a branch of the Cow Pasture river, 12 ms. E. of the Warm Springs, on the main post road. Hot Springs, P. O. 217 ms. S. W. by W. of W. and 175 N. W. by W. of R.—situated between the Cow Pasture and the eastern branch of Jackson's river, at the base of a lofty mountain of the same name, 5 ms. S. S. W. of the Warm Springs, and 57 S. W. by W. of Staunton, on the main post road leading from Richmond to Guyandotte on the Ohio. These springs are numerous, probably amounting to twenty, issuing from the hill upon which the hotel is situated, and all varying in their temperature, presenting every variety, from 51° to 107°. As yet however there have been only three baths constructed. One called the hot bath or boiler, over which there has been erected a large and handsome building, containing fifteen rooms; a portion of which together with one-half of the Bath, is appropriated exclusively to ladies, and the residue with the other half of the bath to gentlemen. The second bath is called the Spout, from a pipe of water of the temperature of 106°, which falls into the body of the bath, from a height of 7 or 8 feet from its bottom. The third is called the Temperate Bath. Its temperature always corresponding with that of the blood of the human system; over this spring is now in progress of erection an octagonal house, nearly 120 feet in the clear, with convenient dressing rooms attached. The accommodations though considerably improved in the last two years, are still very defective. The property, however has been recently purchased by Dr. Goode, who has commenced its improvement on an extensive scale, and will probably in the course of two years have a sufficient number of buildings erected to accommodate all who are desirous of obtaining relief from the waters. These waters are principally celebrated for their efficacy in cutaneous, rheumatic, dyspeptic, and liver affections. They are however resorted to for every species of disease, and perhaps there is none in which one or the other of the baths have not proved beneficial. There are no local improvements at the Hot Springs, excepting those mentioned. The country around to a considerable extent being the property of an individual, it has prevented the settlement of mechanics, merchants, or professional men. The proprietor, Dr. Goode, is himself an eminent physician. Three miles S. W. of the Hot Springs, are situated what are called the Healing Springs. They have not yet come fully into notice, but have of late met with considerable attention, and it is confidently believed by those who are acquainted with the efficacy of their waters, to be the best in the United States. They consist of several small warm springs. They have never been analized, but have performed some very extraordinary cures where the other mineral springs have failed. Milboro' Spring, P. V. 157 ms. from R. and 199 S. W. by W. of W. Milboro' is a small village situated on the free turnpike road, leading from Staunton, through Panther's Gap, to the Warm Springs,—6 ms. W. of the Gap, 13 E. of the Springs, 22 N. W. of Lexington, and 1½ from Cow Pasture river, which is navigable from this point by boats for three months in the year. It contains 25 buildings, several of which are of brick, a mercantile store, tavern, manufacturing flour mill, blacksmith and tilt-hammer shop, (on an extensive scale,) 1 wagon maker, and 1 hatter. The situation of this village is pleasant and eligible,—near a sulphur spring, which has been famed for the medicinal qualities of its waters, and was formerly much frequented. This is a place of considerable business, being located in a thickly settled neighborhood, surrounded by handsome and fertile farms, producing all kinds of grain and stock. One mile from this village, on the right hand side of the turnpike leading to the Warm Springs, is situated the Blowing Cave. Near the north bank of the Cow Pasture river, between the cave and Milboro', stands a house of public worship, called the Wind Cave Meeting House, which is free for all denominations. A turnpike road is being made from this place to Lexington, a considerable portion of which is already in operation. Ruckmanville, P. O. 180 ms. from R. and 222 S. W. by W. from W. Ruckmanville, though called a village, is simply a post office, established in 1827, and called after the proprietor of the place, who resides here and keeps a house of entertainment. It is situated 27 ms. N. of the Warm Springs, on the main post road leading from Franklin to Huntersville, and 25 ms. from the mouth of Back creek. This creek rises in Pendleton county, and after running 40 or 50 ms. along the eastern base of the Alleghany mountain empties into Jackson's river, a branch of the James. Its principal branches are the Valley branch, which intersects the same at Ruckmanville, and Little Back creek about 20 miles below at Gateswood.—The surrounding country is mountainous. The upland is uneven, but the soil is good, producing in abundance, grass, corn, wheat, rye, oats, potatoes, buckwheat, flax, &amp;c. The timber is, sugar maple, chesnut, beech, various kinds of oak, sycamore, locust, hickory and walnut. The neighborhood is thickly settled with industrious and wealthy farmers. WARM SPRINGS, P. V. and seat of justice, 170 ms. N. W. of R. and 212 S. W. of W. This village is situated in a narrow valley, between two high mountains, which run parallel from N. E. to S. W. The view from many points of these mountains is grand and picturesque in the extreme. The beauty and grandeur of the scene from the Warm Spring Rock, has become very celebrated; but must be seen to be appreciated. This village contains besides the ordinary county buildings, about 14 dwelling houses, 2 mercantile stores, 1 saddler, 2 tailors, and 3 blacksmiths. The ordinary population, consists of about 137 persons, of whom 1 is a physiciam. The accommodations for visiters to the waters are also very extensive, consisting of about five and twenty cabins, most of which are of brick, besides the new Thermal Hotel, which has lately been erected, at great cost to the proprietors, and which is a large brick building, about 135 feet long, containing a dining room for 200 persons, a drawing room, a ball room, and about five and twenty comfortable chambers. The front is adorned by a large portico, the whole length of the house, supported by fourteen Doric columns, which affords an agreeable shade during the heat of the day, and a fine promenade, as well for the invalid, as for the beaux and belles. Any one who has ever taken the bath here will never forget its luxury, and to those who have not, it is impossible to convey a just idea of the delicious sensations it causes. It is much to be regretted, that all our valuable mineral waters have not been faithfully analysed. Thousands of our citizens annually resort to the watering-places west of the Blue Ridge, for the purpose of preserving or repairing health. The climate in the autumnal months cannot be surpassed for salubrity, and very many invalids are relieved from pain and sickness by the united power of air and water. In Europe, no one thinks of using waters whose contents are not accurately ascertained by men of science; but unfortunately in our country, copious libations are made, before it is known whether the quality of the water is adapted to the particular case or not. A careful analysis of the water at the Warm Springs has been obligingly furnished to the proprietors by a distinguished Professor of Chemistry, (Mr. Rogers, of William and Mary,) and the result is as follows: "Contents of the Waters of the Bath, at the Warm Springs, as ascertained by Chemical Analysis: "The bath is an Octagon 38 ft. in diameter, and 16 ft. 9 in inside—its area is 1163 77 ft. "The ordinary depth of water being 5 ft. the cubic capacity is 5818 86 ft. or 43533 32 gallons. Notwithstanding the leaks, this quantity of water will flow into the Reservoir, in one hour. "The average temperature of the Bath is 98 deg. Fahrenheit. The Gas, which rises in the Bath, consists of Nitrogen, with minute quanties of Sulphuretted Hydrogen and Carbonic Acid. "Besides this Gas, each gallon of water contains 45 cubic inches of Gas, consisting of Nitrogen 3.25 cub in Sulphuretted Hydrogen 0.25 cub in Carbonic Acid 1.00 cub in "The Saline contents of one gallon of the water, are as follows: Muriate of Lime 3.968 Sulphate of Magnesia 9.984 Carbonate of Lime 4.288 Sulphate of Lime 5.466 A trace of Soda, no doubt, in the state of Muriate, 23.706" From this account, which may be implicitly relied on, it appears that while the Warm Springs afford the most luxurious bath in the world, they contain neutral salts and various gases, which act as a gentle aperient, diuretic and sudorific, and give tone and vigor to the human system. It is well ascertained in other countries, that waters of a high temperature tend more to strengthen the digestive organs than those of a low temperature; but it is found, by actual experiment, that the water at the Warm Springs retains a considerable portion of its useful qualities when bottled in the Spring, and then cooled by immersing the bottles in cold water or even ice, and this plan is adopted by many of those who have a repugnance to the use of warm water. County Courts are held on the 2d Monday in every month.—Quarterly in March, June, August and Nevember. Judge Taylor, holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 25th of April and September. Willsonville, P. O. 178 ms. N. W. by W. of R. and 220 S. W. by W. of W., situated in the south western part of the county. Willsonville is the name of a farm at which the P. O. is located, and which contains more than 1200 acres, 400 of which are level and in good cultivation, producing well, wheat, rye, oats, corn, buckwheat, &amp;c., and the dairy produces per annum from 12 to 1500 wt. of butter. There is also a blacksmith's shop, grist and saw mill in the centre of the farm; the latter moved by water of Jackson's river. As a farm, this will bear comparison with any in the Valley of Virginia. It is 20 ms. from the Warm Springs, and 35 from Franklin, (the county seat of Pendleton,) between which places the road is entirely level, and runs along the vallies of Jackson's river, and South Branch of Potomac. A weekly mail arrives here on every Monday. BERKLEY. Berkley was created in 1772, from a portion of the county of Frederick. It is bounded by Jefferson E. and S. E.—Frederick S. and S. W.— Morgan W. and N. W.—and by the Potomac, separating it from Washington county, Maryland, N. and N. E. Its mean length is 22½ miles, mean breadth 13; and area 308 sq. ms. It extends in lat. from 39° 14′ to 39° 45′ N. and long from 1° 14′ to 2° 11′ W. of W. C. Back and Opequhan creeks run through this county in nearly parallel directions, and near the borders of the county, in a northeasterly direction, and give the general slope of the county their own direction. The surface of this county is much broken, and very mountainous, the arable surface of the farms has a mean elevation of from 5 to to 700 feet above tide water. Anthracite coal has lately been discovered in the western section of this county of a very superior quality, and in great abundance. The valley in which it is found is a continuation of the valley which produces such large quantities in Pensylvania, and the proximity of the mine to the Chesapeake and Ohio canals will afford the facilities of a ready transportation to market. This discovery if it should prove as successful as there is every reason to anticipate, will convert a region heretofore barren and almost without a single inhabitant, into an inexhaustible source of private and public wealth—multiplying the inhabitants, extending the comfort of individuals and adding to the permanent revenue of the State. Population in 1810, 11,479,—in 1820, 11,211—in 1830, 10,528. This county belongs to the 13th judicial circuit and 7th district. Tax paid in 1833, $3401 46—in 1834, on lots, $238 79—land, $2194 90—975 slaves, $242 75—4369 horses, $264 19—20 studs, $162 00—65 coaches, $143 65—11 carryalls, $11 60—12 gigs, $11 05. Total, $3267 48. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $854 18—in 1833, $570 09. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Berlington Mills, P. O. recently located. Darksville, P. V. 165 ms. from R. and 86 from W., situated on Sulphur Spring creek, a branch of Opequhan, 25 ms. N. W. of Harper's Ferry, and on the post road leading from Martinsburg to Winchester, 7 ms. from the former and 15 from the latter, near a beautiful stream called Middle Creek. The soil in the vicinity is very fertile and principally limestone formation. The scenery around is picturesque and agreeable. It contains 32 dwelling houses, 2 mercantile stores, 1 house of public worship, (Methodist,) 2 common schools, 1 fulling and dying establishment, 1 manufacturing flour mill, 1 tavern, 1 tanyard, 1 saddler, 1 wagon maker, and 2 weavers; coopers and shoemakers are the most numerous class of mechanics. A Sulphur Spring is situated about 3 ms. E. of this place on a little creek which falls into the Opequan, at the distance of 300 yards from the spring. Here the scenery is delightful. The beautiful Opequan winds and meanders along in a manner that must interest the dullest fancy. There is a large house near this spring which was occupied as a boarding house some 3 or 4 years since, when these springs were in vogue. These waters are strongly impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen, and act as a gentle purgative, from which it may be inferred that they contain saline matter. It was a place of much resort, but is now from the want of accommodation, visited only by the passing traveller, or those who dwell in the vicinity. This is to be regretted, for with its scenery and the excellent qualities of the waters, it could not fail to be a source of renovation to the invalid. Falling Waters, P. O. 79 ms. N. W. of W. and 180 from R. The Falling Waters are situated on the bank of the Potomac, about lat. 39° 29′ N. and long. 0° 44′ W. of W. C., 8 ms. from Martinsburg, and 5 S. W. of Williamsport, Md. at the isthmus formed by a circular bend in the river, of about 21 ms. in perimeter, and only 4 across. It contains but 3 dwelling houses, 1 of which has been long occupied as a tavern, 1 manufacturing flour mill, a mill for grinding lime for hydraulic cement, a cooper's shop and post office. Population 34, 9 of whom are slaves. There are in the vicinity 1 Presbyterian and 2 Methodist houses of worship, and 1 school, in which is taught all the ordinary branches of an English education. The mills are situated immediately on the banks of the river, and are moved by the stream from a large spring which rises about 60 rods from them, and which is dammed at the mill to the height of twenty-four feet; forming a beautiful pond, which is the favorite resort of water fowl, and abounds with fish of a superior quality to those in the river. The view from this point of the valley of the Potomac, and the Chesapeake and Ohio canal, for several miles up and down the river, is highly picturesque. The soil in this neighborhood is various, but generally consists of a bright yellowish clay. It produces from 15 to 20 bushels of wheat to the acre, and about the same quantity of maize, but the low grounds on the margin of the river are generally dark and loamy, and produce from 20 to 25 bushels to the acre. The principal productions are wheat, rye, maize, and potatoes. The gardens produce in abundance all the culinary vegetables adapted to the climate, and the lands generally nearly all of the fruit trees, forest trees, shrubs, &amp;c. that are to be found in the same latitude. Iron ore is found in many places on the surface of the ground, but no attempt has ever been made to discover a mine. Limestone and a species of soft slate abound. There is an excellent never failing chalybeate spring at Grigg's Tavern. The name of Falling Waters was given to this place before the mills were erected, from the precipitous fall of the mill stream over a large alluvial rock, which is 200 feet above the surface of the river. Gerardstown, P. V. 166 ms. from R. and 87 from W., situated in the southern part of the county. This village contains 35 dwelling houses, 2 mercantile stores, 1 tavern, 3 houses of public worship, (1 Presbyterian, 1 Methodist and 1 Lutheran,) 1 common school, 1 temperance society, 1 bible society, 1 tract society, and 1 well organized sunday school, 1 tanyard, 1 saddler, 2 blacksmith shops, 2 wagon makers, 4 boot and shoe factories, and 3 weavers. In the vicinity and on mill creek, are 4 manufacturing flour mills, 1 grist mill and 1 carding machine. Popu- lation whites 150, of whom 1 is a physician; colored 22—total 172. MARTINSBURG, P. V. and seat of justice, 172 ms. from R. and 71 N. W. of W. in lat. 39° 27′ N. and long. 0° 58′ W. of W. C. Martinsburg is a flourishing and wealthy village.

W. of Harper's Ferry, 13 S. of Williamsport, on the Maryland side of the Potomcc, 10 ms. W. of Shepperdstown, 25 S. E. of Berkley Springs, 5 E. of North mountain, and 7 miles S. of the nearest point on the Potomac river, and Chesapeake and Ohio canal. County Courts are held on the 2d Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Parker holds his Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery on the 19th of March and 15th of September. Mill Creek, P. O. 162 ms. from R. and 83 from W. BOTETOURT. Botetourt was created by act of Assembly in 1769, and formed out of a part of Augusta county. It is bounded N. by Alleghany,—N. E. by Rockbridge,—E. by Bedford,—S. by Franklin,—S. W. by Montgomery,— and W. by Giles and Monroe. Its mean length is 37 miles—breadth 28; and area 1057 sq. ms. It extends in lat. from 37° 08′ to 37° 46′ N. and in long. from 2° 28′ to 3° 19′ W. of W. C. This mountainous and elevated county slopes in two directions,—the one eastward towards the general course of the James and Roanoke rivers, and the other northeastward towards the Great Valley, between the Blue Ridge and North mountains. Salem on the Roanoke, and in the southern part of the county, is 1006 feet above tide water, and Pattonsburg on James river, in the northeastern part of the county, is 806 feet. The acclivity is rapid towards the western border on Pott's mountain, and the mean elevation of the arable soil may be assumed at 1250 feet. There is a great deal of very valuable fertile land in this county. The great body of the county is drained by the James and its tributaries, but the southern angle by the Roanoke and its branches; both rivers are navigable from this county to tide water. Population in 1820, 13,590—in 1830, 16,354. This county belongs to the 17th judicial circuit and 9th district. Tax paid in 1833, $3682 00 —in 1834 on lots, $259 64—on land, $2127 42—2634 slaves, $658 50— 5466 horses, $327 96—23 studs, $245 00—36 coaches, $98 85—2 stages, $8 00—25 carryalls, $27 00—15 gigs, $9 00. Total, $3760 37. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $982 58—in 1833, $932 36. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Amsterdam, P. O. 181 ms.

Pattonsburg and Buchanan, P. Villages, 181 ms. from R. and 223 N. W. of W. These two villages were incorporated by an act of Assembly of 1832-3. They are situated on James river, the first on the N. and the last on the S. side. The two are connected by a handsome, permanent toll-bridge across the river. They are 25 miles above Lexington, 12 below Fincastle, and 40 N. W. by W. of Lynchburg. The main western valley stage road runs thro' each of them, and the stage passes daily either up or down. The advantages for trade possessed by the two places above those of any other town in Western Virginia, are such as to insure their gradual if not rapid increase. The contemplated improvements on James river, and the construction of roads opening a better communication with the adjacent counties, when completed, will greatly increase the trade, and they will no doubt become the place of deposite not only for the produce of many of the western counties of Virginia, and parts of Tennessee and Kentucky, but also of most of the goods now wagoned by land from the northern and eastern towns to the west. The two places are at present of about an equal size, and contain together about 50 dwelling houses, 8 mercantile stores, 1 house of public worship, (a handsome brick building) free for all denominations, 1 common school, 2 tobacco and 1 cordage and bagging factory, 1 foundry and tilt hammer manufactory, 1 grist and saw mill, (and one other in the vicinity,) 1 tobacco warehouse, at which the inspection has been revived, also an inspection of flour. The mechanical establishments are—1 tannery, 1 saddlery, 1 boot and shoe factory, 3 tailors, 3 smith shops, 1 thrashing machine factory, and several wheelwrights, carpenters and bricklayers. In addition to which several private residences and a considerable mercantile establishment are erecting in the vicinity of the western end of Buchanan. Population in both villages about 356 persons; of whom 2 are attorneys and 2 regular physicians. Rebecca Furnace, P. O. 178 ms. from R. and 220 N. W. of W. This furnace and another four and a half miles distant from it, are the property of Mr. D. J. Wilson; they are situated on Longs Entry creek, a branch of James river, within three and a half miles of the river, which is navigable thus far for boats of from four to seven tons burthen. The post office is located 18 ms. S. W. of Fincastle, 22 N. E. of Lexington, and 15 ms. from Pattonsburg and Buchanan, and derives its name from the furnace. At these two establishments called the Rebecca and the Jane furnaces, are employed 150 operatives, 87 of which are blacks. The former of these furnaces has been in operation 9 years, and has manufactured on an average from 800 to 850 tons of pig metal per annum. The latter has been in operation only one year, and manufactured an equal quantity. There is a White Sulphur Spring adjoining the fur- nace property, similar in quality to the well known White Sulphur in Greenbrier county, and is called by the name of Dagger's or Wilson's springs. This property has lately been sold to a gentleman of Richmond, who has improved it in a handsome style, so as to afford first rate accommodations. It must become a place of considerable resort, as it has for several years past been visited by from 2 to 300 persons, and has given relief where other springs have been known to fail.—There is also a forge within 7 or 8 miles of these furnaces, known by the name of James river forge, at which are employed from 60 to 100 operatives, principally black; manufacturing from 2 to 300 tons of bar iron annually. Salem, P. V. 180 ms. from R. and 256 S. W. of W., situated in the southern part of the county, 60 ms. S. W. of Lynchburg, in the Great Valley between the Blue Ridge and North mountain, at an elevation of 1020 feet above the level of the Atlantic. It contains 70 houses, including mechanic shops, &amp;c., 6 mercantile stores, 3 taverns, 3 houses of public worship, (1 Methodist, 1 Presbyterian and 1 Baptist,) 2 female and 1 male school, 1 manufacturing flour mill, with a saw mill and wool carding machine adjoining, (and 1 other in the vicinity, with a saw mill annexed, both running 2 pair of buhrs and 2 pair of country stones and elevators,) 1 tan yard, 1 cabinet maker, 2 saddlers, 5 blacksmith shops, 1 boot and shoe factory, 2 tailors, 1 extensive wheat fan manufactory, several carpenters, 1 house painter, and 1 hat manufactory. The Roanoke navigation from Weldon, N. C. to this place is completed by canals, sluices, &amp;c.—distance from Weldon to Salem 244 ms. White population 260 persons, of whom 2 are attorneys, and 3 regular physicians; colored 90—total 350. BROOKE. Brooke was established by the Legislature in 1797, and taken from a portion of Ohio county. It is bounded N. by the Ohio river, which separates it from Columbiana co. Ohio,—W. by the same river, separating it from Jefferson co. of the same State,—S. by Ohio co. Va.,—and E. by Beaver and Washington counties of Pennsylvania. Its mean length is 31 ms., mean breadth 6½; and its area 202 square miles. The surface of this county is very hilly, but the soil is very fertile. Buffaloe, Cross, Haman's, Tomlison's, and a few other creeks of smaller size rise in Pennsylvania and flow through Brooke into the Ohio river. The products of the county are grain, iron, and bituminous coal. Population in 1810, 5,843—1820, 6,631—1830, 7,041. It belongs to the 20th judicial circuit, and 10th district. Tax paid in 1833, $1,312 37—in 1834, on lots, $207 50—land, $721 48—110 slaves, $27 50—2896 horses, $173 76—18 studs, $114 00—7 coaches, $15 00—26 carryalls, $26 00 —5 gigs, $2 50. Total, $1,287 74. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $530 13—in 1833, $476 28. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Bethany, P. V. 375 ms. N. W. of R. and 282 N. W. by W. of W. It was founded in 1818, and is situated 26 miles from the borough of Washington in Pensylvania, on the beautiful stream of Buffaloe creek, 7 miles E. of the Ohio river. It is surrounded by romantic scenery, and the creek curves around it in the exact form of a horse shoe, making a rich alluvial bottom of 120 acres. The surrounding country is hilly, variegated and very fertile, well watered, and for salubrity of air it cannot be surpassed in the United States. This village is the residence and the property of Alexander Campbell, the celebrated reforming Baptist preacher. It contains several dwelling houses, 1 house of public worship, 1 mercantile store, 1 manufacturing flour mill, and saw mill, a printing office, bookbindery, smith shop, and various other mechanical establishments. Bethany is about 16 ms. from Wheeling, 8 from Wellsburg, and 38 from Pittsburg, Pa. The products of the vicinity are flour, pork, beef and wool. The wool growing branch of husbandry is increasing, and the article will soon become one of the chief staples in this part of the country. Population 100. Fairview, P. O. 395 ms. from R. and 302 N. W. by of W. Fairview or N. Manchester, is situated 20 ms. N. of Wellsburg, 2 from the Ohio river on the W. and 4 from the Pennsylvania line on the E. Its situation is beautifully elevated and healthy. It was laid out in 1811 and now contains 22 dwelling houses, 2 mercantile stores, 2 houses of public worship, (Presbyterian,) and 1 common school, 2 tanyards, and 1 saddler. The other mechanics are tailors, boot and shoe makers, carpenters, stone cutters, chair makers, hatters, coopers, blacksmiths, and cabinet makers. In the vicinity there are 4 manufacturing flour mills. New Manchester possesses many advantages as a place of business for the mechanic, manufacturer and merchant. Population 132 persons; of whom 3 are regular physicians. Holliday's Cove, P. O. 384 ms. from R. and 291 N. W. of W. Holliday's Cove is situated near the centre of the county. It is a small but beautiful valley, of a semicircular form, both ends of which terminate on the Ohio river, being 5 ms. in length and one broad. It deserves to be classed among the natural curiosities of Virginia. It is supposed to have been once the channel of the river, or of one branch of it. Between this and the present channel there is literally an island, the summit of which is at least 400 feet above the level of the river, and upon which there are three or four fine plantations. It contains in all about 1000 acres of good land. The S. W. extremity of the valley opens in full view of the town of Steubenville, Ohio, and the northwestern opens on the Ohio immediately at the S. end of Brown's Island. The eastern side is washed by Harmon's creek, affording a very considerable amount of water power, which at present serves a woollen factory, 4 or 5 manufacturing flour mills, and several saw mills. The flour manufactured at these mills, stands high in point of quality in the southern markets. The soil is first rate. The principal staple is wool, of which three or four of the farmers have raised for some years about 10,000 weight. The manufactures are woollen cloths, casinetts, &amp;c. and flour,—the average shipments of which from the valley is annually about 10,000 barrels, the principal part being manufactured in it. There is no village or town yet laid out, but rapid improvements are going up, on the principal road which is the great thoroughfare from Pittsburg, Pa. to Steubenville.—There are at present about 40 dwelling houses, 2 mercantile stores, and 2 taverns. The religious denominations are Presbyterians and Christian Baptists. There are a missionary, a temperance, and sunday school socie- ty. The mechanics are, 3 blacksmiths, 3 house carpenters, 1 stone mason, 2 boot and shoe factories, and 1 cabinet maker. This section of country has been truly styled the garden spot of Brooke county, and being so healthy bids fair to sustain a large and flourishing population, and perhaps no part of Virginia offers a greater opening for capitalists than this, especially for manufacturers. Fuel, &amp;c. may be had for little or no expense, as the surrounding hills abound with inexhaustible mines of stone coal and timber of every description. Population about 300. WELLSBURG, P. V. and seat of justice, 337 ms. from R. and 280 N. W. by W. from W., in lat 41° 18′ and long. 3° 36′ W. of W. C. This is a healthy and wealthy village, beautifully situated on the left bank of the Ohio river, immediately above Buffaloe creek, 16 ms. above Wheeling, on a plain surrounded by a fertile, well improved and healthy country: and inexhaustible bodies of the best stone coal abound on all sides of the place; which is furnished at from 4 to 5 cts per bushel, to the different manufactories, as fuel to the citizens, and for shipping to the southern markets. The neighborhood is rich and cheerful and rapidly improving; the people feeling the benefit of the home market. This flourishing village contains, besides the ordinary county buildings, about 225 dwelling houses, 2 houses of public worship, one Methodist, the other Reformed Baptist, 5 mercantile stores, 1 grocery and confectionary, and 2 shoe stores, 1 academy, in which are taught the Greek and Latin languages; 3 female and 1 male English school, 2 white flint glassworks, 1 glass-cutting establishment, (the machinery propelled by steam power,) 1 large cotton factory, with a front of 72 feet, and 4 stories high, now running 1200 spindles—employing 60 operatives, 1 steam saw mill, which cuts 3000 feet of plank in 12 hours, 1 small woollen manufactory, 1 grist mill, 1 carpet factory, a carding machine, and salt manufactory, 1 extensive stone and red-ware pottery, 2 tan yards, 3 saddlers, 2 printing offices, each issuing a weekly paper, and various other mechanics, 2 extensive porter breweries, 3 large warehouses, 3 extensive manufacturing mills in the vicinity, one of which manufactured 10,000 barrels of flour the past year. There are between 30 and 40,000 barrels of flour exported annually, from this place in steam and flat boats to New Orleans. Its population is about 1400 persons, of whom 3 are resident attorneys and 4 regular physicians. County Courts are held on the last Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, May, August and November. Judge Fry holds his Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery on the 4th of May and October. CABELL. Cabell was created by the legislature in the year 1809, and formed from a portion of Kanawha county,—It is bounded N. E. by Mason, E. by Kanawha, S. E. by Logan, W. by Sandy river, which separates it from Lloyd, Lawrence and Greenwich counties, of Kentucky, and N. by Ohio river which separates it from Galia and Lawrence counties, of Ohio. Its mean length is 35 ms.; mean breadth 29½, and area 1,033 sq. ms. It extends in lat. from 37° 55′ to 38° 40′ N. and in long. from 4° 45′, to 5° 34′ W. of W. C. Besides the great boundary rivers of Ohio, and great Sandy, Cabell is watered by Guyandotte river and Twelve Pole creek, both of which rise in Logan, and flow through this county, dividing it into three nearly equal parts; of these the former is much the largest and longest,—it flows through the county in a north eastern direction, and empties into the Ohio, a few ms. below Barboursville. The face of the country is broken and mountainous, and the soil for the most part rocky and barren. Population in 1810,2,717—in 1820, 4,789,—during both of these periods Cabell included about one-third of the present county of Logan, in 1830 when the county was reduced to its present limits, it contained 5,834. Tax paid in 1833, $666 14—in 1834 on lots, $33 51—on land, $315 30—313 slaves, $78 25—2,060 horses, $123 60—16 studs, $73 00—1 coach, $2 00—2 stages, $4 00—6 carryalls, $6 00. Total, $635 66. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $280 76—in 1833, $207 25. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Brownsville, (see South Landing.) BARBOURSVILLE, P. V. and Seat of Justice, 344 ms. N. W. of R. and 393 S. W. by W. of W. in lat. 38° 24′, and long. 5° 12′ W. of W. C. Barboursville is a handsome little village, situated on the eastern bank of Guyandotte river, 7½ ms. from the mouth of Mud river. The State turnpike which leads from the eastern part of the state, by the great watering places, to the Kentucky line, passes through this village. A tri-weekly line of stages passes through the town to Guyandotte, where it meets a line of stages from Lexington, Kentucky, and a line of steam-boats from Cincinnati. It contains besides the usual county buildings, 25 dwelling houses, 3 mercantile stores, 1 common school, 1 extensive manufacturing flour mill, 1 tan yard, 1 hatter, 2 blacksmiths, 1 tailor and various other mechanics. Population 150 persons, of whom 2 are attorneys, and 1 a regular physician. County Courts are held on the 4th Monday in every month:—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Summers holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 26th of April, and September. Greenbottom, P. O. 359 ms. from R. and 376 from W. Guyandotte, P. V. 352 ms. from R. and 396 S. W. by W. of W., situated immediately on the banks of the Ohio and Guyandotte rivers. It contains about 40 dwelling houses, 5 mercantile stores, 1 house of public worship, free for all denominations, 1 primary school, a steam, grist and saw mill, and a carding machine propelled by the same power, 1 tanyard, 1 saddler, and 2 cabinet makers, with a number of other mechanics. This village is advantageously situated on a point of land formed by the confluence of Guyandotte, with the Ohio river. It possesses commercial facilities of a high order, but hitherto its local advantages have from a want of foresight or enterprise in its citizens, not been duly appreciated. Guyandotte is the western termination of the daily line of stages from Washington City and Richmond. It is much the most important point of steam-boat embarkation, as well as debarkation in western Virginia, with the exception of Wheeling, and there is no good reason why it should not speedily attain to what nature designed it should be, a thriving and flourishing village. Population about 300 persons, of whom 1 is a regular physician. South Landing, or Brownsville, P. V. 349 ms. from R. and 398 W. of W. South landing was incorporated by an act of the Virginia legislature, some 3 or 4 sessions since, and 2 sessions before last, its name was changed to that of Brownsville. It is situated immediately on the Ohio river, 3 ms. below the mouth of Guyandotte, and where the James river and Kanawha turnpike first approaches the Ohio. It is admirably adapted for a point of landing, there being a sufficient depth of water at all seasons for steam, and other boats, to come up to the shore and ride in safety. It is already attracting notice in this point of view and a considerable portion of the produce of the surrounding country, has found its way to the various markets on the river below, through this point: and it is more than probable from the excellency of the landing—the beauty of the situation, the fact that it is here the great Virginia turnpike first approaches the Ohio, and various other considerations, that this is the point where, before many years, the daily line of stages from Fredericksburg and other places will meet the steamboat packets, and where the great western Virginia landing will eventually, be permanently fixed. This town was laid off by the State Engiginer, Mr. Crozet, three years since; but the proprietors of the land for various causes, have not as yet, put the lots into market: there are, therefore, but 5 or 6 dwelling houses and 2 mercantile stores, yet established. But so soon as the point shall be sufficiently known, and the lots put into market, it is expected improvement will rapidly progress, and Brownsville, become a place of no little note in western Virginia. FAYETTE. Fayette was created by act of Assembly in 1831, and formed from a portion of Logan, Greenbrier, Nicholas and Kanawha counties. It is bounded by its parent counties, N. E., N. and N. W. by Kanawha and Nicholas, E. by Greenbrier, S. E. by the same, S. and S. W. by Logan, and W. by Logan and Kanawha. The limits of its latitude and longitude, or its extent in miles, we have no means of ascertaining. The mountains in this county are innumerable. The Gauly mountain has acquired the greatest notoriety on account of its having been the line dividing the county of Kanawha from Greenbrier,—it is a continuation of the Cumberland mountain, which runs from south to north, and is cloven asunder by New river, Big and Little Sewel mountains, dividing Fayette from Greenbrier. There are many more of less note. New river runs through the whole county from E. to W. It is exceedingly rapid and precipitous. The junction of New river and Gauly, constitute the noble great Kanawha, 2 ms. above the falls, and 11 above the Kanawha county line. New river is navigable at no place between the eastern line of the county, and the place where it looses its name by mingling its waters with those of Gauly,—indeed there are but few places which admit of ferries. The stream is borne down with so much force and precipitancy, as to render its crossing very hazardous,—foaming and pitching down a rough and rocky channel, with as much fury as if precipitated down a succession of precipices. The falls being so rapidly successive as to resemble artificial steps. Gauly river is the next in order, it is the line between the counties of Fayette and Nicholas for several miles: after it comes within 6 miles of New river it ceases to be the line and bends round to the S. W. and meets that noble and capacious stream. It is navigable about 8 ms. above its mouth. The Clear Fork and March Fork of Coal, also either take their rise in this county, or acquire great accession as they pass through it. Their capacity is too small to admit of being much navigated. There is a great diversity of soil in this county, it being rich, midling and sterile, and producing corn, wheat, rye, oats and potatoes of both kinds. There are no manufactories of note. The mineral resources of the county have not been at all developed. There are strong and innumerable indications of iron ore,—much surface ore is found in many places, indicating banks of ore, and chalybeate springs are interspersed all over the county. Mounds apparently of great antiquity are found in some places; from one of which, a human skeleton and many artificial curiosities, such as were common among Indians, have been taken. "The Kanawha Turnpike passes through this whole county from E. to W. and by travelling along it within 8 or 10 ms. of the junction of New river and Gauly, you come in sight of the former, you stand on a high cliff of rocks called Marshal's pillar, or the Hawk's nest, and see the river dashing and pitching with maddening fury, eight hundred or a thousand feet below you,—you approach the edge of the rock to look over with great caution and timidity, and few have been so bold and daring, as to approach the edge of the precipice so near as to take a perpendicular view to the bottom,—you may stand on the top of this cliff, and throw a stone into the river below. By drawing a superficial line from the top of the precipice to the bottom of the river, thence to the opposite cliff, and thence a horizontal line to the beginning, you would have a triangle, the perpendicular of which would be about 850 ft." The falls of Kanawha constitutes a curiosity to be specially remarked. The whole stream perhaps a half a mile in width, is precipitated over a craggy rock several perpendicular feet. The rock crosses the river obliquely, and when the water is low it is divided into two prongs, one of which washes the southern, and the other the northern shore, affording the finest water power to propel machinery of any perhaps in Virginia; but when the water is high, the rock is covered with one unbroken sheet, and presents to the beholder a sight of great sublimity. As this county has been created since the last census, there is no means of ascertaining its population, which was then included in that of its parent counties. It belongs to the 18th judicial circuit, and 9th district. Tax paid in 1833, $220 80—in 1834,—on land, $129 65—79 slaves, $19 75 —809 horses, $48 54—3 studs, $9 00—8 carryalls, $8 00—1 gig, $1 00. Total, $215 94. No report of school commissioners for 1832. Expended in educating poor children in 1833, $278 70. County Courts are held on the 3rd Monday in every month:—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Duncan holds his Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 1st of April and September. Fayette being a new county, and the county town not yet designated, we therefore place the courts immediately under the head of the county. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Coal River Marshes, P. O. 227 ms. from R. and 336 from W. Gauley's Bridge, P. O. 278 ms. N. W. of R. and 344 S. W. by W. of W., situated at the falls of the Great Kanawha river, 2 ms. below the junction of Gauley and New river, and 35 above Charleston. The river is here 500 yds. wide and has a fall of 22 ft. over a ledge of rocks, which extends entirely across the stream, and is received into a basin below, 60 ft. in depth. This is the last navigable point on the Kanawha, and presents one of the best sites for machinery in Virginia. There are here 2 saw mills, 1 manufacturing flour mill, 2 mercantile stores, and 1 hotel. A daily mail arrives. This is one of the wildest and most picturesque regions of the state. A very fine bridge erected at the expense of the state, at this spot, was consumed a few years since by fire, applied by an incendiary. Mountain Cove, P. O. 273 ms. from R. and 315 from W. Sewell's, P. O. 246 ms. from R. and 288 from W. FLOYD. Floyd was created by the Legislature in January 1831, and formed from a portion of Montgomery county. It is bounded N. by Montgomery, —E. by Franklin—S. by Patrick,—and W. by Grayson. It is 35 miles in length from E. to W., and its mean width is 15. Floyd is mountainous, but there is only one of the many knobs and spurs which cover its surface, which deserves to be noticed; and this is but little less worthy of observation than the celebrated Peaks of Otter of Bedford. This is called from its resemblance to the animal, the Buffalo Knob. It is not itself so high as the Peaks of Otter, but its base is more elevated than theirs, and the prospect from the top is truly sublime. On the north, east, and west, the beholder is amazed at the boundless succession of mountains rising beyond mountains,—whilst far away to the south, the plain seems to stretch to an interminable length. On the east the knob is accessible on horse-back, being two miles in height from the beginning of the ascent to the highest point, on the west it breaks off precipitately, and presents the shape of the animal whose name it bears. This country is watered by Little river, a branch of New river. Little river is composed of three branches, called South, Middle, and West Forks, upon which are situated the most fertile and extensive meadows in the county. Laurel Fork, a branch of Big Reedy Island creek, waters the southwestern portion of the county. It washes the base of the Buffalo Knob.—This county lying upon the Alleghany, where it approaches the Blue Ridge, is not very fertile. It is much better adapted to grazing, than to grain. Indian corn does not thrive well, but wheat, rye, oats, and buckwheat, are raised in the greatest abundance. Horses, oxen, hogs and sheep are raised for market in great quantities, and are the only staples. Population between 7 and 8000, and rapidly increasing. It belongs to the 16th judicial circuit and 8th district. Taxes paid in 1833, $294 46—in 1834, on lots, $11 54—on land, $171 56—151 slaves, $37 75—1191 horses, 43 $71 46—6 studs, $27 00—1 coach, $2 00—5 carryalls, $5 00. Total, $316 31. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $105 52—in 1833, $544 50. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. JACKSONVILLE, P. V. and seat of justice, 227 ms. from R. and 305 from W. This village is located in the most fertile and healthy part of the county. The lots were laid off some 12 months since, and a considerable number of them sold. It of course does not contain many improvements as yet. There is however a handsome court house erected, 5 dwelling houses, and a number of others are now building, 2 mercantile stores, 1 house of public entertainment, 1 tan yard, 1 saddler, 1 blacksmith shop, and post office. Jacksonville is situated 100 ms. W. of Lynchburg, its chief market or place of trade, 35 W. of Franklin C. H., 20 S. of Montgomery C. H., 55 E. of Grayson C. H., and 35 N. of Patrick C. H. Such is the healthiness, that there is only 1 physician in the county. County Courts are held on the 3d Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Saunders holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 17th of April and September. Simpson's P. O. situated 21 ms. N. E. of the C. H. 211 ms. from R. and 289 from W. Stoney Fork, P. O. 229 ms. from R. and 307 from W., situated 2 ms. W. of the C. H. It contains a mercantile store, tavern, and blacksmith shop. FREDERICK. Frederick was created by act of Assembly in 1738, and formed from a portion of Orange. It is bounded N. by Morgan, Berkeley, and Jefferson,—E. by Loudoun and Fauquier,—S. by Shenandoah,—and W. by Hardy and Hampshire. Its mean length is 29 miles, mean breadth 25?; and its area 745 square miles. It lies between lat. 38° 50′ and 39° 25′ N. and long 0° 48′ and 1° 28′ W. of W. C. The surface of this county is very much diversified by hill and mountain scenery, and by diversity of soil. It occupies S. from the Potomac part of the continuation of the great valley, in which are situated Lebanon, the lower part of Dauphin, the greatest part of Cumberland and Franklin counties, Pennsylvania, and Jefferson and Berkley counties, Virginia. The Shenandoah river traverses the southeastern border meandering along the northwestern base of the Blue Ridge. Opequan, Back and Sleepy creeks, flowing N. N. E. into the Potomac, also rise in Frederick. The slope of the county is of course northeastward, in a similar direction with the streams. The ground near Harper's Ferry and along the Potomac is about 200 feet above tide water, and allowing a similar rise from the Potomac, the mean height of Frederick would be about 400 feet. The soil of this county is highly productive, though the face of the county is considerably broken by mountain ridges. It is one of the wealthiest, most hospitable, and most intelligent counties in the State. Population in 1810, 22,574—1820, 24,706 —1830, 26,046. It belongs to the thirteenth judicial circuit, and seventh district. Tax paid in 1833, $8,987 19—in 1834 on lots, $1,113 71—1 land, $5,514 65—3,842 slaves, $960 50—8,506 horses, $510 36—38 studs, $453 00—158 coaches, $427 80—2 stages, $4 00—47 carryalls, $63 90—31 gigs, $71 75. Total, $9,119 67. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $1186 85—in 1833, $1988 47. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Back Creek Valley, P. O. 164 ms. from R. and 85 W. of W. Battletown, or Berryville, P. O. 160 ms. from R. and 59 N. W. of W. This is a healthy and flourishing little village, situated on Opequan creek, on the direct post road from. Winchester to Washington City, 12 miles from the former. It contains about 30 dwelling houses, 1 handsome Episcopal house of public worship, lately erected, 1 academy, and 3 female schools, 2 mercantile stores, several mechanic shops, &amp;c. But the business principally transacted in this place is of a commercial nature. General Morgan of Revolutionary memory, resided for a considerable part of his life in the immediate vicinity of this village. It was the scene of many of those personal and party combats for which he was so remarkable. This circumstance is said to have given rise to the name of Battletown—by which it is now generally known. Its proper name is Berryville. Population about 300 persons; of whom 2 are attorneys, and 5 regular physicians. Brucetown, P. O. 157 ms. from R. and 79 from W., situated 7 ms. W. of Winchester. It contains about 25 houses, 1 Methodist house of public, 2 mercantile stores, 1 tavern, 2 manufacturing flour mills, 1 tailor, 1 wagon maker, 1 smith shop, and 1 boot and shoe factory. Population 75. Front Royal, P. V. 139 ms. from R. and 75 W. of W. It is situated in the extreme southeastern angle of the county, 20 ms. S. E. of Winchester, on the S. side of the Shenandoah river, a mile from its banks, in a valley between the river and Blue Ridge, near the junction of the counties of Culpeper, Fauquier, and Shenandoah. The situation of this village is eligible and pleasant. It contains 37 dwelling houses, 2 houses of public worship, (1 Methodist, a neat brick building, and 1 free for all denomination,) 2 academies, in one of which is taught the Languages, 2 houses of public entertainment, 4 mercantile stores, and 1 apothecary shop. There is one extensive manufacturing flour mill, 3 wagon makers, which have acquired some celebrity, 3 tan yards, 2 saddlers, 3 boot and shoe factories, 3 smith shops, 2 tailors, 1 chair maker, 1 cabinet maker, 2 house joiners, 1 brick maker, and 1 wheat fan manufactory. Population 350 persons, of whom 1 is an attorney, and 3 are regular physicians. There is a small and beautiful stream passing through the E. end of this village, on the main street, called Happy creek, which is visited by fish when the Shenandoah is high; and a beautiful range of mountain scenery presents itself in view of the town. In the vicinity are three manufacturing flour mills, turned by the noble Shenandoah river. About 3¼ of a mile from the W. end of this place, but in Shenandoah county, is situated Allen's Cave, said by some to surpass Weyer's cave for the extent and sublimity of its caverns. (See Allen's cave, Shenandoah Co.). This cave is much frequented by parties in the summer season. The surrounding country, viewing it from this village, is grand and picturesque. There are many handsome residences and delightful seats situated on eminences in the neighborhood. Among them is the agreeable mansion of the hospitable and venerable James Marshall, (a brother of the Chief Justice,) whose residence is situated on Happy creek, after which it is very properly named, as those who have been its guests will be willing to testify. Gainsboro', P. O. 159 ms. from R. and 80 W. of W., situated on the road leading to Cumberland, 9 ms. N. W. of Winchester, 1 mile W. of Hog creek, and ¼ E. of Back creek. It contains 30 dwelling houses, 2 houses of public worship, (1 Methodist and 1 Quaker,) 1 common school, and 1 house of public entertainment. There are 2 tan yards, 2 saddlers, 1 boot and shoe maker, 3 smith shops, 1 cabinet maker, 1 house carpenter, 1 tailor, and 1 cooper. Population 100 persons, of whom 1 is a physician. In the vicinity is located a woollen manufactory, and 2 manufacturing flour mills. Howellsville, P. V. 147 ms. from R. and 94 N. W. by W. of W., situated immediately on the banks of the Shenandoah, where Howells' run empties into that river, about 7 ms. distant both from Front Royall and Berry's Ferry. This little village is rapidly improving. It contains 6 or 8 dwelling houses, 1 house of public worship, free for all denominations, 1 miscellaneous store, 2 manufacturing flour mills, 1 wagon maker, 1 boot and shoe factory, 1 smith shop, 1 fancy weaver, 1 house carpenter, &amp;c. The bottom lands in this neighborhood are exceedingly rich, and produce in abundance Indian corn, wheat, rye, oats, &amp;c;. The mountain lands are productive and well timbered.

The situation of this place is pleasant and healthy. The surrounding country is limestone land of good quality, and in a high state of cultivation. The roads from Winchester to Gerardstown pass through this village, distant 8 miles S. of the former, and 6 N. of the latter. The road from Charlestown, Jefferson, also passes through to the Bloomery gap, or Sherrard's Store, distant 15 ms. from the former. Population 70. No physician or attorney reside in this place. WINCHESTER, P. T. and County Seat.—Of the large and wealthy county of Frederick, and one of the most considerable towns in western Virginia, is situated in N. lat 39° 11′, W. long. 77° 28′;* * Agreeable to late observations of Capt. Graham, U. S. Topographical Engineer, and Mr. Bruce, principal of the Winchester Academy. distance from Washington, 71 ms.; Richmond, 150; Harper's Ferry, 30. This place is situated in the fertile valley of Virginia, in the midst of a rich and abundant country, and a thriving and industrious people. It is one of the oldest towns in western Virginia. Being somewhat celebrated in the history of our Indian warfare and revolutionary struggle, a brief review of its early history will, it is believed, be interesting, as it is closely connected with the early actions of that eminent individual, who afterwards became endeared to his countrymen by the glorious deeds which gained him the noble title of Father of his country. Tradition informs us that the ground on the edge of the present site of Winchester was occupied by a large and powerful tribe of Indians, called the Shawnees or Shawanees, and some springs at that point, are called the Shawnee Springs at this day. The earliest accounts of the settlement of Winchester, state that there were 2 houses on its present location as early as 1738, situated near the town run, but its establishment as a town commenced in Feb. 1752, in the 25th year of the reign of George the II when the General Assembly passed an "act for the establishment of the town of Winchester."* * When the town of Winchester was first laid off by Lord Fairfax, he made the town lots of half an acre each, and by his conveyances annexed an out-lot of five acres adjoining the town, to each town or in-lot; and by the condition of each grant, made the in and the out-lots inseparable, it being the design of this benevolent proprietor, that each house holder in town, owner of a lot, should always have appurtenant a convenient parcel of land for small cultivation or pasturage. The intent of these grants has been, however, long since evaded, by conveying one lot in fee, and the other by lease for 1000 years, renewable forever at a nominal rent. In 1758 it was enlarged in consideration of an additional quantity of land being laid off in lots by Col. James Wood, now called in the plot of the town, Wood's addition. Trustees were then appointed consisting of Lord Fairfax, Col. Martin and others: Vide Henning's Statutes at Large: vol. 7. p. 135. Additions to the town, were also made by Lord Fairfax.† † Lord Fairfax was the proprietor of the Northern Neck of Virginia, he lived and died at Greenway Court, about 12 ms. from Winchester, and was buried at the old Episcopal church of that place. (See extent of his domain under Culpeper. Col. Wood is therefore entitled to the honor of being the founder. Winchester is mentioned by General Washington, as being one of the points in his route, in his celebrated mission, by order of Governor Dinwiddie, to the French authorities on the Ohio. He came from Alexandria to Winchester where he procured baggage horses, &amp;c. This was in November 1753.‡ ‡ See his Journal of the expedition, very properly preserved in Marshall's life of Washington—new edition. vol. 1. p. 461. In the French and Indian warfare that succeeded, Washington fixed his head quarters at Winchester, which was then a frontier settlement. The North mountain a few miles west of Winchester being the boundary.— From the fear occasioned by the attacks of the French and Indians, this place was almost the only settlement west of the Blue Ridge, which range of mountains, was as late as 1756, the north western frontier. At that period public stores to a large amount were deposited at Winchester, for the frontier settlement. After the distinguished action at Great Meadows, July 4, 1754, Washington returned with his regiment to Winchester to recruit, soon after which, he was joined by a few companies from Maryland and North Carolina, after which reinforcement they were ordered by the Liuetenant Governor, to march immediately over the Alleghany, to drive the French from Fort du Quesne, or build one in its vicinity. After the disastrous defeat of Braddock, Washington with the remains of the brave Virginia troops retreated to Winchester. Upon the invasion of the frontiers by the French and Indians, Washington then on his way to Williamsburg, the Seat of Government, was overtaken by an express, below Fredericksburg, with the intelligence that the French and Indians had broken in upon the frontier settlements, and were murdering and capturing women and children, burning houses, destroying crops, &amp;c. and that the troops, stationed among them were insufficient for their protection. He immediately hastened back to Winchester, where the utmost confusion and alarm prevailed. His attempts to raise the militia were unsuccessful. He sent urgent orders to the country Lieutenants, east of the Blue Ridge, to hasten their militia to Winchester, but before these orders could be executed, the enemy which had done so much injury and caused so much alarm, had re-crossed the Alleghany mountain. Col. Washington after repeated ineffectual efforts to arouse the government to act on the offensive, and adopt a more efficient system of warfare, by sending a force sufficient to destroy Fort du Quesne, at length prevailed, and Gen. Forbes was ordered to undertake the campaign for its reduction. On the 24th of May, 1758, orders were issued to Washington's regiment to rendezvous at Winchester, and be in readiness to march in 15 days. June 24, the Virginia troops in pursuance to the orders they had received, moved in detachments from Winchester to Fort Cumberland, where they assembled early in July. Upon the reduction of Fort du Quesne, (when its name was changed to Pitt, in honor of the then British Minister,) Col. Washington after furnishing 200 men from his regiment to garrison the Fort, marched the rest back to Winchester, whence he soon proceeded to Williamsburg to take his seat in the house of Delegates, of which he had been elected a member by the County of Frederick, while at Fort Cumberland. During these contests a Fort was built at Winchester, the remains of which are still visible at the north end of the principle street. In Henning's Statutes, vol 7. page 33, we find the 16th clause of a law passed March, 1756, which refers to this Fort, and the appropriation for its erection in these words, "and whereas it is now judged necessary, that a Fort should be immediately erected in the town of Winchester, county of Frederick, for the protection of the adjacent inhabitants against the barbarities daily committed by the French and their Indian allies be it therefore enacted that the Governor or Commander-in-chief of the colony for the time being is here by empowered and desired to order a Fort to be built with all possible despatch, in the aforesaid town of Winchester; and that his honor give such orders and instructions for the immediate effecting, and garrisoning the same as he shall think necessary for the purpose aforesaid." The act also appropriates the sum of £1000 for carrying the above provision into effect. This Fort was called Fort Loudoun, in honor of the British General, Lord Loudoun, who had been appointed to the command of the British troops in America. It is stated in the History of the Valley upon authority, entitled to the highest respect, the gentleman furnishing the information referred to, having been informed by Washington's officers, that Washington marked out the site of this Fort and superintended its erection, that he bought a lot in Winchester, had a blacksmith shop erected on it, and brought from Mount Vernon his own blacksmith to make the necessary iron work for the Fort. The very spot is pointed out, where Washington's own residence was situated. It is stated that his chamber was above the gateway of the Fort in a situation commanding a view of the principal street of the town. This Fort covered an area of half an acre, and there is still much of its enbankments and mounds remaining. There is also a well, from which water now rises to the surface, sunk through the solid rock 103 ft. The labor of throwing up this Fort, and sinking this well, was said to have been performed by Washington's regiment. The Fort contained a strong Garrison; and it is stated by one of the oldest inhabitants of Winchester, to have mounted six 18 pounders, six 12 pounders, six 6 pounders, 4 swivels and 2 howittzers, and to this day grape shot and cannon balls are found there. These cannons were removed from Winchester, early in the war of the revolution. This Fort was said to have been once reconnoitered by a French officer, but never was attacked by the enemy. Winchester was used for its security as a depot for Hessian and British prisoners, taken during the revolution. The number increased so much, that barracks were erect ed 4 ms. N. of the town, for their accommodation at one time in the year 1781, the number of prisoners was 1600. Having given this sketch of the early history of Winchester, which in a work like this is justifiable, as it is interesting to all Virginians, and all other citizens of the United States, to recall the associations and localities of those "times that tried men's souls," and more especially of this place from its intimate connection with the first actions and trials of the Father of our country; we will now proceed to give some account of the statistics of Winchester. The principal part of the town, is built on low ground, from which the streets ascend. It is very compactly built, and the streets are laid out regularly, crossing each other at right angles. The principal street is well paved, and the sidewalks in all the streets are more or less improved. The houses are generally built of brick or stone. The number of houses is about 500, and the supposed population near 4000. The census of 1830, made the population 3620 of the following description of persons: Free white males, 1429 Free white females 1275 Slave males, 290 Slave females, 365 Free colored males, 100 Free colored females, 164 Total, 3520 The active population of Winchester, may be arrayed under the 3 general divisions of professional, mercantile and mechanical classes:— 1st Professional.—There are 6 clergymen, 1 Methodist Episcopal, 1 Presbyterian, 1 Episcopalian, 2 Evangelical Lutheran, 1 Methodist Protestant. The legal profession is quite numerous, and the Winchester Bar has always held one of the highest stations in Virginia. It has given a presiding Judge to the Supreme Court of Appeals; and several Judges to the bench of the General Court. There has been a flourishing Law School which only ceased with the elevation of the Lecturer to the Court of Appeals. The present number of resident lawyers of the Winchester Bar is 22. besides these, a number of lawyers attend the terms of the courts in Winchester. Physicians.—The number of the medical profession is 7. The promising Medical School established here some years since by the Medical Society of the Valley, has been discontinued,—two of its professors have been called to distinguished stations in other institutions,—one professor of Theory and Practice of Medicine, in Transylvania University, Kentucky, and the other, to the Chair of Medicine in the University of Va. The mercantile class of the community in Winchester, consists for the most part of business men, who are careful and prudent in all their dealings. Many of them have in consequence become wealthy. There are 41 stores in Winchester of the following description:—32 dry goods and grocery stores, 1 apothecary and druggist, 1 auction and commission store, 3 iron stores, 2 stove and casting manufactories, 1 confectionary and fruit store, 1 book and stationary, and 1 lottery office. The mechanics are as follows, to wit:—2 brewers, 4 bakers, 1 bookbinder, 12 victuallers, 1 brass founder, 13 carpenters, 3 chair makers, 1 clock and mathematical instrument maker, 3 extensive coach manufactories, giving employment to a great number of hands, 1 gunsmith, 4 house painters and glaziers, 6 masons and bricklayers, 1 or namental painter, 1 pottery, 1 rope and reed maker, 9 boot and shoe factories, 5 silver smiths, watch repairers and jewellers, 4 tanners and curriers, 3 barbers, 1 buhr stone maker, 17 blacksmiths, 4 brickmakers, 2 carpet weavers, 4 cabinet makers, 2 copper smiths, 2 coopers, 2 confectionaries, 1 dyer, 2 hatters, 2 lock and white smith's, 8 milliners, 6 plasterers, 2 ploughmakers, 5 saddle and harness makers, 2 skindressers and glovers, 1 silver plater, 1 saddle tree maker, 3 tobacconists, 2 turners, 1 tallow chandler, 5 tinplate workers, 9 tailors, (4 merchant tailors,) 1 upholsterer, 10 waggon makers, 3 weavers, 1 wheelwright. This list embraces 46 different trades, and upwards of 170 master workmen. It is presumed that there are several hundred journeymen and apprentices employed by these persons. There are 6 merchant mills in the immediate vicinity of Winchester, 1 cabinet ware factory, part of the machinery turned by water, 1 carpet factory which makes carpeting of a superior quality, much admired for the beauty of its texture, and the brilliancy and permanency of its colors. There is 1 cotton factory, but at present its operations are suspended. The abundant water power and its admirable location, justifies the prediction that Winchester will one day become a great manufacturing town. There is 1 academy for youth founded by an act of the Legislature, as far back as 1788, now 46 years since. It has been in operation the greater part of that period, and has had as many as 80 pupils in one year. It is estimated, that at least 1000 young men from different and distant parts of the state, have been educated in part or entirely at this institution. This academy has maintained, perhaps as high a reputation as any other similar institution in the state. There are, besides the academy, an institute for young ladies, and 11 other schools. There are few places in the state, which present greater inducements to parents, desiring to have their children well educated than Winchester. It is remarkable for its health, the purity of the water; and what is more important for the correct, moral and religious tone of feeling, which prevails among most of its inhabitants. It is also a remarkable fact which should be stated, that although there is no night watch, a robbery is almost unknown, and a general state of good order prevails. The public buildings are a C. H., clerk's office, jail, market house and Common Council Hall, Masonic Hall, and Library and Lyceum building. There are several excellent hotels; one of which, lately erected, is surpassed probably by none in the state, in the accommodations for travellers. There are 9 churches in Winchester, 2 Presbyterian, 1 Episcopalian, 2 Methodist's, (1 for colored persons,) 1 Roman Catholic, 1 Lutheran, 1 Baptist, 1 Friend's or Quaker's. The Episcopal church erected in 1829, is one of the best specimens of Gothic artichecture in the state. It is much admired by strangers for the beauty and appropriateness 44 of the style of architecture. It is finished with great taste in the interior, and has a fine toned organ. There is no asylum in Winchester, but there are a great many associations for benevolent, religious or literary purposes; such as the Bible Society, Tract Society, with a flourishing Depository, Sunday School Union, with a good and increasing depository, for the supply of 7 counties around Winchester; ladies' Benevolent Society, for relieving and attending to the wants of the poor and destitute sick, ladies Colonization Society, a general Temperance Society, Young Men's Temperance and Colonization Societies, a Mechanic's Society, a prosperous Masonic Lodge and Chapter, 2 large fire companies, provided with engines, hose and necessary apparatus. There is a Library and Lyceum of reading, to which is attached a good collection of minerais. The Library is yet small, which is partly to be attributed to the number of private Libraries owned in the town. There are 2 printing offices in Winchester, one issues the Winchester Virginian, the other, the Winchester Republican. There is also a monthly periodical published at the Republican office, for the publication of sermons. generally of living ministers of the Lutheran church, of all parts of the United States. It is extensively circulated, and well patronized by the members of this church. There are 2 Banks in Winchester, the Farmers' Branch Bank, and the Bank of the Valley, with branches at Romney, Leesburg and Charlestown. The Winchester and Frederick County Savings Institution, incoporated last session of the Legislature, has lately gone into operation with encouraging prospects. Winchester possesses one great and inestimable advantage as a place of residence, which would leave this article imperfect not to notice in detail. We mean the never failing supply of pure, wholesome spring water. There is no place in the Union better supplied with water, or of better quality. Philadelphia boasts of its water works, but the water there is river water, whilst that supplied to the citizens of Winchester is spring water, cold enough to be used without ice during the summer. The water was introduced into the town 28 or 30 years ago by wooden pipes, through which it was conducted from a fine, never failing spring, about half a mile west of the town,—the right to the use of which, was reserved to the citizens of Winchester by Lord Fairfax, by express provision. The wooden pipes were taken up in 1828, and iron pipes put down in their places. The main pipe has a bore of about 6 inches: the lateral pipes about 3 inches. The length of the iron pipes is about 3 ms. The whole cost to the corporation did not exceed $12,500. The water is now conveyed in these pipes through all the principal streets, and by lead pipes leading from the iron, into the yards of a majority of the citizens, without their paying any water tax for the privilege. The water is carried to the extreme parts of the town, affording a constant and abundant supply for all the purposes of domestic use, and to extinguish fire if necessary; for which purpose, fire plugs are provided at convenient distances. This article will now be concluded, with a brief notice of the internal improvements in contemplation, and in progress connected with Winchester. These are the Valley turnpike, (for which the Legislature passed an act the last session) to extend from Winchester to Harrisonburg. This road has not yet been commenced, but when made will greatly increase the travelling through this Valley, which presents great inducements to travellers, from the beauty of its scenery, and its mineral springs. Perhaps no part of the world affords a greater variety of mineral springs, of qualities in- estimable in the restoration of health, than the Valley of Virginia. The state road from Winchester to Parkersburg, on the Ohio, is now being made: it will be completed, it is thought, within 2 years,—its length is 235 ms. This will be a very important road in connecting the Atlantic with the western states; but the great outlet for all these roads, and for the rich Valley of Virginia, will be the Winchester and Potomac Rail Road, commenced in 1833: this road it is thought, will be completed in 1836,—its length is about 31 ms connecting at Harper's Ferry, with those two grand national works, the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. The effect of these improvements in raising the value of property in Winchester, from bringing it in such close proximity with the eastern cities, and the natural increase of business and population, must have an influence on the prosperity of this place—the extent of which no one can foresee. If the same results attend these improvements which have been produced in other places, which are destitute of the same natural advantages, the prosperity of Winchester must be increased to an extent, unparalleled in all its previous history. County and Corporation Courts are held on the Monday before the 1st Tuesday in every month. Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Parker, holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 1st of May and November. GILES. Giles was created by the Legislature in 1806, and formed from a portion of Tazewell and Monroe counties. It is bounded N. by Monroe,—N. E. by Botetourt,—E. and S. E. by Montgomery,—S. by Wythe,—S. W. by Tazewell,—and W. by the great flat top mountain, which separates it from Logan. The form of this county approaches to a half moon, and the length between the points about 70 miles. It lies between lat 37° 06′ and 37° 43′ N. and long. 3° 15′ and 4° 15′ W. of W. C. This county is very mountainous, the mean level of the cultivated land being 1600 feet above the ocean. Several ridges of mountains pass through this county, the principal of which are Peter's and East River mountains. These are parts of the same ridge, which appear to have been split asunder by the waters of New river, which passes through them at the Big Fall. Near Parisburg, proudly preeminent stands The Angel's Rest, a pinnacle that overtops all the mountains of the neighborhood, and affords one of the most interesting prospects in the western country. The Salt Pond mountain also deserves particular notice. This mountain derives its name from the circumstance, that the old settlers of the country usually gathered their stock, that ran in the range at this place, for the purpose of giving them salt. It is situated about 12 miles to the east of Parisburg; near the top of it, there is an immense lake of water of an unknown depth and 3 or 4 miles in circumference. It is said by the old settlers of the country that this pond has arisen from a spring which flowed into a kind of natural basin situated between two lofty mountains, and has gradually increased overtoping tree after tree, which grew on the sides of the mountain, until it at last found an outlet over the ridge that unites the two mountains. This pond now forms a beautiful expanse of water near the summit of one of the loftiest mountains in Virginia, which frequently excites the curiosity of strangers, and to which the gentry of the county often resort for the object of pleasure and amusement. In the upland and mountainous parts of the county the soil is barren and rocky, but in the valleys between the mountains and on the low grounds of the creeks and rivers, the land is very fertile and produces freely every kind of grain. Hemp is the principal staple, a considerable quantity of which is annually wagoned to Buchanan, at the head of boat navigation on James river. In a direction from S. E. to N. W. New river runs through this county, and fertilizes a large portion of its soil. The bottoms on each side of this stream are remarkably rich and constitute the most valuable part of the county, affording many handsome country seats, which in some instances are improved with substantial houses. This river is also remarkable for its fine fish, particularly the mud and blue cat, which are very much celebrated among travellers for their fine flavor and astonishing size, some weighing from 60 to 70 pounds. Other streams of less note penetrate through this county, the advantages derived from which are very considerable in a country like this, where the most choice spots are those which lie on the margin of water courses, and have been enriched by their fertilizing influence. The White Sulphur Springs of Giles county are supposed to be inferior in quality to none in the State, while they combine with the excellence of their waters many advantages of natural scenery, which if they were well improved would give them a superiority over most of the watering places in the neighboring counties, and would be a source of increasing wealth to the county of Giles. These springs are situated on the banks of New river, 9 miles E. of Parisburg, on what is supposed to be the nearest route from that place to Christiansburg in the county of Montgomery. Here the mind at one moment may be engaged with the most pleasing emotions, derived from the river scenery, and at the next it will be struck with the sight of the most awful and majestic cliffs, which at this place overhang the bed of the river, in all the pomp of lonely grandeur. In a few years if these springs should be properly managed, and sufficient accommodations provided, they will afford one of the most delightful summer retreats in the western part of the State,—possessing every advantage that the invalid can reasonable hope for, and presenting many attractive inducements for the votaries of pleasure and gaity. The most numerous religious sect of the county is that of the Methodists; but they have as yet erected no house of worship deserving notice. Population in 1820, 4,522—the county then including a large tract now included in Logan county—in 1830, 5,270. This county belongs to the 16th judicial circuit, and 8th district. Tax paid in 1833, $564 21—in 1834, on lots, $21 20—on land, $266 15—298 slaves, $74 50—2348 horses, $140 88—9 studs, $47 00—3 carryalls, $3 00—1 gig, 50 cts. Total, $553 23. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $281 66 —in 1834, $290 56. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Big Spring, P. O. 264 ms. S. W. of R. and 324 S. W. by W. of W. situated in the western part of the county, on the main post road leading from Parisburg to Tazewell C. H.—27 ms. from the former. It contains several dwelling houses, a grist mill, a wool carding machine, and a blacksmith shop. It is located within 100 yards of the line which divides the counties of Tazewell and Giles. Population 9 whites and 7 blacks. Chapman's Mills, P. O. 255 ms. S. W. of R. PARISBURG, P. V. and county seat. 297 ms. S. W. by W. of W. C. and 240 S. W. from R., lat 37° 21′ long. 3° 43′ W. of W. C. This village is situated on the S. W. side of New river, three-fourths of a mile from its bank, where that stream passes through Peters' mountain, immediately above the gap, and directly on the main post road, 18 ms. from the Red Sulphur Springs. It was established by act of Assembly, and laid off in June 1806; but owing to its then being in one of the extreme frontier counties, the improvements have progressed but slowly. It contains, besides the ordinary county buildings (which are handsome) about 30 dwelling houses, (mostly built of stone) and a number of others in progress of erection, 4 mercantile stores, 2 taverns, 2 common schools, 2 tan yards, 2 saddlers, 2 hatters, 2 cabinet makers, 1 chair maker and painter, 1 boot and shoe factory, 1 wheelwright, 1 tailor, and 1 brick and stone mason. Nine miles distant from this village, are situated the Hygæn Springs, a white sulphur— the water of which is supposed to contain medical properties inferior to none in Virginia. The scenery at these springs is grand; they are situated immediately on the eastern bank of New river, and both opposite and below the springs the rocks present the most majestic appearance: there being several Natural Pillars that rise perpendicularly to the height of from 30 to 200 feet, and natural arches; one pillar is denominated "Pompey's Pillar"—near which is "Cæsar's Arch:" the pillar and arch nearly join. Five miles from these springs, and 10 E. of Parisburg, is situated the Salt Pond, a natural lake. The mountain on which this lake or pond is situated, is supposed to be the highest in Virginia; being one of the spurs, or it might be called, the main Alleghany mountain. The situation of Parisburg is eligible and picturesque; being located at the extremity of a mountain called "Angel's Rest," and which is a continuation of what is further west called "Clinch mountain." From the top of Angel's Rest, is an extensive view of New river and the surrounding country. Newbern, in Montgomery, can be seen at 22 miles distant—and various other places. There is a line of stages running daily through this village from Wythe C. H. to Lewisburg, Greenbrier county.—This line leaves the main western route at Newbern, running from Washington City, to Knoxville, Tenn. There is also a mail from Franklin, and another from Tazewell C. H., running into this place once a week.

Grayson was established by the Legislature in the year 1793, from a portion of the county of Wythe. It is bounded N. by Wythe,—N. E. by Montgomery,—E. by Patrick,—S. by Surry and Ashe counties of N. C.— and W. by Washington. Its mean length is 66? miles, mean breadth 14; and its area 927 square miles. It extends in lat from 36° 33′ to 36° 53′, and in long. from 3° 28′ to 4° 46′ W. of W. C. Grayson is the most eastern of the southern counties of Virginia, which are comprised in the valley of the Ohio river. Great Kanawha rises in Ashe county of N. C. and flows northeastwardly into Grayson, and thence turning eastward about 20 miles along the line of Va. and N. C.; and turning N. N. E. it traverses Grayson, which it leaves by piercing the iron mountain. This county slopes northward, and is drained by innumerable creeks, which flow into the Great Kanawha, which is here called New river. The elevation of Grayson is about 1600 feet above the level of the ocean. Population in 1810, 4,941—in 1820, 5,598—in 1830, 7,675. This county belongs to the 10th judicial circuit and 5th district. Tax paid in 1833, $468 45—in 1834 on lots, $10 54—on land, $232 90—215 slaves, $53 75 —2238 horses, $134 28—8 studs, $31 00—1 coach, $2 00—4 carryalls, $4 50. Total, $468 97.

Greenbrier was formed by the Legislature in 1777, and created from portions of Botetourt and Montgomery. It is bounded N. by Nicholas, and Pocahontas,—E. by Bath. and Alleghany,—S. by Monroe,—and W. by Great Kanawha, which separates it from Logan. Its mean length is 46 miles, mean breadth 32½; and area 1,409 square miles. It extends in lat. from 37° 40′ to 38° 18′ N. and in long. 3° to 4° 3′ W. of W. C. It is principally drained by Greenbrier river, and its tributaries, but from its western border numerous creeks flow northwestwardly into Gauly river, the principal of which is Sewell's creek.* * The following is an extract from memoirs of Indian wars on the western frontier of Virginia, communicated to the Philosophical Society of Virginia, by Charles A. Stuart, Esq. of Augusta Co. About the year 1749, a person who was a citizen of the county of Frederick, and subject to paroxysms of lunacy, when influenced by such fits, usually made excursions into the wilderness, and in his rambles westwardly, fell in on the waters of Greenbrier river. At that time, the country on the western waters were but little known to the English inhabitants of the then colonies of America, being claimed by the French, who had commenced settlements on the Ohio and its waters, west of the Alleghany mountains. The lunatic being surprised to find waters running a different course from any he had before known, returned with the intelligence of his discovery, which did abound with game. This soon excited the enterprize of others. Two men from New England, of the name of Jacob Marlin and Stephen Sewell, took up a residence upon Greenbrier river; but soon disagreeing in sentiment a quarrel occasioned their separation, and Sewell, for the sake of peace, quit their cabin and made his abode in a large hollow tree. In this situation they were found by the late General Andrew Lewis, in the year 1751. Mr. Lewis was appointed agent for a company of grantees, who obtained from the Governor and Council of Virginia, an order for one hundred thousand acres of land lying on the waters of Greenbrier river, —and did, this year, proceed to make surveys to complete the quantity of said granted lands; and finding Marlin and Sewell living in the neighborhood of each other, inquired what could induce them to live separate in a wilderness so distant from the habitations of any other human beings. They informed him that difference of opinion had occasioned their separation, and that they had since enjoyed more tranquility and a better understanding, for Sewell said, that each morning when they arose and Marlin came out of the great house and he from his hollow tree, they saluted each other saying—good morning Mr. Marlin, and good morning Mr. Sewell, so that a good understanding then existed between them; but it did not last long, for Sewell removed about forty miles further west, to a creck that still bears his name. There the Indians found him and killed him. Previous to the year 1775, Mr. Lewis had completed for the grantees, under the order of council, upwards of fifty thousand acres;—and the war then commencing between England and France, nothing further was done in the business until the year 1761, when his majesty issued his proclamation commanding all his subjects within the bounds of the colony of Virginia, who were living, or who had made settlements on the western waters, to remove from them, as the lands were claimed by the Indians, and good policy required that a peaceable understanding should be preserved with them, to prevent hostilities on their part. The order of council was never afterwards carried into effect, or his majesty's consent obtained to confirm it. At the commencement of the revolution, when the state of Virginia began to assume independence, and held a convention in 1776, some efforts were made to have the order of council established under the new order of things then beginning to take place. But it was not confirmed, and commissioners were appointed in 1777, to grant certificates to each individual who had made settlements on the western waters, in the state of Virginia, previous to the year 1768 and since, with preference according to the time of improvements, which certificates gave the holder a right to four, hundred acres for his settlement claim, and the pre-emption of one thousand more, if so much were found clear of prior claims, and the holder chose to accept it. The following year, 1771, Greenbrier was separated from Botetourt county,—and the county took its name from the river, which was so named by old Colonel John Lewis, father to the late General, and one of the grantees under the order of council, who in company with his son Andrew, exploring the country in 1751, entangled himself in a bunch of green briers on the river, and declared he would ever after call the river Greenbrier river. After peace was confirmed between England and France, in the year 1761, the Indians commenced hostilities in 1763, when all the inhabitants in Greenbrier were totally cut off by a party of Indians, headed by the Cornstalk warrior. The chief settlements were on Muddy creek. These Indians, in number about sixty, introduced themselves into the people's houses under the mask of friendship,—and every civility was offered them by the people, providing them victuals and accommodations for their entertainment, when, on a sudden, they killed the men and made prisoners of the women and children. From thence they passed over into the Levels, where some families were collected at the house of Archibald Clendenin, (where the Hon Balard Smith now lives.) There were between fifty and one hundred persons, men, women and children. There the Indians were entertained, as at Muddy creek, in the most hospitable manner. Clendenin having just arrived from a hunt, with three fat elks, they were plentifully feasted. In the mean time an old woman, with a sore leg, was showing her distress to an Indian, and inquiring if he could administer to her relief; he said he thought he could—and drawing his tomahawk, instantly killed her and all the men almost that were in the house. Conrad Yolkom only escaped, by being some distance from the house, when the outcries of the women and children alarmed him. He fled to Jackson's river and alarmed the people, who were unwilling to believe him until the approach of the Indians convinced them. All fled before them; and they pursued on to Carr's creek, in Rockbridge county, where many families were killed and taken by them. At Clendenin's a scene of much cruelty was performed; and a negro woman, who was endeavoring to escape, killed her own child, who was pursuing her crying, lest she might be discovered by its cries. Mis Clendenin did not fail to abuse the Indians with terms of reproach, calling them cowards, &amp;c. although the tomahawk was drawn over her head, with threats of instant death, and the scalp of her husband lashed about her jaws. The prisoners were all taken over to Muddy creek, and a party of Indians retained them there till the return of the others from Carr's creek, when the whole were taken off together. On the day they started from the foot of Keeney's Knob, going over the mountain, Mrs. Clendenin gave her infant child to a prisoner woman to carry, as the prisoners were in the centre of the line with the Indians in front and rear, and she escaped into a thicket and concealed herself until they all passed by. The cries of the child soon made the Indians inquire for the mother, who was missing; and one of them said he would soon bring the cow to her calf. Taking the child by the heels, he beat its brains out against a tree, and throwing it down in the path, all marched over it, till its guts were all trampled out with the horses. She told me she returned that night in the dark, to her own house, a distance of more than ten miles, and covered her husband's corpse with rails, which lay in the yard, where he was killed in endeavoring to escape over the fence, with one of his children in his arms; and then she went into a corn-field, where great fear came upon her, and she imagined she saw a man standing by her, within a few steps. The Indians continued the war till 1764, and with much depredation on the frontier inhabitants, making incursions as far as within a few miles of Staunton. An end, however, was put to the war in the fall of that year, by the march of an army under the command of Colonel Bouquet, a British officer, who assembled, with his regular troops, at Fort Pitt, some companies of militia from Augusta county and other places,—which, I believe, either volunteered their services or were such as were ordered on the frontiers to protect the inhabitants during the war. Colonel Bouquet held a treaty with the Indians somewhere near Muskingum, and the Indians delivered up many prisoners, who returned to their friends, and a peace was concluded, which continued until 1774. It rises in Sewell's mountain (the highest mountain in this county,) and is one of the extreme southern sources of Gauley river. The surface of this county is much broken and in parts mountainous. The most conspicuous is that known by the name of Keeney's Nob, on which is a creek which rises near the top of the mountain, runs west and empties into New river, one mile below Richmond's falls. Keeney's Nob runs parallel with New river. The country here is a wilderness. The mountains are covered with a growth of large timber of various kinds, and are infested with reptiles, such as the rattle snake, copper head, black snake, &amp;c. &amp;c. There is an abundance of deer, wild turkeys, pheasants, wolves, wild cats, panthers, bears, and a variety of small game.—The mean elevation of the farms above the ocean level is at-least 1500 feet. The staples of this county are Indian corn, oats, buckwheat and cattle. Population in 1820, 7,340, and in 1830, 9,006. This county belongs to the 17th judicial circuit and 9th district. Tax paid in 1833, $1719 75 —in 1834 on lots, $49 70—on land, $858 39—644 slaves, $161 00— 4788 horses, $287 28—22 studs, $208 00—21 coaches, $42 50—2 stages, $4 00—11 carryalls, $11 00—10 gigs, $5 10. Total, $1,671 97. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $537 90—in 1833, no commissioners report. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Anthony's Creek, P. O. 254 ms. from W. and 212 N. W. by W. of R. This post office is located in the north eastern part of the county, and is called after the name of a small stream running N. E. and S. W. nearly parallel with the Greenbrier, until it empties into that river, 30 ms. from its source. It rises in small rills on the north side of the Alleghany mountain, and runs along its foot, gradually increasing to the width of about 50 feet at its mouth—in a beautiful well timbered valley. The land is fertile and well adapted to all kinds of grain and grazing. Horses, cattle, &amp;c. are raised in abundance in this valley. There are between 70 and 80 dwelling houses on the different farms, and the principal pursuit of the inhabitants is agriculture, though there are many mechanics, such as tanners, blacksmiths, gunsmiths, carpenters, joiners, cabinet makers, watch makers, boot and shoe makers, &amp;c. There are 2 houses of public worship, (1 Presbyterian and 1 Methodist,) 3 common schools, 1 temperance society, 1 mercantile store, 4 grist and 5 saw mills. The situation of this post office is handsome and eligible, on the main post road leading from the Warm Springs in Bath county; which crosses the Greenbrier near the mouth of Anthony's creek, on a neat and permanent covered free bridge, near 200 feet in length, and which intersects the Kanawha turnpike road 13 ms. west of Lewisburg;—distant 21 ms. from the county seat, and 13 N. E. of the White Sulphur Springs. This valley has the Alleghany mountain on the S. and other hills too steep for cultivation on the north. They afford, however, extensive ranges for stock in summer, and wild game for the hunter is still found. Blue Sulphur Springs, P. O. 234 ms. W. of R. and 276 S. W. by W. of W. C., situated 20 ms. from the White Sulphur Springs, 10 S. W. of Lewisburg, and 18 ms. N. of the Salt Sulphur Springs. They take their rise in a narrow, yet beautiful, and fertile valley, which is terminated a short distance above by lofty mountains. This valley is a branch or arm of a larger one, here thrown out as if to penetrate deeper into the solitude of the mountains, by whose lofty battlements it is almost encircled. These mountains present their towering heads high above the adjacent country, covered with a richly variegated forest, which the timid deer seek for shelter from the eager pursuit of their enemies. From their rocky sides gush limpid springs, which uniting, form a beautiful rivulet that irrigates and fertilizes the bottoms below. It pursues its gentle and meandering line down the valley which widens as the hills recede, until it is lost by its union with another stream of its own name. The mountain scenery is indeed rich and romantic, presenting an almost endless variety, interesting and delightful. Here the painter may find employment in sketching the bold outline of nature's works—the botanist in contemplating the beauties and varieties of the vegetable kingdom—and the philosopher and mineralogist, in speculating upon the unexplored regions of fossil and miseral formations, with which these mountains so richly abound. Within the precincts of the springs stand groves of sugar maple, interspersed with other forest trees, in all 45 the beautiful irregularity of nature; under their luxuriant foilage, is spread a verdant carpet, inviting the weary to rest,—the seekers of health and pleasure to recline, and inhale the pure breeze that passes by, and taste the salubrious fountain that bubbles beneath. Nature has performed her part, and it remains alone for the hand of enterprise and industry, to develope the beauty and utility of this highly favored spot. The proprietors, sensible of its value and advantages, are now engaged in erecting upon it improvements commensurate with the utmost demands of the public. The buildings are planned and commenced upon an extensive scale, uniting elegance, convenience, and durability. The grounds within the precincts of the establishment will be so laid out as to promote the ease and enjoyment of the visiter, and at the same time, add to the convenience and embellishment of the premises. From 20 to 30 thousand dollars will be expended as soon as practicable, and other additional improvements made as the interests of the public may require. The day is not distant, when the Blue Sulphur Springs will be brought into successful competition with any other watering place of fashionable resort in Western Virginia. Dr. Simpkins remarks, "that having practised medicine in the county of Greenbrier for some 9 or 10 years, I have had during that period annual manifestations of the healing powers of the Blue Sulphur water, in the following catalogue of diseases, viz. dyspepsia in its first stage; dyspepsia or indigestion complicated with deranged function of the liver; habitual constipation, arising from a deficiency of healthy bile, from sedentary habits, or from atony, or weakness of the bowels. In the sequel, of Asiatic cholera, I have had reason to believe the Blue Sulphur water to be a powerful restorative." In hemorrhoidal affections it is particularly serviceable. In that endless variety of nervous and hypochondriacal feelings, which have their origin in a deranged state of the digestive and glandular organs, the remedial efficacy of the water, when brought into judicious operation, will insure permanent relief:—also in that family of distempers which have their seat in the skin, the Blue Sulphur water may be regarded as a never failing remedy. Cases of great debility and emaciation of system, produced by a long existence of some local disease, it is peculiarly adapted. In all affections growing out of some perversion in the uterine function;—as hysteria, chlorosis, or green sickness; partial or total suppression of the menstruel secretion, &amp;c., the Blue Sulphur water may be resorted to in full confidence of obtaining speedy relief. From the tried virtues of this medical spring in the list of diseases above enumerated, I think we may correctly infer, that it holds at least three active medicinal qualities in its composition, viz. a tonic quality, which admirably sustains and husbands the debilitated system, while the alimentary canal, and glandular organs, are efficiently operated upon by its cathartic and deobstruent powers. Clintonville, P. O. 231 ms. N. W. of R. and 273 from W., situated on the James and Kanawha turnpike, near the junction of the Warm Spring and old State road, 11 ms. west of Lewisburg, 13 ms. S.

It contains about 50 dwelling houses, 1 Methodist house of worship, 2 common schools, 1 for males and 1 for females, 2 mercantile stores, 2 taverns, 1 tanyard, 1 saddler, and various other mechanics. Population 230 persons; of whom 1 is an attorney, and 2 are regular physicians. There are very extensive sales of stock annually effected in the neighborhood of this village. Hocrman, P. O. 233 ms. from R. and 275 S. W. by W. of W. LEWISBURG P. V. and Seat of Justice, 221 ms. W. of R. and 263 S. W. by W. of W.; in lat. 37° 48′ N. and long. 3° 26′ W. of W. C. This village is situated near the southern border of the county, immediately on the James river and Kanawha turnpike, equi-distant 100 ms. from Charleston, Kanawha, and Staunton, Augusta, 9 ms. west of the White Sulphur, and 12 east of the Blue Sulphur Springs. Besides the ordinary county buildings, it contains 101 dwelling houses, 3 houses of public worship, (1 Baptist, 1 Presbyterian, and 1 Methodist) 1 academy 1 common school, and 3 Sunday s. hools, 6 mercantile stores, 1 printing office, issuing a weekly paper, 2 tanyards, 3 saddlers, 4 blacksmith shops 2 copper smiths and tin plate workers, 3 brick layers, 4 house carpenters 4 tailor shops, 2 cabinet makers, 2 watch and clock makers, 2 wagon makers, and 3 hotels. The situation of this village, is in a healthy, mountainous region. It has been rapidly improving for the last 3 or 4 years, Population about 750 persons; of whom 7 are attorneys, and 3 regular physicians. The western branch of the Court of Appeals sets here, and commences its session the 1st Monday in July, and if business requires may set 90 days. The U. S. District Court sets on the Friday succeeding the 1st Monday of April and September. County Courts are held on the 4th Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery are held on the 10th of May and October, by Judge Taylor Lick Creek, P. O. 236 ms. from R. and 293 N. W. by W. of W., situted near the county line of Fayette. It contains numerous dwelling houses, and several mechanics. Its population is 280. The land on the creek is of good quality, producing well, Indian corn, wheat, rye, oats and potatoes, and table vegetables in abundance. There are 3 grist mills in the vicinity. A large stream of sulphur water is found 5 ms. distant from this P. O. near the mouth of the creek. Maysville, P. O. 224 ms. from R. and 266 S. W. by W. of W. Meadow Dale, P.

W. by W. of W. White Sulphur Springs, P. O. 212 ms. W. of R. and 254 S. W. of W., situated in the eastern part of the county, 9 ms. S. E. by E. of Lewisburg. We regret that the proprietors have not thought proper, to reply to the repeated applications, made to them for a description of this celebrated and delightful watering place. The great beauty of the place, the ex- tensive buildings erected and yet erecting, and always insufficient,—the vast concourse of visiters, the medicinal powers of the waters, &amp;c. are subjects of which a detailed account might have been written, which would have been interesting not only to this state, but to the whole country, which is beginning to appreciate the excellence of these waters. Already there is a vast concourse of strangers, from the north and the south, the east and the west, coming from the din and bustle of the city, or the baneful miasmata of the marshes, to find health and pleasure at the Virginia Springs, among which this shines forth "Ut lund inter minores sideres." It has never been our misfortune to he compelled to seek it for health, but as an agreeable summer retreat, no place can surpass it. We presume the buildings in the approaching summer of 1835, will be sufficient to accommodate 400 persons. Several large and handsome hotels have sprung up in the neighborhood, for the distance of 6 or 7 ms. with the view of merely accomodating, the company, over-flowing from the limited accommodation at the Springs. The General Assembly in the session of 1833-4, granted a charter of incorporation to the proprietors, but we believe the stock has never been taken. The property is now chiefly owned by Mr. Caldwell. The capital authorized by the charter is $500,000, (of which not less than three-fifths are to be held by other than the present proprietors) or 5000 shares at $100 each. "We knew the White Sulphur, when the accommodations were confined, and much unequal to the demand. Those accommodations have rapidly expanded, year after year, but they are still as inadequate as 12 years ago. The multitudes who flock thither for recreation o with the resources of the country and its population, and will continue to increase beyond what would now appear a rational calculation. As a property it is impossible to estimate its worth. Some 10 years ago it was estimated at from 75 to $150,000. It has ascended in speculation to 500,000, 750,000, and $1,000,000. A few years hence, when further improved, this will unquestionably be thought far below the true value; for although it is possible that as good sulphur water may be found, better can never be, and the established fame of the White Sulphur must at all times, keep down destructive competition." HAMPSHIRE. Hampshire was established by the Legislature in 1754, from a portion of Augusta and Frederick. It is bounded by Morgan N. E., Frederick E., Hardy S. and Potomac and Alleghany county of Maryland, N. E. and N. Its mean length is about 33 ms.; mean breadth 30; and area 989 sq. ms. It extends in lat from 1° 28′, to 2° 12′ W. of W. C. A large proportion of the soil is poor, and much that is cultivated, is on steep acclivities. It nevertheless produces an abundance of wheat of the first quality, for a few crops after it is first cleared, and would continue to produce well, were it judiciously cultivated, as gypsum acts powerfully upon it. The high mountains are untillable, but would afford an excellent range for sheep, both as to the quality of mutton and wool which would be produced, could the attention of the inhabitants be turned that way. The people inhabiting the hills and mountains, though poor, are honest and hardy, and independent, living comfortably upon the produce of their own lands. The principal streams are South branch of Potomac, the North branch of Potomac, the main river Potomac, and the great Cacapon. On all of these there are extensive and fertile low grounds. The South branch has long been celebrated for its rich, and inexhaustible bottom lands. In the county of Hardy through which the South branch flows, before it enters Hampshire, the low grounds on this river as regards the feitility, may be styled the garden spot of Virginia, and are not surpassed in natural productiveness by any perhaps in the world. They have been known to be cultivated in Indian corn, in some instances, for 20, 30 or 40 years in succession, with very little dimunition of their product. In Hampshire the low grounds become narrow, with some small change in the quality of the soil, but are estimated at very high prices by the owners. They have sold at the extravagant price of 100 and $150 per Hardy, as high as $300, but those days have past. The bottoms on the North branch are also rich, but inferior to those on the South. On the great Cacapon which flows in a course of 40 ms. and upwards through the county, the low grounds are inferior to those on the North branch. Patterson's creck also flows through the whole breadth of the county, having fine bottom lands on its margin throughout its course. The face of the country here, and in the county of Hardy, give evidence of convulsions and disruptions, which we might suppose took place in a war between rivers and mountains at some remote period, from which it might be infered, that the rich valley on the South branch, had at one time been a lake; that the waters had risen until they had broken over the mountains in different places, and torn for themselves a passage through, quite down to their bases; leaving tremendous precipices of rocks of astonishing height, which overhang the traveller on the road, passing through those breaches on the narrow margin, now formed between the river and the rocks. One of these is to be seen about 4 ms. below the town of Romney, constituting an object of great grandcur and sublimity to the beholder; and what heightens his wonder and curiosity, still more, it appears as if the capricious river not content with the victory it had gained, or the course it had taken: about 3 or 4 ms. below, it breaks through the same mountain again, to the same side on which it had previously flowed, leaving a similar precipice on its opposite side. But one of the most puzzelling curiosities in this county, is what is called the Ice mountain. It appears to be an entire pile of stone from its base to its summit, about the size of building stone, destitute of soil or clay, trees or shrubs, with few exceptions. It is fully exposed to the whole power of the sun's rays for the greatest part of the day, yet throughout the whole of the hottest summer, on any part of this mountain thus exposed to the sun, lumps of ice may be found on turning up the stones to the depth of about a foot, which shews that the mineralogical or chemical composition of the mountain, is such as to preserve ice in hot weather, if not to produce it: but what that composition is, has not yet been ascertained, though it is notorious that the ice may be found as stated. This natural ice house is situated near the North River Mills, and near the old road leading from Romney to Winchester, about 17 ms. from the former,—in the north western section of the county, on the margin of the North branch of the Potomac. The boundary at that place between Virginia and Maryland, are immense fields of bituminous coal, which have lately attracted the attention of capitalists from the cities, who are at this time rapidly purchasing them up, with a view to the great profits which it is contemplated they will yield, when the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal shall reach them. The calculation is no doubt a rational one, when the small expense which it will require to place this coal in the boat, and the facility of carrying it to market on the canal (if it should be made) is considered. Near to these coal fields there are indicacations of iron ore in large quantities, affording the most ample means of competing with England in the cheapness of bar iron for Rail Roads, &amp;c.: for it is well known that where iron is made by stone coal instead of wood coal, and by rolling it out in mills instead of hammering, it can be sold for one half the price which it must cost to make it by charcoal and forge hammers, as is practised now in the United States with few exceptions. There are large deposits of iron ore over the whole country. It is thought to be more abundant in this, than in in the state. Along the great Cacapon, from its source to its mouth, the appearance of large mines of it, is to be seen in almost every ridge. Very little of it has yet been worked, but the greatest part of what has been tried, is found to be of the best quality. In fact for the manufacture of iron, the great Cacapon may become to Virginia, what Juniata has to Pennsylvania, a great source of wealth. The men of wealth on the South branch, and in other parts of the county, have hitherto been so entirely engrossed in fattening beef for market, that they have thought very little of improving any other resource of the country, not even in erecting mills, for manufacturing flour; but it is to be hoped, that the north western turnpike, now making, which passes through the whole length of the country from east to west, will bring its other resources into action which were locked up before by the mountains. The lowest elevation of this county is along the branches of the Potomac, and this exceeds 500 ft. Population in 1820, 10,889—1830, 11,279. It belongs to the 13th judicial circuit, and 7th district. Tax paid in 1833, $2,399 27—in 1834, on lots, $19 01—on land, $1,631 86—703 slaves, $175 75—4,925 horses, $295 50—22 studs. $169 00—6 coaches, $13 00 22 carryalls, $22 00—7 gigs, $5 80. Total, $2,411 92. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $912 14—in 1834, $949 00. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Burlington, P. O. 205 ms. from R. and 126 N. N. W. of Washington City, situated on a small water course, called Patterson's creek. It contains a mercantile store, a house of entertainment, several houses occupied by mechanics, and a house of public worship, free for all denominations. The mail passes and repasses this post office once a week. A new route has been lately established from this place, to Smith's Farm in Alleghany county, Maryland; on which the mail passes to and fro once a week. The north western turnpike from Winchester to the Ohio, passes immediately through this place, having passed through Romney, the county seat, 11 ms. E. Cold Stream Mill and P. O. 172 ms. from R. and 93 N. W. by W. of W. This village is situated 20 ms. N. W. of Winchester, 21 S. E. of Romney, and 2 N. of the Parkersburg and Winchester road. It contains, 12 dwelling houses, 1 Episcopalian, and 1 Presbyterian house of worship, 1 classical school, 1 mercantile store, 1 woollen manufactory, extensive manufacturing flour mill, 2 saw mills, 2 gunsmiths, doing a considerable business annually, 1 cabinet maker, and various other mechanics. Population 68 whites, 2 of whom are physicians, and 12 colored,—total 80. Much timber is carried in boats and rafts from this place, down the Big Cacapon to the Potomac, and thence to various markets. The Cold Stream is one of the best water courses in the state; on it are several mill seats and manufactories; it flows abundantly in the dryest season, and never freezes in winter. It empties into the Cacapon river, about 50 above the woollen factory before mentioned. The bottom and level lands in this neighborhood are fertile, producing corn, wheat oats, rye, &amp;c., and are improved by clover and plaster. The country around is somewhat mountainous, generally high and rocky. Six miles N. of this place is the famous Ice mountain spoken of in the general description of Virginia in the first part of the work. The mountain is situated near North river, and on the north west side of the mountain. By removing the stones for a about a foot below the surface, ice may be had in any quantity in the dryest and hottest season of the year. Dillon's Run, P. O. 179 ms. N. W. of R. and 100 N. W. of W., situated 16 miles E. of Romney, the county seat. Frankfort, P. O. 203 ms. from R. and 124 ms. N. W. by W. of W., situated near the right bank of Patterson's creek, in the northern part of the county. It contains 25 dwelling houses, 1 Episcopalian house of worship, 3 miscellaneous stores, 2 taverns, 1 manufacturing flour mill, 1 tan yard, 1 saddler, 2 blacksmith shops, 1 cooper, 1 wagon maker, 1 hatter, 1 chair maker, and 3 boot and shoe factories. Population 146 whites, including 1 physician, and 13 colored,—total 159. Glencoe, P. O. 170 ms. from R. and 91 N. of W. Glencoe though called a village, is simply a post office, at which is kept a mercantile store of considerable notoriety. It is situated on the road leading from Winchester to Romney, 19 ms. from the former, and 25 from the latter. In the vicinity on the great Cacapon are situated 2 extensive manufacturing flour mills, an iron forge, in great repute, 2 tan yards, several wagon makers, and blacksmith shops; and various other mechanics in the neighborhood. Within 10 ms. of this place are situated the celebrated Capon Springs, which are famed for the medical qualities of their waters. The accommodations are comfortable and convenient, and there are generally in the summer months from 50 to 70 boarders, who resort to these springs for health and pleasure. The country around is extremely rough and mountainous. The great Cacapon at its head, takes the name of Lost river, from the fact that it disappears, and after taking a subterraneous passage for some considerable distance, is seen again. When this stream is high great quantities of lumber are conveyed to Harper's Ferry, Georgetown, Washington City, and Alexandria. Some years since the Cacapon and North river company was created with a view of making these streams navigable. Five miles distant from this place, there is an extensive vineyard, belonging to Gen'l Lockhart, in a flourishing condition, the wine of which is said for flavor and richness, nearly to equal any imported. He manufactured in each of the successive years of 1832-3, from 5 acres, 30 barrels. The different religious denominations in this section are Presbyterians, Baptists and Methodists. Hanging Rock, P. O. 182 ms. from R. and 103 S. W. by W. of W., situated 28 ms. W. of Winchester, and 15 E. of Romney, the county seat. Hanging Rock post office derives its name from a large rock that projects or hangs over the road, passing through a gap of the North river mountain, where the northwestern turnpike road, lately located from Winchester to the Ohio river, now passes. This Rock is situated about a fourth of a mile on the E. side of the North river, a stream navigable for rafts, boats, &amp;c. It empties into great Cacapon, 14 ms. N. E. of this place. The post office was first established near the rock, but has been twice moved,—its present location is 2½ miles west of the rock. In the vicinity there are 2 houses of public worship, (1 Methodist called Hanging Rock Meeting House, the other free for all denominations, called Zion's Church,) 1 manufacturing flour mill, and 1 grist mill. Two miles below the rock, on a small stream emptying into North river, 4 miles above this place, are 2 grist and 1 oil mill, and carding machine. The lands on North river are generally fertile and productive, and those lying between North river and South Branch of Potomac, are mostly broken and hilly, but where well cultivated are tolerably productive. The turnpike crosses 3 considerable mountains, viz. North river, Sandy ridge, and Dillon's mountains. Little Cacapon, river and P. O. 188 ms. from R. and 109 from W. The P. O. is situated 1 mile W. of Little Cacapon river, 14 N. E. of Romney, and 7 E. of Springfield, at the Sulphur Springs, on the Springfield road. The water of this spring is strongly impregnated with minerals, is pleasant to the taste, and is somewhat noted for its salubrious efficacy. At this spring there is a natural mound, composed of rock and earth, about 20 feet in height and 60 in circumference at its base, with the main post road passing on one side, and a small stream of water on the other. This mound invariably attracts the attention of the passing traveller, being unconnected with any other high ground, and loaded with a growth of large timber. There has been lately erected here a house of entertainment. Little Cacapon has its source in the Grassy Lick, on Stoney mountains, in the southwest part of the county, runs northeast 50 miles, and after receiving numerous tributaries, empties into the Potomac river.—This stream was declared a public highway by an act of the Virginia Legislature in 1832, and is navigable for boats, rafts, &amp;c. 20 ms. from its mouth. The soil on this creek is of good quality, producing well wheat, corn, rye, oats, &amp;c. There are 1 manufacturing flour mill, 7 saw and 5 grist mills, located on this stream; and in its vicinity are 3 houses of public worship, (2 Baptist and 1 Presbyterian.) The uplands in the neighborhood are slate soil, and when first cleared produce good wheat, corn, &amp;c. The mountains and hills abound in pine of the best quality. The principal mountains are Spring Gap and Little Capon mountains on the east,—and Town Hill mountain on the west, running parallel with the stream. North River Mills, P. O. 178 ms. from R. and 99 from W. North River Meeting House, P. O. 194 ms. from R. and 115 N. W. by W. of W. Paddytown, P. V. 214 ms. from R. and 135 N. W. by W. of W. This small but romantic village contains 6 dwelling houses, 1 mercantile store, 1 manufacturing flour mill; and there are in the immediate vicinity, 1 forge and furnace. It is situated upon the banks of the North Branch of Potomac river, between Knobley, New Creek and Alleghany mountains, commanding a beautiful prospect of the latter, which lies within one and a half mile distant:—Queen's Point and Slim Bottom Hill. Queen's Point is remarkable for the magnificent aspect, which is here presented to the spectator. This Point overlooks the river, and is upwards of 600 feet high, the extremity or top of which is decorated with a large projecting rock upwards of 100 feet in height. Through this rock which is about 200 feet in width there is a kind of avenue or alley, thro' which visitors generally pass. This point is a place of considerable resort, during the summer season, and derives its name from the circumstance of a traveller by the name of Queen, having attempted to pass by the foot path, which leads around the base of the rock, upon horseback, but the feet of the animal slipping he was precipitated with his rider over the precipice, and both were killed. Slim Bottom Hill is also a place of some resort, and from its novelty deserves to be partially noticed. The most conspicuous part of this place is a large prominent projecting rock which overhangs the river, the height of which is about 90 feet. This rock appears to have been at one time connected with the opposite rock on the Maryland side. This general opinion is derived from their similarity, and the fact of their being so near in contact, the river only separating them. There are several other natural curiosities immediately in the vicinity of this village worthy of notice; amongst others is a cavern or cave, upon the side of Martin's Hill, (another noted point not much short of one thousand feet high,) from whence there flows a very small stream. This stream in this cave during the summer season produces considerable quantities of excellent ice. This remarkable phenomenon can only be solved in the following manner. Its local situation being due north, and the lower mouth being at the base of the hill, and ascending gradually a distance of perhaps 30 or 40 feet below the surface of the earth, nearly to the top of the hill, where it again makes its appearance (though the cavity is rather small to make it practicable for persons to pass through.) It thereby gives the cold northern winds free access, which naturally freezes the water in winter, and the cavity serves as an icehouse, during the summer. There is also a similar cave on the land of Janney's heirs, whence their issues a perpetual breeze which is extremely cold. This spot has a small house built over it and is occupied as a milk house. There is in this vicinity on the lands of J. Singleton, a Salt spring, from which there has been several barrels of good salt manufactured. ROMNEY, P. V. and seat of justice, on the right bank of the South Branch of Potomac, 195 ms. from R. 116 N. N.

E. and is traversed in that direction by the South branch, and sevral other tributaries of the Potomac; with lateral chains of mountains intervening, which also extend in a similar direction with the rivers. The surface is much broken, and for the most part very rocky and sterile; but tracts of excellent land, lie on the streams, and in the mountain vallies. The mean elevation of the arable land, is perhaps 1000 ft. above the ocean. There are some valuable banks of iron ore in this county, among these the one near the Cacapon furnace, about 30 ms. from Winchester, deserves to be mentioned. Population in 1820, 5,700—in 1830, 6,778. This county belongs to the 14th judicial circuit, and 7th district.

Wardensville is situated 28 ms. from Winchester, 18 from Woodstock, and equi distant 26 from the county seats of Hardy and Hampshire. It is destined from its central situation, to become a place of some importance. HARRISON. Harrison was created in 1784, and formed from a portion of Monongalia. It is bounded N. and N. E. by Monongalia, E. by Randolph, S. by Lewis, and W. by Wood and Tyler. Its mean length is 50 ms.; mean breath 22 and area 1100 sq. ms., extending in lat. from 39° 03′, to 39° 35′ N. and in long. from 2° 53′ to 3° 55′ W. of W. C. The Western branch of the Monongahela river, enters the southern border of Harrison, and winding N. N. E. receives from both sides, numerous creeks, which drain the central and most considerable part of this county. The western part however declines westward, and is drained by the sources of Middle Island creek. The surface of the whole county is much broken, but generally fertile. Population in 1820, 10,932—1830, 14,792. It belongs to the 18th judicial circuit, and 9th district. Tax paid in 1833, $1,616 64—in 1834, on lots, $133 21—on land, 1,056 27—339 slaves, $84 75—5,284 horses, $317 04—28 studs, $106 00—11 carryalls, $11 00. Total, $1,708 27.

E. of Clarksburg, on Simpson's creek, a branch of the west fork of the Monongahela river. The location of the north western turnpike road runs through the town of Bridgeport. It contains 20 dwelling houses, 1 house of public worship free for all denominations, 1 common school, 2 houses of entertainment, 1 grist and saw mill, and various mechanics. The situation of this town is high and healthy, in a flourishing and densely settled part of the county, 11 ms. west of Prunty town. It contains 14 families and is improving. CLARKSBURG, P. V. and Seat of Justice, 260 ms. N. W. by W. of R. and 226 from W. This healthy and thriving village is situated above, and S. S. W. of Morgantown, on the right bank of the Monongahela river, near the centre of north western Virginia, at the junction of Elk creek, with the west fork of the Monongahela, about 100 ms. by the post road south of Pittsburg, 250 W. of Baltimore, and 70 E. of the Ohio river. It is a corporate town and well built; containing besides the usual county buildings, 100 dwelling houses, 1 Methodist house of worship, 2 common schools, a temperance, bible and Sunday school society, 9 mercantile stores, a grist and an oil mill, 1 printing office which issues a weekly paper, 1 tanyard, 3 saddlers, and all other mechanics usual or necessary for an inland town. There is a chalybeate spring, whence issues a never failing stream of highly medicinal water. This village stands on a rolling table land, surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills, ranging in distance from a mile, to a few hundred yards. Elk Run meadering through and around the town, adds additional beauty to the scene. Clarksburg is furnished with inexhaustible supplies of coal in its immediate neighborhood; and being situated in the midst of a large and flourishing county, possessed of valuable arable lands and great mineral wealth in its iron, salt, &amp;c. and being near the centre of N. W. Virginia,—it may hope in time to become a place of considerable importance. Its present population is 700 persons, of whom 20 are attorneys, and 4 regular physicians. County Courts are held on the 3d Monday, in every month.—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Duncan holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 3d of May, and October. Hoffsville, P. O. 253 ms. from R. and 236 W. of W. Lewisport, P. V. 290 ms. from R. and 256 from W., situated 35 ms. W. of Clarksburg, and 25 both from Weston and Middlebourn, county seats of Lewis and Tyler, on the main stage road, at the point, at which it crosses Middle Island creek. This creek is a beautiful stream, which empties into the Ohio; it is 75 yards wide, and navigable from its mouth to this place. Lewisport contains 8 dwelling houses, 1 Baptist house of worship, 1 common school, 1 mercantile store, 2 taverns, 1 manufacturing flour mill, and several mechanical establishment. Population 50 persons; of whom 1 is a physician.

The land in the immediate vicinity of this village is level, but that of the surrounding country is somewhat mountainous; but not so precipitous as to preclude its cultivation, to the very summit. The soil is generally good, the bottoms being a heavy soil suited for meadow lands. The hills are generally a loose black soil, and very fertile. The products are wheat, Indian corn, rye, oats, flax, hemp and various kinds of pulse and vegetables. The lands are peculiarly adapted to raising cattle, which is one of the principal staples of this county. Population 61,—the odd one being a slave. The neighborhood is thickly settled, and bids fair to be a thriving country, should a market ever open to this place. The post office has lately been moved from Milford to Lost creek, on the opposite side of the river. New Salem, P. O. 240 ms. W. of W. C. and 274 from R. Prunty Town, P. V. 276 ms. from R. and 209 N.

Population 110. The surrounding country is somewhat broken, but the soil is good, and well adapted to the grazing of cattle; and growing every species of small grain. Shinnston, P. V. 270 ms. from R. and 236 W. of W. C. This village was laid off in the year 1817 by the Rev. Asa Shinn and brothers, and incorporated by act of Assemby the same year. It is situated on the right bank of the West Fork river, on a beautiful plam, containing about 30 acres of land, 15 ft. above high water mark, 8 ms. N. E. of Clarksburg, and 30 S. W. of Morgantown. The improvements are 18 dwelling houses, 1 house of public worship, free for all denominations, 1 common school, 2 miscellaneous stores, 1 waggon maker, 1 smith shop, 1 gun smith, 1 watch maker and silver smith, 3 cabinet makers, 1 saddler, 3 boot and shoe factories, 1 cooper, 1 tailor, 1 grist and 5 saw mills, several house carpenters, and 10 lumber merchants, by whom large quantities of lumber are shipped annually from this place to the different markets on the Ohio river. The West Forkriver at this place, is 350 ft. wide, passes in a gentle current, and is navigable at high water. It empties into the Tygart's Valley river, 14 ms. below this village—the two forming the Monongahela of Virginia and Pennsylvania Steam-boats might come to this place, if there were no obstructing mill dams. The surrounding country is hilly and extremely broken, but exceedingly well timbered with oak, shell bark, hickory, poplars (120 ft. high,) black locust, honey locust, sugar maple, black walnut, butter nut, beach, cotton wood, cypress, sycamore, birch, lynn; and affords an abundance of gensang, snake root, &amp;c. The country around is thickly settled, and the pursuits of the inhabitants are agriculture, grazing, and raising cattle, and furnishing of lumber for the various markets. The neighborhood of Shinnton in geological language would be called a secondary formation, based on calcarious and clay shist rocks, abounding in iron ore, and bituminous coal, the latter unusually abundant,—several strata being disposed one above the other, in the same hill. The strata are usually 10 feet deep, of excellent coal. The substratum of earth is also, generally about 10 ft. deep, composed of a yellow alluminous clay, very suitable for pottery and brick. The super stratum is a rich vegetable mould, about one foot deep, which if well cultivated, produces excellent hemp, flax, maize, wheat, sweet and Irish potatoes. Orchards are nurtured with care and apples celebrated for size and flavor; peaches, plums, pears, pawpaws and persimmons, and blackberries, grow in such abundance that many ships might be loaded with them. The forests abound with nuts and fruits which rear and fatten large quantities of hogs, and reduce the price of pork to 2 cents per pound,—other products are equally cheap. The climate is mild, and the country generally well refreshed with rain during the summer months. In point of health this place has few superiors. Unimproved land is worth one dollar per acre,— improved from three to five dollars, and quarter acre lots in Skinnston sell at fifteen dollars. The village contains 17 families—aggregate population 100 persons; of whom 1 is a physician. JACKSON. Jackson was created by the Legislature in March, 1831, and formed from portions of Mason, Kanawha and Wood. It is bounded N. E. by Wood, E. by Lewis, S. by Kanawha, S. W. by Mason, and N. W. by the Ohio river. Its form is irregular. It lies between 38° 32′ and 39° 12′ N. lat. Its length is 33 ms.; mean breath 24; and area 850 sq. ms. The Ohio washes its north western border for a space of 34 ms. Several large and valuable creeks intersect it. Great Mill creek rises in the southern part of the county, and after pursuing a south easterly course 15 ms. turns to the N., thence to the N. W. and empties into the Ohio, 4 ms. above the corner of the county. Its length is 65 ms., half of which is navigable for boats. Two miles below Ripley on this stream, are situated 1 manufacturing flour mill, 1 saw mill, 1 wool carding and turning machine, a distillery and cabinet maker's shop: a few miles below this, there is another mill. Sandy creek, 8 ms. N. of Great Mill creek, is the next stream in importance; it enters the Ohio in 39° 07′ N. lat. This little creek is inhabited by an industrious and enterprising class of people, who have in the last three years transported nearly $10,000 worth of lumber to market. Pond creek in the northern part of the county is a good sized mill stream, but too small for navigation; the greater part of this stream is in Mason county. It empties into the Ohio in lat. 39° 15′ N. Reedy and Spring creeks rise in this county,—the first pursuing a N. E., the latter a N. course. They pass into Wood county, and after a short course, empty into the Little Kanawha. The West Fork of Little Kanawha flows through this county, for a distance of 10 ms. and affords some excellent sites for water works. Pocotalico rises in this county, and flowing in a south westerly course, it enters Kanawha county, and forms a junction with Little Kanawha river. This county is not mountainous, but may be said to be a mass of hills, the highest of which, are in the eastern side of the county. The soil is, as in many parts of western Virginia, well adapted to grazing. The bottom lands along Mill creek and its branches, are of the first quality,—other creeks also present fine bottoms, and there is much arable land besides that on the water courses. The productions of the county, are Indian corn, wheat, rye, oats, flax, hemp, tobacco, potatoes and other productions usual in the same latitude. The principal exports from the interior part of the county, are cattle and pork;—along the Ohio the people export large quantities of staves, hoop-poles, boats and lumber of every description. The agriculture of the county may be said to be yet in its infancy, however, large quantities of corn, &amp;c. are carried down the Ohio annually, to different markets. Orchards are not numerous, but where they have been planted early and nurtured with care, produce in abundance. This county abounds with the finest of thrifty white oak, both on the bottoms and ridges,—also black oak, hickory, dogwood, sugar maple, poplar, ash, elm, lynn and sycamore, and on many of the ridges groves of yellow pine. The lands along the Ohio river and other streams in this county, are alluvial, being composed of the washings of the higher lands and hills, in which it is no uncommon thing to find large logs, &amp;c. buried a considerable depth below the surface; and the higher level lands along the Ohio river, are generally composed of sand and round gravel, similar to that found in the bed of the river, and commonly lays in waves parallel to the river, which proves that it was once 60 or 70 feet higher than at the present time. There are in some of the northern ranges of hills in this county an abundance of excellent limestone; in some other parts there have been found small veins of mineral coal, and in the vicinity of the C. H. are appearances of salt water. There are in this county 3 mercantile stores, 8 saw mills, 5 grist mills, 1 distillery and 1 carding machine, and 5 tanneries. Population 3,300. It belongs to the 19th judicial circuit and 10th district. Tax paid in 1833, $259 80—in 1834, on lots, $4 36—on land, $134 79—31 slaves, $7 75—972 horses, $58 32—5 studs, $22 00. Total 227 22. No school commissioners report for 1832. Expended in 1833, $113 28. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. RIPLEY, P. V. and Seat of Justice, 350 ms. N. of R. and 341 W. of W., situated in lat. 38° 52′ N., 8 ms. above Wright's mill, and 12 from the Ohio river, on the Great Mill creek, at its confluence with Sycamore creek. It is a flourishing village, although but recently established. From its location in the valley of Mill creek, and its being in a direct line between Charleston, Kanawha, (distant 42 ms.) and Parkersburg, in Wood Co., it is anticipated that it will one day be a place of some trade. At present it contains besides the ordinary county buildings, which are substantially built of brick, 12 dwelling houses, 2 hotels, 1 common school, 1 mercantile store, 1 mill wright, 1 house joiner, 2 smith shops, 1 tanyard, 1 boot and shoe factory, 2 tailors, 1 brick layer and 1 saw mill. Population about 120 persons; of whom 2 are attorneys, and 2 regular physicians. There are within one mile of the C. H. 32 dwelling houses, and 160 inhabitants. County Courts are held on the 4th Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery are held on the 10th of April and September, by Judge Summers. Reeds', P. O. 360 ms. N. W. of R. and 334 W. of W. C., situated 10 ms. N. of Ripley. Wright's Mills, P. O. 315 ms. N. W. by W. of R. and 315 S. W. by W. of W., situated at the falls of Great Mill creek. This place deserves notice from the singular freak which nature has here played. The creek which is generally 80 yards wide, is here contracted to the space of forty-five feet, allowing between two ledges of rock which constitute the banks, to the height of 16 ft. over a bottom of solid rock. Immediately below this narrow passage, the creek widens to its usual size, and the falls commence. The descent is 7 feet in 120 yards. At the lower end of the falls, the creek is 100 yards wide, and affords one of the best harbors ever known in a stream of this size, being about 100 yards in diameter, of a circular form, and on the N. side, protected from ice, &amp;c. by a high point of rocks, projecting a considerable distance into the creek. From this to the Ohio river, the navigation is good during the spring freshets,—a dis- tance of 4 miles- At this place are situated, 1 extensive manufacturing flour mill, 2 saw mills, 1 grist mill, 11 dwelling houses, 3 school houses, 1 mercantile store, and 1 smith shop. Population 55. JEFFERSON. Jefferson was created by the Legislature in 1801, and formed from a portion of Berkley county. It is bounded N. by the Potomac river, which separates it from Washington county, of Maryland,—E. by the Blue Ridge separating it from Loudoun,—S. by Frederick,—and W. by Berkley. Its mean length is 22 ms.; breadth 10; and area 220 sq. ms., extending in lat. from 39° 10′, to 39° 20′ N., and in long from 0° 43′, to 1° 02′ W. of W. C. The Shenandoah river enters this county near its south eastern border, and flowing in a N. E. direction, parallel with the Blue Ridge, it enters the Potomac at Harper's Ferry. The face of this county is rolling but very fertile. Most of the inhabitants are good farmers; and the county is probably as wealthy in proportion to its size as any in the state. The lands have been enhanced in value from one hundred to one hundred and fifty per cent by the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, and the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road, both of which, reach the county at Harper's Ferry; and taken in connection with the Winchester and Harper's Ferry Rail Road, which passes diagonally through the county, the Shenandoah flowing through the eastern portion, and the Potomac along the northern border, afford the citizens as many facilities for transportation as the tide water counties possess. The decline of the county is N. N. E. The water elevation at Harper's Ferry being 182 ft. above tide water, that of the arable soil cannot fall short of 400 ft. This county has been for the most part settled by old Virginia families from the eastern part of the state, and the inhabitants still retain that high chivalrous spirit, and generous hospitality, for which that race was so remarkable in the palmy days of their prosperity. Population in 1810, 11,851,—in 1820, 13,087—in 1830, 12,927. This county belongs to the 13th judicial circuit and 7th district. Tax paid in 1833, $4,963 97—in 1834, on lots, $677 93—land, $2,690 82—2,354 slaves, $588 50—4,308 horses, $258 48—17 studs, $232 00—143 coaches, $326 80—2 stages, $4 00—31 carryalls, $31 00—51 gigs, $38 50. Total, $4,848 08. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $705 26—in 1833, $670 05. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. CHARLESTOWN, P. V. and Seat of Justice, 182 ms. from R. and 60 N. W. of W., situated 10 ms. S. W. by W. of Harper's Ferry, with which it is connected by an excellent turnpike. Besides the usual county buildings, it contains 200 dwelling houses,—a Methodist, Episcopalian, and a Presbyterian house of worship, a branch of the Bank of the Valley, 1 academy and several other schools, 9 mercantile stores, 2 apothecary shops, 1 printing office, from which a weekly paper is issued, 3 tanneries, 3 saddlers, 1 turner, and various other mechanics, and 1 manufacturing flour mill. Its situation is eligible and healthy, and surrounded by a fertile and wealthy country. The Shenandoah Springs, formerly a place of considerable resort, are in the neighborhood of this place. The Winchester and Potomac Rail Road, now in progress, will pass through Charlestown. Population 1,200 persons; of whom 7 are attorneys, and 6 regular physicians. County Courts are held on the 3rd Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, May, August and November. Judge Parker holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 25th of March and 10th of October. Harper's Ferry, P. V. 174 ms. from R. and 52 S. W. by W. of W. This place has risen at the justly celebrated pass of the Potomac through the Blue Ridge, and is situated immediately at the junction of the Potomac and Shenandoah rivers, on the right bank of Potomac, above the mouth of Shenandoah. The level of low water at the junction of the two rivers, is 182 ft. above tide water at Georgetown. It is distant 22 ms. S. W. by W. of Frederick, Maryland, and 25 almost due south of Hagerstown. It contains about 500 houses, 2 hotels kept in the best style, 3 houses of public worship, 1 Methodist, 1 free for all denominations, and 1 Catholic. The last is one of the handsomest and neatest buildings in the state,—in this church, there is a fine toned organ, and it is ornamented by a beautiful steeple, which ascends to the height of about 150 ft. above the level of the river. There are 2 academies, (1 male, and 1 female,) and 2 common schools, 9 mercantile stores and 2 apothecary shops, a lodge of masons, and 1 of odd fellows, 1 printing office, from which a weekly paper is issued, 4 tailors, 3 boot and shoe factories, 1 saddler, 1 silversmith, 1 coppersmith and tin plate worker, 3 house carpenters, 2 smith shops, and 1 wagon maker. There are 2 extensive manufacturing flour mills, and 1 of the most valuable saw mills in the United States. The principal curiosities of the place, are Jefferson's Rock and the Maryland Pinnacle, from the highest point of which, with the aid of a good glass, may be seen towns at the distance of 30 ms. Those great national works, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, and the Baltimore and Ohio Rail Road are now completed to this place, which circumstance has already had a very sensible effect on it, for the better. There are 3 arrivals and departures of the mail to and from the east, and 3 from the west in each week. There is also a mail from Hagerstown, by Harper's Ferry and Leesburg to Washington City, twice a week.— Formerly Harper's Ferry was considered unhealthy, but for the last 5 years it has been quite the reverse. We borrow a more extensive account of the scenery of Harper's Ferry, and the United States Armory and Arsenal, there located, from a periodical published a few years since. "The Shenandoah, after running along the foot of the Blue Ridge in a direction nearly north-east, turns suddenly to the east, and mingles its waters with those of the Potomac, at the point where the latter, after flowing through a deep and well wooded dell, from north-west to south-east, is entering that singular gap in the Ridge, through which the waters escape. The valleys of both rivers are romantic, and that of the Potomac unites singularity with beauty. We are accustomed to find valleys running parallel to mountain chains and separating ridge from ridge; the whole of the great valley, which lies between the North Mountain and the Blue Ridge, and which is called in this part of the country "the valley" par excellence, presents an alternation of such parallel, low lands and intervening heights, the Shenandoah occupying one of the former. But the valley of the Potomac is not of this class, it intersects at right angles the 47 great mountain ranges and the system of smaller elevations which are subordinate to them; and the river is thus distinguished from the more numerous class of streams, which occupy the bottoms of ordinary valleys. The Potomac is not, however, a solitary example of this kind, on the contrary, most of our great Atlantic rivers penetrate the mountains by extensive lateral valleys, or are said, with some degree of impropriety, to break through the mountains at right angles to their direction. These profound passes are not uncommon in other parts of the world, and present several varieties. A deep ravine, in which the rocks, presenting unequal resistance, have separated unequally, and where the stream, which rushes through this accidental outlet, leaps from rock to rock, and is alternately seen foaming in the cataract or lost in the narrow and gloomy gulf below; in short where the waters are not to be regarded as flowing over a bed, but rather as penetrating through crevices, which earthquakes have broken in the immense wall that confined them. Such is the appearance, which theory would assign to these transverse valleys and their streams; but such is not the valley of the Potomac. As seen from Harper's Ferry it presents a bed of nearly uniform declivity and width, corresponding in these respects with that of the Shenandoah, a valley, as I have before observed, of a different class. The channels of both rivers are of rock, much broken, but presenting on the whole a regular declivity, and passing in highly inclined strata across the river. The prevailing rocks of the whole neighborhood being a coarse granite containing unusually large grains of quartz, and a species of slate stone. The breadth of the Potomac is from two hundred and fifty to three hundred yards; that of the Shenandoah, one hundred and fifty. Both rivers are shallow, so shallow that the water leaves innumerable necks bare in every part of the channel, whose sides are worn by thousands of petty rapids, which fret and struggle among the large blocks of granite. The town extends itself in contempt of all order, along both sides of the hill which divides the two rivers, and runs up to the jaws of the picturesque, but in no way tremendous, pass of the Potomac. At the point of this tongue of land is the armory; on the left, and nearly even with the water, the working part of the arsenal: on the right and over hanging the western bank of the Shenandoah, is Jefferson's Rock. On the opposite banks of the two rivers the cliffs are more bold and striking. That, on the Maryland side, is supposed to resemble the profile of Washington, an illusion very pleasing to those whose minds are not adapted to relish the beauties of nature. The two cliffs, of which we have spoken, form a noble entrance to the romantic valley which lies beyond, embosomed among woods and mountains and winding among the projections of the latter until its exit is again guarded by immense rocks, where a passage, corresponding to that at Harper's Ferry, is broken through the Short Hills—a chain parallel to the Blue Ridge, and connected with it by spurs which inclose on every side this dell that contains so many elements of the picturesque. The mountains, of considerable height, are clothed to their summit by forests of oak and pine, from out the thick shade of which, project immense masses of granite, that yet stand the stern witnesses of some tremendous convulsion, the traces of which not even time, that has for thousands of years been scattering their debris daily below, has been able to obliterate. The base of these mountains presents elevated and very rugged cliffs, which, projecting into the valley, break its uniformity, and give a wilder aspect to the river, that spreads itself between them. A greater abundance of water would convert this valley into a singularly wild and beautiful lake, a mirror worthy of the noble objects it would reflect. But the character of the Potomac is the same here as before its waters are united with those of the Shenandoah. A channel, too extended for the stream, presents every where its rugged bed, interspersed with thousands of rills and small pools of water. Yet has this deficient stream, a sublimity of its own; the rugged bed is in unison with the rocks which overhang it, and with the dark and often blasted pines, which clothe them; and if, in awful grandeur, it cannot be compared with the passage of the Rhone through the Alps, or in beauty, with some of the smaller lakes, so abundant in the northern states of our own country, it is yet a most highly impressive scene. Commanding interest from the praise of one whose praise was celebrity, Harper's Ferry seems often to have disappointed foreigners who expected to find a scene as unique as the Natural Bridge, and as sublime as the falls of Niagara. Those who form such extravagant expectations will not have them realised, but the rational admirers of nature will find abundance to admire in the beauty, the grandeur, and the simplicity of the spot. This subject gives us occasion to regret, that the many commanding positions, which our mountains present, should be so little known. The western part of Virginia abounds in romantic scenery, but the traveller may toil for hours in its immediate vicinity, plunged in a depth of shade, that excludes all idea of the beauty by which he is surrounded; to ascend the mountains is difficult, and adds but little to his chance of gratification; the foliage is nearly as thick there as at their base; but the necessary local knowledge would be at the command of all, if those, who annually make summer excursions through our country, were as ardent admirers of nature as they commonly are of Warm Springs or other spots, which draw together a number of half sick, half idle people, who lounge away the best part of the year. As an instance, how many Dr. Syntaxes in search of the picturesque, of the company at the springs, or the wonders of Weyer's Cave, plunge in the interminable shades of Brown's Gap, which brings so forcibly to mind the falsehood of Thomson's lines. I care not fortune what you me deny, You cannot bar me from fair nature's grace, You cannot shut the windows of the sky Through which Aurora shews her smiling face. How many unhappy wights perform this darksome pilgrimage, when they might, a few miles off, from Turk's Gap have seen the sun rise over a landscape, which exhibits the country, towards tide water, spreading out in an extent of forest as boundless and level as the ocean, to the north and south the long chain of the Blue Ridge, to the west the well cultivated valley watered by the Shenandoah, adorned by detached and picturesque mountains, and bounded by the hazy and unbroken line of the North Mountain. To return to Harper's Ferry. The exit of the river at the Short Hills on the Maryland side is called the Point of Rocks; it is here that two rival companies contended for the exclusive right to possess a narrow gorge, which now gives passage at once to a river, a canal, and a Rail Road. A handsome wooden bridge, seven hundred and fifty feet from one abutment to the other, and with a space between the piers of more than one hundred and eighty ft., connects the town with the Maryland shore; whilst the funds for a similar structure over the Shenandoah have already been subscribed.* * This work we believe has since been completed. The former bridge is simple and displays the skill of the engineer; it is sustained by arches formed of three tiers of planks placed edgeways, and whose joints give shift to each other, king posts, fanning from the centre, unite these planks and sustain a roof, which, by its diagonal framing, serves to give stability in a lateral direction. The bridge is double. Did not the name of the engineer, by whom this structure was erected, give sufficient guarantee for its excellence, the observer might fear that economy had been too much consulted in the materials. The national arsenal at Harper's Ferry is an object worthy of attention Eighty or ninety thousand stand of arms are usually kept there, and as these are sent off to other depositaries their place is supplied from the extensive manufactory adjacent. It is interesting to observe the facility with which a weapon, so complicated as the musket, is produced. A bar of iron is forged into a rough tube, the interior of which is formed into a smooth surface by drills turned by the power of water. At first, the barrel, strongly fastened, is moved slowly forward, whilst the drill, a cylindrical rod of iron, terminating in a rectangular bar, ten or twelve inches long, revolves with rapidity, but without progressive motion; the barrel is surrounded by water, which, though constantly renewed, becomes warm to the touch. The barrel is not made cylindrical by a single drill, a succession is employed, until, in the application of the finer drills, the barrel, only fastened in the middle, is left free to adapt itself to the motion of the drill. The outside of the barrel is polished by enormous grindstones, turning with great rapidity. These stones are guarded by thick cheeks of wood, to which is fixed a covering, that lessens the danger, should the centrifugal force, arising from so rapid a motion, burst the stone asunder, and project the pieces forward. The barrel passing through these cheeks, bears against the stone, and is drawn across it with a motion resembling that of a screw. The stocks are shaped by a machine, the idea of which seems to have been borrowed from an admirable contrivance in the celebrated Block Machinery of Brunel. The writer was struck immediately with the resemblance, and, on inquiry, found that the inventor, Blanchard, had previously introduced the use of Brunel's machinery in this country. The reader will readily form a general idea of this machine. Let him imagine two wheels, eight or ten inches in diameter, placed one behind the other, and in the same plane; one of these has a smooth, round edge, the other is furnished with steel cutters, which are parallel to the circumference. Further let him suppose two turning lathes, placed side by side, in the one an iron stock as a guide or pattern, in the other the wooden stock to be turned. Now let him suppose, that, whilst these two stocks are in a rapid rotatory motion, the plane wheel of which we have spoken is made to traverse the whole length of the iron, and is pressed against it by a strong spring; this wheel, it will be remembered, is connected invariably with that which is furnished with cutters: if then the latter be brought into contact with the wooden stock at the moment when the first wheel commences its motion along the pattern, it will perform a similar journey along the wooden stock, and only requires, that it should be kept in a rapid rotatory motion, in order that it may shape, by its cutters, this stock to the form of the iron pattern against which the guiding wheel is pressed. Some contrivance is requisite to provide the rotatory motion, spoken of, in the second wheel, as this wheel moves longitudinally the strap by which it turns, must have a like motion; to effect this it is passed, below, round a large cylinder, in lieu of an ordinary drum wheel, and, being confined above by the sides of the drum over which it passes, shifts itself without difficulty along the cylinder and remains always vertical. This machine will shape a musket stock in about eight seconds. The limits of this article will not permit us to describe the operations by which the minute parts of the muskets are completed. The whole gives employment when in full work to about two hundred and fifty men, and at such times fourteen hundred muskets have been finished in a month. The average cost is about eleven dollars for each musket, and a good workman will earn two dollars a day. About a dozen of the workmen are from England, chiefly from the Armory Mills which were worked during the war near Deptford in Kent. The muskets are lighter, and in this respect preferable to the English; the workmen did not hold the iron, which is chiefly from Massachusetts, in the same esteem. The establishment is governed by a superintendant who receives fourteen hundred dollars a year, and conducted by a master armorer at sixty dollars per month, and four assistants at forty dollars. We must not quit this part of the subject without mentioning Hall's rifle, which is loaded at the breech, and of which there is a separate manufactory here. The barrel is formed of two portions by being cut asunder a few inches from the breech. And, on touching a trigger, placed before the ordinary one, the lower portion is raised out of the stock by a spring, and may be loaded as a pistol. When pressed down again the parts perfectly coincide, and the movable part of the barrel is retained in its place by a catch. Much time is undoubtedly saved in loading a rifle by this contrivance, and it may obviously be done with less chance of exposing the rifleman to a hostile aim. But no inventions are more uncertain as to ultimate effect than those in the art of war. The confusion and violence of warfare forbid the employment of any but the simplest weapons; and it may be doubted whether these divided portions—subject to violence, to rust, to the intrusion of foreign substances between the stock and the lower portion—when elevated, will, after much use, coincide with sufficient accuracy to allow the passage of the ball, even though no great accuracy is required for that purpose. An inconvenience does, however, attend the loading of rifles, a weapon of great importance in American warfare, and the expedient we have described seems the most simple and therefore the best which could be devised to remove it". Lee Town, P. O. 165 ms. from R. and 71 N. W. by W. of W., situated in the western end of the county, 30 ms. W. of Harper's Ferry.

There are 2 turnpikes lead from this village,— 1 to Harper's Ferry, and the other to Shepherdstown. Population 500, including 2 attorneys and 3 regular physicians. Shepherdstown, P. O. 184 ms. from R. and 62 N. W. of W., situated immediately on the west side of the Potomac river, in the north western part of the county. It is a flourishing village, containing 150 dwelling houses, 6 mercantile stores, and all the necessary mechanics for an inland town. There are 4 merchant mills, one of which has an overshot wheel of about 24 feet diameter, and the others of about 20. There is a small stream of considerable fall which runs through the town, immediately opposite to which is an inlet lock, to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. Shepherdstown has 3 houses of public worship, and a population of about 1000. KANAWHA. Kanawha was created by the Legislature in 1789, from a portion of Greenbrier and Montgomery. It is bounded N. by Wood,—N. E. by Lewis,—E. by Nicholas,—S. E. by Fayette,—S. and S. W. by Logan,— W. by Cabell,—and N. W. by Mason and Jackson. Its mean length is 58 miles—mean breadth 36; and area 2,090 square miles; extending in lat. from 37° 53′ to 38° 53′ N. and in long. from 3° 55′ to 4° 25′ W. of W. C. Gauly river unites with New river, to form the Great Kanawha, upon the eastern border of the county. The Kanawha then flows through the county in a N. W. direction into Mason; receiving in its passage Elk river from the N. E.,—Coal river from the S. E., and Pocatalico from the North.—We cannot refrain from giving here a letter from an eminent literary gentleman of this State to his friend in the lower country, which gives agraphic description of the magnificent Valley of the Kanawha. "You have often visited the mountain region of Virginia, and tasted of her various and unrivalled mineral waters. You have mingled with the fashionable throng at the White Sulphur,—regaled your palate upon the fine venison and other dainties of the forest, and bathed in the delicious fountain of the Warm Springs. You have never, I believe, however, extended your journey as far West as the Valley of Kanawha. The great state road which commences at Covington, and secures you a safe passage to Lewisburg, passing the gigantic Alleghanies at a grade which is almost level,—pursues its winding yet steady course over ranges of lofty mountains, and through wild and hitherto unbroken depths of wilderness and shade. Now and then it courses along the margin of some rocky and stupendous precipice, often several hundred if not a thousand feet in depth, —and as the mail coach drawn by four spirited steeds, whirls you along the perilous cliff,—you feel an involuntary shuddering at the slender barrier which separates you from eternity. The blue mist which hovers along the yawning chasm beneath, and is visible through the variegated foilage which obscures without concealing the view,—impresses the mind with undefinable images of danger; and indeed it would be well if the terrors which are sometimes inspired were those of imagination only,—for I have been credibly informed that in more than one instance, the lives of travellers have been exposed to imminent peril. At one of those narrow defiles, the spot was pointed out where the stage with eight passengers and driver rolled down a steep declivity of fifty feet. Fortunately the nature of the ground arrested its downward course, and still more fortunately, I had almost said miraculously, although the luckless vehicle turned two or three somersets and was actually shattered into fragments, neither horse or passenger suffered material injury. Notwithstanding these disasters which occasionally await the traveller, this important and convenient highway which unites the east and west, is a noble monument of skill, enterprise and labor. In its vast utility to the country which it intersects, it may justly be compared to the introduction of steam navigation on our western waters. Distance and time are in a great measure overcome, or perceptibly diminished, and a journey which was once performed with insupportable fatigue and delay, is now achieved in one fourth of the time, and with comparative ease. Before reaching the valley of the Kanawha, the traveller is feasted by the sublime and picturesque scenery from the cliffs of New river, which is one of the principal tributaries to the Kanawha. One of these cliffs has been long known by the name of the Hawk's Nest—but more recently called Marshall's Pillar, in honor of the Venerable Chief Justice who as one of the State Commissioners in 1812, stood in person upon its fearful brink and sounded its exact depth to the river margin. Every one has heard of the far famed falls of Niagara—and yet I doubt if the beholder of that wonderful cataract ever experienced more of the true sublime, than the grand and elevating prospect from Marshall's Pillar, is apt to inspire. Imagine yourself standing upon the projecting point of a perpendicular rock, 1200 feet from the valley below. Before you, as you look to the east, the New river is seen at the distance perhaps of several miles, winding or rather rushing, tumbling and foaming through the towering cliffs which environ it. Sweeping by the lofty promontory on which you stand, it suddenly turns its course in a south west direction, and presents in the whole distance several beautiful cascades, which send to the listening ear the far off, but lulling sound of their waters. The cliffs themselves, judging by the horizontal and corresponding strata of rock on either side, seem to have been originally united, but torn asunder by some strong convulsion of nature, in order to give free passage to the narrow but angry torrent which rolls majestically at their feet. The autumnal season gives to this imposing picture a magnificent and gorgeous drapery of which no man whose vision has been confined to the lowland scenery has the slightest conception. On one side a dark outline is defined by the shadow from the opposite cliffs, which leaving the base of the mountain of a sombre brown, presents its summits shining with the rich and mellow tints of an October sun. In gazing from the dizzy height where the spectator is perched amidst sublime and solitary deserts, it requires but little effort of fancy to portray the haggard and inspired bard of Gray, standing "On a rock whose haughty brow Frowns o'er old Conway's foaming flood." No hostile Edward it is true, is marching through this wilderness with his embattled legions, to victory and slaughter; on the contrary, a profound stillness prevails, which adds interest and solemnity to the scene—a stillness which is disturbed by nothing save the distant wave which seems, but seems only to murmur at the base of the cliff. So sublime indeed is its elevation, that whilst nothing seems easier than to cast a pebble from its beetling verge into the bed of the stream, the most powerful arm is foiled in the attempt. "After feasting on the sublime repasts which nature spreads before the eye of the tourist on these romantic cliffs, he is better prepared to enjoy by contrast his descent into the fertile and lovely vale of the Kanawha. That beautiful stream is formed by the junction of the Gauley and New rivers, at the base of the Gauley mountains. A short distance only below the point where the waters mingle, the ear of the traveller is saluted by the roar of the Great Falls—a fine cataract of twenty-two feet over a natural dam of rock which spreads irregularly across the Kanawha. I should judge from the sketches of the Great Niagara, by artists and picturesque tourists, that this was its copy in miniature. Certain it is, that on approaching the cataract which you can easily do, over the vast masses of naked rock, which rise from the bed of the river—you feel the effect of the spectacle in all its sublimity. I will not say as Byron said of the cascade of Velino, that it is "horribly beautiful"—or that "An Iris sits, midst its infernal surge, Like hope upon a death bed." There is nothing which awakens infernal images in the cataract of Kanawha, but I saw distinctly the rainbow reposing its brilliant arch upon the white foam of the waters. Whatever disappointment, however, the limner might experience in his visit to this interesting spot, the epicure would meet with none at the spacious Hotel which stands opposite the falls. To all lovers of the finny tribe, it is a perfect paradise. Here are fish, which if not unknown, are yet untalked of on the borders of our Atlantic streams. The delicious black perch, the grennel, the blue cat, the fine flavored buffalo, and a species of sturgeon, all abound in profusion, and all present their respective claims to preference. If to these luxuries of the water, be added wild fowl, and forest game, which are found in abundance, the most fastidious gourmand might desire no higher fruition than is afforded in this favored region. For many miles after leaving the falls, the Kanawha Valley is narrow —winding—and unprepossessing. Its gigantic and various growth is indeed interesting to the lowland traveller—and the vast masses of rock which tower in magnificent pride to the very summit of the mountains— are objects of curiosity and attention. At the same period in autumn, nature was perceptibly not so far in the "sear and yellow leaf," as in the more mountainous and elevated region. Her robe was fresher and greener, but yet there was not wanting that splendid variety and intermixture of colors which distinguish the western forests. The bright orange or golden yellow of the linn, the sugar tree and hickory were beautifully contrasted with the evergreen laurel, and with the dark and mournful hemlock. Now and then some parasitical creeper could be seen winding its brilliant red among the branches of a lofty tree of different foliage—and the gay and graceful sumach would hang out its crimson drapery to delight the beholder. Unlike the lowland shrub of the same name, the sumach of the west is admitted into the family of trees; and so I presume it is in England, for otherwise the lines of Moore would not be intelligible. In the shade of yon sumach, whose red berry dips In the gush of the fountain, how sweet to recline. Lovers unless they belonged to the race of pigmies, could hardly recline in the shade of one of our dwarfish sumachs in Eastern Virginia. "It is nearly twenty miles below the falls, before the Kanawha Valley widens into something like a plain, and opens its beautiful vista to the eye. The mountains which inclose it on either side become gradually depressed into hills—and for the first time the dense dark volumes of smoke which ascend from the salt furnaces, announce the busy and bustling scene which enlivens the highway to the village of Charleston. What a scene of animation indeed, contrasted with the deep solitudes from which the traveller has but just emerged.—Here he is feasted with a continued succession of green meadows and cultivated fields teeming with flocks and herds, and adorned by commodious and even elegant mansions. The chimnies of the salt manufactories pour forth at short intervals of space their curling masses of black vapor, whilst swarms of laborers and others connected with these establishments, are continually passing to and fro,—presenting a pleasing coup d'œil of incessant activity and industry.—Nature indeed seems to have been prodigal in her bounties to this interesting region. The contiguous forests having been almost stripped to supply fuel to the salt furnaces,—the precious mineral so necessary to human comfort, must have remained forever useless but for the discovery of inexhaustible beds of coal, so convenient of access, as to make the cost of procuring it scarcely worth considering. Sometimes, by suitable platforms and inclined culverts, it is thrown from the mountain side immediately to the door of the manufactory, and when more remote from the place of consumption, it is transported with equal ease in wagons or cars over rail roads constructed for the purpose. The whole product of the salt district, is estimated at 1,200,000 bushels annually—and this product must continue to swell with the increasing demand, and with the employment of additional capital. It is a curious fact, and worthy of philosophical inquiry, that whilst the salt water is obtained by boring at a depth of from 3 to 500 feet below the bed of the Kanawha, it invariably rises to a level with the river. When the latter is swollen by rains, or the redundant waters of its tributaries,—the saline fluid enclosed in suitable gums on the shore, ascends like the mercury in its tube,—and only falls, when the river is restored to its wonted channel. How this mysterious correspondence is produced, is a problem which remains to be solved. Theories and speculation, I have heard on the subject, but none seem to me to be precisely consonant with the principles of science. Immediately on the road and a short distance from the bank of the river, the celebrated Burning Spring, attracts the curiosity of the traveller. A cavity in the earth of a few feet in diameter, presents at its bottom several small orifices from which an odorous gas, or strong bituminous vapor is constantly exhaled. When ignited by a lighted candle, which is easily done, the whole becomes a sheet of flame, and is only extinguished by the plentiful application of water. Filling the cavity with water previously to ignition, does not diminish the brightness or fierceness of the blaze. Inflammable gasses undoubtedly abound in many portions of the valley. An anecdote illustrating the fact, was frequently related in my hearing, which I cannot forbear to repeat. A very respectable gentleman somewhat eccentric and a little profane, had been boring for salt to the depth of 600 feet, when his friends endeavored to dissuade him from the costly experiment "Salt I will have" he exclaimed, "if I bore for it to the infernal regions!" Accordingly he pressed on in pursuit of his object—with renewed perseverance and ardor—and his boring apparatus having penetrated one of those subterraneous recesses, where nature generates her mysterious and 48 terrific agents—a volume of flame suddenly burst through the orifice, and ascending far above the earth's surface, spread terror and amazement in the neighborhood. The less enlightened and superstitious, of course, fancied that the profane gentleman's threats had been really carried into execution, and that the contents of the awful and undefinable pit had been actually disgorged upon mother earth. "This charming country is not only rich in beautiful and picturesque scenes, but abounds in objects interesting to the naturalist and antiquarian. Besides its inexhaustible treasures of salt and coal, a quarry of fine marble has been recently found on the Elk river, and I doubt not that discoveries equally valuable would reward the diligent explorer. Specimens of slate stone, and other formations with impressions of vegetable remains are common, and a gentleman of science and distinction, informed me that coral had been found deeply imbedded in rock. Among the curiosities, may be mentioned, the Callico and Pictured rocks; the former of which represents a series of beautiful and uniform figures, inscribed by some wonderful process of nature, and the latter which is evidently a work of art, exhibits a variety of rude sketches of birds, fishes and beasts—generally supposed to be specimens of aboriginal sculpture. "There is, as I am informed, some miles from the bank of the Kanawha, a curious petrified tree, and the whole country is full of Indian fortifications and mounds. From one of these ancient sepulchres an intelligent gentleman stated to the writer, that a human skeleton was taken not many years since, probably the remains of some distinguished chief, whose exploits in battle or the chase had won the admiration of his tribe. "Indeed there is no department of natural history which might not be enriched by valuable acquisitions from this and almost every other portion of Western Virginia. The development of its boundless mineral wealth would not only extend the borders of science, but materially subserve the useful arts and the interests of commerce. Let channels of inter-communication with the east be opened and multiplied by a liberal system of improvement—let a geological survey be authorized by the Legislature, in imitation of the wise policy of Pennsylvania and Maryland—and the patriot will not yet despair of beholding this ancient and venerable State regaining her lost rank in the confederacy. "In enjoying the pleasures and advantages of safe transportation along the great State road, which traverses this section, there is a spectacle often presented, which awakens a melancholy train of reflections. I allude to the number of emigrants, who allured by the hope, sometimes deceptive, of improving their condition, are bending their toilsome march to the far west. Imagination becomes busy in conjuring up the broken ties of early association, of kindred and country—and we read in the sorrowful visages of some of these wretched fugitives, tales of mental and bodily suffering, which no language could express. It is true, that some of these numberless caravans present the exterior of comfort and even happiness, but for the most part it is evidently the last struggle of despairing poverty, to escape from the hardships of its lot. Whilst the philanthropist shudders at such scenes of wretchedness, the politician must mourn over the unceasing drain to population, as well as the causes which produce it. I trust, at least, if the wave of emigration must continue to flow westwardly, that the time will shortly come, when the forests and mountains of our own Commonwealth, will present sufficient attractions to break its force, it does not entirely arrest it." Population in 1820, 7,000—1830, 9,326. It belongs to the 19th judicial circuit, and 10th district. Tax paid in 1833, $1,520 23—in 1834 on on lots, $180 34—land, $808 87—1197 slaves, $294 75—2197 horses $131 82—9 studs, $89 00—22 coaches, $51 00—22 carryalls, $22 00 —10 gigs, $6 85.

This natural curiosity is situated in the low grounds of the Great Kanawha river, 7 ms. above the mouth of Elk river, and 67 above that of the Kanawha. The spring is a cavity in the earth of the capacity of 30 or 40 gallons, from which issues constantly a bituminous wapor in so strong a current as to give to the sand about its orifice the motion which it has in a boiling spring. On presenting a lighted candle or torch within 18 inches of the hole, it flames up in a column of 18 inches in diameter, and four or five feet in height, which sometimes burns out within 20 minutes, and at other times has been known to continue three days, and then has been left still burning. The flame is unsteady, of the density of that of burning spirits, and smells like burning pit coal. Water sometimes collects in the bason which is remarkably cold, and is kept in ebullition by the vapor issuing through it. If the vapor be fixed in that state, the water soon becomes so warm that the hand cannot bear it. This with the circumjacent lands was the property of General Washington and of General Lewis. Coalsmouth, P. V. 319 ms. from R. and 368 from W., situated on the south side of the Kanawha river, 12 ms. below the town of Charleston, and at the mouth of Coal river. This little river is about 100 yards wide at its mouth, and does not vary this width for many miles above. It is a beautiful meandering stream, which runs through a romantic valley, without receiving any tributary of any consequence, from the junction of its north east and its west Fork, until it receives Little Coal river from the south. Much trade is carried on by the hardy mountaineers who dwell on the banks of this river, in boats for the carriage of salt, and saw logs, which are brought down in times of freshet, from a distance of an hundred miles. These boats sell on the Kanawha for one dollar, to a dollar and twenty-five cents for each foot in length, and the logs from a dollar to one dollar and fifty cents per log. This money is laid out in goods, with which the enterprising woodsman returns. The obstructions in Coal river prevent its navigation in ordinary seasons. The lower falls of Coal river are situated 5 miles above the mouth,—and 5 miles above these are the upper falls. These falls, from the great water power which they afford at all seasons, will in time become places of considerable importance. A few years hence and this section will become a fine wheat country. It is rapidly filling up with industrious, honest and enterprising people, and soon a plenty of the raw material will be found for manufactories, and if a scarcity of produce should occur by bad crops, the transportation from Ohio by steam boats, costs in comparison but little, and can be brought to any point, not distant three miles from either of the falls. From its local advantages and the tide of immigration, it must in a few years become much of a manufacturing country. On the river Coal is found a great deal of very fine land, and the country is not so mountainous, or the sides so precipitous as to preclude their cultivation. The quantity of game has depreciated considerably within the last 10 years, which is an evidence of the great increase of population; however the industry of the inhabitants furnishes a sufficient quantity of fine venison, and other wild game for the table, and the calculation may be in obtaining for years a reasonable supply for home consumption. Some few years ago the inhabitants made it one of their sources of traffic, but since the enterprise of these hardy sens of the forest has been turned into another channel, they seldom have time, or feel disposed to hunt, except to obtain venison for their own families and the neighborhood. The river affords in season the finest fish. The large black and white perch, the salmon pike, large cat fish, &amp;c &amp;c. The delicious soft shell turtle is abundant, and can be obtained with little trouble, and is by far superior to the sea turtle. The shell is cooked and surpasses the fine green fat turtle, Coal river is fordable four months in the year. At Coalsmouth there is a good tavern, a mercantile store, and 3 private families; about 1 mile from the mouth, down the Kenawha, is a large steam manufacturing mill, a grist and saw mill, a cooper's, a tailor's and blacksmith's shops, and 4 private families. The bottom land about the mouth of Coal is rich, and in extent about a half mile wide. The usual average crop of the farmer is 50 bushels of corn and 25 of wheat to the acre. The country at this point has a grand and beautiful appearance,—the neighborhood is composed of many refined and wealthy families,—some few years back the inhabitants were unrefined, and rude in their manners, but religion and an association with families who immigrated from Eastern Virginia, have made wonderful change in the morals of the people. About a half mile up the river Coal, is a beautiful covered bridge. This bridge is on the turnpike road belonging to the State; below the bridge is a well graduated road, leading to and from the ford, which is seldom for four months in the year more than 12 inches deep, the water passing over a fine sandy bottom. At the bridge is a tavern kept in the best style, a blacksmith shop, a tailor and carpenter shop, a house of public worship, (Methodist,) and 4 private families, with 2 regular physicians. At this place the stage passengers going to and from the west, dine. The post office is kept here, and four mails arrive from different points and are opened at this office—two daily and two three times a week. A portion of the land at this place has lately been laid off in half acre lots, with a view of establishing a town, and some of the lots have already been sold, and many buildings are in progress of erection. A large manufactory is about going into operation, and an extensive and well assorted mercantile store has lately been established, and there is every probability that Coalsmouth in a few years will become a handsome and flourishing village, extending from the bridge to the mouth of Coal river. The immigration to the west through this place is very great, which gives to the farmer an opportunity of disposing of his surplus produce, his wheat can at all times be sold at his door from 62½ to 75 cents per bushel, and the cash paid. Coal river derives its name from the quantity of coal in which it abounds, and that of the finest quality. The resources of this neighborhood and county are incalculable, and to the enterprising man holds out advantages truly flattering. The country is remarkably healthy,—no local disease is attached to the neighborhood. Hansford, P. O. 292 ms. from R. and 333 S. W. by W. of W., situated on the Kanawha turnpike opposite to the mouth of Paint's creek, or as some call it, Yellow river,—21 ms. E. of Charleston, and 14 W. of the Falls of the Great Kanawha. The only houses are a mercantile store, and a house of entertainment. There are in the immediate vicinity 3 miscellaneous stores, 1 Baptist house of worship, and a temperance society. The principal pursuits of the inhabitants are agriculture, and building flat boats to navigate the Kanawha. These boats are generally from 60 to 100 feet in length. KANAWHA C. H. or Charles ton, P. V. and seat of justice, 30 ms. N. W. by W. of R. and 356 from W. This is a beautiful little village, situated on the north bank of the Great Kanawha, at the junction of Elk river, 60 ms. above the junction of the former with the Ohio and 225 ms. W. of Charlottesville. Its principal street extends about a mile on the bank of the Kanawha, and is terminated by the Elk, which flo nearly at right angles into the former stream. Indeed there is something like enchantment in the contrast of this flourishing village, with the wildness and solitude of the same spot, less than 30 years past. The panther and wolf, have been driven from their savage haunts, by the march of civilization and refinement—and where a few scattered log huts once arrested the traveller's eye, he now sees commodious and elegant buildings, the abodes of comfort and even of luxury. The village contains besides the ordinary county buildings, 125 dwelling houses, all presenting a neat and fresh appearance. There are 2 houses of public worship, (1 Presbyterian and 1 Methodist,) a female academy, and an infant school, a Branch of the Bank of Virginia, a masonic lodge and chapter, a bible society, a tract, colonization and sunday school society. There are 13 miscellaneous stores, 3 hotels, 3 smith shops, and 1 tanyard, 2 steam saw mills, and one steam merchant mill. The Kanawha river is here a beautiful sheet of water, more than 300 yards wide and 20 feet deep at low water,—navigable for steamboats. The state turnpike passess through this town, on which there is a line of stages from Washington city and Richmond to Guyandotte, which carries the mail from these two cities in four days and a half. Population about 800 persons; of whom 7 are attorneys, and 3 regular physicians. Charleston is remarkable for the liberality and enterprise of its inhabitants. The hills adjacent abound with fine quarries of sandstone for building, and rich bituminous stone coal, which is the common fuel. County Courts are held on the 2d Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Summers holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 14th of May and October. Kanawha Saline or Terra Salis, P. O. 308 ms. N. W. of R., and 350 N. W. by W. of W. This is a new and small village situated on the northwestern side of the Kanawha river about 6 miles above Charleston, containing dwelling houses, 3 mercantile stores, a Methodist and a Presbyterian house of worship, and 1 hotel. The town is directly connected with the salt trade, and rapidly improving.—A daily mail arrives at this place. Kanawha Salt Works. These valuable works are situated on the Kanawha river, commencing near Charleston, and embracing a distance of 15 miles above, on each side of the river. The salt water is obtained anywhere within that distance, by boring or sinking a shaft, from three to five hundred feet below the bed of the river, through a solid rock, from which it is brought to the surface through the surrounding fresh water, in copper tubes, and is raised to the bank of the river by steam engines, and is thrown into cisterns, whence it is conveyed to the furnaces. There are at present about 60 furnaces, manufacturing about one million two hundred thousand bushels annually, and the quantity is only limited by the demand. The adjacent hills abound with stone coal of a superior quality, which lies in horizontal strata, varying in thickness from 4 to 7 feet. The coal is conveyed from the mines to the furnace on rail roads. There has been for the last year a furnace manufacturing allum salt by steam, which is said to be equal to the imported article. At this furnace 100 bushels of this salt are made per day. Several others are erecting on the same plan, and will soon be in operation. The exports of the salt from these works in 1832, is estimated as being worth to the proprietors $250,000. Seldom has it fallen to the lot of any region of country to possess such inexhaustible sources of mineral wealth on the borders of a fine nevigable river, leading to a region of country which will one day be filled with almost boundless multitudes of people. Pocotalico, P. O. 318 ms. from R. and 253 S. W. of W. Teage's Valley, P. O. 328 ms. from R. and 376 S. W. of W., situated in the western part of the county, 20 ms. W. of Charleston. Walnut Grove, P. O. 330 ms. from R. and 379 S. W. by W. of W., situated in the western part of the county, on the left bank of the Great Kanawha river, 25 ms. below Charleston, and 35 above the confluence of the Kanawha and Ohio. No town has yet been laid out at this place, but a steam saw mill, a mercantile store, wood yard, &amp;c., concentrate a good proportion of business. A steam manufacturing flour mill, and some other manufactories, are about going into operation, which with the advantages that the site derives from the facility of transportation in the surrounding country, the abundance of fine coal and timber in the neighborhood, and the facilities of the navigation, will probably place it among the thriving villages of the west. LEE. Lee Coun was taken from Russell in the year 1792, it is situated 400 hundred miles W. S. W. of Richmond,—bounded N. and W. by the Cumberland mountains, separating it from the State of Kentucky, S. by Tennessee, E. by the county of Scott, and N. E. by the county of Russel. This county is singularly laid out, owing to its lying in Powel's valley, which is narrow: it is of considerable length and quite narrow,—its extent from E. to W. is 85 ms., while its width from N. to S. does not exceed 15 ms., and area 800 sq. ms., extending in lat. 36° 30′ to 37° 06′ and in long. 5° 35′ to 6° 30′ W. of W. C. This county is famous for the richness of the soil, productiveness of the lands, and largeness of the timber; among the growth of which is found the sugar maple, ash, buckeye, poplar, black and white walnut, lynn, black and white oak, maple, elm, cucumber, and beach; all of which grow very large and tall. The land is of a very black, rich soil, well adapted to growing corn, hemp, wheat, rye, oats, Irish potatoes and timothy. This county has many fine and excellent springs of water, breaking out from the base of the mountains, which make their way briskly down the vallies, which are deep and narrow, and consequently afford fine mill seats. The principal mountains are, Powell's mountain, Walden's ridge, the Stone mountain, Little Beach and Big Black. Walden's ridge takes its rise in the N. E. of this county, and runs S. W. into the State of Tennessee; these mountains and ridges are all rich on the N. side, while they are extremely poor on the S. side. The N. sides of the mountains abound with limestone of very hard quality, while the S. sides are covered with free stone. There is a leading small ridge, called the Poor Valley Ridge, which is entirely the reverse of any other in this range of hills and mountains, while the others are all poor,—on the S. side it is very rich and productive, while the N. side of this Ridge is very poor. There is a knob called Stocker's knob in the N. E. part of the county, which is very high, 3 miles long, and at the E. end is a settlement called the Turkey Cove; and at the W. end is a another fine settlement called Yacum Station; these are two as fine settlements as the county affords. There is one other place worthy of notice, found among the mountains of this county, and that is a very high peak, called the Butt of Powell's mountain. The mountain here bends precisely in the form of a horse shoe;—this bend of the mountain forms a most delightful cove of 1½ miles in width, which is as level as a bowling green, and as rich as the delta of the Nile, covered thickly with trees of the largest growth, and the greatest height. "Precisely N. of this high peak called the butt, the north fork of Clinch river takes its rise, and runs through the mountain; this gap through which the creek runs, is one of the most picturesque places in western Virginia. The mountain almost perpendicular on both sides, and covered with huge masses of craggy rocks, that look as though they would tumble from their sandy foundations, and fill the deep valley below, presents to the traveller one of the most striking displays of omnipotent power." On the E. side of this water course, we have one of the most noted salt-petre caves ever known; from which, there has been an immense quantity of salt-petre made. This cave is situated very near the top of Powel's mountain, and may be easily discovered from the valley, where you may see hillocks of the earth, from which the salt-petre has been extracted. There are also large beds of fine iron ore, from which some years ago, there was a small quantity of fine iron made at the iron works, on the north fork of Clinch river, which works has since gone into ruins. There are also other beds of fine iron ore in this county, lying on Martin's creek, from which, there is at this time a quantity of iron made. There are now two forges situated on Martin's creek, which make excellent iron: also two on Indian creek, with one furnace for making castings. The principal water courses, are Powell's river, Walden's creek, Martin's creek, Indian creek and Trading creek. On the waters of this creek, the main road, ascends a considerable ridge, over which there has been a road of very ancient date, as there are at this time, growing in the middle of the bed of the road, trees of the larges growth. The ascension of the ridge by the way of this road, shows that the greatest judgment and care, had been taken in locating and constructing the road. It is supposed that it has been ages since this road was constructed, as the earliest settlers of the county, found it as above described. There are in the country of Lee, 4 Methodist churches, 3 Baptist and 1 Presbyterian. There are 13 Methodist ministers, 6 Baptist ministers regularly ordained, and 2 physicians. The staple of this county is stock, such as beef, pork and horses,—the pork is carried to eastern Virginia, the beef to Pennsylvania and Maryland, and the horses to Virginia, or North Carolina. The merchandize of every description is purchased in Baltimore, or Philadelphia. The people of this county make their own sugar and Molasses, from the sugar tree, which grows in great abundance, on the N. sides of all the mountains and creek bottoms. The tree is of a rough, short bark, spreading top and straight body, some quite white, and others very black. Those which are black have the sweetest water, and are very apt to be pecked very much by a bird of small size, called the sap sucker. The trees are chopped with a small axe, and bored with a small augur or gimblet, and a tube placed in the orifice, through which the water is carried into a small trough, placed for the purpose of catching the water. The tree which is thought to afford a common quantity of water, will, if there is a hard freeze, and a warm day after it, afford 8 gallons of water, which will always make one pound of sugar, if carefully boiled down. The most common mode of boiling is to place the boilers in a small furnace; but this method requires more attention, to prevent the boilers from burning the sugar. There is in Lee county, probably more tree sugar made, than in any other county in the S. W. there being more fine sugar orchards. The precise quantity is not known, but supposed between 5 and 6000 pounds, with a quantity of molasses, which, if put up in vessels will keep and improve from age. Population of Lee in 1830, 4,256—1820, 6,461. It belongs to the fifteenth judicial circuit, and eight district.

W. of W. in lat. 36° 40′ and long. 6° 02′ W. of W. C., situated N. of Powell's river, on one of its branches, 65 ms. N. E. of Knoxville, Tenn. and 60 S. E. by E. of Barboursville, Kty. The site on which this village is located is very uneven; resembling in this respect the general surface of the county. It was laid off in the year 1793. It contains besides the ordinary county buildings, which are handsome, 40 dwelling houses, 1 house of public worship, recently erected and free for all denaminations, 1 common school, 4 miscellaneous stores, 1 tavern, 2 tanners and curriers, 3 saddlers, 1 boot and shoe factory, 3 tailors, 4 smith shops, 1 hatter, 1 wagon maker, and several house carpenters. Population 159 whites; of whom 1 is a resident attorney, and 1 a regular physician,—colored 37. Total 196. This village stands upon a beautiful eminence, between the Stone mountain and Walden's ridge, in Powell's valley, through which flows Powell's river. The scenery which surrounds it, though wild is very pleasing, and especially so when the mountains on both sides are covered with rich verdure. The variety of hills presented by the mighty growth of forest trees rising in succession one above the other on all sides, with here and there an old grey rock jutting from the foliage, or a bank of moss peeping through, and nearly the whole earth beneath covered with luxuriant herbs and flowers, present a scene of rich luxuriant beauty, of which a lowlander, in his level unbroken plains cannot entertain a conception. County Courts are held on the 3rd Monday in every month. Quarterly in March, June, August and November.

LEWIS. Lewis was established by act of Assembly in 1816, and formed from a portion of Harrison county. It is bounded N. by Harrison,—E. by Randolph, S. and S. W. by Kanawha,—S. by Nicholas and W. and N. W. by Wood. Its mean length is 54 ms.; mean breadth 32½; and area 1,754 sq. ms. extending in lat. from 38° 38′ to 39° 12′ N. and in long. from 3° to 4° 17′ W. of W. C. The surface of this county is composed of three inclined plains,—the southern portion inclining westward in the direction of the Little Kanawha, which flows through the county diagonally, from its southeastern to its southwestern angles,—the northeastern portion inclines northward towards the West Fork of the Monongahela river, and Tygart's Valley river, and the northwestern portion inclines to the N. W. in the direction of Middle Island creek. The surface of the county is rocky, hilly, and in some parts mountainous. Population in 1820, 4,247—in 1830, 6,241. It belongs to the 18th judicial circuit and 9th district. Tax paid in 1833, $851 37— in 1834 on lots, $26 59—on land, $431 85—87 slaves, $21 75—2,312 horses, $138 72—15 studs, $71 00. Total $689 91.

W. of R. and 266 from W., situated on Buchannon river, in the eastern part of the county, 15 ms. from Weston, 25 ms. from Beverly, and 30 from Clarksburg, county seats of Randolph and Harrison. Buchannon cannot be called a village, but rather a small settlement, having about 330 scattering dwelling houses, extending along both sides of the river about 25 miles. There are in this settlement 4 houses of public worship, (2 Methodist, 1 Baptist and 1 Presbyterian. No regular schools kept, except in the three winter months. There is 1 bible society, 2 tract and 3 temperance societies. Within the limits mentioned are 2 mercantile stores, 7 country mills, 3 wool carding machines, 1 tanyard, 8 or 10 blacksmith shops, and about the same number of boot and shoe factories, cabinet makers and house carpenters, with 2 wagon makers and various other mechanics. The principal pursuit of the inhabitants is agriculture. This is a fine section of country, and the land tolerably fertile, producing corn, wheat, rye, oats, flax, potatoes, &amp;c. Buchannon river runs nearly a N. course, and empties into Tygart's Valley river. 49 It lies between the Middle Fork a branch of Tygart's Valley river and the Monongahela. The state road passes directly through this settlement. Population 1,250. Bull Town, P. O. 296 ms. from R. and the same distance from W. situated on the Little Kanawha river, about 24 ms. S. W. of Weston.— Though called a village it is simply a post office, and derives its name from the circumstance of a few families of Indians having been once settled on this river (Little Kanawha) about one mile and a quarter below this place, whose head man or chief was called Capt. Bull; and hence the name of Bull Town was given to their little village of wigwams, and the spot on which they lived yet retains the name, although the Indians have abandoned it since about the years 1771-2 or 3. There is now no vestige left on the spot where once their little town stood. The first settlement made at the place by a white man, was in 1800 or 1801, then 15 or 20 ms. from any other inhabitants. It is now occupied as a farm by Mr. John Conrod, his dwelling house being several hundred yards from it. The site on which the village stood is a little eminence projecting from the spur of a ridge into a spacious rich bottom, a part of which was cultivated by the Indians. There is a salt work established here, on a limited scale, called the Bull Town Salt Works. These works manufacture from 15 to 20 bushels of salt per day. This neighborhood is but thinly settled, having only 1 country grist and saw mill at the falls, 2½ ms. above this place. These falls are about 11 or 12 feet, and form a valuable seat for iron works, there being an abundance of iron ore in the immediate vicinity, lying idle for want of capital and enterprize. In the vicinity are 2 tanyards. The mail arrives at this P. O. once a week. Collins' Settlement, P. O. 286 ms. from R. and the same distance from W., situated in the western part of the county. French Creek, P. O. 276 ms. W. of R. and 276 from W. This creek empties into Buchannan river. On the banks of this creek is situated French creek settlement, comprising about 8 ms. square, containing 66 scattering dwelling houses, occupied by an industrious and enterprizing people, who have emigrated from the New England States within the last 15 years. There are 1 house of public worship, (Presbyterian) 1 tanyard, a number of wheelwrights, house carpenters, cabinet makers and joiners, and 1 temperance, 1 tract and 1 bible society. The principal pursuit of the inhabitants is agriculture. This settlement is divided into 5 school districts, where the common branches of English education are taught 6 months in the year. The state of education, being far superior to that which exists in the country adjacent. Population 400. Flat Woods, P.

The neighborhood is thickly settled. The lands are of the best quality with extensive tracts of arable land suitable for meadows, on which large quantities of cattle are grazed and raised for market annually. The surrounding country is hilly, and very productive,—abounding with the best of stone coal, and well timbered with walnut, poplar, sugar maple, beach and white oak. In the vicinity are 3 houses of public worship, 2 Methodist and 1 Baptist, 4 miscellaneous stores, 1 tanyard and various mechanics, and several mills. Leading Creek, P.

Logan was established by act of Assembly in the year 1824, and taken from a portion of Giles, Kanawha, Tazewell and Cabell. It is bounded N. by Kanawha,—N. E. by Fayette,—E. by the Great Flat Top mountain, which separates it from Giles and a part of Tazewell,—S. by Tazewell, W. by Tug Fork of Sandy river, which separates it from Floyd county, Kentucky, and N. W. by Cabell. Its mean length is 66 ms.; mean breadth 44?; and its area 2,930 sq. ms., extending in lat. from 38° 13′, to 37° 10′ N., and in long. from 3° 50′, to 5° 22′ W. of W. C. This county is principally watered by Guyandotte and Little Coal rivers and their tributaries; Guyandotte flowing diagonally from S. E. to N. W. The principal branches of Little Coal that waters the N. W. border, are Pond, Beach and Laurel Forks, having their rise in Huffs' mountain,—those watering the N. E. part of the county, are Clear Fork, Big Fork and Rockcastle creeks, having their rise in Cherry Pond mountain, which separates Logan from Fayette: they empty into the Guyandotte. Elkhorn and Camp creeks have their rise in the Great Flat Top mountain, and after running a considerable distance through the county, empty into Tug Fork, which separates it from Tazewell on the S. W. There are several other creeks of minor importance. This county is generally mountainous and incapable of close settlement. The soil however, is rich, and the climate well adapted to raising sheep; and it will some day be perhaps one of the finest wool growing counties in the United States. The principal exports are ginsang, cattle and peltry in considerable quantities. It contained at the last census 3,681 persons, but since that period a portion has been taken off by the new county of Fayette. It belongs to the 9th judicial circuit and 10th district. Tax paid in 1833, $184 95—in 1834, on lots $8 84—on land, $88 83—63 slaves, $15 75—757 horses $45 52—3 studs, $17 00—1 carryall, $1 00. Total $176 84. No report from school commissioners in 1832.

Marshall was created at the latter part of the session of the General Assembly of 1834-5, whilst this work was in the press. It is formed from the southern part of Ohio county; bounded N. by Ohio county, E. by Pennsylvania, S. by Tyler, and W. by the Ohio river. Its precise limits we have no means of ascertaining. The general description, and its towns, villages, &amp;c. will be given under the head of Ohio county. MASON. Mason was created by Act of Assembly in 1804, and formed from a portion of Kanawha county. It is bounded N. by Wood,—E. by Kanawha,—S. by Cabell,—and W. by the Ohio river, which separates it from Gallia county, in the State of Ohio. Its mean length is 37½ ms.; mean breadth 24¼; and area 904 sq. ms. It extends in lat. from 38° 32′, to 39° 05′ N., and in long. from 4° 22′, to 5° 12′ W. of W. C. The Ohio river bounds this county for 60 ms., and the Great Kanawha flows through its southern part in a N. W. direction. The surface is much broken, but much of the soil is of good quality. Salt water has been found near the Kanawha by sinking wells. Population in 1820, 4,868—1830, 6,534. It belongs to the 9th judicial circuit, and 10th district. Tax paid in 1833, $814 64—in 1834, on lots, $47 66—land, $466 24—433 slaves, $108 25 —1,917 horses, $11 02—10 studs, $55 00—1 coach, $2 00—5 carryalls, $5 00. Total $799 17.

E. part of the county, on the E. bank of the Kanawha river, about 21 ms. from its confluence with the Ohio, and 50 ms. S. E. of Point Pleasant. It contains several dwelling houses, 1 Methodist house of worship, 1 mercantile store and 1 warehouse. It is known as a public landing, and a place of some trade. There is a patent ferry established on the river, on the pendulum and lee board system. Its situation is pleasant and healthy, and eligible on several accounts. The surrounding country is thickly settled, and the business of the neighborhood for the distance of 10 or 15 ms. is done at this place. Hereford's, P. O. 360 ms. N. W. by W. of R. and 390 W. of W. Lane's, P. O. 366 ms. both from W. and R. POINT PLEASANT, P. V. and Seat of Justice, 358 ms. N. W. by W. of R. and 358 S.

Judge Summers holds his Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery on the 16th of April, and September. MONONGALIA. Monongalia was established by act of Assembly in the year 1776, and formed from a portion of the District of West Augusta. It is bounded N. by Green and Fayette counties of Pa.—E. by Preston,—S. E. by Randolph,—S by Harrison,—and W. by Tyler. Its mean length is 33½ miles, mean breadth 21½; and area 721 square miles. It extends in lat. from 39° 17′ to 39° 42′ N. and in long from 2° 39′ to 3° 25′ W. of W. C. The face of the country is generally mountainous and hilly; one-third of the territory of the county, lying upon what is called in this country the "Laurel Hill," it being the last western regular ridge of the Alleghanies; the other two-thirds, or western part of the county, being intersected by hills and vallies. Notwithstanding the mountainousness of the country, the soil is very fertile; producing good crops of all kinds of grain and vegetables common to this latitude. And it is remarkably well timbered, both as to variety and size. The rivers watering this county, are the Monongahela, Cheat, West Fork and Tygart's Valley. The Monongahela is formed by the junction (a few miles below the dividing line between Monongalia and Harrison counties) of the West Fork and Tygart's Valley rivers. It thence flows in a northern direction, through the middle of the county; and passes out at the Pennsylvania line, about two miles above the mouth of Cheat river. It is navigable from its head, in time of freshets, for flat-boats of the largest size. And steam-boats have frequently ascended from Pittsburg to Morgantown, ten miles above the mouth of Cheat. From Pittsburg to Morgantown, the navigation of this river is very easy for steam and flat-boats, and unobstructed, except by low water; and is becoming very considerable. From Morgantown upwards the navigation is more difficult, and can only be effected in times of freshets. The West Fork, which flows but about three miles through this county, is a considerable stream, and is navigable for flat-boats in time of freshets, as high as Clarksburg in Harrison county. The Tygart's Valley although a considerable stream, is only navigable about ten miles; it being obstructed by very high falls. It is part of the dividing line between this county and Harrison, and Randolph. Cheat river has its source near that of Tygart's Valley; and after flowing a northwestern direction, through Randolph, Preston and this county, empties into the Monongahela, two miles below the Pennsylvania line. Although it is a considerable stream, affording nearly as much water as the Monongahela, it is only navigable as high as Jackson's Iron Works, a distance of eight or ten miles. The principal creeks in this county, are Decker's, Whiteday, Prickett's and Threefork creeks, which empty into the Monongahela on the east side, and Dunkard, Indian, Pawpaw and Buffaloe creeks, which empty in one the west side of said river. They all afford many excellent seats for water power, several of which are occupied. The principal exports of this county, are stock, (horses, cattle, hogs and sheep,) iron, lumber and some flour. There are three forges, and three furnaces (and another being erected) in this county; which manufacture very large quantities of iron annually. There is also one nail factory, and several good merchant flour mills. Jackson's Iron Works, on Cheat river, are considered the most valuable in Western Virginia, or perhaps in the western country. There has lately been a salt-well sunk in this county, which promises well. On the road leading from Clarksburg and Beverly, 5 miles from Morgantown, on the plantation of Henry Hamilton, there is a large flat rock about 150 fect long, and 50 wide, with numerous engravings of animals, well executed—Such as panthers of full size,—buffaloe tracks,—horse tracks, deer tracks, turkey tracks, eels, fish, women as large as life, human tracks, otters, beavers, snakes, crows, eagles, wild cats, foxes, wolves, racoons, opossums, bears, elks, &amp;c. &amp;c. This is probably one of the most extensive specimens of the arts of the aborigines, to be found in our country. The Raven's Rock is also worthy of notice.—It is situated on Boothe's creek, about 3½ miles south of Morgantown, and half a mile from the entrance of the creck into the Monongahela river. In this rock there are some strata of coal and of iron; and except in these strata the whole rock is perforated like a pigeon box. This rock is 150 feet high, 40 feet thick at its base and 20 at its top. Population in 1820, 11,060—in 1830, 14,056. It belongs to the 20th judicial circuit, and 10th district. Tax paid in 1833, $1,402 33—in 1834, on lots, $130 46—on land, $775 54—184 slaves, $46 00—5417 horses, $325 02—36 studs, $102 00—3 coaches, $6 00— 5 carryalls, $5 00—3 gigs, $1 50. Total, $1392 52—Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $887 15—in 1833, $870 92. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Barns' Mills, P. O. 296 ms. from R. and 233 N. W. by W. of W.

W. of Morgantown, at the junction of Robert's Run and Dunkard creek 50 ms. from its mouth. This creek empties into the Monongahela river. This village is located immediately on the line dividing the states of Virginia and Pennsylvania, a part of Blacksville being in the counties of Monongalia, Va. and a part in Green co Pa. It contains 11 dwelling houses, 2 mercantile stores, 1 common school, 1 temperance society, 1 tan yard, 1 saddler, and 2 blacksmith shops. Dunkard creek is navigable to this place, and boat building is carried on to some extent.

W. by W. of W. and 203 from R. Middletown, or Polsley's Mills, P. O. 294 ms. from R. and 235 N. W. by W. of W. Middletown was established by act of Assembly January 19th, 1820. It is now a flourishing and healthy village, pleasantly situated on the west bank of the Monongahela, one and a half miles below the junction of Tygart's Valley, and West Fork rivers, where they unite and form the Monongahela river, 22 ms. N. of Clarksburg, 18 S. of Morgantown, 90 S. of Pittsburg, 50 S. of Brownsville, Pa., and 52 ms. E. of the mouth of Fishing creek, and its confluence with the Ohio river. It contains 30 dwelling houses, 2 houses of public worship, (1 Methodist and 1 Piesbyterian,) 1 colonization society, 1 tract, 1 temperance, and 1 humane mission society, and 1 common school, 4 mercantile stores, 1 distillery, 2 taverns, 1 pottery, 3 cabinet makers, 1 chair maker, 1 wheelwright, 1 wagon maker, 1 smith shop, 1 gun smith, 2 boot and shoe factories, 1 saddle and harness maker, 1 brick maker, 2 hatter's shops, 2 saw and 2 grist mills. In the immediate vicinity are 2 carding and fulling mills, 4 saw mills, and 2 manufacturing flour mills. The face of the country is somewhat hilly, in parts very much broken. The soil is generally of a rich loamy clay, producing all the staples common in the middle and northern states—well adapted to grazing and raising of cattle, horses, hogs, &amp;c., large numbers of which are raised for the eastern markets. This section of country holds out innumerable advantages for the establishment of manufactories. The forests abound with the finest timber, and the earth is stored with Iron ore, and the best stone coal. Large quantities of the latter are shipped from this place for the Pittsburg and Cincinnati market, and frequently to New Orleans Population 200 persons, of whom 2 are physicians. MORGANTOWN, P. V. and seat of justice, 293 ms. from R. and 215 N. W. by W. of W. in lat. 39° 40′ N. and long 2° 50′ W. of W. C., situated on an elevated level, on the right bank of the Monongahela, 35 miles below and N. N. E. of Clarksburg, and about 60 south of Pittsburg, Pa. Morgantown is a flourishing and wealthy village, holding out incalculable advantages to the manufacturer and mechanic. Its healthy situation on the bank of the Monongahela river,—the various productions of the country by which it is surrounded,—the inexhaustible coal mines which abound in almost every hill, and the rich and innumerable iron banks which are everywhere to be found in this vicinity are perhaps not to be surpassed in Western Virginia. Besides the ordinary county buildings, it contains 120 dwelling houses, 2 houses of public worship, (1 Methodist and 1 Presbyterian,) and 1 female academy called the "Monongalia Academy," comprising 2 departments—Classical and Preparatory. Its standing fund at interest is $10,000,* * The Trustees of the Monongalia Academy were incorporated by the legislature in 1806. In 1827 or 8 the legislature passed an act authorising said trustees to raise $10,000 by lottery for the benefit of this Academy. This sum was raised, and about one-half of it expended in building a large and commodious brick building. The balance was put out at interest for the benefit of the academy. In 1830 the Legislature passed another act, allowing the trustees to raise $20,000 more by lottery for the same purpose. The scheme has been sold, and it is expected the whole amount of the above sum of $20,000 will be raised in a few years; which added to the balance left of the first lottery, will make an endowment sufficient to render the Monongalia Academy a free school. It is now one of the cheapest and best conducted seminaries of the kind in the United States. and it averages 40 pupils,—size of building 70 feet front, 40 feet deep, 2½ stories high, a handsome and spacious brick build- ing, pleasantly situated;—1 private school (female,) in which are taught the languages, painting, drawing, &amp;c., 2 temperance societies, (1 male and 1 female,) 1 sunday school, 1 bible and 1 colonization society, 1 poor asylum, 7 mercantile stores, 1 apothecary shop, 2 houses of entertainment, 2 manufacturing flour mills, 1 fulling and dying establishment, 1 windmill manufactory, and 1 printing office from which is issued a weekly paper, 2 tan yards, 2 saddlers, 4 boot and shoe factories, 3 wheelwrights, and chair makers, 5 cabinet makers, 1 copper and tin plate worker, 1 red and stone ware manufactory, 4 tailor shops, 3 hat manufactories, 2 gun smiths, 1 wagon maker, 3 smith shops, and 1 plough manufactory. The United States mail passes thro' this village 3 times a week. Population 650 persons; of whom four are resident attorneys, and three regular physicians. The Monongahela river is navigable for small steam boats, (and sometimes those of a larger size) for six months in the year to this place; and if the contemplated improvement goes into operation of cleansing the river, and establishing slack water navigation, by dams and locks, this town and county will at no distant day rank among the most flourishing and prosperous in Virginia. County Courts are held on the 4th Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Fry holds his Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery on the 8th of April and September. Palatine Hill, P. O. 289 ms. from R. and 211 from W.

The general declivity of this county is westward from the summit of the Alleghany mountain. Greenbrier river crosses the northwestern angle of the county, and unites with New river to form the Great Kanawha, at the point at which Giles, Logan, Greenbrier and Monroe all meet. The mouth of Greenbrier river has been found by actual admeasurement, to be 1,333 ft above the level of the ocean, and the county of Monroe being still higher and declining to this point, is probably from 1,400, to 1,700 or 1,800 ft. above the ocean.

Emigration to this neighborhood within the last few years, has been considerable. Peterstown, P. O. 249 ms. from R. and 294 S. W. by W. of W. This village was settled, some 40 years since by Christian Peters, from whom it derives its name, and established as a town by act of Assembly in January 4th, 1804. It is situated on a stream called Rich creek, which takes its rise in Peters' mountain, about 7 ms. above, and passing through the town, discharges its waters, 2 ms. below into New river, at the head of the Great Kanawha, affording one of the most advantageous sites for water power in western Virginia. It contains 20 neat dwelling houses, 1 common school, 1 saw mill, 1 grist mill, and a wool carding machine, 1 mercantile store, 3 tanyards, 1 saddler, 1 blacksmith, 1 gun smith, 1 tailor and 1 wagon maker.

V. 240 ms. from R. and 282 from W. These celebrated waters are situated in lat. 37° 30′ 25″ N., long. 3° 14′ 50″ W. from Washington. They are 38 ms. from the White Sulphur, the same distance from the Sweet Springs, and 16 ms. from the Salt Sulphur. The valley in which they rise is formed by two mountains, running from N. E. to S. W. They receive their name from a deposite of a rich crimson color. This deposite rests on another of white, and is itself of a gelatinous consistence. The water issues from various fissures, in a stratum of soft slate stone, within a space of about 24 by 8 ft. Heretofore they were but partially collected, three-fourths having been permitted to waste; but the present proprietor having, in the autumn of 1833, opened the native stone, and obtained a vast increase in the quantity, has collected them in two fountains of white marble. The temperature of the water is preceisely 54 deg. of Fahr.; it is peculiarly pleasant, though so strongly impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen. Hundreds of persons now living can bear testimony to its extraordinary effects in the cure of pulmonary disease it is therefore superfluous to offer farther evidence of its value in checking that frightful enemy of mankind. We may refer the reader to the work of Dr. Bell on baths and mineral waters, and to a pamphlet lately published on "Consumption and the Red Sulphur waters," by Dr. Huntt, a distinguished physician of Washington City. Invalids are earnestly recommended to read this last little work.* * A short time before the illness of the late Mr. Wirt, the proprietor received from him a letter respecting these waters, and the pamphlet above mentioned, which we here beg leave to subjoin. Washington, Feb. 8, 1834. Dear Sir,— In answer to your letter of the 29th ult I have much pleasure in stating, that I was highly gratified by my excursion to the Red Sulphur Springs last season. It was my first visit to that place, and I was so much pleased with the water, the entertainment and the scenery, that my stay was protracted, with enjoyment, for nearly three weeks. I send you a pamphlet just published in this city, on the virtues of these waters, by which you will see that they are rising into deserved celebrity. The author Doctor Huntt is a distinguished physician here whose opinions are entitled to the utmost respect and confidence, and I hope he will be instrumental in extending the knowledge of these valuable waters. With every wish for your success, I remained dear sir, very respectfully and truly, yours, WM. WIRT. It remains that we should notice its effects in other diseases, and here we must express our astonishment, that physicians have turned to so little account the knowledge of its powers in pulmonary complaints, and in the reduction of arterial action. There can be little doubt that the remarkable influence it exerts in pulmonary complaints is mainly dependant on its sedative quality, and it seems to us strange how it has been overlooked by medical men, that so important a curative principle, could not have been limited to one disease. The writer hazards the opinion that it will be found no less efficicacious, in calming nervous irritability, than in reducing arterial action. He has experienced this effect in his own person, and has witnessed it in others. One of the most remarkable cases of Neuralgia we have ever witnessed was that of Henry Brown, esq. of Lynchburg. He had been afflicted many years in an extraordinary degree, had visited Europe, consulted the most eminent physicians, tried all the other mineral waters in this region, but with little benefit. Last August he visitted these Springs, and was so much pleased with their effects, that he remained until the 1st of January. He regretted not having visited the Red Sulphur some years sooner, and believed, if he had, that in all probability, he would have been entirely restored to health. That these waters are most singularly efficacious in uterine diseases, and in restoring the health of delicate females is a fact too well established, to admit of controversy, and one which we deem it peculiarly important should be known, as these are probably the only mineral waters in Virginia that are suited to such cases. The writer is of opinion, that the tonic property of these waters is consequent on their sedative property.— They do not belong to the ordinary class of tonics; they do indeed, invigorate the stomach in a remarkable manner—a fact which is clearly proved by the rapid increase of weight, many persons gaining from one to two pounds a day for several successive days; but whilst they effect this, they are most usually producing one or two evacuations a day, and acting freely on the kidneys and skin. From what has been said, it may be perceived that we believe the water to be directly sedative, indirectly tonic, alterative, diuretic and diaphoretic. It has been found efficacious in all forms of consumption, scrofula, jaundice and other bilious affections, chronic dysentery and diarrhea, dyspepsia, diseases of the uterus, chronic rheumatism and gout, dropsy, gravel, neuralgia, tremor, syphilis, scurvy, crysipetas, tetter, ring-worm and itch; and it has long been celebrated as a vermifuge. That there are many other diseases, to which its medicinal properties are applicable, there can be little doubt, and we can state one fact highly important, which is, that we have never known it to do a positive injury. If the patient has gone away in a worse condition, it is because the disease had progressed so far as to be incurable, or the failure may be clearly traced to some imprudence on his own part. It is a lamentable fact that many of the persons who visit the Virginia Mineral Springs are altogether ignorant of their properties, and consequently are tempted to make experiments on themselves. Some think that the greatest good is to be derived from the greatest quantity, and therefore use them immoderately. Others think that, as charity hides a multitude of sins; so the water justifies a multitude of indulgencies. They entirely lose sight of the object of which they were in pursuit, after having made some progress towards its attainment; and if, after indulging their appetites, or being guilty of some other imprudence, they relapse to their former condition, they immediately blame the water. The writer has had some experience in the use of the Red Sulphur water, and does not hesitate to say, that in his opinion, its efficacy is impeded by all stimulants. Ardent spirits, strong coffee, strong tea, meat diet, especially at night, should be avoided. The patient should live on a strictly vegetable diet. Milk, maple molasses, cold bread, buckwheat cakes, rice, rye mush, bread-pudding, stewed peaches and various other articles of a similar character are best suited to the action of the water. These combined with its judicious use, moderate exercise, and a calm mind, afford the best prospect of a cure. We are of opinion that most persons should begin with six or eight tumblers a day, and gradually increase to twelve. We believe this quantity to be sufficient, except where it is necessary to act more immediately on the kidneys. In this case we would advise a light supper, and three tumblers of water after getting into bed. Walking exercise is of vast importance in making the water alterative. We would therefore strongly recommend early rising, and as much exercise as can be taken without fatigue. There is frequently a fog in the morning, in these mountain regions, but nothing is to be apprehended from it. It is in fact, almost invariably, the forerunner of a fine day. It is highly important to invalids to lay aside the use of all medicines if possible, but more particularly the use of opium. The latter interferes very much with the action of the water. It may be useful at the commencent, to prepare the system by two or three blue pills, and when the water becomes altogether diuretic, it will be proper to turn it on the bowels, which may be done by a little epsom salts or some other simple medicine. When persons laboring under diarrhea use the water it sometimes happens, that the evacuations become more frequent and acrid, for two or three days. Patients in this situation sometimes think that the water is doing them injury, when, in fact, it is expelling the exciting cause. To such persons we recommend perseverance and caution in diet. There is a singular effect produced by this water which we have never known produced by any other mineral water. About the 10th day, usually, but sometimes much earlier, the patient is taken with a sensation of fullness in the head, he feels indolent and sleepy, and we have even known the pulse to get below the natural standard. We have never seen this symptom productive of any injury; on the contrary experience has proved that it is an unerring omen of amendment. Whenever we hear of this symptom we have strong hopes, that the patient is in a fair way of recovering his health, if he will do justice to himself by perseverance and prudence. Visiters to these waters frequently expect miracles. They suppose that chronic diseases of several years standing should be eradicated in a few days. We have, indeed, sometimes seen wonderful changes take place in a few days, but if a man laboring under an obstinate disease desire permanent benefit, he must give the water time to expel from his system every vestige of the exciting cause. Improvements The proprietor of this property came into possession on the 1st of October, 1832. He has ever since been busily engaged in erecting buildings and making other improvements for the accommodation of visitors. In addition to the spacious hotel erected last year, he is now erecting a range of one story buildings 198 by 24 ft., and a two story building with a double portico, 112 by 30 ft. All the old cabins will be fitted up in a more comfortable manner Cold and warm baths will be provided. Extensive stables and carriage houses are erected and every thing liberally provided which can promote the comfort of the guests. The accommodation will be ample for 250 persons. The establishment is conducted by Major Wm Vass. A tri-weekly line of stages is now running through this place to Newbern in Montgomery county, where it connects with the southwestern line. The roads in this neighborhood are greatly improved, and two companies are incorporated to make a turnpike road from the White Sulphur, to this place, by way of the Salt Sulphur. It is expected that the mail will arrive here daily, next season, in stages. Red Sulphur Seminary—This Institution was opened on the 15th April last. The studies at present pursued are the Ancient Languages and Mathematics. The number of scholars is limited to thirty. When that number is engaged a teacher of Modern Languages will be employed. The advantages possessed by this Institution will readily suggest themselves to the minds of those who have boys to educate. It has the undivided attention of Wm Buike as principal, and James Macauly as assistant. Salt Sulphur Springs, P. O. 216 ms. from R. and 270 from W. The mineral waters known by the name of the Salt Sulphur Springs, rise in Western Virginia, in about 37½° N lat. and 5° long W. of Philadelphia—are distant 25 miles from the White Sulphur, 22 from the Sweet Springs, 16 from the Red Sulphur, and 60 from the Hot and Warm Springs—It is generally acknowledged, that this quarter of the country has its full share of medicinal waters, and in greater variety than any other country of the same extent. The climate, too, during the warmer months, is the best in North America. The thermometer in the months of June, July and August, ranges in the day time from 65° to 80°, and the nights are so refreshingly cool as to permit the delicate to sleep under one, two and three blankets. To judge from one's feelings, the barometer would stand very low in this favored country, and show an uncommonly light air, but they are scarce in this portion of the state, and there happens to be none at the Salt Sulphur Springs at this time. Here, under the blessings of providence, "the blind, the lame and the halt" may venture to hope for relief. The fine, refreshing climate, the cheerful company, passing and repassing from spring to spring—and such a variety of medicinal waters, as the world no where else affords—added to the novelty of mountain scenery, it seems to afford sufficient inducement to entice both the young and old,— the robust, to seek new pleasures, and the infirm man, bowed down by disease, and weary of life, to alleviate his sufferings, and endeavor to repair his shattered constitution. The contrast between winter and summer in this region, is, as may be supposed, very great. During the cold months, as the country is thinly inbabited, all appears desolate and dreary—the hills are covered with snow, and the streams with ice—as soon, though, as the season well justifies it, the prospect becomes more inviting—About the latter part of May and the first of June, the poor victims of disease, from north and south, east and west, are seen in these places to try the healing powers of these natural medicines. Soomafter, the throng is much increased by daily arrivals of gay and fashionable people, looking for amusement or a more genial summer climate than the one they reside in. This time of animation continues until the middle of September, when the visitors mostly leave for their homes.—A few, however, frequently remain much later— these, though, are real sufferers, who seem unwilling to leave as long as there is any thing to hope for. There are two fountains at the Salt Sulphur, each giving out a very different water.—The first one used is distinguished as the Salt Sulphur, and is ornamented with an appropriate building resting on twelve large pillars.—The other spring rises about 600 yards up the ravine, and was discovered about a year since in an attempt to convey some sulphur water in pipes to a bath house.—The laborer in blowing a rock to afford a way for the pipes, opened the spring to his great alarm, as he thought he had struck on the source of the spring from which he was conducting the water. The temperature of the two springs is the same at all seasons of the year (50° fah'r,) and both of them contain a portion of sulphuretted hydrogen.—The Salt Sulphur, too, has soda, it is believed, in an uncombined state—This perhaps is the mineral that acts so happily as a corrective of acid and the oily eructation that attends a diseased stomach. The different waters give a copious precipitate by first adding to them salt of iron, and then precipitating it with carburet of potass—of course the precipitate has been considered a precipitate of iron.—If any reliance can be placed on this indication, the newly discovered fountain will have the rare property of reducing a quick pulse as some few other waters are said to do. The more active ingredients in the Salt Sulphur might interfere with those invalids who would wish to reduce a quick circulation, but with the newly discovered spring, no difficulty of the kind need be apprehended.—On an examination of the country around the waters, the limestone will be found frequently to contain magnesia—the formations, too, are all secondary.— From this circumstance, in all probability, these waters contain magnesia and the newly discovered mineral called sodine so generally found in marine productions.—The proprietors of these waters have themselves a high confidence in them and are becoming more and more solicitous for a correct analasis of them, which will secure to them their entire value and nothing more. This spring is celebrated among all the visiters to the springs for the excellence of the accommodations, and the polite and obliging dispositions of the proprietors. These buildings are very extensive, and still increasing— in the season of 1835, they will probably be able to accommodate 300 persons. Sweet Springs, P. O. 204 ms. W. of R. and 263 S. W. by W. of W. This most ancient of any of the watering places in Va., is situated in the county of Monroe, in a fertile valley of the same name. They are distant 29 ms. from Fincastle, 22 from the Salt Sulphur, 37 from the Red, and 18 from the White Sulphur Springs. The spring, which is so copious, as to turn a mill at the distance of 200 yards from the source, rises at the lower end of a small hollow or valley, from which the ground gradually swells on either side. The houses and cabins, of which a large number have been erected within a year or two, are sufficient to accomdate from 250 to 300 persons. By far the greater number of these cabins are built in rows adjoining each other, though some are delightfully situated among the groves of oak trees. There are two perennial rivulets from the mountains, meandering through the dale, which notonly adds materially to the comfort of the visiters and the cleanliness of the place, but refreshes, enlivens and beautifies the surrounding prospect. Nature indeed has not been sparing in embellishing with her choicest beauties this enchanting spot. Every object that can gratify the eye or please the fancy is here pourtrayed in its brightest colors. The wild scenery of the mountains with the gentle landscapes, the shady groves and arbors, carelessly scattered over this delightful scene, invite the young, and the gay, and the admirers of nature to contemplate her under these charming and picturesque aspects. The spirit of public improvement which has recently so diffused itself among the people of Western Virginia, has greatly facilitated the means of access and conveyance to the different watering places. There is a daily line of stages in the summer running from Fincastle to the Sweet Springs and also from the Salt and White Sulphur. The fine roads, delightful climate and beautiful scenery which is here met with, is a sufficient inducement aside from other considerations, to the low landers for an annual ramble to the mountains. The following description of the medicinal properties of the Sweet Spring waters is taken from Dr. Bell on Baths and Mineral waters. "The water of the spring rises into a large cylindrical reservoir, from opposite sides of which it flows out by small pipes: one conveying water to the bath for the men, the other to that for the ladies. The men's bath is of a quadrangular form surrounded by a wall, and open at the top, it is of tolerable extent and clear, the bottom being of gravel and the water constantly flowing in and as constantly passing out, after it reaches a certain height. The temperature of the Spring 73° fahr., the same as that which in England, by a strange blunder, is called Bristol Hot Wells There is a considerable resemblance between the two in other respects as well in the abundant evolution of carbonic acid gas as in the earthy and saline matters held in solution. In the Virginia Spring however iron has been detected, whereas the Bristol Hot Wells has none in its composition. If we can rely on the rather crude analysis of Bouelle, one quart of the water of the Sweet Spring contains— Saline substances in general, 12 to 15 grains Earthy substances, 18 to 24 grains Iron ½ to 1 grains The saline substances are sulphate of magnesia, muriate of soda, and muriate of line with a little sulphate of lime. The earthy substances consisted of sulphate of lime, a small portion of carbonates of magnesia and lime, with a small portion of silicious earth. The deposition of calcarious matter from the waters as they flow down the meadows is so great as to form a kind of drain of considerable height and thickness at about a mile on the road to the White Sulphur Springs. Few mineral waters have acquired such fashionable and well merited celebrity as the Sweet Springs. The name is calculated to convey erroneous impressions of their taste, which is like a solution of a small quantity of a calcareous or magnesian carbonate. The excess of carbonic acid gives, however, the waters a briskness, productive of a very different effect on the palate from what an imperfect mixture of the earth's would produce. The first effects of this water due to its temperature and gaseous contents, when drunk, are a feeling of warmth at the stomach, with a sensation of fulness at the head and some giddiness. Taken at stated intervals in moderate quantity, it will produce a moisture on the skin and increase the flow of urine. It the stomach be in a good state it gives additional appetite and imparts fresh vigor to the system. The Sweet Spring water is serviceable in the varieties of dyspepsia accompanied by gastrodynia or spasm, with pains occurring at irregular intervals and heart burn—when the extremities are cold and the skin torpid. In secondary debility of the digestive canal, from the exhausting heat of summer, or in chronic diarrhea and dysentery without fever or not sustained by hepatic inflammation, much good will be produced by the internal use of these waters. If much gastric irritation or evident phlogosis of the liver be present with a parched skin and other phenomena of fever: it will be better to premise one or two small bleedings, followed by the use of a blue pill at night, and a tumbler full or two of the water, to which has been added a teaspoon full of epsom salts, or twice the quantity of calcined magnesia early in the morning. The harassing cough to which young persons are occasionally subject and which often has its origin in an enfeebled state of the stomach, or in scrofulous habits from enlargement of the bronchial glands, as also the tussis homoralis of old people, will all be materially benefitted by the use of these waters. The relief afforded in such cases as these has usually given Bristol Hot Wells its reputation in the cure of pulmonary consumption. Females of what are termed a nervous habit of body, who have been enfeebled by protracted confinement, or long nursing their children, deprivation of exercise, and of the enjoyment of fresh air, and who have in addition to these causes of dyspepsia, made excessive use of tea and coffee, spices and condiments, will find their strength and health restored by drinking these waters as well as bathing in the manner to be soon mentioned. Irregularity in the uterine functions will often soon disappear after the restoration of the digestive system to its former energy. As we should have inferred from the excess of carbonic acid and the presence of the earthy carbonates in the water, it is useful in calculous and nephritic complaints. In acute rheumatism the waters with the addition of neutral salts and the use of the bath will be of service. But in chronic rheumatism, in which there have been for a long time stiffness of the joints and cold skin, our chief reliance must be placed on the baths of the Warm and Hot Springs, by or attenuated with the use of the sulphur spring water. The usual times for drinking the waters of the Sweet Springs are early in the morning, between 12 and 1 o'clock or some little time before dinner, and in the evening at tea time. This later period is an improper one except the invalid suffer at the time from spasm of the stomach, or experience a morbid and gnawing sensation of hunger. The use of the bath at the Sweet Springs is adapted to a large number of cases, viz., in which there is a morbid or irregular heat of the surface with some febrile action. The first sensation or immersion in the water is a slight shock, after which the feeling of coolness is refreshing and rather agreeable. We have less hesitation in bathing in water of tepid temperature, as this almost is, than in a cold bath. For common hygienii purposes it is quite safe and reviving, and in disease may be used with considerable freedom, but not to the neglect of those precautions given when I spoke of the cold bath. A more efficacious mode of applying this water to the skin would be by douche—the stream being directed on the region in which the irritation was fixed, and whenever there was augmented heat and fixed pain as over the stomach, or liver, or abdomen generally above the pubis or on the loins and sacrum, also to the joints when the violence of inflammation has not yet subsided nor passed entirely into the chronic state. If the irritation of the stomach forbids the drinking of the water, douching of the epigastrium would form a good preparative for its use in this way. Lumbago with some evening fever chloroies or floar albus, with heat and pain at the loins, would all be benefitted by douching this part. The freedom and advantage with which the bath at the Sweet Springs has been used by aged persons, is evidence of its general safety. The chief points to be attended to are, that the skin shall not be moist or cold with perspiration, nor that there shall be general chill nor the languor that follows excessive muscular action the stomach also should be nearly empty, or at least not actively engaged in its work of digestion. The duration of a bath is usually too long; from five to fifteen minutes will embrace periods adapted to all conditions. Even the more robust ought not to stay in longer than the last mentioned time. UNION, P. V. and seat of justice, 267 ms. S. W. by W. of W. C., and 208 W. of R., in lat. 37° 34′ N. and long. 3° 32′ W. of W. C.,—situated northeastward from Peters' mountain in Greenbrier Valley, about 40 ms. a little W. of N. from Christiansburg. The town of Union is a beautiful little village, in a pleasant and healthy situation. The country around for many miles is a rich and fertile soil, particularly adapted to grass. A vast number of cattle, horses, hogs, &amp;c. are annually fattened in this neighborhood. It contains besides the usual county buildings, which are handsome, 45 dwelling houses, 2 houses of public worship, (1 Methodist and 1 Presbyterian,) 1 common school, 2 houses of public entertainment, 3 mercantile stores, 2 tan yards, and 3 saddlers. The other mechanics are, tailors, boot and shoe makers, blacksmiths, wagon makers, brick layers, &amp;c. &amp;c. This court house is situated 15 ms. west of the top of the Alleghany mountain. Population 400 persons; of whom 1 is a resident attorney, and 2 are regular physicians. County Courts are held on the 3d Monday in every month,—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Brown holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 14th of May and October. MONTGOMERY. Montgomery was created by the Legislature in the year 1777, and formed from Fincastle county. It is bounded N. and N. W. by Giles,— W. and S. W. by Wythe,—S. by the new county of Floyd,—and W. by Franklin. As we are unacquainted with the precise dimensions of Floyd, we shall be compelled to give the dimensions of Montgomery as it stood before the separation. Its mean length was 34 miles, mean breadth 32, and area 1089 sq. ms. Extending in lat. from 30° 43′ to 37° 24′ N. and in long. 3° 04′ to 3° 50′ W. of W. C. The northern portion of this county gives rise to the Roanoke and to Craig's creek, which flow in a N. W. direction into Botetourt. The county occupies a portion of the high plateau or table land between the waters which flow into the Atlantic, and those which flow towards the Mississippi. The mouth of Sinking creek, which enters the Great Kanawha, in Giles county, at the western foot o Walker's mountain, of course below any part of Montgomery, is found 51 from actual measurement, elevated 1,585 feet above tide water in James river. The highest spring tributary to Sinking creek was found to be 2509; we may, therefore, very safely assume as the general elevation of Montgomery from 1,800 to 2,500; or a mean exceeding 2,100 feet, or an equivalent to more than five degrees of latitude. If then we assume 37° as the mean lat. of Montgomery county, the real winter climate will be similar to that on the Atlantic coast in N. lat. 42°. Besides the mountains, the whole face of this county is broken and rocky, yet though so rough and elevated, the streams are bordered with excellent soil. Population of Montgomery as it stood in 1820, 8,733,—1830, 12,306. It belongs to the 6th judicial circuit and 8th district. Tax paid in 1833, $1280 27—in 1834 on lots, $92 19—land, $593 77—975 slaves, $243 75 —3283 horses, $196 98—16 studs, $112 00—10 coaches, $28 25—19 carryalls, $19 00—7 gigs, $3 75. Total, $1,289 69. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $207 44—in 1833, $194 28. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Blacksburg, P. O. 215 ms. W. of R. and 290 S. W. by W. of W., situated in the northern part of the county, 9 ms. northwardly from Christiansburg. It contains 34 dwelling houses, 2 houses of public worship, (1 Methodist and 1 Presbyterian,) 1 common school, 1 sabbath school, and 1 temperance society, 3 tan yards, 2 saddlers, and various other mechanics. Population 150 persons, of whom 1 is a physician. CHRISTIANSBURG, P. V. and county seat, 206 ms. S. W. of R. and 282 S. W. of W. in lat. 37° 08′ N. and long. 3° 24′ W. of W. It contains besides the usual county buildings, 45 dwelling houses, 2 houses of public worship, (1 Methodist and 1 Presbyterian,) 2 common schools, 5 miscellaneous stores, 3 benevolent societies, 2 tanyards, and 2 saddlers. The principal mechanics are 3 boot and shoe factories, 4 tailors, 4 hatters, 1 cabinet maker, 4 tin plate workers. Population, whites 230 persons; of whom 5 are resident attorneys, and 3 regular physicians— colored 105—total 335. County Courts are held on the 1st Monday in every month,—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Brown, holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 22d of May and October. Fotheringay, P. O. 195 ms. from R. and 270 S. W. by W. of W. Goodson, P. O. 221 ms. W. of R. and 299 S. W. of W. La Fayette, P. O. 190 ms. S. W. of R. and 266 from W., situated in the N. E. part of the county, near the foot of the Alleghany mountain on the head waters of the Roanoke, and at the junction of the North and South Forks,—33 ms. from Fincastle, and 7 from the line dividing the counties of Montgomery and Botetourt. This village was established 8 or 10 years since, and is now rapidly progressing, most of its improvements having been made within the last 2 years. It contains 43 dwelling houses, 1 house of public worship, (Methodist,) 2 miscellaneous stores, 1 tavern, 1 extensive manufacturing flour mill, 1 tan yard, 1 cooper's shop, 1 boot and shoe factory, 4 smith shops, and various other mechanics. The soil of its vicinity is productive of Indian corn, wheat and tobacco. Population 103 persons, of whom 1 is a regular physician. Newbern, P. V. 225 ms. from R. and 301 S. W. by W. of W., situated in the western part of the county, 16 ms. S. W. of Christiansburg, and 7 W. of English's Ferry, on the main western stage road from Baltimore to Nashville, Tenn. Its location is high and airy, giving a fine view of the adjacent valleys and neighboring mountains, which present an interesting and romantic scene, and fill the traveller's mind with admiration. It contains 100 houses, 1 house of public worship, (Methodist,) and 1 (Presbyterian) in the immediate vicinity, (used as a school house,) 5 mercantile stores, 2 taverns, 2 saddlers, 1 tan yard, 2 boot and shoe makers, 2 wagon makers, 2 tailors, 2 blacksmith shops, 1 silversmith and jeweller, and 1 milliner and mantua maker. Population 190 persons; of whom 2 are physicians. The face of the country to the N. and N. W. is generally level to the valley of Back creek, a distance of 7 or 8 ms. in width, and between 15 and 20 in length, productive of every kind of grain, but naturally adapted to grass. The S. and S. E. is diversified and uneven, tho' the soil is of good quality and produces well. The staple commodities are beef, pork, grain, hemp, flax, and butter. On the north bank of New river, 1¼ ms. from Newbern, there is a bluff called the Glass Windows, (a great natural curiosity,) presenting to the spectator as magnificent a scene as the Natural Bridge in Rockbridge county. It is a perpendicular rock 500 feet in height, running parallel with the river about 3¾ of a mile, in which there are a number of coves that produce saltpetre in abundance; Another natural curiosity is Peak Knob, about 3 ms. W. of Newbern. It somewhat resembles the Peaks of Otter and rises between 800 and 1000 feet above the bed of Peak creek, and presents the inhabitants with a delightful landscape to a very considerable distance. Around the foot of Peak Knob and on the banks of Peak creek, are a number of mineral springs, the medicinal qualities of which are said to be considerable. MORGAN. Morgan was created by act of Assembly in 1820, from a portion of Hampshire and Berkley counties. It is bounded N. by the Potomac, which separates it from Washington county of Maryland,—E. by Berkley,—S. by Frederick and Hampshire,—and W. by the Potomac, separating it from Alleghany county of Maryland. Its mean length is 22 miles, mean breadth 16; and area 352 sq. ms. It extends in lat. from 39° 22′ to 39° 40′ N. and in long, from 0° 58′ to 1° 25′ W. of W. C. The general slope of this county is N. N. E. in the direction of its two principal streams, the Great Cacapon and Sleepy creek. The surface is much broken and rocky, but there is much good soil upon the streams. Population in 1820, 2,500—1830, 2,094. It belongs to the 13th judicial circuit, and 7th district. Tax paid in 1833, $561 20—in 1834 on lots, $46 61—land, $393 72—91 slaves, $22 75—846 horses, $50 76 —2 studs, $20 00—1 coach, $3 00. Total $536 84. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $162 75—in 1833, $165 83. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. BATH, or Berkley Springs, P. O. and seat of justice, 186 ms. N. N. W. of R. and 93 N. W. by W. of W., situated 8 ms. S. S. W. of Hancocktown, Md., and 45 ms. N. W. by W. of Harper's Ferry. Mr. Jeffer- son in Notes on Virginia, thus speaks of this watering place. "On Potomac river in Berkley co., above the North mountain are medicinal springs. In former years they were much more frequented than those of Augusta or any other. Their powers however are less, the waters weakly mineralised and scarcely warm. They were more visited, because situated in a fertile, plentiful, and populous country, better provided with accommodation, were always so far from the Indians, and nearest to the populous states."—The waters of Bath are now held in high repute, whatever opinion might have been entertained of them in the time at which Mr. Jefferson wrote his Notes on Virginia; and hundreds flock to them every season from Maryland and Pennsylvania. County Courts are held on the 4th Monday in every month:—Quarterly in March, June, September and November. Judge Parker holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 25th of April, and August. Oakland, P. O. 175 ms. from R. and 96 N. W. by W. of W. NICHOLAS. Nicholas was created by act of Assembly in the year 1818, from a portion of the counties of Kanawha, Greenbrier, and Randolph. It is bounded N. by Lewis,—N. E. by Randolph,—E. by Pocahontas,—S. E. and S. by Greenbrier,—S. W. by Fayette,—and W. by Kanawha. Its mean length is 44 miles, mean breadth 32½, and area 1,431 sq. ms. It extends in lat. from 38° 04′ to 38° 43′, and in long. from 3° 18′ to 4° 12′ W. of W. C. Its greatest declination is to the souhwest, in the direction of its two principal streams, Gauley river and Elk river. The former flowing through the southern portion of the county, the latter through the northern. Gauley is a rough stream, admitting of but little navigation. Elk on the contrary is a beautiful flowing stream, navigable almost to its source, and susceptible of being made at a small expense, the channel of valuable trade. It is well stocked with fine fresh water fish, some of which are of enormous size. The soil and climate of this county present great variety; being in some parts very warm and very fertile, in others cold and barren. Population in 1820, 1,853—in 1830, 3,349. It belongs to the 18th judicial circuit, and 9th district. Tax paid in 1833, $263 01—in 1834, on lots, $11 98—land, $199 19—53 slaves, $13 25—899 horses, $53 94—4 studs, $25 00. Total, $303 36. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $179 80—in 1833, $65 83. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Birch River, P. O. 284 ms. from R. and 327 S. W. of W., situated in the northern part of the county, 17 ms. N. W. of the county seat. Mountain Cove, P. O. 273 ms. from R. and 315 W. of W. NICHOLAS C.H. or SUMMERVILLE, P. O. and county seat, 286 ms. N. W. by W. of R. and 310 W. of W., in lat. 38° 18′ N. and long. 3° 48′ W. of W. C. This village is situated on a flat at the head of Peter's creek, and Arbuckles' branch. The water rises from a flat near the town and flows east and west, constituting westwardly the head of Peter's creek, and eastwardly the water flows into Arbuckle's branch, both of which streams empty into Gauley river, many miles apart. The village contains a frame court house, a clerk's office, and jail of hewn stone, of superior elegance and durability, 20 dwelling houses, 2 miscellaneous stores, 2 taverns, 1 tan yard, 2 smith shops, 1 hatter, 1 house joiner, 2 tailors, and 1 boot and shoe maker. Population 100 persons; of whom 2 are resident attorneys. There is no physician here, and there are only 2 in the county. County Courts are held on the 2d Tuesday in every month;—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Duncan holds his Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery on the 6th of April and September. Suttonsville, P. O. 300 ms. N. W. by W. of R. and 312 S. W. by W. of W., situated in the southern part of the county, on the south side of Big Elk river, distant 100 ms. from the head of Elk, and from its junction with the Great Kanawha river. Elk is navigable to the Union Mills, 10 ms. above Suttonsville, which may be considered the head of good navition. The situation of this village is eligible, being situated at the intersection of the main northern and southern mail routes, passing through the vallies of Kanawha and Ohio. It contains 8 dwelling houses, 2 miscellaneous stores, 1 house of entertainment, and 1 tanyard. Population 45. The principal pursuits of the inhabitants are building flat bottomed boats which are run down to the Kanawha salines, and freighted off with salt to the various markets in the western country. There are a considerable number of valuable grist and saw mills on this river, which prepare large quantities of plank, lumber, &amp;c., for boat building, and for the Charleston market on the Great Kanawha. There are also great quantities of boat gunwales, barrel-staves, and hoop-poles, carried from this place to the Kanawha salines. There are at this time about 15 saw mills built and building on Big Elk and its tributary waters, a part of which are expected to go into operation this season, and many others are in operation on that part of Big Elk river which runs through Kanawha county. It will give some idea of the business done at this place and its immediate vicinity, and of its fast increasing trade, to state that in the spring of 1833, there were sent off at one time in boats, lumber, &amp;c., to the amount of from 10 to 12,000 dollars. This was the product of about six months labor, including the winter season. This section of country is but thinly and newly settled, with the exception of a few hunters, who are not generally very enterprising people. Its remote situation has kept its natural advantages and facilities out of view until lately. It is now improving, and promises fair to become a flourishing and prosperous village. OHIO. Ohio county was created by act of Assembly in the year 1776, from a portion of the District of West Augusta. It is bounded N. by Brooke,— N. E. by Washington county, Pa.—S. E. by Greene county, Pa.—S. by Tyler county, Va.—S. W. by the Ohio river, which separates it from Monroe county, Ohio,—and N. W. by Belmont county, Ohio. It will be perceived that these limits include the new county of Marshall, created from the Southern portion of Ohio, at the session of the Legislature of 1834-5. Indeed as the law has not yet been promulgated which established this new county it will be impossible to separate them, and we shall speak of Ohio county as it stood in December, 1834. Its mean length is 28¾ miles, mean breadth 13; and area 375 square miles. It extends in lat. from 39° 42′ to 40° 14′ N. and in long. from 3° 36′ to 3° 55′ W. of W. C. The declivity is N. W. towards the Ohio river. Several creeks which rise in Pa. flow N. W. to the Ohio through this county;—they are—Fishing,—Fish,— Grave,—Wheeling, and Short.—The surface is very much broken, but the soil very fertile, especially on the water courses. Population in 1820, 9,182—in 1830, 15,590. It belongs to the 20th judicial circuit and 10th district. Tax paid in 1833, $2630 17—in 1834, on lots, $1385 46—land, $820 33—183 slaves, $45 75—4291 horses, $257 46—23 studs, $190 00—40 coaches, $97 25—13 carryalls, $14 50 —12 gigs, $8 50—Total $2819 25. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $520 06—in 1833, $842 61. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Archville, P. O. 263 ms. from W. and 353 from R. Beeler's Station, P. O. 350 ms. N. W. of R. and 259 N. W. by W. of W.—situated in the southern part of the county—the present county of Marshall. Grave Creek, or Elizabethtown, P. V. 356 ms. from R. and 260 N. W. by W. of W.—situated 12 ms. below Wheeling. This creek and village take their name from very extensive tumuli, scattered over an elevated bottom or plain. The author of this article visited this plain twice in 1794, before the use of the plough or other farming utensils had much disturbed the remains. At that epoch one very large conical mound, surrounded by a ditch, was itself environed by numerous and similar, though smaller, tumuli. The remains of the roads, sloping down the banks from the plain, was also perfectly distinguishable, as was the trench of a work in form of a parallelogram. Triadelphia, P. O. 364 ms. from R. and 255 from W. West Union, P. O. 344 ms. from R. and 266 S. W. by W. of W.— Situated on Wheeling creek, 14 miles S. E. by E. of Wheeling, on an advantageous and beautiful eminence, and on the post road leading from Morgantown, Monongalia county, to Wheeling. It contains 7 dwelling houses, 2 houses of public worship, (1 Methodist, and 1 Presbyterian,) 1 common school, 2 taverns, 1 general store, 2 blacksmith shops, 1 tanyard, and 1 tailor's shop. Population 25. West Liberty, P. O. 276 ms. N. W. by W. of W. and 369 from R. This village is situated in a healthy and flourishing neighborhood, densely settled, five miles from the Ohio river, twelve miles N. E. of Wheeling, and nine S. of Wellsburg, the county seat of Brooke. It contains 40 dwelling houses, 2 houses of public worship, (1 Presbyterian, and 1 Methodist,) 1 academy and 2 common schools, 3 mercantile stores, 2 tanyards, 2 saddlers, 1 hatter, 2 blacksmith shops, 2 tailors, 1 coach maker, and several house carpenters, cabinet makers, &amp;c. 1 printing office, from which a weekly paper is issued. There are within the circle of 3 ms. around this village, 6 manufacturing flour mills. The soil of the surrounding neighborhood is productive, and one of the best wheat and wool growing countries west of the mountains. Population 280 persons; of whom 2 are regular physicians. WHEELING CITY, seat of justice, 357 ms. from R. and 264 W. of W. C. in lat. 40° 07′ N. and long. 4° 36′ W. of W. C.—situated on the left bank of the Ohio river, and at the mouth of a creek of the same name, 56 ms. S. W. of Pittsburg and 31 S. W. by W. of Washington, in Pa.— The origin of this place was Wheeling fort, built early in the Revolutionary war, which stood on the breast of a high bank, at the point of which, the U. S. road reaches the Ohio river. Wheeling advanced at first but slowly. It was laid out as a village early in 1783, and in 1820 contained 1,567 inhabitants. Within the last thirteen years the advance has been rapid,— in 1830 the population was 5,222, and now, 1834, is estimated at 8,000,— among whom are 14 resident attorneys, 12 regular physicians, and 11 clergymen. It contains about 500 houses, 9 houses of public worship, (2 Presbyterian, 1 Episcopalian, 2 Methodist, 1 Catholic, 1 Friends or Quakers, 1 regular Baptist, and 1 Campbellite, &amp;c. There are a number of very excellent institutions here. 1st. The Wheeling Institute, contains 4 departments, viz.—infant—primary—classical, and female—under the superintendence of six teachers, and contains from 150 to 160 pupils. 2d. The Wheeling Lancasterian Academy. 3d. The Wheeling Classical Academy 4th. The Wheeling Female Seminary. 5th. The Wheeling University, (not yet organized,) and nine common English preparatory schools. The rear of this town is skirted by a range of hills which approaches within a short distance of the river These hills, which abound with inexhaustible quantities of stone coal, from their proximity to the town are of the greatest convenience to the numerous manufactories;—a number of them having coal within a few yards of their fires. This place is one of the first manufacturing towns in the western country, and ranks, in point of population, the fourth in the state. There are at all times not less than 26 steam engines in operation. The Wheeling Iron Works, owned by Messrs Shanberger &amp; Agnew, roll 1000 tons of iron annually—about 300 tons of which are cut into nails of various sizes—the balance being bar, boiler, sheet, hoop iron, &amp;c.— giving employment to a great number of hands, and consuming 150,000 bushels of stone coal annually. These works are calculated to produce double or treble the quantity prannum, if there were a demand for it. There are also 4 iron foundries, employing 70 hands, &amp; consuming about 130,000 bushels of coal annually, 4 steam engine builders, giving employment to 70 hands and consuming 60,000 bushels of stone coal annually— 5 glass houses and 2 glass cutting establishments—giving employment to 193 hands, and consuming 260,000 bushels of stone coal, 3 steam flour mills, consuming 75,000 bushels per annum, 1 brewery, 2 steam distilleries, consuming 50,000 bushels, 2 cotton factories, 2 woollen factories and carding machines, consuming 70,000 bushels, 2 paper mills, 70,000 bushels, 2 steam saw mills, 50,000 bushels, 1 copperas, 1 white and 1 sheet lead factory, consuming 8,000 bushels of stone coal annually. There are 2 tobacco factories and 1 glue factory, 1 coach and wagon maker, 1 edge tool maker, 3 chair makers, 1 comb maker, 2 merchant tailors, giving employment to a great number of hands, 4 silversmiths, 18 blacksmiths, and 3 white smiths, 2 steam planing machines, 3 tanners and curriers, 5 saddlers, 17 boot and shoe factories, 6 painters and glaziers, 3 cabinet makers, 3 coppersmiths and tin plate workers, 5 hatters, 2 wire workers, 2 coopers, 1 rope maker, 2 water pump manufactories, 2 soap and tallow chandleries, 10 bake houses, 5 livery stables, 1 stone and earthen pottery, 7 brick yards, 12 master stone and brick masons, 5 stone cutters, 6 plasterers, 7 carpenters and undertakers, 1 book bindery, 1 brass foundry, 3 window glass and hollow ware manufactories, consuming 175,000 bushels of coal annually, 3 printing offices, (2 issuing a weekly, and 1 a tri weekly paper,) 1 book and job office, 2 book stores, 1 reading room, and a very extensive circulating library, 12 apothecaries' shops, 1 Lyceum, a Masonic Hall and Theatre. The aggregate number of manufactories in the town of Wheeling for domestic goods are 113, using annually upwards of 1,000,000 bushels of coal, and giving employment to more than 1,300 hands. There are 65 wholesale and retail stores, vending annually goods to the amount of $1,500,000, 7 commission and forwarding houses, for the sale of goods consigned, and for receiving and forwarding merchandize and produce. These houses, from Nov'r 1832, to Nov'r 1833, forwarded to Baltimore and the District of Columbia, by wagons, 2,671 hogsheads of tobacco, and by steam, keel and flat boats, to the west and south, and by wagons to Baltimore and Philadelphia, merchandize and produce equal to at least 11,000 tons. During the same period there was paid to wagoners for carriage on goods from the eastern cities, and to boats for freights, via the river, a sum variously estimated at from $230 to $250,000. The amount of money expended for the purchase of merino wool exported during the past season cannot be exactly ascertained, but it is known that a sum exceeding $104,500 was so invested for pork, lard and bacon 130 to $140,000, flour 550 to $600,000, whiskey, cider, apples, &amp;c. 50 to $60,000, flat boats to transport the same 70 to $80,000, stone coal, say 1,000,000 bushels, $30,000, flat boats to transport the same, 15 to $20,000. There is owned in Wheeling, in whole and in part, from 17 to 20 steam boats, worth from 200 to $230,000. The arrivals and departures of steam boats at and from this port during the past year were, 738. Wheeling is by a law of Congress a port of entry, so that goods from any port of Europe may be imported direct without payment of duties at New Orleans. There is now running to and from Wheeling eight lines of daily stages, east, west and north—1 tri-weekly line, 1 semi-weekly and 1 weekly. The number of passengers arriving and departing weekly by steam boats and stages are variously estimated at from 350 to 400.—The Baltimore and Ohio wagon transportation company with a capital of $200,000 (one-fourth of which is paid in) transports goods and produce between Wheeling and Baltimore. One wagon arrives and departs daily at and from each of those places, with a load weighing from 2¼ to 2½ tons and occupies 8 days upon the road. Arrangements are in progress to increase the number of daily arrivals and departures from one to three wagons, and eventually to five. There are now within a circle of 25 miles around Wheeling, 134 manufacturing flour mills, making annually at least 270,000 barrels of flour, worth say $823,500—of this quantity, from 150,000 to 160,000 bbls are exported by boats to New Orleans, or by wagons across the mountains.— The public water works are now nearly completed, worked by a steam engine of 120 horse power; and it possesses the capacity to raise       gallons of water from the Ohio river per hour. These, together with the erection of public stone wharves, sewers, &amp;c. &amp;c. of the most permanent kind, cost the corporation within the last 2 years an expenditure of upwards of $40,000. A stone bridge has lately been erected over Wheeling creek at this place, at a cost of $17,000.—Boat building for the last few years has been carried on here extensively. At low water, steam boats ascend no higher than this place. From the fact of its having a more permanent navigation the whole year round than any other point, it is made the general route of travellers. It also possesses one of the finest markets in the western country. The Baltimore and Ohio rail-road it is supposed will strike the Ohio river at this place. Considering all these advantages, there remains no doubt that in the course of a few years Wheeling will become one of the most important places in the west. The northwestern bank of Virginia is located here. It may not be considered irrelative to state that the present population of Wheeling is estimated at about 8,000 souls; shewing an increase in the last four years, (since the census of 1830) of about fifty per cent.; and, in the last 15 years, of about eight hundred per cent! The colored part of the population, both slaves and free blacks—amounting to less than two hundred—it is highly probable that Wheeling contains already, the largest white population of any town or city, in the state, and, in reference to its manufactories and commerce, if not the first, is doubtless, the second town in the commonwealth. A growth so rapid, is believed to be altogether unexampled in Virginia; and but seldom surpassed even in the rapidly filling districts of the "great west." This town, the capital of Ohio county, situated at the head of steam boat navigation on the Ohio, during the low water season; at the termination of the eastern, and commencement of the western division of the great "Cumberland," or "National Road," possessing unexampled facilities and advantages for manufacturing, in the abundance and low cost of all materials, and especially of fuel; (coal, costing, delivered at the factories, but one to three cents per bushel.) surrounded by a country of uncommon fertility, and remarkable for health—cannot but continue to advance in business, population and wealth. County and Corporation Courts are held on the 3d Monday, in every month — Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery are held on the 14th of May and October, by Judge Fry. PAGE. Page was established by act of Assembly in 1831, and formed out of parts of Rockingham and Shenandoah. It is bounded on the W. and N. W. by Shenandoah,—N. and N. E. by Frederick,—E. by the Blue Ridge, separating it from Rappahannock,—S. E. by Madison, and S. and S. W. by Rockingham, Length 34 miles, breadth 11, and area 374 square miles Lat. 38° 45′ long. 1° 25′ W. of W. C. It consists of one entire valley. The Blue Ridge lying on the east and the Fort or Massanuttin mountain on the west. The Shenandoah river passes through the whole length of the county, running from south to north. The Blue Ridge and Fort mountain are exactly parallel to each other, and here range due north and south, thus making the county an oblong square—the east and west boundary lines running on the top of these mountains respectively. These mountains present a most beautiful and pictureque appearance at all seasons of the year. The snow and ice, and clouds of winter, are not less beautiful, though something more dreary, than the refreshing green of summer, or 52 the bright and varied hues of autumn. The land in this county is generally of the very best quality of limestone, valley land—a very considerable portion is bottom, lying on the Shenandoah river and Hawksbill and other creeks. Considered in relation to its agricultural advantages, it is with the exception of Jefferson, the richest county of its size, in the state. The productions of the soil are such as are common in the valley of Virginia. There are in the county 61 saw mills, 24 merchant mills, 20 grist mills, 6 carding machines, 3 oil mills, 6 hemp mills, 10 tan yards, 1 blast furnace for smelting iron and making castings, and 2 forges for making bar iron. These forges and this furnace belong to Benj Blackford &amp; Son, and their manufactures in iron, are annually worth 50,000 dollars. Vast quantities of iron ore are found in every part of the county. Copper, lead and magnesia are also found in considerable quantities. Beautiful marble is found in many places. The town of Luray may be said to be almost built on a rock of gray marble—but as yet there has been no effort made to dress it for ornamental use. The rock is blown, and the marble in its rough and crude state—is used for all the common building purposes of the town. It never can become an article of commerce, until there are increased facilities of transportation. The population by the census in 1830 was 8,327, about 1000 of whom were slaves. It belongs to the 14th judicial circuit and 7th district. Tax paid in 1833, $1354 09—in 1834, on lots, $49 65—land, $989 56—517 slaves, $129 25—1991 horses, $189 46—6 studs, $38 00—6 coaches, $13 00—4 gigs, $2 50. Total, $1341 42. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $237 25—in 1833, $369 18. Curiosities.—There are several very large mounds or Indian graves, such as are common to the Ohio and Mississippi valley—from one of which, situated in a field in cultivation, bones, beads, pipes, &amp;c. are continually dragged by the plough. There are many large and extensive caves in this county, such as are peculiar to lime stone countries—one of which, that at Cave Hill, is thought to be little inferior in extent and beauty to Weyer's Cave. It is not however, very accessible, the entrance being difficult, and is therefore but little visited. The author has been so obliging as to send us the following beautiful description of this remarkable cave—which he published in the Shenandoah Sentinel, May 14th, 1825, it is well written and well worthy of perusal. "Wonders of Cave Hill.—It would seem that all that region of country lying west of the Blue Ridge, as far towards the Pacific ocean as it has been explored and known, abounds in subjects, which, whilst they gratify the curiosity and exercise the utmost stretch of the imagination, confound and baffle the understanding. And a subject not the least curious and wonderful, are those extensive and numerous caverns, which are found generally in the limestone districts of country. "One of those caves has been known to the people of the neighborhood of Luray, in Page county, during a number of years past, but nothing like a full discovery of its beauties was ever made until within a few days past. This cave is about one mile west of the town of Luray, and situated within a hundred yards of the road leading from Thornton's Gap to New Market. The entrance is almost exactly at the top of a small mountain, which has for along time been known to the neighborhood by the name of Cave Hill. Recently several attempts had been made to explore this subterranean world, but rather unsuccessfully; and on Saturday last a party of fifteen gentlemen left Luray, with a determination to give it a complete exploration. "The mouth of the cave was rather difficult of access, owing to its smallness; but the party eager for the marvellous and impatient of obstacles, fell manfully to work, and in a short time, by breaking and removing the rocks, a different and more commodious entrance than the one formerly used, was opened into the cave. Then commenced the bustle of preparation for the descent. The broad cloth and finer articles of dress were quickly laid aside, and in their stead was substituted old clothing, which had been specially provided for the occasion. Then the descent commenced—each man provided with a sufficient number of candles for half a day, whilst others carried provisions and refreshments; and others again, instruments for the purpose of ascertaining courses, distances, &amp;c., and of determining other matters relating to the cave. "Here, if we mistake not, was a pretty correct criterion of that physical courage and strength of nerve which we so much admire in others, and which we are all willing to believe we possess ourselves. Each man was willing that his comrade should descend first into this great unknown deep; and all were willing to be the last to enter. In a few moments, however, the whole party were safely entered. The descent for ten or fifteen yards is rather narrow, and at an angle of forty-five degrees; it then takes a horizontal direction, until we are brought at the distance of about one hundred yards from the entrance, to the first room, which from its situation, we called the Lobby. "The passage approaches this room about ten feet above the level of the floor, and at some places it is perpendicular, but the descent into the room, is down the rocks somewhat in the form of steps. This room contains some specimens of beautiful spar. Here we tried to take the bearing of the room, but found from the proximity of minerals, or some unknown cause, that the instruments were rendered wholly useless. Leaving this room, we proceeded in a direction which seemed to be west and southwest, and down the side of the hill. This passage has somewhat the appearance of a large stairway. After descending, as we supposed, about a quarter of a mile, the passage became very straight and smooth, and gradually enlarged until we perceived that we stood in front of a room whose dimensions, from the light of our candles, we could not discover. The entrance here, as in the room which we first entered, was ten or fifteen feet above the level of the floor. After a few moments, however, by clinging to the projections of spar, which here appeared like large icicles, the whole party stood safely upon the floor of this great room. Here all the wonder and magnificence of the subterranean world burst upon us at once. We found that we stood in a room, the area of whose floor was equal to a quarter of an acre. Immediately before us, and within a few feet of the centre of the room, arose a vast column or pillar, in some degree combining architectural proportions; and running up about thirty feet, and supporting the dome of this immense Hall. This column stands upon a block or rude pedestal, about three feet in height, and the shaft where it rests upon it is about the thickness of a man's body. It then swells gradually until it becomes, at the distance of twenty feet from its base, about the size of a barrel, whence it continues of the same size, until it gradually enlarges into its capital, where it reaches the dome. Strange to tell, this vast column is almost as regularly fluted or grooved, as if it had been done with the chisel of the sculptor. About fifteen feet from the main pillar stand two smaller ones, about ten feet in height, which consequently do not reach the ceiling; and just at their base, and nearly between them is a small pool or basin of water. Here the whole party sat down, and unfolding their various bundles of provisions and refreshments, and sticking their candles to the different pillars and projections of the wall, enjoyed their cold collation with such appetites and spirits, as were naturally produced by exercise and the novelty of the scene around us. We perceived now for the first time, by the united glare of all our candles, that the whole of the arch of this immense Hall, was hung with the most beautiful stalactites, and variegated with almost every possible variety of color. In some places it was perfectly white, then red, grey or yellow—and in others it was as clear and transparent as ice. "In looking around us towards the lights which were dispersed in different parts of the Hall, the various small spars or pillars that were pointing up—others that had been detached from the ceiling and lay scattered about the floor—and numerous large blocks of crystalized limestone, produce novel and almost indescribable feelings. It did not require an imagination unusually fervid, to liken this dim picture of the floor, to the miniature ruins of some great city, with a few of its spires and steeples pointing up from the ruins; or to some mighty temple, with its shattered and broken columns and fallen walls, with just sufficient of its materials to shew the style of its former magnificence. "When we had finished our repast and collected our company to push forward in quest of further discoveries, we concluded to call this room Congress Hall; its magnificence being equalled by nothing else within our knowledge. We now proceeded to the left of the entrance by which we came into the Hall—entered an opening which presented itself, and by following rather an uneven and difficult passage, we very soon arrived in another room. Here we found a very pleasing subject for our admiration. A large block or projection of the rock at one side of this room was hung round with a vast number of stalactites, of every possible variety of shape and size,—from the thickness of one's finger to that of one's arm, and from six inches to three or four feet in length. Some one of the party casually striking one of the larger of these stalactites, a loud, full sound was emitted, something like the tone of a distant church bell. Several of the party then drawing pieces of spar across these stalactites, alternately and in concert with each other, it produced a rude and not unpleasing melody, with every gradation of sound, from the deepest tone of the organ to the finest note of the flute. This room we somewhat aptly called the Music Room. Finding no convenient outlet from this room other than the one by which we entered, we returned into Congress Hall. After we had entered this Hall again, and continued to the right until we came to the great stairway, by which we had first entered, we discovered greatly to our surprise that this entrance projected into the Hall twelve or fifteen feet, and was nearly as many feet from the floor. You can form some idea of this singular entrance by supposing a square box with its ends open to be projected through a window into a room. This projected or funnel part of the entrance appeared to have been formed by the same process that the stalactites and spar had been; and its bottom, under which we could all walk and view it, seemed not to be more than nine or ten inches in thickness. Immediately to the right of this passage, commenced, what we very properly called, a Gallery. This Gallery was considerably above the level of the room, and contained a great quantity of very brilliant and beautiful spar. The side of the Gallery next to the Hall was entirely open, from which we could look down into it. We left the gallery, and still continuing to the right around the Hall, we entered a cavity in the floor; and after traversing a tolerably long aud difficult passage, we arrived at a very regular room, the side walls and ceiling of which seemed to be the clear blue limestone, with a thin crystallization as clear as glass over their surface. We could reach the ceiling, upon which we wrote many of our names with white chalk, the day of the month, year, &amp;c. This room we called the Glazed Chamber. In the passage leading to this chamber, we discovered attached to the side of the rock, what appeared to be a complete conch shell. The shape and size—the smoothness and delicate red on the inside, and the roughness on the outside, with the little circle of knobs near the top, all precisely corresponded with the product of the sea. And it appeared that a very gentle tap would have detached it from the rock. Within a few feet of this was a sparry excrescence, exactly resembling the human heart. Its color, shape, and size all precisely corresponded. And near this again, the perfect leg, foot, and talons of a bird projected from the rock. These several objects were so clearly and completely defined and so closely resembled the originals, as to strike the mind even of the most inattentive observer with a degree of astonishment. "From the Glazed Chamber we all once more returned to Congress Hall, and still continued our discoveries to the right around the room. We perceived now, that as the arch of this great room became lower, large stalactites were projected from it and reached the floor; thus forming a beautiful colonnade or row of shining pillars in a line with the direction of the room, and three or four feet from its wall, leaving between this colonnade and the wall a beautiful recess. In this recess one of the simplest, yet one of the most striking beauties of the cave unfolded itself. This was a spring or pool of pure water, which appeared as transparent as ether. This pool or basin is about three or four feet in diameter, and twelve or fourteen inches in depth. The bottom and sides of this basin where the water covers them, are entirely covered with stalagmites or drops of shining spar, which have much the appearance of burnished silver. About the centre of this pool, stands a beautiful stalactite, eighteen inches in height, and unlike all the rest of these specimens of spar which we found arising from the floor, the small end or point rested on the bottom of the basin, and gradually enlarged until it arose several inches above the top of the water, thus presenting the singular appearance of a long cone resting upon its point. Exactly over this, a large spar hangs from the ceiling of the room, and approaches within eighteen inches of that which is in the water. From the point of this hanging spar there runs a stream of water about the thickness of a quill, and falls exactly on the top of the spar in the centre of the spring; and is, in fact, the source from which the spring is supplied. Both of these stalactites have the appearance of large icicles. "To the right of this spring behind the pillars and a little above it, through the solid limestone rock or wall of the room, was a small smooth opening just large enough to admit the body. This opening is perfectly level, and after sliding about ten feet, we came into a room, not so large, but in point of beauty, far exceeding anything which we had seen. The whole interior of this room is a complete lustre, or surface of shining spar. In this room about three and a half feet above the level of the floor, is a complete wainscot or chairboard, with apparent mouldings and carved work in complete relief; and extending in one entire and unbroken circle around the room. In the centre of the floor stand three large spars, resembling candlesticks of a mammoth size. These candlesticks arise from the floor of the room with various enlargements and diminutions, resembling carved work, until they reach the exact level of the chairboard, when the spar which resembles the candle, and seems to be set into a socket, runs up about two feet. As if to make the copy more exact, and the resemblance more palpably striking, the candlesticks seem to be of a dusky or bronze color, and the candle or spar arising from it of a clear white. We called this room the Masonic Hall. One fact here presented itself too palpably to be mistaken. This room had evidently been at one time filled with water to the height of the chairboard, and by the gradual crystallization of the lime and nitre which it held suspended, the chairboard was formed, which at once accounted for its being so perfectly level and regular, and running into all the little hollows and irregularities of the wall. The candlesticks too had been formed in the same way by the dropping of the water from the arch; and which being, as we supposed completely saturated with lime and nitre, was of greater specific gravity than the water into which it fell, and thus was gradually formed the large spars which resembled the candlesticks, until they rose even with the top of the water; after which the spar became immediately small and clear, resembling a candle. The crystallization on the walls of this room is in beautiful waves and folds, resembling drapery. At one end of the room a large spar, resembling a bed post, stood in beautiful relief from the wall, and large folds and waves of drapery, resembling curtains, seemed to hide the rest of the bed. "Here then our admiration and astonishment were at their height. Our feelings had been wrought up to a degree of almost painful intensity. Here we stood hundreds of feet beneath the surface of the earth, and a full half-mile from the first entrance, treading upon a spot and breathing an atmosphere which had not been disturbed since the creation of the world. A place in which the human voice had never before been heard, and on whose beauties the human eye had never rested. There was in truth an awful sublimity in the state of our feelings, superinduced not only by what we saw, but in part perhaps by a contingent danger to which we were exposed. The falling of the arch, or the rolling of a single rock into some of the narrow passages which we had to retrace, would have shut us up in eternal darkness in this mysterious region of wonders. "Why nature should display those various and astonishing beauties only for herself, or place them thus in a region of darkness and danger, is to us marvellous and incomprehensible. Or why she should thus, in a capricious or whimsical mood, group together objects the least resembling each other in their nature and uses is equally strange. A bedstead, drapery and candlesticks—a conch shell, bird's foot and a human heart. Strange and mysterious associations. We cannot fully describe or comprehend them. And all that we could do upon viewing them was to exclaim, wonderful! wonderful! "From the room last described, we returned to the mouth of the cave, and found that we had spent upwards of four hours in examining its beauties, without, however, discovering their full extent. We determined to defer a further search to some other occasion. "This cave is situated on the lands of Mr. David McKay, and is said to have been first partially explored in the following singular manner. A Mr. Ruffner, who was nearly as much celebrated for deeds of sylvan prowess as the renowned Putnam, in passing this cave some thirty years ago, conceived the bold and hazardous design of entering it alone. He accordingly prepared himself a flambeau of pine, and placed his rifle across the mouth, to indicate, in case of accident, to his friends, if they should happen to see it, that he was in the cave. He descended, but soon fell and put out his light, and as might have been expected, was soon bewildered and lost in its labyrinth of passages. It happened that some of his friends in passing the cave discovered his gun, and rightly concluding that he had gone into it, they procured lights and entered in search of him, and found and brought him out again, after his having been in forty-eight hours. This brave fellow was among the pioneers who were foremost in exploring and settling our western frontier; and was at last killed by the Indians, after having performed deeds of valor and daring prowess, which would have done honor to the character of a hero." We suggest the propriety of commemorating the exploit mentioned in this last paragraph, by calling this cave in future Ruffner's Cave. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Hambaugh's, P.

It is situated on the Hawksbill creek, near the centre of the county, and equidistant from Thornton's Gap on the E., and Massanutten Gap on the W. The first house in this village was built in 1814. It now contains besides the ordinary county buildings, between 40 and 50 dwelling houses, 2 houses of public worship, (1 Baptist and 1 Methodist.) There are 4 mercantile stores, 1 tan yard, 2 cabinet makers, 2 wheelwrights, and various other mechanics. Population 400 persons, of whom 3 are resident attorneys and 3 regular physicians. County Courts are held on the 4th Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, May, August and November. Judge Smith holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 1st of April and September. The court house in this village which is erected on a considerable eminence, and on the edge of the town, is perhaps one of the handsomest buildings of the kind in Western Virginia. It commands a view of the mountains to the east and west far beyond the limits of the county. Marksville, P. O. 125 ms. from R. and 112 from W. Massanutten, P. O. 144 ms. from R. and 114 W. of W.

Pendleton was created by an act of Assembly passed in 1788, and formed from a portion of Augusta, Hardy, and Rockingham. It is bounded N. by Hardy,—E. and S. E. by a ridge called the Great North mountain, which separates it from Rockingham and Augusta,—S. by Bath,—and W. by the main Alleghany chain, which separates it from Pocahontas and Randolph. Its mean length is 38½ miles, mean breadth 26, and area 999 square miles. It extends in lat. from 38° 15, to 38° 53′ N, and in long. from 2° to 2° 42′ W. of W. C. Pendleton occupies the most elevated part of the table land between its two bounding ridges of mountains, discharging to the S. W. the extreme sources of James river, and in an opposite direction the higher sources of south branch of Potomac. Comparing the general elevation of Pendleton with the determined height of James river in Alleghany county, considering the whole slope of Bath county intervening, the level of the arable land from whence flow the sources of James and Potomac rivers, must exceed 2000 feet. Covington in Alleghany at the junction of Pott's creek with Jackson's, is 1,222 feet above the mean tide in Chesapeake bay, and at this point the water of Jackson river has fallen down a plain of upwards of 50 miles descent. The southern end of this county is pretty equally divided into four vallies, by five parallel ridges of mountains, which go under the following names, beginning on the eastern side, first, Shenandoah mountain— second, Cowpasture mountain—third, Bullpasture mountain—fourth, Jackson's mountain, and fifth, Fore mountain, to the main Alleghany ridge. The valley between the Shenandoah and Cowpasture mountains is watered by a stream called Shaw's fork, a branch of the Cowpasture river, and is of a thin soil, and badly cultivated. Near the head of the fork, are two beautiful mineral springs, about two miles apart, which would rank among the first watering places in Western Virginia, provided the necessary accommodations could be furnished to visiters. The valley between the Cowpasture and Bullpasture mountains, is watered by the Cowpasture river, and is rather superior in point of soil and cultivation to the former. The valley between the Bullpasture and Jackson's mountains, is watered by the Bullpasture river, a rapid and beautiful stream, which furnishes a number of commodious sites for machinery. The soil in this valley is good, well adapted to the growth of grass, and the production of grain, is well improved, and in a tolerable state of cultivation. The valley between Jackson and the Fore mountains, is watered by Jackson's river, and will bear nearly the same description of the former. There is in the S. W. part of the county on the head of Jackson's river, a small village by the name of Woodsboro'. It contains seven houses, a tanyard, and various mechanics, but it is on the decline. The Crab run is a beautiful stream of pure water; it has its rise at the eastern base of Jackson's mountain, and flows in a S. E. direction about ten miles, through the southern end of the county, and empties into the Bullpasture river, about one mile below the post office of the same name. The wedge of land pointing above its junction with the Bullpasture, affords one of the most beautiful sites for a town that is any where to be found in this section of country, several dwelling houses, 1 mercantile store, a saw mill, a blacksmith shop, 1 house of public worship, and 1 common school, have been erected on this spot of ground, which is known by the name of Sugar Tree Grove. There are within the limits of this description, and south of the main Alleghany ridge, 3 houses of public worship, (Methodist,) 2 tan yards, 2 mercantile stores, and a sufficient number of common schools, for the education of youth, with various mechanics. From the main Alleghany ridge northwestward, this part of the county is divided into five valleys, by as many different parallel ridges of mountains. The first valley is watered by the south fork of the south branch of Potomac, and is situated between the Shenandoah and Thorn mountains.—The south fork has its rise in the S. W. part of the county, within a few hundred yards of the head spring of the Cowpasture river, which flows the other way. From the head of the south fork for about 18 miles down the stream, the land is of a sandy soil, and is arid, thin and unproductive, and every thing wears the aspect of poverty. Proceeding a little lower down, the bottom begins to widen, the soil becomes more fertile, the farms are more enlarged and in a better state of cultivation and repair. "The manners and dress of the people discover more polish,—the hair of their flocks and herds has changed its weather-worn deadness, for a slick and glossy coat, and every thing assumes the appearance of thriftiness and better living." The S. fork has but one tributary stream of any note, which it receives about ten miles from its source, and which is known by the name of Bushby's fork. There is one store on the head of the south fork. There are two others below this,—one about 20, the other about 30 miles,—the first is 15. the second 9, and the third 12 miles from Franklin county seat. There are also four houses of public worship on this water, (3 Lutheran and 1 Union.) The first is 19, the second 15, the third 10, and the fourth 13 miles from the county seat. The S. fork flows N. E. and after passing into Hardy county, empties into the S. branch of the Potomac, about 4 miles below the county line. The S. branch of the Potomac is formed by the junction of Streight and Crab creeks, which have their rise in the N. W. part of the county, and flow a N. E. course through the county, watering the valley which lays between the Thorn and N. fork mountains. The soil in this valley is rich, and well adapted to grass and grain. In this valley are 4 houses of public worship, (1 on the head of Streight creek, and 1 on Crab creek,) the former 20, the latter 22 miles above Franklin, both of which belong to the Methodist; and 12 miles below, and another 13, one of which is Lutheran and the other Methodist. The S. branch is a pure and beautiful stream of water, and receives within this county the following streams. 3 miles above Franklin, the Black Thorn —10 miles below, Reed's creek—and 3 miles below this is Mill creek. Three miles above Franklin, there is a rich saltpetre cave, from which a vast quantity of nitre has been made, but the works are now idle. The entrance of the cave is a small aperture near the base of a small mountain, and it extends under ground for some miles. 53 The next portion in order, is the north fork valley, which is watered by the N. fork of the S. branch. It has its rise in the S. W. part of the county, and flows a N. E. course, and after passing into Hardy county empties into the S. branch a little below the county line, receiving in its course but one stream of any note, which is known by the name of Seneca. The land in this valley is good, and produces well both grass and grain. There are on the N. fork 2 houses of public worship, (both Methodist,) and 1 store. Between this and the main Alleghany mountain, there are two other ridges, the local names of which are Timber Ridge and Spruce mountain. The lands on these, as well as the other ridges of mountains in the county, are of tolerable soil, and but thinly settled; but they afford an excellent range for stock during the summer season, and give birth to a number of springs of the best water. There are 2 other tan yards in this county besides those already named. No merchant mills, but the valleys are well furnished with common grist mills, carding machines,—blacksmiths, and other mechanics. Population in 1820, 4,836—in 1830, 6,271. It belongs to the 14th judicial circuit and 7th district. Tax paid in 1833, $1,032 46—in 1834 on lots, $28 30—land, $656 38—280 slaves, $70 00—3530 horses, $211 80—24 studs, $104 50—2 coaches, $4 00—16 carryalls, $16 00— Total, $1090 98. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $515 43 —in 1833, $520 93. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Crab Run, P. V. 154 ms. N. W. by W. of R. and 196 S. W. by W. of W., situated in the S. W. part of the county. A house of public entertainment, a grist and a saw mill, a blacksmith's and a wheelwright's shop are located here. FRANKLIN, P. V. and seat of justice, 171 ms. N. W. by W. of R. and the same distance S. W. by W. of W., in lat 38° 42′ and long 2° 26′ W. of W. C., situated on the north bank of the South Branch of the Potomac, 20 miles from its source. It contains besides the ordinary county buildings, 30 dwelling houses, 1 common school, 1 temperance and 1 bible society, 2 mercantile stores, 2 tan yards, 3 saddlers, 1 hatter, 2 house carpenters, 1 cabinet and chair maker, 1 printing office, 1 tailor, 2 blacksmiths, 1 gunsmith, and 2 boot and shoe makers. Population 250 persons; of whom 2 are resident attorneys, and 1 a regular physicisn. County Courts are held on the Wednesday succeeding the 1st Tuesday in every month;—Quarterly in March, June, September and November. Judge Smith holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 2d of May and 3d of October. Hull's Store, P. O. 164 miles from R. and 206 W. of W. Oak Flat, P. O. 176 ms. from R. and 186 from W. POCAHONTAS. Pocahontas was established by act of the General Assembly in the year 1821, and formed from a portion of the counties of Bath, Pendleton and Randolph. It is bounded N. by Randolph,—E. by the Alleghany mountains which separate it from Pendleton and Bath,—S. by Greenbrier, —and W. by Nicholas. Its mean length is 40 miles, mean breadth 17½; and its area 794 square miles. its mean lat. is 38° 20′ N. and long. 3° W. of W. C. This county is one of the most elevated in the Union. Cheat river, a branch of the Monongahela, rises in the northern part,—Gauley river, a branch of the Great Kanawha, rises in the western part, and Greenbrier river, a branch likewise of the Great Kanawha, rises in the extreme northeastern part, and flowing in a southwestern direction, nearly parallel with the main Alleghany range, passes through Greenbrier into Monroe, on the border of which it unites with New river. Knapp's creek, the largest tributary which the Greenbrier receives in this county, rises at the foot of the Alleghany, flows for some distance along its base, and then turning at right angles flows north west by Huntersville, and empties into the Greenbrier a few miles below that town. The mean height of the arable soil of Greenbrier county is 1700 feet above the level of the ocean, and as it is situated lower down on the Greenbrier than the county of Pocahontas, it is fair to presume that the height of the lowest part of the latter must be at least equal to 1800 feet above the ocean, which is equivalent to four degrees of latitude. Greenbrier mountain enters Pocahontas on the N. E. and passes through to the S. W.—from its western side flow Gauley and Elk rivers. The surface is very broken and rocky, but the southern part is quite productive of all the staples common to the same latitude,—towards the northeast the land is more barien. The principal timber which it produces is white and black spruce, yew, pine, white oak, chesnut, sugar maple, hickory, beech, walnut, buck-eye, &amp;c. &amp;c. The inhabitants are honest, industrious, hospitable and enterprising citizens. Population in 1830, 2,541. It belongs to the 17th judicial circuit and 9th district. Tax paid in 1833, $386 09—in 1834 on lots, $13 92—on land $199 36—136 slaves, $34 00—1154 horses, $92 76—6 studs, $29 00—1 coach, $2 00— 2 carryalls, $2 25. Total $373 29. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $211 29—in 1833, $157 28. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Cackley's P. O. 202 ms. N. W. by W. of R. and 244 from W., situated 2 ms. W. of Greenbrier river, immediately on the main post road leading from Huntersville to Lewisburg, 12 ms. S. W. of the former, and 36 N. E. of the latter place. It contains several dwelling houses, 1 mercantile store, 1 oil mill, 1 carding machine, 1 tan yard, &amp;c. &amp;c. The country around is mostly level and fertile, producing well Indian corn, wheat, rye, oats, potatoes, flax, &amp;c., and is an excellent grass country. This is called the Little Levels. First rate springs abound in almost every direction, and most or all of them sink again after running a short disance. Green Bank, P. O. 200 ms. from R. and 242 W. of W., situated on the north bank of Deer creek, six miles above its intersection with the Greenbrier river, and 19 north of Huntersville. This is merely a post office, situated in the heart of a thickly settled neighborhood, which contains 1 house of public worship, free for all denominations, called Deer Creek Union Meeting House, 5 common schools, 1 well organized temperance, bible, tract and sunday school society, with a considerable library, 2 mercantile stores, several excellent country mills, and various other mechanics. The land of the surrounding country is beautifully diversified by hill and dale. The soil is rich, producing in abundance wheat, rye, oats, corn, &amp;c. The principal pursuits of the inhabitants are grazing and raising stock. There are large quantities of butter, venison hams, &amp;c. taken to market from this section of country. The inhabitants are also expert in the manufacture of sugar from the maple tree. There is a very great curiosity in the meanders of Deer creek. About 5 miles below Green Bank, the creek runs several miles round a considerable hill, and thence back within thirty poles of the place it had passed, affording some fine seats for manufactories, with sufficient water power to force machinery to any extent. HUNTERSVILLE, P. V. and county seat, 191 ms. N. W. by W. of R. and 233 S. W. by W. of W., situated in lat. 38° 12′ N. and long 3° 1′ W. of W. C. It is situated between Greenbrier and Alleghany mountains, at an elevation above the Atlantic of upwards of 1,800 feet, on Knapp's creek, 6 miles from its junction with the Greenbrier river. It contains besides the usual county buildings, 23 dwelling houses, (mostly frame,) 3 mercantile stores, 2 taverns, and 1 school in which the ordinary branches of English education are taught, 2 tailors, 2 house carpenters and cabinet makers, 1 boot and shoe maker, and 1 blacksmith shop. There are in this place 2 well organized bible classes, and 1 temperance society. A turnpike road has lately been located from the Warm Springs in Bath county to Huntersville, thence to intersect the northwestern road between Clarksburg and Parkersburg, or to strike the Ohio river below the latter place. The road when finished will add greatly to the advancement of this village and the surrounding country, there being as fine lands in this section as perhaps in any part of Virginia Huntersville is 22 miles from the Warm Springs, 65 from Beverly in Randolph co and 48 from Lewisburg in Greenbrier county. There are near this village two sulphur springs, said to possess good qualities. Population 125 persons; of whom 1 is a resident attorney. County Courts are held on the 1st Tuesday in every month; Quarterly in March, June, August, and November. Judge Taylor holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 2d of May and October. Matthewsville, P. O. 205 ms. from R. and 247 W. of W., situated on the main post road leading from Huntersville to Clarksburg, the county seat of Harrison, 15 miles from the former, and on Settlington's creek, a branch of the Greenbrier, 2½ miles from its junction with the river. This post office is located in a densely settled neighborhood, in its immediate vicinity are a considerable number of scattering dwelling houses, 1 house of public worship. (Presbyterian,) 1 school house and 1 merchant mill, with a population of about 400. The land of the surrounding country is fertile, producing wheat, rye, oats, &amp;c., but is more generally famed for fine meadow and pasture grounds. Knapp's Creek, P.O. 242 ms. S. W. of W. Traveller's Repose, P. O. 179 ms. from R. and 221 S. W. by W. of W., situated in a thickly settled neighborhood, on the head of Greenbrier, between the north and east forks of that river, immediately on the main post road leading from Staunton to Clarksburg, and 32 ms. from Huntersville, the county seat. It contains 12 dwelling house, 1 tavern, 1 store, and several mechanics. The soil is productive of wheat, rye, oats, buckwheat, potatoes, &amp;c., affording excellent pasturage for stock. It is bounded by various mountains, the most noted is the Alleghany on the east, the Laurel Ridge on the west, and the Elk mountain on the north—which still abounds with the elk. The soil of these mountains is rich and affords immense ranges for cattle, &amp;c. The timber is generally sugar maple, chesnut, oak, and pine. The fir tree is frequently met with here. The Cheat mountain turnpike runs thro' this place and the mail is received once a week on horseback. PRESTON. Preston was created by the Legislature in 1818, from a portion of Monongalia county. It is bounded N. by Fayette county of Pennsylvania, —E. by Alleghany county of Maryland,—S. by Randolph,—and W. by Monongalia. Its mean length is 30 miles, mean breadth 20; and area 601 square miles. Its mean lat. is 39° 30′ and long. 2° 38′ W. of W. C. Its extent and population have been somewhat increased, though we do not know precisely to what degree, since the taking of the last census and the publication of Boyee's map of the State, by extending its eastern border to the "Fairfax Stone," situated at the extreme southwestern angle of Maryland. The main Alleghany chain runs near the eastern border of this county, and the Chesnut ridge separates it from Monongalia on the west. The body of the county is a valley between these two chains. Cheat river enters the southern side and winds to the N. W. dividing the county into two nearly equal sections. The general face of the county is mountainous, interspersed on the eastern and western sides with large natural meadows called "glades," which afford support for large herds of cattle in summer, and in winter also, when it is mown and cured for winter food. The glades are destitute of timber but covered in summer with grass and weeds, with frequent projecting points of timber, low bushes, &amp;c. The soil of this section of the county is better suited to grass than grain, though small quantities of corn and wheat are grown in the glades, and abundant crops of oats, buckwheat and rye. The alluvial or bottom grounds are small but productive and many of the mountain and hill sides produce abundant crops of corn, wheat, rye, oats, &amp;c. The principal water is Cheat river, about 180 yards wide at the Dunkard Bottom; though branches of the Monongahela and Youghiogany water a large part of the county. The general strata of rock so far as known, is a kind of sand stone, occasional portions of which are intermixed with flinty pebbles so compact as to be used for mill stones to advantage; but much of it is easily wrought for building houses, &amp;c. Slate and limestone is common; the county is abundantly supplied with bituminous coal, and specimens of iron ore are often found. Population in 1820, 3,480— 1830, 5,144. This county belongs to the twentieth judicial circuit, and tenth district. Tax paid in 1833, $437 91—in 1834 on lots, $24 54— land $264 31—56 slaves, $14 00—1882 horses, $112 92—17 studs, $73 50—2 carryalls, $3 00. Total $492 97. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $306 94—in 1833, $361 92. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Brandonville, P. V. 280 ms. N. W. of R. and 202 from W. This is a newly settled village, pleasantly situated in the centre of a rapidly improving neighborhood, in the northern section of the county, about four miles from the Pennsylvania line, on the road leading from Smithfield in Pennsylvania to Morgantown, Virginia. It contains 20 dwelling houses, 1 house of public worship, (Methodist,) 1 tavern, 1 tan yard, 1 saddler, 1 hatter, 1 wagon maker, 2 cabinet makers, 1 wheelwright and chair maker, 1 silversmith, 1 tailor, 1 blacksmith shop, 2 mercantile stores, 1 common school, 1 temperance and 1 colonization society. Population 100. Evansville, P. O. situated in the western part of the county, near the north western turnpike road. German Settlement, P. O. 270 ms. from R. and 270 N. W. by W. of W. situated 18 ms. S. E. of Kingswood. This settlement, in the midst of which is situated a small village called Mount Carmel, took its name from its first settlers, who were Germans. It contains between 80 and 100 dwelling houses, besides mechanic's shops, &amp;c., 1 house of public worship, free for all denominations, 2 mercantile stores. 3 grist mills, 4 saw mills, 1 wool carding machine, 2 tan yards, 2 gun smiths, 4 blacksmith shops, 1 wheelwright, 1 wagon maker, 1 millwright, several house carpenters, cabinet makers, house-joiners, &amp;c. But the principal pursuit of the inhabitants is agriculture. This settlement is watered by the Youghiogany, the north fork of which heads near Mount Carmel, and is known by the name of Ryan creek. Wolf creek which empties into Cheat river, also heads near this place. The soil is of the first quality, and productive of all kinds of grain; and especially productive of grass. An abundance of potatoes and turnips are raised in this section of country. The climate is cool and salubrious Pure springs of never failing water flow in abundance through this settlement. The principal staple commodities raised for market, are live stock of every discription, and large quantities of butter of the first qualiity, &amp;c. This settlement, like many others in Western Virginia, has been sealed up ever since the settling of the same, for want of suitable roads for transportation through the Alleghany mountains in order to unite in commerce with the eastern country. The northwestern turnpike road of Virginia from Winchester to Parkersburg, passes immediately through the German Settlement. This road is in rapid progress, and there is no grade through the Alleghany mountains that exceeds four and a half degrees. This appropriation of money by the Legislature of Virginia is of the greatest utility to this section of the State. The number of families which may be called attached to this settlement will not exceed 70, the aggregate number of inhabitants about 500, and what may be further worthy of remark (in Virginia,) that in this number are not more than three or four blacks. KINGWOOD, P. V. and seat of justice, 261 ms. from R. and 183 N. W. by W. of W., in lat. 39° 27′ N. and long. 2° 45′ W. of W. C., situated on a beautiful and healthy eminence, 2 ms. W. of Cheat river, 20 E. of Morgantown, 43 from Clarksburg, in Harrison county, and 60 from Beverly, in Randolph county. It contains besides the ordinary county buildings, which are substantially built of stone, 25 dwelling houses, 3 mercantile stores, 1 tanyard, and various mechanics. Population about 150 persons; of whom 3 are resident attorneys, and 1 a regular physician. County Courts are held on the 2d Monday in every month.—Quarterly in March, May, August and November. Judge Fry holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 1st of April, and September. RANDOLPH. Randolph was established by act of Assembly in the year 1787, and formed from a portion of Harrison county. It is bounded N. by Preston,— N. E. by the Alleghany mountain, which separates it from Hardy,—E. by the same mountain, separating it from Pendleton,—S. by Pocahontas,—S. W. by Nicholas,—W. by Lewis and Harrison,—and N. W. by Monongalia. Its mean length is 66½ miles diminished by the difference which would be occasioned by taking from it that portion which is laid down in our maps as co-terminous with Maryland,—which has been added to Preston,— its mean breadth 31, and its area 2,061 square miles, diminished by the area of the above space alluded to extending in lat. from about 38° 18′ to 39° 11′ N. and in long. from about 2° 15′ to 3° 28′ W. of W. C. This county is one of the finest on the western side of the Alleghany mountains, and is made up of several parallel ranges of mountains with their intervening vallies. The largest of these mountains commencing on the east is the Alleghany, which runs north and south dividing this county from Pendleton; the next in order are Rich, Middle and Shaver mountains, running in the same direction. At the foot of the latter, flows Shaver's Fork, which is stocked with some of the finest fish which the western waters afford. This stream empties into the Monongahela, 12 miles below Morgantown. The next mountain is the Valley mountain, which derives its name from Tygart's valley. This valley constitutes a considerable portion of the county, being about 35 miles in length, and 2 in breadth, and a body of as fine land as any in Western Virginia, and in a high state of improvement. Through this valley flows the middle branch of the Monongahela, or Tygart's valley river, to which it gives source. The next mountain is the Laurel, which runs also a north and south course, the whole length of the valley; at the extremity of which it makes a bend and takes a northeast direction, till it meets Cheat river, whence it flows nearly in a north course, till it enters the State of Pennsylvania. At the foot of Tygart's valley, where the Laurel hill makes its angle to the east, Chester river breaks through the mountain. The valley and mountains presenting the strongest evidence that at some early day they had formed a lake. These mountains afford some of the finest streams of water in Western Virginia, the principal of which are the Dry fork—Laurel fork—Glade fork—and Shaver's fork—all handsome streams, having their rise in the S. W. part of the county, running parallel within a few miles of each other, and after traversing a considerable distance through the county emptying into Cheat river. The mountains are well stocked with the finest timber, such as every description of the oak, poplar, cherry, pine, fir, red cedar, &amp;c.—and they are almost a mass of stone coal and iron ore. The soil of these mountains is very rich, and abounds with lime stone, slate and free stone. In some parts of these mountains are found small caverns or caves, in which is found a kind of copperas—fit for dye, and which is used for that purpose,—and along some of the water courses is found the allum peeping out of the joints of the rocks, forming in the shape of icicles. Among all these water courses and low grounds are found salt springs. There has been salt made to a considerable amount, but for the want of funds and men of enterprise, these useful minerals remain in their natural state. In this county are a considerable number of fine stock farms, which graze and raise annually for market live stock of every description, which is the principal source of its wealth. There were raised and sent to market from this county during the past year ending Nov'r 1st, 1833, 1,500 head of horned cattle, 300 sheep, and 100 horses. Population in 1830, 5,000. It belongs to the 18th judicial circuit, and 9th district. Tax paid in 1833, $618—in 1834, on lots, $16 56—on land, $403 93—144 slaves, $36 00—2133 horses, $127 98—8 studs, $46 00— 3 coaches, $6 00—3 carryalls, $3 00—Total, $639 47. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $280 64—in 1833, $600 09. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. BEVERLY, P. V. and seat of justice, 210 ms. N. W. by W. of R. and 221 S. W. of W.—in lat 38° 50′ N. and long 2° 55′ W. of W. C.— situated near the centre of Tygart's Valley, near Tygart's Valley river, on a handsome plain, stretched out between Phillis's creek, and Dotson's run. The former entering the river a little above, and the latter about a quarter of a mile below the town.— Beverly contains besides the public buildings, 3 mercantile stores, 2 taverns, 1 common school, 1 tanyard, 2 saddlers, 2 boot and shoe factories, 3 blacksmith shops, 1 hatter, 1 wagon maker, 1 house carpenter, 2 tailors, &amp;c.—This village is distant 60 miles nearly due S. from Morgantown, in Monongalia county, and 45 S. E. of Clarksburg, in Harrison county. The Valley river has its source in the mountain, and courses along nearly in a northwardly direction through the valley. The land on its borders possesses a considerable degree of fertility; and the eye in traversing it beholds some fine mountain scenery, (being completely environed with spurs of the Alleghany mountain,) as well as some handsome farms in a high state of cultivation. Proceeding down the Valley, at different points from 12 to 18 miles below the town, common roads cross the mountains, leading to the lower, and thickly settled parts of the county. As we proceed down the Valley, at various intervals, fine farms, mercantile stores, and houses of public worship, for Presbyterians, Baptists and Methodists, are met with. This village contains a population of 166 whites, of whom two are resident attornies, and two regular physicians,—16 slaves and 2 free colored—Total, 184. County Courts are held on the 4th Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery are held on the 19th of April and 13th September by Judge Duncan. Billsburg, P. O. 240 ms. from R. and 224 from W. Boothe's Ferry, P. O. 240 ms. from R. and 299 W. of W.—Situated on the east side of Tygart's Valley river, 20 ms. N. W. of Beverly, and 30 S. E. of Clarksburg, in Harrison county. Two considerable streams enter Tygart's Valley river above this P. O. Middle river 7 miles above, and Buchanan river only four and a half miles above. The P. O. is located on a farm of rich bottom lands. There are located at this point 3 dwelling houses, 1 saw and 1 grist mill running two pair of stones, and a wool carding machine. There are in the vicinity four coal banks, two of which are within a few yards of the boat landing; there is also a great quantity of iron ore of the best quality, within a few yards of the river and near the coal banks. The soil is good, and produces corn, wheat, rye, oats, &amp;c. in abundance, and is equal to any country for timothy and clover. The river is the line of separation between Harrison and Randolph for about 4½ miles above, and as far below as this county extends. It is about 40 miles to the mouth of this river, at which point it unites with the West fork river and becomes the Monongahela. The river at this place is about 120 yards wide, and has to be crossed in a boat about 8 months in the year. The road leading from Clarksburg crosses at this ferry. The northwestern turnpike has been laid out to cross about 16 miles below. Glady Creek Cross Roads, P. O. 244 ms. from R. and 220 from W. Huttonsville, P. O. 199 miles from R. and 231 W. of W. C. Leedsville, P. V. 218 ms. from R. and 229 from W.—situated at the passage of Tygart's Valley river, through the Laurel mountain, 8 ms. N. N. E. of Beverly, on the main post road leading from Philadelphia and Baltimore through Winchester to Pittsylvania, Pa. This is merely a post office, situated on a farm in the midst of a flourishing part of the country. Miegsville, P. V. 256 ms. from R. and 208 W. of W. It contains 5 dwelling houses, 1 house of entertainment, 1 gunsmith, 1 blacksmith's shop, 1 tanyard, 1 saddler and a distillery. In this little village is established a small ingenious weaving manufactory, with several looms of various descriptions, executing a variety of figured work. The soil of the surrounding country is rich; and stone coal is every where close at hand. Skidmore's P. O.—The distances are not given on the P. O. list. Western Ford, P. O. 240 ms. W. of R. and 251 from W. Wyatt's Ferry, P. O. 245 ms. from R. and 229 from W. ROCKBRIDGE. Rockbridge was established by act of Assembly in 1778, and formed from a portion of Augusta and Botetourt counties. It is bounded N. by Augusta,—E. by the Blue Ridge which separates it from Nelson,—S. E. by the same mountain, separating it from Amherst,—S. by Bedford,—S. W. by Botetourt, and W. by Alleghany and Mill mountains, a portion of the Great Kittatinny chain which separates it from Alleghany, and N. W., by the same separating it from Bath. Its mean lat is about 37° 45′ N. and long. 2° 30′ W. of W. C.—Its mean length is 31 mean breadth 22; and area 680 square miles. This county is principally watered by North river, branch of James river, and its tributaries. It flows diagonally through the county from the N. W. to the S. E. and joins the main branch of James river at the foot of the Blue Ridge, when their united waters force a passage through. The name of this county is taken from the celebrated Natural Bridge, of which an account is given below. There are in the county 10 mercantile stores, 6 iron forges, three furnaces, 13 houses of public worship, (of which 9 are Presbyterian,) and 24 grist and merchant mills; besides those mentioned in the Towns, Villages, &amp;c. Much of the soil is of the first quality, and generally in a high state of cultivation. Population in 1820, 11,945—in 1830, 14,244. It belongs to the 12th judicial circuit, and 6th district. Tax paid in 1833, $3131 41—in 1834, on lots, $208 58—on land, $1831 33—2037 slaves, $509 25—5250 horses, $315 00—21 studs, $206 00—37 coaches, $98 21—21 carryalls, $21 70 —7 gigs, $5 20—Total, $3195 27. Exponded in educating poor children in 1832, $873 76—in 1833, $748 40. 54 TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Balcony Falls, P. O. 153 ms. from R. and 210 S. W. by W. of W. These falls are situated on James river, near the western extremity of the James river canal, and form the dividing line between the counties of Rockbridge, Bedford, and Amherst. The scenery near this spot is highly picturesque. After toiling for a considerable distance through a wild and rugged country—on turning the sharp angle of the mountain, the river suddenly expands to the breadth, and assumes the quiet and placid appearance of a lake. Immediately opposite, two of the most stupendous peaks of the Blue Ridge, rise directly from the banks. The whole stream is suddenly narrowed by the projecting sides of the mountain, and precipitates itself in one entire sheet over an artificial dam, which is extended across the bed of the river, between the most elevated points of the peaks. After the fall the tumultuous stream is soon lost sight of, by the windings of the channel. The dam was erected for the purpose of supplying with its back water that portion of the canal which runs upon the edge of the fall. This portion of the canal, seven miles in extent, was constructed by the state at the cost of $280,000. About two miles of this canal is in the county of Rockbridge. Bath Iron Works, P. O. 167 ms. W. of R. and 209 S. W. by W. of W.—Situated in the southern part of the county, on the northeastern bank of James river, within ten miles of its source,—15 miles from Lexington,—and 22 from the Warm Springs in Bath county. These works consist of a furnace and forge, both built on an extensive scale—the furnace is 40 feet high, and calculated for making 30 tons of pig iron pr. week, but has never yet reached that amount. The forge is built for running six fires, and will annually forge 300 tons of bar iron—The furnace 700 tons of pig metal, and a large quantity of castings. The two consuming 300 thousand bushels of charcoal per annum. The number of operatives employed are sixty-five. Yet there are something like 150 persons supported by its operations, including women and children. Attached to this establishment is a large farm, a part of which, supposed to be 350 acres, is first rate bottom land,—by which the proprietors are enabled to raise nearly their full supply of grain; the quantity required being 4,500 bushels;— from 3,000 to 3,500 bushels of which are raised annually from the farm.— This establishment is owned by Messrs A. W. &amp; M. W. Davis. Belle Valley, P. O. 147 ms. W. of R. and 188 S. W. by W. from W. —Situated in the northeastern part of the county. Brownsburg, P. V. 143 ms. N. W. of R. and 185 from W.—Situated 12 miles N. E. of Lexington, on Maffits creek, and on the direct route from Staunton to Lexington.

In the immediate vicinity there is a large and spacious house of public worship, long known by the name of New Providence meeting house Population 120 persons; of whom 3 are physicians. Brownsburg is located in a flourishing and thickly settled neighborhood. Buffalo Forge, P. O. 156 ms. from R. and 206 from W.—Situated 8 miles W. of Lexington. Cedar Grove, P. O. 145 ms. N. W. of R.—Situated ten miles N. E. of Lexington. It contains 2 mercantile stores, and 1 manufacturing flour mill. Fairfield, P. O. 144 ms. from R. and 186 from W.—Situated on one of the post routes from Lexington to Staunton, 13 ms. N. N. E. from the former, and 24 from the latter. It contains about 20 dwelling houses, 1 house of public worship, free for all denominations, 2 taverns, 1 mercantile store, 1 tanyard, 1 saddler, 2 boot and shoe factories, 2 house carpenters and 1 smith's shop. Population 130 persons; of whom 2 are physicians. Fancy Hill, P. O. 164 ms. from R. and 206 S. W. of W. It is pleasantly situated nine miles from Lexington, in a fertile and well watered country. It contains several dwelling houses, 1 mercantile store, 1 extensive tavern, well kept, and which receives much company in the summer season, and 1 tailor's shop. A physician resides here. Lebanon Forge, situated on the North fork of James river. These iron works, owned by Messrs. Mathews &amp; Bryan, are now in extensive operation, manufacturing pig metal into bar iron. The establishment consists of a forge, with a smith's shop and saw mill as appendages. The apparatus employed consists of three refining fires, one chafry which draws bar iron, and two forge hammers, weighing from five to six hundred weight each. The average amount manufactured at this forge, from the metal, or pigs, is one hundred and fifty tons of bar iron annually. It requires 225 tons of metal, or pigs, to make 150 tons of bar iron. The number of operatives necessarily employed at this establishment, in manufacturing the iron, are 35, and the aggregate number of persons supported by it are 70. Ten hands are employed in making the iron, 2 in the blacksmith's shop, 1 sawyer, 4 colliers, 8 wood cutters, 2 wood carriers, 1 wagoner, 5 farmers, 1 clerk and manager, and 1 overseer, the balance being women and children;—out of the 35 actively employed, 8 have families.— In the vicinity of this forge is a house of public worship, (Methodist,) and 1 manufacturing flour mill. One mile below this establishment is located Maburry's Iron Works, employing the same number of operatives as the one above, the same quantity of machinery, and manufacturing the same weight of bar iron annually. The country around is rich, and abounds with iron ore of the first quality. LEXINGTON, P. T. and Seat of Justice, 156 ms. N. W. of R. and 198 from W. in lat. 37° 14′ N. and long. 2° 21′ W. of W. C.—situated on a gentle ascent, a few rods from the north bank of the North river, a branch of James river, 10 miles above its junction, and 35 N. W. of Lynchburg. The act of Assembly of 1778, which authorised the formation of the county, also directed the location of this town. Its buildings, like those of all new towns, were constructed of wood. In 1794 they were nearly all destroyed by fire,—since that time, they have been erected of more durable materials, and with more regard to regularity. The number of houses it now contains, besides the ordinary county buildings, are about 150, mostly of brick, with 2 houses of public worship, (1 Presbyterian and 1 Methodist.) There are 8 mercantile stores, 4 taverns, 1 book store, 1 printing office, from which a weekly paper is issued, 2 tinplate works, 2 watch makers and silversmiths, 3 hatters, 2 wagon makers, 2 tanyards, 5 saddlers, 5 boot and shoe factories, 2 blacksmiths, 2 cabinet makers, 4 house carpenters and 1 bricklayer. Lexington was formerly the great thoroughfare to the west, from the more eastern parts of Virginia, and though other more direct routes have been established, it still continues to be much travelled, by wagons from Tennessee to Baltimore, &amp;c. laden with such articles, as will return an ample profit, besides defraying the expenses of transportation, &amp;c. such as beeswax, tallow, feathers, and other articles of produce. These wagons return laden with goods for the western merchants. In the vicinity of Lexington is a state arsenal, in which are deposited about 30,000 stand of arms, guarded by a Captain and 30 men. An Academy was incorporated in this town in 1782, under the name of Liberty Hall Academy; and in 1812 it was chartered as a college, called Washington College, from General Washington, who endowed it with 100 shares in the James river canal, which produced, in 1821, an annual income of $2,400. "This donation constitutes the only part of its funds that are now productive, and may be estimated at $25,000. Its other funds consist also of donations, one devised by a private citizen of Lexington, estimated at $50,000, when relieved from certain debts of the testator, and another from the Cincinnati Society of Virginia, on their voluntary dissolution, amounting to $15,000, but not yet drawn out of the hands in which it was deposited; making in all $90,000." There are two buildings of brick, which afford accommodations for 50 or 60 students; and a library of 1,500 volumes. It is pleasantly situated; its expenses for education are not high; but its students have never been very numerous.—Number in 1833, 46. A large, handsome and capacious brick building has lately been erected, intended for the philosophical apparatus, &amp;c. which are sufficiently ample. The faculty consists of a president, two professors, and a tutor. Ann Smith Academy is also located in this town for the education of young ladies. It occupies a large and handsome edifice, in which are teachers of all the requisite branches of such an institution. There are three public libraries in this town. Population not given in the tabular returns of the last census, but supposed to be about 900 persons; of whom 9 are attorneys, and 4 regular physicians. County Courts are held on the Monday before the 1st Tuesday in every month;—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery are held on the 16th of April and September, by Judge Thompson. Natural Bridge, P. O. 172 ms. S. W. of R. and 213 S. W. by W. of W.—situated in the southern part of the county, in lat. 37° 33′ N. and long. 2° 34′ W. of W. C. We present a faithful description of this extraordinary natural curiosity from the notes of a traveller, published not long since in the periodical press. "By the uniform admission of all those who have visited this great natural curiosity, it has justly acquired a celebrity unequalled by any other in this country, and the increasing number of visiters to this place, still continues to awaken the attention of the curious and philosophic throughout the world. Its location is in the county of Rockbridge, to which it gives name, 15 miles from Lexington, and 45 from Lynchburg, through one of which places it is usually approached by strangers. The mean height of the bridge, from the stream running underneath it to its upper surface, is 215 feet 6 inches, its average width is 80 feet, its length, measured across from the indentations on either side of the high and nearly perpendicular rocks upon which it rests, is 93 feet, and its thickness, on both sides, is 55 feet. The stupendous arch constituting the bridge is of lime stone rock, covered to the depth of from 4 to 6 feet with alluvial and clayey earth, and based upon huge rocks of the same geological character, the summits of which are 90 feet, and their bases 50 feet asunder, and whose rugged sides form the wild and awful chasm spanned by the bridge. The bridge is guarded, as if by the design of nature, by a parapet of rocks, and by trees and shrubbery, firmly embedded in the soil, so that a person travelling the stage road running over it, would, if not informed of the curiosity, pass it unnoticed. It is also worthy of remark, that the creation of a natural bridge at this place has contributed, in a singular manner, to the convenience of man, inasmuch as the deep ravine over which it sweeps, and through which traverses the beautiful "Cedar Creek," is not, otherwise, easily passed for several miles, either above or below the bridge; and, consequently, the road running from north to south with an aclivity of 35 degrees, presents the same appearance in soil, growth of trees and general character, with that of the neighboring scenery. The bridge is not to be seen, therefore, in its native grandeur and sublimity by passing over or around it, but only from a position nearly under it, or within the valley near by. The first view commonly obtained by strangers of the bridge, or its contiguous scenery, is by an eager approach to the edge of the bridge, or to the brink of the right of it, &amp; looking over into the gulf below. Here language is incapable of expressing the emotions with which the scene is viewed, nor is it possible for the imagination to sketch the scene in a manner to equal the reality. The spectator becomes suddenly and forcibly impressed with the apparent danger of his situation, and trembling with fear, he involuntary shrinks back and crouches to the earth. As he approaches the brink of the precipice, his eye is attracted to the broad mass of perpendicular rock upon the opposite side of the chasm, and as he nears the jutting crags and throws the sight along down the wild and rugged sides, now boldly opposed to his view,—straining with anxious gaze to find a resting place, still perceiving no termination to the yawning abyss, a shuddering horror comes over him, and a wild delirium seizes his senses, and he unconsciously recoils from the unfathomable gloom, and the awful gulf below him! Hastening from the spot, he becomes conscious only of the irresistible influence of the mind over the body, on recognizing himself removed from the scene of danger, still he is haunted by the ideas to which the scene has given birth, and which, resting unwillingly upon his mind, often lash his feelings into agonies! Such are, indeed, the perceptions and reflections of those of lively sensibility and active cautiousness, who, for the first time, visit this wonderful and magnificent scenery; yet there are those who view it with apparent insensibility and unconsciousness, and who steadily look down into the abyss, "yet never suffer joint to tremble." This view of "the great natural curiosity" however, is but partial, and even yet, incapable of calling up those ideas of sublimity and greatness which are afforded the spectator by another position. Turning around the elevated ground north of the bridge, and coming gradually along to its southern base, then winding around an abrupt point of the hill, the anxious spectator is brought into a foot path declining along the rocks, beside the cliff on the one side and the busy little creek on the other, when, suddenly looking upward, he beholds the splendid arch of the bridge in all its sublimity and natural grandeur. Here indeed, does the astonished observer find language too feeble to give utterance to his impressions! —"Fancy then; Unequal fails beneath the task, Ah! what shall language do?" Mute astonishment succeeds the emotions with which the stranger had before been impressed, and now, unconsciously fixed to the spot, he gazes with wonder and admiration upon the lofty arch, springing like a spirit over the tremendous gulf, and throwing its massive sides and etherial summit high against the heavens. No adequate idea of the "Natural Bridge" is to be obtained from the efforts of either the pencil or pen, and though both have attempted a description, yet neither have approximated reality. From this view, the beholder is led to the comparison of natural objects with which he has been familiar, and himself shrinks into insignificance when he becomes the subject Never was there a more fit place to observe the littleness of man, and the omnipotence of God!—No reflective mind can, with such a scene presented to its faculties, remain unimpressed with its own nothingness, and unaffected by feelings of adoration to the Great Supreme. With this view of the subject before him, and "looking from nature up to nature's God," the language of the poet would not appear to him inapt:— In the vast and the minute we see The unambitious footsteps of the God Who gives the lustre to an insect's wing, And wheels his throne upon the rolling world. The relative position of the spectator, at this time, and place, in regard to the bridge and most of the stupendous scenery connected with it, is decidedly more favorable than any other. Here within one grand view, is the towering arch surmounted by high trees, with vigorous foliage and sharp projecting rocks, strongly implanted in the soil. Here the whole of the high, and apparently unsupported mass, is cast boldly against the field of deep blue sky, and thereby brought out in vivid contrast and grand relief, every object stands strongly pourtrayed upon the broad etherial canvass, while the varied tints, the sweeping dashes of natural shades, the coarse masses of deep black, with the occasional brushes of strong lights, all are well defined and deeply toned within the rugged outlines, compose, en masse, the most magnificent and finished picture that ever came from the hand of nature. —Who can paint Like nature? Can imitation boast, Amidst his gay creation, hues like hers? Here too, on either side, the precipitous cliffs rise up in portentous grandeur with Pendant rocks that nod into the world, And mock our eyes with air The observer, anxious to get a view of the whole of this rude and romantic scenery, naturally traverses the ravine, yet fearfully overawed by the impending rocks, he feels in momentary danger of being ground to dust by the falling of projecting rocks, but which, though held apparently by feeble tenure, have maintained their places for ages. On looking up from under the bridge, the fear of destruction from the overhanging mass becomes almost irresistible, yet the grandeur of the arch induces sufficient curiosity to forego the apparent danger. The bridge here presents its most imposing appearance, though its character is less sublime from the nature of the position. The beholder is here more forcibly struck with awe and terror than from any other situation in which it is viewed. The expansive dimensions, the grand oversweeping continuity, and the ponderous massiveness of the entire rock are here forcibly displayed to the wondering gaze. Here also, running up beside you to the very arch, are the craggy abutments upon which it rests, presenting altogether, the hugest body of continuous rock ever at one time thrown open to view. Speculation is naturally put in operation to account for the causes whereby "with disruption vast," this rock was cloven asunder. Although scientific men may differ in many particulars upon this subject, and although it is both more common and more easy to say that the whole is a phenominon caused "by some great convulsion," than to assign reasons and determine causes for this phenomenon, yet, it is thought, no one who has investigated the causes most likely to produce this result, and the evidences which those causes have left behind, of their existence and operation, will arrive at any other conclusion than that the principle cause was water. It will be observed that the eastern or upper side of the bridge, has been worn under for several feet, that the part thus rounded, tunnel-like, is smooth and unlike any other portion of the contiguous rock, if we except the indentation on the southern side of the perpendicular rock, which present similar appearances, evidently produced from the same cause.— Viewing the course of the ravine, and the consequent direction of the water which filled it, the indication of the agency of water in the formation of the bridge, is even more determinate in the latter circumstance than in the former. The projecting body of rock upon the opposite side of the chasm, running uniformly upward from its base, and opposing an invulnerable front, of sufficient magnitude to have turned the current of the mighty waters, and to have thrown its force directly against those parts upon the other side, where the peculiarities before mentioned are seen, affords the most natural proof of the influence of water in the creation of the bridge. Those who have observed the operation of water in the wearing away of rocks, the large and deep pot holes, the rounded and smooth surfaces given to rocks, by the long and continued action of small stones, and the friction of water, will here observe similar appearances. The entire mass of rock is of limestone, and therefore more easily worn away than silicious stone; whose more indurated surfaces have fretted for ages against it. Besides these evidences of the agency of water, there are in the neighborhood of the bridge, numerous and certain proofs of there having been vast bodies of water which poured down the surrounding vallies and ravines, overtopping some of the high hills, and embodying themselves, at last, within this grand reservoir. The magnificent and rocky sides of this great depository, which is of nearly uniform height for some two or three miles above, directed the accumulated waters down against the firm bridge. Here they are met with this bold obstruction throwing itself proudly athwart the rushing waters, as if saying, in a spirit of defiance, "thus far thou shalt come and no farther!" Forced from its course by this obstinate and haughty barrier, the overflowing current was turned round the declivity on the south, and ran down the hill about the points of rocks, and came again into the deep valley some thirty rods below. Along its diverted channel may be seen all the evidences of a water course pouring over a rocky bed. The proudly opposing rock was not destined, however, to stop forever the march of the dashing stream, and in process of time, the onward force of the current, with the means which it had brought to its aid, prevailed, and increasing its force with every advantage, the breach enlarged and admitted, at length, the stream to roll forward for ages unresisted. Upon the summit of distant hills are to be found marine fossils, and their impressions within the fragments of partially decomposed limestone rocks, while along their sides and within the vallies are pot-holes, smooth fissures and rounded points of rocks, all of which prove the existence and action of water at these places at some period of time; the course and parallel of these indications, are also directed towards the great receptacle as before intimated. (The undulating surface of the surrounding country must have presented from the bridge, when thus admitting the varied streams to dash along its vallies, one of the most splendid scenes in nature.) The chasms, both east and west of the bridge, do not afford strong evidences of the continued action of water, but rather of some violent rending of the massive rock. And this may be rationally supposed, without opposing the conclusions to which we have arrived in regard to the agency of water in the formation of the bridge; yet even this is reconcileable with the solution of this phenomenon, by supposing portions of the rock to have fallen, from time to time, by the action of water within the fissures, or to have been cleft off by objects carried forcibly down the current of the stream. The theory of an immense cavern terminated at the bridge, and opening from either side, is certainly plausible, and does not militate against that so manifestly true, in respect to the bridge. The summit of this cavern is supposed to have extended along the ravine and high precipitous rocks, for some distance, and eventually to have fallen down, by which the deep chasm is laid open to view. This is believed by some, at least, whose judgment and scientific knowledge are entitled to the utmost respect. It may appear to the curious worthy of remark, that in the centre of the grand arch, under the bridge, there is to be observed with outspread wings, the American Eagle of gigantic size, covering with one of its wings, the head of the British Lion. These objects certainly appeared plainly delineated to the writer, as they have ever appeared to all to whom they have been pointed out. Others have also discovered the head of Washington and various other objects, but which it was not permitted to the ken of the writer to discover. These appearances are formed by moss hanging from the high overhanging arch. To this arch it has ever been the attempt of visiters to throw a stone, and we recollect it to have been stated, years gone by, that the only successful competitor, in this feat of physical power was General Washington, who, it was also said, cut his name higher than any other person, upon the perpendicular rock. It is, certainly, a feat requiring no common degree of personal strength to throw a stone to the bridge, and few have been successful in the attempt; though one individual is said to have thrown upon the very summit, (probably with a sling,) from whence the stone was taken at the time. Names are to be seen "in every variety" along the rocks and upon the sides under the bridge, but that of Washington is not now to be discovered. A young man, it is said ambitious to cut his name above that of Washington, became so situated, up the towering cliff, that he was unable to recover himself, or to descend: to effect the one, he would inevitably incur the certainty of being precipitated to the bottom, while to climb still higher and gain the top, appeared impossible. In this state of awful uncertainty, between the possibility of life and a dreadful death, little hope appeared to the one, while the other seemed certain, and urged by an effort as desperate as the love of life, he attempted to ascend to the giddy height. This alternative nerved him with more than mortal power, and strange as it may seem to every one who may ever look at the spot from whence he started, the shuddering height at which he aimed, and the apparent impossibilities he surmounted, he arrived nervless and prostrate at the verge, and—was safe. Visiters to the "Natural Bridge of Virginia," will ever find a rich and varied field for observation; for, in addition to the objects of curiosity which have been enumerated and de- scribed, "the overhanging rocks" and numerous other grand and interesting objects up the valley and within the neighborhood, there is "Powell's mountain," upon which are found the marine fossils before mentioned, and within which are "Johnson's cave," affording an easy descent among a variety of subterranean cavities, and "Chapin's cave" of yet unfathomable depth. And last, though not least, among the objects of consideration with visiters to these interesting and romantic scenes, Mr. Johnson, the gentlemanly and accommodating proprietor of the public house at the bridge, will afford every facility for their observation and every means for their enjoyment." Panther's Gap, P. O. 195 ms. S. W. of W. and 154 from R. In the vicinity of this post office, the Blowing cave is situated. This natural curiosity is situated 12 ms. S. E. of the Warm Springs, in the ridge which divides the Cow and Calfpasture. It is a large cavity in the side of a hill, of about 6 feet in diameter, and emits constantly a current of air. This current is strongest in dry frosty weather, and in long spells of rain weakest. Regular inspirations and expirations of air, by caverns and fissures have been probably enough accounted for, by supposing them combined with intermitting fountains, as they must of course inhale air, while their reservoirs are emptying themselves, and again emit it while they are filling. But a constant issue of air, only varying in its force as the weather is dryer or damper, will require a new hypothesis. There is another Blowing cave in the Cumberland mountains, about a mile from where it crosses the Carolina line, all we know of this is, that it is not constant, and that a fountain of water issues from it. ROCKINGHAM. Rockingham was established by act of Assembly in 1778, and formed from a portion of Augusta county. It is bounded N. by Shenandoah,—N. E. by Page,—E. by the Blue Ridge which separates it from Orange and Albemarle,—S. by Augusta,—W. by the North mountain which separates it from Pendleton,—and N. W. by Hardy. Its mean length is 34? miles, mean breadth 24; and area 833 square miles. Its mean lat. is 37° 30′ N. and long. 1° 45′ W. of W. C. The main Shenandoah runs through the eastern portion of the county,—North river drains the southern part,— North Fork of Shenandoah drains the northern and northwestern portion and after running through Shenandoah it unites with the main branch soon after it enters Frederick, a few miles from Front Royal,—Smith's creek a branch of North Fork drains the central portion of the county, and passes into Shenandoah before it joins North Fork. The western part of this county is very mountainous, and the Peaked mountains run up from Shenandoah, between the Shenandoah and Harrisonburg. Much of the soil is excellent, and the farming econominal and judicious. A large portion of the population is German or of German origin. Population in 1820, 14,784—1830, 20,683.

W. by W. of W., in lat. 38° 25′ and long. 1° 48′ W. of W. C. situated 24 ms. N. N. E. of Staunton and 40 N. N. W. of Charlottesville. This village contains besides the ordinary county buildings, 125 dwelling houses, a neat brick market house lately erected, 2 houses of public worship, (1 Methodist, and 1 Presbyterian,) 3 common schools, 1 temperance and 1 sunday school society, 8 mercantile stores, 3 taverns, and 1 printing office, issuing a weekly paper. There are 2 tan yards, 4 saddlers, 4 boot and shoe factories, 3 smith shops, 3 hatters, 2 tailors, 2 wagon makers, 2 gunsmiths, 2 wheelwrights and chair makers, 1 cabinet maker, 2 coppersmiths, and tin plate workers, 1 saddle-tree maker, 1 glove maker, 1 bookbindery, 2 watchmakers and silversmiths, 1 marble cutter and polisher, a quarry of which is in the immediate neighborhood, and in considerable demand, 1 confectionary, and 1 earthen ware pottery. There is a fine spring of strong limestone water in the public square,—and the land adjacent is a strong limestone soil. Deaton is 4 miles from this place, and Edom Mills are 5 miles distant; they are both small but flourishing places; as is also Mount Crawford, at which considerable business is done both mechanical and mercantile. These three having sprung up within a few years under the auspices of men of capital and enterprise, together with other causes have rendered Harrisonburg less prosperous than villages in this valley generally. Population about 1000 persons; of whom 8 are resident attorneys, and 8 regular physicians. County courts are held on the 3d Monday in every month;—Quarterly in February, May, August, and November. Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery are held on the 10th of May and 11th of October by Judge Smith. Kite's Mills, P. O. 131 ms. from R. and 122 W. of W. Linville Creek, P.

W. by W. of W. situated in the western part of the county, on the main valley road leading from Winchester to Staunton, and immediately on the North river. It contains 25 dwelling houses, 1 house of public worship free for all denominations, 2 common schools, 2 taverns, 3 mercantile stores, 2 tailors, 2 saddlers, 2 boot and shoe factories, 1 smith shop, 1 tin plate worker, 1 cabinet maker, 1 wheelwright, 1 cooper, 1 pottery, 2 milliner and mantua makers, 1 gun smith, 1 wagon maker, 1 manufacturing flour mill, and 1 saw mill. The North river is navigable for flat boats, about three miles above this village, and considerable quantities of flour are annually carried down the Shenandoah from this place to Georgetown and Alex- andria. The surrounding country is fertile and the climate salubrious. Population 180 persons; of whom 1 is a physician. Port Republic, P. V. 121 ms. from R. and 143 N. W. by W. of W. situated at the junction of the North and South rivers, branches of the Shenandoah, 2 ms. below the Augusta line, 2½ from Weyer's cave, 12 ms. S. of Harrisonburg, 20 E. of Staunton, and 32 north of Charlottesville. It contains 30 dwelling houses, 1 house of public worship, free for all denominations, 1 common school, 1 house of entertainment, 2 mercantile stores, 1 manufacturing flour mill, 3 saw mills, 2 tan yards, 1 tilt hammer shop, with a carriage manufactory attached, 2 other smith shops, 1 tin plate worker, 3 boot and shoe factories, 1 saddler, 1 cabinet maker, 1 turner and chair maker, 1 hatter, and 2 tailors. The Shenandoah is navigable for flat boats from Port Republic to the District of Columbia, running at all times (except at very dry seasons) with from 60 to 120 barrels of flour in each boat. Both branches of the river furnish admirable seats for machinery, and the water power is sufficient at all seasons for manufactories of any common extent. Population 160 persons, of whom 1 is a physician. Smith's Creek, P. O. 140 ms. from R. and 130 S. W. of W., situated in the northern part of the county. The creek is the extreme southern branch of the North Fork of the Shenandoah. RUSSELL. Russell was established by act of Assembly in 1786, and formed from a portion of Washington county. It is bounded by Tazewell N. E.—by Clinch mountain separating it from Smyth E.—S. E. by the same mountain, separating it from Washington,—S. and S. W. by Scott,—and by the Cumberland mountain separating it from Pike county, Ky., N. W. Its mean length is 40 miles, mean breadth 34¼, and area 1,370 square miles. It lies between 36° 38′ and 37° 30′ N. lat. and 4° 43′ and 5° 41′ W. long. from W. C. Mountains, &amp;c.—The Clinch, which divides it from Washington and Smyth on the south; the Cumberland on the north separating it from Kentucky, are the most prominent. Their general bearing is from N. E. to S. W. Between the waters which fall into the Clinch and the tributaries of Sandy, and only a few miles north of the Clinch, (with a few exceptions on the Guess' river, and a short distance east of it,) until you arrive at the Cumberland mountain, the country seems to be a congregation of mountains. Their sides are generally steep,—the valleys narrow,— most of them of not much greater extent than the space which is occupied by the meandering streams which, overhung with laurel, pass on in silent obscurity to their respective destinations. A few scattered inhabitants are occasionally to be seen here, who cultivate a small strip of land on a watercourse, and follow the chase on the mountains, as the means of subsistence. Amongst these mountains there are excellent ranges for cattle and hogs, which continues throughout the year except in the more severe freezes and snows of winter. Travelling here must be performed either by following the hunter's path on the mountains, with but few places of safe descent, or pursuing the watercourses; it being impracticable, with a few exceptions, to cross the mountains with the view of a direct approach from one point to another. There are two ranges of highland, running nearly parallel with each other and the Clinch mountain,—one between Mocasin creek and Copper creek, denominated Mocasin ridge,—the other between Copper creek and Clinch river, called Copper ridge. These ridges are cut by Big Cedar creek, east of which the former is denominated the Chesnut ridge and Preec's mountain, and the latter the River, and House and Barn mountain. Kent's ridge lies between the Maiden Spring Fork and North Fork of Clinch river; and north of the latter is the Stone mountain. The Big Butt north of Clinch river, is a high projection of one of the mountains separating the waters of Clinch and Sandy. Rivers, Creeks, &amp;c.—Clinch river, which meanders across the county in a N. E. and S. W. direction, is the principal stream, but has not as yet been used for transporting produce to the west, or for other purposes of navigation. This river affords an abundance of fish, some varieties of which are quite delicious. The North Fork (of Clinch) and the Maiden Spring Fork which take their rise in Tazewell county, unite their waters in the eastern section of Russell. Guess' river, which divides Russell and Scott has various sources from spurs of the Cumberland and adjoining mountains, and flows in a southern direction into the Clinch, receiving in its course Tom's creek on the south, and Bull Run, two of its principal streams. Copper creek has its source from numerous fine springs filled with yellow gravel, rising a few miles east of the village at Dickensonville, and passes on to the southwest, uniting with Clinch river in Scott county. Moccasin creek rises near a gap in Clinch mountain by that name, flows near its base in a fruitful valley, and passing through Big Mocasin Gap, falls into the North Fork of Holston: Cedar creek is formed by streams issuing from the Clinch, Preec's, and the House and Barn mountains, it flows in a western-direction till within 2 miles east of Lebanon receiving little Cedar creek which passes the village, and then flows into the Clinch in a northern direction. Indian creek runs from the eastern end or termination of Preec's mountain and from the spurs of Clinch mountain, and flows in a north east and north direction into the Clinch river. Lewis' creek, Thompson's creek, Weaver's creek, and Dump's creek, are inconsiderable streams, falling into Clinch river on the north; and Cedar Spring, Beck's branch, Mill creek, and Castle Run on the south. The principal streams of the Sandy is the Louisa Fork in the northeastern section, running nearly north west; The Pound Fork (so called from a bend in the river resembling somewhat in shape a horse shoe) takes its rise towards the Guess' river, runs east near to Cumberland mountain and unites, with McClure's Fork, and afterwards Russell's Fork at the state line of Kentucky. There is a remarkable cascade upon Big Cedar creek. In its passage through Copper ridge its waters are precipitated over a rock of considerable height, and they then wander in a circuitous route of many miles to seek a union with the Clinch river, which here runs at a short distance from it by a direct line, and which also rolls over a very shoally and serpentine channel above and below their junction, and at one place is very narrow and rapid, occasioned by the projection of rocks from the north side. The whole county occupies an elevated region, independent of the mountain ridges, from 1,200 to 1,500 feet above the ocean tides. Roads.—By a late act of Assembly a road has been established on the joint stock plan, leading from Price's turnpike in Botetourt to Cumberland Gap, which will pass through Lebanon. Its route was surveyed by the Engineer to cross Copper ridge, 3 miles west of Lebanon, and through Castles' Woods, into Scott, &amp;c. Its location by the Copper creek valley so as to cross Copper ridge in Scott county, is strongly recommended by some, and the people on both routes are engaged with spirit in working out the respective advantages. The road from Lebanon to Abingdon passes by the way of Little Mocasin Gap,—that to the Salt Works in Washington, and Smyth, by Hayter's Gap,—that to Scott C. H. (Estillville,) either by Dickensonville, or down the valley of Mocasin Creek. A road has been opened along the Louisa Fork of Sandy, as a line of communication with Kentucky, aided by an appropriation from the State of $3000; but it was so injudiciously located and badly constructed, that it is almost impassable. A track has also been opened from Castle Woods, via Guess' river and the Pound Fork of Sandy, to the State of Kentucky, passing Cumberland mountain, communicating with Pike and Perry counties, Ky. Meeting Houses.—The Episcopalians, Methodists, and Baptists have about 12 meeting houses in this county, besides various other places of meeting at private houses. There is no other sect having a congregation, society or church. The Methodists are the more numerous body of christians. Manufactures.—There are no merchant mills (properly speaking) in Russell. Hendrick's on Cedar creek is the best establishment of that kind; flour from it is sometimes sent down the Holston and Tennessee to Huntsville. There are no factories of iron, wool, or cotton in this county, except carding machines, although there are many sites suitable for water power. Capital, and an opening for market, are wanting to give encouragement to these branches of industry. Productions.—This county having many parcels of rich and fertile soil, produces in abundance most of the necessaries of life. Indian corn, wheat, rye, oats clover, and the grasses introduced, succeed well; but its distance from market and the late neglected state of improvement of the roads, have hitherto compelled the farmer to rear stock as the principal means of advancing his estate. There are several quarries of marble not far distant from Lebanon, of a greyish complexion. It is used for tomb stones, and for the fronts of hearths. Some specimens of it have been taken to the South. The lime stone is a prevailing mineral in the southern section of this county; amongst it are found many caverns, few of which, however, are of much notoriety. There are two remarkable rocks upon the range of mountain between Clinch river and the upper waters of Big Cedar creek in the eastern part of the county; the one from its form is called a house, and the other a barn, and hence the name of the House and Barn mountain. Several extensive beds of iron ore exist in this county, but are not at present worked. Stone coal is found in some of the ravines north of Clinch river, and is deemed of excellent quality by the blacksmiths who use it. This county had its name in honor of Gen'l William Russell, who formerly resided on an estate of about 600 acres in Castles Woods, but who at the time of his death lived near to and had an interest in Preston's old Salt works, in Washington county, now Smyth. The principal population of this county is contained between Clinch mountain and a distance of from 12 to 15 miles north of its base: the northern and greater portion of its territory being so mountainous, sterile, and inconvenient of access, that the population is, and will be for many years hence, very inconsiderable. There are several rich and valuable sections of land in this county: the principal are, Gilmer's Settlement, between Lebanon and Big Cedar creek,—Elk Garden, in the vicinity of Hayter's Gap,—Castle's Woods, between Copper ridge and Clinch, west of Lebanon,—and the Mocasin Valley, lying between a ridge of that name and Clinch mountain opposite and below Little Mocasin Gap. In these sections the first settlements of the country were made. Professions.—There are two resident attornies in the county, one living in the village at Lebanon, and the other in the country;—one resident physician in Lebanon and two in the country: but the exemption heretofore of this section of the State from many of the diseases prevalent more frequently in other places; and the scarcity of litigation in the Courts, have not presented either to the one or the other, the prospect of much gain from a reliance upon their respective professions. Early Traditions.—In this part of Virginia, as in most other frontier settlements, the first settlers encountered many hardships, and experienced many scenes of dreadful suffering from the hostile Indians, who made frequent incursions from beyond the Ohio river for purposes of plunder, or savage revenge. In these incursions the most tragic scenes of cold blooded butchery were acted, and the survivors sometimes carried into a captivity more painful and distressing than the excruciating deaths to which their relatives had been subjected. Many well authenticated accounts of these cruelties, and of hair-breadth escapes, are still preserved. We give in a note* * A NARRATIVE of the Captivity and Escape of Mrs. Frances Scott, of Washington county, Va. On Wednesday, the 29th day of June, 1785, late in the evening, a large company of armed men passed the house on their way to Kentucky; some part of whom encamped within two miles. Mr. Scott, living on a frontier part, generally made the family watchful; but on this calamitous day, after so large a body of men had passed, he lay down in his bed and imprudently left one of the doors of his house open; the children were also in bed and asleep. Mrs. Scott was nearly undressed, when to her unutterable astonishment and horror, she saw rushing in through the door that was left open, painted savages with presented arms, raising a hideous shriek. Mr. Scott, being awake, instantly jumped from his bed, but was immediately fired at; he forced his way through the middle of the enemy and got out of the door, but fell a few paces from thence. An Indian seized Mrs. Scott, and ordered her to a particular spot and not to move; others stabbed and cut the throats of the three youngest children in their bed, and afterwards lifted them up and dashed them on the floor near the mother; the eldest, a beautiful girl of eight years old, awoke and escaped out of the bed and ran to her mamma with the most plaintive accents, cried, "O mamma! mamma! save me!"—the mother in the deepest anguish of spirit, and with a flood of tears, entreated the savages to spare her child: but with a brutal fierceness they tomahawked and stabbed her in the mother's arms. Adjacent to Mr. Scott's dwelling-house another family lived of the name of Ball. The Indians also attacked them at the same instant they did Mr. Scott; but the door being shut, the enemy fired into the house through an opening between two logs, and killed a lad, and then essayed to force the door open: but a surviving brother fired through the door, and the enemy desisted and went off, the remaining part of the family ran out of the house and escaped. In Mr. Scott's were four good rifles loaded, belonging to people that had left them on their way to Kentucky.—The Indians loaded themselves with the plunder, being thirteen in number, then speedily made off, and continued travelling all night; next morning their chief allotted to each man his share, and detached nine of the party to steal horses from the inhabitants on Clinch. The eleventh day after Mrs. Scott's captivity, four Indians that had her in charge stopped at a place fixed on for rendezvous, and to hunt, being now in great want of provisions. Three went out, and the chief being an old man was left to take care of the prisoner, who by this time expressed a willingness to proceed to the Indian towns, which seemed to have the desired effect of lessening her keeper's vigilance. In the daytime while the old man was graining a deer skin, the captive, pondering on her situation, and anxiously looking for an opportunity to make her escape, took a resolution and went to the Indian carelessly: asked liberty to go to a small distance to a stream of water to wash the blood off her apron, that had remained besmeared since the fatal night of the murder of her little daughter. He told her in the English tongue, "go along;" she then passed by him, his face being in a contrary direction from that she was going, and he very busy. She, after getting to the water, proceeded on without delay, made to a high barren mountain, and travelled until late in the evening, when she came down into the valley in search of the track she had been taken along; hoping thereby to find the way back, without the risk of being lost and perishing with hunger in uninhabited parts. On coming across the valley to the river side,—supposed to be the easterly branch of Kentucky river—she observed in the sand, tracks of two men that had gone up the river and had just returned. She concluded these to have been her pursuers, which excited emotions of gratitude and thankfulness to Divine Providence for so timely a deliverance. Being without any provisions, having no kind of weapon or tool to assist her in getting any, and almost destitute of clothing—also knowing that a vast tract of rugged high mountains intervened between where she was and the inhabitants easterly, and she almost as ignorant as a child of the method of steering the woods, excited painful sensations. But certain death, either by hunger or wild beasts, seemed to be better than to be in the power of beings who excited in her mind such horror.—She addressed Heaven, and taking courage proceeded onward. After travelling three days, she had nearly met with the Indians, as she supposed, that had been sent to Clinch to steal horses, but providentially hearing their approach, concealed herself among the cane until the enemy had passed.—This giving her a fresh alarm, and her mind being filled with consternation, she got lost, proceeded backwards and forwards for several days; at length she came to a river that seemed to come from the east—concluding it was Sandy river, she accordingly resolved to trace it to its source, which is adjacent to the Clinch settlement. After proceeding up the same several days, she came to where the river runs through the great Laurel mountain, where is a prodigious waterfall, and high craggy cliffs along the wateredge; that way seemed impassable, the mountain steep and difficult;—however, our mournful traveller concluded the latter way was best.—She therefore ascended for some time, but coming to a range of lofty and inaccessible rocks, she turned her course towards the foot of the mountain and the river side; after getting into a deep gulley, and passing over several high steep rocks, she reached the river side, where to her inexpressible affliction she found that a perpendicular rock, or rather one that hung over, of fifteen or twenty feet high, formed the bank.—Here a solemn pause ensued; she essayed to return, but the height of the steeps and rocks she had descended over prevented her. She then returned to the edge of the precipice, and viewing the bottom of it as the certain spot to end all her troubles, or remain on the top to pine away with hunger, or be devoured by beasts. After serious meditation and devout exercises, she determined on leaping from the height, and accordingly jumped off. Although the place she had to alight was covered with uneven rocks, not a bone was broken; but being exceedingly stunned by the fall, she remained unable to proceed for some space of time. The dry season caused the river to be shallow—she travelled in it, and, where she could, by its edge, until she got through the mountain, which she concluded was several miles. After this, as she was travelling along the bank of the river, a venomous snake bit her on the ancle; she had strength to kill it, and knowing its kind, concluded that death must soon overtake her. By this time, Mrs. Scott was reduced to a mere skeleton with fatigue, hunger, and grief, probably this state of her body was the means of preserving her from the effects of the poison; be that as it may, so it was, that very little pain succeeded the bite, and what little swelling there was, fell into her feet. Our wanderer now left the river, and after proceeding a good distance she came to where the valley parted into two, each leading a different course. Here a painful suspense again took place a forlorn creature, almost exhausted, and certain, if she was far led out of the way, she would never see a human creature. During this doubt, a beautiful bird passed close by her, fluttering along the ground, and went out of sight up one of the valleys. This drew her attention, and whilst considering what it might mean, another bird of the same appearance in like manner fluttered past her, and took the same valley the former had done. This determined her choice of the way; and in two days, which was on the 11th day of August, she reached the settlement on Clinch, called New Garden; whereas, (she is since informed by woodmen,) had she taken the other valley it would have led her back towards the Ohio. Mrs. Scott relates that the Indians told her that the party was composed of four different nations, two of whom she thinks they named Delawares and Mingoes. She further relates, that during her wandering from the 10th of July to the 11th of August, she had no other subsistence but chewing and swallowing the juice of young cane stalks, sassafras leaves, and some other plants she did not know the names of; that on her journey she saw buffaloes, elks, deers, and frequently bears and wolves— not one of which, although some passed very near her, offered her the least harm. One day a bear came near her with a young fawn in his mouth, and on discovering her he dropped his prey and ran off. Hunger prompted her to go and take the flesh and eat it; but on reflection she desisted, thinking that the bear might return and devour her—besides, she had an aversion to taste raw flesh. an example of the sufferings and heroism displayed by the early settlers, in the narrative of Mrs. Scott of Powell's Valley, which is now in Lee county, but which was formerly in Russell, and before its formation, in Washington county, which was published in the New Haven Gazette of Dec. 27th, 1785. Population in 1820, 5,536—in 1830, 6,714. This county belongs to the fifteenth judicial circuit and eighth district. Tax paid in 1833, $668 60— in 1834 on lots, $22 54—on land, $247 00—366 slaves, $91 50—3301 horses, $198 06—23 studs, $103 00—7 carryalls, $7 00—Total, $669 98. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $418 44—in 1833, $485 64. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Bichley's Mills, P. O. situated in Castle's Woods. Clifton, P. O. 312 ms. S. W. of R. and 374 from W., situated on the Maiden Spring Fork. Dickensonville, P. O. This village was formerly the seat of justice, but since that has been removed to Lebanon, it is almost depopulated, and the houses in a state of dilapidation. LEBANON, P. V. and seat of justice, 330 ms. from R. and 394 S. W. by W. of W., in lat 36° 53′ N. and long. 5° 03′ W. of W. C., situated about 130 ms. N. E. by E. of Knoxville, Ten., on Little Cedar creek, a branch of Clinch river having its source in Clinch mountain, on a southern inclination, near the centre of the population of the county. It is well watered by springs, and commands a beautiful prospect of Clinch mountain on the south, whose lofty summits present an almost unbroken range from Little Moccasin to Hayter's Gap, a distance of 12 miles. On the left of the latter gap, and directly east of this village, the mountain rises to a considerable height and is covered on the summit with evergreens,—amongst which is the balsam tree, from which a resinous substance is extracted, and which is celebrated as useful in the cure of chronic diseases. This village was located in 1816, and in 1818 the seat of justice was established here. The court house which is of stone, is the only permanent building in the place, the rest being all wooden tenements and most of them rather indifferent. It contains 6 mercantile stores, 1 grocery, 2 tan yards, 2 blacksmiths, 2 tailors, 1 hatter, 1 cabinet maker, and in the vicinity, 1 school house. The main road from Botetourt, thro' Montgomery and Giles to Cumberland Gap, passes through this village, and will when completed, contribute much to the prosperity of this place and the adjoining country. County Courts are held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery are held on the 3d Monday in April and September, by Judge Estill. SCOTT. Scott was established by act of Assembly in 1814, and formed from portions of Lee, Washington and Russell. It is bound N. and N. E. by Russell,—E. by Washington,—S. by Sullivan and Hawkins counties of Tennessee,—and W. by Lee. Its mean lat is about 46° 47′ N., its long. 5° 40′ W. of W. C.—its mean length 26 miles, mean breadth 24, and area 624 square miles. The face of the country is mountainous and uneven.—Clinch mountain passes through the county from N. E. to S. W.—all the principal ridges and streams take the same direction. The county is exceedingly well watered by good springs, creeks and rivers, and possesses water power in abundance. The soil is generally good, some of superior quality, the poorest well suited to small grain,—good meadows can be made almost any where. The county is well suited to rearing stock. The principal growth consists of poplar, hickory, beech, sugar maple, white and black oak, lynn, buckeye, black walnut; chesnut on the mountains and ridges, and wild cherry is found in many places. The chief productions are, Indian corn, wheat, rye, oats, hemp, flax, &amp;c. and apples and peaches in abundance. Many horses, horned cattle and hogs are reared in, and driven out of the county. Rivers, &amp;c.—The North fork of Holston and Clinch rivers, run through the county,—each afford the facilities of boat navigation down them in times of freshets; and with some improvement would add greatly to the convenience of the country for the purposes of trade; they both afford fine, fish. Clinch river, for a river of its size, is remarkable for its fish. Some of the largest taken in it are of the following weight:—blue cats, 30 to 40 lbs.— salmon, 15 lbs.—carp, 15 lbs.—red horse, 7 lbs. &amp;c. Big Mocasin Creek rises in Russell county at the foot of Clinch mountain—winds along the North side of the mountain, a distance of about 30 miles, to Big Mocasin Gap.—Little Mocasin creek rises at the foot of said mountain in a different direction, runs along the mountain a distance of about seven miles to said Gap, where the two streams form a junction, flow through the Gap on nearly level ground, and pass on to the North fork of Holston. Clinch mountain here is large and the Gap, although formed abruptly, is so perfectly level that the main western road in passing through it, does not ascend more than in passing up a gently flowing stream.—Big Mocasin Gap is situated about one mile east of Estillville. Sinking Creek empties into Clinch river about 22 miles north of Estillville, is 6 or 7 miles long, and large for its length. It rises on the south side of said river, in Copper ridge, and when it approaches within three-fourths of a mile of the river, sinks, passes under the bed of the river and rises about one hundred yards from the river on the north side, and runs back into the river,—the stream rising has often been proved to be the same that sinks.—Fish from the river pass into the mouth of the creek in the fall of the year in large numbers, winter under ground, and return to the river in the spring, when many are caught in a trap fixed between the rising water and river. Minerals, &amp;c.—Iron ore abounds in every part of the county—stone coal of good quality is found in many places—marble, considered coarse, abounds about Estillville—lime and free stone quarries are abundant—salt water has lately been discovered by boring at the distance of upwards of 56 300 feet below the surface, in the Poor Valley, near the North fork of Holston, and about 8 miles east of Estillville. The proprietor, Col. James White of Abingdon, is now letting down pipes and making preparations to work the well. The quality and quantity of the water is not yet fully ascertained in consequence of the interference of fresh water, which was struck first near the surface;—there however appears to be no doubt among those employed at the well but that it may be profitably worked. The Holston Springs, situated on the North fork of Holston, south of Estillville 2 miles, or 4 miles as the road runs, is considered by many to be not inferior to any springs in the state for the medicinal virtues of the water, but as yet has gained no great celebrity in consequence of the accommodations being inferior to those of most other watering places. The White Sulphur Springs, near the Rye Cove N. W. of Estillville 8 miles, is considered equal to the Catawba Springs in Washington county— There are many other Sulphur Springs in the county of less note. There are in the county, exclusive of the town of Estillville, 9 meeting houses, 6 of which belong to the Methodists and 3 to the Baptists,—the Methodists also have 18 or 20 other preaching places in the county, where they have societies formed and preach every other week—6 stores, 4 tanyards, 10 licensed houses of private entertainment, 4 hatter shops, 33 mills, some of which are very ordinary, others make good flour, but none are entitled to the appellation of merchant mill. To 10 or 15 of these mills, saw mills are attached,—and to two, carding machines. The climate is somewhat milder than that of Washington or Russell counties—vegetation commencing at Estillville one or two weeks sooner than at Abingdon or Lebanon. There is but one practicing attorney besides those residing in Estillville, and no regular physician. Population in 1820, 4,263—in 1830, 5,724. It belongs to the 15th judicial circuit and 8th district. Tax paid in 1833, $646 73—in 1834, on lots, $25 76—land, $273 95—180 slaves, $45 00—2032 horses, $121 92 —13 studs, $55 00—3 carryalls, $3 00—Total, $524 63. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $242 61—in 1833, $361 56. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. ESTILLVILLE, P. V. and seat of justice, 357 ms. S. W. of R. and 433 S. W. by W. of W. It contains besides the county buildings, 61 dwelling houses, 2 houses of public worship, (1 Methodist and 1 Presbyterian,) 1 academy, 1 common school and 1 female do., 4 mercantile stores, 2 tanyards, 2 saddlers, 3 blacksmiths, 1 extensive hat manufactory, 2 cabinet makers, several house carpenters, and various other mechanics. It is situated on Mocasin creek, between the N. fork of Holston and Clinch rivers, and 4 miles from the Holston Springs, which are now visited by much company, and said to be equalled by none except the Sweet Springs, to which they have a considerable resemblance. This place is supplied with water by means of pipes, through which it is brought 800 yards, and is conveyed to every dwelling. The water is of the purest and best quality. This place possesses some of the best water falls and sites for manufacturing establishments in Western Virginia, and other advantages not to be surpassed by any village in the state. The country around abounds with stone coal and iron ore, and salt water has lately been obtained in great quantity within 6 miles of the C. H. A. northern, southern, eastern and western mail arrives in this village once a week. Population 200 persons; of whom three are resident attorneys and two regular physicians. County Courts are held on the 1st Wednesday after the 2d Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, June, August, and November. Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery are held on the 2d Monday in April and September, by Judge Estill. Osborn Ford, P. O. 20 ms. north of Estillville. Pendleton, P. O. 367 ms. from R. and 443 from W.—Situated 12 ms. N. W. of Estillville. Stock Creek, P. O. 368 ms. from R. and 444 from W.—Situated 11 ms. W. of Estillville. The remarkable NATURAL TUNNEL is situated near this P. O. We present an account of this natural curiosity written by S. H. Long, Lieut. Col. U. S. Army originally from the Monthly American Journal of Geology, in which it was published in February, 1832. "The immediate locality of this tunnel is upon a small stream called Buck-eye, or Stock creek. This last name owes its origin to its valley having been resorted to by the herdsmen of the country, for the attainment of a good range, or choice pasture ground for their cattle. The creek rises in Powell's mountain, and is tributary to Clinch river, which it enters at the distance of between two and three miles below the tunnel. The aspect of the surrounding country, and especially of that to the northward of the tunnel, and constituting the southerly slope of the mountain just mentioned, is exceedingly diversified and broken, by elevated spurs and ridges, separated from each other by deep chasms, walled with cliffs and mural precipices, often presenting exceedingly narrow passes, but occasionally widening into meadows or bottoms of considerable extent. The mural precipices just mentioned, occur very frequently, bounding the valleys of the streams generally in this part of the country, and opposing ramparts of formidable height, and in many places utterly insurmountable. Such are the features peculiarly characteristic of Wild Cat Valley, the Valley of Copper Creek, of Powell's and Clinch rivers, and of numerous other streams of less note, all of which are situated within a few miles of the natural tunnel. "To form an adequate idea of this remarkable and truly sublime object, we have only to imagine the creek to which it gives a passage, meandering through a deep narrow valley, here and there bounded on both sides by walls or revetements of the character above intimated, and rising to the height of two or three hundred feet above the stream; and that a portion of one of these chasms, instead of presenting an open thorough cut from the summit to the base of the high grounds, is intercepted by a continuous unbroken ridge more than three hundred feet high, extending entirely across the valley, and perforated transversely at its base, after the manner of an artificial tunnel, and thus affording a spacious subterranean channel for the passage of the stream. "The entrance to the natural tunnel on the upper side of the ridge, is imposing and picturesque, in a high degree; but on the lower side, the grandeur of the scene is greatly heightened by the superior magnitude of the cliffs, which exceed in loftiness, and which rise perpendicularly—and in some instances in an impending manner—two to three hundred feet; and by which the entrance on this side is almost environed, as it were, by an amphitheatre of rude and frightful precipices. "The observer, standing on the brink of the stream, at the distance of about one hundred yards below the debouchure of the natural tunnel, has, in front, a view of its arched entrance, rising seventy or eighty feet above the water, and surmounted by horizontal stratifications of yellowish, white and grey rocks, in depth nearly twice the height of the arch. On his left, a view of the same mural precipice, deflected from the springing of the arch in a manner to pass thence in a continuous curve quite to his rear, and towering in a very impressive manner, above his head. On his right, a sapling growth of buck-eye, poplar, linden, &amp;c. skirting the margin of the creek, and extending obliquely to the right, and upward through a narrow, abrupt ravine, to the summit of the ridge, which is here, and elsewhere, crowned with a timber growth of pines, cedars, oaks, and shrubbery of various kinds. On his extreme right, is a gigantic cliff lifting itself up perpendicularly from the water's edge, to the height of about three hundred feet, and accompanied by an insulated cliff, called the chimney, of about the same altitude, rising in the form of a turret, at least sixty feet above its basement, which is a portion of the imposing cliff just before mentioned. "In order to give a more full description of the magnificent spectacle which forms the subject of this article, I shall transcribe some of the minutes taken from my private notes, whilst on the ground, but first I shall give an extract from a letter addressed to me by my friend P. C. Johnston, Esq. of Abingdon, in the adjoining county to Scott, a gentleman well acquainted with this interesting locality. " `The rocks through which Stock creek flows, are a light blue and gray limestone, of a subcrystalline character; the strata are nearly horizontal, and this arrangement of the strata is obvious for several miles northeastwardly; but in every other direction, very near the bridge, (natural tunnel,) they have the dip usual in the country to the S. E. at an angle generally of from 30° to 50°. This tunnel is near what I have believed to be the N.W. boundary of the transition formation, a little within it. I have not been able to discover any organic remains in the limestone there, or in the neighborhood. On the little projections of the rock which occur on the walls, near the lower (S.) end of the tunnel, a crystallized deposit is lodged, which you no doubt recollect, that seemed to my taste to be a mixture of saltpetre and alum. No attempt has been made to analyze it. The earth found near the upper (N.) extremity of the tunnel some years ago, (the first time I visited it,) afforded saltpetre. The crystallized deposit seems to be made from a stratum apparently not more than six inches thick, which is so high that it cannot be reached for examination. The growth of timber is such as is common in the neighboring country, white, red, spanish, black oaks, hickory, white walnut, dogwood, poplar, chesnut, birch, ironwood, some hemlock and pawpaw (asimina triloba) on the banks of the creek, and the edges of the cliffs fringed with cedar. On the creek, below the tunnel for two miles, is found that variety of ash called the fringe tree, (chionanthus virginica,) the long white fringe-like blossoms of which are so delightfully fragrant.'* * This plant, in the natural system, belongs to the oleaceæ, or olive tribe. The flowers of the olea fragrans are used for flavoring tea in China. We offer this hint to our readers who have access to the chionanthus.—Ed. The following passages are from my own private journal. `Saturday, Aug. 13, 1831. Having ascended Cove ridge, we turned aside from our route to visit the natural bridge, or tunnel, situated on Buckeye, or Stock creek, about a mile below the Sycamore camp,† † This designation has been given to a spot in the valley of the creek, where formerly stood a hollow sycamore (plantanus occidentalis) tree of an enormous size, the remains of which are still to be seen, and in the cavity of which, whilst it stood, fifteen persons are said to have encamped at the same time together. and about one and a half miles from a place called Rye cove, which occupies a spacious recess between two prominent spurs of Powell's mountain, the site of the natural tunnel being included within a spur of Coveridge, which is one of the mountain spurs just alluded to. Here is presented one of the most remarkable and attractive curiosities of its kind to be witnessed in this or any other country. The creek, which is about seven yards wide, and has a general course about S. 15 W. here passes through a hill elevated from two to three hundred feet above the surface of the stream, winding its way through a huge subterraneous cavern, or grotto, whose roof is vaulted in a peculiar manner, and rises from seventy or eighty feet above its floor. The sides of this gigantic cavern rise perpendicularly in some places to the height of fifteen or twenty feet, and in others, are formed by the springing of its vaulted roof immediately from its floor. The width of the tunnel varies from fifty to one hundred and fifty feet; its course is that of a continuous curve, resembling the letter S. first winding to the right as we enter on the upper side, then to the left, again to the right, and then again to the left, on arriving at the entrance on the lower side. Such is its peculiar form, that an observer, standing at a point about midway of its subterranean course, is completely excluded from a view of either entrance, and is left to grope in the dark through a distance of about twenty yards, occupying an intermediate portion of the tunnel. When the sun is near the meridian, and his rays fall upon both entrances, the light reflected from both extremities of the tunnel, contributes to mollify the darkness of this interior portion into a dusky twilight. " `The extent of the tunnel from its upper to its lower extremity, following its meanders, is about 150 yards, in which distance the stream falls about ten feet, emitting, in its passage over a rocky bed, an agreeable murmur, which is rendered more grateful by its reverberations upon the roof and sides of the grotto. The discharge of a musket produces a crash-like report, succeeded by a roar in the tunnel, which has a deafening effect upon the ear. " `The hill through which this singular perforation leads, descends in a direction from east to west, across the line of the creek, and affords a very convenient passage for a road which traverses it at this place, having a descent in the direction just mentioned, of about four degrees.' "The rocks found in this part of the country are principally sandstone and limestone, in stratifications nearly horizontal, with occasional beds of clay slate. A mixture of the two former frequently occurs among the alternations presented by these rocks. A variety of rock resembling the French burr, occurs in abundance on Butcher's fork, of Powell's river, about twenty miles northwardly of the natural tunnel. Fossils are more or less abundant in these and other rocks. Fossil bones of an interesting character have been found in several places. Saltpetre caves are numerous Coves, sinks and subterranean caverns are strikingly characteristic, not only of the country circumjacent to the natural tunnel, but of the region generally situated between the Cumberland mountain and the Blue Ridge or Apalachain mountain. Bituminous coal, with its usual accompaniments, abounds in the northerly parts of this region; and in the intermediate and southerly portions, iron, variously combined, often magnetic, together with talcose rocks, &amp;c. &amp;c. are to be met with in great abundance. "The mountains in this vicinity, long. 82° to 84° W. from Greenwich, lat. 35° to 36° N. are among the most lofty of the Alleghany range. Several knobs in this part of the range, among which may be enumerated the Roan, the Unaka, the Bald, the Black, and Powell's mountains, rise to the height of at least four thousand five hundred feet above tide." SHENANDOAH. Shenandoah was established by act of Assembly in 1772, from a portion of the county of Frederick under the name of Dunmore, from the name of Lord Dunmore, then Governor of Virginia; but in October 1777 after Lord Dunmore had taken a decided stand against the colonies in the contest with the mother country, one of the delegates from the county stated that his constituents no longer wished to live in, or he to represent, a county, bearing the name of such a tory, he therefore moved to call it. Shenandoah, after the name of the beautiful stream which passed through it, which was accordingly adopted. Shenandoah is bounded N. and N. E. by Frederick,—E. and S. E. by Page,—S. and S. W. by Rockingham,—W. and N. W. by Hardy. Its average lat is about 38° 50′ N. and long. 1° 30′ W. of W. C.,—its greatest length from S. W. to N. E. is 32 miles,—average width 15,—and area 384 sq. ms. This is a fertile and populous county, situated in the valley. The whole county is traversed by the North Fork of Shenandoah river, lying between the Massanutten and North mountain. The North and South branches of the Shenandoah river pass through the entire length of the county and Page, and unite immediately below its north-eastern line, and form the Shenandoah river. They admit of a descending navigation when the waters are a little swollen,—its creeks are Cedar creek, Passage creek, Stoney creek, Mill creek and Smith's creek. It is divided into four valleys, two of which are long and two small,—by the Three Topped or Massanutten mountain and the Little North mountain. The larger valleys are watered by the North and South Shenandoah rivers, the smaller vallies by Cedar and Passage creeks. The land in the vallies is principally limestone, and is well adapted to the cultivation of wheat, rye, Indian corn and oats, and is divided into small farms. Its staple articles are flour, bacon, beef, butter and iron. There are within it 34 manufacturing flour mills, 2 furnaces and 4 forges, for the manufacturing of pig metal into bar iron, and another furnace and forge are now being erected. Its mineral resources have been but partially explored. Iron ore of the best quality abounds, copper, lead, cobalt and copperas have been found, but not in sufficient quantities to justify working them. There are several chalybeate and sulphur springs which are places of resort in the warm season. The Valley of the Gooney is situated in the eastern part of the county, immediately at the western base of the Blue Ridge. It is bounded on the S. by the Hog-back mountain, which is one of the highest summits of the Blue Ridge, on the E. by the Blue Ridge; on the N. and W. by Dickey's hill and the Buck mountain, both of which, are spurs of the Blue Ridge. It is about 7 miles in length and 4 in breadth. The face of this section of country, is hilly and rugged, but the soil is sufficiently productive, and yields, when well cultivated, abundant crops of corn, wheat, rye, &amp;c. Clover and timothy thrive remarkably well on this soil, as plaster acts with an astonishing effect. There is a great proportion of excellent meadow land, there being scarcely a field that has not one or more streams of water passing through it. Almost every farmer has a spring of excellent mountain water near his door, and breathing a pure mountain atmosphere; the inhabitants are extremely healthy and robust, having uniformly escaped those periodical diseases which have been so fatal in other sections of Virginia. The principal stream is the Gooney, which is a creek of the largest class. It rises near the top of the Hog back, and running a N. W. course about 12 miles, empties into the South River about 5 miles, above the town of Front Royal. It affords some fine situations for water-works, and moves several merchant mills and saw mills. The mountains, with which it is surrounded, afford an inexhaustible supply of excellent timber. There is a woollen factory, 1 common school, 2 churches (Methodist and Baptist) and several extensive distilleries of grain,—whiskey, plank and flour being the chief articles of export. This valley is thickly settled by a hardy, honest and industrious people. From the top of the Blue Ridge, at Dade's gap, nearly opposite the town of Washington, in the county of Rappahannock, there is a magnificent view of the eastern part of the county of Shenandoah (now Page) and of the county of Rappahannock. Near this place there is a remarkable rock called the Raven's Den, it having been occupied as the aerie of that wild bird from time immemorial. It is entirely inaccessible to man. Near Cheek's gap, Lann's run, a bold mountain current, a branch of the Gooney, forms a most beautiful cascade, the water falling 60 or 70 feet perpendicular. There is another beautiful cascade near Milford, formed by the stream which divides the counties of Shenandoah and Page; the waters of which fall about 100 feet at one perpendicular pitch. The Fort Mountain. This name has been given to a range of mountains in the county of Shenandoah, which are, in elevation, about equal to the Blue Ridge. This range commences nearly opposite to the town of Newmarket, at which place it is called the Massanutten mountain, and extends in a direction nearly from S. W. to N. E. or in a line coinciding with the meanderings of the North branch of the Shenandoah river. Unlike the Blue Ridge, which is extremely fertile, and the greater part of which is susceptible of successful and profitable cultivation, this mountain is precipitous and rugged in the extreme, and is covered, for the most part, with a thick growth of oak, pine, hickory, chesnut, &amp;c. Its forests afford a shelter for a great number of deer, bears, turkies and other game, with which the mountain abounds. Nearly opposite the town of Luray in the county of Page, its eastern base is washed by the South, and its western base by the North branch of the Shenandoah river. At this place the mountain forks, and instead of one, there are two distinct mountains, stretching in the same direction, and running parallel to each other. These mountains form what is termed the Fort. They have received the name "Fort Mountains," from the peculiar form of the valley which they enclose, which, with the addition of some slight military fortifications might be rendered impregnable. The only road which crosses this mountain is the one which leads from Luray to Woodstock, which is at the upper end of the Fort, and which at the expense of much labor is kept passable for light loaded carriages. The valley which is enclosed by these mountains, is about 25 miles in length and about 3 in mean breadth. It is tolerably fruitful in grass, corn, rye, buck-wheat, potatoes, turnips, &amp;c. At the upper end of the Fort, rises Passage creek, a large and very rapid mountain current, which works several fine merchant mills. Its whole length is about 30 miles. The Fort is supposed to be extremely rich in mineral ores, of which iron and copper are among its discovered mineral productions. There are in the Fort, several common schools, 2 Meeting-houses, 3 grist mills, 3 oil mills, a powder factory, several smith shops and a sufficient number of mechanics. The population is about 700 souls. In making an excavation for a well, a few weeks since, (Jan. 1834,) some fine specimens of petrifaction were discovered at a considerable distance below the present surface of the earth. These petrifactions consist of toads, snakes, &amp;c. in a state of entire preservation. The East and West Fort mountains terminate abruptly nearly opposite the town of Strasburg. The points opposite this place are the highest parts of the mountain, being about 1200 feet above the level of the river. The entrance or mouth of the Fort forms one of the most awful defiles in America. The space between the mountains is barely wide enough for a narrow road, which runs on the bank and sometimes in the bed of the large and rapid creek which rushes impetuously over the rugged surface of its channel. On each side of the road the mountain rises so perpendicularly as to be entirely inaccessible. The East Fort mountain especially exhibits the most magnificent scenery, and rock piled on rock, from base to top, without a shrub to break the view, and bids defiance to the approaches of man. Here, in summer, may be seen great numbers of vultures basking in the sun, or with expanded wings inhaling the cooling breeze. In the caverns which are in this cliff, it is said these vultures remain in a torpid state during the winter. There are some of the finest landscape views from this mountain which can be imagined. At a point nearly opposite Woodstock, from the East Fort mountain, the South river presents the appearance of three distinct streams of water, crossing the valley from the western base of the Blue Ridge, to the foot of the Fort mountain. If an observer, station himself on the top of the East mountain, at the N. end, and look "down east" the beautiful valley of the South river is presented full to his view. The thrifty village of Front Royal with the adjacent country interspersed with elegant country villas, fertile farms and thick forests alternately meet the eye. If he look a little higher his horizon is bounded by the indented top of the Blue Ridge, which stretches N. and S. as far as the vision can extend; its surface from base to summit is beautifully diversified with cultivated farms and sloping woodlands. If he look W. into the profound abyss below him, he recoils with horror from the awful sight. If he station himself on the N. end of the West mountain, he has a full view of the valley of the North river. Strasburg, which is 4 miles distant, appears almost under his feet. At a distance of 7 miles, he sees Middletown, 5 miles further he sees Newtown, and at a distance of 20 miles he sees the large and populous town of Winchester,—its stately dwellings and towering steeples glittering in the sun. A great part of the county of Frederick is seen in full perspective. But one of the finest landscapes in Virginia, and perhaps in the world, is seen from a point on the West Fort mountain nearly opposite Woodstock. Here, if the observer look towards "the far east," the "blue brow" of the North mountain, which stretches N. and S. further than the eye can view, appears to peep into the clouds and to tower above them, many of which actually sail below its summit. The fertile valley which lies between the North mountain and Woodstock, is seen so distinctly, that a person who is acquainted with the country, may designate most of the farms which are seen from this point, the view from which, extends over a country about 15 miles in extent. The town of Woodstock, which is about 5 miles distant, is seen so plainly, that the observer may count almost every house in that beautiful village. Between Woodstock and the mountain (Fort) lies the rich valley which is watered by the North branch of the Shenandoah. The river in its mean, derings approaches very near the mountain, and then retreats a considerable distance towards Woodstock, where after making a turn it suddenly returns to the mountain without the bend at either place being perceived. Thus it alternately approaches the mountain and recedes from it, until it presents the appearance of seven distinct livers running parallel to each other. The river at this place, is about 150 feet in width, and forms a beautiful sheet of water which sparkles in the sun like a stream of silver. The space which is enclosed by each bend of the river is, apparently about large enough for a beautiful farm, and the bottoms being abundantly fertile, the whole scene presents one of the most picturesque landscapes in the world. Shenandoah is an Indian name, signifying clear water, and like most of the Indian names is very appropriate, these rivers being remarkable for their transparent waters. In 1831 part of this county which lies between the Blue Ridge and the Massachutten mountain was taken off, and with a small part of Rockingham county, formed into a new county called Page. When the county was first settled, about the year 1735, its population was composed principally of Irish and Scotch, but few of their descendants are now found within it, as the county became more settled, they were supplanted by Germans from Pennsylvania,—and the greater part of its population, now consists of their descendants. They are a plain, frugal and industrious people. A few years since the German language was very much spoken and taught in the schools, but it is now rapidly giving place to the English, which is now universally taught in all the schools. Population in 1820, 18,926—in 1830, 19,750. By the separation of Page the population is reduced to 14,000. This county belongs to the 14th judicial circuit and 7th district. Tax paid in 1833, $3,506 09—in 1834, on lots. $253 33—land, $2,479 68—984 slaves, $246 00—5,575 horses, $334 50—22 studs, $128 00—23 coaches, $53 00—27 carryalls, $27 00 —16 gigs, $12 65. Total $3,534 16. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $1,512 16—in 1833, $827 29. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Allen's Cave. In the county of Shenandoah, a short distance from the town of Front Royal, is Allen's Cave, which may with propriety, be styled a great natural curiosity. It is situated on the right bank of the Shenandoah, about a quarter of a mile from the river, in the side of a hill of considerable elevation. The face of the country in its vicinity, is romantic in the extreme, being a thick forest of oak, pine and cedar, interspersed with ledges and cliffs of limestone. The entrance into this cavern is by a gradual descent of about 45°. The mouth is about 5 feet in width and 15 in height. After proceeding about 60 feet, the explorer reaches what may be termed the vestibule of this grand work of nature, after which the floor becomes comparatively level. Upon looking back, towards the entrance, the beholder is struck with the singular beauty and regularity of the magnificent arch, which is composed of solid lime. The cavity here is about 10 feet in width and 30 in height. Proceeding some distance, it becomes very narrow and so low, that it is necessary to stoop much in order to advance. Upon emerging from this narrow defile, the admirer of the works of nature, is presented with one of the most magnificent scenes which the fancy can imagine. He finds himself ushered into a vast room, the extent of which, from end to end, is more than 150 feet, and of very considerable width. The height of the roof or ceiling, varies from 10 to 50 or 60 feet, forming some of the finest arches that the eye ever beheld. The ceiling and walls of this apartment, which is called Sarah's saloon, are 57 covered with sparry incrustations which have been formed by the drippings of the water from the roof. In some places, they have the appearance of pendant icicles; in other places they bear a strong resemblance to the folds of drapery, and appear to hang in festoons which art can neither rival or imitate. In some places the sparry stalactites resemble the most beautiful sculpture, at one point presenting the image of a magnificent pillar or colossal statue, at another the curved and wavy appearance of a cataract in miniature. If a piece of the spar be thrown into a crucible or even into a hot coal fire, it fuses, and becomes as transparent as glass. It is, however, to be regretted, that the most beautiful specimens of the spar have been abstracted by the numerous visiters; and that, the walls and roof of Sarah's saloon, which were once of the most glittering transparency, have been blackened by the smoke of the pine torches, which have been used in exploring it. Upon leaving the saloon, it becomes necessary to ascend about 12 or 15 feet perpendicular, which is done by means of a ladder, at the top of which is a small room which is evidently the highest and yet the closest apartment in the cave, as the candles burn less freely here, than in any other part of the cavern. On speaking, or striking with the hand against the wall the sound is increased to an astonishing loudness. At the farther extremity of this upper apartment is a reservoir of water of a circular shape, about 5 feet in diameter and 4 in depth, called the Fairy's bath, and within a few feet of the bath, is a small basin called the Fairy's wash-bowl,—both formed in the solid rock and full of water of the most limpid clearness. After leaving this place, the passage forks. That passage which leads straight forward, passes through some small rooms and narrow defiles, until it reaches a large apartment; at the extremity of the cavern. This chamber which is called the Sylph's dressing-room, is about the size of the saloon, with a lofty ceiling of sparry concretions,—once clear as crystal— now rendered dingy by the smoke. It has several outlets, too small to admit the body of a man; but it is probable that if they were enlarged, they might lead to other rooms in this subterraneous abode, which it is possible and even probable, may extend to the river. Near the Fairy's bath, is a narrow passage, which turns to the right, called the labyrinth. After various mazes and intricate windings under low arches, so contracted in breadth as to admit only one person abreast, the winding ceases, and the explorer finds himself in a straight passage, about 40 feet in length, 3 in breadth, and 7 in height, and which, without doubt, forms one of the most beautiful, regular and symmetrical arches in the world. Issuing from this passage the explorer finds himself in the ball-room, which is decidedly the best room in the cave. The length is 160 or 170 feet, and the breadth at least 30 feet. Here, too, as in the other rooms, the hands of vandal visiters, have torn off the beautiful spar from the wall, thus having robbed the cave of its glittering ornaments, and deprived posterity in a measure, of one of the most magnificent scenes that ever met the eye of man. The floor is of soft clay and remarkably level and smooth. Here, before the invention of dandies, tights, corsets, balloon sleeves, prunella slippers, large combs and leghorn flats, the beaux and belles of by gone days met, and held social parties, and while "mingling in the giddy mazes of the sprightly dance," the foot and hand kept time with the clarionet and violin, and the merry song, the wild music, the free jest, the witty retort and the hearty laugh, all telling of enjoyment, reached the remotest depths of this spacious grotto,—while pleased echo caught the sound, and reverberating from grotto to grotto, told the deities of the place, of the mirth and innocent amusement which were to be found in the ball-room of Allen's cave. Even in these, our degenerate days, the cave is still visited by hundreds of persons who generally speak in terms of the highest praise of the wonders which they have seen in this subterranean world. The extent of this cavern has never been ascertained—but it is supposed to be about 1200 feet. Cedar Creek, P. O. 162 miles from R. and 83 from W. Fortsmouth, P. O. 147 ms. from R. and 83 W. of W. This village is pleasantly situated in a narrow valley, and in the fork of the North and South branches of the Shenandoah river, surrounded on the south and west by the Fort mountain. It contains several dwelling houses, 1 manufacturing flour mill, 1 saw mill, 1 distillery, and various mechanics. Population 30. There are in the immediate vicinity two houses of public worship, the one Baptist, and the other free for all denominations. It is distant 25 ms. from Winchester and 18 from Woodstock. Fortsmouth derives its name from Powell's Fort, at the `mouth' of which it is located, and which is a great natural curiosity,—the valley being formed by the Massariutten mountain, springing up on the west side of the Shenandoah river, commencing between New Market and Staunton, running south west and north east until it reaches a short distant below New Market;—it then breaks off into two mountains, the one running down the North and the other down the South branch of the Shenandoah river. These two mountains form Powell's Fort, which receives its name from an individual who it is said was the first settler within the fort. This Fort as it is called, is thirty miles in length, with a fine stream running entirely thro' it called Passage creek, on which are situated many springs of pure water at various distances. Mount Hope, P. O. 144 ms. from R. and 80 S. W. by W. of W. Mount Jackson, P. O. 157 ms. from R. and 113 W. of W. It contains 8 dwelling houses, 1 Presbyterian house of public worship, 1 common school, 1 mercantile store, 1 tavern, 1 tanyard, 1 smith shop, and 1 boot factory. The country around is a little broken, the soil gray and sandy, of ordinary quality, producing Indian corn, wheat and oats tolerably well. Strasburg, P. O. 153 ms. from R. and 89 W. of W., situated in the northern part of the county, on the North branch of the Shenandoah river, immediately on the main road leading from Woodstock to Winchester, 12 ms. N. of the former and 18 S. of the latter. This is a healthy and thriving village, containing 78 dwelling houses, 3 houses of public worship. (1 Presbyterian, 1 Lutheran, and 1 free for all denominations,) 3 schools, including an academy, (a handsome building with a valuable lot of land attached, on which has been erected out of the income an excellent house as a residence for the principal.) There are also 3 mercantile stores, 1 apothecary shop, 2 taverns, 1 stone and 1 earthen ware manufactory, 4 tanyards, 5 cabinet makers, 1 turner, 4 blacksmith shops, 1 plasterer, 3 bricklayers, 2 gun smiths, 5 tailors, 6 boot and shoe factories, and 4 cooper shops. Population 470 persons; of whom 6 are regular physicians. The inhabitants are principally Germans, of industrious and economical habits. New Market, P. V., delightfully situated in the great valley of Virginia, between the Massanutten and North mountains, 120 ms. W. by S. of W. and 150 ms. N. W. of R., in lat 38° 36′ 30″ N. and long 1° 37′ W. from W. It is a central point between the towns of Winchester and Staunton, being 50 miles distant from either place. The main road leading from the counties of Pendleton and Hardy, eastward across Thornton's Gap in the direction of Fredericksburg, intersects the great valley road at this place. The town was founded about the year 1784. It is at this time three-fourths of a mile in length, containing above one hundred dwelling houses, with a population of 700 persons. The streets are remarkably level, straight and well laid out, bearing south 25 west, a direction nearly parallel with the Massanutten mountain and two miles distant from its base. There are 3 houses of public worship, viz 1 Lutheran, 1 Baptist, and 1 Methodist, 1 large and commodious brick academy, in which is taught all the branches of liberal and polite education, 1 book and job printing office, 5 stores, 3 taverns, 1 resident attorney, and 4 regular physicians— There is perhaps no town in the state of the same size, where the mechanical pursuits are carried on to a greater extent than in this. There are here in active and extensive operation—1 manufactory of threshing machines, &amp;c., 2 wheelwrights, 4 cabinet makers and house-joiners, 4 tanneries, 2 saddle and harness making establishments, 2 chair factories, 4 boot and shoe manufactories, 3 hat factories, 1 silversmith and jeweller, 1 coppersmith and tin plate worker, 2 gunsmiths, 2 blacksmiths, 1 locksmith, 1 sleymaker, 1 saddle tree maker, 1 diaper weaver, and 2 potteries, at one of which stone ware of a superior quality is manufactured. There are also in the vicinity 2 forges for the manufactory of pig metal into bar iron, both of which are at this time in active operation. The country around abounds in iron ore of the best quality. The North fork of the Shenandoah river runs within a mile of the town on the western side; and is navigable at high water for boats carrying one hundred barrels of flour to the Plain Mills 2½ miles above the town but the navigation is somewhat hazardous, as the river is passable for boats of this burden only during a freshet. The Massanutten mountain on the east of the town presents a beautiful and unbroken view to the eye of an observer, free from any spurs, or secondary mountains, to obstruct his sight, for many miles in extent, presenting upon the whole a spectacle highly grand and picturesque. There is a caseade on this mountain about, 3½ miles from the town, which as it appears not to be embraced in any written account of the State deserves to be noticed.— It presents the curious spectacle of a beautiful sheet of water falling from the height of fifty feet perpendicular, The large table rock over which the water falls is so perfectly level and smooth, that the water falls in an entire and unbroken sheet of several yards in width, which it retains until it strikes the bottom sufficiently far from the perpendicular for a person to pass conveniently between that and the sheet of water, without danger of getting wet. This falling sheet of water is so perfectly transparent, that it may be seen for several hundred yards, glistening thro' the thick surrounding woods, presenting a beautiful spectacle. Among the rocks of this country are the blue and grey limestone, slates, sand-stone and burr-stone.— The adjacent country is famed for its fertility, and is well adapted to the culture of wheat, rye, Indian corn, and grass. No country can boast more of its healthy situation than this; in short nothing seems to be wanting to render it among the most desirable sections of country in the State, but a facility of access to market, and whenever that is given, it may be confidently predicted, that no part of the United States will present greater rewards to enteprise and industry. Stony Ghedk, or Shryock, P. O. 162 ms. from R. and 105 S. W. of W., situated on Stony creek, near the North Fork of Shenandoah. The creek empties into the river one mile E. of this place. It is distant 8 ms. S. S. W. of Woodstock, and 35 in a similar direction from Winchester. This village contains 17 dwelling houses, 2 mercantile stores, 1 house of public entertainment, 1 rifle manufactory, and 1 blacksmith shop. Population 130 persons; of whom 1 is a physician. The land is fertile, producing well all the ordinary staples, and the county is thickly settled. Stoney creek is a bold stream, affording some excellent sites for manufactories. There are located on it, and within 2 miles of the village, at various distances, a considerable number of dwelling houses, 2 extensive manufacturing flour mills, 2 grist mills, 7 saw mills, 1 well established fulling mill, and 2 wool carding machines, 1 still-house, 1 tannery, and 1 forge in active operation, manufacturing pig metal into bar iron, and 1 furnace called Columbia, with about 200 persons dependant on it for support. WOODSTOCK, P. V. and seat of justice, 156 ms. from R. and 100 S. W. of W. in lat. 38° 51′ N. and long. 1° 34′ W. of W. C., situated on the main valley road 32 ms. S. S. W. of Winchester and about 1 mile W. of the North Fork of the Shenandoah river. It contains besides the usual county buildings, 118 dwelling houses, 3 houses of public worship, (1 Lutheran, 1 Methodist and 1 German Reformed,) 1 Masonic Hall, 1 handsome brick academy, 3 other schools, and 2 sabbath schools, 1 printing office from which a weekly paper is issued, 5 mercantile stores, 2 taverns, 3 tan yards, 4 saddlers, 2 hatters, 5 boot and shoe factories, 5 house joiners and carpenters, 3 wheelwrights and chair makers, 4 tailors, 2 smith shops, 1 earthen and 1 stone ware manufactory, 1 watch maker and silver smith, 1 wagon maker, 1 tin plate worker, 2 saddletree makers, 2 saddle-tree platers, 2 bricklayers and masons, and 2 plasterers. Population 950 persons; of whom 3 are resident attorneys, and 4 are ministers and 3 regular physicians. County Courts are held on the Monday before the 2d Tuesday in every month;—Quorterly in March, May, August and November. Judge Smith holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 9th of April and September. SMYTH. Smyth was created by act of Assembly in 1831, and formed from a portion of Washington and Wythe. It is bounded W. by Clinch-mountain separating it from Russell,—N. W. and N. by the same mountain, separating it from Tazewell,—N. E. and E. by Wythe,—and by the Iron mountain separating it from Grayson S. E. and S. It is located on the head waters of Holston river. The eastern line dividing Smyth and Wythe crosses within fifty yards of the head spring. The county is divided into three valleys,—the North, South and Middle Forks of the Holston running parallel with the different valleys. The North Fork rises between Clinch and Walker's mountains pursues a northerly course some distance, and then winds to the west. The mountains are lofty,—the bottom lands are rich and productive. On this fork is found gypsum of the best quality, and sufficient in quantity to supply the whole western country. In that neighborhood is situated the salt works belonging to Gen'l Preston. These works, and King's in Washington county, are denominated Saltville,—they are within 40 feet of each other. The place has risen up in consequence of the salt works. The county line separating Smyth and Washington counties runs between them. (For further particulars see Saltville in this county.) An experiment lately made on the water of Preston's works was attended with complete success,—twenty bushels full produced a deposite of five bushels of salt, which weighed one hundred and fifty-one pounds, shewing it to be in proportion of one-fourth to the water which contains it. It is supposed that no other water approaches this strength, and it is quite free from the slightest quantity of bittern or other foreign matter. From this supply five hundred bushels of salt may be manufactured in twenty-four hours. On the middle fork of the Holston are situated the Chilhowee Sulphur Springs, within one mile of the great road. They stand as high for the medicinal qualities of their waters as any spring in Virginia. There are also in the same vicinity several chalybeate springs. The productions are wheat, rye, Indian corn, buckwheat, Irish potatoes, hemp, flax, and every species of the vine; being one of the best grape counties in Virginia. This county is well timbered with the best of white and black oak, buckeye, poplar, hickory, black walnut, lynn, pine, sassafras, dog wood, birch, beech, and the spice wood tree. Along the branches are elder of different qualities, spruce pine, and the hemlock tree. It also abounds with the maple or sugar tree. This tree is more valuable than all others; if it is notched in the month of March, and bored with a small auger or gimblet some distance below the notch and a tube placed in, one tree will afford in a season from 30 to 60 gallons of sweet water, which when boiled will always produce from 3 to 4 pounds of good sugar, besides the molasses, which is superior to any other. The tops of these trees are large, tapering something like a sugar loaf, the bark is rough and body straight, some of them are of a light color, others black. The latter always produce the sweetest water. Some of these maple trees grow to an enormous size. The wood is precious, and when cut and corded, one tree will make from 6 to 7 cords. The next in size is the yellow poplar, which exceeds in growth any timber in the United States. It is no uncommon thing to find this timber from 3 to 4 feet and upwards in diameter, and the trunks 44 feet in height before a limb shoots. The white oak and other timber is in proportion. There are in this county one cotton manufactory, (at the court house,) 3 iron works, 14 tan yards, 16 grist mills, 14 houses of public worship, (5 Methodist, 2 Presbyterian, 3 Baptists, 3 free for all denominations, and 1 Lutheran,) and 8 taverns or houses of public entertainment. The elevation of Davis's town, situated 2 miles from the east line of the county, and on Pleasant Hill, is 200 feet above James River at Lynchburg. Population not taken at the last census, the county having been since created, but supposed to be between 6 and 7000, of which there are 100 free persons of color, and 1400 slaves. It belongs to the fourteenth judicial circuit and eight district. Tax paid in 1833, $941 57—in 1834 on land $572 04—470 slaves, $117 50—2675 horses, $160 50—20 studs, $123 50 —5 coaches, $10 00—5 carryalls, $5 00—1 gig, 50 cts. Total, $989 04. No report of school commissioners for 1832. Expended in educating poor children in 1833, $220 26. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. MARION P. V. and county seat, was located two years since. The improvements have rapidly progressed. A handsome court house, clerk's office, and jail, have been erected, 10 or 12 neat dwelling houses have been completed and several others are in progress of erection, 2 mercantile stores have been established, and 2 others are about going into operation. One cotton manufactory on a small scale, and various mechanical pursuits are carried on; the principal of which are bricklaying, stone masonry, house carpentry, tailoring, saddlery, and blacksmithing. Population about 100 persons, of whom 3 are resident attorneys, and 2 regular physicians. County Courts are held on the Thursday after the third Monday in every month, Quarterly in February, May, July and October. Judge Estill holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the Monday after the fourth Monday in April and September. Pleasant Hill, P. O. 269 ms. from R. and 344 S. W. by W. of W. Saltville, P. O. This settlement derives its name from the justly celebrated Saltworks of Preston and King. Preston's well being located in Smyth, and King's in Washington county. They are not more than forty feet apart, the line dividing the two counties running between the wells. The following topographical, geological and general remarks respecting them, and the surrounding country, are taken from an article published in the Abingdon Republican. "The place called Saltville, is situated in a narrow plain of about 700 acres of land, between the Rich Valley and the North Fork of the Holston, having its greatest length from the northeast to the southwest, bounded on the eastern side by conical peaks and ridges which are appendages of Walker's mountain and on the western side by conical peaks and highland intervening between it and the North fork of the Holston river, which washes their bases for many miles. This branch of the Holston is declared a public highway, but has many obstructions, which it is believed could be removed by expendture of $6 000, so as to be suitable for batteaux and flat boats, from Saltville, to its mouth at Kingsport, a distance of 65 miles by water. "The present point of manufacturing salt is on the bank of the river, to which for convenience of timber and fuel the water is conveyed, about two miles, in a northwardly course, in wooden tubes. On the opposite bank of the river lies Little mountain, an appendage of Clinch mountain, which is parallel and continuous with that mountain for hundreds of miles, and between which, lies a narrow stoney valley, commonly called the Poor Valley. The numerous streams having their source in the Clinch mountain, pass through the breaks of Little mountain into the North Fork, along its course. To the northwest of Clinch mountain, and parallel with it, lie Copper Ridge. Powel's mountain, Cumberland mountains, and the Log mountains, having narrow valleys; and the rivers Clinch, Powel's and Cumberland, and their waters, interspersing, beautifying and enriching, these inviting, but for the present, neglected regions. Beyond Log mountains and the adjacent ridges in Kentucky, lie streams emptying into the Ohio; on one of which is the Goose Creek Salt Manufactory, about 150 miles from Saltville. "Viewing the country from Saltville, towards the south of Walker's mountain, fine valleys and fertile ridges are passed before you reach the middle and south fork of Holston river, and thence towards the southwest; passing many tributaries, you cross the Watauga, French Broad, Nolachucky, and the hundred streams rising in this mountain district, and winding their way westward, to form the broad and beautiful. Tennessee river; whilst those running from the same quarter eastwardly, compose the bold and restless waters of the Great Kanawha,—all adding utility and beauty; either to the valleys bordering on the large rivers, or the irregular but level depressions called coves, hemmed in all around except a single passway; which sometimes exhibits a cataract in its little stream. "East of the New River waters, the Alleghany mountain directs the streams to the Atlantic, and at some points you might stand with one foot in the waters of the Atlantic, the other in those which wend their weary way to the hot Mexican gulph, and the great mart for the effective industry of the millions of people which the valley of the Mississippi, is inviting from other extremes to those parts. Standing at such a point, your admiration would be excited, that amidst such a boundless view of masses beyond masses, of high parallel and irregular mountains, the rivers should all find their way to their destinations, without falls or other impediments to navigation, which the skill and energies of man, at trifling expense, may not remove, thus adding vigor to the giant heart, the Estuary of our thousand rivers, which is to receive, commercially cherish and return, as it were the vitalized fluids to all the extremities. With amazement, still heightened, would you behold from the great White Top, (the neutral ground of North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee,) the Spinal Alleghany and the Blue Ridge, with its granite cliffs and basaltic rocks, running diagonally athwart each other, and as if in the formative day of their creation, each of these huge columns of uplifted matter had been shot forward from the north and northeast; and neither having the advantage of force over the other, a contest terrible commenced, in which the champions both discomfitted, glanced each taking its own path southwardly, leaving their cast away remnants piled fearfully "Ossa upon Pelion, and Pelion upon Ossa," rolling confusedly into thousands of rude shapes. But in this field of old warring elements are every where, as you would also perceive, evidences presented, that the principle of order has been passing and nestling, has changed and given new capacities, striking the waste "rocks with the rod," millions of springs of purest water gushed forth; the uptorn hills became verdant, and all the glories of redundant vegetation do more than honor to the silent mountains; thousands of choicest animals browse and revel on the spontaneous herbage; and man invited last, has made his home in these high places, and being far removed from the great commercial haunts of luxury and vice, hope may long rest in security, that here at least, some share—a large share of health, happiness, independence and freedom will be enjoyed? Why do the inhabitants of these regions, so bounteously fitted for their use, desert them for Eldorado's in the great and laboring and slave holding and money grasping west? Too many have quit, have left their mountains,—but the day of return is commencing in our favor, it was not so with those who listened to the song of William Tell; for deeds of arms when necessity calls; or for hearth-talks `in piping times of peace,' there is no `place like a home in the mountains and in the valleys.' You have no doubt seen the surprise of strangers on the highway, when reaching in some parts of this country (as Burk's garden with its ten thousand elevated level acres) the first view of valleys below, in foggy mornings; whilst on the mountain the sun is brilliantly beaming, the stranger's eye will be arrested with what he supposes is a broad and lengthened lake below. The deception is perfect, the very waves are seen rolling and tempest tossed, nor will the appearance of islands and of trees breaking through the mist as it evaporates, nor the sounds of ploughmen, the screaking of iron works, or the monotonous beat of the forge hammer, issuing from the gulph below (till then unheard of,) dispel the optical illusion, —the rolling mist must be dispersed before he can believe the deception. "Let the James River improvements have an arm extended towards the Tennessee, and the latter be improved with that spirit which has characterized Tennessee for the last twelve months; or let a Macadam road be constructed through the natural depression of all the mountains, from the Atlantic to the Mississippi, and it requires only the slightest knowledge of things, to be convinced, that in internal resources no part of the union can vie with this, especially in minerals. Preston's salt-works are in Smyth county, and King's in Washington, and the same counties abound in immense banks of iron ore. In the adjoining county of Carter, are above twenty iron making establishments now in operation, some of which are small bloomeries, and in some places solid masses of ore, containing seventy-five per cent of metal, are exposed thirty or forty feet high, like cliffs of rock. The countres of Green, Washington, Sullivan, Campbell, Claiborne, Anderson, Knox, Rhea, Hamilton in Tennessee, Harlan, Ky., Ash, Buncomb, Rutherford and other counties of North Carolina, and Monroe, Giles, Montgomery, Floyd, Grayson, Preston, Wythe and other counties in Virginia abound in exhaustless quantities of iron, and many of those counties have quarries of various sorts of stone coal and innumerable seats for water power. "In Grayson and Wythe are large bodies of rich copper ore, not yet fully tested, and in the latter county, lead ore of the best quality, worked by Col James White and Alexander Pierce,—what amount of lead could be made is unknown, as the ore bank seems inexhaustible, and coal in abundance, as near as Graham's forge and iron furnace. The capacity of the soil to produce different sorts of timber after the first is cut off is very remarkable in this country—those acquainted with the soil and first growth of timber can foretell what will be the second and third growth on land once cultivated or on new land. "Preston's Saltville land contains a description of millstones, easily quarried, which are equal to the best French burr stones for flour mills; and at various points in the vicinity, and in Russell county are quarries of various marbles. In the valleys, buried in the soil, are innumerable rounded sandstone rocks, some of which are flinty, others of marly ingredients, and many such loose stones occupy the shoaly beds of the streams, but the channels of all streams are chiefly bedded by limestone, mica, sandstone, and slaty formations, whose lamella or divisions are seldom horizontal, until you arrive at the level of the great western rivers. You may here find ledges of rocks extending hundreds of miles 58 in a perpendicular posture, occasionally broken where ridges transverse each other; but in the general these ledges are either massive and of waving configuration and striated irregularly, or are inclined at angles whose medium may be 45 degrees of the horizon, and it would seem, that they had perpetually sought to reach that angle, notwithstanding such prominent failures so to do. The declining direction is continuous through the body of the hills and ridges generally, and the upper plane is facing the south, as far as parallelism with the general course of the ridges will permit; and in consequence of this southern exposure of the planes of the rocks in all the mountains west of the Alleghany to the verge of those mountains east of the Mississippi, chemical nature has not the same variety of surface to work upon, that it has where the upward direction of the rocks expose their edges, on the northwardly side of the ridges, and as might be expected, the southern faces are comparatively barren, whilst the opposite side is rich and productive, and such differences are observable even on the south side, where deep ravines expose the broken ends of rocks one side, and their rather plane surface on the other. This conformation holds immense quantities of water and pours it forth even on the pinnacles of the highest hills, decomposing the ground by winter freezes and summer drought, and adding fertility even to the rocks, the timber growing to enormous sizes, by passing its roots into the interstices of rocks. The region of North Carolina and Tennessee, in which gold is found, about 60 to 100 miles from Saltville, borders on the primitive granite and basaltic walls that rise under the Blue Ridge, and are rarely exposed on its western face; and in Virginia, the copper mines of Grayson and Wythe are not remote from similar constructions. The lead, iron and salt minerals are found in, or bedded upon limestone, slate and other rocks of the transition kind, while stone coal and gypsum and sandstone are evidently all of a much later formaton, as they do not run under, but stop short, on reaching masses of primitive and transition rocks. The great upper body of the Clinch and Cumberland mountains, and their appending chains are chiefiy formed of strata and irregular masses of sandstone, which is undergoing great changes, decomposing in some parts and increasing and hardening in others; much of the limestone composing the basis of these mountains is a very coarse and impure carbonate. The multitude of sulphur and chalybeate, hot and cold springs, and their various medicinal qualities in Bath, Monroe, Buncomb and other places that deserve to have celebrity for their waters, exhibit astonishing chemical changes yet going on far below the earth's surface. After passing westwardly, beyond the verge of these broken ranges, you perceive great uniformity and order in the conformations of rocks and soils. The rivers and creeks are based with good limestone, lammellated horizontally, and having fissures at unequal distances, extending perpendicularly to great depths. Commencing at the surface, there will be found rich, loamy soils, and clays, often mixed with gravel or sandstone to the depth of six or ten feet, then limestone as described, next a white coarse limestone four to eight feet, in one, two, or three strata, next limestone of thicker layers, sometimes fifty feet; then a layer of gray, blue, or black flint, three to six feet; next blue brittled limestone all fissured and lammellar, then slate of a dark brittle kind, horizontal and of considerable depth, containing brilliant yellow, oval lumps of sulphur and iron, below which are layers of hard, flinty, dark rocks, with occasional layers of slate. At places like these, and other formations of a standard kind, those who would undertake to classify rocks into different ages, might form plausible theories which would `vanish into thin air' when tested by the mixed up productions of this mountainous country. Here rude shapes of simple organization are sometimes seen in the transition, or what little agrees with the secondary limestone of the west. "Saltville was the property of General William Campbell, the hero of Kings' mountain, and after his decease his only child Sarah, married General Francis Preston, who rented the well and salt marsh to Wm. King, an enterprising young Irishman, who conducted the business profitably, returned to Ireland for his father and brothers and sisters, and in a few years in partnership with the late Josiah Nichol of Nashville, and other worthy mercantile partners, on whom fortune has always smiled, had amassed very handsome profits. Wm. King apprised General Preston and lady, that a tract of land adjoining theirs was for sale, and advised them to purchase, as salt-water could be procured upon it, and upon their declining, he parchased it for about $2,000. King and Nichol then dug a twelve foot square well, cribbing it with timber, and paying the Rev. Mr. Colley about $2,000 for its expences, until the opening was about two hundred feet in depth. King had marked out the spot and declared he would go on until water was found, and Nichol withdrawing from the concern, on digging twelve feet deeper, the well filled to within forty feet of the surface of the earth with salt water, of which thirty-two gallons would make, on drying the salt, a measured bushel of 50 lbs. weight. This was on the 6th of April, 1797, and the quantity of water being inexhaustible, by any use made of it, salt was reduced from $5 to $1 50 cts. per bushel; and a more liberal rent was given General Preston of $9,000 per annum for his well, which then ceased to be worked; and the parties continued on the most friendly terms towards each others' welfare. William King having in view to encourage every branch of industry, and calculating that thereby immense wealth would flow to himself enlarged his mercantile pursuits dealt with great liberality, and becoming very popular, his wealth so increased, that at his death, the 13th October, 1808, his personal estate was estimated at above one million dollars. "Preston's and King's works were then conducted by his widow, now Mrs. F. Smith, James King and Wm. Trigg, as devisees of a life estate; and since by Col. Jas White; at present by Wm. King &amp; Co; Mr. King being the only son living of James King and devisee of the estate in remainder from his uncle Wm. King, who died without children Gen. Preston's and King's works in the first lease to Col. White were rented at $30,000 each per annum, but have not been so productive of late years as is understood. "During the year 1832, Gen. Preston not being satisfied with the goodness of his well, employed Mr. Anthony, an ingenious mechanic and partner of Dubrough's in a patent plan of boring, to sink cast iron tubes of five inch bore 218 feet or the depth necessary, where was found a supply of salt-water, sufficient for 400 bushels of salt daily, the water being stronger than any known, 22 to 24 gallons producing 50 lbs. salt. "The space in which good saltwater can be procured in large quantities is very small—in the vicinity of Saltville has been expended above $40 000 in fruitless digging and boring by the owners of land. Preston's new tubed well is only 40 yards from King's, and an experiment on King's land, within 40 feet of the old well made last month, produced no water at the depth of 270 feet, though the borings were for many feet through the salt rock, and partly through gypsum, blue and red clay and half formed sand stone.—The formation below the depth of 200 feet, in which salt-water is found, seems to be on a slaty basis, at an inclination of about 15 degrees facing the south east, and in King's old well, whence has been drawn water for 40,000 bushels of salt in the last 60 days, there are large irregular columns of plaster or gypsum, and a plaster roof supporting the ground above, the interior clay for 40 or more feet in some directions having been washed away. Into these openings near 100 cords of wood were thrown, but all disappeared. From all the borings and the most careful observation, it is evident, at this place, that both the sand-stone and plaster are above, and of more recent formation than the muriate of soda. "The crater-like sides of the transition rocks exposed around Saltville, at some points, into which the plaster never intrudes, has given rise to a conjecture, that at some ancient period, the plane on which stands Saltville, was as high as the adjacent hills; and that by a dissolution of the saline substratum which the river (being lower) may have received, the upper earth gave way, throwing the rocks into their present disjointed state, and the surface of all which has been levelled by the washings from the hills, and by the imperceptible workings of time; and this conjecture would seem to be supported by the numerous bones and teeth of the Mastodon and other animals found at any depth yet approached. "The surface of the salt-water being some thirty feet higher than the river water, has suggested to Mr. Anthony the use of a syphon, half a mile in length to draw the water from the well, without a force pump; and the facility of conveying the water to wood or more convenient points of navigation, is now clearly tested by its transfer in tubes two miles. Salt at the works is now reduced to two cents per pound, which will, no doubt, cause more economy to be used in its manufacture and transportation; so far, there appears, however, to have been no advantage taken of the great evaporating improvements used at the salines in New York, or the sugar factories of the South. At Saltville, the furnaces are trenches dug in the earth, the kettles several inches thick—the furnace doors large and open, and placed under open sheds; and in some instances streams of fresh water sweeping from the hills issue out of the furnace flues; but doubtless the present proprietors will make the necessary improvements. The salt made is free from all impurity, its chrystals are large by slow, and fine by rapid evaporation; and white and brilliant, and when thrown from the basket, soon becomes as dry as corn meal, never deliquescing or giving off any water, even in the wettest weather. No settling or clarifying process is necessary, the water being a clear semi-transparent, somewhat whitish fluid, which after being released from its great pressure in the deep parts of the well, seems incapable of holding in solution, the former quantity of saline material. The slight excess of muriatic acid over the soda is united in the boiling with some free gypsum, and precipitated to the bottom, where attaching itself to the mettle and becoming heated, additions of salt are constantly made, till it endangers breaking the kettle, and is very difficult (once weekly) to separate from the iron by pick-axes. In the whole process of manufacturing this water, no trace of lodine or bittern water is to be found—and no species of settling or clarifying is necessary, the salt being deposited as soon as milk warm, is three or four times daily ladled out of kettles of 96 gallons each. At present, meadow lands, pasture and farming to the extent of 2,500 acres appears to be in use; a saw mill, two grist mills and about 100 persons, and as many horses, compose the force of the place; but as the market is limited, and not more than four cords of wood are necessary to make 100 bushels of salt, the apparatus of the place is unnecessarily large and wasteful. "The gypsum-beds on the Saltville lands are perhaps the most convenient and abundant in the world, being only five to ten feet from the surface of the earth and of the very best quality. Hundreds of boats and wagons could be usefully employed in its transportation, as the whole lands of this interior country are admirably adapted to its use." "There are few places in the world which can vie with Saltville in beauty and novelty of scenery. The extended meadows,—rich ridges—high conical peaks,—mountain coves,— clear springs, and the remarkable verdure covering the soil—set off to great advantage the lofty Clinch mountain. The Chilhoway springs are in the vicinity, and often the summer visiters add new interest." Seven Mile Ford, P. O. 362 ms. S. W. by W. of W., and 287 from R. TAZEWELL. Tazewell was created by act of Assembly in 1799, and formed out of portions of Russell and Wythe counties. It is bounded N. by Tug Fork of Sandy river, separating it from Logan,—N. E. by Giles,—E. and S. E. by Walker's mountain, separating it from Wythe,—S. by Clinch mountain, separating it from Smyth,—S. W. by Russell,—and W. by Floyd county, Kentucky. Its mean length is 66? miles, mean breadth 10?; and area 1,305 square miles:—Extending in lat. from 36° 54′ to 37° 32′ N. and in long. from 4° to 5° 12′ W. of W. C. It is situated immediately within the vicinity of the sources of Clinch and Great Sandy rivers. The Clinch takes its rise seven miles N. E. of Jeffersonsville, and pursues a course nearly W. From the eastern section of the county, the great Kanawha receives many tributary branches; the principal of which are the Blue Stone and Wolfe creeks. These have their sources within a few miles of Jeffersonsville, and after some inconsiderable meanderings assume a N. E. direction. This county is traversed by several ranges of mountains, some of which rise to an immense height; the chief of which are the Clinch, Rich, East River, and Paintlick. Their general course is a little S. of W. Between some of these mountains are interspersed beautiful valleys, of a black, deep and rich soil, surprisingly fertile, and perhaps inferior to no county in the state for grass, which thickly covers every cultivated portion to the very tops of the mountains. Ten miles N. E. is Abb's valley a delightful vale.—Situated at its entrance is the Stonefort, a large circular wall of stone, bearing on its image the stamp of great antiquity, from the ages of the trees on it, and various other data. The modern savages that were first found in possession of this county appear totally ignorant, not only of this ancient castle, but of other relics of antiquity in different parts of this valley. Here areslso deposited in lonely caverns, human skeletons of both sexes, and of various ages preserving in their composition an outline of those general features that characterise the Indian race. When brought into contact with the external air, they quickly moulder into dust. Five miles S. W. of Jeffersonsville is a broken continuation of Rich mountain, termed Morris's Nob, a noted object of curiosity. Near its S. W. extremity, and 12 miles from the county seat, is the Maiden Spring Cove, a flourishing settlement, watered by the Maiden Spring, a S. E. branch of Clinch river. On the summit of Rich mountain, in view, and one and a half miles S. is a precipitous ledge of rocks, of stupendous height, called the Peak—commanding a magnificent view of the surrounding country for 20 or 30 miles. From this, some 4 or 5 miles a little S. of E. may be seen on the top of Clinch mountain (immediately before it divides to form Burk's Garden) a romantic assemblage of huge rocks, thrown together by the hand of nature, in the wildest confusion, clothed with a variety of perennial growth and matted with impenetrable thickets of laurel; while far beneath are formed between their interstices, horrible caverns, and subterraneous recesses, the retreat of numerous wild beasts, that frequent the surrounding wilderness, hence its name of Bear Town. On this spot flourishes extensive groves of balsam copavia, a variety of copaifera officinalis and other strange vegetable growth not found elsewhere in this region of country. Inexhaustible quarries of limestone rock, extending in a series of vertical strata from N. E. to S. W. are found in many parts of the county. Stretching across the northern boundary are extensive beds of stone coal of excellent quality. The principle staples are cattle, horses, hogs, feathers, tow and flax-linen, beeswax, genseng, seneca, snakeroot, serpentaria, &amp;c. &amp;c. Compared with the elevation of the water in Great Kanawha, at the influx of the Greenbrier, ascertained to be 1,333 feet, the lowest elevation that can be given to the central mountain valleys of this county must be 1,500 feet; and the mean relative height of the arable soil of the county, at the lowest estimate 1,200 feet. Population in 1830, 5,749. It belongs to the fifteenth judicial circuit and eighth district. Taxes paid state government in 1833, $686 35—in 1834, on lots, $14 88—on land, 313 11—426 slaves, $106 50—2851 horses, $171 06—14 studs, $117 00—5 carryalls, $5 00—Total, $727 55. No report of school commissioner for 1832. Expended in educating poor children in 1833, $184 23. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Blue Stone, P. O. 279 ms. S. W. of R. and 337 S. W. of W.—Situated on Blue Stone river, in the southern part of the county. Burk's Garden, P. O. 274 ms. W. of R. and 349 from W.—Situated 10 ms. E. of Jeffersonsville Burk's Garden is one of the most remarkable spots in Western Virginia, but being out of the track of the tourists, it has not hitherto been described. It is insulated by Clinch mountain, except a narrow pass through which its waters, by uniting into one stream, are discharged into Wolf creek,—its form is somewhat oval, 11 miles long and 5 wide, a beautiful and perfect level, and naturally very fertile. The settlement contains 62 families, amounting to 450 souls. There are 1 house of public worship, free for all denominations, 1 exten- sive manufacturing flour mill, 2 tanyards, and various mechanics. It is well timbered with sugar maple, cherry and white oak. The under growth consists of Crab apple and hawthorn. JEFFERSONVILLE, P. T. and county seat, 352 ms. S. W. by W. of Washington,—290 a little S. of W. from Richmond,—and 30 ms. N. W. by W. of Evansham in Wythe county;—lat. 37° 05′ N. and long. 4° 32′ W. of W. C.—Situated on the south side of Clinch river, one mile from its bank, and near the base of the Rich mountain. Besides the ordinary county buildings, it contains 20 dwelling houses, 1 house of public worship, free for all denominations, 1 common school, 4 mercantile stores, 2 taverns, 1 tanyard, 1 saddler, 6 joiners, 2 boot and shoe factories, 1 blacksmith, 2 hatters, 1 painter and 1 grist mill—and a manufacturing flour mill is situated a mile to the north of the village. Population 150 persons, of whom 2 are attornies, and 2 regular physicians. County Courts are held on the 3d Monday in every month;—Quarterly in April, June, August, and November. Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery are held on the 22d of April and 23d of September, by Judge Estill. Four miles N. W. of this village are situated Cecil's Mineral Springs, which bid fair to rival any mineral waters that have yet been discovered in the western country. TYLER. Tyler was created by Act of Assembly in the year 1814, and formed from a portion of Ohio county. It is bounded N. by Marshall,—N. E. by Greene co. of Pa., and Monongalia of Va.—E. and S. E. by Harrison,—S. and S. W. by Wood,—and W. by the Ohio river, separating it from Washington county, Ohio,—and N. W. by the same river separating it from Monroe county. Its mean length is 27¼ miles—mean breadth 23; and area 855 sq. miles,—extending in lat. from 39° 13′ to 39° 42′ and in long. from 3° 25′ to 4° 12′ W. of W. C. This county declines to the west towards the Ohio, and is drained by Middle Island and Fishing creeks, both running diagonally through the county and emptying into the Ohio. The surface is exceedingly hilly and broken, but the soil is generally of excellent quality. Population in 1820, 2,314,—1830, 4,104. It belongs to the twentieth judicial circuit and tenth district. Tax—no returns. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $259 46—in 1833, $309 23. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Centreville,—situated on the west bank of Middle Island Creek, 7 ms. E. of Middlebourn, and 16 from Sistersville. It contains 15 dwelling houses, 2 mercantile stores, and several mechanics. Fishing Creek, P. O. 330ms. from R. and 266 N. W. by W. of W. This P. O. is situated on the head waters of the creek of the same name, which is a small stream rising in Tyler, flowing nearly N. W. in a winding course, and which about 50 ms. from its source empties into the Ohio about 39 ms. below Wheeling. Grape Island, P. O. 316 ms. from R. and 289 W. of W. Ingram's Mills, P. O. 313 ms. from R. and 279 from W. MIDDLEBOURN, P. V. and seat of justice, 307 ms. from R. and 273 W. of W. in lat. 39° 32′ N. and long. 3° 55′ W. of W., situated on Middle Island creek, 45 ms. S. W. of Wheeling. It contains besides the ordinary county buildings, 25 dwelling houses, 1 Methodist house of worship, 1 common school, 2 mercantile stores, 2 taverns, 1 manufacturing flour mill, 1 tan yard, and 1 saddler. The principal mechanics are cabinet makers, house-joiners, and blacksmiths. In the neighborhood of this place on Middle Island creek, there is an excellent site for a manufactory. The stream is large, and after making a bend, five miles in extent, it returns to within 90 feet of the same bed,—making a fall at the nearest point of approximation of 12 or 15 feet. It is thought that there is an abundance of iron ore and stone coal contiguous to this site. Middle Island creek is one of the principal streams watering this county,—it is about 200 miles in length, running a course east and west through a fertile valley, and emptying into the Ohio river. Population 160 persons; of whom 1 is a resident attorney, and two are regular physicians. County Courts are held on the 2d Monday in every month; Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Judge Fry holds his Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery on the 24th of April and September. Pine Grove, P. O. 327 ms. from R. and 247 W. of W. Sistersville, P. O. 320 ms. from R. and 274 N. W. of W. This village is pleasantly situated on the south bank of Ohio river, 50 ms. N. W. by W. of Clarksburg in Harrison Co., in a remarkably healthy neighborhood, commanding a fine view of the river; and possessing one of the best landings for steamboats and other craft on the Ohio. It contains about 30 dwelling houses, 2 mercantile stores, 2 taverns, a school house, 1 tanyard, and various mechanics.— Population about 200 persons; of whom 1 is a regular physician. This town was laid out in 1814 by commissioners appointed by the Legislature, as the county seat of Tyler; but by a petition presented from the inhabitants at the session of '15 and '16, the Legislature was induced to remove the seat of justice to Middlebourne, 9 ms. nearly east from this place. WASHINGTON. Washington was created by Act of Assembly in 1777, and formed from a portion of the now extinct county of Fincastle. It is bounded N. by Clinch mountain, separating it from Russell,—E. by Smyth,—S. E. by Grayson,—S. by Carter county of Tennessee,—S. W. by Sullivan county of the same state,—and W. by Scott. Mean length (including Smyth) 41 miles,—mean breadth 18?; and area 754 square miles.—We have no means of ascertaining its precise extent since the severance of Smyth; but an approximation may be made by reference to that county. It extends in lat. from 36° 35′ to 36° 52′ N. and in long. from 4° 34′ to 5° 19′ W. of W. C. This county occupies part of the valley between the Blue Ridge and Clinch mountains, and is watered by the North, Middle, and South Forks of Holston, which rise in Wythe and flow through this county, dividing it into three fertile valleys. But Washington is not less celebrated for its valuable minerals, than its fertile soil, excellent pasturage, and delightful climate. The gypsum found in this county in great quantities, is said to be equal, if not superior to that of Nova Scotia, and is now being extensively applied to the same purposes by the farmers of Western Virginia and Tennessee. A full account of its valuable salt works and other minerals has however already been given in connexion with Smyth county,—especially in the article on Saltville,—which village is divided by the line which separates the two counties. Population in 1820, 12,444,—1830, 15,614,—both of which numerations were taken before the severance of Smyth. It belongs to the fifteenth judicial circuit and eighth district. Tax paid in 1834 on lots, $195 25— land, $1,131 96—1122 slaves, $280 50—5364 horses, $321 84—39 studs, $226 00—33 coaches, $94 50—31 carryalls, $31 00—6 gigs, $4 50. Total, $2286 10. The poor children in this county are educated on the district system, and we have no means at present of of ascertaining the exact amount. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. ABINGDON, P. T. and seat of justice, 309 ms. S. W. of R. and 385 S. W. by W. of W. in N. lat. 36° 42′, and long. 4° 58′ W. of W. C. It is situated on the great valley road, about 8 miles N. of the Tennessee boundary,—at the south east side of a mountain ridge, about 7 miles distant from either of the two main, Forks of the Holston river. A part of the town stands on a considerable eminence, beneath which there is a cavern containing a lake. Abingdon contains besides the ordinary county buildings, between 150 and 200 dwelling houses,—many of them handsome brick buildings,—2 Presbyterian and 2 Methodist houses of public worship, all of them neat brick edifices. A portion of the inhabitants are followers of Baron Swedenborg,—in other words, belong to the New Jerusalem Church,—but they possess no house of worship, and their preacher occasionally occupies one or the other of the Metbodist houses. There is an Academy for females and one for males, (both brick edifices,) 2 hotels kept in good style, 3 taverns principally used for the accommodation of wagoners, 1 manufacturing flour mill, 9 mercantile houses, some of which are wholesale establishments, and sell goods to the amount of one hundred and fifty thousand dollars annually, 3 groceries, 1 woolen and 2 cotton manufactures, and 1 well established nursery. There are 4 tanyards with saddle and harness manufacturies attached to them, 10 blacksmith shops, I at manufactory and store, 6 wheelwrights and wagon makers, 2 cabinet warehouses, 3 bricklayers, 2 stone masons, 3 house carpenters, 3 watch makers and jewellers, 2 boot and shoe factories, 3 house and sign painters, 2 coppersmiths and tin plate workers, and 3 tailors. Abingdon is rapidly increasing in population and trade. Old houses are giving place to handsome brick buildings, which the opulent and enterprising citizens are daily erecting. The main street has lately been McAdamized at considerable expense, but greatly to the improvement of its utility, beauty, and comfort. As a specimen of the flourishing condition of this town, we must mention that a quarter acre lot, situated near the court house, recently sold for upwards of $4,000. There is a distributing post office here. Population 1000 persons; of whom 13 are resident attorneys, and 3 regular physicians. County Courts are held on the 4th Monday in every month;—Quarter- 59 ly in March, June, August and November. Judge Estill, holds his Circuit Superior Court of Law and Chancery on the 2d Monday after the 4th of April and September. It may excite some surprise when told that in this large and well populated county, there were in 1831 but two post offices—the one at Abingdon, and the other at Seven Mile Ford; but since the severance of Smyth, the one at Seven Mile Ford is now in that county—in consequence of which we have no knowledge of any other post office in this county except the one at Abingdon the county seat. WOOD. Wood was created by Act of Assembly in the year 1799, and formed from a portion of Harrison county. It is bounded N. E. by Tyler and Harrison,—E. by Lewis,—S. by Kanawha and S. W. by Jackson,—W. by the Ohio river, separating it from Meigs and Athens counties, Ohio—and N. by the same river separating it from Washington county of the same state. Its mean length (before the severance of a portion to form Jackson county) was 40½ miles—mean breadth 30?; and area 1,223 square miles. It extends in lat. from 38° 52′ to 39° 27′ N. and in long from 3° 56′ to 4° 42′ E. of W. C. Nearly the whole of this county is embraced in the valley of the Little Kanawha and its tributaries Hughes' river,—and North Fork of Hughes' river. A small portion on the northwestern border is drained by creeks into the Ohio. The surface is much broken, but the soil is for the most part good. Population in 1820, 5,860,—in 1830, 6,429. It belongs to the nineteenth judicial circuit and tenth district. Tax paid in 1833, $1,150 24—in 1834 on lots, $112 12—land, $885 74—1040 slaves, $260 00—4326 horses, $259 56—26 studs, $223 00—11 coaches, $28 50 —31 carryalls, $32 00—1 gig, 50 cts. Total, $1901 42. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $292 34—in 1833, $533 78. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c Belleville, P. O. distant 314 ms. both from Richmond and Washington. Bull Creek, P. O. 299 ms. W. of W. and 334 from R., situated 13 ms. above Parkersburg in a thickly settled neighborhood. Bull creek is a small stream which rises in Wood county, and empties into the Ohio, 7 miles above Marietta in the State of Ohio. There are located on this creek several mills, mercantile stores, and 1 Baptist house of worship. The land is fertile, producing the ordinary staples,—and is well adapted to grass. Jacksonville, P. O. distant, 281 ms. both from W. and R., situated on the Little Kanawha. It contains 12 dwelling houses, 1 Methodist, and 1 Baptist house of worship, 1 common school, 2 mercantile stores, 1 benevolent society, 1 tan yard, 1 grist and 2 saw mills, and several mechanics. Population 64 persons, of whom 1 is a physician. PARKERSBURG, P. V. and seat of justice, 299 ms. from R. and 299 N. W. of W., situated on the point above the confluence of the Little Kanawha with the Ohio river, 12 ms. below Marietta in Ohio. Besides the ordinary county buildings, it contains 75 dwelling houses, 1 house of public worship (Methodist,) 7 mercantile stores, 4 taverns, 3 common school, 1 steam saw mill, 1 printing office (issuing a weekly paper,) 2 tan yards, 1 saddler, 3 cabinet makers, 2 boot and shoe factories, 2 blacksmith shops, 3 tailors, 2 hatters and 1 rope-walk.

Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery are held on the 1st of April and September, by Judge Summers. Pennsborough, P. O. 303 ms. from R. and 268 from W. Schultz's Range, P. O. 324 ms. from R. and 219 W. of W., situated on the Clarksburg road, on the waters of Cow creek, (6 miles from its mouth,) which empties into the Ohio river;—15 miles from Marietta and 20 from Parkersburg. Schultz's Range is the name of a tract of land, of 25,000 acres laid off in lots of 500 acres each, all of which is in this county. The north western turnpike runs through a part of this tract, on Walker's creek. The range contains 5 families, in all about 30 persons. WYTHE. Wythe was created by act of Assembly at the session of 1789-90, and formed from a portion of Montgomery. It is bounded N. by Giles,—E. by Montgomery,—S. by the Iron mountain, separating it from Grayson,— W. by Smyth,—and N. W. by Walker's mountain, separating from Tazewell. The greater part of Wythe is situated in a mountain valley included between the Iron mountains and Walker's mountain. Its mean length (before a portion was taken to form Smyth) was 45½ miles,—its mean width 22? and its area 1998 square miles. It extends in lat from 35° 44′ to 37° 11′ N., and in long. from 3° 34 to 4° 20′ W. of W. C. Wythe valley is an elevated table land. From the south western part flow the head waters of the Middle Fork of Holston, interlocking sources with some of the branches of New river, which flows across the eastern angle of this county. The characteristic features of the scenery of this river are its sublimity,—its banks are generally terrible cliffs, and toppling precipices of solid limestone, often hundreds of feet in height, and inaccessible to any foot save those of the bird and reptile. There are few plains on this river, and those few are comparatively small, rarely if ever extending to the width of half a mile. The principal creeks, are Red, Cripple, Peak, Cove and Walker's, tributaries to New river on its northern side, and Big and Little Island and Poplar camp creeks on the southern. The first named creeks run S. of E., the latter N. E. The grandest and most prominent features of this county, are its mountains. Of these the largest is called Walker's mountain, which together with other smaller ones, such as Little Walker's mountain, Brushy, Little Brushy, Cove and others, lie between the Iron mountain on one side, and the Garden mountain, Clinch mountain and others (not however in Wythe but the adjoining counties) which are parts of the Blue Ridge on the other. The general course of all these mountains is from N. E. to S. W. and they are generally connected with each other by spurs. There are two other mountains in this county, which are detached chains,—the one called the Lick, and the other Draper's mountain, the former being some 12 or 15 miles in length, the latter 6 or 8. The "Rich Valley of Holston" lying on the North Fork of that river commences with the head of the stream in the N. W. part of Wythe. That part of it lying in this county, has a pre-eminent claim to the title. There is in the eastern part of this county a valley called Draper's valley, a delightful tract of some 5 or 6 miles in length, and ranging in breadth from half to one and a half miles, having Draper's mountain on its N. side, and on the other, hills and highlands. The soil of Wythe cannot be said to be rich, but sufficiently fertile to produce all the necessaries of life. It possesses the characteristic of all the soil of western Virginia, the faculty of renewing itself in grass, and is peculiarly benefitted by the cultivation of clover. Many if not all of the farmers are learning to use gypsum, and find it peculiarly beneficial. Small gram of all kinds is raised with facility, as also corn and potatoes,—the latter of the finest quality. Fruits of all the common kinds, such as apples, pears, cherries, plums and peaches are easily produced, but the lateness of the season, and shortness of the summer often cuts off the hopes of the inhabitants in the bud. Wythe is rich in minerals. Iron is abundant almost every where. Lead is found on the river in abundance, and is worked with profit. There are three establishments for making lead in the county, and which manufacture about 200 tons per annum. There is one iron manufactory in operation. Gypsum is found in Wythe, though not so abundant as in the neighboring county of Smyth. There are large beds of coal in this county, untouched for want of a turnpike or some improved means of transportation. No county in the state suffers more than Wythe for want of internal improvements. Her mineral wealth has hardly commenced a developement, and must probably lie dormant another century, until there shall be more public spirit, or less sectional feeling in the legislature. There have been some copper and silver specimens found in working the lead mines, but in no great quantities. The elevation of Wythe is about 1600 feet above the level of the ocean. Population in 1810, 8,356—1820, 9,692—1830, 12,163. It belongs to the 16th judicial circuit and 8th district. Tax paid in 1833, $1,805 59—in 1834, on lots, $112 12—on land, $985 74—1,040 slaves, $260 00—4,326 horses, $259 56—26 studs, $223 00—11 coaches, $28 50—31 carryalls, $32 00—1 gig, 50 cents. Total $1,901 42. Expended in educating poor children in 1832, $373 53—in 1833, $408 60. TOWNS, VILLAGES, POST OFFICES, &amp;c. Austinville, P. O. 265 ms. from R. and 341 from W. Draper's Valley, P.

Population 15 The soil of the surrounding country is fertile, producing well Indian corn wheat, rye, oats, buckwheat and potatoes. It is also well adapted to pasturage. Extensive iron works are carried on in this neighborhood. EVANSHAM or WYTHE C. H. P. V. 253 ms. S. W. of R. and 329 S. W. by W. of W., in lat. 36° 56′ N. and long 4° 5′ W. of W. C. Besides the ordinary county buildings, this village contains from 90 to 100 dwelling houses, 1 house of public worship, (Methodist,) 9 miscellaneous stores, 2 cabinet makers, 1 painter and glazier, 1 coppersmith, 1 tin plate worker, 4 boot and shoe makers, 2 tanyards, 3 saddlers, 1 printing office, issuing a weekly paper, 4 taverns and 6 blacksmith shops. Population about 600 persons; of whom 7 are attornies and 5 regular physicians. County Courts are held on the 2d Monday in every month;—Quarterly in March, June, August and November. Circuit Superior Courts of Law and Chancery are held on the 7th of April and September by Judge Brown. Early Traditions.—There is much traditionary lore in this county among the old settlers. One romantic circumstance, though not exactly inaccordance with this work, may be worth recording as evincing the difficulties of various sorts, which occurred in first settling the frontier counties of the state. The incident alluded to, is that a man by the name of White, who lived on Walker's creek, was out with General Rogers Clarke. The General being in want of intelligence as to the future plans of the enemy, and being desirous of obtaining information, sent out White by himself to bring him in an Indian. White went out, and after two days unsuccessful hunt returned without one. The General still being determined to have an Indian, sent White out the second time, saying take companions if you will. White being remarkable for size, strength, agility, courage and prudence, selected two men, and started with the determination of having an Indian if he went to Canada for him. After a days travelling they struck on a faint trail, which, by the middle of the third day, took them to an Indian village. White cautiously crept up to reconnoitre, and discovered a large muscular Indian, sitting on a log with his back towards the whites, and facing the Indian encampment, engaged in mending a moccasin. The Indian was partially concealed by a tree, under which he was sitting, from the view of the villagers. White at once, though fully aware of the danger of the attempt determined to carry that Indian to Clarke, and leaving his companions, not thinking it prudent for the three of them to proceed for fear of discovery, he crept softly up behind the Indian, who sat perfectly unconscious of danger; till he felt the grasp of White on his throat, and saw a pistol presented at his head. White in a few hurried words, in the language of the tribe, told him that if he made any noise o resistance he would shoot him instantly through the head, but if he went with him quietly he would promise he should return to his tribe. The Indian submitted to his fate and White carried him in triumph to Clarke, who immediately on seeing him, said "this is no Indian," enquiry being made of the prisoner who and whence he was, he said that he was born of white parents, that when a small boy, the Indians attacked the settlement, killed all the family save his elder brother, who escaped during the onset, and took him prisoner. He described the place from which he was taken. During the recital, the countenance of his captor appeared very much agitated, he asked him several abrupt questions as to his early rememberances, and finally cried out, I am your Brother." All circumstances went to confirm the truth of this assertion, even to the similarity of persons. The exile was restored to society, and for many years sat in the legislature of Kentucky, but still so far retained his old habits and predilections as to spend months at a time in the woods.

()Those counties in brackets have been created since the Constitution, from portions of the districts to which they have been assigned. The arrangement of the counties into Congressional Districts since the last census, is given after the District of Columbia. DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA. ESTABLISHMENT, SITUATION, BOUNDARIES AND EXTENT. The sixteenth clause of the eighth section of the first Article of the Constitution of the United States gives to Congress the power "To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such district (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of government of the United States."—In pursuance of this power General Washington, by authority from Congress, after great research and observation selected the present District of Columbia, as the site for the metropolis of this Great Empire of Confederated Republics. It was ceded in 1790 by the states of Virginia and Maryland to the United States, and became the seat of government in 1800. It lies upon both banks of the Potomac, in form an exact square of 10 miles, containing of course 100 square miles, or 64,000 acres. Two of its sides run in a N. E. and S. W. direction,—at right angles to the other two running in a S. E. and N. W. direction. It extends in lat. from 38° 46′ 30″ to 38° 58′ N. nearly; and the long. of the capitol (which we assume as zero with respect to all other places in this country) has been found by accurate astronomical calculations to be with reference to Greenwich, the English point of reference, 76° 55′ 30″ west. The District on the Virginia side is bounded by the county of Fairfax, and on the Maryland,—by Prince George county on the S. E. and Montgomery county on the N. W. The location of the District having been determined on, the first stone to mark its boundary was set in Jones's Point, the uppermost cape of Hunting creek, on the 15th of April, 1791, in presence of a large concourse of spectators. Of the 100 miles square included in the District, 36 lying south of the Potomac, and included in the county of Alexandria, were ceded by Virginia. A strip 10 miles long, by about 8 broad lying N. of the Potomac and comprehended in Washington county was ceded by Maryland. The surface of the District is gently undulating, affording fine sites for the cities within its limits. In a commercial view its situation is highly favorable. Ships of any draught can be navigated to Alexandria, and those of very considerable size to the Navy Yard on the East branch of the Potomac, at Washington. The Chesapeake and Ohio canal, and the fine roads which the government has made in every direction, also contribute much to its commercial advantages. SOIL. There is as much variety of soil as of surface in the District. The hills are for the most part covered with forests, and the vales are cultivated or covered with wild shrubbery, presenting a landscape, almost every where, of great beauty. Springs of the finest quality abound. Rock creek, Tiber creek, and the Eastern Branch of the Potomac on the north,—and Oxen Run on the south,—and Four Miles Run on the west,— irrigate a great portion of the District. The Potomac presents a vast sheet flowing from N. W. to S. E. Viewed from Fort Washington,—with the mouth of the Eastern Branch on the left,—the main stream on the right,—and the opening of Four Miles Run in front, it presents the appearance of a great inland sea, rather than of a river. The composition of the soil on the banks of the Potomac and the Eastern Branch, is a deep alluvial—rich and various—accumulated from the depesites of successive ages,—and the gradual retreat of the waters. Fragments of primitive rocks, pyrites, gravel, sand, shells and decayed vegetable substances are mingled together. The soil generally near the river is fertile and productive, elsewhere rather thin, and sometimes sandy; but susceptible of great improvement. The most forbidding and barren looking with ordinary attention, and by the use of manure and gypsum, may be fertilized to an extraordinary degree. With such a soil, nothing is wanting but enterprise and perseverance to change the face of nature from a barren-waste, to a blooming garden, and one would think that a market of sufficient extent to stimulate to the requisite exertion was presented almost at the very doors of the farmer and horticulturist;—if indeed the facilities for water transportation afforded by the Potomac and its branches do not bring the more distant, but more fertile portions of Virginia and Maryland into injurious competition. The Rock creek lands are of a light, loamy nature, with a substratum of clay. The staple produce of the country is the same with that grown in the adjoining portions of Virginia and Maryland, viz. tobacco, wheat, Indian corn, fruit, and the esculent roots. There is near the District, on Acquia creek, an extensive quarry of freestone, and on the Seneca one of beautiful variegated marble, or pudding stone from which the columns in the Hall of the House of Representatives were made. The composition of the city low grounds, lying below the hights, from the Capitol to Halorama and to the margin of the Potomac, are alluvial, and appear to have been reclaimed but recently. Within the memory of many now living, seines have been hauled, and fish taken, where handsome stores now stand, in the part of Pennsylvania Avenue in which most business is now carried on, namely—between 9th and 10th streets. The extent of the marshes below Columbia College bears evidence that a part of the stream of Rock creek once found its way across towards the Eastern Branch, along the foot of the hights which flank the northern part of Washington. By judicious draining these swamps have been recently limited to a comparatively small space, but their existence has still an injurious effect upon the health of the inhabitants residing in their vicinity. This fact is clearly established by the improvement of the health of all situated in the vicinity of the low grounds from the centre market to Capitol Hill. 60 Pieces of sound timber are often discovered from ten to fifty feet below the surface. In digging wells, several pieces of black looking limbs of frees, and entire roots have been found at a considerable depth.—An extensive stratum of carbonated limbs of trees has been discovered near Bladensburg, and north of the City, and traced for a considerable distance. Many of the blocks of stone that compose the walls of the Capitol contain specimens of the leaves of trees, and ligneous fragments,—and when exposed to the air they have sometimes shrunk. On turning up the surface of the soil some curiosities of Indian origin have been found. Round stone vessels in the shape of common pots, or bowls, and stone axes are sometimes picked up. A good specimen of an Indian axe in excellent preservation was found on the farm of Mr. Dunlop in Montgomery county, Md.—and is yet in his possession. Points of darts, and arrow heads of stone, used in Indian warfare are met with in many parts of the District. In some ancient records an Indian fort is mentioned, as standing on the banks of the Eastern Branch, not far from the spot on which the powder magazine is now located,—but there are now no traces of t to be found. The temperature of the water of the city springs, when brought to the surface of the earth at midsummer may be set down at 58° of fahrenheit,— the Bladensburg chalybeate at 64°,—and the stream of the Potomac at 85°, —and the water in the hydrants in Pennsylvania Avenue generally, where the pipes are sunk to a proper depth, at 56°, though it may issue from the fountain at 58°. GEOLOGY AND MINERALOGY A few years ago a correspondent of a New York print, (generally understood to be an intelligent member of Congress) took a glance at some of the prominent geological features of this District; and although there be some imagination in the sketch, yet, there is enough of science to justify its insertion. It is obvious, says he to the most careless observer, that over the site of the Capitol of the United States, and the country far around, the waves of the ocean once rolled, and that these fields, now quietly tilled by the planter, were thrown from beneath it by some tremendous convulsion. Where the great concerns of this nation are now canvassed, and our politicians are imagining that they may provide for the perpetuity of our republic, memory, as if mocking their schemes, points to the period when the monsters of the deep flowed over the spot; and no human being conceived that the waters would not continue to hide it forever. The proofs of the amazing changes are numerous and conclusive. It is announced by the strata of earth; by the rounded stones, like those which grind and polish each other on the sea shore, and by the numerous secondary formations, which without analysis, instruct us satisfactorily on the slightest inspection. In many of the stones found even on the hights around us, are distinct impressions of marine shells. The lime of which these shells were constituted, has been decomposed, and has vanished or been incorporated with the general mass, which, when broken, exhibits the concave and convex surfaces of the marine substance, and the vacant space produced by the slow waste of ages not now to be numbered. These stones are of various composition, some being exceedingly hard, and other soft, and others having the character of the coarse grey sandstone, or what has I think erroneously been called granular-quartz." The material of the soil is clay, discolored by the oxide of iron. It becomes fixed by fire, and no place can boast of greater facilities for brick making. Rock creek, and its immediate vicinity, is the line between the primitive formation and the tertiary; from Rock creek up the Potomac, the borders of the stream is pregnant with primitive rocks in situ and in boulders, with the exception of a few small pieces of alluvial soil here and there, in the valley of the river. This is the case for twenty miles or more, when the country changes to old red sandstone, which continues 20 or 25 miles further up the river, with occasional ridges of brecca or pudding stone: marble shows itself in various places along the valley below and above Monocacy. About a mile, however, east of the entrance of Rock creek into the Potomac, on the southern point of the city, near the Glasshouse, the final termination of the primitive rocks that line the bed and banks of the Potomac above, clearly takes place. In digging wells beyond this point, rocks or stones seldom obtrude, the alluvial soil every where prevails.—Rock creek separates the primitive from the alluvial soil. In the former gneiss abounds, which is succeeded by the amphibolic rock or grunstein. The gneiss contains small crystalised tubes of magnetic iron, veins of feldspath and quartz of opaque white color. The rock of the Great Falls of the Potomac consists chiefly of micaceous schist,—the mica schistoide of Hauy, or glimmer schiefer of the Germans, and contains grains of iron which attract the magnetic needle. The stone, with which the basins of the Potomac canal are lined, is a species of sandstone (gris) similar to that known by the name of gris des mouilliores [sandstone of coal-beds]. The rock employed to form the foundation or base of the houses of Washington, is a species of gneiss, composed of feldspath, quartz and mica, of a leafy texture, owing to the abundance and disposition of the mica. It contains primitive sulphurous iron—and also particles of the same metal, which are attracted by the needle. At Fort Washington there is a ferruginous clay, known by the name of bd which is employed to dye cloth and thread, of a reddish color. This substance, when heated, attracts the magnetic needle. The moulds of petrified shells of the genus arca weighing several pounds, have been dug up at this place. Robinson, in his catalogue of American mineralogy, furnishes the following for the District of Columbia. Flint,—on the shores of the Eastern branch of the Potomac near the Navy Yard, in small nodules,—Hornstone, containing organic remains, agatized wood, woodstone,—three miles north from Washington, sometimes invested with minute crystals of quartz,—fine specimens and abundant. Schorl—In Georgetown—in gneiss—lignite and pyritical fossil wood are found abundantly in digging wells. Iron ore—in the vicinity of the woodstone locality, in detached masses on the surface—organic remains in sandstone—abundant. CLIMATE. The prejudices that some time back existed averse to the general health of the District, have been dissipated by the monthly publication of meteorological observations, and the interments in the public grave yards, authenticated by the board of health. The climate of course resembles that of the adjoining parts of Maryland and Virginia. The severity of the winters, or cold seasons, is no doubt of late years much mitigated. In 1780, Mr. Jefferson says, the Chesapeake bay was solid ice from its head to the mouth of the Potomac. At Annapolis, where it is 5¼ miles between the nearest points of land, the ice was from 5 to 7 inches thick quite across, so that loaded carriages went over it. In January, 1772, the snow in the District of Washington was nearly three feet deep, and in some places it drifted to ten or twelve feet. Of late years not more than as many inches have fallen. Formerly the river, near Dumfries, was frequently frozen over in November,—heavy snows fell in the same month, and loaded the forest trees, till their branches broke under the pressure. The climate, as cultivation progresses, is rapidly improving. The District is now seldom visited with the long or severe winters, of which our early settlers so feelingly complained. France, as well as America, in its uncultivated state, had hard winters.—In the time of Julius Cæsar, the Rhine was frozen over, and neither the olive nor the vine was then cultivated. A Gallic winter, once proverbially severe, is now, under a state of high cultivation, mild and pleasant. In the days of Horace, mountains near Rome were covered with snow. The climate of Britain, however, is a remarkable exception; it appears, in our days, to continue as it was, in the times of Tacitus, moist, cloudy, and rainy.—So we are encouraged, on the authority of the ancients to look forward to a progressive improvement and material mitigations on the rigors of winter, when our soil shall be more generally opened by cultivation; we may not then be tortured with those extremes of heat and cold, under which we now labor, varying from 18° below zero, to 98° above, of fahrenheit. In summer, the District is visited with frequent thundergusts, though, on the whole they are beneficial, as they tend to purify the atmosphere, and mitigate the sultriness of the season, which is often as oppressive as within the tropics. The most remarkable of these tempests or tornadoes occurred in June, 1811, and August, 1814 during the former, large hailstones weighing three or four ounces, fell, and destroyed every pane of glass on the north side of the houses in Alexandria, and in the latter instance, many houses were blown down and trees laid prostrate, much to the terror of the British, who at that time held for 24 hours the occupation of the city. We have no doubt that the degree of caloric has considerably increased, since the forest trees were cut down on our commons, and wide gravelled avenues formed: the difference of temperature in favor of the forest shade is, by some philosophers, reckoned at one fifth less than on an open space. Bordering as the District does on so many water courses, it may be naturally presumed, that its inhabitants, in the summer months, are not free from the annoyance of insects. The musquetoe is the most formidable of this description; but houses on an elevated site, or with a thorough draught of air, are seldom troubled with them. On the low grounds, and on the borders of swamps, ephemeral insects, chiefly of aquatic origin, in swarms of various descriptions, make their appearance, musquetoe curtains, however, so common in Carolina, are here very seldom required for the comforts of the bed chamber. It may naturally be expected that the sudden changes of the atmosphere, —though in sound constitutions, they may harden the body,—yet with the more delicate, produce in winter and spring, colds, coughs, rheumatic affections,—and in the fall, bilious fevers, agues, &amp;c. nevertheless that part of the District in which Washington is located, is at least as healthy, if not more so, than any other portions of the Union, containing an equal number of inhabitants. ABORIGINES. Of the aborigines of the District we have a very imperfect account. In 1608 the first attempt to explore the Chesapeake and its tributary streams was made by Smith. Forty principal and subordinate tribes, occupied the shores of Virginia and Maryland at the time, of whom the Powhatans, the Manahoacs and Monacans were the chief. The Powhatans roamed from the shores of the Chesapeake to the Patuxent in Maryland the Manahoacs and the Monacans on the territory contiguous to York and Potomac rivers. The Shawanees probably inhabited that part of Maryland which lies between the Patuxent and the Patapsco rivers, and from the Chesapeake to the Alleghanies. The Susquehanocks, it is believed, lived on the banks of the Susquehannah in Harford county, Maryland, towards the westward, penetrating considerably into Pennsylvania. The Fockwocks and Nanticokes possessed Kent, Queen Anns and Talbot counties, Maryland, from the Sassafras river to the Choptank; and the latter tribe, Dorchester and Somerset counties. The Manahoacs and Monacans were in alliance with each other, and waged a confederate and perpetual war against the Powhatans. It is probable, and it is generally admitted, that they were occupiers of the territory which forms the present District of Columbia. The Manahoacs, it is asserted by Colden, afterward assumed the name of Tuscaroras, deserted their country in Virginia about 1712, and repairing to the west, joined the Iroquois. In 1669, when a census was taken, it was found that in sixty-two years, one third of their number were wanting. The valley at the foot of the Capitol Hill, washed by the Tiber creek, the Potomac and the Eastern Branch, it is stated on the authority of some of the early settlers, was periodically visited by the Indians; who named it their fishing ground, in contradistinction to their hunting ground; and that they assembled there in great numbers in the spring months to procure fish. Greenlief's Point was the principal camp and the residence of the chiefs, where councils were held among the various tribes thus gathered together. The coincidence of the location of the National Legislature, so near the site of the council house of an Indian nation, cannot fail to excite interesting reflections in the mind of the intelligent reader. It is highly probable that General Washington was acquainted with this tradition.

Alexandria originally called Belhaven, a Post Town and Sea Port, situated on the western bank of the river Potomac, near the head of tide water, on the south corner of the District, 6 miles south of the City of Washington, and 180 ms. from the ocean. The meridian of Washington passing through the Capitol, leaves the cential part of Alexandria, near 3′ to the E.—Lat. of Alexandria 38° 48′ N. This town lies principally in the District of Columbia, but a small part of it is in the state of Virginia. It was incorporated in 1779 by the state of Virginia, and that part of it which lies within the District was ceded to the General Government in 1801. The laws of Virginia, enacted previous to that time, still remain in force in the town and county of Alexandria, except those which have been repealed by Congress. The municipal government consists of a Council of 16 representatives and a Mayor Four members of the Council are annually elected in each of the 4 wards into which the City is divided, and the Mayor is elected every year by the Council. The political situation of Alexendria in common with the other portions of the District of Columbia is singular. The President of the United States is the Governor, and Congress, the Legislature of the District, but the people have no voice nor are their sentiments officially heard, in any of the political concerns of the country. The Circuit Court of the United States, for the District of Columbia, sits in Alexandria twice a year, and its expenses are defrayed by the General Government. From the decision of the Court, there are appeals to the Supreme Court of the United States. Alexandria is very handsomely situated. The streets are laid out on the plan of Philadelphia, crossing each other at right angles and are generally well paved. It is consider- ed remarkably healthy, and the view from the City is very fine. The town is situated in the bottom of a valley which to the eye of an observer is terminated in every direction by lofty and verdant hills. To the north he sees the City of Washington,—the Capitol with its beautiful columns, white walls and towering dome, forming a most conspicuous object; to the south, the broad translucent expanse of the Potomac opens upon him, with Fort Washington, lying like a white line on its distant margin, opposite to Mount Vernon. The river opposite to the town is a mile in breadth, and varies from 34 to 52 feet in depth, in the ship channel, which here washes the shore,— of course the harbor is naturally very fine, and it has been much improved by the erection of large and commodious wharves. Commerce.—Alexandria carries on an extensive trade in flour, tobacco, sumach, fish, lumber and other articles, with the Southern states West Indies and Europe. Barrels. Half Barrels, The inspection of flour in 1829, was 178,874, and 5,789 The inspection of flour in 1830, was 166,386, and 6,385 The inspection of flour in 1831, was 206,294, and 6,001 Besides an extensive trade with the eastern ports of the United States, the exports to foreign countries for the last 3 years, were in amount as follows: 1829, $687,259 1830, 628,142 1831, 864,484 On the 31st of December 1831 the tonnage belonging to the town was 8,230 tons, and it is still increasing. There are 3 Banks in Alexandria with an aggregate capital of one million, seven hundred thousand dollars, and 3 incorporated insurance companies. The amount of real estate is assessed at two millions seven hundred thousand dollars; and according to authentic information from the treasury department of the United States, the town paid into the treasury from the 31st of December 1791 to the 31st December 1829 inclusive, on account of customs, three millions, seven hundred and thirty seven thousand, one hundred and sixty one dollars and twenty seven cents,—on account of the post office, one hundred and seventy three thousand, seventy three dollars and thirty four cents,—for direct tax in the years 1815-16, eleven thousand, one hundred and fifty dollars and seventy cents. The amount of internal revenue which cannot be accurately ascertained would swell the clear revenue from the town of Alexandria, during the period above mentioned, to upwards of four millions of dollars. Religious and Moral Associations, Manufactories, &amp;c.— There are in this town 9 houses of public worship, 2 Episcopalian, 2 Presbyterian, 1 Friends', 2 Methodist, 1 Catholic and 1 Baptist. There is also a philosophical society, and an incorporated Library, containing about 4,000 volumes, a Library instituted by an association of apprentices and other minors, a savings fund institution, an orphan asylum, a poor house and dispensary, a bible, missionary and temperance society, a colonization society, a benevolent society for improving the condition of the people of color, a society for furnishing employment to the industrious, indigent, and several for supplying food, clothing and fuel to the poor in winter. There are several baking establishments, where ship bread and crackers are made equal to any manufactured in the United States or elsewhere, 2 ship yards, an extensive brewery, and several tanneries, a foundry upon a large scale, with a manufactory of steam engines and various machinery for cotton factories, &amp;c. and several manufactories of segars, on an extensive scale. Alexandria contains a handsome market house, at which a market is held every morning. It is generally well supplied with meats, fish, fruits and vegetables in their season. In the latter part of the spring, wild strawberries abound in the adjacent country, and are brought in great quantities to market. Over the market house is the Court-house, clerk's office, council chamber, town hall and library; and in the upper story of the same building an extensive and well arranged Museum. Over the centre of this building is a steeple in which an excellent clock tells the hours on a bell, that weighs fifteen hundred pounds. There is a boarding school for young men, in which the languages, mathematics, philosophy, and every useful branch of education is taught. A part of the course consists of a series of lectures on astronomy, chemistry, &amp;c. in which the principles of the sciences treated of are illustrated by experiments with suitable apparatus. There are also boarding schools for young ladies, conducted by ladies, in which are taught all the branches of polite and fashionable education, and a boarding school for young ladies under the charge of Four Sisters of Charity from Emmittsburg, in the state of Maryland. This institution, though but lately established, and not yet completed, is in a flourishing condition. When finished it will have connected with it an orphan asylum. There are also in Alexandria, free schools for children of both sexes, and about 30 other schools, exclusive of Sunday schools. In the vicinity of Alexandria is established a Protestant Episcopal Theological Seminary on an elevated situation, commanding an extensive and delightful view of the District of Columbia, the river Potomac and the surrounding country. This institution at present occupies two large four story buildings, having space enough between them for the erection of a centre structure. Population of Alexandria at different periods.

This canal is designed to continue the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal to Alexandria, and will be connected with that great work by a magnificent aqueduct thrown across the river Potomac, immediately above Georgetown. The perpendicular descent from the surface of the river, above the Little Falls to tide water, is about 36 feet and as the canal will be brought on a level from the head of the Falls to Alexandria; it is obvious that at the latter place, it will afford water power for manufactories to a very great extent. Towards the construction of the Alexandria canal, the government of the United States have appropriated $100,000. This city is connected with the interior of the state of Virginia by several turnpike roads,— down which the principal part of the flour is brought that comes to market; and there are 8 steamboats that regularly ply between this and other ports, several of which arrive and depart daily. Fisheries.—As Alexandria is the shipping port of the District of Columbia, and one of the principal marts for the immense fisheries of the Potomac, it may be well to mention, that in the spring of the year quantities of shad and herrings are taken, which may appear almost incredible. The number of shad frequently obtained at a haul is 4,000 and upwards, and of herrings from 1 to 300,000. In the spring of 1832, there were taken in one scine at one draught, a few more than 950,000 accurately counted.— The prosecution of the numerous fisheries gives employment to a large number of laborers, and affords an opportunity to the poor to lay in at very reduced prices, food enough to last their families during the whole year. The shad and herrings of the Potomac are transported by land, to all parts of the country, to which there is a convenient access from the river; and they are also shipped to various ports in the United States and West Indies. The lowest prices at which these fish sell when just taken, are 25 cents per thousand for herrings, and $1 50 per hundred for shad, but they generally bring higher prices, often $1 50 per thousand for the former, and from $3 to 4 per hundred for the latter,—in the height of the season a single shad weighing from 6 to 8 pounds, is sold in the market of the District for 6 cents. Herrings, however, are sometimes taken so plentifully, that they are given away, or hauled on the land as manure for want of purchasers. Some idea may be formed of the importance of these fisheries from the following statement.— Number of fisheries on the Potomac, about 150 Number of laborers required at the Landing 6,500 61 Number of vessels employed, 450 Number of men to navigate these vessels, 1,350 Number of shad taken in good season, which lasts only about 6 weeks, 22,500,000 Number of herrings under similar circumstances, 750,000,000 Quantity of salt required to cure the fish,—Bushels, 995,000 Number of barrels to contain the fish, 995,000 The herring is not eaten at the best tables when fresh, but cured, they are admired by all, keep remarkably well, and are most highly flavored when they have been for 2 years in salt. The Potomac river can boast of the largest shad fisheries in the United States. The advantages of the herring fisheries, she divides with some other rivers of the south, but it is equalled by none, unless it be the Susquehanna. Should the Chesapeake and Ohio canal be continued to the Ohio river, it is obvious that the fisheries of the Potomac will be of great advantage to the country west of the Alleghany mountains, in supplying in great abundance a delicious and valuable article of food of which its waters are entirely destitute. Taken into view the vast number of fish annually caught, and the probable increase in the demand, one might be led to fear that the supply will at length be exhausted,—however ample at the present time, but when we reflect that the spawn from an exceeding small number will generate into myriads and myriads of fish, such a fear is at once done away; the quantity is now very great and increasing,—it is admitted that next to the small and delicate Nova Scotia herring, that of the Potomac is by far more nutricious than any found elsewhere in the waters of North America. During the summer, the fall, and winter months, the variety of good fish is small, consisting principally of the large white perch and rock fish of moderate size, taken with the line, and of carp and winter shad; but at certain seasons of the year the supply is abundant indeed. In the latter part of the winter and early in spring, great numbers of large rock fish, weighing from 25 to 120 lbs. are taken in seines, just above the salts and brought to the markets in the District of Columbia. About 8 years since there were taken at one of the fisheries on the Virginia side of the river, about 3 miles below Washington,* * The noted fishery called the Sycamore Landing, belonging to Gen. Mason. at one draught of the seine, four hundred and fifty rock fish averaging sixty pounds each, as is well attested, and was recorded in the newspapers of the day. Sturgeon also abounds in the Potomac, and are of enormous size weighing from 75 to 150 pounds, in some places they are considered a great delicacy, as in the James, the Potomac, and the Hudson rivers,—while on the Delaware they are considered worthless and scarcely eaten. The sturgeon comes up the Potomac twice a year, which is in the months of May and August, —presses up to the very foot of the first falls, and is taken in the greatest quantity within the District, in times of freshets in the strong water between Georgetown and those falls. They are taken either in floating nets, with large meshes, or by an ingeniously contrived hook, not baited, but by a curious device, prepared to pierce him on the body so certainly and so deeply, as to hold him and bring him in, notwithstanding his great size and strength; this latter mode of taking the sturgeon is believed to be peculiar to the Potomac.† † "The hook is made of stout, well-tempered iron, keenly pointed and barbed with steel, is about thirty inches in length, bent at the lower end, and much in the way with ordinary fish-hooks, in proportionately larger dimensions, and so as to place the barb on the inside of the curvature; but the stem, or that part to which the line is attached, and which is about twenty-four inches long, instead of being straight, is bent nearly as the segment of a circle, the diameter of which would be equal to the length of the hook—to this circular part is attached an iron weight cylindriacally, formed of three or four pounds weight by a stiff loop, but roomy enough to allow the weight to slide up or down the stem, to which the hook is thrown into the water, this weight not only answers the end of the common sinker to keep the line stretched at the depth required, but by its superior gravity, so soon as it has reached the point prescribed by the length of the line given out, it draws the hook down in a perpendicular position in the direction of the line, and by its power of sliding on the stem of the hook, adjusts itself just at the bottom of this, and where the curvature in the opposite direction, that forms the hook proper, begins, by the instrumentality of this weight so placed, and operating on the peculiar form of the hook—while suspended by a tight line, the hook remains, with the back of the circular stem turned towards the hand of the fisherman that holds the other end of the line, and of course with the barbed end turned from him, whether held still, or kept in motion. Thus prepared the fisherman, sometimes drags, as it is termed, for the sturgeon; that is, he rows his light little boat slowly backwards and forwards, with his line suspended from the stem at a given depth; or, sometimes at anchor he lays in wait, his line stretched perpend cularly under him, with the hook near the bottom —when the fish strikes against any part of the line, it is so stirred by its great weight as to be sensibly felt by the fisherman, who then hauls rapidly but steadily up, until he feels that the hook has come in contact, and has turned suddenly inward, the barbed part towards the fish; when by an instantaneous and strong jerk, he buries the barb in its body. Here is the development of the contrivance of this hook, and here too is exerted all the tact of the fisherman—the hook is drawn up as before described with the convex part of the stem towards the fisherman, the line touching the fish, consequently that part of the stem of the hook attached to the line reaches the fish, with the barb part turned from it, and as the back of the stem is drawn on, being circular, only a small part of it at a time is in contact with the fish; but at a certain point of this contact, near the middle of the entrance of the curve, the weight, from its position below, and the facility with which the stem plays in the open loop, so operates as to cause a sudden turn in the hook and to reverse the position of the barbed end, and threw it directly under the fish, with so smart a tug, that it at once designates to the practised hand of the wary fisherman, the critical instant at which he is to make his last effort; and he succeeds the more readily in the thrust, because from the position of the barb, it is brought up directly against the belly of the fish, which is of soft skin, unprotected by the bony shields dispersed over the back and sides. So soon as the sturgeon is hung, he makes off with great strength and swiftness, the line is plaid out to give him play, and the little boat, if before stationary, is cast loose, so that when the line is out, the boat, to which one end was secured, is for a time darted so rapidly through the water that her bows are brought almost under, his speed however presently slackens, his strength exhausted, and he yields himself up to be drawn in and hoisted on board. An instance occurred near the Little Falls some years ago, of the strength and power of this fish. A noted fisherman, whose name is well known, had incautiously made fast one end of the line to his leg, and having hung a sturgeon, was dragged over board and drawn off by it, to a considerable distance in the river, sometimes above and sometimes under water, but from his interpidity and skill in swimming, he was enabled to get through this perilous conflict safely, and to conquer the sturgeon and tow him on shore, without the aid of his boat. It remains to account, as to this interesting fishing, by which the amateurs for sport, as well as the more humble, for gain, are much attracted, how it happens that the stugeon would seem to seek, rather than avoid the line put out for his destruction, when there is no bait about it to invite him. Sportsmen and fishermen, to be good in their way, as is known, must be well acquainted with the habits of the animal they would circumvent and bring within their toils; the simple solution, in this case, is said to be, that it is the habit of the sturgeon to rub itself against any thing stationary that it meets with in the narrow waters. We can't dismiss this subject without mentioning another singular habit belonging peculiarly to this fish, that of occasionally throwing itself to a considerable distance above water, to the height of at least eight or ten feet, so that in the pause between the ascent and descent, the whole fish is seen suspended in a horizontal position for a moment, in the air. They have sometimes fallen in this way, very much to the risque of those on board, in the boats plying at the Ferry in Georgetown, in this District, and an unfortunate occurrence took place, during the revolutionary war, productive of a most serious accident, on the North river. A sturgeon came down from one of these leaps into a ferry-boat while crossing that river, on the lap of an American officer, who was a passenger and sitting in the sturn, with such violence as to break his thigh and occason his death." Water Fowl.—The celebrity of the water fowl of the Potomac, and the scarcity of information upon the subject, render an article upon them necessary. In the following account we have availed ourselves largely of the information contained under the "Water Fowl," in a useful little work upon the District of Columbia, by Jonathan Elliot, Esq. The summer duck (Anas Sponsa of Wilson,) is the only species of the numerous water fowl which frequent the Potomac, which breed upon its borders; the others are inigratory. The whole tribe has been sensibly diminished of late years, by the new method of taking them which will be presently described, and the increased avidity with which they are sought by persons to supply the markets. They are still, however, numerous,—and consist of various species,—The swan, the wild goose, and a great variety of ducks, as the canvass back, the red head shoveler, the black head shoveler, the duc-a-malard, the black duck, the blue wing teal, the green wing teal, and the widgeon. "Of these, the five species first mentioned are what are called river fowl, frequenting only the fresh river; and the last five kinds are known by the name of marsh fowl, feeding principally in the marshes bordering on the river. Again, of the river fowl—the canvass back, the red head shoveler, and the black head shoveler are denominated drift fowl, from the circumstance of their collecting in vast bodies, when at rest, in the middle of the river, or feeding in deep water, obtaining their food by diving to the bottom. The bald face and the sprig tail, although they avoid the marshes, feed on the margin of the river in shallow water, as do the marsh fowl, by dipping their heads and necks under only, and all these described as marsh fowl, are found feeding on the shores of the rivers occasionally, except the blue winged teal, which frequents the marshes exclusively, and only such as produce the wild oat, his favorite food. This duck too differs from all the others in the time and period of his visits to this quarter of the country; they are earlier made and of shorter duration: he comes about the first of September, and goes about the first of November; all the other kinds of duck arrive with us, as the swan and geese, from the middle of October to the middle of November; and depart from about the first to the middle of March. As to the qualities for the table, of these fowl, the young swan is considered a great delicacy—while the old one is always hard, and without agreeable flavor. The wild goose is deemed much superior to the tame goose. The canvass back, it is known, stands unrivalled in the taste of the epicure, as the most delicious bird in this or any other country. The red head shoveler, and the blue winged teal are but little inferior to it, in the estimation of connoisseurs, in that way; and of all the other kinds of these ducks, there is not one, when in good condition, that is not fine game. Most of them are found in abundance during the season from the immediate vicinity of the city of Washington, down the salts, and some of them are seen in both the salt and fresh water habitually or occasionally. The Swan is not found nearer than about 30 miles below Washington, at the mouth of Occoquan, on the right bank of the river is his highest feeding ground, which is the lowest spawning place of the white shad. Here, and for some 30 or 40 miles below, this noble bird is seen floating near the shores, in flocks of some two or three hundred, white as the driven snow, and from time to time, emitting fine sonorous, and occasionally melodious songs, so loud that they may be heard on a still evening two or three miles; there are two kinds, so called from their respective notes—the one the trumpeter, and the other the slooper; the trumpeter is the largest—and when at full size, will measure from five to six feet from the bill to the point of the toe, and from seven to eight feet from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other, when stretched and expanded. They are sagacious and wary and depend more on the sight than on the sense of smell. On a neck nearly three feet in length, they are enabled to elevate their head so as to see and distinguish with a quick and penetrating eye objects at a great distance, and by means of this same length of neck they feed in slack tides, by immersing, as is their habit, nearly all of the body—and throwing only their feet and tails out, in three or four feet water, and on the flatty shores they frequent, generally beyond gun-shot, the sportsman availing himself however of a peculiar propensity (of which we shall presently speak more particularly) prevailing with them and some of the other water fowl, often toll them within reach of their fire: the swan remain here the whole winter, only shifting their ground in severe weather from the frozen to the open part of the river, and dropping down into the salts where it is rarely frozen. They get into good condition soon after their arrival in autumn, and remain fat until toward spring—when a few weeks before their departure about the first of March, they gradually become thinner in flesh, and in the latter part of their sojourn here, are found so poor and light, that when shot, the gunner gets nothing fit for use but the feathers whether this circumstance be owing to their having exhausted the means of subsistence at their feeding places, or that they are taught by him who rules the universe, in small as well as great things, thus by abstaining, to prepare themselves for the long ærial voyage they are about to undertake, we pretend not to determine with certainty, there is nothing more wonderful in this, than in the fact, which is notorious, that they by exercise, regularly and assiduously fit themselves for this continuous effort, to bear themselves through the air to the distance of perhaps a thousand miles or leagues, large flocks are seen every day rising from the river and taking a high position, flying out of sight and apparently moving in a circuit to a considerable distance, again returning at or near the same place, during the last two or three weeks of their stay.* * Perhaps this exercise may account for the leanness—and perhaps to produce this leanness may be a motive for the exercise. Ed. Gaz. The Wild Goose is yet more wary and vigilant to keep out of harm's way than the swan. He too is sharp sighted, but depends much on his sense of smell for protection; this is so well known to the huntsman, that he never attempts, however he may be concealed from this bird, to approach it from the direction of the wind, since he would assuredly be scented before he could get within gun-shot, and left to lament his error, by the sudden flight of the whole flock. These geese toward spring often alight on the land and feed on the herbage in fields, and sometimes in such numbers as to do great injury to the wheat fields on the borders of the river. When so employed they are difficult of approach, always taking a position at a distance from cover of any kind—and marching in a single and extended rank flanked by a watch goose at each extremity, which, while all the others are busily feeding and advancing with their heads down among the herbage, moves erect, keeping pace with his comrades, his eye and nose in a position so as to convey to him the earliest intelligence of the presence of an enemy, though at a great distance; and the moment such is perceived, it is communicated to the whole company by certain tones used for alarm, and immediately is responded to by a halt and the lifting of heads, and an instant flight, or a deliberate return to feeding takes place, according as the nature of the danger, after the examination may be considered. In the progress of this march the centinels on the flanks are regularly relieved at intervals of some fifteen or twenty minutes, they falling carelessly into the feeding ranks, and others taking in their place the tour of duty on their march. In this arrayed state, they are attacked with great difficulty by the gunner; his only chance of approach, is by means of a horse trained for the purpose—and much precaution is used in this petite guerre. He first, on perceiving the flock feeding in an extensive field—and on none other will they commit themselves—reconnoitres the locale, and takes cognizance of the direction of the wind— he then having observed the course of march, enters the field at a point so remote, as at the same time to escape close scrutiny, and place his game in such a relative situation to him, as that he has the wind,—that is, be the air light or strong,—it is to blow from them toward him, and not from him toward them. Next he is to estimate by the pace at which he finds the flock advancing, and by that he is to assume, under cover of the horse, at about what point, each moving in oblique lines, he will be brought within gun-shot of them. All this being settled in his mind, he commences his movement, first having taken off the saddle and tied up the bridle, so as to show as little as possible of it, he then, with his gun in one hand, and the other on the bridle, places himself on the side of the horse opposite to the game, his legs placed behind the forelegs of the horse, and his body so bent as to be concealed by the shoulder and neck of the horse in this constrained attitude, he urges his faithful coadjutor slowly in the direction fixed on, allowing him every now and then to stop and regale himself on the young wheat or the herbage over which he is making his way. The geese, accustomed, to find the domestic animals, and none more common than the horse, pasturing on the fields they frequent—see in his approach no cause of alarm—and if due precaution has been taken to guard against the snuffing of the taint of man, which there is no question that nature has taught him readily to distinguish, he arrives in due time within the deadly reach, and manœvering a while to get a raking fire, presently deals out destruction on the thus circumvented troop. But to attain the object, great patience and endurance are necessary. Hours are consumed in taking and keeping the position with the requisite accuracy, as we have been assured by our informant, who has been an experienced sportsman in these regions, and often himself gone through the ordeal of wet feet, benumbed hands, bare head, and this crooked position of the body for several hours, on a stretch, watching under the neck of the horse, with snatched glance, the bearing of the centinels, and on the slightest indication of suspicion, setting the horse to feed, with his own limbs and body so disposed behind him as not be exposed to the line of vision from the other quarter until suspicion was lulled again. "Ducks.—Of all the duck tribe, the canvass back, as well on account of their vast numbers, as their superior value, are to be placed in the first class. They breed, as is supposed, on the borders of the northern lakes or of Hudson bay, they come to us periodically, as has been before said, from the north, and what is remarkable, have never before been known to visit, unless rarely and in small numbers, any other than the waters of the Chesapeake—and of these, of late years, they have confined themselves entirely to the Potomac and the Susquehannah. Formerly they frequented also James river, but for the last thirty or forty years have deserted that river altogether; they were called shelldrake there—as they were in those days in the Potomac the white duck—on the Susquehannah, the canvass back; but latterly the name of canvass back has been given to them on both these last named rivers, where they are now only known. It is well ascertained that they feed on the bulbous root of a grass which grows on the flats in the fresh water of these rivers, because it is always found in their craws, and which has very much the color and the flavor of garden celery; it is to this food, that is attributed, and we believe correctly, the peculiarly delicious taste of their flesh. "It is said that during a remarkably hard winter some forty odd years ago, the wind having prevailed a long time from the northwest, and blown so much of the water from the flats of James river, that it froze to the bottom, inclosing the long tops of this grass so closely in the ice, that when it broke up and was floated off in the spring, it tore the whole of it up by the roots and took it away— and that from that time to the present, the canvass back duck ceased to make his annual visit to that river: and it is added, that about the same time the carp-fish ceased to frequent it, and indeed it is affirmed, that this fish is only found in the rivers, to which that duck resorts. If this really be so, it must be, that both are enticed by the same kind of food, or that the grass in question, by some other quality, suits the purposes of the carp fish. "The canvass back feeds in from 6 to 10 feet water: he is an expert diver, and with great strength and agility, seizing it probably near the bottom, eradicates the grass, brings it up root and branch to the surface, where he bites off the root, (which is bulbous, white and about four tenths of an inch across, and six tenths long,) and eating that only, leaves the long herbaceous part to float on the water. "Very frequently there are found feeding among these fowl, the Bald Fall Duck; he has not the power of diving entirely under water in search of his food, and here he is employed in watching the rising of the canvass back, and in snatching the grass from his grasp, much to his annoyance,—and though the bald face is the smaller duck, as he is sprightly and active, he often succeeds to get hold before the other has done more than put his bill above water, and to obtain and make off with the prize, (precious part, the root and all,) but generally he contents himself with swimming about among the industrious divers, and devouring their leavings, the grassy part of the plant. The favorite pasture ground of the canvass back on the Potomac is between Crane and Mason's Islands, the first about twenty-five miles below Washington, and the latter within the District of Columbia opposite to George Town.* * When this part of the river is congealed, usually in January, they are driven by the ice lower down, to the brackish or salt water, and return on its dissolution towards spring, but never in such condition, or with such good flavor; nor do they recover these after such an absence, during that season. "Of late years, because of the increase of hunters constantly in the pursuit, and the quantity of craft flying, they have been in a great measure driven from the upper beds of their favorite food, and are seldom, but in small numbers, seen above the bridge, across the river at Washington. But a little lower down, and where the river becomes wider, when at rest at night, or when they have retired from feeding during the day, they ride in the midst of it in such numbers as literally to cover acres of water. When they resort to the flats for feeding, they separate in a degree, but yet are found thus employed in flocks of many hundreds, and sometimes thousands. Until within the last five and twenty years, this game was obtained in no other way than by shots from the land, and it was therefore, an object of great interest and sport with the amateurgunners. "The positions opposite to their feeding places were known, slight blinds of brush wood were thrown up on the edges of the banks, previous to their arrival in the fall, of four or five feet height, under cover of which, in a stooping posture, the sportsman can reach the desired point undiscovered by the sight, (for it happens that this bird is not like some of its tribe, as the malard and others, armed with a strong sense of smell) and here posted, if one of skill and patience in his vocation, he waits often no inconsiderable time for the proper occasion to give the greater effect to his fire. Sometimes when the tide makes higher deepening the water near the bank, and so inducing the ducks to run closer in, but most generally foregoing fair opportunities during every few minutes, to fire on detached parties, small in number, until a good portion of the flock has placed itself well huddled together, in the desired position. The habit of these ducks, which, as we have said, are most expert divers, is when feeding in flocks near the bank, to take their course across the shoal from the outer to the inner part of it, beginning on the outer part where the water is deepest, and progressing inwards with great bustle and activity, each darting down head foremost with much velocity, and presently returning to the surface with the sought morsel in its bill, despatching this, and repeating incessantly the operation presenting a constant and rapid succession of comers up and goers down, without order, and amidst a great splashing of water, until they find they have approached the inmost edge of the growth of grass, when suddenly they all rise in succession to the surface, those first up waiting a moment for the last to come, and now the whole flock being above water, and exhibiting three times the number it before seemed, with one accord, they fall in to close order, wheel and swim slowly along, in a direction parallel for some two or three hundred feet with the bank, as well to recover from their fatigue, as to place the column over ground, not yet foraged; and this done, facing outward, they re-commence their work of diving and feeding, now moving toward the outer edge of the shoal. "It is at this critical moment at the proper stage of the wheeling motion, that the sportsman in ambush, seeks to open on his unsuspecting victims the deadly fire; it is when with elevated heads and the greater part of the body out of the water, the ducks huddled in contact, have presented their sides to him, that he directs his sight and draws his trigger on that section of the flock, which, from its position, best suits his object. In sportsman's phrase, "when he has got the eye, can ruffle the feather and string," in other words, when the game is so near that their eyes can be seen, and in such position that the shot may not glance off on the feathers, and that they can be raked by the fire; the proper observation of which rules often gives it more than double the effect. To gain and combine all these advantages, only belongs to the practised and patient sportsman; he must be acquainted with the habits of his game, and altho' they pass often in review very near him, in the foraging process just described, he must lie close, and often endure cold and wet for a considerable time, and to make his shot tell well, resist temptation, until in its various manœuvres, the flock puts itself most in his power; frequently during the ambuscade, the wary flock takes alarm from some movement of the real, or a supposed enemy, and fly suddenly off, at other times, in a sense of danger, not so confirmed, it scatters and swims difectly from the land with great rapidity, each duck as it emerges, dropping the fruit of its dive, and taking in haste the same track; an inexperienced gunner believing his chance gone of doing better fires on them in this state, before they get out of his reach, but does little execution. Not so with the old sportsman, he reserves his fire, well knowing that if he remains covered, or when other cause of apprehension, as of some person accidentally appearing, shall cease or have passed away, the flock will, after reconnoitering at a distance for a while, return again to its feeding ground, and particularly will this last, so determine, because he is fully aware of the fact, that this swimming retreat is always performed under the signal of sauve qui peut, and the double precaution of each, separating as widely as possible from the other, and sinking itself so far under the water that nothing but the head and part of the neck remains as a mark. "There is a singular device practised too, by sportsmen, for shooting the canvass back, as well as the other ducks, denominated drift fowl, in the Potomac,—the red head and black head shoveler, and also the swan, from the banks; it is called tolling them in, and there can be no question of the fact, that each of this description of water fowl are often brought within gun shot, by an artifice practised on some propensity with them, not easily accounted for. It is sometimes done by means of a dog, trained for the purpose, and sometimes by moving or shaking in a particular way, the branch of a tree with the dried leaves yet attached, a colored handkerchief or some similar thing, the color, however, in each case, being of a reddish or yellowish hue; and an instance of a hunter yet living on the banks of the Potomac, who has a thick head of red hair, that he wears in a large old fashioned queue, with a long square brush at the end, often using this brush, shaken by one hand when lying in wait, with the rest of his body concealed, as a decoy to toll in ducks, has been given us from good authority. "The Swan is only tolled by a dog, that is taught to play about within easy call of his master, at the edge of the water, the several species of ducks just enumerated, are to be tolled by the dog in that way, or by the other device. In all cases the hunter contrives to place himself behind a log or some other cover well concealed, before he begins his operations, taking care to observe that the direction of the wind is not unfavorable to him, and that the flock he means to toll is near enough to distinguish such objects on the shore, and under no alarm at the time. By what motive these fowls are influenced, we have not heard satisfactorily explained; but certain it is, they are very commonly brought in from some hundreds of yards distance, in this way, to within 62 point blanket shot. It is said, and perhaps truly, in the case of the dog, that they fancy themselves in pursuit of some animal, as the fox, or mink, by which their young are annoyed at their breeding places. "Of late years, however, these sports enjoyed by the inhabitants of the banks of the river, have been very much interrupted, by the practice of shooting from skiffs, with long guns of large calibre, by that class of gunners, who hunt for the market. They use a very light small skiff made quite sharp at the bows, capable of taking only one man and his enormous gun, so low that when thus laden, the gun-wales are within two inches of the surface, and painted of the color of the water; in the bottom of this skiff, scarcely wider than his body, the man lays prostrate, his face downwards, his gun fixed on a double swivel, to the bow-piece, muzzle out, and the breach being close by his head, so fixed with an arm over each side, and grasping a short paddle in either hand, when within a certain distance of the flock, he bears down on it so slowly and regularly, and keeping the little bark in such direction, that from its very small elevation above the level of the water, and the sharpness of the bow always presented toward the flock, he often succeeds in the day, and always in the night time, to arrive within good distance for such a piece as he uses, which is very long, and so heavy as not to be fited by the usual method of bringing to the shoulder, and with four or five times the charge of a common fowling piece, he commits great slaughter. Most of this mischief, if mischief it be, is done in the night, among the flocks in the middle of the wide part of the river, where they retire for rest, and are found riding asleep with their heads under their wings; and mischief we can but think it, since it is believed that the numbers of the canvass back duck have sensibly decreased since the practice was introduced, and we can but join in the opinion, that this terrible destruction of them at their resting places in the night, where not only are great numbers killed, but very many are wounded and escape in the dark, for the time, only to linger and die, must ultimately drive off the whole tribe to some place of greater safety, if not offering such grateful food. The other drift fowl of this river have much the habits of, and are hunted somewhat as are the canvass back. There is nothing remarkable either in the habits or the manner of taking the rest of the wild fowl, we have enumerated and not particularly described. "Sora.—There is yet, however, one other description of water fowl frequenting the Pomac, although, of smaller size, less than the snipe, yet affording so great a delicacy for the table, and so much amusement to the sportsman, that we must not omit to notice it. It is the Sora of Virginia, and Rail of Pennsylvania, sometimes called improperly, Ortolan in the middle states. It frequents the tide water marshes of the fresh water of this river, and is here only for a few weeks, arriving early in September, and departing toward the latter end of October. It is common also we learn, on the Delaware, and the Schuylkill, the James river and most of the rivers in the middle and southern states. The natural history of this bird has baffled the efforts of the most diligent and acute enquiries on such subjects, it is not known which are its breeding places, whence it comes to, or whither it goes from us. It is only certain, that it appears suddenly in great numbers, comes lean, soon gets very fat on the seed of the wild oat, which constitutes its principal and favorite food in these waters,—and disappears, on the approach of the first smart frost, all at once, as it would seem in a single night,—no person can give evidence of the manner or direction, of its arrival or departure; but it is notorious among sportsmen and others, that they may be found in great numbers and affording fine sport, on a given day in the fall, when if a night of smart frost intervenes, on the next day, not one is to be found, nor another seen until the return of their time of visit on the next year. And what makes this the more remarkable is, that they seem badly provided as a bird of passage, having short wings and flying heavily, and not being in the habit, while here, of congregating; some conjecture that they plunge into the mud, and lie in a torpid state all the rest of the year, but this, like the story of the immer ion of the swallow, is scarcely credible. Wilson supposes them to be migratory— that they have, when it is necessary to exert it, greater power on the wing than is attributed to them generally, and that they come here from a more northern, and pass on to a more southern climate which seems to be most probable. "They afford fine sport to the gunner without the necessity of much fatigue or address, they are generally shot on the wing, and as they fiy slowly they are easily brought down with a light charge of small shot. The time of the tide must be obseryed—the gunner in a light skiff, pushed with a pole, by a man in the stern, goes into the marsh on the rise of the tide, an hour or two before high water, and has to leave it the same time on the ebb, not only that he may have a sufficient depth to float his skiff over the flats and fallen grass, but because the birds dont rise as freely on alarm, when by the absence of water they can escape on foot, by running ever the mud, and hiding themselves among the grass, at which they are very adroit. At a favorable tide, and when the birds are plenty, there is busy work for 3 or 4 hours for the gunner; he may fire almost as fast as he can load, always, however, at single birds; for although hundreds are often all round him, and springing at every moment within gun shot, even two are rarely seen together. In the marshes on the upper part of the Eastern Branch, and within a few miles of Washington, this game is very plenty, and affords much amusement to the sportsmen every fall. Lower down the Potomac they have another mode of taking the Sora, with less cost, and more expeditiously, much practised on the gentlemen's estates in that quarter. It is done in the night by means of a light. A canoe is prepared before hand, by placing across the gunwales amid ships, a few boards constituting a platform, of about 3 feet square; this is covered with clay, to the thickness of two or three inches, and when dry, affords a good hearth; a quantity of light wood, so called, (the heart of the yellow pine, which after lying falles in the woods until the sap part is decayed, and having concentrated its resinous matter, burns fiercely) is split into small pieces, and thrown into the bottom of the canoe near the hearth, and a boy posted by it to keep up the fire: two or three men now embark, provided, one with a stout common pole to push the canoe, and the others with light poles 12 or 15 feet long, having a flat board 5 or 6 inches broad, and a foot or so long, nailed on at one end; and enter the marshes frequented by these birds on a dark night, at a time of the tide, when pretty well covered with water, the Sora are found perched upon the long stalks of the reeds and wild oats, to get out of its way. The blazing fire throws such a glare of light, all around for twenty or thirty paces, that it not only discovers quite plainly the birds to those at the fire, but it so decoys or stupifies them as to detain them in their positions, peeping and peering at the light, until they are approached within striking distance with the flattened poles, and knocked on the head one by one; thirty or forty dozen are sometimes killed in this way by the crew of one canoe on a single tide." GEORGETOWN. Georgetown is a Port of Entry and Post Town in Washington county. It was originally laid out under an act of the Colonial Assembly of Maryland, passed in May 15th, 1751. In 1789 the town was incorporated, and is under the government of a mayor, recorder, alderman and common council. This town is situated on the left bank of the Potomac river, at the head of tide water and the natural navigation of that river, and is separated by Rock creek from Washington, with which there is a ready communication at present by means of two bridges crossing the creek at two principal streets of Georgetown, and an additional means of communication by a pier, of the width of 160 feet, lately constructed across the mouth of Rock creek. The town is remarkably salubrious, and it has at all times escaped those summer epidemics that have prevailed some years in the adjacent country. It is handsomely situated on a succession of hills, rising gradually from the river and creek, to which all its streets incline. So that every considerable rain thoroughly cleanses them of all impurity. For some years after the late war, a very active business was transacted in the town, and the improvements during this time were very numerous and ornamental. Subsequently, and until within the last two or three years, its trade has declined, and improvement been in a great measure suspended; within this period, however, there has been a very considerable progressive amendment in trade, and numerous valuable buildings, and other improvements are now in progress, or have been recently completed. Its principal export trade consists of tobacco, flour, leather, soap, candles, beer, &amp;c. The annual inspection of tobacco, has recently amounted to 5,000 hogsheads; the inspection of flour to more than 80,000 barrels. There is a considerable foreign trade with Europe, South America and the West Indies. Internal Improvements.— The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal passes through the heart of the town, at the level of thirty-seven feet above the river, and is let into an extensive basin, formed from Rock creek by four detached locks. Being the highest seaport on the Potomac, and the first reached by the canal in its descent, its situation is peculiarly favorable for enjoying the trade which is wafted on that great high way, and which establishes a ready communication from a rich back country, to the basin at Rock creek. "The Locks are almost all of 8 feet lift—are built of cut stone, and laid in the best hydraulic cement. "The canal from the head of Little Falls, 5 miles above Georgetown, receives water from the Potomac river; and the river being at that point, raised by a dam across it, of 4 feet in height above the surface. This level of water is brought down to Congress street in the heart of Georgetown, and is there 37 feet above low-water of the Potomac; on the east side of Congress street there is a Lock, and at the tail of the Lock on Jefferson street, a bridge; below Jefferson street a second Lock and bridge, to pass Washington street; below Washington street, a third Lock and bridge at the foot of it, to pass Green, street; and below Green street a fourth Lock, to let down into the basin of Rock creek. "The plan of the Basin at Rock creek is one of the most important of the details of the whole project, and nature seems to have placed Rock creek at a point calculated by this improvement to be invaluable. "By the project of forming a mole or dam across the mouth of Rock creek, the outer part of which is along the side of the channel of the Potomac, where there is from 9 to 12 feet water at low tide. This mole is 1200 feet long, and 160 feet wide, made of stone on both sides, and filled between with earth taken from the Canal, as it passes through Georgetown. "This mole is intended to raise the water of Rock creek 3 feet above common high tide in the Potomac, and retain it uniformly at this height. About the middle of the mole there is a Lock to let down boats into the river, and this Lock has a lift of only 3 feet at high tide, and 6 feet at low tide. This Lock with the form previously named, brings the boats into the Potomac river. "By the side of the Lock which lets into the Potomac, there is a waste weir 200 feet long, over which the surplus water of Rock creek passes. "This mole or dam flows the water of Rock creek back about three quarters of a mile, and makes a beautiful basin from 100 to 250 feet wide, which has a depth of 6 feet water in nearly the whole distance, and gives on the Washington and Georgetown sides of Rock creek, the greatest possible advantages for wharves and ware-houses, which can be imagined. It appears that nature never formed a more convenient and useful spot, to end a great and important work of this kind, than Rock creek, with these improvements upon it. And we do not see any place where a useful and capacious basin could have been formed, which would have accommodated the trade with so great facility and economy, any where in the neighborhoods of Georgetown or Washington. "The route of the Capal passes very direct (almost straight) through Georgetown; and the cutting is generally only what is wanted. It is true that between Potomac street and High street, there is a short space of 300 feet, where it was found necessary to cut 30 feet, in one place 32 feet. All this earth is deposited to form the mole or pier; this is the deepest cutting or excavation on any part of the Canal. "After leaving the streets in Georgetown, the Canal runs along the steep bank of the Potomac for a mile and a half, the greater part very steep, formed of rock, which required blasting with powder; above this last distance the country assumes a little more gentle declivity and better shape for a Canal, and it passes along sloping ground, till it intersects the old Potomac Canal, and following that to near the western end, it then leaves it and rises to a higher level by a Lock of 8 feet lift, and soon after, another of the same lift, and then it passes on for one and a half miles, and then a Lock of 8 feet lift; then one and a half miles and then another Lock; then half a mile, and then commences a succession of 6 Locks, at intervals or spaces of 100 yards between each; then commences a long level of more than 4 miles without a Lock. This brings you to the Great Falls, where are 6 Locks more, at intervals or spaces of 100 to 200 yards between. We then reach the head of the Great Falls, and have ascended 20 Locks, or 160 feet from Rock creek. This part of the Canal about the Great Falls presents features in the formation of the country, which are very striking and bold; and nature has done a good deal by forming a ravine of nearly a mile in length, with huge ledges of large blocks of granite or gneiss, forming its sides, and where the water will be from 10 to 30 feet deep, &amp; 100 to 200 feet wide. Along this we pass, and a towing path is formed by levelling some, and raising other parts so as to make the path regular on the side of it; at another part of the Canal there are vertical walls to sustain the Canal 50 feet high among the rocks. "To those who have but a limited knowledge of the duties of a Civil Engineer, it has been objected that the plan of cutting so deep through Georgetown was wrong. It is however, believed, that the plan presents many advantages. 1st. It enables the Canal to pass through Georgetown with less inconvenience to private property than any other route, and a great deal cheaper. 2d. It furnishes an easy pass way by bridges over the Canal, nearly or quite level with the streets, thereby not incommoding the buildings along the streets, nor making the ascent of the streets (which are now considerable) any steeper. 3d. It furnished the earth to make a mole or pier of great width, and capable of receiving warehouses in the centre of it, where boats can discharge at one end of the warehouse, and ships take in at the other. This furnishes a plan for transhipment of property with the least possible expense. 4th. By making this basin at Rock creek, it presents shores where boats can lay in safety for one and a half miles on both its sides. It also finds a place in its upper part, where boats not in immediate use, can lay without paying much wharfage or expense, and be perfectly safe." Manufacturing Facilities, Public Institutions, &amp;c.—The vicinity of the town naturally offers peculiar advantages for extensive manufactories. The river falling near 40 feet in 4 miles. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal extending over this space at an elevation of 37 feet above tide water, and of a width of 70 to 80 feet, with a depth of 7 ft. may supply very numerous manufacturing establishments with water, without obstruction to the navigation. The public institutions and buildings consist of the Georgetown College; a society of Nuns incorporated by Congress, under the name of "The Sisters of the Visitation," who conduct a very flourishing female academy. There are 8 houses of public worship, 2 Roman Catholic, 2 Episcopalian, 1 Presbyterian, 2 Methodist and 1 African,—also 2 banks incorporated by Congress, the Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank of Georgetown, and Union Bank, with a joint capital of $9,64,130. It contains also a considerable number of dry good and grocery stores, 1 extensive brewery with several manufactories, and every mechanical pursuit necessary to a town of its magnitude, and immediately above the town is an extensive cannon foundry. The academy under the direction of "The Sisters of Visitation," has been established 33 years, and averages generally from 70 to 80 young ladies as boarders, and from 30 to 40 young ladies as day scholars. Within the nunnery enclosure, but detached from the academy and approached from a different street, there are upward of 400 young girls taught gratuitously, about 200 attending daily. At the Lancaster School, there are annually taught about 100 boys, and 70 girls. There are 3 other academies for young ladies, in which are taught all the branches of polite and fashionable education, and 3 academies for young men, with several other respectable schools all conducted by competent teachers.

It is the seat of Gen. John Mason. It has a highly cultivated surface of about 70 acres,—the natural soil, light and sandy. A causway on the Virginia side, and a horse boat ferry from Georgetown, facilitates communication with this beautiful spot from the shores. The highest ground above the level of the river is elevated about 50 feet, and upon this eminence the dwelling is situated. The usual tides rise about 3 feet. In digging for water, it is procured at the depth of 20 or 30 feet from the surface. Agatized wood has been discovered in well digging. The house which is approached through a fine avenue of trees, is extensive, with a number of convenient buildings attached from it the public buildings in Washington are seen to advantage. On the N. side of the Island an alluvial meadow is rapidly forming. The S. side is substantially walled, and dotted with neat white cottages for servants buildings. Warden justly remarks, that "the view from this spot is delightful. It embraces the picturesque banks of the Potomac a portion of the city, and a noble expanse of water. Numerous vessels ply backwards and forwards to animate the scene. Georgetown College.—This College which is pleasantly situated on the northern bank of the Potomac, commands a full view of Georgetown, Washington, the Potomac, and a great part of the District. Its situation is peculiarly healthy. It is under the direction of the incorporated Catholic clergy of Maryland, and is the oldest Catholic seminary in the United States: it was first incorporated in 1799; and in 1815, it received an extension of its privileges from Congress, and was authorized to confer degrees. The college library contains 12,000 volumes. The academic or college year commences on the 15th of September, and ends on the 31st of July; and commencement is near the last of July. The number of students is usually about 140 or 150; a considerable part of them being day scholars. The number of graduates is not great. The number graduated at the commencement of July 25, 1833 was 7.—There are 19 professors and tutors, of whom 3 are professors of theology. The course of ordinary studies is completed in 7 years, at the end of which, if the student has made sufficient progress, he may receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts. When a scholar presents himself to be received into the College, he is examined by the prefect of studies, and placed in that class, for which his prior acquirements may have fitted him, he then passes on in regular succession to the final class of Logic and Moral Philosophy. If he remain longer, and study the higher branches of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy, he may take the degree of Master of Arts. Rules, Regulations and Course of Instruction.—1st. In the lowest school or class of Rudiments, the scholars study the English and French Grammars, Caligraphy, Arithmetic, &amp;c.—and at the conclusion of this year (for each class, unless some student by their particular application and talents, should merit promotion, occupies one year) they are supposed to be able to read and write English correctly. 2d. During the next year, (third class of Humanities,) the scholars continue to study the English and French Grammars, and begin to compose in those languages—Arithmetic is continued and towards the end of the year they commence the Latin Grammar. 3d. In the second class of Humanities, they continue English and French composition, (these studies are continued till the end of Rhetoric.) and Arithmetic: they begin Latin exercises and read some easy Latin authors—as Nepos, Cæsar, &amp;c. During this year a course of Geography is studied, and Greek is begun. 4th. In the first class of Humanities, they read portions of Sallust, Cicero's minor works, and some of Ovid's Elegies, Prosody—and commence History. They study portions of the Greek Scripture, Xenophon, and Lucian's dialogues. Algebra is begun. 5th. In Poetry, Cicero's minor works, Virgil, Horace, Livy and Homer, are read. History is continued and a treatise of Mythology learned Mathematics continued. 6th. In Rethoric—The scholars study Rhetoric, Cicero's Orations, Homer, Virgil, Horace, History and Mathematics. 7th. This year a course of Logic and Moral Philosophy is studied— Mathematics continued. During the whole course, great attention is paid to Composition, particularly English. There will always be a class of Book-keeping for the convenience of those who wish to learn it. The Italian, Spanish and German languages will be also taught if required. Music, Drawing, Dancing, &amp;c. will form additional charges. The College possesses a select Library of about 12,000 volumes, the use of which is granted to the senior students without any additional charge. There are two examinations in the year. The minor one in February or March, and the other immediately before the commencement, which will always be a day of public exercises, towards the end of July. No student is admitted, who cannot read and has not a good moral character. As the members of the College profess the Catholic Religion, the exercises of Religious worship are Catholic, but members of other Religious denominations are received, of whom it is only required, that they respectfully assist at the public duties of religion with their companions. Were not this enforced, no proper order, such as should be found in large literary institutions, could exist in the College. No student, will be permitted to leave the College on visits of any length oftener than once a year, viz: at the great vacation. If his parents live in the District, he will be allowed to visit them once a month, but not oftener—and he must then always return to the College before night. Terms.—Every student shall pay on entering the College, ten dollars. He shall bring a mattrass, a pillow, two pillow cases, two pair of sheets, four blankets and a counterpane, or pay $6 per annum for the use of bed and bedding. He must also bring with him one suit of clothes, as a uniform—which is in winter, a blue cloth coat and pantaloons with a black velvet waistcoat; in summer, white pantaloons with a black silk waistcoat are used. He must likewise bring with him two suits for daily wear, for which no particular color is prescribed; six shirts, six pair of stockings, six pocket handkerchiefs, three pair of shoes, a hat and a cloak or great coat, also a silver spoon. These articles if not brought by the student will be furnished by the College and included in the first bill. The pension for board, washing, mending and mending materials— use of books, (philosophical and mathematical excepted,) pens, ink and writing paper, slates and pencils is $150. Medical aid and medicine, unless parents choose to run the risk of a Doctor's bill in case of sickness, $3 per annum. All chargest must be paid half yearly in advance. For the convenience of parents, particularly those at a distance, the College will undertake to supply the students with clothing. The annual expense cannot be specified, as it depends upon the age and wearing of the student all that can be said, is the strictest economy and simplicity will be observed. If parents wish the College to supply their children with clothes, a deposit is required by the College equivalent to the probable expense of clothing for six months. With regard to pocket money, it is desired that all the students should be placed on an equality, and that it should not exceed 12½ cents per week; and whatever is allowed must be deposited in the hands of the directors of the College. Half-boarders are received on the usual terms, viz. $5 entrance, and $65 for board per annum. Day scholars, $5 for fuel and servants, as no charge is made for tuition. Convent.—The Convent of the Sisters of Visitation, is a plain, substantial, but gloomy-looking, monastic institution, which must recall, amidst its solitudes, to the recollection of the contemplative mind, the touching story of Abelard and Eloisa.— The solemnity of the scene is in strict keeping with the object of the edifice. The visiter is admitted into the speaking room, as it is called, which is separated from the sanctum sanctorum, by substantial wooden bars, resembling the grates of a prison. The Sisters are clad in sable garments, with deep black hoods, and white veils descending to the waist. The Nuns are from various States of the Union, and generally number about 50. The process of initiation is the same as the other nunneries, the novitiate being two years, the first for the white veil, and the second for the black, after which, there can be no retreat. WASHINGTON CITY. Washington City, the seat of the General Government of the U. S. of America, and capital of the District of Columbia, is situated on the left or Maryland side of the Potomac, near the head of tide water, and by the river and Chesapeake bay, 290 ms. from the Atlantic. It is 38 ms. S. W. from Baltimore, 136 from Philadelphia, 225 from New York, 432 from Boston, 595 from Augusta, Maine, 546 from Detroit, Michigan, 1,068 from Little Rock, Arkansas, 856 from St. Louis, 1,203 from New Orleans, 662 from Savannah, Georgia, and 544 from Charleston, S. C. The capitol stands in lat. 38° 52′ 45″; long. W. from the observatory at Greenwich 76° 5 30″, and is located at the junction of the rivers Potomac 63 and Eastern branch, extending nearly 4 ms. up each, and including a tract of territory, exceeded in point of convenience, salubrity and beauty by none in America. For although the land in general appears level, yet by gentle and gradual swellings, a variety of elegant prospects are produced, and sufficient descent formed for conveying off the water occasioned by rain. Within the limits of the city are a great number of excellent springs,—water of the best quality may readily be had, and the never failing streams that run through that territory, are also collected for the use of the city. The waters of Reedy branch and of Tiber creek, may be conveyed to the President's house. The source of Tiber creek is elevated 236 ft. above the level of its tide water. The perpendicular height of the ground on which the Capitol stands is 78 ft. above the level of the tide in Tiber creek,—the waters of Tiber creek may therefore be conveyed to the Capitol, and after watering that part of the city may be destined to other useful purposes. The Eastern branch is one of the safest and most commodious harbors in America, and is sufficiently deep for the largest Ships, for about 4 ms. above its mouth, while the channel lies close along the hank adjoining the city, and affords a large and convenient harbor. The Potomac although only navigable for small craft for a considerable distance from its banks, next to the city, (excepting about half a mile above the junction of the river,) will, nevertheless afford a capacious summer harbor, as an immense number of Ships may ride in the great channel opposite and below the city. The situation of this metropolis, is upon the great line of communication, about equi-distant from the northern and southern extremities of the Union, and nearly so from the Atlantic and Pittsburg; upon the best navigation, and in the midst of a commercial territory, probably the richest, and commanding the most extensive internal resources of any in America, to recommend it as an eligible place for the permanent seat of the General Government; and it has grown up with an extraordinary degree of rapidity. But its growth is rather to be attributed to the vast amount expended in it by the Federal Government, and the numerous strangers brought thither, than to its commercial advantages, great as they are.— The city of Baltimore being so near it, and having such immense advantages in the greater capital enterprise and skill of her merchants, in contiguity to the ocean, and greater facility of approach in her greater age and established commercial character and intercourse,—and lastly in being a city of a state with a much more extended territory all the advantages, of which that state naturally desires to pour into her lap,—and that identical territory too, being the very source from which the materials of commerce would have to be drawn by Washington,—the latter can never hope to rival the former in her commercial prosperity. The city of Washington has also to compete with the town of Georgetown, Alexandria and Fredericksburg, much of the commerce of which would flow to her if those towns did not exist. The fact, however, that Washington is not likely ever to be an overgrown commercial city, is not at all to be regretted by the statesman. The legislation of the Union would not be at all benefitted by the presence of a noisy, disorderly mob,—which is almost sure to exist in a large commercial city. The plan of this city appears to contain some important improvements upon that of the best planned cities in the world, combining in a remarkable degree, convenience, regularity, elegance of prospect, and a free circu- lation of air. The position for the different public edifices, and for the several squares, and areas of different shapes, as they are laid down, were first fixed on the most advantageous ground commanding the most extensive prospect, and from their situation susceptible of such improvement as either use or ornament might at any time require. The soil is generally sterile, mixed with pebbles and sand, the length of the city from S. E. to N. W. is 4¼ ms.; mean width 2½, containing a fraction less than 8¼ sq. ms. The city was laid out under the supervision of General Washington (then President of the United States) in 1791. The principal streets are called avenues, and named after the different states of the Union. These diverge from the Capital and President's house, and a direct line of communication between these two edifices is formed by Pennsylvania avenue, the principal and finest street of the city. The avenues are crossed by streets running N. and S. alphabetically arranged, and others running E. and W. numerically arranged. Many of these are shaded, and all of them very broad,— the former being from 120 to 160 feet in width, and the latter from 70 to 110. The City is divided into six wards, the following table gives a correct statement of the census, assessments, and valuations of each, up to December 31, 1830. Agreeably to the last census. WARDS.

The total number of buildings in 1831 was, 3,560,—of these there were public 65—dwellings, 3,233, and 262 shops and warehouses. In the stores, and particularly on the Pennsylvania avenue, there is a great variety, well supplied, containing every description of dry goods, groceries, hardware, china, glass, drugs, millinery, confectionery, fruit, clothing, hats, shoes, boots, books, stationery, leather, chairs, plate, jewellery, in short, every article of necessity or ornament. The Mechanic Arts.—The printing business, by the agency of steam and hand labor, alone employs during the winter season about 300 hands. There are four daily papers extensively circulated; also 4 weekly, circulated extensively. Book-binding, engraving, cabinet making, tobacco, manufacturing, hatting, saddlery, shoe and boot making, tailoring, coach making, blacksmith's work, gun smiths, &amp;c. are extensively carried on and employ a number of workmen. Not less than 8 or 9 millions of bricks are made annually, employing nearly 200 hands in the warm weather. Bricklayers, carpenters, painters, glaziers, and in short, every mechanic connected with the erection of buildings, are extensively engaged in the summer season. The population of Washington has increased rapidly, and from its being the seat of the government of the county and its salubrious and healthy location, it must continue to augment in number. In 1800 its population was 3,210; in 1803, 4,352; in 1807, 5,652; in 1810, 8,208; in 1817, 11,299; in 1820, 13,246; and in 1830, 18,827, consisting of. White Persons. Free Colored. Slaves. Total.

Among these the first in rank is the Capitol,—it stands on a most beautiful eminence, commanding a complete view of every part of the City, and a considerable part of the country around, with the Potomac, as far as Alexandria.—It is of the Corinthian order, and the most magnificent edifice in the U. States. It is situated near the western extremity of the Capitol square; it is built of free stone, and composed of a central edifice and two wings, and is of the following dimensions, viz: Fe. Inches. Length of front, 350 5 Depth of wings, 121 6 Eastern projection, 65 Western projection, 85 Height of wings to top of balustrade, 70 Central Dome, 120 Length of Representatives' Hall, 96 Height of Representatives' Hall, 60 Length of Senate Chamber, 74 Height of Senate Chamber, 42 Height of Rotunda, 96 Diameter of Rotunda, 96 The Representatives' Hall is in the second story of the south wings and is semicircular in form. The dome and galleries of the Hall, are supported by pillars of variegated marble from the banks of the Potomac. This apartment is truly magnificent. In front of the Speaker's chair, and over the entrance into the Chamber, stands an allegorical figure, —formed of Italian marble, representing History in the act of recording the proceedings of the nation. She stands on a winged car, which seems to roll over a section of the tetrestrial globe, exhibiting in basso relievo the signs of the zodiac. The wheel of the car is intended as the face of a clock, which is to be placed behind, and the front contains in basso relieve a figure of Fame, and a profile bust of Washington. Above the Speaker's chair, is a colossal figure of Liberty, in plaster, pointing to the Hall below, and supported on the right by an American Eagle— and on the left by the Roman fasces, which are partially enveloped in the folds of a serpent. Immediately under this figure, on the frize is carved in alto relievo another Eagle in the attitude of flying. The Senate Chamber in the north wing is of the same semi-circular form, a screen of Ionic columns, with capitols after those of the temple of Minerva Polias, supports a gallery to the east, and forms a lobby below,—and a new gallery of iron pillars and railings, of a light and elegant structure, projects from the curved walls,—the dome ceiling is enriched with square caissons of stucco. The intervals between the marble pilasters in the wall are covered with straw-colored drapery. Columns of Potomac marble, support the eastern gallery. The Rotunda occupies the centre. This is the principal entrance from the east Portico and west Stair, and leads to the legislative halls and library, which contains 16,000 volumes. This room is divided in its circuit into pannels, by lofty Grecian pilasters, which support a bold enlablature, ornamented with a wreath of olive.—A hemispherical dome rises above, filled with large plan caissons, like those of the Pantheon at Rome. The pannels of the circular walls are appropriated to paintings and basso relievos of historical subjects. This noble edifice was not quite completed when the British army under Gen. Ross, (who was afterwards slain in battle near Baltimore) in August, 1814, made a sudden incursion, after defeating the American troops at Bladensburg, gained possession of the City, setting fire to the Capitol, President's house, public offices, &amp;c. reducing the whole to ashes, together with the valuable library of Congress. The foundation of the north wing was laid in the presence of Gen. Washington on the 18th of Sept. 1923, and finished in 1800,—cost $480,262 57.—South wing commenced in 1803, and finished in 1808,—cost $308,808 41,—and the centre, on the 24th of May, 1818, being the anniversary of its destruction by the British, and finished in 1827—cost $957,647 35. The building covers an acre and a half, or 1820 square feet, exclusive of its enclosure for fuel; and an elegant area and glacis on the west front. The square contains 22½ acres, embracing a circumference of three-fourths of a mile, and 185 feet, enclosed by a substantial iron railing with very neat gate-ways. Gravel walks, and beautiful borders of shrubbery and flowers, forming a delightful promenade for the use of the citizens. Opposite to the west front is the botanic garden ground, a situation well adapted for the purpose, which it is supposed will be placed under the care of the Columbian Institute. "At the west front of the Capitol is placed the beautiful marble monument (which lately stood in the navy yard) erected by the American officers, to the memory of their brethren who fell before Tripoli in the year 1804. It is a small doric column, with emblematical embellishments, and crowned with an eagle in the act of flying. Its base is sculptured in basso relievos, representing Tripoli,—its fortress,—the Mediterranean and our fleet in the foreground and on each angle stands an appropriate marble figure. The one represents Columbia directing the attention of her children to History, who is recording the daring and intrepid action of the American heroes, —the third represents Fame with a wreath of laurel in one hand and a pen in the other: and the fourth, Mercury, or the God of commerce, with his cornucopia and caduceus. The President's House is two stories high with a lofty basement, a is 180 feet long and 85 wide. To each end there is attached the necessary offices, stables, coal and ice houses, with a colonnade front rising to a level with the main floor of the house the roofs being flat these offices afford a terrace suitable for a promenade. It is built of white free stone.—The building is 170 feet in front and 86 deep, and is crowned with a balus trade; the roof is covered with copper, and the entrance from the north is through a lofty portico, which is projected from the front, so as to leave room for a carriage to pass under between the platform and outer columns. The house stands on an elevation of 44 feet above the usual high water of the river Potomac, in the centre of a large reservation of ground of 20 acres. The front entrance faces north, poan open square; and the garden front to the south, possessing a delightful water prospect, together with a commanding view of the Capitol, and the most important parts of the City. The Virginia and Maryland shores of the river, and Potomac bridge, and of the opposite view to the south, is extremely beautiful and picturesque. It is an elegant building and stands about one and a half miles from the Capitol. The entrance is subdivided into halls, sets of apartments for the accommodation of a large family, and for the reception and entertainment of numerous guests. Liberal provisions have been made by Congress from time to time for furnishing the building in a style appropriate to its elegance and uses to which it is dedicated. There are on the same open area on which the President's house is located, four other buildings, quadrangular in shape, two stories high, built of brick and stuccoed. Of these the two on the east are the Departments of State and the Treasury* * The Treasury building was consumed by fire in the summer of 1833, and has not since been rebuilt, but will soon be commenced. —those on the west, the Departments of War and the Navy. The General Post Office is on Pennsylvania Avenue, and the Patent Office is kept in the same building. * * The Treasury building was consumed by fire in the summer of 1833, and has not since been rebuilt, but will soon be commenced. The City Hall is not yet completed, but the plan is that of a noble structure. Its front is 200 feet,—the elevation of the north front 72 feet,— its Rotunda is 66 feet in diameter,— and Courtroom 70 by 40. There is a Masonic Hall which is a handsome edifice, lately erected near the City Hall. There are also four well supplied market-houses,—an infirmary,—a female orphan asylum,—a jail,—a theatre,—5 extensive hotels,—a foundry, —several breweries,—a museum and City Library. There is a Penitentiary provided for the use of the District, which is under the following rules and regulations. Of the reception and discharge of convicts. "1st.

The Columbian College,— founded by the Baptists, and incorporated by Congress in 1821, went into operation in 1822. It has an elevated and pleasant situation to the north of the city, one mile from the President's house, and two and a half miles from the Capitol. Its buildings consist of a College edifice of 4 stories, 117 feet by 46, having 48 rooms for students, a chapel, &amp;c.; another edifice of the same dimensions is erected, and connected with the first by a building of one story, 80 feet by 40, designed for a refrectory; a philosophical hall and 2 houses for professors. The College has a good philosophical apparatus and library of 4000 volumes. The only public aid which it has received was a grant from Congress of $25,000. The following is the course of study.

The higher Classes are admitted to courses of Lectures on Natural Philosophy, Anatomy and Physiology, Chemistry, Botany Moral and Intellectual Philosophy. The College year is divided into two sessions, of about five months each; the first, from the second Wednesday of January, to the first Wednesday of June, when the summer vacation of two months occurs: the second, from the first Wednesday of August, to the third Wednesday of December, when the annual commencement takes place, and the winter vacation of one month begins. On occasions of great interest, the students are permitted to hear the arguments in the Supreme Court of the United States, and the debates in Congress. A preparatory school is connected with the College, in which pupils are fitted for admission to the Freshman, or higher classes, studies, reading, writing, English Grammar, Arithmetic, and Geography. Adams' Latin Grammar, Historia Sacra, Cæsar's Commentaries,—Virgil, Sallust and Cicero's Select Orations, Valpy's Greek Grammar, the Gospels, and Jacobs' Greek Reader. For admission to the Freshman class, a knowledge of these studies, or an equivalent, is required. Geometry, Alegebra and other higher studies, are also pursued in this school. There are also connected with this establishment a medical department, which was organized in 1824, and a large and commodious building has been erected for the use of the Institution, on 10th st. about equi-distant from the Capitol and the President's house. This building is large and commodious, consisting of 3 elevated stories, with a roof peculiarly constructed for the admission of light into all the apartments appropriated to anatomical purposes. On the ground floor is the Lecture Room, Laboratory, &amp;c. of the Professor of Chemistry. The second story contains the rooms, public and private, of the Professors of the Theory and Practice of Medicine and of Materia Medica, and of the Institutes of Medicine and Medical Jurisprudence. In the third is the Anatomical Theatre, together with rooms occupied by the Professors of Anatomy, Surgery and Obstetrics. The theatre is designed from the most approved plans, and is conveniently connected with the rooms situated in the superior part of the building, which are intended for the purpose of Practical Anatomy. In relation to this particular department of the school, care has been taken to provide space, light and security, together with every other specific convenience 64 that may afford to the student facility in prosecuting to advantage this necessary part of his collegiate studies. The Professor of Anatomy has furnished himself with all the Anatomical preparations which are necessary to his course, and with a large collection of valuable drawings, by which the structure, of those minute parts which cannot be fully displayed within the recent or proposed subject, are exhibited to view on a magnified scale. The Professor of Chemistry is in possession of an extensive apparatus, by the aid of which, all the important, experimental illustrations, belonging to his department, are presented to the class. The ticket of each Professor is $15; and all persons who have attended two full Courses, at this School, are entitled to attend succeeding Courses free of expense. The requisites for graduation are similar to those required in the most respectable institutions in the country. The candidate must have studied 3 years under the direction of some regular physician. He must have attended each Professor two full Courses, or he shall have attended one full Course in this School, and one in some other respectable medical institution. He must have entered his name with the Dean as a candidate for graduation, and delivered to him an inaugural dissertation on some medical subject, 30 days before the close of the session. The lectures commences on the 1st Monday in November, and continue till the last of February. The fee for the lectures on each branch, is $15 or 90 for the whole Course;—the matriculating fee $5;—graduating fee $20. The "Columbian Institute," for the promotion of the Arts and Sciences, was formed at Washington in 1816, and incorporated by Congress in 1818. It consists of 5 Classes, viz. Mathematical Science, Physical Science, Moral and Political Sciences, General Literature and the fine arts. The annual meetings are held on the last Saturday in each year. There are 3 Banks,—the Bank of Washington,—capital $479,120,—The Bank of the Metropolis,—capital $500,000, and the Patriatic Bank,—capital $250,000. There are 19 houses of public worship, 3 Catholic, 4 Episcopalian, 3 Methodist, 4 Baptist, 1 Unitarian and 1 Friends', also 2 public free schools, and a great many other well conducted schools, where the usual branches of education are taught, as well as the dead Languages and Mathematics. Schools for young ladies, are also established in various parts of the city; and there is 1 orphan asylum, constituted in 1815, a colonization society (the mother) instituted in 1817; 6 well organized fire companies and a Masonic Lodge. Regular lines of steam-boats ply from Washington to Alexandria, Baltimore, Norfolk, &amp;c., and numerous stages run to other places,—among which are 8 daily coaches to Baltimore. The territory now Washington was formerly a part of Prince George Co. Md. and was ceded to the United States in 1790. In 1800 it became the seat of government, and 1802 was incorporated as a city. In 1812 it was remodelled, and finally chartered in 1815. The government is composed of a Mayor, 12 Aldermen, and a common Council of 18 members; these are elected by the citizens, the latter for 1, and the Mayor and Aldermen for 2 years. The Navy Yard in this city was established and organized by the act of Congress, approved 27th March, 1804. It contains within its limits about 28 acres; and is enclosed by a high brick wall; with an entrance from the north, through an arched gateway, on each side of which are accommodations for the marine officer and guard, attached to the Yard. The buildings for the officers are commodious,—and appropriate, quarters for the Commandant, Master Commandant, Lieutenant, Sailing Master, Surgeon and Boatswain for store houses, shops, &amp;c. and a Navy Store, with a sail loft in the second story; iron store, with a rigging loft in the second story; Commandant's, and other offices; labratory for the preparation of ordinance fixtures and stores, in the second story of which is a beautiful and well arranged armory. An armorer's shop for repairing small arms; an iron foundry; a brass and composition foundry; a chain cable, and caboose shop; an anchor shop, smithery and plumber's shop; a block maker's shop, a saw mill, and rooms for machinery work, &amp;c. 2 timber sheds on arched columns, one with a joiner's shop, and the other with a mould loft in the second story; 2 ship houses over foundations, and ways for buildings and launching ships of any size. All the buildings are large and of substantial construction, and afford every convenience for building and equipping vessels for sea. There is in the Yard a fresh water dock for seasoning timber, &amp;c. For the purposes of the Navy there are some valuable manufactories established in the Yard; and for it generally, are made anchors, chain cables, cabooses, blocks, ordnance fixtures, and stores of every kind; brass and composition castings, &amp;c. To facilitate the operations in the manufacture of these articles, much laborsaving machinery has been erected; the principal of which is a steam engine, computed of 14 horse power, by which there is kept in continual motion 489 feet of shafts, with their ordinary wheels, drums, &amp;c. to the weight of 40 tons, 8 cwt., 1 qr. lbs. By power derived from the operation of the above shafts, a requisite power and motion is conveyed to two saw gates, each capable of receiving and working any number of saws sufficient for converting a log to any dimensions by one passage through the gate. Two hammers for forging anchors, &amp;c. 2 large hydraulic bellows, 2 circular saws, 1 turning and boring lathe, which when required, can be converted into a machine for boring steam engine cylinders; 9 turning lathes, 5 grind stones, 4 drill lathes for boring sheaves, &amp;c. with other machinery, required to facilitate the operations of the several departments in the adjoining buildings. There is also, situated in the S. E. corner of the Yard, a machine for proving rope and chain cables; the mechanical force of which is so powerful, that two men can part a cable suitable for a ship of the largest size. Considerable as a strain must be, sufficient to part a 24 inch cable, (or a strain of 100 tons,) such is the accuracy of the operation of the index, that two ounces thrown into the scale suspended from the end of the lever, will sensibly affect the index, thereby afording an opportunity of calculating the strainon the cable with the greatest precision. About a mile above the Yard is a large powder magazine, and a warehouse for the storage of salt petre, &amp;c. There is generally employed in the Yard for the manufactories, and as laborers, about 200 men; when ships are building or repairing, the number is proportionably increased by the employment of carpenters, caulkers, boat-builders, mast makers, gun carriage makers, sail makers, coopers, &amp;c. The Yard is beautifully situated on the right bank of the Eastern branch; the channel of which affords an easy navigation for small frigates, sloops of war, &amp;c. The United States' Arsenal is situated at the southern extremity of the city, on the point of land formed by the junction of the Potomac and Anacostia rivers. This position, being at the head of ship navigation— at the seat of government—and central in a national point of view, was selected in 1804, as a favorable site for an Arsenal, intended for the manufacture and depository of Military Stores. For these purposes it was exclusively devoted until 1812, when immediately after the declaration of war with England, strong batteries were erected on the sides, approachable by water, both, to protect the Arsenal and guard the river channels leading to the Navy Yard and other parts of the city. From this time, the place was known by the name Fort Washton; notwithstanding its entire want of defence on the land side; which made it necessary, after the British army had entered Washington, for the American troops to vacate it.— This was done during the night of the 24th of August, 1814, after burning the work shops and removing as much property as time would permit. The next morning a detachment of 500 British troops marched to the fort, and commenced the destruction of whatever had been left in a serviceable state. Among other things, were a number of 18 pounder guns, left by the garrison in the haste of departure, mounted in battery and unspiked—these they attempted to destroy by discharging one against the trunnion of another; but, most unfortunately for the operators, the first piece discharged happened to be pointed in the direction of a well near by into which, some of the wadding of the gun was thrown by the discharge; this communicated fire to a large quantity of powder, previously placed there by the garrison to prevent its falling into the hands of the enemy, and a tremendous explosion was the immediate consequence; by which one half of the 500 men, who entered the place 30 minutes before, with all the pride and hilarity resulting from victory, were killed and wounded. Among the killed, was a Captain Frazer, acting Adjutant General of the British army. In the autumn of 1814, the work shops were rebuilt; and the manufacture and preparation of army supplies went on as before. In 1816 a large store house and officers' quarters were erected, forming the north front of the fort. In 1823-24, the garrison was withdrawn—the ramparts removed, and permanent buildings exclusively for Arsenal purposes erected on the same ground, making, with those built in 1816, the four sides of a rectangular parallelogram. According to present arrangements, there are two buildings for the deposite of muskets, rifles, pistols, swords and other small arms, 3 for the dwellings of officers and artificers; and 4 large work shops, besides other smaller buildings. One of the shops contains a steam engine which drives various machines, made use of in repairing small arms, and in manufacturing artillery carriages. Of the latter, a considerable number are annually made at the place—mostly for the use of the militia. The Arsenal contains many thousand arms, consisting of all the usual varieties. They are neatly arranged in open frames, and being kept in perfect order, present an imposing appearance. Forty thousand soldiers can be fully armed and equipped at an hour's notice. On the plain in front of the Arsenal, are 855 pieces of ordnance, including cannon, howitzers and mortars of various calibres.— Among them are seen trophies of the late and revolutionary wars, captured at Bennington, Saratoga, Yorktown and Bridgewater. There is also a cannon, relick of the revolutionary contest, made in Virginia of hammered iron. It bears the name of "Queen of France," which was marked upon it at that period. The geological formation of the Arsenal grounds, does not differ from other parts of the city. From the surface there is an average of 10 feet in depth of ferruginous clay, resting on alternate horizontal strata of sand and gravel, in which are found detached parcels of bog iron ore. The following statement of expenditures, (by the United States) in Washington, to January 1st, 1830, includes the entire expenses of rebuilding the public edifices at Washington, which were destroyed by fire in 1814. The building of jails for Alexandria county and Washington county,—the purchase of a C. H. for Washington county,—the erection of a United States' Penitentiary, and a variety of other items, not chargable to the ales of city lots. Prior to 1816.

W. and N. by Montgomery Co. Md.,—N. E. by Prince George's Co. Md.,—S. E. by the Eastern branch of Potomac, and S. W. by the main stream of Potomac. In form it approaches a parallelogram, 8 ms. in length from S. E. to N. W.; mean breadth 5¼ ms.; area 42 sq. ms. or 42-100ths of the whole district, extending in lat. from 38° 51′, to 38° 58′ nearly, and in long from 0° 6′ 6″ E. to 0° 03′ W. the Capital. The surface of this Co. is very finely diversified by hill and dale. Rock creek enters near the northern angle, and meandering in a general direction from N. to S., enters Potomac between the city of Washington and Georgetown. The slope of the whole county is indeed from N. to S., and the descent very rapid. The soil generally thin, though some favorable exceptions exist. Exclusive of W. C. and Georgetown, it contained in 1830 a population of 2,994. The entire population of the two cities and the county, was in 1830, 30,262. The Civil List of the United States, though relating rather to the whole Union, than particularly to the District of Columbia, is a matter of such general interest, that we will insert it here. CIVIL LIST, Shewing the nature and extent of the duties of each officer of the General Government of the U. States, and their salaries—with the number of clerks employed in each department, and the aggregate amount of their salaries The Department of State was created by the act of 15th September, 1798.

No elector shall vote more than once for any senator in the same district, at any one election. 3. Every white male citizen of this commonwealth resident therein, aged twenty-one years and upwards (other than such as have refused to give assurance of fidelity to the commonwealth) being possessed, or whose tenant for years, at will or at sufferance is possessed of twenty-five acres of land, with a house, the superficial content of the foundation whereof is twelve feet square, or equal to that quantity, and a plantation thereon; or fifty acres of unimproved land; or a lot or part of a lot of land in a city or town established by act of general assembly, with a house thereon of the like superficial content or quantity, having in such land an estate of freehold at the least, and (unless the title shall have come to him by descent, devise, marriage or marriage settlement) having been so possessed six months, shall be qualified to vote for delegates to serve in general assembly, for the county, city, town, borough or election district respectively, in which the land lieth. If the fifty acres of land, being one entire parcel, lie in several counties, the holder shall vote in that county wherein the greater part of the land lieth only; and if the twenty-five acres of land, being one entire parcel lie in several counties, the holder shall vote in that county wherein the house standeth only. In right of land held by parceners, joint tenants, or tenants in common, qualified to exercise the right of suffrage according to the former constitution and laws, but one vote shall be given by all the holders capable of voting, who may be present, and agree to vote for the same candidate or candidates, unless the quantity of land, in case partition had been made thereof, be sufficient to entitle every holder present to vote separately; or unless some one or more of the holders may lawfully vote in right of another estate or estates in the same county; in which case, the others may vote, if holding solely, they might have voted. 4. Every white male citizen of the commonwealth, resident therein, aged twenty-one years and upwards, being qualified to exercise the right of suffrage, according to the fourteenth section of the third article of the constitution, shall be qualified to vote for members of the general assembly, in the manner therein prescribed. If the land in the said constitution mentioned and referred to, being one entire parcel, lie in several counties, and be insufficient in value to entitle the person interested therein to vote in all the said counties, such person, whether he be possessed of an estate of freehold or leasehold; whether he be tenant in common, joint tenant or parcener, shall vote in that county wherein the greater part of the land lieth only; and any citizen claiming the right to vote, in consequence of being entitled to a reversion, or vested remainder in fee, expectant on an estate for life or lives, in land, which, being one entire parcel, may happen to lie in several counties, and be insufficient in value to entitle such citizen to vote in all the said counties, shall vote in that county wherein the greater part of the land lieth only. In case of two or more tenants in common, joint tenants or parceners, in possession, reversion or remainder, having an interest in land, the value whereof shall be insufficient to entitle them all to vote, and who, not being qualified to exercise the right of suffrage, according to the former constitution and laws, have had that right conferred upon them by the present constitution, their vote or votes shall in such case be given in manner following, that is to say: if the value of land be sufficient to entitle them to one vote only, the same shall be given by all the said tenants in common, joint tenants or parceners, capable of voting, who may be present, and agree to vote for the same candidate or candidates. If the value of the land be sufficient to entitle them to more than one vote, the votes to which they are entitled, shall be given by all the said tenants in common, joint tenants or parceners, capable of voting, who may be present, and agree as to the candidate or candidates to whom the said votes shall be given. No one of any number of such tenants in common, joint tenants or parceners, shall give more than one vote at the same election; nor shall any greater number of votes be given by such tenants in common, joint tentants or parceners, than the value of the undivided land held by them may entitle them to give, according to the constitution. When a vote or votes shall have been given as aforesaid, by such tenants in common, joint tenants or parceners, the whole of the said tenants in common, joint tenants and parceners, not having been present, and not having agreed to the said vote or votes, if he or they, who were absent at the giving of the said vote or votes, should afterwards appear at the said election, before the taking of the votes is at an end, and to the officer conducting the said election, object to the said votes as given, the same shall be stricken from the poll. When an election shall be held at different places in the same county, and such tenants in common, joint tenants or parceners, entitled to only one vote, shall be polled at different places, and for a different candidate or candidates, their votes shall be stricken from the poll. When an election shall be held at different places in the same county, and such tenants in common, joint tenants or parceners, entitled to give more votes than one, shall give their votes at different places, and in opposition to each other, the said votes shall be stricken from the poll, if it shall appear that all the said tenants in common, joint tenants or parceners, did not agree, before such votes were polled, to whom they should be given. In case of two or more of such tenants in common, joint tenants or parceners in possession, reversion or remainder, having interest in land, the value whereof shall be insufficient to entitle them all to vote, if some one or more of them may lawfully vote in right of another estate or estates in the same county, the others may vote in the same manner as if he or they, holding such other estate or estates in the same county, had no interest whatever in the undivded land belonging to the said tenants in common joint tenants or parceners. 5. If any person shall vote a second time at any election for members of general assembly; or if any person shall claim and exercise the right of suffrage, in consequence of having paid a part of the revenue of the commonwealth, with which he may have been, by his own procurement, falsely assessed; each and every such person shall, for his offence, forfeit and pay to the commonwealth, for the benefit of the literary fund, the sum of thirty three dollars thirty-three cents, recoverable by motion in the superior or inferior court of law held for the county, city, town or borough, in which the offence is committed, in the name and on behalf of the president and directors of the literary fund, provided ten days notice shall have been given of such motion. 6. Every elector going to, abiding at, and returning from, an election, shall be privileged from arrest one day for every twenty miles he shall necessarily travel, exclusive of the day of election: and any process against such elector, executed during such privilege, shall be void. 7. And it shall be the duty of the sheriff or other officer conducting such election, not to enter on the poll the vote of any person who may offer to vote, unless he believes such person to be qualified to vote, or unless such person shall take an oath, which the said sheriff or other officer conducting said election, is hereby authorised to administer, or make solemn affirmation before the said sheriff or other officer conducting the said election, in this form "I, A B do swear, (or do solemnly affirm, as the case may be,) that I do in my conscience believe myself to be duly qualified to vote for a delegate or delegates for the county, city, town, borough, or election district of      , or for a senator for the district of which the county, city, town, borough, or election district of       is a part, to serve in the general assembly of this commonwealth: So help me God." Of which oath or affirmation, a note shall be made in the poll book opposite, and referring to, the name of the person swearing or affirming. The making such oath or affirmation, or any other oath or affirmation by this act required, falsely, shall be perjury. 8. In the case of an election of a delegate or delegates for a county, city, town, or borough, the candidate or candidatrs appearing to have the greatest number of votes, shall be considered elected; or when the greatest number of votes for several candidates, if it be an election of a delegate or delegates for a county, city, town or borough, shall be equal to one another, the sheriff or other officer who conducted the election at the court-house, may and shall declare which of the candidates he will elect, notwithstanding his vote as an elector may have been previously entered on the poll. 9. The officers conducting elections at the court-house of each county, city, town, or borough, within the senatorial districts of this commonwealth, shall meet at the times and places herein above directed, and from the said polls of their respective counties, cities, towns and boroughs, shall certify as the senator elected, the man who shall have the greatest number of votes in the whole district; and if the greatest number of votes for several persons to be a senator be equal to one another, and the votes of the returning officers be equal also, it shall be decided by a lot taken by such returning officers at their said meeting, a copy of which certificate shall be forthwith set up by them at the front door of the court-house of the county, city, town, or borough, at which their said meeting may be held, informing the public of the name of the senator elected in manner aforesaid, and another copy thereof shall be by them delivered to the clerk of the said county, city, town, or borough, to be by him safely kept and preserved in his office, and the said clerk shall suffer any candidate or elector, at any time, to take a copy thereof. 10. No elector shall be admitted to a poll a second time at one and the same election, although at the first time he shall not have voted for as many candidates as by law he might have voted for. If the electors, who appear, be so numerous, that they cannot all be polled before sun-setting, or if by rain or rise of water courses, many of the electors may have been hindered from attending, the sheriff, or under sheriff, or other proper officer conducting such election at the court-house, and the superintendents of any separate poll, (if such cause shall exist at any separate poll, for the adjournment thereof,) may and shall, by request of any one or more of the candidates or their agents, adjourn the proceeding on the poll until the next day, and so from day to day, for three days, (Sundays excluded,) giving public notice thereof by proclamation, at the door of the court-house or other place of holding such election, and shall, on the last day of the election, conclude the poll according to the directions aforesaid; but if the poll to be held at any such election, is not closed on the first day, the same shall be kept open two days thereafter. 11. In all cases whatsoever, where by law the sheriff is directed to hold an election, in case of the death of the said sheriff, or other officer, whose duty it shall be to conduct such election, or where there shall be no such officer, the senior magistrate, and in his absence, inability, or incapacity, by being a candidate, the second, and so in succession to the junior magistrate, is hereby authorised empowered and required to perform the duties of the sheriff, prescribed by law in similar cases. And if the mayor of any town, city or borough, entitled to representation in the general assembly, shall, by death or any other cause whatever, be unable to attend and conduct the election according to the provisions of this act, the recorder, or if there be no recorder, or he be unable to attend, the senior alderman capable of attending, shall attend and conduct such election according to law. 12. On complaint to either house of assembly, of an undue election or return of any member to their house, which complaint shall be lodged against such member within ten days after the meeting of the assembly, where the contested election shall have been held at the stated annual period, or within thirty days after the day on which the election shall have commenced, (if it be the election of a delegate,) or within thirty days after the day on which the last election in the senatorial district shall have commenced, (if it be the election of a senator,) where such election shall have been held in consequence of an intermediate vacancy, and such house shall be in session, or if not in session, within twenty days after the meeting of the general assembly, such house shall forthwith appoint some day for trying the same, as shortly as shall be consistent with fair enquiry, whereof notice shall be given by the speaker to the party against whom the complaint is, if he be absent, which day of trial may be lengthened from time to time, on good cause shewn to the house, and notice to the absent party. On the day appointed for the trial, the committee of privileges and elections shall proceed in the said disputed election, and report to the house of which they are members, their opinion thereon, before they proceed to any other business; and the said house shall, on receipt of the said report, immediately proceed to determine thereon, and either confirm or disagree to such report, as to them shall seem just. If any person sworn before the said committee, shall give or withhold any evidence, under such circumstances as would have constituted the same to be perjury, if done in the presence of a court of record, the same shall be deemed perjury. If upon such trial, in the case of a contested election of a delegate, it shall appear that equal numbers of qualified electors shall have voted for the petitioner and the sitting member, and the officer who conducted the election at the court-house of the county, city, town, or borough, (if it be the election of a delegate from a county, city, town, or borough,) or a majority of the returning officers of the election district, (if it be the election of a delegate from an election district,) shall swear, or solemnly affirm, that if such equality had appeared at the election in the former case, or at the time of their meeting to make the return in the latter case, he or they would have declared the petitioner elected, such petitioner shall be deemed duly elected, and his name, instead of the name of the sitting member, (which shall be erased,) shall be inserted in the certificate of return. If upon such trial, in the case of a contested election of a senator, it shall appear that equal numbers of qualified electors shall have voted for the petitioner and the sitting member, and a majority of the officers who made the return upon such election, shall swear, or solemnly affirm, that if such equality had appeared at the time of their meeting to make the said return, they would have declared the petitioner elected, such petitioner shall be deemed duly elected, and his name, instead of the name of the sitting member, (which shall be erased,) shall be inserted in the certificate of return. 13. The officers directed to make certificates of elections as aforesaid, shall cause them to be delivered, those of delegates, to the clerk of the house of delegates, and those of senators, to the clerk of the senate, one day at least before the succeeding session of general assembly. 14. For election of a delegate or senator, when a vacancy shall occur by death or resignation, during the recess of the general assembly, a writ or writs shall be issued by the governor and in all other cases of vacancy, such writ or writs shall be issued by the speaker of that house whereof he was a member; but if the vacancy be occasioned by acceptance of an office, the writ or writs shall not be issued without the special order of the house. And the officer or officers to whom such writ or writs shall be directed, so soon after the receipt thereof as he or they may be able, shall give to the electors notice thereof, as well as of the time and place of election, by advertisement to be affixed at four of the most convenient places in the county, city, town or borough, and shall cause the election to be made in the manner herein before prescribed, and shall have the same power of adjourning the proceeding upon the poll, as in case of a general election. 15. Any person who shall be a candidate for any county, city, town, borough, election district or senatorial district, to serve, if elected, in the general assembly, who shall, directly or indirectly, give or agree to give, any elector or pretended elector, money, meat, drink, or other reward, in order to be elected, or for having been elected, or who shall treat, directly or indirectly, being a candidate for such or any other county, city, town, borough, or election district, or senatorial district, upon due proof thereof to either house, shall be expelled. Provided, nevertheless, That nothing herein centained shall be so construed, as to prevent any candidate from his usual intercourse of friendship with his neighbors at his own house. 16. If any sheriff or other officer conducting an election, shall, directly or indirectly, so interfere in the election of senators or delegates, as to shew partiality for any of the candidates, he shall forfeit and pay the sum of six hundred and sixty-six dollars sixty-six cents, to be recovered by bill, plaint or information, in any court of record, one moiety to the use of the informer, and the other to the use of the commonwealth, for the benefit of the literary fund. 17. All and every member and members of the general assembly are, and ought to be and forever shall be, in their persons, servants and estates, both real and personal, free, exempt and privileged from all arrests, attachments, executions, and all other process whatsoever, save only for treason, felony, or breach of the peace, during his or their attendance upon the general assembly, and one day before and after, for every twenty miles they must necessarily travel to or from home; and, in the mean time, process in which they are parties, shall be suspended without abatement or discontinuance; and, if any person taken in execution, be delivered by privilege of either house of the general assembly, so soon as such privilege ceaseth, he shall return himself a prisoner in execution, or be liable to an escape. 18. Whereas, the freedom of speech and proceedings appertaineth of right to the general assembly, and the preservation thereof is necessary to secure the liberty of the people: Be it enacted, That if any person shall arrest or prosecute, or be aiding or abetting in arresting and prosecuting a member or members of the senate or house of delegates, for or on account of any words spoken or written, any proposition made, or proceedings had in the senate or house of delegates, every such person so offending, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be apprehended, committed and tried therefor, as in other cases of misdemeanors, before the general court, or a superior court of law of this commonwealth; and, being thereof convicted by the verdict of a jury, shall be adjudged to suffer imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year, and shall pay a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars; which imprisonment and fine shall be assessed by a jury. 19. And if any member or members of the said senate or house of delegates, shall be arrested or imprisoned, for, or on account of any words, spoken or written, or for any proposition made, or proceedings had in the said senate or house of delegates, such member or members may apply to the general court, or a superior court of law, or any judge thereof in vacation, for a writ of habeas corpus, who are hereby empowered and required to issue the same, returnable before the said court, or said judge, or any other judge, and, upon the return thereof, to liberate and discharge such member or members. 20. The provisions of this act shall be extended to the arresting and prosecuting any person or persons, for words spoken or written, or for any propositions made, or proceedings had in the said senate or house of delegates, and to the discharging and liberating any person or persons, by habeas corpus, as aforesaid, although such person or persons shall, by disqualification, or from any other causes, have ceased to be a member of the said senate or house of delegates, at the time of such arrest or prosecution, or of the trial, judgment, or imprisonment, in consequence thereof. Provided, That nothing herein contained shall, in any respect, extend to the power which either house of the general assembly now hath or may exercise over their respective members. 21. Any person intending to contest the election of any other person, as a senator or delegate from any senatorial district, county, city, town or borough, or election district, shall, within twenty-fiive days after the day on which the last election in the former case shall have commenced, or within fifteen days after the day on which the election (if it be the election of a delegate for a county, city, town or borough,) shall have commenced, or within twenty days after the day on which the last election (if it be the election of a delegate for an election district,) shall have commenced, give to the person whose election he intends to contest, notice thereof in writing; and moreover, shall deliver to him, at the same time, a list of those persons to whose votes he hath objection, with the objection to each voter written opposite to his name, stating that the person objected to, is not qualified to 66 vote according to the constitution, or in case of incapacity, that he labors under some express personal disability, according to the provisions thereof, to exercise the right of suffrage; and where he hath any other objection to the legality of the election, or eligibility of the person whose election he intends to contest as aforesaid, (such objection to the eligibility of such person, being founded upon his want of all, or any of the qualifications required by the constitution,) he shall in like manner give notice thereof, distinguishing his particular objections; and the person whose election is contested as aforesaid, shall, within twenty days after receiving such notice, deliver the like lists on his part. 22. Whensoever the election of any person as a senator or delegate, is intended to be contested, the petitioner and the returned member shall respectively begin to take their depositions within one month after the delivery of the notice in writing as aforesaid, given by the petitioner to the returned member, informing him as aforesaid, of his intention to contest his election; and they shall finish taking the same at least thirty days preceding the commencement of the ensuing session of the general assembly. And where such contest shall arise in consequence of any return made, on any writ or writs issued by the governor, or by the speaker of either house of the general assembly, to supply any vacancy which may have happened, the party contesting shall give notice in writing to the returned member of his intention to contest his election, and moreover shall deliver to him a list of those persons to whose votes he hath objection, with the objection to each voter written opposite to his name, stating that the person objected to is not qualified to vote according to the constitution, or in case of incapacity, that he labors under some express personal disability, according to the provisions thereof, to exercise the right of suffrage; and if he have any other objection to the legality of the election, or the eligibility of the member returned as aforesaid, (such objection to the eligibility of such member being founded upon his want of all or any of the qualifications required by the constitution,) he shall in like manner give notice thereof, distinguishing his particular objections, within ten days after the last day on which votes shall have been taken in the said election; and the member returned as aforesaid, shall within five days after receiving such notice, deliver the like lists on his part. 23. Notice in any of the cases before mentioned, as well as the lists left with his wife or any other free person over the age of twenty-one years, belonging to his family, other than a negro or mulatto, or in case of their absence, then at some public place at the dwelling house, shall be deemed sufficient. The depositions shall be certified by the commissioners taking the same, sealed up, and sent by them to the clerk of that house of which the person was returned a member, without delay; and the depositions taken as aforesaid, shall be by the clerk of the house, respectively, delivered to the speaker thereof, to be committed with the petition of the party complaining, and shall be received and read as evidence upon the hearing thereof; subject, however, to the exceptions of the opposite party. 24. Subpœnas for witnesses shall be issued by the clerks of the courts of the counties, cities, towns or boroughs, upon the application of either party; and the witnesses shall be entitled to the same allowance, be privileged from arrests, and be subject to the like penalties, as witnesses attending the county courts. 25. It shall be lawful to hold a separate poll to choose an elector or electors for president and vice-president of the United States in any county of this state, at such place or places, as now, or may hereafter be prescribed for holding a separate poll or polls for the election of members of the general assembly: And the persons qualified according to law to vote for members of the general assembly of this state, shall assemble at the place or places directed for holding such separate poll or polls, on the first Monday in November in every fourth year, according to the provisions of the act, entitled "an act to reduce into one act the acts now in force providing for the appointment of electors to choose a president and vice-president of the United States," passed February the eighteenth, eighteen hundred and twenty-three. 26. If from death, sickness or other cause, the returning officer, herein before designated, in any case of a senatorial election, or in any case of an election of a delegate for an election district, shall be unable to attend for the purpose of comparing the polls, and making the returns at the time and place prescribed by law, then such duties, and all other duties consequent thereupon, shall be performed in the following manner, that is to say: If the sheriff, being the proper returning officer, shall have died, then the duties aforesaid shall be performed by his successor, if any there be; if there be no successor, then by the coroner of the county; if such sheriff be sick, or otherwise unable to attend, the said duties shall be performed by such of his deputies as he shall appoint for that purpose; or if he have no deputy, by the coroner. If the deputy sheriff, being the proper returning officer, shall have died, or be unable to attend, the said duties shall be performed by the high sheriff, or by deputy. If a mayor, being the proper returning officer, shall have died, or be unable to attend, the said duties shall be performed by his successor, if any there be; if none, by the recorder; if no recorder, then by the senior alderman capable of attending. If a recorder, being the proper returning officer, shall have died, or be unable to attend, the said duties shall be performed by the mayor, if any; if none, by the senior alderman capable of attending. If a magistrate or alderman, being the proper returning officer, shall have died, or be unable to attend, the said duties shall be performed by the magistrate or alderman next in seniority, and capable of attending. And if there shall be no person hereby authorised, who shall be able to attend and perform the said duties, then the clerk of the county, city, town or borough, as the case may be, shall be bound in all things promptly to perform the duties aforesaid. 27. The election of members of the house of representatives of the congress of the United States, shall continue to be held in the manner, and according to the principles prescribed by the laws now in force in relation thereto; except that all persons now authorised to vote for members of the house of delegates, shall hereafter be allowed to vote in such elections; and except also, that the said elections shall be held in the several counties, cities, towns, and boroughs, on their respective court days in the month of August of the present year, and on their respective court days in the month of April, in the year eighteen hundred and thirty-three; and also, on their respective court days in the month of April, in every second year thereafter; and except also, that the officers holding and conducting such elections for members of congress shall, before such election commences, take an oath to conduct the election fairly, in the like form with that prescribed by the tuelfth* * The section referred to is the eleventh. section of this act, to be taken by the sheriff or other officer conducting elections of members of the general assembly. The Ratification of Virginia to the Constitution of the United States. We, the delegates of the people of Virginia, duly elected, in pursuance of a recommendation of the General Assembly, and now met in convenhaving fully and fairly investigated and discussed the proceedings of the federal convention, and being prepared as well as the most mature deliberation will enable us, to decide thereon, DO, in the name and behalf of the people of Virginia, declare and make known, that the powers granted under the constitution being derived from the people of the United States, may be resumed by them whensoever the same shall be perverted to their injury or oppression, and that every power not granted thereby, remains with them and at their will: that therefore no right, of any denomination, can be cancelled, abridged, restrained or modified by the Congress, by the Senate, or House of Representatives, acting in any capacity, by the president, or any department or officer of the United States, except in those instances where power is given by the constitution for those purposes: that among other essential rights, the liberty of conscience and of the press, cannot be cancelled, abridged, restrained or modified by any authority of the United States: With these impressions, with a solemn appeal to the Searcher of hearts for the purity of our intentions, and under the conviction, that, whatsoever imperfections may exist in the constitution, ought rather to be examined in the mode prescribed therein, than to bring the union into danger by delay, with a hope of obtaining amendments previous to the ratification: We, the said delegates, in the name and in behalf of the people of Virginia, do, by these presents, assent to and ratify the constitution, recommended on the 17th day of September, 1787, by the federal convention for the government of the United States; hereby announcing to all those whom it may concern, that the said constitution is binding upon the said people, according to an authentic copy hereto annexed, in the words following: A Declaration of Rights made by the Representatives of the People of Virginia, assembled and held at the Capitol in the City of Williamsburg, in full and free Convention—which rights do pertain to them and their posterity as a basis and foundation of Government. (Agreed to nem con, June, 12th, 1776.) I. That there are certain natural rights, of which men, when they form a social compact, cannot deprive or divest their posterity; among which are the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety. II. That all power is naturally vested in, and consequently derived from, the people; that magistrates, therefore, are their trustees and agents, and at all times amenable to them. III. That government ought to be instituted for the common benefit, protection, and security of the people; and that the doctrine of non-resistance against arbitrary power and oppression, is absurd, slavish, and destructive to the good and happiness of mankind. IV. That no man or set of men are entitled to exclusive or separate public emoluments or privileges from the community, but in consideration of public services; which not being descendable, neither ought the offices of magistrate, legislator, judge or any other public offices to be hereditary. V. That the legislative, executive, and judiciary powers of government should be separate and distinct: and, that the members of the two first may be restrained from oppression by feeling and participating the public burdens, they should at fixed periods be reduced to a private station—return into the mass of the people; and the vacancies supplied by certain and regular elections, in which all or any part of the members to be eligible or ineligible, as the rules of the constitution of government, and the laws shall direct. VI. That elections of representatives in the legislature ought to be free and frequent: and all men, having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with, and attachment to, the community, ought to have the right of suffrage; and no aid, charge, tax, or fee can be set, rated or levied upon the people, without their own consent, or that of their representatives so elected, nor can they be bound by any law, to which they have not in like manner assented for the public good. VII. That all power of suspending laws, or the execution of laws, by any authority without the consent of the representatives of the people, in the legislature, is injurious to their rights, and ought not to be exercised. VIII. That in all capital and criminal prosecutions, a man hath a right to demand the cause and nature of his accusations; to be confronted with the accusers and witnesses; to call for evidence, and be allowed counsel in his favor; and to a fair and speedy trial, by an impartial jury of his vicinage, without whose unanimous consent, he cannot be found guilty (except in the government of the land and naval forces); nor can he be compelled to give evidence against himself. IX. That no freeman ought to be taken, imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties, privileges, or franchises, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner destroyed or deprived of his life, liberty, or property, but by the law of the land. X. That every freeman, restrained of his liberty, is entitled to a remedy, to enquire into the lawfulness thereof, and to remove the same, if unlawful; and that such remedy ought not to be denied or delayed. XI. That in controversies respecting property, and in suits between man and man, the ancient trial by jury is one of the greatest securities to the rights of the people, and ought to remain sacred and inviolable. XII. That every freemen ought to find a certain remedy of recourse to the laws for all injuries and wrongs he may receive in his person, property, or character. He ought to obtain right and justice freely without sale, completely and without denial, promptly and without delay, and that all establishments or regulations, contravening these rights, are oppressive and unjust: XIII. That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted. XIV. That every freeman has a right to be secure from all unreasonable searches, and seizures of his person, his papers, and property; all warrants, therefore, to search suspected places, or seize any freeman, his papers, or property, without information upon oath (or affirmation of a person religiously scrupulous of taking an oath) of legal and sufficient cause, are grievous and oppressive, and all general warrants to search suspected places, or to apprehend any suspected person without specially naming or describing the place or person, are dangerous and ought not to be granted. XV. That the people have a right peaceably to assemble together to consult for the common good, or to instruct their representatives: and that every freeman has a right to petition, or apply to the legislature for redress of grievances. XVI. That the people have a right to freedom of speech, and of writing, and publishing their sentiments; that the freedom of the press is one of the greatest bulwarks of liberty, and ought not to be violated. XVII. That the people have a right to keep and bear arms; that a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people trained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defence of a free state. That standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty, and therefore ought to be avoided, as far as the circumstances and protection of the community will admit; and that in all cases, the military should be under strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power. XVIII. That no soldier in time of peace ought to be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner, and in time of war in such manner only as the laws direct. XIX. That any person religiously scrupulous of bearing arms, ought to be exempted upon payment of an equivalent to employ another to bear arms in his stead. XX. That religion, or the duty which we owe to our Creator, and the manner of discharging it, can be directed only by reason and conviction, not by force or violence, and therefore all men have an equal, natural and unalienable right to the free exercise of religion according to the dictates of conscience, and that no particular religious sect or society ought to be favored or established by law in preference to others.

That the exclusive power of legislation given to congress over the federal town and its adjacent district, and other places, purchased or to be purchased by congress, of any of the states, shall extend only to such regulations as respect the police and good government thereof. XIII. That no person shall be capable of being President of the United States for more than eight years in any term of sixteen years. XIV. That the judicial power of the United States shall be vested in one supreme court, and in such courts of admiralty, as congress may, from time to time, ordain and establish in any of the different states: the judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and equity, arising under treaties, made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States; to all cases affecting ambassadors, other foreign ministers and consuls; to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more states, and between parties claiming lands under the grants of different states. In all cases affecting ambassadors, other foreign ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be a party, the supreme court shall have original jurisdiction; in all other cases before mentioned, the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction, as to matters of law only: except in cases of equity, and of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; in which the supreme court shall have appellate jurisdiction both as to law and fact, with such exceptions and under such regulations as the congress shall make: but the judicial power of the United States shall extend to no case where the cause of action shall have originated before the ratification of this constitution; except in disputes between states about their territory; disputes between persons claiming lands under the grants of different states; and suits for debts due to the United States. XV. That in criminal prosecutions, no man shall be restrained in the exercise of the usual and accustomed right of challenging or excepting to the jury. XVI.

CHAPTER I INTRODUCTION, PROGRESS OF COMMERCE, ROANOKE SETTLEMENTS, Merit of discovering America,—Advancement of Commerce by the crusades—in the Italian cities—in Spain, in Portugal,—Discovery of America,—England,—Want of Commerce in early times,—Voyages of the Cabots,—Progress of English discovery—Frobisher—Gilbert—Raleigh,—Failure of the Roanoke settlements. The claims of the Icelanders, the Welsh, and even the Norwegians* * Winterbotham's America, vol. I p. 1 and 2, and Hinton's United States. to the discovery of America, seem in modern times to be universally set aside in favor of a native of a milder clime. Indeed the evidence by which their respective claims were sought to be established was so vague, contradictory and unsatisfactory;† † Bancroft's Hist. U. States, vol. I p. 6, and notes. and their discoveries if proven, so entirely accidental, and useless to mankind, that it is not at all astonishing that all the merit should be given to that individual whose brilliant genius first demonstrated a priori the existence of a continent in the western waters, and whose adventurous daring‡ ‡ "L'Italie reparut, avec les divins tresors que les Grees fugitifs rapporterent dans sou sein; la ciel lui revela ses lois; l'audace de ses enfants decouvrit un nouvel hemisphere."—De Stael—Corinne. led him to risque his life in the search of a world, of the existence of which he was only informed by his science, with little aid of any human experience; or that posterity should give to Columbus the undivided glory of an exploit for which he received only the ignominy of his contemporaries, and to Italy the honor due the birth place of so distinguished a son, from whose brilliant atchievements she has received little else. The spirit of commerce and navigation had been spreading extensively in Europe, for some time prior to the discovery of America. The maritime towns of Italy early perceived and enjoyed the advantages of trade, and Venice, Genoa and Pisa sprung under the magic of its influence, from insignificant towns to the wealth and splendor of populous and magnificent cities. This favorable result was much promoted by the crusades. In the Holy wars the Italian cities furnished the transports necessary for the conveyance of the immense hordes of northern and western warriors, with their accoutrements and attendants, which a love of military adventure, and religious fanaticism, were pouring upon the plains of Asia. The vast sums received for these services, and for the supply of provisions to the christian host, together with the privileges granted them in many of the conquered places,—the discovery of new subjects of commerce, and opening new avenues of trade,—the extension of the knowledge of the countries of the east and the people who inhabited them,—conspiring with the freedom of commerce and boldness of enterprize of the Italian towns themselves, and the taste spread through Europe by the returning soldiers of the cross for those eastern luxuries and refinements to which they had become accustomed,— expanded the commerce of the world immensely beyond all former bounds, and threw that commerce almost exclusively into the hands of the towns of Italy.* * Robertson's Ch. V. and History of America. The spirit of discovery and commercial adventure so happily aroused and extended by the wild and visionary schemes of religious bigots for the emancipation of the holy land was destined to be yet further extended by religious zeal mingled with ignorant superstition. Benjamin, a Jew travelled from Constantinople through the countries of the Euxine and Capian Seas to Chinese Tartary, in the vain hope of discovering his own sect ruling in opulence and power, some country of which Europe was ignorant. Innocent IV, sent two monks to Zengis Khan in the midst of his victories, and equally ignorant of the Pope as of the christian doctrines, with orders to embrace the christian religion, and to cease desolating the earth. St. Louis of France being made to believe that a Tartar Chan had embraced the christian faith, and perceiving the advantages which the christians could have by the exertions of such an ally, in their future wars with the Saracens, immediately despatched two monks to him as ambassadors; and one of these made a more extensive circuit through the interior of Asia than any European had done before him. To these succeeded the long commercial and exploring expeditions of the celebrated. Venetian adventurer, Marco Polo, who in the course of his rambling perigrinations of 26 years duration, penetrated to Cambalu or Pekin the capital of the great empire of Cathay or China, and increased immensely the information of Europe as to the situation and condition of countries, from which they had long drawn luxuries, through circuitous commerce, without knowing even the position of the country whence they came. Half a century after the Venetian had astonished the yet ignorant and almost semi-barbarous inhabitants of Europe, with his ac- A. D. 1322. count of the vast extent, wealth, population, variety of manufactures and extent of trade of the east, his account was confirmed in the most essential particulars by Sir John Mandeville an English gentleman, who excited by his example visited most of the countries of the east which he had described. Whilst this spirit of enterprise was developing itself, and Europe becoming more settled and civilized, was looking with eager anxiety towards the vast fields for commerce opening to the east,—another son of Italy, so obscure or so neglected, that we know not his history, habits or profession, was about to produce a new era in the history of commerce, and to advance the world a great step in the progress of knowledge and civilization.— Flavio Gioia, a citizen of 1 malfi, discovered the properties of the magnet, and applied it to that indispensable instrument of modern navigation, the mariner's compass. This discovery rendered it no longer necessary for the cantious mariner to hug the coast for his safety, but he might boldly venture upon the broad bosom of the deep, and though the sun went down, and the stars shone not, he feared nothing, for the humble citizen of Amalfi had provided him with a guide safer than the coast, and an unerring pilot, whose knowledge darkness and storms could not obscure or obliterate. The first dawning of this bolder spirit seems to have been exhibited by the Spaniards in the discovery of the Canary and Fortunate Islands, which lie near five hundred miles from the coast of Spain, and more than a hundred and fifty from the African coast. But although Spain was destined to surpass all other nations in the magnitude of her maritime discoveries, by the discovery of America, yet she was not the immediate agent of extending that spirit of maritime adventure, and nautical information which contributed so materially in bringing about that event. Her discoveries of the Fortunate and the Canary Isles seem rather to have been the result of accident than a permanent course of well directed experiments. It is to one of the smallest and least powerful kingdoms of Europe that we are indebted for that boldness of conception and persevering enthusiasm of execution, in voyages of discovery, from which only grandeur of results in any undertaking can ever be expected to spring. The final expulsion of the Moors from Portugal, left many ardent and adventurous spirits without occupation, and Portugal being a small maritime state, too weak to cope with the powerful kingdoms in its neighborhood, whose prowess was equal to its own, naturally looked upon the sea as the field of its future exploits, and source of its future great- A. D. 1411. ness. John I. surnamed the Bastard, having fixed his own title to the crown by a peace with Castile, determined to find employment for the restless spirits of his kingdom by an expedition against the Moors on the neighboring coast of Africa, but whilst it was fitting out he despatched a few vessels along the coast of Africa in search of undiscovered countries. This expedition succeeded in doubling Cope Non, which had hitherto been the Ultima Thule of modern navigation. The success of the king's expedition against the Moors in- A. D. 1417. fused into the nation a spirit for new enterprises. Prince Henry, duke of Viseo, the fourth son of John by the sister of Henry IV of England, became the patron and superintendant of the new enterprizes. Under his auspices Porto Santo, and Madeira were discover- A. D. 1418. ed and colonized. It was to his care that the latter island was indebted for a stock of domestic animals, a supply of seeds, and slips of the vine, the cultivation of which, produced such a valuable article A. D. 1420. of commerce for the Portuguese, and of luxury for the world. The discovery of these islands introduced among the Spaniards a bolder system of navigation. They no longer crept along the coast from head land to head land, which was in truth the most difficult and dangerous navigation, but they ventured to keep the open sea, and were thus enabled to pass with ease difficulties which had before seemed insuperable. Cape Bojardor which had been a barrier for twenty years, was passed, and the whole coast explored from Cape Blanco to Cape de Verd. Prince Henry whose mind seems to have been in advance of the age in which he lived, manifestly contemplated a passage to India, around the southern coast of Africa. He was not deterred by the idea which many had taken up from the writings of the ancients that the regions of the torrid zone were rendered uninhabitable by their excessive heat, even when this idea seemed to be confirmed as they advanced south, by finding the inhabitants jet black, their hair short and curled, their noses flat, and their lips thick. Nor was he deterred by the captious objections of the envious little politicians about his father's court. But with the double view of silencing objections, enlisting religious zeal in his favor, and acquiring a title to his discoveries, the validity of which no christian prince or country of that day would have dared to dispute,—he obtained a bull from Pope Eugene IV giving him an exclusive right to all countries which he should discover from Cape Non to the continent of India. The fame of prince Henry's discoveries spread rapidly through Europe, and attracted to him all of the adventurous spirits of the age, who had acquired any knowledge of the science of navigation. The A. D. 1449. Cape de Verd Islands, and the Azores were discovered, and every discovery added new stimulus to naval enterprise, as every voyage added new information to naval science. In the midst of his successful career he was unfortunately A. D. 1463. checked by the hand of death, and Alphonso who occupied the throne at the time of his death, being busily engaged in other pursuits, suffered the spirit of enterprize to languish during the remainder of his reign. His son and successor John II. speedily revived the spirit of A. D. 1481. discovery among his subjects, and by his zeal and efficiency more than compensated for the supineness of his predecessor. He soon found out the advantages of a trade with the natives of the African coast, after he passed the Great Desert, and reached the regions of ivory, gold and precious gums. He had the merit of demonstrating the fallacy of the opinion that the torrid zone was uninhabitable, and found that so far from this, it was populous and fertile. He too conceived the idea of opening an intercourse with India, around the southern point of Africa, and persevered in his favorite object with unwavering zeal, until the practicability of accomplishing his wishes, was fully established by Bartholomew Diaz, who reached the extreme southern point but was unable to pass it, by reason of the violent storms which he there encountered, and the crazy condition of his vessel. This point which Diaz named Cabo Tormentozo, in commemoration of the difficulties which he had there encountered, John called the Cape of Good Hope, in manifestation of his delight at the certain prospect of the accomplishment of his wishes. It has retained the latter name. This near prospect of an easier and more direct route to India, had already began to excite the jealousy of the Venetians, who then nearly monopolized the trade of India, and to elevate the hopes of the Portuguese, who expected to enjoy a portion of the wealth and luxury which the Venitians derived from that trade; when the minds of both, and indeed of all Europe were turned in another direction by the occurrence of an event in the history of maritime discovery, compared with which all others sunk into insignificance. This event was the discovery of America, by Christopher Columbus. The education of this daring mariner, his disappointments Oct. 11, 1492. and dangers, his difficulties and his brilliant success, or the melancholy story of his sad reverses, and the example afforded in him of the ingratitude of kings it is not the purpose of the writer to narrate. He refrains from recounting so temptingly interesting a narrative, because it would lead him too far from his purpose, which is only to narrate succinctly the progress of navigation and discovery to the time of the first colony settled in Virginia,—and because the same story has been so well told by Robertson, Irving* * This work the writer regrets that by some accident, he has never had an opportunity of looking into until recently, and that, very superficially and hurriedly, or it might have been useful to him in this sketch. It seems to be unaccountably scarce, and far too little known for its great merit. and others, that it ought to be familiar to all. Notwithstanding the advances in navigation which have been enumerated, the art of ship building was still in such a rude and imperfect state, that the vessels in which Columbus embarked on an unknown sea, a modern manner with all the advantages of modern science would scarcely venture in, to cross the Atlantic. The largest was a vessel of no considerable burden,† † Robertson—Hist. America, 49. and the two others scarcely superior in burden to large boats, and the united crews of the three only amounted to ninety men, including officers, and a few gentlemen, adventurers from Isabella's court. But notwithstanding these inadequate means for the prosecution of maritime discovery, the ardour of enterprize was so much excited by the brilliant achievements of Columbus, the greedy thirst for gain, and hope of finding some country abounding in gold, together with the eager desire which still prevailed of discovering some passage through the great continent of America, which might lead to India, that in twenty six years from the first discovery of land by Columbus;—the Spaniards had visited all of the islands of the West Indies, they had sailed on the eastern coast of America from the Rio de la Plata to the western extremity of the Mexican Gulf—they had discovered the great southern ocean, and had acquired considerable knowledge of the coast of Florida. It is also said that these voyages in search of a nearer passage to the East Indies, had extended much further north, but not however until that country had been discovered by the sea-men of another nation, of whose exploits in the field of maritime adventure we shall presently speak. The great interior was still undiscovered, the whole western and the extreme south eastern coast was still undiscovered, and the long line of coast from Florida to Labrador had only been seen, and touched upon in a few places. England did not at an early period make those advances in navigation, to which the eminent advantages of her insular situation invited, and gave no promise of that maritime distinction, and commercial wealth, to which the wise policy of her subsequent rulers have led her to attain. From the times of the conquest to the discovery of America, England had been engaged in perpetual wars, either foreign or domestic, and thus while the southern portion of Europe and the free cities on the Rhine were advancing so rapidly in opulence and power, England was destitute of even the germ of that naval strength to which she is so much indebted for her present greatness. Every article of foreign growth or fabric which she consumed, was wafted to her shores in the barks of other nations, and the subsequent mistress of the seas scarcely dared to float her flag beyond the limits of her own narrow jurisdiction. Scarcely an English ship traded with Spain or Portugal before the beginning of the fifteenth century, and it required another half century to give the British mariner courage enough to venture to the east of the Pillars of Hercules.‡ ‡ Robertson's Virginia, p. 18-19. Feeble as the marine of England then was, her reigning monarch Henry VII. did not lack the spirit required for undertaking great enterprises, and accident only deprived him of the glory of being the patron of the discoverer of America. Columbus after the failure of his own native country of Genoa, to encourage his great enterprize, and his second rebuff from, his adopted country Portugal,* * "Christophoro Colon temendo, se parimente, 1 Re Castiglia non assentessero alla sua impresa, non gli bisognasse proporla di nuovo a qualche altro principe, &amp; cost in cio passasse lungo tempo; mando in Inghelterra vn suo fratello che haueua appresso di se, chiamato Bartolomeo Colon." Extract from the 13th ch. of his. Chris. Col by his son Fenran: Col. preserved in Hacklyt, vol. III p. 22. fearing another refusal from the king of Castile to whose court he then directed his steps, despatched his brother Bartholomew to England to solicit the aid of Henry VII who being then at peace was supposed to have leisure to undertake a great enterprize which promised such renown to himself and emolument to England. Bartholomew was captured by pirates on his voyage, and robbed of all his effects, which, with an illness that followed, prevented him from presenting himself at court, after he arrived in England, until he could provide himself with suitable apparel by his skill in drawing maps and sea-charts. Feb. 13, 1488.‡ ‡ This date is preserved in some curious verses upon the map, of which we give a specimen. "Bartholmew Colon de Terra Rubra." "The yeere of Grace, a thousand and four hundred and fourscore" "And eight, and on the thirteenth day of February more "In London published this worke." To Christ all laud therefore. Idem." He brought himself to the notice of Henry by presenting him with a map,† † "Pastilo adunque Bartolomco Colon per Inghelterra, volle la sua sorte, che desse in man di corsali, i quali lo spogliarono insieme con gli altri della sua naue.

Idem. So much delay had been produced by the circumstances mentioned that Bartholomew, hastening to Castile, learned at Paris, from Charles, king of France, that his brother Christopher's efforts had already been crowned with the most brilliant success.? ? "Gia scoperte L, Indic." Hacklyt III—24. When we reflect upon the difficulties which were thrown in the way of Columbus at the court of Ferdinand and Isabella, even after they became convinced of the practicability of his scheme, and the yet more arduous difficulties which he encountered on his voyage, from the mutinous timidity of his crew, we may well doubt whether Henry's courage would have sustained him in the actual accomplishment of the enterprize, or whether England at that time afforded mariners sufficiently hardy to have persevered a sufficient length of time in a seemingly endless voyage upon an unknown sea. Fortunately, perhaps for mankind the courage of England was not put to the test of making the first great adventure, and wheth- June 24, 1497. er she would have succeeded in that or not, she was not destitute of sufficient courage to undertake an enterprize of very considerable magnitude, at that day, soon after the existence of land in our western hemisphere had been discovered. The merit of this new enterprize is also due to a native of Italy, and his motive was the same which prevailed in most of the adventures of the time, the desire to discover a new route to India. Giovanni Gaboto, better known by his Anglicised name of John Cabot, 63 a Venetian merchant who had settled at Bristol, obtained from Henry a charter for himself and his three sons Lewis, Sabastian and Santius, allowing them full power and authority to sail into all places in the eastern, western or northern sea under the banners of England, with five ships, at their own proper costs and charges, to discover countries before unknown to christians, to plant the banners of England in all such places, and to take possession of them, to hold as vassals of England, to have the exclusive monopoly of the trade of all such places, paying to the king one-fifth of the clear profits of every voyage. All other persons were prohibited from visiting such places, and the Cabots were bound always to land on their return only at Bristol.* * Hacklyt, Robertson, Marshall, Bancroft, Burke, &amp;c. Under this patent containing "the worst features of colonial monopoly and commercial restriction." John Cabot and his celebrated son Sebastian embarked for the west. The object of Cabot being to discover the passage to India, he pursued a course more northwardly than any selected by previous navigators, and the first land he reached was the coast of Newfoundland, which on that account he named Prima Vista, next the Island of St. John, and finally the continent, among the "Polar bears, the rude savages and dismal cliffs of Labrador," and this seems to have been the only fruit of the first† † It seems to have been a prevalent error among historians to confound this first English expedition of John Cabot with his son Sebastian, under his orders, with the second expedition under the sole command of Sebastian, and the second expedition being of most importance, as a much larger portion of the continent was dcovered, is most frequently spoken of, and the credit of it is of course given to Sebastian to whom it is due, and the first expedition having unaccountably been blended with the second, John has not received that credit which he deserved. This may account for the reason why it would appear that it had been attempted to deprive the father of the glory of having accompanied the expedition, as Bancroft (vol. I, p. 10,) thinks, and may solve the difficulty which Burke thinks insuperable, (vol. I p. 37,). Robertson blends the two voyages, but gives John the credit of both, he is followed by Marshall, Burke and Holmes, (Am. An. vol. I p. 17,). The fact of the two voyages may be established by the clearest evidence, and thus the father may be entitled to the merit of being the first discoverer, and his son Sebastian of extending the discovery from a small barren unpromising coast to the whole continent. See Bancroft, vol. I. p. 10, and 12, and references there quoted. The first voyage was in 1497, the second in 1498, the first was undertaken with six ships, the second with only two, and three hundred men,—there is no account of the first expedition after the first discoveries of Newfoundland, and the Island of St. John; there is a detailed account of the voyage of the second up and down the coast from the 56th degree of lat, to the coast of Florida, &amp;c. See Hacklyt III, 27, and 28—and V. 282—3. There seems, however an error in both of these, last references, in the latter by making Sebastian Cabot a "Venetian born," and in the former in making him say that he undertook the voyage by reason of the fame of the discoveries of Columbus having "created in his heart a great flame of desire to do some notable thing," after his father's death. This last account is quoted by Hocklyt from Baptista Ramusius, who gives it upon the authority of Galeacius Butigarius, the Popes legate in Spain, as having been told to him by Sebastian Cabot himself, but this story is set aside by the strongest evidence, which may be found on the same page, purporting to be an extract from the map of Sebastian Cabot, cut by Clement Adams, concerning his discovery of the West Indies, which is to be seen in her majesties "priore gallerie of Westminster, and in many other ancient merchants' houses." "Anno Domino 1497 Ioannes Cobotus Venetus, et Sebastianus illius fillius eam terram fecerunt peruiam, quam nullus prius adire ausus fuit, die 24 Iunj, circiter horam quintam bene mane. Hane autem appellavit terram primum visam, credo quod ex mari in eam partem primum oculos imecerat, etc. This together with the king's patent—"damus et concedimus pro nobis et hœredibus nostris, dilecris nobis Ioanni Caboto civi Venetiarum, Lodovico, Sebastiano, et Sancio, filijs dicti Ioannis, et eorum hœredibus," etc. and again his permission, "tertio die Febuarij, anno 13, licentiam dedit Ioanno Caboto, quod ipse capere possit sex naves Anglicanas, etc." sufficiently prove that John was not dead when Sebastian was seized with a "flame of desire to do some notable thing," and go to discredit the legate of his holiness. For the authority that he was not a Venetian born, but a native of Bristol,—See Bancroft, vol. I. p. 8., note 1,— authority of Eden quoted in his history of Travayles in the East and West Indies, "Sebastian Cabot told me that he was born in Brystow," etc. See also Edward Haies' account of Gilbert's voyage in 1583, in Hacklyt, vol. III. 184. He calls him an "Englishman born." After all it is not wonderful that Sebastian should have carried off most of the credit of this discovery, since he was a young and active mariner, who subsequently distinguished himself not only in England, but in the service of the enterprizing Ch. V. and thus became known all over Europe to seamen and to literary men in the most advantageous light, whilst his father probably died soon after his first expedition to this continent. British voyage to America. In the following year a new patent was given to John Cabot, and the enterprize was conducted by his adventurous and distinguished Feb. 3, 1498. son Sebastian, in this expedition which was undertaken for purposes of trade as well as discovery, several merchants of London* * See Robert Fabians, Chronicle, quoted, Hacklyt III., 30. took part, and even the king himself.† † See memoir of Seb. Cabot, 85, quoted, Bancroft I., 12. Cabot sailed in a north west course, in hopes of finding a north west passage to India, as far probably as the 58th or 60th degree of latitude, until he was stopped by the quantities of ice which he encountered, and the extreme severity of the weather, he then turned his course southward and followed the coast according to some writers to the coast of Virginia, and in the opinion of some as far as the coast of Florida.‡ ‡ The diversity among writers upon these matters is astonishing, Baptista Ramusius in the account quoted above in note †—p. 557 of a conversation held between Galeacius Butigarius, and Cabot himself, makes the latter say "I found the land still continent to the 56 degree under our pole. And seeing that there the coast turned toward the east, despairing to find a passage, I turned back again, &amp;c. and came to that part of the coast which is now called Florida, where my victuals failing, I returned to England, where I found preparation for wars with Scotland, &amp;c. This same Baptista Ramusias says in the preface to the third volume of his navigations, that Sebastian Cabot wrote to him that he sailed beyond the land of New France, at the charge of Henry VII. of England, unto the latitude of 67 degrees and a half under the North Pole, and at the 11th day of June, finding still the open sea without any manner of impediment, he thought to have passed that way to the east, and would have done it, if the mutiny of the shipmaster and mariners had not hindered him, and made him return homeward from that place. In opposition to this Peter Martyr says in the sixth chapter of his hird Decade, that he was stopped by ice—et primo tendens ad septentrionem donec etiam Julio mense vastas repererit glaciales moles pelago natantes, et lucem fere perpetuam, tellure tamen libera, gelu liquefacto: quare COACTUS FUIT uti ait vela vertere et occidentem sequi: tendedit que tantum ad meridiem, ut Herculii freti latitudinis fere gradus æquarit: ad occidentemque profectus tantum est ut Cubam Insulam a læva, longitudine graduum pene parem, habuerit." The author further says "Familiarem habem domi Cabotum ipsum, et contubernalem interdum," from which one would think he ought to know the truth. Francis Lopez de Gomara, a Spaniard, says that Cabot sailed north 58 degrees, and better, that in the month of July, he was stopped by cold and ice, that the days were long, and "in a manner" without any night, and the night they had was very clear, that he sailed west, and south to 38 degrees, and then returned to England. This Spaniard had probably an acquaintance also with Cabot, who resided a long time in Spain, holding the office of Pilot Major.— These last quoted accounts which seem most credible, are followed by Hacklyt, vol. V. p. 283, Bancroft, vol. I. p. 12. Holmes in American Annal's, vol. I. p. 18, does not mention the ice, but supposes him to have gone as far N. as 67° 30′, and S. as the south of Florida, we find upon reference to a note which he makes that he has been struck with the same difficulties with which we have been contending in this, and gets over the difficulty by the extreme age of Cabot at the date of the conversation and the letter, but nothing short of dotage can account for the inconsistences. We see also that he confounds the first and second expeditions of the Cabots by supposing the first was never carried into effect, placing the second in 1497, and supposing it conducted by both John and Sebastian Cabot. This at first seemed plausible as the date of what we have supposed, the second expedition was 13th of Henry VII. and the battle of Bosworth being fought August 22, 1485, the 13th year might seem to embrace June of 1497, but this hypothesis is exploded by reference to the statement that on the 11th of June Sebastian Cabot was at 67° 30′ N. lat. whilst his map states that the first land discovered by John and Sebastian was on the 24th of June, which could not of course have been on the same year. Bancroft's explanation of these difficulties seems best, he supposes another voyage to have been made by S. Cabot from England in the reign of Henry VIII. to the north west coast of America, to which he alluded in his conversation and his letter. This idea is strongly confirmed by his reference to Hacklyt, v. III. p. 591, 2. The only commodities with which he returned to England, as far as our accounts inform us, were three of the natives of the newly discovered countries. He found upon his return, the king immersed in his preparations for a war with Scotland, which prevented his engaging in any further prosecution of his discoveries, or entertaining any design of settlement. It is not our purpose to notice the Portuguese discoveries under Cotereal, the French under Verrazzani and Cartier, or their abortive attempt at settlements in Canada, and New England. Nor shall we notice the extensive inland expedition of the Spaniards under Soto from Florida, through the states of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, across the Mississippi, and into Louisiana,—or the attempts of the French at settlement in Florida, and the Carolinas,—these matters belong rather to the history of the United States, than the sketch of the history of Virginia which we propose to give, we pass at once to the British attempts at colonization in America. The progress of maritime adventure extended rapidly. The evidence exists of several English voyages having been made not only to the coast of North America, but the Levant, the harbors of northern Africa and Brazil. The visits to the fisheries of Newfoundland had become A. D. 1548. frequent, and the commerce from that source had become of such importance, and to have been the subject of such long and oppressive exactions, as to require the action of Parliament for their prohibition. India was still the great object with the merchants, and the discovery of a nearer passage than that offered by the Cape of Good A. D. 1550. Hope, the great desideratum with mariners. The northwestern passage had been attempted thrice by the Cabots in vain, a northeastern expedition was fitted out, and sailed under the command of Willoughby and Chancellor. Willoughby with his ship's company were found in their vessel frozen to death in a Lapland harbor; Chancellor with his vessel entered the port of Archangel, and "discovered" the vast A. D. 1554. empire of Russia, till then unknown to western Europe.— This discovery led to the hope of establishing an intercourse by means of caravans across the continent to Persia, and thence to the A. D. 1568. distant empire of Cathay. Elizabeth afforded every encouragement to the maritime enterprises of her subjects, and especially encouraged the newly established intercourse with Russia. The hope of discovering a north west passage A. D. 1576. was by no means as yet relinquished. Martin Frobisher, after revolving in his mind the subject for fifteen years, believed that it might be accomplished, and "determined and resolved with himself to go and make full proof thereof," "knowing this to be the only thing in the world that was left yet undone, whereby a notable mind might be made famous and fortunate."* * Hacklyt III. 86,—Bancroft I. 92. This latter writer does credit to our country by the extent of his research, the soundness of his judgment, and the beauty of his style, we feel no hesitation in taking his opinions whenever the works he quotes are not accessible, or too numerous and voluminous for us to be able to examine them in our exceedingly limited time. Frobisher was too poor to supply himself with the means of carrying his designs into execution, but after much solicitation at court he was patronized by Dudley, Earl of Warwick, who supplied him with two small barks, the one of twenty and the other of twenty five tons burthen, and a pinnace of ten tons. With this little fleet he set sail, the expedition was entirely unfortunate, one of his barks deserted and returned home, the pinnace went down in a storm, "whereby he lost only four men," with such small vessels and crews did the hardy mariners of that day venture to cross the Atlantic. The Admiral's mast was sprung, and the top mast blown overboard by the same storm in which he lost the pinnace, but nothdaunted, he persevered, and entered Hudson's bay. The only thing accomplished by the voyage was the taking possession of the cold and barren wilderness in the name of Elizabeth, carrying home some of the gravel and stones, one of the latter of which resembling gold, or probably, having some gold artificially mingled with it after it reached London, caused the gold refiners nearly to go mad, and the merchants to undertake one of the wildest expeditions recorded in the annals of discovery; besides this show of gold, which was pronounced very rich for the quantity, the only other acquisition was a poor native, whose simplicity was imposed upon by the most treacherous devices, until he was decoyed to the English vessel, and then seized by force, and carried away from his friends. He bit off his tongue from despair and died soon after his arrival in England from cold taken on the voyage. The mania which the story of the little bit of gold produced in London caused a fleet, of several vessels to be fitted out, of which the A. D. 1577. Queen herself furnished one, to bring home the rich produce of these icy mines,—the ships returned with black earth, but no gold. The spirit of avarice was not to be stopped in her career by a single fallure, a new fleet of 15 vessels was fitted out, and Martin A. D. 1578. Frobisher was given the command, a colony was to be planted for the purpose of working the mines, while 12 vessels were to be sent home with ore. After almost incredible difficulties encountered amidst storms and "mountains of floating ice on every side," the loss of some vessels, and the disertion of others, they reached the northern Potosi, and the ships were well laden with the black earth, but the colonists being disheartened by their hardships declined settling on the coast, and all returned to England,—we are not informed of the value of the proceeds of the cargo. Whilst the British Queen and her merchants were indulging themselves in fancies as brilliant and as evanescent as the icebergs which encumbered the scene of the delusion, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, a man of insuperable energy and fearless enterprize, formed a design of promoting the fisheries, and engaging in useful colonization. With this view he obtained a patent of the same character with most of those which were granted to the early promoters of coloni- June, 11, 1578. zation in Amerieca, conferring unbounded privileges upon the proprietor, and guaranteeing no rights to the colonists. The first expedition in which Gilbert had expended much of his private A. D. 1579. fortune failed, from what cause is uncertain. The second expedition undertaken four years afterwards, was still more unfortunate, for it lost to the world the gallant, and accom- A. D. 1583. plished projector of the expedition. Five vessels sailed from Plymouth on Tuesday the 11th of June 1583; two days afterwards the Vice admiral complained of sickness aboard, and returned with the finest ship in the fleet to Plymouth. The admiral nevertheless continued his course with his little squadron and took possession with the feudal ceremony of Newfoundland, to be held by him as a fief of the crown of England, in accordance with the terms of his charter. The looseness of morals displayed by the mariners of that day is truly disgusting, and increases our wonder at the daring of men who could venture so far from home, in such frail barks, with almost a certainty of encountering on the great highway in their fellow-men, greater perils than were presented by all the terrors of the deep. Robbery by sea was too common, and often committed in violation of the most sacred obligations, even upon persons engaged in the very act of relieving the distress of the depredators.* * See a remarkable instance in Hacklyt, vol. III., 191, 196, &amp;c. Gilbert seems to have been cursed with a remarkably riotous and insubordinate company. The sick and disaffected were left at Newfoundland to be sent home with the Swallow, and the Admiral proceeded with his three remaining barks. On Tuesday the 20th of August they sailed from the harbor of St. John's and on the 29th in about latitude 44 degrees, the largest remaining vessel, by the carelessness of the crew, struck, and went to pieces, and the other barks were forced by a high sea and a lea shore to struggle for their own preservation, which they accomplished with difficulty; alleging at the same time that they could see none of the crew of the wreck floating upon timbers, but all seemed to have gone down, when the ship broke up. A few however escaped to Newfoundland in the ship's pinnace, as was afterwards discovered. This calamity followed by continual storms, in an unknown and shoaly sea, enhanced by an extreme scantiness of provisions, and want of clothes and comforts in the two little barks, which yet remained, induced the Admiral, at the earnest solicitation of his men to return home- * * See a remarkable instance in Hacklyt, vol. III., 191, 196, &amp;c.Aug. 31. wards. Sir Humphrey Gilbert was vehemently persuaded by the crew of the Golden Hind to remain with them during the voyage, but as some malicious taunts had been thrown out by some evil disposed person accusing him of being afraid of the sea, he chose to continue to sail in his little pinnace the Squirrel, which was burthened beyond her strength. After the vessels had left the Azores to the south, and reached the latiitude of England, they encountered violent and continued storms. On Monday the ninth of September the Squirrel was nearly cast away, but recovered, and the Admiral was seen sitting abaft with a book in his hand, and heard to cry out to those in the Hind, "we are as near to heaven by sea as by land." That same night at 12 o'clock, the Squirrel being in advance her light suddenly disappeared, and her hardy crew with their gallant commander sleep forever in the deep. The Hind reached Fal- A. D. Sep. 22. mouth in safety, but after encountering eminent peril to the last moment.† † Hacklyt, III., 184 to 202. The daring spirit of the mariners of that day is amazing. Sir Walter Raleigh, the step brother of Sir Humphrey Gilbert, so far from being intimidated by the melancholy fate of his relative, or disheartened by the unprofitable and disastrous termination of most of the voyages to America, undertook in the very next year, an expedition to the coast March 25, 1584. of the present United States. He easily obtained one of the usual unlimited patents from Elizabeth, and leaving the cold north with its barren snows, its storms, icebergs, and certain evils, together with its imaginary wealth, he spread his sails for the sweet south, where he was sure to find a fertile soil and a delightful climate, though his ship's company might not all be enriched by the discovery of gold. On the second of July they founded shoal water, "and smelt so sweet and strong a smell, as if they had been in the midst of some delicate gar- July 2. den abounding with all kinds of odoriferous flowers." On the thirteenth they entered Ocracock inlet, on the coast of the present state of North Carolina, and landed on Wocoken Island. They July 13. commenced an intercourse with the natives, who proved to be bold, confiding, intelligent and honorable,* * See a very pleasing account of this interesting intercourse in Hacklyt, III. 304, &amp;c. to their friends, but treacherous, revengeful and cruel towards their enemies. The English explored a little the surrounding islands, and bays, and returned home in September, carrying with them two natives, September Manteo and Wanchese. The glowing description given by the adventurers on their return of the beauty of the country, the fertility of the soil, and pleasantness of the climate delighted the Queen, and induced her to name the country of which she had taken possession, Virginia, in commemoration of her unmarried life. It might be expected that so favorable an account would soon lead to a new expedition; accordingly another was prepared for the succeeding 1585. year, consisting of seven vessels. Ralph Lane was appointed by Raleigh, govenor of the colony, which consisted of one hundred and eight persons.† † Bancroft says 108, Robertson 180, Holmes 107. Sir Richard Greenville took command of the fleet, and several learned and accomplished men attended the expedition, one of whom has transmitted to posterity many interesting particulars of the nature, of the country, and the habits, manners, and government of its inhabitants.‡ ‡ Hariot in Hacklyt, III. 324, 40. The English soon began to maltreat the harmless, unpretending, and simple natives, and they on the other hand to grow jealous July 11, 1586. of the power of the overbearing strangers. They soon learned the inordinate passion of the new comers for gold, and taking advantage of their credulity inflicted upon them the labor of many fruitless expeditions in search of pretended mines, hoping at the same time by these divisions to weaken the power of the little colony to such a degree that they might be able to destroy it in detachment; but the English were too cautious for this, and went too short a distance, and in force too powerful for the Indians to encounter, with the great disparity of arms. The greatest advantage which accrued from these expeditions, and indeed from the whole attempt at a settlement, was the discovery of Chesapeake bay. The little colony finding no gold and receiving no supplies from England had begun to despond, when most unexpectedly Sir Francis Drake arrived, on his return from his expedition against the Spaniards, in South America, with a fleet of three and twenty ships. The sagacity of Drake perceived in a moment what was necessary for the colony, and his generosity supplied them with provisions, vessels, and other things necessary to maintain their position, extend their researches, and if necessary to return to England; but the accomplishment of his purpose was defeated by a violent storm which suddenly arose, and nearly wrecked his whole fleet, driving the vessel of provisions intended for the colony to sea, and destroying the vessels which had been set apart, to be left for their use. He would have supplied others, but the colony with their governor at their head, earnestly requesting permission to return to England, he complied with June 19. their wishes. Thus terminated the first English settlement in America. This little colony during its sojourn with the Indians, had acquired something of their fondness for the use of tobacco, and learned to regard it with almost the same superstitious reverence as a powerful medicinal agent. Upon their return they introduced the use of this plant into England, and a weed at first disgusting and nauseating to all who use it, has become gradually the favorite luxury (and indeed with many a necessary of life) of all classes of society and of both the young and the old throughout the world, and this after experience has proven that in most cases it is an injury rather than a benefit to the health. A few days after Lane's departure, an English vessel arrived on the coast with every necessary for the colony, but finding it deserted returned home. Sir Richard Grenville arrived soon after with three ships well furnished with stores, for the colony, but not finding it, he also returned, leaving fifteen men on Roanoke Island, to keep possession in the name of Great Britain.* * Hacklyt III, 323. The genius of Sir Walter Raleigh was not of a nature to A. D. 1587. succumb to slight failures, or ordinary difficulties. The succeeding year another colony was despatched to settle in Virginia, and that they might consider their settlement permanent and Virginia their home, many persons with wives and families were sent. A charter of incorporation was granted for a town to be call- Jan. 7, 1587. ed the City of Raleigh, a name revived in after times in the present metropolis of North Carolina. John White was appointed governor, and with eleven assistants constituted the administration for the control of the colony. Ample provision was made by the noble and liberal proprietor for the comfort of the colonists, and a plentiful stock of instruments of husbandry provided, to enable them to supply their own future wants and establish themselves on the only footing which could possibly be expected to be permanent. The company embarked in April and arrived in July, at the April 26. place where they expected to find the fifteen unfortunate men whom Grenville had left. But their grounds were grown up in weeds, their tenantless dwellings had become the abode of the wild animals of the forest, and their scattered bones blanching in the sun, were the last sad memorials which told their fate to their anxious countrymen. Whether they fell by civil dissentions among themselves, by famine or disease, or were yet more miserably cut off by the overpowering numbers of a savage host, taking advantage of their desolate situation, deprived of sympathy, and destitute of the hope of succour, is one of the mysteries of history which the ken of man may not unravel. The sagacity of Raleigh had directed the new settlement to be made on the shores of the magnificent Chesapeak, and there was the new city to be built, but the naval officer preferring trade with the West Indies, to exploring the coast, left White on Roanoke Island, and compelled him July 23. to establish himself there. The colony soon became involved in difficulties with the natives, partly from accident, and partly from the previously engendered hostility of July 28. some of the tribes. Indeed it would seem impossible a priori, even if we had not unfortunately too much experience of the fact, that two nations, of such different degrees of civilization, manners and habits, with such different designs, could longer remain together in peace, harmony and the footing of equals. It would seem to be the nature of man that the ignorant tribe should be jealous, treacherous and vindictive, that the more civilized, should be greedy, rapacious and overbearing. And when a spirit of suspicion is once excited, the imprudence of a single individual too often involves in a quarrel all of the citizens of the little communities, nothing is extenuated, and nothing is attributed to accident, but suspicion in the injured party supplies the place of malice in the aggressor. These difficulties made the colonists feel more anxiously their dependance upon England, and forced upon them a melancholy foreboding that without frequent and effectual assistance from the mother country, they could not long sustain themselves in a strange and distant land, the natives of which had become bitterly hostile. Under this impression when their last ship was about to depart for England they forced their reluctant Governor by excessive importunity to desert his charge in order that he might lend his personal aid and influence in sending them succour from home. He sailed with the ship but not until after Aug. 27. his daughter Eleanor Dare, the wife of one of the assistant Governors, had presented him with the first white child born on the continent of North America. This child was christened Virginia Dare, and Aug. 18. with her mother was esteemed a sufficient pledge of the exertions of the Governor in aid of the colony, and of his speedy return. White found all England engaged in anxious preparation to meet the threatened Spanish invasion, but this did not prevent the ge- A. D. 1588. nerous Raleigh from despatching him with two ships of supplies for the relief of the colony. But the spirit of gain overcame the spirit of humanity, and even the tender ties of parental affection, April 22. instead of going at once to the colony, he employed himself in taking Spanish prizes, and was at last himself overcome, and rifled, which compelled him to return to England, much to the chagrin of the noble proprietor, and probably the destruction of the neglected colony. The Invincible Armada of Spain had to be overcome, and the safety of England herself to be secured before another effort could be made to succour the little colony at Roanoke, and when this was accomplished, leisure found the noble patron of the enterprise too much impoverished by his previous unprofitable exertions, to fit out at his own expense another expedition. He was obliged to assign an extensive portion of his powers to a company of merchants and others who might carry his schemes into execution, but with his profuse liberality, the active spring which had quickened previous expeditions was gone, the spirit of gain rather than of glory 69 presided over the destinies of infant America, and it was not until another year had elapsed, that White was sent in quest of his sub- A. D. 1590. jects and his daughter. When he arrived the colony was gone, an inscription on the bark of a tree, indicating Croatan as the place whither they had gone, was the last record of their existence seen by a civilized eye. Conjecture has pointed to an amalgamation with the tribe of Hatteras Indians as the history of their destiny, and old Indian traditions and the physical characteristics of that tribe are said to confirm the idea, but whilst humanity may indulge a hope, credulity itself must entertain a doubt of the truth of the hypothesis. White returned to England as soon as he found out that the colony was gone, and Raleigh is said to have sent five several times in vain, to search for his liege-men, but no tidings were ever received of their existence or their fate. Thus terminated the attempts at settlement on the coast of North Carolina, then called Virginia, the scene next opens upon the broad bosom of the "mother of the waters."* * This is the translation usually given of the Indian name "Chesapeak" but Chilly McIntosch, the celebrated Georgia Creek Chief, now removed west of the Mississippi with his tribe, told the writer another meaning which he said was the true one, but which the writer has forgotten; but which was however not so unlike the one given above but that the same word might well convey the two different impressions, in difrent Idioms of the same language. CHAPTER II. SETTLEMENT AT JAMES TOWN—SUFFERINGS OF THE COLONISTS—ADVENTURES OF SMITH. New Company raised—its charter,—James Town,—Machinations against Smith,—Difficulties of the colony,—Smith taken prisoner—his release,— Arrival of Newport—Discovery of earth believed to be gold,—Departure of Newport,—Survey of the Chesapeake and its waters by Smith,— Smith made President,—Second arrival of Newport,—Judicious conduct of Smith,—New Charter,—New arrival of emigrants,—Badness of the selection,—New settlements,—Accident to Smith—his departure, —his character. We have now approached the period in which the British were destined to make a permanent settlement in America. England already possessed a population considered redundant, in consequence of the inadequate means of support afforded by her limited commerce, and inefficient agriculture. The pacific and timid character of James I. threw out of employment many of the brave spirits who had served under Elizabeth, and left them the choice of only two means of acquiring wealth or distinction,—and these were either to draw a mercenary sword in the quarrels of strangers, or to serve their king and country by transplanting their energy and enterprise to a new world. Bartholomew Gosnold chose the latter. He was a person of rank and intelligence, and had already acquired distinction by his courage and skill in arms. He solicited his friends for aid for many years in vain, but at length attracted the attention of the distinguished adventurer Capt. John Smith, Edward Maria Wingfield, a merchant, and Robert Hunt, a clergymen, who after taking a year for reflection entered zealously into his projects. Nothing however could be effected until persons of wealth and distinction could be found to patronise by their favor, and aid by their capital the enthusiasm of the adventurers. Sir Ferdinand Gorges, a man of wealth, rank, and influence, had been informing himself by conversation with several American Indians who had been carried to England by previous voyages, and by every other means in his power of the nature of the country; and from the information he obtained became exceedingly anxious to possess a domain on the western side of the Atlantic. He persuaded Sir John Popham, lord chief justice of England, to unite in his views. Richard Hacklyt, the distinguished compiler of narratives of maritime adventures, and one of the assignees of Raleigh, had not yet relinquished his hopes of a permanent settlement in America, notwithstanding the frequent previous discouraging failures, and cheerfully joined in this new scheme of American colonization. The exertions of these energetic and distinguished individuals speedily raised a company, and procured a charter from King James. As this was the first charter under which a permanent settlement was made, it may be worth attention to notice some of its prominent features. The charter bears date on the tenth of April sixteen April 10, 1606. hundred and six.* * See this charter preserved in Stith,—Henning's Stat. at Large, p. 60, and in T. Rynier. It grants all the country from four and thirty to five and forty degrees of north latitude, and all islands within one hundred miles of the coast. This immense extent of country was divided by the charter between two companies, for the more speedy accomplishment of their purpose,—which have been ever since designated as the London and the Plymouth companies. The London company wished to establish a colony between the 34th and 41st degrees of latitude, and the Plymouth between the 38th and 45th, and the grants were made in conformity to their wishes. But as there was room for collision between the 38th and 41st degree of latitude, the colony which first settled was to possess the land for fifty miles north and south of its location, and the other colony was forbidden to settle within one hundred miles of the colony first planted. Each of the colonies was to be governed by a council of thirteen† † It appears afterwards that only seven were appointed; no reason is assigned for the change. persons, under the management and direction of a council of thirteen in England, which was to regulate both colonies. The council in the colonies were to govern according to laws, ordinances and instructions prescribed by the king himself. The colonies had full power given to search for and work mines, paying to the king a fifth part of the gold and silver obtained, and a fifteenth of the copper; and they were further allowed to coin money to pass current in the colonies. They were also empowered to levy a duty of two and a half per cent upon the property of the king's subjects trading within their limits, and five per cent upon all others so trading, for the use of the colony for twenty one years, and afterwards for the use of the king. Certain articles of necessity were allowed to be carried to the colonies from any part of the king's dominions free of duty for the first seven years; and the colonists and their descendants were to have forever the privileges, franchises, and immunities of native born Englishmen. The English council was to have power to name the persons who were to compose the colonial council, and the latter elected their own president, and supplied vacancies in their own body. The religion of the church of England was established; lands were to descend as at common law; manslaughter, adultery, and dangerous tumults and seditions were to be punished with death. The president and council constituted the supreme tribunal in all cases. The property of the colonists was to continue in joint stock for five years. One hundred and nine years from the discovery of the North American continent by Cabot, three small vessels whose joint tonnage Dec. 19, 1606. amounted to only 160 tons burthen, sailed for the coast of Virginia with a colony of 105 men. They were detained for six weeks in sight of England by adverse winds. The voyage was prosecuted under the command of Captain Newport, who sailed by the old route of the Canaries and the West India Islands; thus consuming the valuable time and provisions of the colonists in a voyage unnecessarily long and circuitous. He did not arrive in the Chesapeake until the 26th of April. Dissensions had sprung up in the course of the voyage, which there was no competent authority to quell, as the absurd affectation of diplomatic mystery on the part of King James had sealed up his instructions and the names of those who were to constitute the council, in a box which was not to be opened until after they arrived in Virginia. The southern cape of the Chesapeake received the name of Henry, and the northern that of Charles, after the names of the sons of James. After landing on cape Henry, the box of instructions was opened, and Smith* * The council named was Bart. Gosnold, John Smith, Edward Wingfield, Christopher Newport, John Ratcliffe, John Martin and George Kendall. was found to be named as one of the council, but he was excluded by the jealous malignity of the rest. Wingfield was chosen President. Soon after passing the capes they reached the mouth of a large and beautiful river which they named after their sovereign James, but which the natives called Powhatan. About fifty miles from the mouth of this river they selected a spot for their settlement, to which they gave May 13. the name of James Town. There could not perhaps be a company more unfitted for the duty which it had to perform than that which now commenced the foundation of the British empire in America. The colonists were in a wilderness surrounded by savages, without a fortification to repel their incursions, possessed of a scanty supply of provisions, without means of planting,—and without a habitation, to protect them from the weather, save such as they might themselves erect; yet in the whole company there were but four carpenters, and twelve laborers, to fifty-four gentlemen. At first however this rare collection of pioneers fell to work with spirit, each to his appropriate duty. The president who seems to have been a very weak man and ill-suited for his station, was too jealous of his own men to allow exercises at arms, or a fortification to be erected; and the only protection provided was a sort of half moon formed of the boughs of trees by the exertions of Kendall. Newport, Smith, and twenty others were sent to discover the head of the river. In six days they arrived at a town called Powhatan, belonging to king Powhatan, situated at the falls of the river, near the site of the present city of Richmond,—they were kindly treated by the Indians. When the expedition returned, they found that James Town had been attacked by the savages, and 17 men wounded, and a boy killed. They were attacked while at work, and their arms out of order; so that the whole were only saved from destruction by the timely aid of the vessels. After this experience of his folly the President permitted the place to be fortified, and the labor necessary to effect this, with so small a force, whilst it was necessary at the same time to guard their workmen by day, to watch by night, to prepare ground for corn, and lumber to relade the ships, may be better conceived than described. After a stay of six weeks, Newport prepared to depart, and the council affecting a tender regard for the character of Smith, whom they had falsely accused of a treacherous design to usurp royal authority in the colony, and kept out of his seat in the council under these charges, now proposed that he might not be utterly ruined by a trial, to send him home to the council to be disposed of as it might think proper. But Smith conscious of innocence of the absurd charge, boldly defied them, and demanded a trial. His accusers suborned witnesses, who instead of answering the expectations of their employers, only exposed the subornation. The company were so incensed at the infamous conduct of his accusers, that they condemned the President to pay him £200, which, when received, he generously threw into the common stock. Newport sailed on the 15th of June, leaving 100 men in Virginia. The condition of the men thus left was the most melancholy that can well be imagined. They consisted for the most part of men entirely unused to labor, or hardship; who were doomed to encounter every kind of difficulty, in the midst of summer, in a hot and sickly climate. In ten days from the departure of Newport scarce ten men could stand from sickness and weakness. The food was scanty in quantity, and of the most unwholesome quality. The allowance of each man was half a pint of wheat, and as much barley, boiled in water, which was served out from a common kettle, and which having been closely stowed in the ship's hold for 26 weeks in a warm and moist atmosphere, was reduced to a condition any thing but tempting. Smith, the narrator of these sufferings, humorously remarks, "If we had been as free from all sins as from gluttony and drunkenness, we might have been canonized for saints." As might be supposed in such an unfortunate state of affairs great mortality prevailed, and fifty were buried between May and September, and those that survived relied principally for their subsistence upon sturgeon and sea crabs. The suffering in this state of affairs must have been greatly aggravated by the knowledge, that the President was indulging himself in every luxury which the stores afforded,—and his detection in an attempt to escape in the pinnace, from the suffering colony. This last act of treachery was more than the little colony could endure, and weak as it was, it deposed him, and Kendall his accomplice. Ratcliffe was made President. The council do not seem to have exercised the power granted them in their charter, of filling up vacancies, and it was now reduced to three,—Ratcliffe, Smith, and Martin; Gosnold had perished, Newport sailed for England, and Wingfield and Kendall had been deposed. The President and Martin being unpopular men, and very deficient in judgment and energy, committed the control of affairs nearly entirely to Smith, who by his example and his skill in managing men, speedily reduced affairs to order, induced the men to work, and provided comfortable habitations. His next object was to obtain a supply of corn for the immediate necessity of the people, which he did effectually by frightening the people of Kecoughtan, an Indian village situated near the site of the present town of Hampton,—after first trying every means to purchase their provision. Smith now constituted the only hope not only for the existence of the colony as such, but for the lives of the individuals of whom it consisted. Their recent wretchedness was not a sufficient warning to them to preserve order, and to husband their resources with prudence, now that plenty was provided, but they lived as wastefully as if they had boundless magazines at command. Smith seeing this, caused the pinnace to be fitted up for a cruise, and in the mean time availed himself of the opportunity to become acquainted with the country lying on the Chickahominy. During one of these temporary absences of Smith, Wing field and Kendall, who had lived in disgrace since they were deposed, laid a plot to carry off the pinnace to England, which the fortunate return of Smith before they had time to effect their purpose, prevented. But not even then were they defeated, without firing on the pinnace, by which means Kendall lost his life. Smith having gained possession of the pinnace, ascended the Chickahominy, and procured an abundance of corn. Winter coming on soon after afforded an ample supply of game, and wild fowl, so that plenty was once more restored, and thought no longer entertained of going to England. Little souls cannot look upon the greatest exploits of nobler creatures, without suffering a captious and jealous malignity to detract from their merit. The very beings whom Smith had preserved by his good conduct, now murmured against him their absurd complaints—because he had not discovered the head of the Chickahominy, although he had returned only to supply them with food. His spirit could not brook reproach, however undeserved, for any thing which was yet possible to be accomplished. He again ascended the Chickahominy as far as was practicable in the pinnace, and leaving it in a position which he supposed to be safe, he advanced yet higher, with two whites and two Indians in a canoe. He left his men with his little boat, and taking only his Indian guide, advanced into the forest with his gun to procure them provision. Unfortunately, in disobedience to his orders, the men in the pinnace went ashore, and one of them was taken by the Indians, who learned from their prisoner whither the Captain had gone. The savages pursued him, and slew the men left with the canoe whilst they slept. They next sought Smith, but found him no easy prey, for tying his guide to his arm as a buckler to keep off their arrows, he defended himself so gallantly that they dare not approach him, until falling accidentally into a marsh, he was at length forced by cold and fatigue to surrender. The savages conducted him to their Chief Opechankanough, king of Pamunkee. Smith endeavored to impress the king with a high idea of his powers, by presenting him with a mariner's compass, explaining its uses, and instructing him in the rudiments of astronomy, by explaining the motion of the earth, its shape, and the motion of the sun, moon and planets; truths which it is difficult to believe he could make the savage comprehend, especially as he had but little knowledge of their language. It is more probable that the king was pleased with the ivory case of the compass, and the mysterious play of the needle, which he could see but not touch, and which moved without an apparent cause. Accordingly, we find when his men had tied Smith to a tree and were about to slay him, the king did not attempt to prevent it by explaining the motion of the earth around the sun, but merely held up the compass, the sight of which, seems to have been sufficient to disarm their wrath. For six or seven weeks Smith was led about in triumph by these simple people, and exhibited to the tribes between the James and Potomac rivers, during the whole of which time he was in hourly apprehension of being put to death, but was generally well treated, and provided with most of the luxuries which their simple state afforded. At length he was brought before their Emperor, Powhatan, who received him with all the formal pomp and state known to his savage court. A long consultation was held by the council there assembled, upon the disposition to be made of him, which terminated unfavorably. He was seized by a number of the savages, and his head laid upon two great stones which had been brought there for the purpose. His executioners had already raised their clubs to dash out his brains, and thus at once end his toil and difficulties, and cut off the only hope of the colony, when an advocate appeared, as unexpected as would have been the appearance of an angel sent immediately from heaven to ask his release. This was Pocahontas, the Emperor's favorite daughter, who generously stepped forth and entreated with tears, that Smith might be spared. And when she found this unavailing with the inexorable judges, she seized his head, and placed it under her own, to protect it from the blows. This sight so moved Powhatan, that he permitted Smith to live, intending to retain him to make trinkets and utensils for his family and himself. But a few days afterwards Powhatan told him they would be friends again, and sent him back to Jamestown, with an offer of a large district of country in exchange for two great guns, and a grindstone, but the party who were to carry these things found them so heavy, and were so much terrified by the effect of the guns when discharged at a tree, that they were well satisfied to return without them, having received a few paltry baubles and trinkets. Smith's return again prevented a party from running off with the pinnace; which so incensed them that they laid a plot to slay him, by a mock trial for the death of the two men he had left in the canoe, and who were slain by the savages, but he was too prompt for the conspirators, whom he seized and kept close prisoners until he had an opportunity of sending them to England for trial. The colony was now only preserved from perishing by the kindness of Pocahontas, who brought ample supplies every four or five days. During this time the little colony had not been forgotten by the company in England, but Newport soon after his return was again despatched in company with another vessel commanded by Francis Nelson, furnished with all things which could be imagined necessary either for the crews or the colonists. Nelson when in sight of Cape Henry was driven by a storm so far to sea, that he was obliged to land in the West Indies to refit and renew his supply of water. Newport arrived without an accident. Before the arrival of this supply Smith had established a regular intercourse with the savages, and bought their provisions at moderate prices, which the high estimation in which he was held by them, and the awe which his name inspired, enabled him to fix for himself. But now the poor colonists were so grateful to the mariners who had come to their relief that they were permitted to trade at such price as they thought proper, by which means it followed in a short time that a pound of copper would not purchase what had before sold for an ounce. Newport thought proper to pay a visit of ceremony to Powhatan, who received the party with great dignity and state. During this visit a contest of wits took place between the two parties in which Powhatan evinced infinitely greater diplomatic skill than Captain Newport, and by working upon his pride was very near consummating a highly advantageous bargain, but he in his turn was out-witted by the ingenuity of Smith, who having passed many bawbles before his eyes, and finding that his attention was attracted by some blue beads, affected to value them exceedingly, and intimated that they were not to be worn except by the greatest personages. This inflamed the desire of the Emperor to such an extent that he cheerfully gave several hundred bushels of corn for a pound or two of these rare jewels, whose beautiful color resembled the pure ether of heaven. The same stratagem was afterwards played off by Smith with equal success upon Opechankanough, king of Pamunkee. Unfortunately when Smith and Newport returned to Jamestown with this new supply, and added it to their former store, it took fire and the greater part was consumed, together with many of their dry thatched dwellings, a portion of their pallisade fortifications, and some of their arms, bedding and apparel. Instead of returning home with all possible expedition Newport remained 14 weeks in the colony, consuming the precious provision which should have been applied to the support of the unfortunate individuals he was to leave behind him. Unfortunately too he had brought out some gold refiners in his ship, who having discovered a glittering earth near Jamestown thought it gold, and all hands were diverted from their useful toil for the purpose of lading his ship with this worthless article. To such an extent did this mania prevail, that Smith says, "there was no talk, no hope, no work, but dig gold, wash gold, refine gold, load gold." Newport having completed his cargo at length returned home. Soon after his departure the Phœnix, the vessel of Nelson, which had been given up for lost arrived, with all his men in safety, and a good stock of provisions, which he freely and fairly gave to the colonists to the extent of his ability. The next subject, for consideration, was the return cargo,—to obtain which the President wished Smith to examine the commodities to be found in the country above the falls,—others wished the lading to be of the same gold with which Newport was freighted,—but Smith more prudent than either succeeded in loading the Phœnix with cedar, which was the first available cargo sent from Virginia to England. Smith accompanied the Phœnix as far as Cape Henry in a small open barge with 14 men, with which equipment he proposed to ac- June 2, 1608 complish his long cherished object of exploring the Chesapeak and its tributary waters. It is not our purpose to follow him through his two wonderful voyages, undertaken for this purpose, but we will merely present an outline of his course from the pen of an able modern author,* * Bancroft, Hist. U. States, vol. I. p. 149. from whom we have before quoted. "Two voyages, made in an open boat, with a few companions, over whom his superior courage, rather than his station as a magistrate, gave him authority, occupied him about three months of the summer, and embraced a navigation of nearly three thousand miles. The slenderness of his means has been contrasted with the dignity and utility of his discoveries, and his name has been placed in the highest rank with the distinguished men, who have enlarged the bounds of geographical knowledge, and opened the way by their investigations for colonies and commerce. He surveyed the bay of the Chesapeake to the Susquehannah, and left only the borders of that remote river, to remain for some years longer the fabled dwelling place of a giant progeny. The Patapsco was discovered and explored, and Smith probably entered the harbor of Baltimore. The majestic Potomac, which at its mouth is seven miles broad, especially invited curiosity and passing beyond the heights of Mount Vernon and the City of Washington, be ascended to the falls above Georgetown. Nor did he merely explore the river and inlets. He penetrated the territories, established friendly relations with the native tribes, and laid the foundation for future beneficial intercourse. The map which he prepared and sent to the company in London is still extant, and delineates correctly the great outlines of nature. The expedition was worthy the romantic age of American history." The map is indeed astonishingly accurate, we cannot forbear adding the corroborating testimony of the distinguished Robertson* * See Robertson's Hist. of Va. p. 71. upon this subject, which is also quoted and approved by Marshall.† † Marshall's Introduction to life of Washington, p. 41. "He brought with him an account of that large portion of the American continent now comprehended in the two provinces of Virginia and Maryland, so full and exact, that after the progress of information and research for a century and a half, his map exhibits no inaccurate view of both countries, and is the original upon which all subsequent descriptions have been formed." When Smith returned to Jamestown be found that little had been done, and a whole summer, which was a season of plenty, was Sept. 7, 1608. wasted in idleness by the folly and imbecility of the President whose conduct was so outrageous that the company had been at last forced to depose and imprison him. Smith was now elected President, and his energetic conduct speedily brought affairs into good order, and repaired as far as possible the Sept. 10. injuries occasioned by the misconduct of his predecessor. Soon after Smith's election Newport again arrived, with the preposterous order, supposed to have been procured by his own representations, not to return without a lump of gold, discovery of a passage to the south sea, or one of the lost company sent out by Sir Walter Raleigh. He also absurdly brought some costly articles for the royal household of Powhatan, which served only to inflate the pride, without conciliating the affection of that Prince. Some Poles and Dutchmen were also brought for the purpose of manufacturing, pitch, tar, glass, ashes, &amp;c. which would have been well enough if the colony had been in a condition always to defy famine, but which it was impossible to accomplish now, when every man's exertions were necessary to procure a sufficiency of food. Notwithstanding Smith's remonstrances, Newport insisted upon his trip of discovery above the falls of James river, for the purpose of discovering a rout to the south sea, although Powhatan had assured them that the story they had heard of there being a sea in that direction was utterly false. The party returned as Smith had predicted, disappointed and disheartened. Since this project had failed 70 Smith having first procured a supply of provisions which Newport and the rest with all their vain boasting and their costly presents had failed to do, and knowing that it was as impossible to find a lump of gold, or one of Raleigh's company as it was to find the south sea on James river, set himself to work to supply a cargo of tar, pitch, boards, ashes and such articles as they had it in their power to procure, although with great difficulty and labor. So effectually did he exert himself and so much authority had he acquired over the delicate gentlemen under his controul, whose tender hands blistered with the use of the axe, that in a short time he had provided a sufficient cargo, for Captain Newport, who at length departed, leaving two hundred souls in the colony. By the return of the vessel Smith wrote to the council a letter detailing the cause of their mishaps, assuring them that they need not expect a sudden acquisition of wealth, and that nothing was to be obtained but by labor. He complained of the want of judgment and economy in the expenditure for the benefit of the colony, which prevented them from reaping an advantage of greater value than a hundred pounds judiciously expended would purchase, from an actual outlay by the company of two or three thousand. He also especially complained of the habits and character of the men sent out, and ntrated them when they sent again, rather to send "but thirty carpenters, husbandmen, gardeners, fishermen, blacksmiths, masons and diggers up of tree-roots, well provided, than a thousand such as they had, for unless they could both lodge and feed them, they would perish with want before they could be made good for any thing." From the departure of the ship, until the next arrival the men were only preserved from perishing by the most active and unremitting A. D. 1609. exertions of their President, the detail of whose conduct in his intercourse with the savages, and his management of the ill-assorted, disorderly, turbulent spirits under his controul, is one of the most interesting stories in history, and proves him to have been a man of extraordinary abilities. Although the fond anticipations of the Virginia company had been entirely disappointed, a spirit seems to have prevailed, which was rather disposed to surmount all difficulties by increased exertion, than to succumb to the accumulated misfortunes which had already been encountered. The company seemed to have perceived their error in expecting a sudden acquisition of wealth from their American possessions; and the defects in the government established by the first charter. To remedy these evils a new charter* * See Stith and Henning. was obtained, in which many individuals, May 23, 1609. and corporate bodies were included, of great wealth, power and reputation. By the new charter the power which had before been reserved by the king was now transferred to the company itself; which was to have the power of choosing the supreme council in England, and of legislating in all cases for the colony. The powers of the governor were enlarged from those of a mere president of the council, to supreme and absolute, civil and military controul; the instructions and regulations of the supreme council being his only guide or check. There can be no doubt but that this was the only practicable government which could be offered to a colony in the situation and composed of the materials which then existed in Virginia. The members of the council had only been so many petty tyrants,—the indolent and weak thwarting the exertions of the industrious and the intelligent, and the cowardly and factious disputing the authority, and impugning the motives of such as were brave and honorable. In truth whenever any thing good had thus far been done it was by the exercise of absolute authority by a mind superior to the rest, and whatever had gone wrong might with truth be attributed almost as much to the opposing views of the various members of the council, as to the disposition of some to do wrong. Lord De La Ware received the appointment of governor for life under the new charter, and an avarice which would listen to no possibility of defeat, and which already dreamed of a flourishing empire in America, surrounded him with stately officers, suited by their titles and nominal charges to the dignity of an opulent kingdom. The condition of the public mind favored colonization; swarms of people desired to be transported; and the adventurers with cheerful alacrity contributed free-will offerings. The widely diffused enthusiasm soon enabled the company to despatch a fleet of nine vessels, containing more than five hundred emigrants.* * Bancroft U. S. I., p. 153 and authorities there quoted. Newport was made Admiral, and was joint commissioner with Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George Somers to administer the affairs of the colony until the arrival of the governor. But these three individuals, with a ceremonious punctilio characteristic of little minds, seeling that distinction from artificial positions in society, which they cannot obtain by their own merit, could not agree in a contest for precedence, and hence were compelled as a compromise, all to go in the same ship. Thus exposing the colony to all the danger of anarchy rather than that one should appear by the ship he occupied to be a greater man than the other. They accordingly embarked with their commission, their directions and much of the provision in the Sea Venture. When near the coast of Virginia they encountered a violent storm which destroyed one small vessel, and drove the Sea Venture so far to sea that she stranded on the rocks of the Bermudas. Seven ships arrived in safety. When Smith heard of the arrival of this immense fleet, he at first supposed it belonged to Spain and was sent to take possession of the colony, he accordingly made all things ready with his usual promptness and energy of character, to give them a warm reception, and little fear was entertained of the result. Smith had by this time by his good conduct brought the savages so completely into subjection by their admiration for his qualities and fear of his power, that they had become subjects and servants, planting and working for him as he required; and now when it was thought he was about to be attacked by the Spaniards they lent him all the aid in their power. The company in England had not attended to the wise advice of Smith in the selection of their colonists, for it must be remarked that he had no friend at home, whilst his enemies were suffered there to make their own representations. In the new batch of officers Ratcliffe and Archer were sent back, who had been sent home in disgrace for their idle, dissolute and mutinous conduct. They prejudiced the minds of the other officers so much against Smith, on the voyage, that they hated him mortally before they had seen him. The historian of the times regrets that the fleet was not composed of Spaniards instead of Englishmen, and thinks it would have been better for the colony.* * "Had it so been we had been happy; for we would have trusted them but as our foes, where receiving them as our countrymen and friends, they did what they could to murthur our President, to surprise the store, the fort, and our lodgings, to usurp the government, ard make us all their servants and slaves, till they could consume us and our remembrance; and indeed rather to supplant us than supply us, as master William Box, an honest gentleman in this voyage relateth."—"Narrative of William Potts, clerk of the councell, William Tankard and G. P." in Smith's Hist. of Va. pa. 243. The newly imported "unruly gallants, packed hither by their friends to escape ill destinies," taking sides with Ratcliffe, Archer and their confederates against the President, whose commission they affected to consider as having been superceded by the new commission, conducted themselves very riotously, and refused to remain in subordination to any authority. Smith bore this for some time patiently, expecting every moment the arrival of the new commission, and wishing when that event happened to depart for England, and leave the scene of his great sufferings and glorious exertions; being willing to quit the service of a company who could so unceremoniously dispense with his authority for the purpose of putting individuals over him who had no claims upon them, and who knew nothing of the management of the colony. Fortunately the commissioners had been stranded and did not arrive, and Smith could no longer suffer affairs to remain in confusion. After his resolution was taken he quickly laid by the heels the most factious, who had been perpetually plotting his destruction and engaging in all kinds of mischief, until he could have leisure to do them justice. The number still remaining at large in James Town being too great for that position, and more than could be well supported or easily managed,— he despatched West with a hundred and twenty of the best men he could select to form a settlement at the falls; and Martin with nearly as many more to Nansemond; providing them with a fair proportion of food and other necessary articles. Martin managed badly;—his jealous fears induced him to attack the savages in his neighborhood who had treated him well, and take possession of a large quantity of their corn and other property,—whilst his cowardly caution or criminal tenderness permitted them to rally and in their turn attack his men with impunity, to kill and wound several and retake all they had lost. He sent to James Town for a reinforcement, which he did not employ when he received, but hastened thither himself, cowering under the protection of Smith's prowess, and leaving his men to their fate. The President set out for the falls a few days after West had departed, and found that he had located himself in an exceedingly inconvenient station, subject to inundation, and surrounded by other intolerable inconveniences. He offered a fair proposition to Powhatan, for the purchase of his place called Powhatan, which he was willing to accept, but the disorderly spirits he had sent thither, who were dreaming that the country immediately above them was full of gold, to which they wished no one to have access but themselves, refused the place, or to ratify the contract, despising alike his kindness and his authority. The President with his five men went boldly among them, and seized the ringleaders of the mutiny, but the whole number of a hundred and twenty gathering in upon him, forced him to retire, but not without seizing one of their boats, with which he took possession of the hip, in which their provision was lodged. Fortunately for Smith he was sustained by the mariners who had learned his character from his old soldiers, and their own observations of his conduct, as well as by several of the officers who had learned the error of their first prejudices, deserted his adversaries, and become his firm friends. The Indians came to Smith, whom they considered as their friend and protector, complaining bitterly of the maltreatment of the party at the falls, stating that they were worse than their old enemies the Monocans, from whom it was the duty of the party to protect them, and seeing their turbulent disobedience, they offered their aid to chastise them. Smith remained nine days longer trying to heal these differences, and to convince them of the absurdity of their "guilded hopes of the South sea mines." But finding all in vain he set out for James Town. Such visionary and disorderly persons were the first civilized inhabitants of the present polished, intelligent and hospitable city of Richmond. No sooner was Smith's voyage commenced down the river, than the savages attacked those he left behind him, and slew many and so frightened the rest that they suffered the prisoners they held in custody to escape. The terrified wretches fled for safety to Smith, whose ship had grounded, and submitted without stipulation to his mercy. He seized six or seven of the ringleaders, and imprisoned them; the rest he placed in the savage fort Powhatan, which from the beauty of its position, the excellence of its houses and fortifications, and other advantages, was called Non-such. He also satisfied the savages. This fair prospect was again marred by the imbecility of West, who listened to the deceitful tales, and whining entreaties of the prisoners, and released them, which again threw all things into disorder; the evil disposed being the more encouraged in their mutinous conduct now by the possession of their provisions and stores which had been returned to them at the time of their previous submission. They abandoned Non-such and returned to their former inconvenient station at West's fort. Smith finding it impossible to restore tranquility, again set sail down the river. In his progress an unfortunate accident occurred which deprived the colony of his services, and was near depriving him of life. His powder bag accidentally exploded whilst he was sleeping, and tore the flesh from his body and thighs in a horrible manner. The pain was so acute that he threw himself into the river to cool the burning sensation, and was near drowning before he could be recovered. He had yet to go nearly one hundred miles in this situation before he could reach a surgeon, or have any soothing application applied to his wound. When he returned to James Town, the time for the trial of Ratcliffe and Archer was approaching, and these worthies fearing the result, hired an assassin to murder him in his bed, but the heart of the wretch failed him, ere he could fire the fatal shot. Failing in this, their next hope was to save their lives by possessing themselves of the government, but in this they were disappointed by Smith, who having in vain urged all those he thought most worthy to accept the Presidency, resigned it to Mr. Percy, who was about to sail for England but was induced to stay under the present embarrassing circumstances, to prevent the supreme control of the colony from falling into the hands of the miscreants who aspired to it. Smith finding himself disabled by his wound, the pain of which almost deprived him of his reason, and seeing that there was not sufficient surgical skill in the colony to restore him, determined to depart for England He well knew that in his disabled state the colony was no place for him, for it had required his utmost exertion in health to suppress faction at home, keep the Indians in awe, and by the most unceasing activity supply the colony with provision. He departed under the most mortifying circumstances;—"his commission was suppressed he knew not why, himself and soldiers to be rewarded he knew not how, and a new commission granted they knew not to whom." After his determination was known the ships which were to have departed the next day were retained three weeks, whilst the mutinous captains were perfecting some colorable charge to send home against him. Never had the colony sustained such a loss. His conduct and his character will be best given in the language of those who knew him best. A writer who was with him in his troubles speaking of the attempt to usurp the government immediately before his departure, says:— "But had that unhappy blast not happened, he would quickly have qualified the heat of those humors, and factions, had the ships but once left them and us to our fortunes; and have made the provision from among the savages, as we neither feared Spaniard, savage, or famine; nor would have left Virginia nor our lawful authority, but at as dear a price as we had bought it and paid for it. What shall I say but thus, we left him, that in all his proceedings, made justice his first guide, and experience his second, even hating baseness, sloth, pride, and indignity, more than any danger,—that never allowed more for himself, than his soldiers with him; that upon no danger would send them where he would not lead them himself;—that would never see us want what he either had, or could by any means get us;—that would rather want than borrow, or starve than not pay;—that loved action more than words, and hated falsehood and covetousness worse than death; whose adventures were our lives, and whose loss our deaths." CHAPTER III. PROGRESS OF THE COLONY—MASSACRE OF 1622—DISSOLUTION OF THE LONDON COMPANY. State of the colony at Smith's departure,—its conduct and consequent sufferings,—Arrival of Gates—of Lord De La Ware,—his departure. Arrival of Dale,—Martial law,—Gates Governor,—Grants of land to individuals,—New charter,—Marriage of Pocahontas,—Friendly relations with the Indians,—Subjection of Port Royal and Manhattan,—Cultivation of Tobacco,—Tenure of lands,—Tyranny of Argall, —Propriety of reform in the government,—Yeardley Governor,—First colonial assembly in 1619,—Introduction of women,—Introduction of negroes by the Dutch in 1620,—Constitution brought over by Sir Francis Wyatt.—Relations with the Indians,—Massacre of the 22d. of March, 1622,—its consequences,—Struggles between the king and the company,—Commissioners sent to Virginia,—Firmness of the Virginians,—Dissolution of the company. When Smith left the colony, it contained four hundred and ninety odd persons. The harvest was newly gathered and there was provision for ten weeks in the stores. The savages were in a good state of subjection and readily yielded at a reasonable price whatever they could spare. All things were in such a condition that prudent management might have insured the most brilliant success, but the wildest confusion and anarchy prevailed. The new President was so ill that he could not attend to business, and twenty others endeavored to hold the reins of government. When the savages found that Smith was gone they speedily attacked and broke up the establishments at Powhatan and Nansemond, driving in the remnant of the men their butcheries left, to subsist upon the rapidly wasting provisions of James Town. Ratcliffe with a vessel and thirty men attempting to trade with Powhatan was by his carelessness cut off, and he himself with all his company perished except two, who were saved by the humanity of Pocahontas. West with a crew of thirty escaped in a ship to become pirates.* * Smith in book 4, pa. 2, says, "sailed for England."—Bancroft 156, says on the authority of Stith—"became pirates." The miserable company now left without control or authority, and composed with a few exceptions of "gentlemen, tradesmen, servingmen, libertines, and such-like, ten times more fit to spoil a commonwealth, than either begin one, or but help to maintain one," now gave free rein to all their evil dispositions. Each one sought only to gratify his passions or preserve his own life, without regard to the wants or sufferings of the rest. There was no union, no concert, no harmony. Vice stalked abroad in her naked deformity, and her handmaids, misery and famine followed in her train. The savages attacked and slew the whites upon every occasion, and forming a systematic plan to starve the remainder, they would supply no further provisions; after they had bought every disposable article at the fort, even to most of their arms, at such a price as they chose to exact. The corn was speedily consumed, next followed the domestic animals, poultry, hogs, goats, sheep, and finally the horses; all were consumed even to their skins. The only resource was in roots, acorns, berries, and such other unwholesome stuff as could be found; nay so pinching was the hunger, that savages who had been slain and buried were disinterred to be consumed, and even some of the whites who had perished were used to preserve life by the rest. Of nearly five hundred that Smith left, in six months only sixty emaciated beings remained alive; and these were without the possibility of support for longer than ten days. When Gates and Summers were shipwrecked on the Bermuda rocks, their good management saved the life of every individual, and a large proportion of their provision and stores. On this island although uninhabited, nature was so bountiful, and presented spontaneously such a rich variety of productions suitable to the sustenance of man, that their hundred and fifty men lived in ease and abundance for nearly ten months. The disagreeable idea of remaining thus upon an island, cut off from all intercourse with the rest of the world, stimulated them to the exertion necessary to build two barks, with such rude instruments as they possessed, from the wreck of their old ship and the cedars of the island. In these they embarked for Virginia, expecting to find in the comforts and plenty of a flourishing colony ample solace for all their toil and difficulties. What then was their astonishment when they reached James Town, after a May 23. more prosperous voyage than they could have expected in their crazy vessels, to meet instead of the warm and joyful welcome of their countrymen, in the full fruition of health and plenty, only the greedy cravings of a few miserable wretches, begging for a sufficiency of food to preserve their existence. Not anticipating this melancholy situation they had only provided themselves with enough provision for their voyage, and were unable to releive the necessities of their fellow creatures, whose sufferings it was so painful to witness. It was impossible in this situation to remain longer in the colony. All were embarked on board the vessels, James Town was abandoned, and it was with difficulty that its departing citizens could be prevented from setting fire to the habitations in which they had suffered so much misery. All the provisions which could be raised did not amount to more than would support them for sixteen days, at the most limited allowance, yet with this they set out with the hope to reach Newfoundland, where they expected to be relieved by the British fishing vessels. But although it had been the will of heaven to permit the colonists to receive an awful chastisement for their misconduct, yet it was not decreed by the ruler of all human affairs that the colony should be entirely abandoned, and so much labor and suffering be useless to mankind, or so fine a country left in its original wild and unimproved condition. Before Gates and his associates had reached the mouth of James river, they were met by Lord De La Ware with three ships, having on board a number of new settlers, an ample stock of provisions, and every thing requisite for defence or cultivation. By persuasion and authority he prevailed upon them to return to James Town, where they found their fort, and June 10, 1610, houses and magazines in the same situation in which they had been left. A society with so bad a constitution and such a weak and disordered frame required skillful and tender nursing to restore it to vigor. Lord De La Ware was fully competent to his station. He held a long consultation to ascertain the cause of the previous difficulties, and concluded after listening to their mutual accusations, by a speech full of wholesome advice, recommending the course they should pursue, and assuring them that he should not hesitate to exercise his lawful authority in punishing the insubordinate, dissolute, and idle. By unwearied assiduity, by the respect due to an amiable and benificent character, by knowing how to mingle severity with indulgence, and when to assume the dignity of his office, as well as when to display the gentleness natural to his own temper, he gradually reconciled men corrupted by anarchy, to subordination and discipline, he turned the attention of the idle and profligate to industry, and taught the Indians again to reverence and dread the English name. Under such an administration, the colony began once more March 28, 1611, to assume a promising appearance; when, unhappily for it, a complication of diseases brought on by the climate obliged Lord De La Ware to quit the country: the government of which he committed to Mr. Percy.* * Robertson's Virginia, pa. 80. The colony at this time, consisted of about two hundred men; but the departure of the governor was a disastrous event, which produced not only a despondency at James Town, but chilled the zealous warmth of the London company, and caused a decided reaction in the popular mind in England, which was exhibited in the manner in which popular feeling delights to display itself, by exhibiting the Virginia colony as a subject of derision upon the stage.† † Bancroft, 150. Before the departure of Lord De La Ware the company in England had despatched Sir Thomas Dale with supplies, and it was well he arrived so soon, for the company was already fast relapsing to their May 10, 1611. former state of idleness and improvidence, and had neglected to plant corn; which he caused to be done immediately. The company having found all their previous systems of government inefficient, granted to Sir Thomas Dale more absolute authority than had been granted to any of his predecessors, impowering him to rule by martial law; a short code of which founded on the practice of the armies in the low countries, the most rigid school at that time in Europe, they sent out with him. This system of violent and arbitrary government was recommended by Sir Francis Bacon, the most enlightened philosopher, and one of the most eminent lawyers of his age. It proves the depth of his sagacity, for it would have been absurd to apply the refined speculative theories of civil government to a set of mutinous, undisciplined, idle, ignorant creatures, shut up in a fort, surrounded by hostile nations, and dependent upon their own exertions for support. Surely in such a case a strong government was as necessary as in a ship at sea, and more so than in ordinary military stations, where habitual discipline preserves order, and ensures respect to the officers. The governor who was now entrusted with this great but necessary power exercised it with prudence and moderation. By the vigor which the summary mode of military punishment gave to his administration, he introduced into the colony more perfect order than had ever been established there; and at the same time he tempered its vigor with so much discretion, that no alarm seems to have been given by this innovation. In May Sir Thomas Dale wrote to England full information of the 71 weakness of the colony, but recommending in strong terms the importance of the place. His favorable representations were fully confirmed by Lord De La Ware and Sir Thomas Gates. The hopes of the company were resuscitated, and in August, Gates arrived at James Town with six ships, and three hundred emigrants. The colony which now consisted of seven hundred men, was surrendered into the hands of Gates, and Dale by his permission made a settlement with three hundred and fifty chosen men upon a neck nearly surrounded by the river, which in honor of Prince Henry, he called Henrico. One of the greatest checks to industry which had hitherto existed in the colony was the community of property in the provisions and stores. The idle and dissipated seeing that they were to have a full share, had no stimulus to exertion, and the industrious were disheartened by seeing the larger portion of the fruits of their industry consumed by the idle members of the little society. So discouraging was this state of things to exertion, that frequently in the best times, the labor of thirty did not accomplish more than was done under a different system by three. Gates perceived the evil and applied the remedy. He distributed a certain portion of land to each individual to be worked for his own benefit, still paying however a small portion of his produce to the general store to provide against contingencies. This policy was found so advantageous that every encouragement was afforded to individual enterprize in the acquisition of wealth. But little respect was paid to the rights of the Indians, for some depredation or injury from the tribe of Apamatuck, they were dispossessed of their corn and their cabins, which "considering the position commodious" were unceremoniously appropriated by the English to their own benefit. The colony now having extended considerably, assumed a more regular form by pursuing a more consistent system of policy; and March 12, 1612 beginning to promise permanency, a new charter was granted by James. This confirmed and enlarged all the privileges and immunities which had been proviously granted, extended the time of exemption from duties, and enlarged their territory and jurisdiction to all islands and seats within three hundred miles of the coast. This included the newly discovered, fertile Bermudas, which were soon after sold by the company to one hundred and twenty of its members.* * Holme's Am. An. I. 175. This new charter made some changes in the constitution of the company, by giving more power to the company itself and less to the council, it also conferred the power of raising money by lottery for the benefit of the colony, which was the first introduction of this pernicious system of taxation into England, and which was soon after prohibited by act of March 1621 Parliament, but not until the company had raised nearly thirty thousand pounds by the privilege. As the new system of policy had increased the independence and preserved the numbers of the colony, so had it increased its strength, and the respect of the savages. One powerful tribe now voluntary sought British protection and became British subjects, another was brought to a close and friendly alliance by a tenderer tie than fear could afford. Captain Argall in a voyage to the Potomac for the purpose of purchasing corn, fell in with an old chief named lapazaws, to whom Powhatan had entrusted Pocahontas, which he disclosed to Argall, and offered to sell her to him for a copper kettle. The bargain was made, and Pocahontas being enticed on board by the cunning of her guardian, was carried off without once suspecting the treachery of the old hypocrite. The authorities at Jamestown availed themselves of the possession of this lucky prize to endeavor to extort from Powhatan a high ransom, but the old Emperor though he really loved his daughter, seemed to be so highly affronted at the indignity offered him, that he preferred fighting those who had robbed him of his daughter to purchasing her freedom. But whilst this matter was in agitation a treaty of a different character was going forward between the young princess herself and Mr. Rolfe, a highly respectable young gentleman of Jamestown, who struck by her beauty, and fascinated by her manners so far superior to the rest of her race, wooed and won her affections and obtained a promise of her hand. The news of this amicable adjustment of all difficulties soon reached the ears of Powhatan, and met with his cordial approbation. He sent the uncle and two brothers of Pocahontas to witness the nuptial ceremonies at Jamestown, which were solemnized with great pomp, according to the rites of the English church. From this marriage several of the most highly respected families in Virginia trace their descent. Happy would it have been for both races, if this amalgamation had been promoted by other instances, but this is the only case upon record. This marriage secured the permanent friendship of Powhatan and all under his influence, and the Chickahominies, his next neighbors, when they heard of it, sent deputies, and submitted by solemn treaty to become subjects to king James, and to submit to his governor in the colony,—to pay tribute,— and furnish men to fight against whatever enemies should attack the colony; only stipulating that at home they should continue to be governed by their own laws. No better evidence could exist of the opinion which the colony entertained at this time of its own stability and power, than the fact that they 1613. sent two successive expeditions under Captain Argall to the French settlements at Port Royal, in Acadia which he effectually succeeded in destroying. This was done in a time of profound peace between the two nations, and the only semblance of right is afforded in the prior discovery of the contment by Cabot, for the French settlement was beyond the limits of the Virginia charter. As Argall returned he stopped at the port of New York, and forced Hendrick Christiaens, the governor of the Dutch colony there located, to become a subject of the crown of England, and submit to the authority of its representative the governor of Virginia, and to pay tribute. When Argall was gone, the Dutchman no doubt smoked his pipe and pursued his trade as composedly as he had before, for no use was ever made of this conquest. We have already mentioned a partial distribution of lands by Sir Thomas Dale, for the purpose of encouraging individual industry; it may be well to explain more in detail the tenure by which lands were held by individuals. At the favored Bermudas plantation, near the mouth of the Appomattox, either on account of the greater merit, longer service, or some favorable circumstances attending the expense of the emigration of the tenants, the lands were held by a rent of two and a half barrels of corn annually to the general stock, and one months' service, which was not to be in time of sowing, or of harvest. Those who had been brought over at the expense of the company, had three acres of land allotted them and two bushels of corn from the public store, and with this scanty allowance were required to support themselves by one month's labor; the other eleven being required by the company. This species of laborers had decreased in 1617 to fifty four, including all classes; and these were finally released entirely from their vassalage by Sir George Yeardly in 1617. The original bounty to emigrants, coming at their own expense, or that of others than the company, had been one hundred acres of land, but after the colony became better settled it was reduced to fifty, the actual occupancy of which gave a right to as many more. The payment of twelve pounds and ten shillings to the treasurer of the company, entitled the adventurer to a grant of one hundred acres, the occupancy of which also secured a right to as many more.* * Smith, Book IV. pa. 18. Bancroft I. 167,—Burke. The labor of the colony which had been for a long time misdirected in the manufacture of ashes, soap, glass and tar in which they could by no means compete with Sweden and Russia, and also in planting vines which require infinite labor and attention, and for which subsequent experiments have indicated the climate to be unfit; was at length directed by the extended use of tobacco, in England† † Note by Robertson,—"It is a matter of some curiosity to trace the progress of the consumption of this unnecessary commodity. The use of tobacco seems to have been first introduced into England about the year 1586. Possibly a few sea-faring persons may have acquired a relish for it by their intercourse with the Spaniards previous to that period; but it could by no means be denominated a national habit anterior to that date. Upon an average of the seven years immediately preceding the year 1622, the whole import of tobacco into England amounted to a hundred and forty two thousand and eighty five pounds weight. Stith p. 246. From this it appears, that the taste had spread with a rapidity which is remarkable. But how inconsiderable is that quantity to what is consumed now in Great Britain!" or now! almost exclusively to the cultivation of that article. This commodity always finding a ready price, and affairs 1615. being now so regulated that each one could enjoy the fruits of his labor, was cultivated so assidiously, as to take off the attention of the planters too much from raising corn, so that it became scarce, and supplies had again to be looked for from England or purchased of the Indians. The fields, gardens, public squares, and even the streets of Jamestown were planted with tobacco, and thus becoming an article of universal desire it became to a great extent the circulating medium of the colony. Not only private debts but salaries and officers' fees were paid in tobacco, and the statute book to this day rarely mentions the payment of money, that it does not add as an equivalent "or tobacco." Early in the year 1614 Sir Thomas Gates had returned to England leaving the colony, which then consisted of about four hundred men, under the command of Sir Thomas Dale, who in his turn desiring to visit England and his family, left the colony in 1616 under the protection and control of Sir Thomas Yeardley. With Dale, Mr. Rolfe and his interesting bride Pocahontas sailed. By a communication from Smith her amiable and valuable conduct was made known at court, and every attention was shown her both by the Queen and many of the nobility. This excellent Princess, whose deportment was so far superior to that which the condition of her face would authorize one to expect, that it won for her universal admiration and esteem, was destined never more to behold her father or her native land. She died at Gravesend, where she was preparing to embark with her husband and child for Virginia. Peace to her gentle spirit, her memory will not perish whilst the commonwealth of Virginia endures, or noble and generous actions are valued by her sons. Yeardley's administration was similar to that of his predecessors, enforcing obedience from his own men, and the respect of the savages. He was succeeded in 1617 by Captain Argall, who was a rough seamen, accustomed to the despotic sway of his own ship, naturally tyrannical in his disposition, cruel and covetous, in short a person utterly unfit to be trusted with the administration of the arbitrary government which then existed in Virginia. For although we have considered such a government the only practicable one which could have been then established, yet it required the utmost firmness in the governor, tempered by mildness, prudence and discretion to make it tolerable. Such had been the case under the administration of Gates, Dale and Yeardley, and under them the colony had prospered more than it had ever done before, but such was not the disposition of this new governor. Instead of holding the severity of the laws in terrorem over them, and not actually resorting to the extent of his power except in cases of extreme necessity, he sought to bring innocent actions within the letter of the law, which indeed was not very difficult with the bloody military code which then existed. These arbitrary exertions of power were principally used in the gratification of his inordinate rapacity, which in its indiscriminate grasp sought not only to clutch the property of the colonists, but also trespassed upon the profits of the compnay. Not satisfied with perverting the labor of the free colonists to his own use or pleasures, he consumed the time of the servants of the company upon his own plantations. At length his conduct was so flagitious in the case of one Brewster, who was left by Lord Delaware to manage his estate, and who only sought to prevent Argall from utterly despoiling 1, that neither the colony or company could bear his tyranny longer, but he was deposed and Sir George Yeardley sent in his place. Yet he contrived to escape punishment, by the mismanagement of some, and the connivance of others, and preserved all of his ill-gotten booty. One of the first acts of Yeardly was to emancipate the remaining servants of the colony. The labor now being free, each man enjoying 1619. the fruits of his own industry and anxious to increase his store, there was no fear of scarcity, and no time or opportunity for mutiny among the scattered and industrious planters. With the increasing strength and independence* * The savages now sometimes purchased corn of the English, instead of supplying them as formerly. of the colony all fear of the savages had vanished. It is manifest that in these altered circumstances a modification of the despotic government ought to have been made, because its severity was no longer necessary, and whilst the power existed it might be abused, as the colony seriously experienced in the case of Argall. The only use of government is to insure the safety of the state from external foes, to secure justice and the free disposition of person and property to each individual, and sometimes to aid in the prosecution of such objects of general utility as individual enterprize cannot accomplish. The moment the colonists began to take an interest in the country, by the enjoyment of their own labor, and the possession of property, it was right that they should have some share in that government, in the prudent conduct of which they were most interested.— Yeardley was aware of this, for without any authority from home which we can trace* * It is not however probable that such an important step was taken without authority. The assembly seems to have been convened in conformity to principles laid down in the instructions to Sir Francis Wyatt in 1621, and probably was procured at the solieitation of the colony after the deposing of Argall. The authority on which the statement that such an assembly was held is Stith 160. (See Hen Stat. at Large, I. 121.) The acts passed were presented on the 29th of March following, to the court of the company for confirmation, and were pronounced by Sir Edwin Sandys then treasurer, to be well and judiciously formed. See also Smith, vol. II. 39, for an account of this assembly in confirmation of Stith. he called together a General Assembly consisting of two members from every town, borough or hundred, besides the governor and council, which met at Jamestown, near the end of June 1619. In this assembly seven corporations were represented, and four more were laid off in the course of the same summer. In this first North American Legislature, wherein was "debated all matters thought expedient for the good of the colony," several acts were passed which were pronounced by the treasurer of the company to be "well and judiciously carried," but which are unfortunately lost to posterity. This was an eventful year to the colony, for in addition to their assembly, a college was established in Henrico, with a liberal endowment. King James had exacted £15,000 from the several bishops of his kingdom for the purpose of educating Indian children, and 10,000 acres of land were now added by the company, and the original design was extended to make it a seminary of learning also for the English. One hundred idle and dissolute persons, in custody for various misdemeanors, were transported by the authority of the king and against the wishes of the company to Virginia. They were distributed through the colony as servants to the planters; and the degradation of the colonial character produced by such a process, was endured for the assistance derived from them in executing the various plans of industry, that were daily extending themselves. This beginning excited in the colonists a desire for using more extensively other labor than their own, an opportunity for the gratification, of which unfortunately too soon occurred. In this eventful year too, a new article was introduced into the trade of the company with the colony, by the good policy of the treasurer Sir Edwin Sandys, which produced a material change in the views and feelings of the colonists with regard to the country. At the accession of Sir Edwin to office, after twelve years labor, and an expenditure of eighty thousand pounds by the company, there was in the colony no more than six hundred persons, men, women and children. In one year he provided a passage for twelve hundred and sixty one new emigrants. Among these were ninety agreeable young women, poor but respectable and incorrupt, to furnish wives to the colonists. The wisdom of this policy is evident,— the men had hitherto regarded. Virginia only as a place of temporary sojourn for the acquisition of wealth, and never dreamed of making a permanent residence in a place where it was impossible to enjoy any of the comforts of domestic life. They had consequently none of those endearing ties of home and kindred to bind them to the country, or attach them to its interests which are so necessary to make a good citizen. This new commodity was transported at the expense of the colony, and sold to the young planters, and the following year another consignment was made of sixty young maids of virtuous education, young, handsome, and well recommended. A wife in the first lot sold generally for one hundred pounds of tobacco, but as the value of the new article became known in the market, the price rose, and a wife would bring a hundred and fifty pounds of tobacco. A debt for a wife was of higher dignity than other debts, and to be paid first. As an additional inducement to marriage, married men were generally preferred in the selection of officers for the colony. Domestic ties were formed, habits of thrift ensued, comforts were increased, and happiness diffused; the tide of emigration swelled, within three years fifty patents for land were granted, and three thousand five hundred persons found their way to Virginia. In the month of August of this year an event occurred which stamped its impress upon the constitution of Virginia, and indeed of the 1620. whole southern portion of America so deeply, that it will be difficult to erase it save by the destruction of society. This was the introduction of 20 African slaves by a Dntch vessel, which availed itself of the freedom of commerce which had been released from the shackles of the company's monopoly in the early part of this year, to rivet forever the bonds of slavery upon a portion of their fellow-creatures and their descendants. The indented and covenanted servants which had been long known in Virginia, and whose condition was little better than that of slavery, was a small evil and easily removed, because they were of the same color and country with their masters; when they were emancipated they leaped at once from their shackels to the full dignity of freedom. No one scorned to associate with them, and no one spurned their alliance, if honorable and worthy in other respects they were equal to their masters and might even rise to distinction But not so to the poor African. Nature has fixed upon him a stamp which cannot be erased or forgotten, the badge of his bondage is borne with him, when his fetters have crumbled to the dust, the curse of Cain is upon him, and no one will mingle with him. By the white man he is loved and cherished as a distant and humble dependant—but he is despised with disgust as a companion;—and the contamination of a mixture with his blood is loathed as a deep, endless, irremediable stain. Under such circumstances emancipation is impossible without removal, but when and where and how is this to be effected? This question posterity must answer,—all that we can do is to treat them with kindness and humanity, and this is done. The overbearing disposition of king James created a powerful popular party in England, which being unable to establish a liberal government at home, was determined to secure for free principles a safe asylum in the colonies. The accomplishment of this determination was accelerated by the disposition of the king to intermeddle with this very subject. He was exceedingly jealous of the company, in which the patriot party prevailed, and suspicious of the liberal principles discussed in its meetings with uncontroled freedom: he feared it as the school of debate, and nursery of Parliamentary leaders. Upon the resignation of Sir Edwin Sandys of his office as treasurer, the king determined to try the extent of his influ- May 17, 1620. ence in the election of a successor to this first office in the company. He accordingly sent in a nomination of four individuals, to one of whom he desired the office to be given; but he proved unsuccessful in his attempt at dictation, and none of his nominees were elected, but the choice fell upon the earl of Southampton. The company having thus vindicated its own privileges, proceeded next to guarantee freedom to the colonists, by a constitution remarkably liberal for the time and circumstances. This charter of freedom, the principles of which the Virginians never could be brought subsequently to relinquish, has been preserved to posterity in "summary of the ordinance and constitution of the treasurer, council and company in England, for a council of state, and another council to be called the General Assembly in Virginia, contained in a commission to Sir Francis Wyatt (the first governor under that ordinance and constitution) and his council," dated July 24, 1621.* * See Henning's Stat. at Large, vol. I. p. 113. The council of state was to be chosen by the treasurer, council and company in England, with the power of removal at pleasure, their duty was to advise, and assist the governor, and to constitute a portion of the General Assembly. This General Assembly was to be called by the governor once a year, and not oftener, unless on very extraordinary and important occasions, it was to consist, in addition to the council of state, of two burgesses, out of every town, hundred or other particular plantation, to be respectively chosen by the inhabitants, in which council all matters were to be decided, determined and ordered by the greater part of the voices then present, reserving to the governor always a negative voice. "And this General Assembly was to have full power, to treat, consult and conclude, as well of all emergent occasions concerning the public weal of the said colony, and every part thereof, as also to make, ordain and enact such general laws and orders, for the behoof of said colony, and the good government thereof, as from time to time might seem necessary." The General Assembly and council of state were required to imitate and follow the policy of the form of government, laws, customs and manner of trial, and of the administration of justice, used in the realm of England, as near as might be, as the company itself was required to do, by its charter. No law or ordinance was to continue in force or validity unless it was solemnly ratified in a general quarterly court of the company, and returned under seal; and it was promised that as soon as the government of the colony should once have been well framed and settled, that no orders of court should afterwards bind the colony, unless they were ratified in the same manner by the General Assembly. Thus were the elements of a free government established, at the arrival of Sir Francis Wyatt, on a soil from which they were never to be eradicated, in less than one year from the time when domestic slavery was instituted in the same place, on a footing which promises equal permanence. When Sir Francis arrived he found that negligence and security amongst the colonists, which is the inevitable consequence of a long peace. Old Powhatan had died in 1618, honored by the esteem and respect of all who knew him,—his own people, holding in grateful remembrance his prowess and policy in youth, and his mildness in age,—and his English friends and brethren admiring his firm support of his dignity, his paternal affection, his mild simplicity, and his native intelligence. He was succeeded in his power by Opechancanough his younger brother, who was cunning, treacherous, revengeful and cruel. He renewed the former treaties, with every assurance of good faith, and wore the mask of peace and friendship so successfully as completely to lull the whites to security. But this crafty prince had always viewed with peculiar jealousy and hate the progress of the colony. He had given much trouble, and engaged in frequent hostilities, whilst he was king of Pamunkee, and it was not to be supposed that he would patiently submit to the continued and rapid encroachments of the whites upon his lands, to the entire extermination or banishment of his people, now that he possessed the empire of his brother. But to meet them in the field was impossible, the disparity in arms was too great, and the numbers in fighting men now equal,* * Bancroft 193 and references there quoted. the attempt would be madness and desperation, and lead to that extermination of his race which he wished to avoid. His only resource was to strike some great and sudden blow which should annibilate the power of the colony at once. He had applied to a king who resided on the Eastern Shore, to purchase a subtle poison† † Smith II 71. which grew only in his dominions, but this king being on good terms with the whites and wishing to enjoy then tiade refused to gratify him. His next resource was in a general massacre, to take effect upon all of the scattered plantations on the same day. The situation of the whites favored this design, they not only placed confidence in the words of the savages which had now been so long faithfully kept, but in then weakness and cowardice. They had extended their plantations over a space of one hundred and forty miles, on both sides of Jaines river, and made some settlements in the neighborhood of the Potomac, in short wherever a rich spot invited to the cultivation of tobacco, there were they established, and an absence of neighbors was preferred.‡ ‡ Smith, vol. II. 66. The planters were careless with their arms, never using their swords, and their fire-arms only for game. The old law making it criminal to teach a savage the use of arms was forgotten, and they were fowlers and hunters, for many of the planters, by which means they became well acquainted with the use of arms and the places in which they were kept. One great object with the settlers, and with the company, in whose instructions we find it perpetually enjoined, had been the conversion of the Indians to the christian religion. To promote this pious object, they had always been received in the most friendly manner, they became market people to the planters, and they were fed at their tables, and lodged in their bed-chambers as friends and brothers. Opechancanough had renewed the treaty with governor Wyatt, and took every other means in his power to avoid suspicion. He told a messenger about the middle of March, that the sky should fall ere he would violate the treaty of peace; only two days before the fatal 22nd, the English were guided in safety and kindness through the forest by the unsuspected Indians, and a Mr. Browne who had been sent to live among them to learn their language was sent safely to his friends,—nay, so well was the dread secret kept that the English boats were borrowed to transport the Indians over the river to consult on the "devilish murder that ensued," and even on the day itself, as well as on the evening before, they came as usual unarmed into the settlements with deer, turkies, fish, fruits and other provisions to sell, and in some places sat down to breakfast with the English. The concert and secrecy of this great plot is the more astonishing when we reflect that the savages were not living together as one nation, and did not have for most purposes, unity of action, but were dispersed in little hamlets containing from thirty to two hundred in a company; "yet they all had warning given them one from another in all their habitations, though far asunder, to meet at the day and hour appointed for the destruction March 22, 1622. of the English at their several plantations; some directed to one place, some to another, all to be done at the time appointed, which they did accordingly some entering their houses under color of trading, so 72 took their advantage, others drawing them abroad under fair pretences, and the rest suddenly falling upon those that were at their labors." They spared no age, sex, or condition, and were so sudden in their indiscriminate slaughter that few could discern the blow or weapon, which brought them to destruction. Their familiarity with the whites led them with fatal precision to the points at which they were certain to be found, and that "fatal morning fell under the bloody and barbarous hands of that perfidious and inhuman people, three hundred and forty seven men, women and children, principally by their own weapons." Not content with this destruction, they brutally defaced and mangled the dead bodies, as if they would perpetrate a new murder, and bore off the severed portions in fiendish triumph. Those who had treated them with especial kindness, and conferred many benefits upon them, who confided so much in them that to the last moment they could not believe mischief was intended, fared no better than the rest. The ties of love and gratitude, the sacred rights of hospitality and reciprocal friendship, oaths, pledges and promises, and even the recent and solemn profession of fidelity to an all-merciful and omnipotent God, were broken asunder or forgotten in obedience to the command of their chief for the execution of a great but diabolical stroke of state policy. With one and only one of all who had been cherished by the whites did gratitude for their kindness and fidelity to his new religion prevail over his allegiance to his king, and affection for his people. A converted Indian who resided with a Mr. Pace, and who was treated by him as a son, revealed the plot to him in the night of the 21st. Pace immediately secured his house and rowed himself up to Jamestown where he disclosed it to the governor, by which means that place and all the neigboring plantations, to which intelligence could be conveyed, was saved from destruction, for the cowardly Indians when they saw the whites upon their guard immediately retreated. Some other places were also preserved, by the undaunted courage of the occupants, who never failed to beat off their assailants, if they were not slain, before their suspicions were excited. By these means was Virginia preserved from total annihilation in a single hour, by this well conceived, well concealed, and well executed plot of her weak and simple adversaries. The larger portion of the colony was saved; for a year after the massacre it contained two thousand five hundred persons; but the consternation produced by it, caused the adoption of a ruinous policy. Instead of marching at once boldly to meet the adversary and driving him from the country or reducing him to subjection by a bloody retaliation, the colonists were huddled together from their eighty plantations into eight, the college, manufactories and other works of public utility, were abandoned, and cultivation confined to a space almost too limited, merely for subsistence. These crowded quarters produced sicknes; and some were so disheartened that they sailed for England. In England this disastrous intelligence so far from dispiriting the company, excited their sympathies to such a degree, that it aroused them to renewed exertion, and a more obstinate determination to secure at all hazards a country which had cost so much blood and treasure. Supplies were promptly despatched, and even the king was moved to the generosity of giving some old rusty arms from the tower, which he never meant to use, and promising further assistance, which he never meant to render. Serious discussions now took place in the courts of the company as to the policy proper to be pursued with the Indians, and some advocated their entire subjection, in imitation of the example of the Spaniards, which policy would surely have been more merciful than that war of extermination which was carried into effect, whether by deliberate design or a system of temporary expedients does not appear. Smith offered the company to protect all their planters from the James to the Potomac, with a permanent force of one hundred soldiers and thirty sailors, with one small bark, and means to build several shallops; and there is no doubt but that he would have accomplished it, by which means the planters could have employed themselves much more successfully in attending to their crops, than when they had to keep perpetual watch, and occasionally to take up arms to defend themselves, or make an attack upon the enemy. Smith received for answer that the company was impoverished, but that he had leave to carry his proposal into effect, if he could find means in the colony, and would give the company half the booty he should acquire; upon which answer he observes, that except some little corn, he would not give twenty pounds for all the booty to be made from the savages for twenty years. The colonists, although they could not be soon again lulled to their former security, speedily recovered from their recent panic, and on July of the same year* * Mr. Bancroft makes this the following year, but if he will look to the date of the law to which he refers, he will find his error. (1 Hen. Stat. L., p. 123,—Act No. 32.) sallied forth with three hundred men to seize the corn and inflict other punishment on the Indians; but they suffered themselves to be deceived by false pretences until the coin was removed from their reach so that they got but little; they succeeded however in burning many of their villages, and destroying much of their property, by which they said they were likely to suffer much during the ensuing winter. We find that a law was passed on the following session by the General Assembly, requiring that on the beginning of July next, the inhabitants of every corporation should fall upon the adjoining savages as had been done the last year; and enacting that those who were hurt should be cured at the public charge, and such as were maimed should be maintained by the country, according to their quality.† † Henning, vol. I. p. 128. We find it also further enacted in 1630, "that the war begun upon the Indians be effectually followed, and that no peace be concluded with them; and that all expeditions undertaken against them should be prosecuted with diligence.‡ ‡ Henning, vol. I. 153. This state of fierce warfare continued to rage with uninterrupted fury until a peace was concluded in 1632, under the administration of governor Harvey.§ § Burke, vol. II. p. 37. In the course of this warfare the Indians were not treated with the same tenderness, with which they had generally been before? ? See an instance to the contrary in the case of the Appomattucks—ante pa. 561. the massacre, but their habitations, cleared lands, and pleasant sites, when once taken possession of, were generally retained by the victors, and the vanquished forced to take refuge in the woods and marshes. Whilst these events were transpiring in the colony, an important change in the character of their government was about to take place in England. 1623. The company had been unsuccessful; the fact could no longer be denied. They had transported more than nine thousand persons, at an expense exceeding a hundred thousand pounds, and yet in nearly eighteen years there were only about two thousand persons in the colony, and its annual exports did not exceed twenty thousand pounds in value. The king took advantage of the present unfortunate state of affairs, to push his plans for the dissolution of the company. He carefully fomented the dissentions which arose, and encouraged the weaker party; which readily sought the aid of his powerful arm. He had long disliked the democratic freedom of their discussions, and had of late become envious of their little profits on the trade of the colonists, which he felt every disposition to divert into his own coffers, and determined to make good use of the present state of despondency in most of the company, and unpopularity with the public, to effect his designs. Wishing however to gain his end by stealth, and secret influence with their officers, rather than by open violence, he again tried his 1623. strength in the nomination of four individuals from whom the company were to choose their treasurer. But he was again signally defeated, and the earl of Southampton re-elected by a large majority, the king's candidates receiving only eight votes in seventy. Failing in this, it was manifest that the company was not to be browbeaten into submission to his dictation, and he only considered how the charter of the company might be revoked, with the least violation to the laws of England. To effect this with plausible decency some allegation of improper conduct was to be made, and some proof ferreted out. The first of these objects was effected by two long petitions by members of the Royal faction in the company, setting forth at full length every evil which had accrued to the colony, from its earliest establishment to that hour, and charging all upon the mismanagement of the company. For many of these charges there was too much truth, and the faults of the company could be easily seen after the accidents had happened, but whether they were not necessarily incidental to the situation of things in Virginia, or they might have been avoided by the king or a corporation differently constituted, are questions difficult to answer, but these petitions contained, mingled with these truths, a great proportion of glaring falsehood as to the physical and moral condition of the colony. They had been prepared and presented with great secrecy, but the company contrived to obtain copies of them, and refuted their slanders by the most irrefragible testimony, many facts being in the cognziance of the members themselves, and others established by the evidence of respectable persons who had long resided in Virginia. This mass of evidence was laid before the king, in the vain hope, that he might be induced to disregard the petitions; but part of his object was now gained, the charges were made, the next step was to procure a semblance of proof, for this purpose in a few days, in answer to the prayer in one of the petitions, he issued a commission under the great seal, to seven persons to enquire into all matters respecting Virginia, from the beginning of its settlement. The better to enable these commissioners to conduct their investigations, by an order of the privy council, all the records of the company of whatsoever nature were seized, the deputy treasurer was imprisoned, and on the arrival of a ship from Virginia, all the papers on board were inspected. The report of these commissioners has never transpired, but it was without doubt, such as the king wished and expected; for by an October, 1623, order in council he made known, that having taken into his princely consideration, the distressed state of Virginia, occasioned by the ill-government of the company, he had resolved by a new charter, to appoint a governor and twelve assistants to reside in England; and a governor and twelve assistants to reside in Virginia; the former to be nominated by his majesty in council, the latter to be nominated by the governor and assistants in England, and be appointed by the king in council, and that all proceedings should be subject to the royal direction. This was a return at one step to the charter of 1606. The company was called together to consider upon this arbitrary edict, under an alternative similar to the one given to witches upon their trial; if they could swim with a heavy weight about their necks, they were burned as guilty, if they sunk and drowned they were acquitted; the king gave the company the privilege of accepting his proposition and resigning its charter, or of refusing and having the charter annulled. The company which had refused to gratify the king in the choice of its officers, was less disposed to comply with this suicidal requisition. The astounding order was read over three several times before they could convince themselves that their ears informed them correctly of its purport. At length the vote was taken and one hundred and twelve votes were against the relinquishment, and twenty-six, the precise number of the king's faction, in favor of it. The company asked further time for a more deliberate decision, as there had not been sufficient notice, few members were present, and it was one of those matters of importance which could not be decided, by the terms of their charter, except at a regular quarterly meeting, but the council would not listen to the proposition, ordering the company to meet again in three days, and give a clear, direct and final answer. In obedience to this order an extraordinary court was summoned, and the question of surrender submitted to their consideration, upon which only nine of the seventy present voted in its favor, an answer was returned that they would defend their charter. The knowledge of these proceedings transpiring produced a shock to the credit of the company, which palsied for the time the spirit of commercial enterprise; to remedy this evil the privy council declared that the private property of every one should be protected, and secured by additional guarantees if necessary; that they should proceed with their regular business; and all ships bound for Virginia should sail. To endeavor to discover something more authentic against the company than his secret conclave of commissioners had yet been able to obtain, the king now thought proper to send John Harvey, John Oct. 24, 1623, Pory, Abraham Piersey, Samuel Matthews, and John Jefferson, as commissioners to Virginia. "To make more particular and diligent enquiry touching divers matters, which concerned the state of Virginia, and in order to facilitate this enquiry, the governor and council of Virginia were ordered to assist the commissioners in this scrutiny, by all their knowledge and influence."* * Burk I. 272. The commissioners early in the ensuing year arrived in the colony. In all of this controversy between the king and the company, the colony 1624. not supposing its chartered rights were likely to be violated by either party, and feeling little interest in the discussion of rights which belonged entirely to others, which they never supposed that they were to possess; had acted with entire neutrality, and cared little whether they were to be under the general superintendence of the courts of the company, or a council chosen by the king, so long as they could regulate their own affairs by their own General Assembly.† † The king and company quarrelled, and by a mixture of law and force, the latter were ousted of all their rights, without retribution, after having expended £100,000 in establishing the colony, without the smallest aid from the government. King James suspended their powers by proclamation of July 15, 1624, and Charles I. took the government into his own hands. Both sides had their partisans in the colony; but in truth the people of the colony in general thought themselves little concerned in the dispute. There being three parties interested in these several charters; what passed between the first and second it was thought could not affect the third. If the king seized on the powers of the company, they only passed into other hands, without increase or diminution, while the rights of the people remained as they were. Jefferson's Notes on Va., pa. 152-3. In such a mood would the commissioners have found the colony and General Assembly, had they not procured copies of the two slanderous petitions, in spite of all the precautions of the king and the secrecy of his council and commissioners. Although they felt little interest in the controversy, they felt great interest in defending themselves from defamation, and their country from false and malicious representations, well calculated to disparage and depreciate it in the estimation of those, with whom they wished it to stand fairest. In six days from their meeting Feb. 20, 1624, they had prepared spirited and able answers to these petitions; declaring in their preamble, "that they holding it a sin against God and their own sufferings, to permit the world to be abused with false reports, and to give to vice the reward of virtue,—They, in the name of the whole colony of Virginia, in their General Assembly met, many of them having been eye-witnesses and sufferers in those times, had framed out of their duty to their country, and love of truth the following answer given to the praises of Sir T. Smith's government, in the said declaration." They next drafted a petition to the king, which with a letter to the privy council and the other papers, were committed to the care of Mr. John Pountis, a member of the council, who was selected to go to England to represent the general interests of the colony before his majesty and the privy council; and whose expenses were provided for by a tax of four pounds of the best merchantable tobacco for every male person sixteen years of age, who had been in the country for one year. This gentleman unfortunately died on his passage. The letter to the privy council marks very strongly the value which they set even at that early day upon the right of legislating for themselves, the principal prayer in it, being "that the governors may not have absolute power, and that they might still retain the liberty of popular assemblies, than which, nothing could more conduce to the public satisfaction, and public utility." A contest of wits was commenced between the commissioners and the Assembly. The former under various pretexts withheld from the latter a a sight of their commission, and the other papers with which they had been charged, and the governor and the Assembly thought proper to preserve an equal mystery as to their own proceedings. In this dilemma Mr. Pory, who was one of the commissioners, and who had been secretary to the company, and discharged from his post for betraying its councils to the earl of Warwick; now suborned Edward Sharpless, a clerk of the council, to give him copies of the proceedings of that body and of the Assembly. This treachery was discovered, and the clerk was punished with the loss of his ears; whilst an account was sent home to the company; expressive of the greatest abhorrence at the baseness and treachery of Pory. The commissioners finding their secret manœuvering defeated, next endeavored, by the most artful wheedling, to induce the Assembly to petition the crown for a revocation of the charter. In reply to this the Assembly asked for their authority to make such a proposition, which of course they could not give without betraying their secret instructions, and were compelled to answer the requisition in general terms and professions. The Assembly took no farther notice of the commissioners, but proceeded with their ordinary legislation. Thirty-five acts of this Assembly have been preserved to the present time, and exhibit with great strength, the propriety and good sense with which men can pass laws for the regulation of their own interests and concerns. One of these acts establishes at once in the most simple and intelligible language the great right of exemption from taxation without representation; it runs in these words:—"The governor shall not lay any taxes or impositions upon the colony, their lands or commodities, other way than by the authority of the General Assembly, to be levied and employed as the said Assembly shall appoint."—By a subsequent act at was declared that the governor should not withdraw the inhabitants from their private labors to any service of his own, upon any color whatsoever, and in case the public service required the employment of many hands, before the holding of a General Assembly, he was to order it, and the levy of men was to be made by the governor and whole body of the council in such manner as would be least burthensome to the people and most free from partiality. To encourage good conduct, the old planters who had been in the colony since the last arrival of Gates, were exempted from taxation or military duty. Many acts of general utility were passed, the members of the Assembly were privileged from arrest, lands were to be surveyed and their boundaries recorded, which is no doubt the origin of our highly beneficial recording statutes, vessels arriving were prohibited from breaking their cargoes until they had reported themselves, inspectors of tobacco were established in every settlement, the use of sealed weights and measures was enforced, provision was made for paying the public debt, "brought on by the late troubles," no person was, upon the rumor of supposed change and alteration, to presume to be disobedient to the present government, or servants to their private officers, masters or overseers, at their uttermost perils. Wise regulations were likewise made to prevent surprises by the Indians, every house was to be fortified with palisadoes; no man should go or send abroad without a party sufficiently armed, or to work without their arms, with a centinel over them, the inhabitants were forbidden to go aboard ships or elsewhere in such numbers as to endanger the safety of their plantations, every planter was to take care to have sufficient arms and ammunition in good order; watch was to be kept by night, and no planter was to suffer powder to be expended in amusement or entertainments. To promote corn-planting, and ensure plenty of provision, no limit was fixed to its price viewers were appointed to see that every man planted a sufficiency for his family, and all trade with the savages for corn was strictly prohibited. Having thus given a specimen of colonial spirit, and colonial legislation, we return to the little intrigues of James, who was striving by every means in his power to become possessed of the control of the colony, partly to gratify his love of arbitrary authority and of money, and partly to gratify his royal self-complacency by framing a code of laws, for a people with whose character and condition he was utterly unacquainted, and who from the specimens recently given appeared to be fully competent to the management of their own affairs, without the dictation or advice of this royal guardian, who while he displayed the craft without the talent of a Philip, aspired to the character of a Solon. The recent acts of the king led to a solemn council of the company on the state of their affairs, in which they confirmed by an overwhelming majority the previous determination to defend their charter, and asked for a restitution of their papers for the purpose of preparing their defence. This request was pronounced reasonable by the attorney general, and complied with. Whilst these papers were in the hands of the company, they were transcribed, and the copy has been fortunately preserved, and presents a faithful record of many portions of Virginia history which it would be otherwise impossible to elucidate.* * Burk, pa. 274-5. Stith compiled his history principally from these documents. The king had caused a quo warranto to be issued against the company soon after the appointment of his commissioners to go to Nov. 10, 1624, Virginia, and the cause was tried in the King's Bench, in Trinity Term of 1624. A cause which their Royal master had so much at heart could not long be doubtful with judges entirely dependent upon his will for their places, it is even credibly reported that this important case, whereby the rights of a powerful corporation were divested, and the possibility of remuneration for all of their trouble and expense forever cut off, was decided upon a mere technical question of special pleading.* * Burk, pa. 274-5. Stith compiled his history principally from these documents. In the mean time the commissioners had returned, and reported very favorably of the soil and climate of Virginia, but censuring deeply the conduct of the company,—recommending the government of the original charter of 1606, and declaring that a body so large and so democratic in its forms as the company, could never persevere in a consistent course of policy, but must veer about as the different factions should prevail. In this it must be admitted that there was much truth, and all hopes of profit having for some time expired, and the company only being kept up by the distinguished men of its members, from patriotic motives and as an instrument of power for thwaiting the king, in which capacity its present unpopularity rendered it of little use,—it was now suffered to expire under the judicial edict, without a groan. The expiration of the charter brought little immediate charge to the actual government of the colony,—a large committee was formed by the king, consisting principally of his privy council, to discharge the functions of the extinct company, Sir Francis Wyatt was reappointed governor, and he and his council only empowered to govern "as fully and amply as any governor and council resident there, at any time within the space of five years last past,"—which was the exact period of their representative government. The king in appointing the council in Virginia, refused to appoint embittered paitisans of the court faction, but formed the government of men of moderation. So leaving Virginia free, whilst his Royal Highness is graciously pleased to gratify his own vanity in preparing a new code of laws to regulate her affairs, we pass on to a new chapter. † Note to Bancroft, pa. 207. Stith, pa. 329, 330, doubts if judgment was passed. The doubt may be removed. "Before the end of the same term, a judgment was declared by the Lord Chief Juitice Ley, against the company and their charter, only upon failer on mistake in pleading."

Accession of Charles I;—Tobacco trade,—Yeardley governor,—his commission favorable—his death and character,—Lord Baltimore's reception,—State of religion,—legisletion upon the subject,—Invitation to the Puritans to settle on Delaware bay,—Harvey governor,—Error with regard to his early administration,—Dismemberment of the colony,—Grant of Carolina and Marylaud,—probable cause of discontent, —Harvey deposed—restored,—Wyatt governor,—Acts of the Legislature improperly censured,—Berkeley governor,—Indian relations,— Opechancanough prisoner—his death,—Change of government in England,—Fleet and army sent to reduce Virginia,—Preparation far defence by Berkeley,—Agreement entered into between the colony and the commissioners of the commonwealth,—Indian hostilities,—Matthews elected governor,—Difficulties between the governor and the legislature —adjusted,—State of the colony and its trade,—Commissioners sent to England,—The Restoration,—General legislation. The dissolution of the London Company was soon followed by the death of James, and the accession of his son Charles I. The March 27, 1625 king troubled himself little about the political rights and privileges of the colony, and suffered them to grow to the strength of established usage by his wholesome neglect; whilst he was employed in obtaining a monopoly of their tobacco. This valuable article, the use of which extended with such unaccountable rapidity, had early attracted the avidity of king James. The 19th article of the charter of 1609 had exempted the company, their agents, factors and assignees from the payment of all subsidies and customs in Virginia for the space of one and twenty years, and from all taxes and impositions forever, upon any goods imported thither, or exported thence into any of the realms or dominions of England; except the five per cent usual by the ancient trade of merchants.* * Henning St. at L. v. I. p. 94. But notwithstanding the express words of this charter, a tax was laid by the farmers of the customs in the year 1620 upon the tobacco of the colony; which was not only high of itself, but the more oppressive because it laid the same tax upon Virginia and Spanish tobacco, when the latter sold in the market for three times the price of the former. In the same year, the same prince was guilty of another violation of the charter in forcing the company to bring all of their tobacco into England, when he found that a portion of their trade had been diverted into Holland, and establishments made at Middleburg and Flushing. The charters all guaranteed to the colony all of the rights, privileges, franchises, and immunities of native born Englishmen, and this act of usurpation was the first attempt on the part of the mother country to monopolize the trade of the colony. The next year the king, either his avidity being unsatisfied, or not liking the usurped and precarious tenure by which his gains were held, inviegled the Virginia and Somer's Isle's company into an arrangement, by which they were to become the sole importers of tobacco; being bound however to import not less than forty nor more than sixty thousand pounds of Spanish varinas, and paying to the king in addition to the six pence duty before paid, one-third part of all the tobacco landed in the realms. The king on his part was to prohibit all other importation and all planting in England and Ireland; and that which was already planted was to be confiscated. When the company petitioned Parliament to prolong its existence in opposition to the efforts of the king, they failed,—but that portion of their petition which asked for the exclusive monopoly of tobacco to Virginia and the Somer Isles, was granted, and a royal proclamation Sep. 29, 1624. issued accordingly; whether this exclusiveness was understood with the limitation in the previous contract between the king and the two companies, it is impossible to say, as the original documents are not accessible to the writer.* * Burk, 1, 291, and Bancroft 1, 206, quoting Stith Cobbert' Parliament Hist and Hazard. But the probabilities are greatly against the limitation. Charles had not been long on the throne before he issued a proclamation confirming the exclusive privileges of the Virginia and April 9, 1625. Somer Isles tobacco; and prohibiting a violation of their monopoly, under penalty of censure by the dread star chamber. This was soon followed by another in which he carefully set forth the forfeiture of their charter by the company, and the immediate dependance of the colony upon the crown; concluding by a plain intimation of his intention to become their sole factor. Soon after this a rumor reached the colonies that an individual was in treaty with the king for an exclusive contract for tobacco, one of the conditions of which would have led to the importation of so large an amount of Spanish tobacco as would have driven that of the colonists from the market; the earnest representations of the colony on this subject caused an abandonment of the scheme, but in return the colony was obliged to excuse itself from a charge of trade with the lower countries, and promise to trade only with England.† † Burk's Ancient records Burk, V. 2, 19. But the king's eagerness for the possession of this monopoly was not to be baffled thus; he made a formal proposition to the colony for their exclusive trade, in much the same language as one tradesman would use to another, and desired that the General Assembly might be convened for the purpose of considering his proposition. The answer by the General Assembly to this proposition is preserved March 26, 1628. It sets forth in strong but respectful language the injury which had been done the planters by the mere report of an intention to subject their trade to a monopoly; they state the reasons for not engaging in the production of the other staples mentioned by the king; and dissent from his proposition as to the purchase of their tobacco, demanding a higher price and better terms of admission, in exchange for the exclusive monopoly which he wished.‡ ‡ Hening, vol. 1. 134. In the mean time the death of his father rendered it necesary for Sir Francis Wyatt to return to Europe to attend to his private affairs, 1626. and the king appointed Sir George Yeardley his successor. This was itself a sufficient guarantee of the political privileges of the colony, as he had had the honor of calling the first colonial assembly but in addition to this his powers were like those of his predecessor, limited to the executive authority exercised by the governor within five years last past. These circumstances taken in connection with the express sanction given by Charles to the power of a Legislative Assembly with regard to his proffered contract for tobacco sufficiently prove that he had no design of interfering with the highly-prized privilege of self-government enjoyed by the colonists and fully justifies the General Assembly in putting the most favorable construction upon the king's ambiguous words announcing his determination to preserve inviolate all the "former interests" of Virginia, which occur in his letter of 1627.* * Burk, v. 2. pa. 18. Thus were those free principles established in Virginia, for which the mother country had to struggle for sometime longer; the colony rose in the estimation of the public, and a thousand new emigrants arrived in one year; which of course much enhanced the price of provision. Death now closed the career of Yeardley. The character of his administration is exhibited in the history of the colony; and Nov. 14, 1627. the estimate placed upon his character by those who were best acquainted with his conduct, and who were little disposed to flatter undeservedly either the living or the dead, is to be found in a eulogy written by the government of Virginia to the privy council, announcing his death. In obedience to the king's commission to the council, they elected Francis West governor, the day after the burial of Yeardley. He held the commission until the 5th of March 1628, when designing to sail for England, John Pott was chosen to succeed him.† † Burk, v. 2. p. 23. Hening, v. 1. p. 4 and 13. Burk v. II. p. 23. is at a loss to account for the fate of West. Pott did not continue long in office, for the king, when the death of Yeardley was known, issued his commission to Sir John Harvey, who arrived some time between October 1628 and March 1629. In the interval between the death of Yeardley and the arrival of Harvey, occurred the first act of religious intolerance, which defile the annals of Virginia. Lord Baltimore, a catholic nobleman, allured by the rising reputation of the colony, abandoned his settlement in Newfoundland and came to Virginia, where instead of being received with the cheerful welcome of a friend and a brother, he was greeted with the oath of allegiance and supremacy, the latter of which it was well known his conscience would not allow him to take. Much allowance is to be made for this trespass upon religious freedom, before we attribute it to a wilful violation of natural liberty. The times and circumstances ought to be considered. The colony had grown into life while the violent struggles between the Romish and Protestant churches were yet rie The ancient tyranny and oppression of the Holy See were yet fresh in the memory of all, its cruelties and harsh intolerance in England were recent, and yet continuing in the countries in which its votaries had the control of the civil government. The light of Protestantism itself was the first dawn of religious freedom, and the thraldom in which mankind had been eld by Catholic fetters for so many ages was too terrible, to risque the possibility of their acquiring any authority in government. Eye-witnesses of the severities of Mary were yet alive in England, and doubtless many of the colonists had heard fearful relations of the religious sufferings during her reign, probably some had suffered in their own families; most of them had emigrated whilst the excitement against the Papists was still raging in England with its greatest fury, and continually kept in action by the discovery or pretended discovery of Popish plots to obtain possession of the government. Was it wonderful then that a colony which with a remarkable uniformity of sentiment professed a different religion, should be jealous of a faith which sought by every means in its power to obtain supreme control, and used that control for the extermination, by the harshest means, of all other creeds? The colony in Virginia was planted when the incestuous and monstrous connection of church and state had not been severed in any civilized country on the globe;—at a period when it would have been heresy to attempt such a divorce, because it required all the aid of the civil power to give men sufficient freedom to "profess and by argument to maintain" any other creed than one,—and that one the creed of Rome. The anxiety of the British government upon this subject, so far from being unnatural was highly laudable, since all its efforts were necessary to sustain its new-born power of professing its own creed. The awful effect of Catholic supremacy, displayed in a neighboring kingdom, afforded a warning too terrible* * The massacre of the Protestants by the Catholics on St. Bartholomew's day, in France, in 1572. to be easily forgotten, and it would have been as unwise to allow the Catholics equal civil privileges at that day, as it would be impolitic and unjust now to exclude them. We find this regard for religious freedom, (for emancipation from the Pope's authority was a great step in religious freedom,) carefully fostered in the colonies. Every charter requires the establishment of the church of England, and authorises the infliction of punishment for drawing off the people from their religion, as a matter of equal importance with their allegiance. For at that period before any important differences between the Protestants had arisen, when but two religions were struggling for existence, not to be of the church of England was to be a Papist, and not to acknowledge the secular supremacy of the King, was to bow to the authority of the Pope. The catholics as the only subject of terror, were the only subjects of intolerance; no sufficient number of dissenters had availed themselves of the great example of Protestantism in rejecting any creed which did not precisely satisfy their consciences, to become formidable to mother church; nor had she grown so strong and haughty in her new-fledged power as to level her blows at any but her first great antagonist.† † The persecution of the Puritans was an exception to this. They were persecuted with considerable rigor, but their numbers were small, consisting only of two churches, and most of those who then existed went to Holland with their leaders John Robinson and William Brewster, in 1607 and 8, and settled in Amsterdam, whence they removed to Leyden in 1609, whence they sailed to America in 1620, and landed in Cape Cod Harbor on the 7th of November, and settled Plymouth on the 31st of December following:—Holmes' Am. An. 156—203. The colony in Virginia consisted of church of England men, and many of the first acts of their Legislature relate to provision for the church. Glebe lands were early laid off, and livings provided. The ministers were considered not as pious and charitable individuals, but as officers of the state, bound to promote the true faith and sound morality by authority of the community, by which they were paid and to which they were held responsible for the performance of their duty. The very first act of Assembly, which was passed, required that in every settlement in which the people met to worship God, a house should be appropriated exclusively to that purpose; and a place paled in to be used solely as a burying ground; the second act imposed the penalty of a pound of tobacco for absence from divine service on Sunday without sufficient excuse, and fifty pounds for a month's absence; the third required uniformity, as near as might be, with the canons in England; the fourth enjoined the observance of the holy days, (adding the 22d March, the day of the Massacre to the number) dispensing with some `by reason of our necessities;' the fifth punished any minister absenting himself from his church above two months in the year with forfeiture of half of his estate,—and four months, his whole estate and curacy; the sixth punished disparagement of a minister; the seventh prohibited any man from disposing of his tobacco or corn until the minister's portion was first paid.* * Hening, v. 1. p. 121-4. This sacred duty discharged, the Assembly next enact salutary regulations for the state. We find at the session of 1629 the act requiring attendance at church on the Sabbath specially enforced, and a clause added forbidding profanation of that day by travelling or work; also an act declaring that all those who work in the ground shall pay tithes to the minister. We find requisition of uniformity with the canons of the English church not only repeated in every new commission from England, but re-enacted by the Legislature of 1629-30, and in 1631-2, as well as in the several revisals of the laws. In the acts of 1631-2, we find many acts conveying the idea advanced of ministers being considered public officers; and churchwardens required to take an oath to present offences against decency or morality, which made them in effect censors of the public morals. In these acts it is made the duty of ministers to teach children the Lord's prayer, commandments, and the articles of faith; also to attend all persons dangerously sick, to instruct and comfort them in their distress; to keep registers of christening, marriages and deaths; and to preserve in themselves strict moral conduct, as an advancement to religion and an example to others. We find also frequent acts passed providing for the payment of the ministers, until the session of 1657-8, when church and state seem to have been effectually divorced; for though no act of religious freedom was passed, but all were still expected, rather than compelled, to conform to the church of England, yet the compulsory payment of ministers was abandoned, and all matters relating to the church were left entirely to the control of the people.† † 1st Hening, 433. From the review which we have given of the religious condition of England and the colony, it must be manifest that the tender of the oath of supremacy to Lord Baltimore was not only a religious but a civil duty in the council, which they could by no means have omitted without a violation of their own oaths, laws and charters. But if any further proof were necessary, to show that it flowed from this source and not from a disposition to religious intolerance,—it is afforded by the liberal invitation given in the instructions to Captain Bass to the Puritans who had settled at New Plymouth, to desert their cold and barren soil and come and settle upon Delaware Bay, which was in the limits of Virginia.‡ ‡ Burk, v. II. p. 32, on authority of ancient records. Harvey met his first General Assembly in March, and its acts as those of several succeding sessions, only consist of the usual business acts of 1629. the colony. We have now approached a period in our history upon which the few scattered and glimmering lights which exist, have rather served to mislead than to guide historians. It is a period replete with charges made by historians, of the most heinous character against the governor, with no evidence upon record to support them. The truth is that Sir John Harvey was deposed and sent home by the colony for some improper conduct, but what that was, does not fully appear, and historians seem to have thought it their duty to supply the defect in the record, by abusing his administration as arbitrary and tyrannical from the first; the charge is without evidence, and every probability is against its truth. During the whole of his administration the General Assembly met and transacted their business as usual. The fundamental laws which they had passed to which we have before referred, restraining the powers of the governor, and asserting the powers of the Assembly, were passed again as of course. There could manifestly be no oppression from this source. The General Assembly ordered the building of forts, made the contracts, provided the payments, provided garrisons and soldiers for the field when necessary, and disbanded them when the occasion for their services had ceased.* * 1 Hening 140, 1, 2, 3, 150, 130, 171, 2, 5, 7, 9, 180, 202. The Assembly and the soldiers were planters and they could be little disposed to oppress themselves, their families and friends. The only evidence which exists against Harvey is the fact of his being deposed, and sent home with commissioners to complain of his conduct to the king, but this did not occur until 1635, after the extensive grants had been made to Lord Baltimore and others, which dismembered the colony, and were so displeasing to the planters; and we shall see that aid or connivance in these grants were the probable causes of Harvey's unpopularity. Burke supports his charge of attempted speculation and tyranny, upon the fact that the assembly of 1631, provided against the raising or expending of money, or levying men without the consent of the assembly; but this was a mere re-enactment of the laws of 1623-4, which we have seen, and which were passed under the popular administration of Wyatt, and seem to have been very justly looked upon by the legislature as fundamental laws.† † These frequent repetitions so far from being a special blow at Harvey, was a mere matter of course, "it was customary too to repeal all former laws at each session, and either re-enact them in the very same words of the act repealed, or with such amendments as experience might suggest." Hening, preface, p. VI. The same remark applies to the provision of security for the Burgesses from arrest,—that was provided in the first set of laws of which we have any record. Since Burke has committed such an error, whilst he finds great fault with those who went before him, it will be unnecessary here to notice the wild and unfounded speculations in which his predecessors indulged.‡ ‡ Robertson evidently does not perceive the distinction between taxing the produce of the colony upon its arrival in England, which they could not prevent, and laying taxes on them at home to which their legislature never would lend its sanction, or the people peaceably submit. He also includes in his censure the popular Yeardley, as suppressing those very assemblies which he was the first to establish, and which eulogised him after his death,—He says, "from the tenor of the king's commission, as well as from the known spirit of his policy, it is apparent, that he intended to vest every power of government, both legislative and executive in the governor and council, without recourse to the representatives of the people, as possessing a right to enact laws for the community, or to impose taxes upon it." How can this be said of the commission referring to the executive authority of the "five years last past" during which the Assembly had ruled every thing? "Yeardly and his council, who seem to have been fit instruments for carrying this system of arbitrary rule into execution, did not fail to put such a construction on the words of their commission as was most favorable to their own jurisdiction. During a greater part of Charles's reign, Virginia knew no other law than the will of the sovereign. Statutes were published, and taxes imposed, without once calling the representatives of the people to authorize them by their sanction. At the same time that the people were bereaved of political rights which they deemed essential to freemen and citizens, their private property was violently invaded. A proclamation was issued, by which under pretexts equally absurd and frivolous, they were prohibited from selling tobacco to any person but certain commissioners appointed by the king to buy it on his aceount." Robertson's Virginia, p. 107, 8. Again, p. 109, he says "the murmurs and complaints which such a system of administration excited, were augmented by the vigour with which Sir John Harvey, who succeeded Yeardly in the government of the colony, enforced every act of power. Rapacious, unfeeling and haughty, he added insolence to oppression, and neither regarded the sentiments, nor listened to the remonstrances of the people under his command. The colonists, far from the seat of government and overawed by authority derived from a royal commission, submitted long to his tyranny and exactions. Their patience was at last exhausted, and in a transport of popular rage they seized their governor and sent him a prisoner to England, accompanied by two of their number," &amp;c. To say nothing where there is no authority for saying anything, is not only excusable, but praiseworthy, to give in such cases ingenious conjectures as such may be useful, but to present a tissue of conjectures as facts cannot be excused in any one, and the less in Dr. Robertson, as his high character would stamp them with an authority which few others could give. Judge Marshall unfortunately copies Robertson verbatim, thus showing at once that one great mind has been mislead by his standing as a writer, to take that as truth which is not only unfounded, but contradicted by well established facts. As long as Robertson had Smith and Stith to guide him, he is very good authority, but when he is left by them he is at sea. We will conclude this note by a quotation of an opposite character from a judicious and laborious modern writer. Bancroft, p. 215, after asserting that the colony enjoyed during this season, represented as so oppressive, an "independant colonial legislation," he appends the following note: "as an opposite statement has received the sanction, not of Oldmixon, Chalmers and Robertson only, but of Marshall and of Story. (See Story's Commentaries, v. I. p. 28, "without the slighest effort to convene a colonial assembly,") I deem it necessary to state that many of the statutes of Virginia, under Harvey still exist, and that though many others are lost, the first volume of Hening's Statutes at Large proves, beyond a question, that assemblies were convened at least as often as follows: 1630, March, H. v. I. p. 147, 153. 1630, April, ibid, 257, 1632, February, ibid, 153, 177 1632, Sept., ibid, 178, 202 1633, February, ibid, 202, 209 1633, August, ibid, 209, 222 1634, ibid, 223 1635, ibid, 223 1636, ibid, 229 1637, ibid, 227 1639, ibid, 229, 230 1640, ibid, 268 1641, June, ibid, 259, 262. 1642, January, ibid, 267 1642, April, ibid, 230 1642, June, ibid, 269 Considering how imperfect are the early records, it is surprising that so considerable a list can be established. The instructions to Sir William Berkeley do not first order assemblies, but speak of them as if a thing established. At an adjouined session of Berkeley's first legislature, the assembly declares "its meeting exceeding customary limits in this place used." Hening, v. I. p. 233. This is a plain declaration, that assemblies were the custom and use of Virginia at the time of Berkeley's arrival. If any doubts remain, it would be easy to multiply arguments and references." The first act of tyranny towards the colony which we find recorded against Charles, was his grant in 1630 to Sir Robert Heath of a large portion of the lands of the colony; commencing at the 36th degree of latitude and including the whole southern portion of the United States, under the name of Carolina. But as this country was not settled until long afterwards, and the charter became void by non-compliance with its terms, it could not be regarded as injurious by the colony, except as an evidence of the facility with which their chartered rights could be divested. Another instance of a more objectionable character soon occurred. Cecilius 1632. Calvert, Lord Baltimore, obtained a grant of that portion of Virginia which is now included in the state of Maryland, and immediately commenced a settlement upon it, notwithstanding the value which the Virginians set upon it, and their having actually made settlements within its limits.* * Holme's Am. An. v. I. p. 261, 265. William Claiborne who had been a member of the council and secretary of state for Virginia had obtained a license from the king to "traffic in those parts of America, where there was no license," which had been confirmed by Harvey. In pursuance of this authority he had settled himself at Kent Island near the city of Annapolis, and seemed by no means inclined tamely to relinquish his possessions. He resisted the encroachments of Maryland by force. This was the first controversy between the whites which ever took place on the waters of the Chesapeake. Claiborne was indicted and found guilty of murder, piracy and sedition, and to escape punishment he fled to Virginia. When the Maryland commissioners demanded him, Harvey refused to give him up, but sent him to England to be tried. It is highly probable that the conduct of Harvey in giving up instead of protecting Claiborne, incensed the colony against him, for they clearly thought the Maryland charter an infringement of their rights, and they were little inclined to submit to imposition from any quarter. Burke himself who thinks the colony wished Claiborne to be given up to Maryland, says that in the year 1633 there was a developement of a land speculation on the part of the governor, highly injurious to the colony. "It appears that by a collision with the king's commissioners, large tracts of land were disposed of to absentees, not unfrequently interferring with the rights of actual settlers, and involving subjects of future litigation. By this proceeding, the colony was threatened with dismemberment, and the mischiefs were aggravated by the conditions of those grants, which exempted the proprietors from the payment of quit rents. Property conveyed with such absolute and unqualified formalities, seemed to give the proprietors the rights of sovereign authority, instead of the guarded restraints of a fœdal tenure; and an abundant source of litigation was laid up for posterity by establishing an imperium in imperio† † Lord Fairfax held a Court Baron,—Burke v. VI. p. 38. within the bosom of the colony." Surely this speculation was of itself sufficient cause for dissatisfaction, and renders it unnecessary to look further to account for the conduct of the colony. To have the lands for which they had fought and struggled with so much perseverance, and through so many difficulties suddenly wrested from them by an act of arbitrary authority; and their governor not only conniving, but making a speculation on the alienation of their blood bought territory, was enough to have excited a people to take even more summary vengeance than that afforded by a trial and ejection from the gubernatorial chair. Nor was it any palliation to the evil that few of their actual settlements were within the ceded territory, for they had not struggled so strenuously only for such small portion of ground as they might actually live upon, but upon a grant of a vast territory, with all its broad waters, magnificent forests, lofty mountains and fertile plains,—a mighty empire worthy of the people who had strived so hard to win it. But now the whole south was cut off at one blow; the jurisdiction of the upper portion of their own beautiful bay which they actually occupied, was torn from them, their territory was severed into two portions by the intrusion of a new power into its centre, and the hardy citizens who had won the country and established the blessings of a free government, were to bend the knee in feudal vassalage, or surrender their homes and possessions to their new lords, who never struck a blow in the acquisition of their vast estates. Virginia sent a remonstrance in the name of all her planters, against the grant of Maryland; and the privy council unable to deny the manifest justice of their representations, but unwilling to offend the king by a decision against the validity of lord Baltimore's patent, decided that he might retain it, and the Virginians have their remedy at law. The law at that time in the king's courts, in cases in which he was concerned being the king's will; the Virginians declined entering the tribunal, and making a virtue of necessity, entered into a treaty of commerce and amity with their new neighbor. The account which we have of the trial of Harvey is extremely meagre, detailing neither the accusations or the evidence, but only the fact. The manner of proceeding however, as it appears on the record, is as little like that of an enslaved people as it is like a "transport of popular rage and indignation." The whole matter seems to have been conducted with calm deliberation, as a free people acting upon the conduct of an unworthy servant. The first entry upon the subject runs thus:—"an Assembly to be called to receive complaints against Sir John Harvey, on the petition of many inhabitants, to meet 7th of May." Could as much coolness, deliberation and publicity be given to action against a tyrant who had already trodden liberty under foot, or is a transport of popular rage so slow in action? The next entry upon this subject is the following:—"on the 28th of April 1635, Sir John Harvey thrust out of his government, and Captain John West acts as governor, till the king's pleasure known."* * Hening v. I. 223. It appears from another ancient record† † List of governors: Hening, v. I. p. 4. that before the assembly met which was to have heard complaints against Harvey, he agreed in council to go to England to answer them, and upon that West was elected governor. How long West governed is uncertain, but it appears by a paper among the records that Harvey was governor again in January 1636. It appears that Charles regarded the conduct of the colony as an unwarrantable piece of insolence little short of treason, and would not even hear them least the spetacle of so noble an example might inflame the growing discontents in his own kingdom, which finally rose to such a pitch as not only to take the same unwarrantable liberty of deposing him, but even laid violent hands upon his sacred person. He accordingly sent the commissioners home with their grievances untold, and Harvey was re-instated in his power without undergoing even a trial. The conduct of the colony appears to have been a salutary lesson to him; and he probably feared that for the next offence they would take justice into their own hands; for we hear no complaints of him during his administration, which expired in November 1639. Sir Francis Wyatt succeeded him. 74 In 1634 the colony was divided into eight shires,* * Viz: James City, Henrico, Charles City, Elizabeth City, Warwick river, Warros quoyoke, Charles river and Accomack. which were to be governed as the shires in England, lieutenants were to be appointed in the same manner as in England, and it was their especial duty to pay attention to the war against the Indians. Sheriffs, Sergeants and Bailiffs were also to be elected as in England. In 1628-9 commissions were issued to hold monthly courts in the different settlements, which was the origin of our county court system.† † See Note A at the end of this chapter. At the first assembly which was held after the return of Wyatt, several acts were passed, which from the inattention of historians to the circumstances of the times, have received universal reprobation, but which when properly considered, will be found to be marked with great shrewdness and dictated by the soundest policy. The act declares that, "tobacco by reason of excessive quantities made, being so low, that the planters could not subsist by it, or be enabled to raise more staple commodities or pay their debts: therefore it was enacted that the tobacco of that year be viewed by sworn viewers, and the rotten and unmerchantable, and half the good to be burned. So the whole quantity made would come to 1,500,000 lbs. without stripping and smoothing; and the next two years 170 pounds tobacco per poll, stript and smoothed, was to be made, which would make in the whole about 1,300,000 lbs. and all creditors were to take 40 lbs. for a hundred." By a second act it was declared that, "no man should be obliged to perform above half his covenants about freighting tobacco in 1639." Nothing could be more absurd than such acts at the present day, and hence they have been pronounced absurd at that time. But let us look to the circumstances. Except the little tobacco made in the Somer Isles, Virginia at that time had the monopoly of the English market. The taste for tobacco was new, existed with few and could not be suddenly extended; consequently the consumption could not be increased in proportion to the increase of supply, but those who used it would obtain it at a price proportionably less. Thus a superabundant supply so glutted the market as to reduce the article to a price ruinous to the planters. On the other hand with those who had acquired a taste for tobacco, it was nearly indispensable, and if less than a usual crop was made the demand enhanced the value of the remainder beyond that of the full crop, hence the propriety of burning half of the good tobacco. This seems to have been perceived, and we have seen no fault found with the first portion of the act, but the latter part, forcing creditors to take less than their full dues, has been pronounced flagrantly unjust. But if this had not been done what would have been the condition of the planter? If he had made a hundred pounds, and owed fifty, the burning and his creditor would deprive him of his whole crop, whilst the creditor receiving the fity pounds at its enhanced value, would receive more than double what was due him. This would have been highly oppressive to the debtor, and made the whole act redound entirely to the benefit of the creditor. Whereas making him take 40 pounds in the hundred, when that 40 was enhanced to more than the value of the hundred, was no hardship. In the early stages of the colony, the planters wanted the comforts of life from England and not money, for money could purchase nothing in America. It would have been wasteful extravagance to have brought it. The Virginians had but one article of export,—all trading vessels came for tobacco,—hence that would purchase every thing, and became on that account useful to every man and an article of universal desire as money is in other countries, and hence the standard of value and circulating medium of the colony. We find when money first began to be introduced, as the keeping accounts in tobacco was inconvenient to the foreign merchants who came to trade, an act was passed with the following preamble.— —"Whereas it hath been the usual custom of merchants and others dealing intermutually in this colony, to make all bargains, contracts, and to keep all accounts in tobacco, and not in money," &amp;c. It then goes on to enact that in future they should be kept in money, and that in all pleas and actions the value should be represented in money. This was in 1633.* * Hening, v. I. p. 216. But it was found so inconvenient to represent value by an arbitrary standard, the representative of which did not exist in the colony, that another act was passed in January 1641, declaring that,—"Whereas many and great inconveniences do daily arise by dealing for money, Be it enacted and confirmed by the authority of this present Grand Assembly, that all money debts made since the 26th day of March, 1642, or which hereafter shall be made, shall not be pleadable or recoverable in any court of justice under this government."† † Henning, v. I. p. 262. An exception was afterwards made in 1642-3, in favor of debts contracted for horses or sheep,‡ ‡ Ibid. 268. but money debts generally were not even made recoverable again until 1656.? ? Ibid. 417. We thus see that tobacco was the currency, and an excess as injurious as an over issue of bank paper, depreciating itself in the market, or in common parlance causing every thing to rise. We see moreover the cause of the excessive care taken in burning bad tobacco, since that was as important to the uniformity of their currency as the exclusion of counterfeits in a money currency. All the viewings, censorships, inspections, regulations of the amount to be cultivated by each planter, each hand,—the quantity to be gathered from each plant,—the regulations prescribed as to curing it,—are to be regarded more as mint regulations than as regulations of agricultural industry. Indeed we find the attempt to sell or pay bad tobacco is made a crime precisely as it is now to sell or pay counterfeit money.§ § Henning, v. I. p. 152. This act of Assembly then allowed debtors to discharge themselves by paying half their debts in amount, did in effect make them pay all in value, and can by no means be compared to the acts of states or princes in debasing the coin and allowing it to retain its old nominal value, or by introducing valueless paper money; in these cases, the debt is paid nominally or in words but not in value, whereas in Virginia it was not paid nominally as it had been contracted for so many pounds of tobacco, but it was paid in fewer pounds rendered of greater actual value than the debt would have amounted to if paid in pounds before the burning of half the quantity made.¶ ¶ We are sorry to see even Mr. Bancroft (p.218.) censuring this as an act of injustice, and comparing it with debasing the coin. In order to account for the Act he even casts a slur upon the Council and Assembly, and says, "Probably the members of the Legislature and the Council were themselves much in debt." If they had passed the burning act without the other clause one might well have supposed them large creditors, since it would have more than doubled in value what was due to them, whilst the amount in pounds would have remained the same. In short the act would have been to make every planter loose the tobacco burned, and his creditors get the advantage of the burning. Wyatt remained governor only for one year and a few months, when he was succeeded by Sir William Berkeley. Historians who have not been aware of the intermediate administration of Wyatt, and have heard no complaint of Berkeley, have delighted to deck his character in the gayest colors, in contrast to the black character which they have drawn of Harvey. There can be no doubt that he was esteemed an accomplished and chivalric gentleman; but his accession brought no increase of political freedom to Virginia, and his commission did not differ from those of his predecessors. On the contrary the instructions which he brought, so far from granting new franchises, imposed new, severe, and unwarrantable restrictions on the liberty of trade, England claiming that monopoly of colonial commerce, which was ultimately enforced by the navigation act, and which was a perpetual source of contention, until all differences were finally healed by the revolution.* * Bancroft, V. I. p. 219. Berkeley arrived in February, 1642; an assembly met in March, and soon after passed a solemn protest against a petition which Sir George Sandys had presented to Parliament for the restoration of the company. This paper is drawn with great ability, and sets forth the objections to the petition in very strong and striking terms. They enlarge especially upon the wish and power of the company to monopolise their trade, the advantages and happiness secured to them by their present form of government, with its annual assemblies and trial by jury; the fact that a restitution of the power of the company would be an admission of the illegality of the king's authority and a consequent nullification of the grants and commissions issued by him; and the impossibility of men, however wise, at such a distance and unacquainted with the climate or condition of the country, to govern the colony as well as it could be governed by their own Grand Assembly.† † Hening, V. I. p. 231-4. The king in reply to this declared his purpose not to change a form of government in which they received so much content and satisfaction. Other important matters were settled at this legislature. A tax for the benefit of the governor was abolished. The punishment by condemnation to temporary service was abolished, which had existed ever since the foundation of the colony; and this protection to liberty was considered as so important to the Assembly that they declared it was to be considered as a record by the inhabitants of their birthright as Englishmen, and that the oppression of the late company was quite extinguished. The governor probably received some benefit from these considerations, for he is praised for giving his assent to an act in which he preferred the public freedom to his particular profit. A nearer approach was made to the laws and customs of England in proceedings of courts and trials of causes. Better regulations were prescribed for discussing and deciding land titles. The bounds of parishes were more accurately marked. A treaty with Maryland, opening the trade of the Chesapeake was matured; and peace with the Indians confirmed. Taxes were proportioned more to men's estates and abilities than to the numbers, by which the poor were much relieved, "but which through the strangeness thereof could not but require much time and debating." They published a list of their acts in order to show to the colony that they had not swerved from "the true intent of their happy constitution," which required them to "enact good and wholesome laws, and rectify and relieve such disorders and grievances as are incident to all states and republics; but that their late consultations would redound greatly to the benefit of the colony and their posterity." In the conclusion of that list they state that the gracious inclination of his majesty, ever ready to protect them, and now more particularly assured to them, together with the concurrence of a happy parliament in England,—were the motives which induced them to take this opportunity to "establish their liberties and privileges and settle their estates often before assaulted and threatened, and lately invaded by the corporation; and to prevent the future designs of monopolizers, contractors, and preemptors, ever usurping the benefit of their labors; and they apprehended that no time could be misspent, or labor misplaced in gaining a firm peace to themselves and posterity, and a future immunity and ease to themselves from taxes and impositions, which they expected to be the fruits of their endeavors." The Indians had been driven back, and weakened by a perpetual succession of hostilities from the time of the great massacre until the year 1644. During the latter years of this period we have little account of their proceedings, but the rapid increase of the settlements had driven them from the rich borders of the rivers in the lower country higher into the interior, and the new grants were every day driving them still further from the homes of their fathers. This incessant warfare, whilst it weakened them as a nation, had increased their cunning and skill in partisan warfare. Ope- 1644. chancanough, though now so old that he had to be carried in a litter, and so feeble that he could not raise his eyelids without assistance, still retained sufficient strength of mind to embody a combination of the various tribes under his control, and make a sudden and violent attack upon many of the frontier settlements at once. Little is known of the circumstances attending this second great massacre. An act of Assembly of 1645, making the eighteenth day of April a holyday and day of thanksgiving, for escape from the Indians, marks the period of the massacre. Other evidence makes the number of their victims three hundred.* * Bancroft, p. 224—Burke, V. II, p. 55, says—on authority of Beverley—"five hundred." The precautions which the whites had been taught to take by the previous massacre, in trading with them only at particular places, in always going armed, in never admitting them to the same familiarity, effectually prevented them, with all their caution in approach, and violence of attack, from committing as great slaughter as they had upon the former occasion. The whites do not seem to have been stricken with a panic now as formerly, but quickly sallied upon their assailants, and drove them back so rapidly that their venerable chieftain himself had to be deserted by his attendants, and was taken by Sir William Berkeley, at the head of a squadron of light cavalry. He was carried to Jamestown, and manifested in his imprisonment the same haughty dignity which had always distinguished him. He preserved a proud and disdainful silence, and such indifference to the passing scenes, that he rarely requested his eyelids to be raised. In this melancholy condition, he was basely shot in the back by his sentinel, with whom recollection of former injuries overcame all respect for helpless age, or former greatness. The only subject which called forth any show of regret from him was a flash of angry indignation, at being exposed in his dying hours to the idle and curious gaze of his enemies. So little regard was now paid to the Indian hostilities, that on the following June, Sir William Berkeley sailed for England, and the council elected Richard Kemp to occupy his post until his return. In the mean time, the warfare with the Indians continued without remission. It appears by an act of the latter part of the year 1644, that many of the inhabitants, probably on the frontiers, had been collected in large bodies; but leave was then given them to dispose of themselves "for their best advantage and convenience, provided that in places of danger, there should not be less than ten men allowed to settle."* * Hening, p. 285-6. Sir William Berkeley again took possession of his government in June, 1645. And in the following year a treaty of peace was con- Oct. 5, 1646. cluded with the Indians, by which Necotowance the successor of Opechancanough, acknowledged that he held his kingdom of the crown of England, and agreed that his successors should be appointed or confirmed by the king's governor; on the other hand the Assembly on behalf of the colony, undertook to protect him against rebels and all enemies whatsoever. In this treaty the Indians were permitted to dwell on the north side of York river, but ceded to the whites all the country from the falls of the James and York to the bay, forever; and any Indian coming upon that territory was to suffer death unless he bore the badge of a messenger. The Indians were also to surrender all prisoners, negroes, and arms taken. Other articles were added prescribing the form of intercourse.† † Hening, V. I. p. 323, 326. Thus were the Aborigines at length finally excluded from their father-land, leaving no monument of their having existed, save the names of the waters and mountains, and the barrows containing the ashes of their ancestors.‡ ‡ I know of no such thing existing as an Indian monument—of labor on the large scale—I think there is no remain as respectable as would be a common ditch for the draining of lands; unless indeed it would be the barrows, of which many are to be found all over the country.—That they were repositories of the dead has been obvious to all; but on what particular occasion constructed, was a matter of doubt.—Jefferson's Notes on Va., p. 132. Thus the colony of Virginia acquired the management of all its concerns; war was levied, and peace concluded, and territory acquired, in conformity to the acts of the representatives of the people; whilst the people of the mother country, had just acquired these privileges after a long and bloody conflict with their former sovereign. Possessed of security and quiet, abundance of land, a free market for their staple, and practically, all the rights of an independent state, having England for its guardian against foreign oppression, rather than its ruler, the colonists enjoyed all the prosperity which a virgin soil, equal laws, and general uniformity of condition and industry, could bestow. Their numbers increased; the cottages were filled with children, as the ports were with ships and emigrants. At Christmas, 1648, there were trading in Virginia, ten ships from London, two from Bristol, twelve Hollanders, and seven from New England. The number of the colonists was already twenty thousand; and they, who had sustained no griefs, were not tempted to engage in the feuds by which the mother country was divided. They were attached to the cause of Charles, not because they loved monarchy, but because they cherished the lib- 1649. erties of which he had left them in the undisturbed possession; and after his execution, though there were not wanting some who favored republicanism, the government recognised his son without dispute.* * Hening, V. 1, p. 359-60. Act 1. The loyalty of the Virginians did not escape the attention of the royal exile; from his retreat in Breda he transmitted to Berkeley a June, 1650. new commission, and Charles the Second, a fugitive from England, was still the sovereign of Virginia.† † Bancroft, V. I, 225-6. But the Parliament did not long permit its authority to be denied. Having, by the vigorous energy and fearless enthusiasm of republicanism, triumphed over all its enemies in Europe, it turned its attention to the colonies; and a memorable ordinance at once empowered the council of state to reduce the rebellious colonies to obedience, and at the same time, established it as a law, that foreign ships should not trade at any of the ports "in Barbadoes, Antigua, Bermudas and Virginia." Thus giving the first example of that wholesale blockade afterwards rendered so notorious by the celebrated orders in council during the wars of the French revolution. Maryland, which was not expressly included in the ordinance, had taken care to acknowledge the new order of things; and Massachusetts, alike unwilling to encounter the hostility of parliament, and jealous of the rights of independent legislation, by its own enactment, prohibited all intercourse with Virginia till the supremacy of the commonwealth should be established; although the order, when it was found to be injurious to commerce, was promptly repealed, even while royalty still flourished at Jamestown.‡ ‡ Bancroft, V. I, p. 226-7. A powerful fleet with a considerable body of land forces on board, sent out to bring the colonies to submission, having subdued Barbadoes and Antigua, cast anchor before James Town. Sir William Berkeley and his hardy colonists had not been inactive, the growing strength of the colony had recently been increased by the acquisition of many veteran cavaliers from the king's army, and it now presented no comtemptible force. Several Dutch ships which were lying in the river, and which as trading contrary to the prohibition of Parliament, were armed to provide against surprise by the commonwealth's fleets, were also pressed into service. This show of resistance induced the commissioners of Parliament to hesitate, before they attempted to reduce the colony to obedience by force; and to offer them fair and honorable terms of submission. The terms offered being such as completely satisfied the Virginians that their freedom was to be preserved inviolate, and their present happy constitution guaranteed, whilst they were to suffer nothing for past conduct, readily acquiesced, since they gained all by such a surrender which they could effect by the most successful warfare. It appears that they never anticipated anything more than the preservation of their own liberties from wanton violation from the new and untried power which now held the reins of government in England; and could scarcely have been mad enough to hope to effect anything favorable to the king by their resistance.? ? We have differed from Bancroft upon this subject, who says, p. 204, "No sooner had the Guinea frigate anchored in the waters of the Chesapeake, than `all thoughts of resistance were laid aside,' [Clarendon, B. XIII. p. 466, 467.] and the colonists having no motive to contend for a monarch, whose fortunes seemed irretreivable, were earnest only to assert the freedom of their own institutions." There can be no doubt but Burke, vol. II. p. 82, drew largely upon his imagination for the brilliant colors in which he paints Berkeley's attitude of resistance, the outline of the picture he probably found in his ancient records. The authority upon which we rest is the act of indemnity itself (Hening, p. 367.) issued by the Parliamentary commissioners, —that act recites that having brought a fleet and force before James Cittie in Virginia, to reduce that colony under the obedience of the commonwealth of England, and finding force raised by the governor and country to make opposition against the said fleet, whereby assured danger appearing of the ruin and destruction of the plantation, for prevention whereof the Burgesses of all the several plantations being called to advise and assist therein, upon long and serious debate, [during which we must suppose the hostile attitude was continued,] and in sad contemplation of the great miseries and certain destruction, which were so nearly hovering over this whole country," &amp;c.—We suppose there might have been also some little danger to the commonwealth's men and ships. The articles of surrender are concluded between the commissioners of the commonwealth, and the council of state, and Grand Assembly of Virginia; as equal treating with equal. It secures:— 1st. That this should be considered a voluntary act, not forced or constrained by a conquest upon the country; and that the colonists should have and enjoy such freedoms and privileges as belong to the freeborn people of England. 2dly. That the Grand Assembly as formerly should convene and transact the affairs of Virginia; doing nothing contrary to the government of the commonwealth or laws of England: 3dly. That there should be a full and total remission of all acts, words or writings against the Parliament: 4thly. That Virginia should have her ancient bounds and limits granted by the charters of the former kings, and that a new charter was to be sought from Parliament to that effect, against such as had trespassed upon their ancient rights:—[This clause would seem to be aimed at some of the neighboring colonies.] 5thly. That all patents of land under the seal of the colony, granted by the governor, should remain in full force: 6thly. That the privilege of fifty acres of land for every person emigrating to the colony should remain in full force: 7thly. That the people of Virginia have free trade, as the people of England enjoy with all places and nations, according to the laws of the commonwealth, and that Virginia should enjoy equal privileges in every respect with any other colony in America: 8thly. That Virginia should be free from all taxes, customs and impositions whatsoever, and that none should be imposed upon them without the consent of their Grand Assembly. And no forts or castle be erected, or garrisons maintained without their consent: 9thly. That no charge should be required from the country on account of the expence incurred in the present fleet: 10thly. That this agreement should be tendered to all persons, and that such as should refuse to subscribe to it, should have a years time to remove themselves and effects from Virginia, and in the meantime enjoy equal justice. The remaining articles were of less importance. This was followed by a supplemental treaty, for the benefit of the governor and council, and such soldiers as had served against the commonwealth in England; allowing them the most favorable terms. If this was a conquest,—happy would it be for most colonies to be conquered; every privilege was secured which could possibly be asked, and the liberties of the colony were established more thoroughly than they had ever been, and the conquest was only less favorable to Virginia than her declaration of independence, by having her rights depending upon the pledged faith of another nation, instead of having them entirely under her own control. The correspondence between the rights now secured, and the rights mentioned in the Declaration of Independence as violated by the British king, is remarkable. All matters were thus happily and amicably arranged, and as Sir William Berkeley was too loyal a subject to be willing to take office under Parliament,—Richard Bennett, one of the commissioners was elected governor. A council was also elected with powers to act in conformity to the instructions they should receive from the Parliament, the known law of England, and the Acts of Assembly, and such other powers as the Assembly should think proper from time to time to give them. It was declared at the same session that it was best that officers should be elected by the Burgesses, "the representatives of the people;" and after discussion upon the propriety of allowing the governor and council to be members of the Assembly, it was determined that they might, by taking the same oath which was taken by the Burgesses. The Assembly thus having no written constitution as their guide, took upon themselves the office of a convention of the people, and granted or resumed powers as it might seem best for the good of the country. The whites and the remnants of the neighboring Indian tribes continued to be upon good terms, and the latter were kindly and humanely treated by the guardian care of the Assembly. A slight irruption of the Rappahannocks, seems to have been soon terminated. But a new scene in the history of the colony now presented itself. The Rechahecrians, a fierce and warlike tribe came down from the mountains and took up a strong position on the falls of James river, with six or seven hundred warriors. This excited no little uneasiness, as it had been very difficult to extirpate the Indians who had formerly possessed the spot. The first expedition against them failed, a new one was prepared and the subject Indians being called upon for aid furnished a hundred warriors, most of whom with their chief Totopotomoi, fell fighting gallantly.* * Burk, vol. 2. 104-106. When Bennett retired from office, and the Assembly elected Edward Digges his successor. The commissioners of the commonwealth March 31, 1655. had little to do with controling the destinies of Virginia, but were engaged in settling the affairs and adjusting the boundaries, of Maryland. The Assembly reciting the articles of Agreement with the commissioners of Parliament, which admitted that the election of all March 13, 1658. officers of the colony appertained to the Burgesses, the representatives of the people proceeded to the election of a governor and council until the next Assembly; and the choice fell upon "worthy Samuel Matthews, an old planter, of nearly forty years standing, a most deserving commonwealth's man, who kept a good house, lived bravely, and was a true lover of Virginia."† † Bancroft, v. I. p. 243—quoting II. M. Hist. Coll. v. IX. p. 119. But this worthy old gentleman seems to have conceived higher ideas of his powers than the Assembly was willing to allow. The Assembly had determined not to dissolve itself, but only to adjourn until the first of November.‡ ‡ Hening, v. I. 497. They then proceeded with their 75 ordinary business; making however one important change in the constitution, which was to require that all propositions and laws presented by a committee should be first discussed by the House of Burgesses in private, before the admission of the governor and council. The governor and council on the first of April sent a message declaring that they thought fit then to dissolve the Assembly, and requiring the speaker to dismiss the Burgesses. To this the Assembly returned for answer that the act was illegal, and without precedent, and requested a revocation of it, as they expected speedily to finish their business. The house then declared than any member who should depart should be censured as betraying the trust reposed in him by his country; and that the remainder should act in all things and to all intents and purposes as an entire house; that the Speaker should sign nothing without the consent of a majority of the House, and that the members should take an oath not to disclose the acts or debates of that body. The governor replied to the communication from the house, that he was willing that the house would conclude its business speedily, and refer the dispute as to the legality of his power to dissolve, to the decision of the Lord Protector. The House unanimously decided this answer to be unsatisfactory; expressed an earnest desire that public business might be soon despatched, and requested the governor and council to declare the house undissolved, in order that a speedy period might be put to public affairs. In reply to this the governor and council revoked the order of dissolution upon their promise of a speedy conclusion, and again referred the matter of disputed right to the Lord Protector. The House still unsatisfied with this answer appointed a committee to draw up a report in vindication of the conduct of the Assembly and in support of its power. In the report the Burgesses declare that they have in themselves full power of election and appointment of all officers in the country, until they should have an order to the contrary from the supreme power in England; that the house of Burgesses, the representatives of the people, were not dissolvable by any power yet extant in Virginia, except their own; that the former election of governor and council was null, and that in future no one should be admitted a councillor unless he was nominated, appointed and confirmed by the house of Burgesses. They then directed an order to the sheriff of James City county, who was their sergeant at-arms, that he should execute no warrant, precept or command directed to him by any other power or person than the Speaker of the House. They then ordered that "as the supreme power of the country of Virginia had been declared resident in the Burgesses," the secretary of state should be required to deliver up the public records to the Speaker. An oath was prescribed for the governor and council to take, and the same governor was elected and most of the same council. Thus were all difficulties adjusted, and popular sovereignty fully established. Upon the death of Cromwell, the House of Burgesses unanimously recognized his son Richard and adopted an address praying a Mar., 1659. confirmation of their former privileges, in which address the governor was required to join, after solemnly acknowleding in the presence of the whole Assembly, that the supreme power of electing officers was by the present laws resident in the Grand Assembly;* * Hening, v. I. p. 512. which was alleged to be required for this reason, that what was their privilege now might belong to their posterity hereafter. Matthews died, leaving the colony of Virginia without a governor, about the same time that the resignation of Richard Cromwell March, 1660 left England without a head. In this emergency the Assembly reciting that the late frequent distractions in England preventing any power from being generally confessed; that the supreme power of the colony should be vested in the Assembly, and that all writs should issue in its name, until such a command and commission should come from England as should by the Assembly be adjudged lawful.* * Henning, v. I. p. 530. Sir William Berkeley was then elected governor, with the express stipulation that he should call an Assembly once in two years at least, and should not dissolve the Assembly without its own consent. This old royalist probably thinking now that there was a prospect of the restoration, accepted the office under the prescribed conditions, and acknowledged himself to be but the servant of the Assembly. During the suspension of the royal government in England, Virginia attained unlimited liberty of commerce, which they regulated by independent laws. The ordinance of 1650 was rendered void by the act of capitulation; the navigation act of Cromwell was not designed for her oppression, and was not enforced within her borders. Only one confiscation appears to have taken place, and that was entirely by the authority of the Grand Assembly. The war between England and Holland necessarily interrupted the intercourse of the Dutch with the English colonies; but if after the treaty of peace the trade was considered contraband, the English restrictions were entirely disregarded. Commissioners were sent to England to undeceive Cromwell with regard to the course Virginia had 1655. taken with reference to the boundary of Maryland, with regard to which he had been misinformed; and to present a remonstrance demanding unlimited freedom of trade; which it appears was not refused, for some months before the Protector's death, the Virginians invited the "Dutch and all foreigners" to trade with them on payment of no higher duty, than that which was levied on such English vessels, as were bound for a foreign port. Proposals of peace and commerce between New-Netherlands and Virginia were discussed without scruple by the respective colonial governments; and at last a special statute of Virginia extended to every christian nation, in amity with England, a promise of liberty of trade and equal justice.† † Ibid. v. I. p. 450. Act XVI. At the restoration, Virginia enjoyed freedom of commerce with the 1660. whole world. Virginia was the first state in the world, composed of separate townships, diffused over an extensive surface, where the government was organized on the principle of universal suffrage. All freemen without 1655. exception were entitled to vote. The right of suffrage was once restricted, but it was soon after determined to be "hard and unagree- 1656. able to reason, that any person shall pay equal taxes and yet have no vote in the election;" and the electoral franchise was restored to all freemen. Servants, when the time of their bondage was completed, at once became electors; and might be chosen burgesses. Thus Virginia established upon her soil the supremacy of the popular branch, the freedom of trade, the independence of religious societies, the security from foreign taxation, and the universal elective franchise. If in the following years she departed from either of these principles, and yielded a reluctant consent to change, it was from the influence of foreign authority. Virginia had herself established a nearly independent democracy. Prosperity advanced with freedom; dreams of new staples and infinite wealth were indulged; while the population of Virginia at the epoch of the restoration may have been about thirty thousand. Many of the recent emigrants had been royalists in England, good officers in the war, men of education, of property, and of condition. But the waters of the Atlantic divided them from the political strifes of Europe; their industry was employed in making the best advantage of their plantations; the interests and liberties of Virginia, the land which they adopted as their country, were dearer to them than the monarchical principles, which they had espoused in England; and therefore no bitterness could exist between the partizans of the Stuarts and the friends of republican liberty. Virginia had long been the home of its inhabitants—"Among many other blessings," said their statute book, "God Almighty hath vouchsafed increase of children to this colony; who are now multiplied to a considerable number;" and the huts in the wilderness were as full as the bird's nests of the woods. The genial climate and transparent atmosphere delighted those, who had come from the denser air of England. Every object in nature was new and wonderful. The hospitality of the Virginians became proverbial. Labor was valuable; land was cheap; competence promptly followed industry. There was no need of a scramble; abundance gushed from the earth for all. The morasses were alive with water fowl; the forests were nimble with game, the woods rustled with covies of quail and wild turkies, while they sung with the merry notes of the singing birds; and hogs swarming like vermin, ran at large in troops. It was "the best poor man's country in the world." "If a happy peace be settled in poor England," it had been said "then they in Virginia shall be as happy a people as any under heaven." But plenty encouraged indolence. No domestic manufactures were established; every thing was imported from England. The chief branch of industry, for the purpose of exchanges, was tobacco planting; and the spirit of invention was enfeebled by the uniformity of pursuit.* * Bancroft's History of the United States, vol. I. p. 246, 252. In taking leave of this delightful author, whose work has not yet progressed beyond the first volume, we must make an apology for borrowing in this chapter more perhaps than was fair. But our extreme haste, writing against time, whilst the press is in operation and the printer's devil taking his copy from under our pen before the ink is dry,—must be our apology for using his copious references, and even his language when we find it precisely applicable to our purpose, expressed as it is with more ease and beauty than we could ever attain whatever time might be at our disposal. The use we make of his work, whilst it will be a great benefit to our readers, cannot be an injury to him, but may be a service in making his work known to many who would not otherwise be aware of its merit, or perhaps its existence. We have a very high authority for a much more extensive system of quotation, in the use made by Judge Marshall of Dr. Robertson's posthumous chapters on Virginia. Our haste must be our apology also for the use of a review of the early legislation of Virginia from the preface of Hening's Statutes at Large, which we give below. It presents a connected view of several matters of legislation which we had not time to interweave into the text; our comments upon others, and our reasons for differing from the generally received opinion of their impropriety are given in the text. NOTE A. See p. 585.—From the settlement of the colony to the death of Charles I. and the commencement of the commonwealth thereupon, an uniformity to the doctrines and discipline of the church of England was strictly enjoined; all non-conformists were compelled to leave the colony, with all convenience; popish recusants were disabled from holding any office, and their priests not suffered to remain more than five days in the country. During the commonwealth, the affairs of the church were left to the discretion of the parishioners, but no sooner did the Quakers, who had fled from the persecutions in England, arrive on our shores than they were met by the terrors of an act "for suppressing them;* * It will be seen by reference to the preamble of this act, that these people were not persecuted for religious opinion, but improper conduct "Whereas there is an vnreasonable and turbulent sort of people, commonly called Quakers, who contrary to the law do dayly gather together vnto them vnlaw'll Assemblies and congregations of people teaching and publishing, lies, miracles, false visions, prophecies and doctrines, which have influence vpon the comunities of men both ecclesiasticall and civil endeavouring and attempting thereby to destroy religion, lawes, comunities and all bonds of civil societie, leaveing it arbitrarie to everie vaine and vitious person whether men shall be safe, lawes established, offenders punished, and Governours rule, hereby disturbing the publique peace and just interest, to prevent and restraine which mischiefe, It is enacted, &amp;c."—Ed. Gaz. masters of vessels were subjected to a penalty of one hundred pounds sterling for each Quaker brought into the colony; all Quakers were imprisoned without bail or mainprize, till they found sufficient security to depart the colony: for returning they were directed to be proceeded against as contemners of the laws and magistracy, and punished accordingly; and if they should come in a third time they were to be prosecuted as felons. All persons were prohibited, under the penalty of one hundred pounds sterling, from entertaining them, or permitting their assemblies in or near their houses; and no person was permitted to dispose of, or publish, any books or pamphlets containing the tenets of their religion. It is worthy of observation that a similar principle to that which has obtained in Kentucky with respect to compensation for improvements made upon lands by one man, the title of which appeared, from investigation, to be in another, existed in a law of Virginia, so long ago as the year 1643. And as this law has never before been published, we can only account for the coincidence, by supposing that mankind, in every age, placed in similar situations, will generally pursue the same course. The act, after reciting that many suits had been commenced, founded on controversies relating to land, "to the great trouble and molestation of the whole colony," goes on to declare, that if any man should settle on a tract of land, which, on a just survey, should prove to be the property of another, a valuable consideration should be allowed by the judgment of twelve men upon oath, to the first who seated it, for clearing and improving it; but if the charge should amount to more than the real owner was willing to give, the person in possession was bound to keep the land, and pay the owner what it should be judged by twelve men to be worth, "before the seating thereof;" and, of course, without regard to the improvements. An exception was made in favor of orphans; and afterwards a further proviso, that an allowance for "building and clearing" should not be made to those who had "lawful warning" of a prior right. About the same period (1643) the assembly passed an act directing that all process against debtors lately arrived from England (except where the debts were contracted for goods purchased in England, or for the accommodation of planters returning to this country,) should be suspended. This act is introduced by a lengthy preamble, assigning reasons which fully satisfied the minds of the legislature as to the policy and even justice of the measure. These laws had an obvious tendency to increase the population, and promote the improvement of the country; by rendering the persons of many of the inhabitants free from restraint, and by securing to every man the fruits of his labor. The culture of tobacco seems to have been a favorite object with the first settlers, and was the only staple commodity to which they could be induced to turn their attention. In order to improve its quality various laws were passed limiting the number of plants to be cultivated by each hand, and the leaves to be gathered from a plant. Other details in the process of making it, were also prescribed by the legislature; and to insure a just compensation for the labor of the planter, the price at which it was to be sold was fixed by the assembly, at different times. The first idea of inspecting tobacco is contained in an act passed in 1630, before any warehouses were established. The process was very simple, and the penalty for offering unmerchantable tobacco in payment equally severe. If a planter offered to pay away, or barter any bad tobacco, the commander of the plantation (an officer who united with the powers of a justice of the peace, the supreme military command of the settlement) with two or three discreet men, were directed to view it, and if found of bad quality, to cause it to be burnt; and the owner was prohibited from planting any more tobacco until authorized by the General Assembly. At the next session the law was amended so as to make it the duty of the commander to issue his order either verbally or in writing to two "sufficient men" to view the tobacco, who were, in like manner, to burn it, if of bad quality. The same law was re-enacted in the revisal of 1632. In 1633, warehouses (then called storehouses) were established, and the inspectors were to be composed of that member of the king's council, whose residence was nearest any warehouse, and the commissioners of the several plantations, as assistants. To prevent the recurrence of a scarcity of corn, which had been severely felt in the colony, each master of a family was compelled to plant and sufficiently tend, two acres a head, for each laboring person in his family; and as an encouragement to cultivate that article, the price was not to be limited, but every planter might sell it as dear as he could. Nor does it appear that the legislature ever interfered with the exportation of corn, or restricted the price, except in times of pressing want. In the year 1630, the contents of a barrel of corn were fixed at five bushels, Winchester measure, and has so continued to the present day. Various and severe laws were very early enacted against forestalling and ingrossing imported articles, but their inefficacy having been experienced, they were all repealed and a free trade allowed. The administration of justice, in Virginia, was originally extremely cheap, and simple in its details. Commanders of plantations held monthly courts for the trial of civil actions, not exceeding the value of one hundred pounds of tobacco, and for the punishment of petty offences, reserving the right of appeal to the quarter court held by the governor and council, which possessed the supreme judicial power, under the different charters, and had original jurisdiction in all cases whatsoever. Commissioners of monthly courts succeeded to commanders of plantations, with the like jurisdiction in civil cases; which was afterwards extended to five pounds sterling. The jurisdiction of the court was further extended to sixteen hundred pounds of tobacco, and they were to be called county instead of monthly courts; and that of a single magistrate was final as far as twenty shillings sterling. In consequence of the great distance of many of the counties from James City, where the quarter courts were held, jurisdiction was finally given to the county courts, in all cases of law and equity, and the trial by jury secured to those who desired it. The decision of the county court was, at first, final as far as sixteen hundred pounds of tobacco, and for all sums above that an appeal was allowed to the quarter court, and from thence to the assembly; which afterwards had jurisdiction of appeals in all cases, of whatever amount. Besides the general jurisdiction of the county and quarter courts, special provision was made for certain counties and settlements where it was considered too inconvenient to the people to attend at the usual place of holding courts. The leading principle seems to have been to carry justice to the doors of the inhabitants. Thus, the county court of Northampton, "on account of its remoteness from James City," had final jurisdiction as far as three thousand two hundred pounds of tobacco; one commissioner on the South side of the river in James City county, was vested with the powers of a county court; the inhabitants of Appamattook or Bristol parish, were also authorised to hold courts, with the right of appeal to Henrico or Charles City county courts. Two courts were permitted to be held in Northampton; two in Isle of Wight; and two in Charles City. As the population of the county increased, and new counties were formed, these special courts were abolished. In the year 1643, the first act passed for regulating lawyers; though they had certainly attended the several courts before that period. By the first law on the subject, no attorney was permitted to plead, without a license; which was grantable by the court in which he practised; nor could an attorney have a license from more courts than the quarter, and one county court,—Their fees were twenty pounds of tobacco, in the county, and fifty pounds in the quarter court: and no attorney could refuse to be retained unless employed on the other side. In 1645, all mercenary attornies were expelled from office: In 1647, that act was amended by adding a clause to it declaring that no attornies should take any fees; and if the court should perceive that either party, by his weakness, was likely to lose his cause, they themselves should either open the case or "appoint some fit man out of the people," to plead the cause, and allow him a reasonable compensation: no other attornies were admitted. In 1656, the act prohibiting attornies was repealed; the governor and council were authorised to license them for the quarter courts, and the commissioners for the county courts, and if any controversy should arise concerning their fees, it was to be settled by the courts respectively. In 1657-8, the law against mercenary attornies, was again revived. An inspection of the different fee bills will shew the simplicity of judicial proceedings, and the small compensation allowed to the officers of court. The first officers whose fees were established by law, were the secretary who was clerk of the quarter court, and the marshall, who executed the same duties which devolved upon the sheriff, after the appointment of that officer, which was not until the year 1634. The fees of clerks and sheriffs embraced but few objects, and were very moderate. Clerks of county courts were, at one time, appointed by the governor, but afterwards by the courts themselves. Commissioners of county courts, (the same as justices of the peace) were formerly appointed by the governor, afterwards by act of assembly; but at the commencement of the commonwealth they were appointed by the house of burgesses; afterwards they were recommended by their courts, and commissioned by the governor and council, and finally their appointment was confirmed by the assembly. During the same period the county courts recommended three or more to the governor and council, out of which they made a selection for sheriffs, who were to continue in office for one year only. No representative government was ever instituted in which the principles of universal suffrage, and of full representation, were carried further than in Virginia. The right of suffrage was originally exercised by ALL freemen; who were not compellable to go from their plantations to vote for burgesses; but might give their suffrages by subscribing a paper. This mode having been attended with considerable inconvenience, it was provided that all future elections should be by plurality of voices present; and a fine was imposed on all free men, who should fail to attend at the time and place appointed for the election. The number of burgesses to a plantation or settlement (before the formation of counties) was unlimited; nor does it appear that, at that time, any particular qualifications were necessary. After counties were laid off, the number of representatives to a county remained without limitation, until November, 1645, when they were reduced to four to each county, except James City county, which might send five, and the city itself one; and the election was directed to be held where the county courts were, except in those places which were specially authorised by act of assembly to hold elections. These were certain parishes to which that privilege was granted; and it was afterwards extended to all parishes, they paying the expenses of their burgesses, as the counties in general were compelled to do in relation to theirs. At the March session, 1660-1, the number of burgesses was limited to two for each county, and one for James City, it being the metropolis. The first act which in the smallest degree abridged the right of suffrage, or prescribed the qualifications of the members, passed at the March session, 1654-5. By this act it was declared, that the persons who should be elected to serve in assembly be such, and no "other than such, as were persons of known integrity and of good conversation, and of the age of one and twenty years." That all house keepers, "whether freeholders, lease-holders, or otherwise tenants, should only be capable to elect burgesses;" provided that the term "house-keepers should extend no further than to one person in a family." At the next session, however, so much of this act as excluded ANY FREEMAN from voting was repealed: the assembly declaring "that they conceived it something hard and unagreeable to reason that any persons should pay equal taxes, and yet have no votes in election." In the revisal of 1657-8, the same principle is preserved; the right of suffrage being extended to "ALL persons inhabiting in the colony, that are FREE MEN." By an act of 1670, that right was, for the first time, confined to FREE HOLDERS only; and the necessity of this qualification was further enforced by instructions from king Charles II, to sir Wm. Berkeley, governor, in 1676: "You shall take care," says the second article of the instructions, "that the members of the assembly be elected, only by FREE HOLDERS, as being more agreeable to the custome of England, to which you are as nigh as conveniently you can to conform yourselfe." Bridges and ferries were at first established and maintained at public expense; but this being considered burthensome to the inhabitants of many of the counties, especially the poor, who seldom used them; the law, as to ferries, was repealed, and the county courts vested with power to establish ferries on the application of individuals, and fix their rates. The exclusive right of establishing ferries was afterwards resumed by the assembly; and having exercised it for a series of years, to the great interruption of other public business, the legislature at the session of 1806, restored to the county courts the power exercised by them so long ago as the year 1647. CHAPTER V. BACON'S REBELLION—HOSTILE DESIGNS OF THE FRENCH Indifference to change in England,—Navigation act,—Convicts,—Conspiracy detected,—Discontents,—Cessation from tobacco planting for one year,—Royal grants,—Virginia's remonstrance,—Success of deputies,—Indian hostilities,—Army raised and disbanded by governor,— People petition for an army,—elect Bacon commander,—he marches without commission and defeats Indians,—pursued by governor, who retreats on hearing of rising at James Town,—Governor makes concessions,—Bacon prisoner,—is pardoned.—People force commission from governor,—Bacon marches to meet Indians,—hears he is declared a rebel by Berkeley,—marches to meet him,—he flees to Accomac,—Convention called and free government established.—Bacon defeats the Indians,—Berkeley obtains possession of the shipping, and occupies James Town,—is beseiged by Bacon, and driven out,—James Town burnt.—Death of Bacon,—character of his enterprise.—Predatory warfare,—treaty between governor and his opponents,—Cruelty of Berkeley,—King's commissioners,—Departure of Berkeley and his death.—Acts of Assembly passed during Bacon's influence.—Conduct of king's commissioners,—Culpeper governor,—Discontents,—Conduct of Beverly.—Howard governor.—General conduct of Virginia and progress of affairs.—Plan of Callier for dividing the British colonies. As Virginia had provided for herself a government substantially free, the political changes in England could have little effect upon her repose, provided no attempt was made to interfere with the freedom of her trade, or her local government. She seemed content to be under the protection rather than control, of whatever power the people of England thought proper to place at the head of affairs, provided that power did not seek to extend the conceded authority. In this mood she had adhered to Charles I. until the Parliament by its commissioners promised a preservation of all her privileges; she acknowledged Cromwell upon a similar promise, and his son Richard under the same idea; upon his resignation she held herself aloof, thus proving how perfect and how independent was her own local government, until the voice of England should declare who should rule; and upon the accession of Charles II. she gave in her allegiance to him. As in all these British changes she remained unconcerned and unmoved, so the last caused neither extraordinary joy or regret. The colonists thus free from external sources of uneasiness, proceeded to legislate upon internal matters; providing rewards for the encouragement of silk and other staples; negociating with Carolina and Maryland for the adoption of uniform measures for the improvement of tobacco, and diminishing its quantity; and providing for the erection of public buildings, the improvement of James Town, and other subjects of general utility. Whilst the colonists were proceeding in this useful occupation they were alarmed by the intelligence of the reenaction of the navigation act, 1663. odious with new prohibitions, and armed with now penalties. The Virginians had long enjoyed a very beneficial trade with other countries besides England, and had early perceived its advantages, often urging the propriety of its continuance, and contending that "freedom of trade was the life of a commonwealth." But the object of the navigation act was to confine its trade exclusively to England, for the encouragement of English shipping and the emolument of English merchants, as well as the promotion of the king's revenue; without regard to the gross injury done to the colony by depriving her of the benefit of competition in her harbors. The colony remonstrated in vain, and continued boldly her trade with all such foreigners as would venture to encounter the risque of being taken by the English cruisers and encountering the penalties of the act. It appears to have been for some time the practice to send felons and other obnoxious persons to the colony, to expiate their offences by serving the planters for a term of years. At the restoration many of the veteran soldiers of Cromwell to whom it was anticipated the return of the ancien regime would not be particularly palatable, were shipped to Virginia to work off their spleen in the cultivation of tobacco. It appears that this new business was not as agreeable to them as they had found the psalmsinging and plundering of the royalists under the command of their devout leader; and they accordingly quickly organized an insurrection, by the operation of which they were to change places with such of their masters as were left alive by the process. But this out-breaking which seems to have been well planned and extensively organized, was prevented by the compunction of one of their associates, who disclosed the whole affair to the governor the evening before it was to have gone into effect; and adequate means were taken to prevent the design. Four of the con- Feb. 13. spirators were executed. But this evil of importing jail-birds as they were called, increased to such an extent that it was prohibited by the General Court in 1670, under severe penalties.* * Hening, v. II. p. 510. The increase in the amount of tobacco raised by the increase of the colony and the settlement of Maryland and Carolina, far outstripped the June 5, 1666, increase of taste for it, rapid as that was, and caused such a glut of the commodity that its price fell to an amount utterly ruinous to the planter. In this the exclusive privilege of purchase which England enjoyed, notwithstanding the extensive contraband trade, no doubt largely contributed; but this the planters could not prevent, and their only remaining resource was in diminishing the amount of tobacco raised. To effect this various schemes had been devised, but they were all liable to be evaded, and were if successful, too partial in their operation to effect the object desired. Nothing could be efficient, short of a total cessation from planting for one year, and this was at last accomplished after long negotiations with Maryland and Carolina. Many other staples had been recommended from time to time to the planters, and even encouraged by bounties and rewards, and this year it was thought would give them more leisure to attend to the subject. But it is not probable that many engaged in the occupations proposed, which required the investment of capital, the acquisition of skill, and the aid of time to render them profitable; and the year's leisure only served to increase the growing discontent, especially as towards its end Maryland began to be suspected of bad faith. 76 There were other causes of discontent which probably prevailed between different classes of society. Loud complaint was made of the manner in which taxes were levied, entirely on persons without regard to property, which as there must have been a very large class of poor free persons now existing from the frequent emancipation, and expiration of the terms of those who came over as servants, besides those who were free but poor when they came to the country, must have created considerable excitement. An effort was made to remedy this evil by laying a tax on property but ineffectually; the only result being a small export duty on tobacco, in aid of the general revenue. While the taxes bore thus hard upon the poorer portion of the community they also had just reason to complain of exclusion from the right of suffrage by an act of 1670, and from the Legislature, to which none but freeholders could be chosen; as well as of the enormous pay which the Burgesses appropriated to themselves, of one hundred and fifty pounds of tobacco per diem, and one hundred for their horses and servants. The forts were also complained of as a source of heavy expenditure without any benefit; their chief use indeed being rather injurious, as they kept off traders who violated the navigation acts. But these evils in domestic legislation were trivial compared with those produced by the criminal prodigality of Charles, who wantonly made exorbitant grants to his favorites of large tracts of lands, without a knowledge of localities, and consequently without regard to the claims or even the settlements of others. To cap the climax of royal munificence the gay monarch in perhaps a merry mood, granted to Lords Culpeper and Arlington the whole colony of Virginia for thirty-one years, with privileges effectually royal, as far as the colony was concerned, only reserving some mark of homage to himself. This might be considered at court perhaps as a small bounty to a favorite, but was taken in a very serious light by the forty thousand people thus unceremoniously transferred. The Assembly in its extravagance only took from them a great proportion of their profits; but the king was filching their capital, their lands, and their homes which they had inherited from their fathers, or laboriously acquired by their own strenuous exertion. The Legislature sent three deputies to England to remonstrate with the king against these intolerable grants, to endeavor to procure his assent to some charter which might secure them against such impositions for the future; and if they should fail in the first of these objects to endeavor to buy out the rights of the patentees. To bear the expense of these three deputies, Mr. Ludwell, Mr. Morryson, and Mr. Smith, the enormous annual tax of fifty pounds of tobacco was laid upon every tithable person for two years, which, though it was for a popular object, was considered as of itself an intolerable grievance, at which we cannot wonder when we reflect that many who had to pay this tax did not own a foot of land. The amount can only be accounted for by supposing much of it was to be used as secret service money, with such of his majesty's minions as could only see justice through a golden medium. These deputies exerted themselves with remarkable success, and procured from the king an order for a charter, precisely in conformity to the petition which they presented, and providing against the grieyances of which they complained, especially grants from the crown without information from the governor and council in Virginia that such grant would be of no injury; dependence immediately upon the crown of England and not on any subfeudatory; and exemption from taxation without consent of the Grand Assembly. His majesty ordered the solicitor general and attorney general to prepare a bill embodying these and the other matters embraced in their petition in due legal form for his signature; but the matter, notwithstanding the most assiduous attention of the deputies, was so long delayed in going through the official forms that it was finally stopped, before its completion, in the Hanaper office, by the news of Bacon's Rebellion.* * Hening, vol. II. p. 531. Soon after the deputies left Virginia, the difficulties of the colony had been increased by the addition of an Indian war, which although not now as formerly a matter causing danger of destruction to the whole colony, and requiring all its strength to repel it, was yet a subject of great terror and annoyance to the frontier. A standing army of five hundred men, one-fourth of which was to consist of cavalry, was raised by the Legislature, and every provision Mar. 7, 1675. made for their support and regulation;† † Hening, vol. II. 327. but after it was raised and in a complete state of preparation to march against the Indians, it was suddenly disbanded by the governor without any apparent cause.‡ ‡ Breviare and Conclusum in Burke v. II. p. 250. This was followed by earnest petitions to the governor from various quarters of the country, to grant a commission to some person to chastise the Indians, the petitioners offering to serve in the expedition at their own expense. This reasonable request was refused, and the people seeing their country left defenceless to the inroads of a savage foe, assembled of themselves in their primary capacity, in virtue of their right of self-defence, to march against the enemy. They chose for their leader Nathaniel Bacon, junior, a young gentleman of highly respectable family, and education, who although he had returned to Virginia but three years before, from the completion of his studies in England, had already received the honor of a colonel's rank in the militia and a seat in the Legislature for Henrico, in which county his estate lay,—exposed by its situation to the fury of the Indians. He stood high in the colony, and was possessed of courage, talent and address which fitted him well for such an enterprise. After Bacon had been selected by this volunteer army as their leader, his first step was to apply to the governor for a commission, in order if possible to have the sanction of the legitimate authorities for his conduct. The governor evaded this rational and respectful request, by saying that he could not decide upon so important a matter without his council, which he summoned to consult, at the same time artfully hinting to Bacon the injury which he might probably do himself by persevering in his course.§ § Ancient Records quoted by Burk, vol. II. p. 163. Bacon despatched messengers to James Town to receive the commission which he did not doubt would be ultimately granted; and as public impatience would not abide the dilatory proceedings of the governor, and he was probably nettled at the insinuations addressed to his selfishness, in the governor's communication,— he proceeded on his expedition, authorized only by the will of the people, the danger of the country, and the anxious wish of those who trusted their lives to his control. Sir William Berkeley, (whose conduct notwithstanding the high encomiums bestowed upon him, seems to have been marked in ordinary times only by a haughty condescension, which in his excellency was called suavity of manners, and in times of difficulty, by vacillating imbecility,) after temporising in the most conciliating manner with Bacon until his departure, now denounced him and his followers as mutineers and traitors for daring to defend their country after his excellency had refused them a commission; and gathering together such forces as he could collect consisting principally of the wealthy aristocrats in the settled country, who probably liked the mode of taxation which was least injurious to them, and who suffered little from Indian incursions upon the frontier, he marched to put down the rebellious troops. He had not proceeded further than the falls of James river, when he received intelligence of a rising in the neighborhood of James Town of a more formidable nature than Bacon's, which compelled him to retreat and take care of affairs at home. This new ebullition of feeling was headed by Ingram and Walklate, and was probably produced by the indignation of the common people at the absurd conduct of the governor in first refusing a commission to Bacon, and then marching to destroy him, whilst engaged in so useful an occupation; be this as it may, we find them insisting upon dismantling the forts which were intolerably oppressive, without producing any good effect against an enemy whose progress was by stealth, whose onset was sudden and furious, and whose retreat was immediate. Against such an enemy active operations in the field were required, and the vigorous prosecution of the war in his own country. The forts probably were regarded by the poor as instruments of power in the hands of the rich; which they kept up by oppressive acts whilst they took measures to put down Bacon's operations, which constituted the only hope which the people had for protection. The governor was obliged to yield to the storm. The forts were ordered to be dismantled, and the obnoxious Assembly was dissolved, and writs issued for a new election, in which for the first time freemen, as distinguished from freeholders, were elected. In the mean time Bacon had been very successful in defeating the Indians, destroying their towns, and taking them captive, and was returning leisurely to James Town when he heard of the revolution there. This induced him to leave his little army and with a few followers embark for James Town, but he was taken on his voyage by Gardiner who was cruising to intercept him; and sent a prisoner to the governor. Bacon had been elected a member for Henrico in the new Legislature, and was pardoned and permitted to take his seat upon his confessing the impropriety and disobedience of his conduct, praying pardon of the governor and promising future obedience. Credible report* * See Breviare and Conclusum in Burk, v. II. p. 251. says that he was induced to make this full and humiliating acknowledgment† † Hening, v. II. p. 543. upon a promise by the governor not only of pardon but of a commission; and indeed without supposing it the result of a compromise, it is difficult to account either for this act, or his subsequent conduct. The causes which induced his next step are not sufficiently explained by the historians of the times, but it was probably produced by the solicitations of his friends in the Legislature, who found that they could gain no redress of grievances. He collected troops in the country, and marched to James Town; he surrounded the state house with his enraged soldiers, demanding a commission for him, which by the earnest solicitation of the Council and Assembly was at length obtained from the governor, together with a full act of indemnity for his present conduct, and a letter highly applauding his designs and his proceedings addressed to the king and signed by the Burgesses, the Council and the governor. Thus relieved from all former sources of fear and provided against future contingencies Bacon again sallied forth towards the frontier. But the governor had not long been relieved from his presence before he dissolved the Assembly and retiring into Gloucester again declared Bacon a rebel and his army traitors, and raised the standard of opposition. Upon being informed of this Bacon immediately fell back by forced marches upon Gloucester, and compelled his puissant excellency to retreat with precipitation to Accomac. This county was at that time considered as a distinct territory although under the control of Virginia, and Bacon taking advantage of this against an unpopular governor, called a convention for the purpose of settling the government, declaring that the governor had abdicated. This convention met a Middle Plantation on the third of August, 1676, and declared that the government was vacant by the abdication of Sir William Berkeley, and that by invariable usage the council or the people might fill the vacancy until the king's pleasure should be known. Writs were then issued by five* * Burk, vol. II. p. 179, says—by Bacon and four other members of the Council, but the member of the Council was Nathaniel Bacon, sen., and the General was Nath'l Bacon, jun., delegate for Henrico.—Hening, vol. II. p. 544-5. members of the council for a new election of Burgesses. The convention next declared Sir William Berkeley guilty of aiding and abetting certain evil disposed persons in fomenting and stirring up the people to civil war; and that they would aid in discovering all such evil disposed persons and opposing their forces until the king be fully informed of the state of the case; and that they would aid Bacon and his army against the common enemy, and in suppressing the horrid outrages and murders daily committed by them. Bacon having now provided a regular government for the country proceeded once more against the Indians, who had formed a confederacy and gained several advantages since his retreat. He destroyed the Pamunkey, Chickahominy and Mattaponi towns and their corn, in retaliation of the late excesses. The Indians retreated before him, with occasional skirmishes until they reached their place of general rendezvous near the falls of James river. He there found their whole force posted on an eminence overhanging a stream which from the sanguinary nature of the conflict has been since called Bloody Run. They were protected by a stockade fort, which was stormed by the impetuous ardor of Bacon and his followers, who made great slaughter among them, encumbered as they were with their old men, women and children. In the mean time Berkeley had not met with that warm reception which he had anticipated amongst the loyalists of Accomac, but on the other hand he had been presented with a strong and spirited remonstrance against the objectionable acts of Parliament, and a requisition that they should be suspended at least so far as regarded that portion of the country. How the matter terminated we are not informed. The governor was not allowed to remain undisturbed in Accomac, until he could again succeed in raising a force which might give trouble. Bacon's party was in possession of all the vessels in the colony, and two of his friends, Giles Bland and William Carver, went with their force to cut off supplies from the governor, or as his friends surmised, to surprise him. But if such was their object they were defeated, for Capt. Larimore from whom one of the vessels had been taken, gave intimation to the governor's friends that he would betray his vessel into the hands of a party sufficiently strong to keep possession. The proposal was acceded to, and at midnight six and twenty men, obeying Larimore's signal, were along side of his ship and had possession almost before the crew were aroused from their slumbers; the other vessels were then easily taken. Thus Sir William finding himself in possession of the whole naval force of the colony whilst Bacon was absent in his expedition against the Indians, he collected together a force of some six hundred men, consisting mostly of aristocratic gentlemen and their servile dependants, and took possession once more of James Town. As usual his first act in returning to power was to disavow his acts in favor of Bacon as made under duress, and again to declare him a rebel, and his soldiers traitors. Bacon was on his return from his successful campaign when this news reached him; most of his followers had dispersed, but he hastened on with the remainder without regard to their fatigues in the recent campaign. He arrived before James Town late in the evening, fired his artillery and sounded a defiance, and then cooly dismounted and laid off his trenches. His men that very night by the aid of trees, earth and brush-wood formed a tolerable breast-work, and the next morning advanced to the pallsadoes of the town and fired upon the guard, without loss. Sir William Berkeley well knowing that time would increase the force of his adversary whilst it diminished his own, next resolved to try the effects of a sally, and some of his men at first behaved with some show of courage, but the whole body soon retreated in disorder before the well directed fire of Bacon's men, leaving their drum and their dead as trophies to the victors. Bacon would not allow the victory to be followed up, as it would have placed his men under the range of the guns of the shipping. To prevent the use which might be made of this auxiliary, he planted several great guns, so as to bear on the ships, which served also to alarm though they could not annoy the town. Now the marked difference which existed between the character of Bacon's troops and those of the governor was exhibited, and that too in a manner well calculated to exhibit the character of Bacon's proceedings. Berkeley's troops consisting principally of mercenary wretches, whom he had scraped together by the hopes of plunder, deserted every day when they found that the governor was determined to defend the place, and that they were likely to get more blows than booty in the contest, until at last the governor was left with little more than twenty gentlemen, whose sense of honor would not allow them to desert his person. Bacon's troops on the other hand were daily reinforced by accessions from the country people, who clearly considered him as an intrepid soldier who had delivered them from the butcheries of the savages, and a patriot who was now endeavoring to put down an odious and oppressive government. The governor finding his followers reduced to so small a number that it would be madness to attempt to defend the place, at length yielded to the earnest solicitations of those about him, and deceiving his adversaries as to his real design by exhibiting evidences of a contemplated attack, he went on board a ship at midnight and was seen next morning riding at anchor beyond the reach of the guns in the fort at James Town. Bacon with his followers, after their week's seige marched into the empty town the next morning, the governor and his party having carried off or destroyed every article of value. The possession of James Town in this situation was of no advantage to Bacon or his followers. The men who had left their homes to defend their country from the incursions of the Indians, could not remain together for the purpose of defending the capital from their hostile governor, who was quietly waiting in the river for them to depart, in order that he might again resume possession. What could be done with a town which could not be defended, and if defended was of no value to the possessors; but which was all-important to the enemy? The answer to this question was manifest, and Bacon's proposal for its destruction was received with acclamation; several of his followers, who owned the most valuable houses, applying the firebrand with their own hands to their own property. The sight of the flames started Sir William Berkeley on a cruize to Accomac; and Bacon having overcome all opposition to the government established by the convention, dismissed his troops to their homes. We have little account of Bacon's proceedings after this successful termination of his labors; we presume he did not do much as he was ill of a disease caught by sleeping exposed in the trenches before Jamestown, which in a short time terminated his existence. He died at the house of a Mr. Pate in Gloucester county. Thus died the distinguished individual, who overcame both the foreign and domestic enemies of his country, and left it enjoying the blessings of a free government. Had he lived precisely a century later he would have been one of the distinguished heroes of the revolution, and historians would have delighted as much in eulogizing his conduct as they have, under existing circumstances in blackening his character. He accomplished all which it was possible for him to do. He never opposed the British government but only foreign enemies, and domestic mal-administration, which he succeeded in defeating. He seems always to have acted by the consent and wish of the people, and never to have sought self-agrandizement. It was manifestly impossible for him to elevate himself to absolute power in Virginia without the consent of the government in England, and the people of Virginia; and the idea of resisting both of these powers was absurd. For all the evils which accrued to the country after his death, and the restoration of Sir William Berkeley, he has been unjustly made responsible, whilst he has received no credit for his good conduct, or the beneficial acts passed by the legislature during his ascendency. In short we can see no difference between his course, and that pursued in the previous expulsion of Sir John Harvey from the government, or the subsequent treatment of Lord Dunmore and many other royal governors at the commencement of the revolution. The only difference between the patriots of 1676 and 1776 was in the establishment of a free government, subject to the general controul of Great Britain, which was all that could be done in 1676, and the establishment of a free government independent of Great Britain, which was accomplished in 1776. The unfortunate death of Bacon, and the power of the mother country, destroyed in a great measure the benefit of the exertion of the little band of patriots of the first period, whilst the benefit of the latter have continued to exist. The loyal writers after the re-establishment of Berkeley, sought to hide his pusillanimity by extolling his virtues, and blackening his adversary, in which they have been blindly followed by other writers, who have attributed the subsequent misery to the previous rebellion instead of to the avarice, malignity and revenge of the governor and his party, seeking to overawe and suppress popular indignation, and break the strength of the popular party by the forcible exertion of arbitrary authority, as well as to avenge themselves for the indignities to which their own folly subjected them. On the other hand the patriots of the revolution have only received the just reward of their merit, in the lavish praises of a grateful posterity; and the loyal party of their day, has been justly handed down to universal execration.* * It will be seen that we have formed a more favorable opinion of Bacon and his coadjutors than has been generally expressed. This opinion was formed by a hasty perusal of all the documents to be found on the subject in Hening and Burke. We have followed in our account of his life the Breviare and Conclusum in Burke, which we believe is authentic; 1st. Because it was written by the king's commissioners, who would naturally be in favor of government, and were sent over at the special instance of Sir William Berkeley and upon his representations; 2nd. Because their account is impartial, and consistent with itself and with other evidence; 3rd. Because they took every means to inform themselves, and could not have been infected with the warm partizan feeling of either side; 4th. And lastly, because the "justification of Sir William Berkeley," which was manifestly written by a warm friend and partizan, whilst it denies the truth of the Breviare and Conclusum, with regard to Sir William's conduct subsequent to the rebellion, does not deny its truth with regard to the history of the rebellion itself. We see no act of aggression on the part of Bacon; the civil war is always commenced by the governor, whilst Bacon's attention is constantly diverted to hostilities with the Indians. We do not see Bacon arrogating power to himself but to the people. We find him after his first conduct acknowledging himself in error and asking pardon, and when we see him afterwards bringing citizens to Jamestown, it is not to put supreme power into his own hands or to overawe the legislature which was favorable to him, but it is to force the governor by the clamors of the people, to give him the commission which was so necessary to the preservation of the colonists from the incursions of the savages. When he obtains this commission we do not see him use it against his country but its enemies. But the governor first signs an indemnity, and even a letter to the king justifying and extolling the conduct of Bacon, and then when he is out of sight declares him a rebel and a traitor and prepares troops to oppose him, not in making war upon his country, but in actually fighting the Indians under his commission, and after his letter of praise. Under these circumstances, when the governor acted in a manner so friendly to the Indians and so hostile to the country, it was the duty of every honest man to resist his efforts, and to deprive him of his authority, to prevent his ruining the country which he ought to have protected. This Bacon did. But did he then seize the reins of government, and play the tyrant,—no, he defeated the Indians, and would have disbanded his army, had not the governor put down the government which the people established, and again set up his own authority, and declared Bacon's gallant little army traitors. Would it have been just to have then disbanded them to become the victims of his vengeance? Surely not. But it was his duty to drive out the hostile governor, and establish the power of the people, and then retire. We may obtain much light upon the subject of Bacon's character and conduct, by observing that an immense majority of the people were always on his side, and that he acted by their advice and authority as far as possible. The governor was only sustained by a few haughty aristocrats of his own stamp,—his warmest friends admit (Burke, vol. II. p. 185,) that when he went to Accomac he had not more than 20 men to stand by him; and that most of his followers in his return to Jamestown, were despicable wretches, who were only induced to take sides with him against their country by the promise of plunder, to be taken from the discomfitted rebels. (Breviare and Conclusum: Burke, vol. II. p. 252.) The death of Bacon, by leaving the republicans without a head, revived the courage of the governor so far, that he ventured in his ships to move about upon the bay and rivers and attack the inhabitants wherever he could find them defenceless, and snatch a little plunder to gratify his needy followers; always retiring when the opposite party appeared to oppose him. This predatory species of warfare, preventing the quiet pursuit of agricultural labors, and destroying all the comfort and happiness of society without producing any beneficial result, soon grew wearisome to both parties. Sir William Berkeley whose cruelties, especially to his prisoners* * See Sarah Drummond's petition,—Hening, vol. II. p. 558. had gone far to keep up the enthusiasm of popular excitement, finding that his name had ceased to strike that awe which habitual respect for one high in authority had formerly given it, and that his punishments excited indignation rather than terror, felt disposed to take advantage by milder means of the returning pacific disposition on the part of a people whose stubborn tempers could not be brought into obedience by force. With this view he treated his prisoners with more liberality, published an act of general indemnity, and proposed a treaty of peace to Ingram and Walklate, the principal leaders of the opposing party since the death of Bacon. So anxious were the people to be relieved from the present confusion and anarchy, and the governor once more to rule with uncurbed sway, that a treaty was speedily concluded, only stipulating on the part of the governor a general oblivion, and indemnity of past offences, and on the part of his opponents a surrender of their arms and a restoration of such property as they had taken. Thus easily did these unfortunate men deliver themselves again into the lions power, after having defeated him at all points, and inflicted deep and irremediable wounds upon his inflated vanity, and pompous mockdignity. The governor when he had his enemies in his power, instead of trying to heal the wounds of the bleeding state by mildness and conciliation, only added to its sufferings by a bloody retribution for all the trouble which he had been made to endure. Fines and confiscations for the benefit of his excellency became the order of the day, and an occasional execution as an extra treat to his vengeance. He at first attempted to wrest the honest juries of the county to his purpose, but in vain,—ten prisoners were acquitted in a single day. Finding that his enemies were thus likely to escape his grasp by the unflinching integrity, and sense of justice prevailing among the people, he determined to avoid the use of a court constituted upon principles of the English constitution, which he found so little subservient to his will; and tried his next victims under martial law. He here found a court of more congenial spirits. The commissioners of the king give an account of some of these trials, such as they were carried on even after their arrival, which mark well the spirit of the times. "We also observed some of the royal party, that sat on the bench with us at the trial, to be so forward in impeaching, accusing, reviling, the prisoners at bar, with that inveteracy, as if they had been the worst of witnesses, rather than justices of the commission; both accusing and condemning at the same time. This severe way of proceeding represented to the assembly, they voted an address to the governor, that he would desist from any further sanguinary punishments, for none could tell when or where it would terminate. So the governor was prevailed on to hold his hands, after hanging 23."† † Breviare and Conclusum in Burke, vol. II. p. 258. A notable way which the governor adopted to replenish his purse 77 after the disasters of the war, was to relieve the rebels from a trial in one of his courts martial, in which they were to be condemned, upon their paying him a great portion of their estates, by way of compromise. This method of disposing of men's estates without trial or conviction was protested against by his majesty's commissioners as a gross violation of the laws of England, but which Sir William's friends seem to think only a just retribution for the losses sustained by himself and the royal party during the rebellion.* * Justification of Berkeley, in Burke, vol. II. p. 263. Enormous fines payable in provision were also found a convenient method of providing for the king's troops which had been sent over to subdue the colony. His majesty's commissioners fortunately arrived in time to stay the wrath of the vindictive old man, who would as an eye witness says, "he verily believes, have hanged half the county if they had let him alone."† † Pressly, quoted in Burke, vol. II. p. 208. They urged him in vain to publish the king's proclamation of a general pardon and indemnity, and then proceeded to hold their commission for hearing and redressing grievances. As the proceedings of the governor diffused a gloom, the generality of which was co-extensive with the immense numbers that were engaged in the rebellion, so did the proceedings of the commissioners spread a universal joy. Crowds of persons now came forward to present their grievances; widows and orphans to ask for the confiscated estates of their husbands, and fathers who had been butchered by the military tribunals of the governor; others come in to complain of the seizing their estates without the form of a trial, and many who had submitted themselves upon the governor's proclamation of indemnity and pardon, conplained of subsequent imprisonment and confiscations of their property. The commissioners state in their report to the king and council,—that "in the whole course of their proceedings they had avoided receiving any complaints of public grievances; but by and under the hand of the most credible, loyal and sober persons of each county, with caution, that they did not do it in any mutinous manner, and without mixture of their old leaven, but in such sort as might become dutiful subjects and sober, rational men to present." When they found that all their representations to Sir William Berkeley, to endeavor to induce him to restore the confiscated estates, which were in the possession of himself or his most faithful friends, were in vain, they ascertained as many of the possessors as possible, and made them give security to take care of them, until his majesty should determine as to the restitution, which they recommended him to make. The commissioners also devised several matters of utility for the peace, good government and safety of the colony, which they recommended his majesty to adopt. Sir William Berkeley returned in the fleet to England, leaving Sir Herbert Jeffries, who had been sent over with the commissioners, as governor.— Upon his arrival he found that his cruel conduct in Virginia was looked upon with horror by most of his former friends, and the council, and was not sustained by the king, subservient loyalty to whom had been the source and spring of his high-handed measures. The old knight, thus finding himself execrated in Virginia, and despised in England, soon languished and died under the load of infamy, with which he had crushed the fair fame of his earlier years. Thus ended the life of Sir William Berkeley, a governor, whose early character historians have delighted to honor, and whose subsequent conduct they have sought to excuse; but of whom we can find nothing better upon record, than the negative merit of not opposing the legislature in its schemes of government, in the early part of his reign; but whose latter years are disgraced by cowardly imbecillity, and stained with crime. Before we take leave of the transaction which has been termed in complaisance to the royal governor, Bacon's Rebellion, it may not be amiss to cast a hurried glance at the laws passed by the Legislature which met under his influence; which must go far with posterity in determining whether the name of rebels or patriots would be most consistent with the character of their acts. They strike first at the most important and pressing subject, and the one which had been most neglected,—the Indian war. They provide efficient means for conducting it, and for regulating the army. The next act prescribed regulations for Indian trading, the abuse of which was thought to have been very mischievous. They next pray his majesty's governor and council that the lands which had been set apart at the last peace exclusively for the Indians, and which had been or might be subsequently deserted by them, might not be granted away to individuals, but might be used for the purpose of defraying the expenses of the war. The fourth act looks very little like an encouragement of rebellion, —reciting that tumults, riots and unlawful assemblies had recently been frequent, they make it the duty of every officer, civil and military in the country, to aid in suppressing them, and the duty of all citizens to assist such officers under penalty of punishment for refusal, and the governor is specially requested to assemble a force at the public charge with all possible expedition, to suppress such tumults, and inflict condign punishment upon the offenders; which says the act "will conduce to the great safety and peace of this country, and enable us the better to defend ourselves against the barbarous and common enemy." This single act sheds more light upon the history of the times and exhibits more plainly the history of the views of the principal actors than any or perhaps all other documents; we see in it the reason why no private persons took advantage of the unsettled state of affairs to disturb the public peace, and that there was no tumult or armed force except the regular army raised by the Assembly and put under Bacon's command, and no rebellious assembly except the miscreant crew raised by Berkeley in opposition to the government established by the people. Having thus provided for safety from foes without and for peace within, the Assembly next proceeded to the investigation of abuses by civil officers. Under this head they made several provisions for the prevention of abuses, which have been found so well devised that they have continued in use to the present day. They next provide against the long continuance of vestries in office; for the election of burgesses by freemen as well as freeholders; and against false returns of burgesses. Their eighth act provides against abuses committed by the justices in laying county levies, and requires that a number of discreet men chosen by the people, equal in number to the justices appointed by the governor, should act with the justices in laying the county levy. They next empowered the county courts to select their own collectors of county levies and dues; and prohibit any member of the council from sitting on the county court bench. Passing some acts of less general importance, but which were wise and useful, we come to an act of general pardon and indemnity for all crimes committed between the first of March and twenty-fifth of June, passed "out of a hearty and pious desire to put an end to all suits and controversies, that by occasion of the late fatal distractions have arisen," "and to bury all seeds of future discord and remembrance of anything whereby the citizens might be obnoxious to any pains or penalties whatsoever." Their last act deprives Edward Hill and John Stith forever of the right to hold any office of trust, judicature, or profit, because it was notoriously manifest that they had been the greatest instruments in raising, promoting, and stirring up the late differences and misunderstanding that had arisen between the honorable governor and his majesty's good and loyal subjects. The acts of this Assembly were signed by Berkeley in all due form, but were subsequently all declared void, though many of them were re-enacted by the Legislature, which under the influence and control of Berkeley, declared them void. Although the people of Virginia had laid down their arms they were not subdued, but continued to manifest through their Legislature the same undaunted tenacity of their rights which had ever characterised them. This was exhibited towards the king's commissioners in one of the boldest defences of privilege which the records of any nation can exhibit, and shows how strongly imbued with the spirit of freedom the people must have been when they could snuff the approach of tyranny at such a distance, and put themselves on their defence against their friends, lest their enemies might take advantage of their concessions. The king's commissioners were empowered to call for persons and papers, for the purpose of prosecuting more effectually their inquiries into the grievances of the colony. In conformity with their powers they called upon the secretary of the Legislature for its journals, but were surprised to find that although their proceedings were popular, and their object was to investigate and redress grievances of which these very men complained, that they refused to allow them to inspect their journals, returning for answer that it was a dangerous precedent which might be used in violation of their priviliges. At this time the governor and commissioners had complete physical power over the colony by the entire absence of anything like organized opposition, and from the presence of the king's troops; and availing themselves of this power they did not hesitate to wrest the journals of the Assembly from the hands of its officer by force. Upon which the Virginia Assembly published a bold and manly declaration, setting forth "that his majesty's commissioners having called for and forced from the clerk of the Assembly all the original journals of the Assembly, which power they supposed his majesty would not grant them, for that they find not the same to have been practised by any of the kings of England, and did therefore take the same to be a violation of their privileges, desiring withall satisfaction to be given them that they might be assured no such violation of their privileges should be offered for the future." The king was so much displeased with this declaration, that although he pardoned the members of the Legislature, he directed the record of it to be erased, and required the governor to propose a bill to the next General Assembly condemning the proceeding, and declaring the right of his majesty and his officers to call for all the public records and journals whenever they shall think it necessary for his royal service.* * Hening, vol. II. p. 561. Sir Herbert Jeffries deserves the merit due to an advantageous treaty with the Indians, and a successful opposition to the petty intrigues of the loyalists. He died in 1678, leaving the colony in the hands of the Lieutenant governor, Sir Henry Chickerly, during whose administration magazines and forts were established at the heads of the four great rivers to overawe the savages, and a silly act passed prohibiting the importation of tobacco from Carolina and Maryland for the purpose of transhipment, which practice if they had suffered it to continue might have proved very profitable to the colony, besides putting the tobacco trade more exclusively into its own hands. In the succeeding spring Sir Henry delivered the government to Lord Culpeper. The first act of his lordship was to declare full and unqualified indemnity to all for their conduct in Bacon's rebellion, and allowing reparation to those who should be reproached for their conduct upon that occasion. This popular act, added to the pleasing and conciliatory manners of his lordship, so won upon the good-natured simplicity of the Assembly, that they passed an act which probably no force could have extorted from them. They raised the duties and made them perpetual instead of annual as before, and what was at once surrendering up the great bulwark of that freedom for the safety of which they had been so long contending, they made the duties henceforth subject to his majesty's sole direction and disposal. The king rewarded Culpeper's address in obtaining this acquisition to his power, by the addition of a thousand pounds to his salary and one hundred and sixty pounds per annum for his rent. The Assembly too, as if they could not do enough for a royal governor who could condescend to smile upon them, granted his excellency a regular duty proportionate to the tonnage of every vessel trading to Virginia. Culpeper having thus obtained a considerable increase to his revenue by his trip to Virginia, proceeded to England to enjoy it, leaving the colony once more with Sir Henry Chicherly. The discontents of the people again began to extend to a degree which could scarcely be kept within bounds. The troops which had been sent over to suppress Bacon's Rebellion were still kept up. There were no barracks and the people positively refused to receive these idle and troublesome drones into their houses, although they were regularly billeted by the government. The low price of tobacco too was a never failing source of complaint, as well as the commercial regulations which aided in producing it. The colony had urged Culpeper to exert his influence at court to procure a cessation from planting, to which they had for some time in vain endeavored to obtain the assent of Carolina and Maryland. To these evils another was now added which struck another blow at commerce. The idea had been conceived that the colony could not prosper without towns, and to promote their growth the planters living principally on the shores of the magnificent Chesapeake and the broad navigable rivers of Virginia, were required to bring their produce to particular spots for the purpose of being shipped. Thus taxing the planter with unnecessary freight and commission for the benefit of such idlers as might congregate in the towns. These acts were enforced by heavy penalties, and as they contributed very much to the benefit of the town's people, the penalty for the violation was rigorously enforced. These prosecutions drove many traders from the country, and the poor planters to whom it was physically impossible to convey their crops to these paper-towns, were doomed to see their crops rotting on their hands by this injudicious legislation, or if they attempted to evade the law, have them wrested from them in the shape of penalties.* * Hening, vol. II. 561-2-3., and Burk, vol. II. p. 230. These several subjects of complaint induced the people of several counties to petition the deputy governor to call an assembly, to endeavor to provide a remedy for the evils. At the meeting of the Assembly, there was much debate and declamation upon the condition of the country, but no measure of relief was adopted. By order of the king however the two companies of infantry were paid off and disbanded, which put an end to one of the subjects of difficulty. The dissolution of the Assembly without effecting anything caused the impatience of the poor and ignorant people of several of the counties to break through all restraint, and expend their wrath in the destruction of tobacco plants, at a season of the year when it was too late to sow more seed. Sir Henry Chicherly with commendable moderation only took measures to stop these misguided people, without resorting to harsh punishments, but lest it should be drawn into a precedent, the Legislature not long afterwards made it treason.† † Hening, vol. III. p. 11. In the mean time Lord Culpeper arrived and his haughty bearing to the Council and the Burgesses soon gave intimation to them that his Lordship's feelings towards the colony had undergone a change. He enlarged, in his speech to the Assembly, much upon the favor of his majesty in disbanding the troops, and spoke of permission which he had obtained to raise the value of the current coin,—he then went on to declare that the colonists did not deserve these gracious favors, but rather punishment for their recent turbulence; he also expressed his majesty's great dissatisfaction at the refusal of the journals, and desired that that portion of their proceedings should be expunged. The Assembly expressed their gratitude for the concessions which had been made by the king, but at the same time with admirable good sense, and a knowledge of the principles of commerce which shows that they were not acting blindfold with regard to the alterations in the price of tobacco heretofore alluded to, protested by a large majority against raising the value of the coin; stating as a reason that the exercise of this dangerous power would be made a precedent, and specie which of course as the standard of other value should be as fixed as possible itself, would be blown about by the breath of the governor, and the people would have no certainty of the value of the coin in their pockets. They stated moreover that it was the duty of the Legislature to enact all laws for the regulation of commerce, and of course to prescribe the current price of specie, and they accordingly introduced a bill for that purpose; but this bill, which was necessary, as the coins of many different countries were in circulation, was stopped short in its progress by the governor, who declared that it was trespassing upon executive prerogative, and that he would veto any bill which the legislature might pass upon the subject. He then proceeded to fix the value himself by proclamation, raising the current price considerably, but making exception of his own salary and the revenue of the king. This exception was in effect nothing more or less than a new tax of the most odious and oppressive character, and the colony plainly recognised it as such, and refused to regard the exceptions, but paid the revenue as other debts according to the new standard. And the governor afraid to bring such a case before any court of law, which he well knew would expose his contemptible meanness, and yet afraid to allow his proclamation to be openly disregarded, which would have put an end at once to the authority of his edicts, was compelled by the dilemma to lower the value of the coin as suddenly as he had raised it. This was at once realizing all the worst anticipations of the legislature as to the arbitrary fluctuations in the standard of value, besides being highly unjust and oppressive to such persons as had made payment of debts according to the new standard, and such as had given credit during the time of the alteration. The governors had by some means been suffered to exercise the power of dissolving the Assemblies, and this having now grown into a usage was a favorite method of silencing their clamors, and they having rashly made the provision for the revenue perpetual and put the control of that subject into the king's hands, were bound hand and foot, and could not control executive usurpation by stopping the wheels of government. The governor now made use of this dangerous power and dissolved the Assembly. The governor thus left without a watch or control over his actions proceeded to a vigorous exercise of executive powers. The unfortunate plant-cutters who had merely been imprisoned, and such of them dismissed from time to time as would give assurance of penitence, and promise a peaceable demeanor, were now proceeded against with the utmost rigor for what the king was pleased to call their treasonable conduct. But the noblest victim for tyrannical persecution was Robert Beverly, the former clerk of the Assembly, who had refused to give up its papers without authority from "his masters, the house of Burgesses." For some reason it seems that an inspection of journals was demanded by the council again in 1682, and Beverley again refusing to deliver them was thrown into prison, in a king's ship, the Duke of York, then lying in the river, his persecutors being afraid to trust him to the keeping of the jails among his countrymen. Whilst he was in prison a committee of the council was appointed to seize the papers, which he foreseeing this event had secreted. The pretence for this imprisonment were the most frivolous that can well be imagined; he is accused of fomenting discord and stirring up the late partial insurrections, but the only specific act of which he was accused was setting on foot petitions for an Assembly.* * Hening, vol. III. p. 543. Under these arbitrary proceedings he was detained a prisoner, denied the writ of habeas corpus, and hurried about from prison to prison until the governor at last thought proper, after two years searching for charges, to commence a regular prosecution. The accusation consisted of three heads:— 1st. That he had broken open public letters, directed to the Secretary's office, with the writs enclosed for calling an Assembly, in April 1682, and took upon him the exercise of that part of the government, which belongs to the Secretary's office and was contrary to his;— 2nd. That he had made up the journal, and inserted his majesty's letter therein (which was first communicated to the house of Burgesses at their prorogation) after their prorogation;— 3d. That he had refused to deliver copies of the journal of the house of Burgesses in 1682, to the lieutenant governor and council, saying, "that he might not do it without leave of his masters." This was all which could be charged against this faithful officer, after so long an imprisonment, and so long a preparation for the prosecution. But of course they will not bear scrutiny, being only a flimsy veil thrown over their designs, rather indicating a wish to hide the naked deformity of the prosecution, than actually concealing it. Before this notable prosecution was ended Lord Culpeper forfeited his commission, and was superceded by Lord Howard, who took the oaths of office on the 28th of February 1684. His first measure was to call an assembly which as a popular act, induced the colony to hope some degree of mildness in his administration; but these hopes were soon dissipated. He pursued the unfortunate plant-cutters with renovated vigor, and such of them as had been excepted in a proclamation of general pardon, were now executed and their estates after paying officer's fees, appropriated to the governor's own use. The assembly met and refused to proceed with business for the want of a clerk, as their former clerk was in prison, and they refused to elect another. In this situation of affairs the matter seems to have been compromised, the governor no doubt despairing of his conviction upon the absurd charges made, and Beverley and his friends willing to end his long imprisonment and sufferings, by asking pardon, at the same time not giving up the papers or the principles for which he suffered. Be this as it may Beverley threw himself upon the mercy of the court, declining to employ counsel or make any defence, and was pardoned.* * Hening, v. III. p. 548-9. Ibid p. 550. Probably these long continued sufferings, with other persecutions afterwards endured, injured the constitution of Beverley, for we find that he died prior to April 1687. His noble conduct induced king James the then reigning monarch, to deprive the Burgesses of the election of their own clerk, ordering the governor to elect him, and requiring the assembly to make the clerk so elected, the usual allowance for his services. The accession of James II. was proclaimed with the usual demonstrations of respect in the colony, and complimentary assurances of Feb. 15, 1685. loyalty on the one side and gracious regard on the other were exchanged between his subjects and the assembly. But nothing was done to secure the freedom of the colony, and Lord Howard took advantage of the succeeding recess of the assembly, to enlarge the fees and perquisites of his office, and to impose new ones without the advice or authority of the assembly. This body which met in November, immediately took into consideration these arbitrary exactions, and passed spirited resolutions in reprobation of them, and made provision for the defence of the citizens from similar encroachments in future. To these acts the governor applied his negative, without assigning any reason. Lord Howard not satisfied with thus stopping the legislation of the colony, proceeded in effect to acts of executive legislation, by issuing a proclamation, in obedience he said to the king's instructions, repealing several acts of the legislature, which were themselves repeals of former acts, and declaring the acts repealed by that body to be revived, and in full force as before the passage of the repealing acts. This proclamation the assembly protested against as illegal and unwarrantable, as utterly subversive of the government, annihilating the right of the popular branch, and bringing all to bow in humble submission to the mercy of the prerogative. The spirited conduct of the Burgesses, could not be endured by the governor and he prorogued them. Oct. 20, 1686. The governor had sent to James an account of the conduct of this assembly. This representation produced in reply from James, a furious, quarrelsome order, calling their conduct mutinous, and attributing it to their "unquiet dispositions and sinister intentions to protract the time of their sitting to the great oppression of his subjects, from whom they received wages;" concluding by an order for the prosecution of their clerk Beverley, to whom he ascribes all of these evils. In the same year several persons were imprisoned and punished for treasonable expressions. The council was now as servile as the governor could wish, and he proceeded without interruption in his system of arbitrary innovation upon the established usuages of the colony, and the liberties of its citizens. The province of New York belonged to the king as proprietor as well as sovereign; and in order to strengthen this his own es- Nov. 10, 1687. tate, he sent orders for all the other colonies to assist in building forts, and supplying garrisons for its western frontier, alledging that these measures were equally necessary for the protection of all; in conformity to these orders a message was received from governor Dungan, requiring the quota of Virginia, but the legislature refused to appropriate a man or a farthing for purposes from which they were to derive no benefit but rather an injury, as the protection of the north-western frontier would drive the Indians further south, where they might commit their depredations upon the unprotected citizens with more impunity. Whilst the colony was contending against their governor, a revolution in England had dethroned the sovereign, and placed William and 1689. Mary upon the throne. This change whilst it placed the council which had made many loyal professions to James, in an awkward position, was an event producing analloyed joy to the people of Virginia, as they could now hope for justice to be done to their oppressive governor. Soon after this occurrence the war broke out between the allied powers and Lewis XIV, of France, and the colony was ordered to place itself in the best posture of defence. The complaints of the Virginia legislature against their governor at length were taken up by the privy council, and although the charges against. Howard were not tried, yet redress against his usurpation was granted, at the same time that the principles upon which they contended that their rights had been violated; were denied to be correct. Howard pleading ill-health was not deprived of his commission for not returning to the colony, but as it was necessary that there should be a governor upon the eve of a war, Sir Francis Nicholson was sent over. His conduct was mild and conciliatory, and consequently popular; among other highly beneficial acts passed under his government, was one for the establishment of a college which was very liberally endowed. He was succeeded by Sir Edmund Andros as governor-in-chief, who is represented to have been actuated in his administration by Sept. 20, 1692. a sound judgment and a liberal policy; to have been exact, diligent and methodical in the management of business; of a conciliatory deportment and great generosity.* * Burk, vol. II. p. 216. Sir Francis Nicholson was again made 78 governor-in-chief, in November 1698. He was an ambitious man, who had served in the capacity of a governor, and deputy governor in several of the colonies, and taken great pains to become popular, and to make himself well acquainted with the situation of all the colonies,—their wants,—their trade, and their capabilities, with a view to unite them if possible under one government, over which he hoped to obtain the appointment of governor general. The pressure of war with the combined force of the French and Indians, which seemed now about to fall upon the colonies, and rendered some union necessary for the purpose of defence, seemed highly favorable to his design. The French at an early day conceived a correct idea of the importance of the British colonies in America. The Count De Callier, governor of Montreal, during his residence in Canada, after a long experience derived from observations on the spot, had formed the bold project of separating in two the English colonies by the capture of New York. The success of this scheme would manifestly have destroyed that concert so necessary to harmony and efficiency of co-operation, and left the other colonies liable to be cut off in detail, and would effectually establish the safety of Canada by enabling the French to keep in check the powerful savage confederation, composed of the Five Nations which had lately by a furious irruption laid waste the country even to the gates of Montreal and Quebec. This plan of Callier's was adopted by the French government. A fleet was Sept. 1692. sent to the bay of New York, with orders to retain possession of it, until December, when if no further orders were received, it was to sail for Port Royal, land its munition and stores and return to France. The land force were to have marched from Quebec by the route of the Sorel river and Lake Champlain. This expedition was defeated by a destructive inroad of the Five Nations, which carried death and desolation over the whole country, even to the very gates of the capital. This unforeseen occurrence rendered it necessary to retain the whole force at home in measures of self-defence, and saved New York, without her having to strike a blow in her own behalf. The British government daily becoming more sensible of the importance of the North American colonies, and seeing the danger to which they were exposed by the plan of De Callier, set on foot a plan of general defence in the year 1695, adjusting the quotas of each colony to the ratio of its population, and forwarding the scale to the different governors, to recommend for the adoption of the respective colonial assemblies. Several of the colonies rejected this scheme, because several of those which were thought most exposed wished to employ it as their own interest dictated. Among the refractory was Virginia, which could not be prevailed upon by all the art and ingenuity of the governor, aided by his great enthusiasm in this his favorite plan,—to vote a cent to the enterprize,—to his inconceivable chagrin and mortification. Nicholson finding his own efforts utterly unavailing, laid the matter before the king, and urged the propriety of forcing Virginia to see her true interests upon this occasion. William in reply recommended a new consideration of the matter by the General Assembly, alledging upon the authority of Nicholson's report, "that New York was the barrier of Virginia against the Indians and the French of Canada; and as such it was but justice she should defend it." The assembly deemed it but due respect to his majesty to take the subject again into consideration, but found no reason to change then former opinion, declaring "that neither the forts then in being, nor any others that might be built in the province of New York, could in the least avail in the defence or security of Virginia; for that either the French or the northern Indians, might invade the colony, and not come within a hundred miles of such fort." The failure of this great subject irritated the governor beyond expression; and excited in his mind the most inordinate antipathy to the assembly. He charged the conduct of the assembly to a spirit of rebellion, and inveighed against what he called its parsimony in the most unmeasured terms, offering to pay the quota of Virginia out of his own pocket, and boasting afterwards that he had done it, but at the same time, taking the obligation of the gentleman to whom he gave the bills, that no use should be made of them until the Queen should remit money to pay them. This affectation of generosity was designed to gain popularity with the other colonies. The history of Virginia from this period to the breaking out of the war with France, presents a remarkable dearth of interesting or striking incident, all of which could be related would be a list of the governors, a detail of petty domestic affairs, a gradual extension and improvement of the colony, and a development of the designs of France; designs which were seen by some more penetrating spirits in the colonies, and measures recommended to defeat them, but which received no effectual check until the war broke out in 1754. We have now traced the progress of Virginia as far as it is possible to go with her affairs as an isolated province, cut off from all the world, and only struggling for existence at first with the savages, and afterwards for freedom with the mother country. She now becomes of importance in the political world, she emerges from obscurity and becomes a prize to be contended for by two of the richest and most powerful nations upon earth. She herself begins to feel her strength, and dares to wrestle with the civilized nations of the world. She becomes one of a confederacy of colonies for the purpose of resisting the attacks of a foreign enemy, and finally to resist successfully the power of the mother country itself, and then a leading member of a confederacy of independent nations. Our presumption and the necessity of the case have led us to attempt much more than will be forgiven, but cannot allure our feeble wing to essay a flight so daring as would be necessary to survey the broad field which now expands before us. We leave it rich, tempting and beautiful as it is, to be painted by some master whose skill will enable him to exhibit the grandeur and symmetry of the whole, and yet present upon the same canvass a detail of each separate beauty. For ourselves, we cannot be so barbarous as to disfigure so magnificent a subject by daubing it over with the same wretched colors, which we have laid on the preceding piece, in such extreme haste that we fear it will be difficult to distinguish the characters or design. For the rest our readers must be content with a very brief and general outline of the progress of affairs presented in the following:— Sketch of Virginia, history from the beginning of the French war to the beginning of the Revolution. After the accidental failure of De Callier's design upon New York, the French governors in possession of Canada and Louisiana, endeavored to strengthen themselves by uniting as far as possible their respective provinces. With this view, acting in concert they made no direct attacks, but continued to extend their forts and strengthen their power by alliances with the wild Indian tribes located between them; thus at once endeavoring to connect their possessions,—to monopolize the Indian trade; and to limit the British settlements. These designs of France produced a mission from the governor of Virginia to the commander of a fort, erected on the Ohio, in the year 1751. The commissioner sent was George Washington, then 19 years old. The answer of the commandant was evasive. The Virginians prepared for war and the French commenced an attack on the American trades and forts. An expedition was soon sent against the French, the command of which devolved upon. Washington after the death of Col. Fry. Washington at first gained a trivial success against a detachment under Monsieur Jumonville, who was killed, and was proceeding to the attack of fort Duquesne, the main object of his enterprize, when he learned that the French, considerably re-inforced were advancing; this induced him to retreat to Fort Necessity, a small stockade work which he had erected at the Great Meadows; in this work he sustained the incessant fire of the French for a day, when the French asked a parley and Washington surrendered the place upon highly honorable terms, being allowed to pass with his troops and baggage into the settled parts of Virginia. Great Britain began to see the necessity of aiding the colonies in their manly efforts to repel the enemy from their borders, and she sent an army under General Braddock, to protect the colonies and drive the French from the Ohio. Braddock met a convention of war from the several colonies at Annapolis on the 14th of April 1755, composed of the governors of New England, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia, at which convention concert of military operations was agreed upon. The legislature of Virginia made liberal appropriations. Washington accompanied the expedition as a volunteer aid to Braddock. The fate of this unfortunate expedition is too well known, Braddock valued too highly his own military skill, and the discipline of the British troops, he knew nothing of the character of his enemy, and so little did he esteem the provincials, (in his situation the best troops of his army,) that he left them all behind at fort Cumberland,—the Little and the Great Meadows,—and with General Dunbar,—except three companies of Virginians. Braddock advanced with too much confidence, and kept up in a savage wilderness all the "pomp and circumstance of war" which his military education had taught him were indispensable in Europe; he advanced unmolested until he had crossed the Monongahela, and arrived within a few miles of fort Duquesne, when he fell into an ambuscade of French and Indians; his troops were thrown into confusion, and after sustaining the murderous fire of an enemy concealed from their view for several hours, and having most of their officers killed, and their General mortally wounded, retreated in confusion; their rear was protected by the friendly Indians and few provincials left. The army fell back upon Col. Dunbar, who was next in command; and who marched off to Philadelphia, leaving two companies of provincials with the sick and wounded at Fort Cumberland. Braddock's defeat was of course followed by barbarous and distressing cruelties of the Indians to the frontier settlers; these were resisted by Washington as well as he was able with the small force under his command; but no regular expedition was undertaken against the enemy until the year 1758, when General Grant was disgracefully defeated before the walls of fort Duquesne, by the same rigid adherence to European tactics which had defeated Braddock. After the defeat of Grant the scattered and terrified troops were again collected, and the fort taken by Washington in the third year of the war, who repaired and garrisoned it, and named it Pittsburgh, in honor of the minister, who then presided over the councils of Great Britain. The treaty of Fontainbleau in November, 1762, between Great Britain, France, Spain and Portugal at length put a period to the war. Questions touching the power of the British Parliament to interfere with the concerns of the colonies had arisen more than once before the war, and during its continuance the delicate question arose of the proportions which the several colonies should pay for the common defence; the British ministry proposed that deputies should meet and determine the amount necessary, and draw on the British treasury which in turn should be reimbursed by an equal tax on all the colonies to be laid by Parliament: but the colonies were afraid to let the lion put his paw in their pockets even to to take back his own, and this being no time to raise difficulties the colonial legislatures were left to their own discretion in voting supplies, which they did with a liberality so disproportioned to their ability as to excite the praise and in some instances to induce a reimbursement on the part of the mother country. Virginia had always resisted any interference on the part of Parliament, especially in the navigation acts, and asserted as early as 1624 that she only had the undoubted right "to lay taxes and impositions, and none other," and afterwards refused to let any member of the council of governor Berkeley, in the height of his popularity, to assist them in determining the amount of the public levy. Again in 1676 even stronger language was used and acquiesced in by the king to whom it was immediately addressed. The slight taxes imposed for the regulation of commerce and the support of a post-office were borne by the colonies without a murmur, being considered only a fair compensation for a benefit received. In March, 1764, the ministers declared it "expedient to raise a revenue on stamps in America to be paid into the king's exchequer," the discussion of this was postponed until the next year in Parliament, but commenced immediately in America, and the proposition was met by every form of respectful petition and indignant remonstrance; which were however equally unavailing, and the stamp act passed in 1765. The passage of this act excited universal and indignant hostility throughout the colonies, which was displayed in the forms of mourning and the cessation of business; the courts refused to sanction the act by sitting, and the bar by using the stamps. In the succeeding Virginia legislature Patrick Henry introduced and carried among others the following resolution:— "Resolved, that the General Assembly of this colony, together with his majesty, or substitute, have in their representative capacity, the only exclusive right and power to lay taxes and impositions upon the inhabitants of this colony: and that every attempt to vest such power in any person or persons whatsoever, other than the General Assembly aforesaid, is illegal, unconstitutional and unjust, and has a manifest tendency to destroy British as well as American freedom." After the passage of Henry's resolutions the governor dissolved the Assembly, but the people re-elected the friends and excluded the opposer of the resolutions. The spirited conduct of Virginia fired the ardour of the other colonies, they passed similar resolutions, and a general congress was proposed. The deputies of nine states met in New York on the first of October; they drafted a Declaration of Rights, a petition to the King, the Commons, and the Lords. The stamp act was repealed, and Virginia sent an address of thanks to the king and Parliament. The joy of the colonies was short-lived. British ministers imagined that they could cheat the colonies out of their opposition to taxation without representation, by laying an import duty instead of a direct tax, and accordingly a duty was laid upon glass, tea, paper and painter's colors; but this was equally against the spirit of the British constitution, and met with a warmer and more indignant resistance on the part of the colonies, who now began to believe they had little to hope from the justice of Parliament. The Legislature of Virginia passed very spirited resolutions, which it ordered to be sent only to the king: upon the passage of which the governor dissolved it; and the members immediately met and entered unanimously into a non-importation agreement. The British ministers perceived their error and determined to pause in their violence, to effect this object the governors were directed to inform the colonies that his majesty's ministers did not intend to raise a revenue in America and the duties objected to should be speedily repealed. These assurances made to Virginia by Lord Botetourt, a governor whom they highly respected, served with his own good conduct for a time to allay her suspicions of the ministry, but the course they pursued towards Massachusetts was more than sufficient to re-kindle her jealousy. She passed a protest declaring that partial remedies could not heal the present disorders, and renewed their non-importation agreement. In 1771 Botetourt died, and Virginia erected a statue to his memory, which still stands in the town of Williamsburg. The delay of Lord Dunmore in New York for some months after his appointment to the gubernatorial chair of Virginia, excited the prejudices of the colony, which his sending a man of some military distinction as a clerk, and raising a salary and fees for him out of the colony, were by no means calculated to dissipate. The first legislature that met compelled the governor to dispense with the emoluments of his secretary Capt. Foy; and the next after thanking him his activity in apprehending some counterfeiters of the colony paper, strongly reprove him for dispensing with the usual forms and ceremonies with which the law has guarded the liberty of the citizen. The same legislature having provided for the soundness and security of the currency, the punishment of the guilty, and required the governor to respect the law; turned their eyes to their sister colonies, and appointed a committee of correspondence to inquire into the various violations of their constitutional rights by the British ministry. Whilst Virginia was employed in animating her sister states to resistance, her governor was employed in the ignoble occupation of fomenting jealousies and feuds between the province, which it should have been his duty to protect from such a calamity, and Pennsylvania, by raising difficult questions of boundary and exciting the inhabitants of the disputed territory to forswear allegiance to the latter province: hoping thus by affording a more immediately exciting question to draw off the attention of these two important provinces from the encroachments of Great Britain. This scheme as contemptible as it was iniquitous wholly failed, through the good sense and magnanimity of the Virginia council. Lord North full of his feeble and futile schemes of cheating the colonies out of their rights, took off the obnoxious duties with the exception of three pence per pound on tea, and with the ridiculous idea that he might fix the principle upon the colonies by a precedent, which should strip it of all that was odious, offered a draw-back equal to the import duty. This induced the importation of tea into Boston harbor, which being thrown overboard by some of the citizens, called down upon their city all the rigor of the celebrated Boston port bill. A draught of this bill reached the Virginia legislature whilst in session, an animated protest, and a dissolution of the Assembly by the governor of course followed. On the following day the members convened in the Raleigh tavern, and in an able and manly paper expressed to their constituents and their government those sentiments and opinions which they had not been allowed to express in a legislative form. This meeting recommended a cessation of trade with the East India company, a congress of deputies from all of the colonies, "declaring their opinion that an attack upon one of the colonies was an attack upon all British America," and a convention of the people of Virginia. The sentiments of the people accorded with those of their late delegates,—they elected members who met in convention at Williamsburg on the first of August 1774. This convention went into a detailed view of their rights and grievances, discussed measures of redress for the latter, and declared their determination never to relinquish the former; they appointed deputies to attend a general congress, and they instructed them how to proceed. The congress met in Philadelphia on the 4th September, 1774. Whilst Virginia was engaged in her efforts for the general good she was not without her peculiar troubles at home. The Indians had been for some time waging a horrid war upon the frontiers, when the indignation of the people at length compelled the reluctant governor to take up arms and march to suppress the very savages he was thought to have encouraged and excited to hostility by his intrigues. Lord Dunmore marched the army in two divisions, the one under Col. Andrew Lewis he sent to the junction of the Great Kanawha with the Ohio, whilst he himself marched to a higher point on the latter river, with the pretended purpose of destroying the Indian towns and joining Lewis at Point Pleasant; but it was believed with the real* * See Memoir of Indian wars, &amp;c. by the late Col. Stuart of Greenbrier, presented to the Virginia Historical and Philosophical Society by C. A. Stuart, of Augusta, for a strong corroboration of these suspicions. object of sending the whole Indian force to annihilate Lewis' detachment, and thereby weaken the power and break down the spirit of Virginia. If such was his object he was signally defeated through the gallantry of the detachment, which met and defeated the superior numbers of the enemy at Point Pleasant, after an exceeding hard fought day and the loss of nearly all its officers. The day after the victory an express arrived from Dunmore with orders for the detachment to join him at a distance of 80 miles, through an enemy's country, without any conceivable object but the destruction of the corps. As these orders were given without a knowledge of the victory, Col. Lewis was proceeding to the destruction of the Shawanese villages, when he was informed that the governor had made peace. The state of exasperation on the part of the colonies and the stubborn determination of the ministry made it manifest that there must soon be some overt act of hostility: this act was first committed in Virginia by its governor, who removed the gunpowder belonging to the colony from the magazine in Williamsburg to his Majesty's ship Magdalen, on the night of the 19th of April, 1775. This act threw the whole colony into a blaze, the people of Williamsburg demanded immediate restitution, and their demands were politely evaded. The citizens of Fredericksburg offered assistance to the town of Williamsburg, which was deemed in danger from the governor, and Patrick Henry marched at the head of a company of Hanover volunteers and forced the king's treasurer to make just compensation for the powder. The governor called a council which advised him to issue a proclamation calling the people to their duty, which he accordingly did, but with an effect so little beneficial to himself, that feeling no longer safe he sent for marines to protect him in his palace, and Captain Montague threatened to fire upon York if the detachment was interrupted. This threat excited in a still greater degree the animosity of the people, whose open and bitter denunciations so alarmed the governor as to make him again have recourse to his council, which advised recourse to an assembly to appease and alleviate the excited wrath of the citizens. The meeting of this assembly at once proclaimed that all confidence between the governor and people was gone, many met in arms, they feared the solemn sanctity of their character would not be respected, and they depended for protection upon their individual prowess. It was a humiliating and exciting spectacle for the people. The governor was alarmed and fled by night to a British ship, and refused upon invitation of the Assembly to return to his palace, or to sign bills presented to him, of the utmost importance to the colony, and refused to perform this branch of his duty unless the assembly would come and hold their meetings under the guns of his ship. In this emergency the governor was declared to have abdicated, and the president of the council appointed to act in his place, and as it appeared that on his retreat he had liberated the Indian hostages without having ratified the treaty, commissioners were appointed to ratify in behalf of the colony. His Lordship after the termination of intercourse between himself and the Assembly, sailed down the river, attempting to enlist citizens against their country, and slaves against their masters. He never again resumed his power. From that moment to the present day the people of Virginia have governed themselves.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">"I have recently returned from a geological excursion in Virginia. I entered the state near the head waters of the Potomac, passed thence to Winchester, followed the course of that fine Valley to the Natural Bridge; retracting my steps, I turned westwardly at Staunton, crossed the mountain at Jennings' Gap, and visited the justly celebrated medicinal springs in that region, returning, I went from Staunton through Charlottesville to Richmond, and down the James to its mouth. When this tour is taken in connection with a former visit to Wheeling, it will be conceded that I have seen enough of the state to enable me to form a rough estimate of its geological and mineralogical importance and I do assure you sir, that although my anticipations were far from being meagre, I was astonished at the vastness and variety of interesting objects in that department of natural history, that were constantly developing themselves, inviting the mind of man to reflection, and his hand to industry, and displaying at every step the wisdom and benificence of the Great Creater. I determined upon respectfully suggesting to your excellency, the expediency of a topographical, geological, mineralogical, and orgetological survey of Virginia. Should the enlightened representatives of the freemen of your state concur in this opinion, it will redound to the honor of all concerned, by the encouragement it will give to the study of the natural sciences—by the enhancement in the value of land in the interior, thereby enriching the state and its citizens, and giving a very proper check to unnatural migrations to the extreme west—by bringing to light and usefulness innumerable valuable crude materials,—thereby not only enlarging the field of manufactures and the useful arts, but furnishing carrying for the canals and roads already constructed, and assisting in new internal improvements in locations of equal importance. That I may not appear to be too enthusiastic, pardon me for pointing out some of the most obvious features in the geology of Virginia. Whether we consider the comfort and convenience of our species, or the industry and prosperity of a state, there is no mineral production that can outvie in importance with that of coal. In this country, where we have hitherto always had a superabundance of fuel, owing to the vast extent of our natural forests, the importance of a constant and abundant supply is not felt, and we are too apt to neglect properly to appreciate its value; but it is not so elsewhere—and a moment's reflection will shew that it ought not to be so here. Without fuel, of what use would be to us the metallic ores? For instance iron, which is now moulted, drawn and worked into thousands and tens of thousands of useful instruments, from a knife, to the complicated machinery of a steam ingine, would forever remain an indissoluble and useless mass of matter without the aid of fuel. Even the steam engine itself, that colossus of modern machinery, without the assistance of fire would be inactive and impotent. Where is the state in this Union? I might perhaps safely ask, where is the country in the world, that can surpass Virginia in the variety of position and abundance of supply of this valuable combustible? She possesses, not only in common with her sister states, a liberal quantity of bituminous coal in her western and carbonaceous regions—where, according to geological calculations, bituminous coal might be reasonably expected to be found, but in the eastern division of the state, within a few miles of the tidewater of a majestic stream which empties its ample waters into the Atlantic Ocean—in a geological position where bituminous coal never would have been sought after, because bituminous coal could not there have ever been expected to have been found, bituminous coal of a good quality, and apparently in great abundance has been found,—nature seeming, as it were, in this instance, to enable her to favor an otherwise highly favored land—to have defined all her own rules, and baffled the skill of the gravest geologist, by depositing bituminous coal upon the naked and barren bosom of the uncarbonaceous granite! I have often wondered why this anomaly did not strike the capacious and highly gifted mind of Jefferson; and why he, or some other of the many reflecting men of Virginia, was not led by it to inquire, what else there might be in store for the good people of that state? By neglecting to seek for them, we ungratfully reject the proffered kindness of our Creater; the laws of inanimate matter are, in this respect, in unision with those that govern animated nature we are furnished with the material and means, but in order to stimulate us to useful and healthful industry, we must labor in their appropriation. God gives us the earth and the seed, but we must plough and sow, or we can never reap; so he has bountifully placed within our reach innumerable valuable rocks, minerals and combustibles; but to enjoy them, we must delve into the bowels of the earth—and having found them, we must by various laborious processes render them fit for our use. To those who are accustomed to regard these things, it is difficult to determine which causes the most painful sensations, to observe how few coal mines, in comparison to what might be, are opened in the neighborhood of Richmond; or the want of skill exhibited in the selection and working of those recently opened. Nor is the deposite of the bituminous coal upon the granite, the only geological anomaly of this quarter. Proceeding from Charlottesville towards Richmond, almost immediately after you leave the talcose formation of the Blue Ridge, you are astonished at the fertility of the soil. You can scarcely persuade yourself that you are travelling over a country of primitive rocks. Soon however you discover that the fertility is not universal, but confined to patches of a brick red covering, that overlay the disintegrated materials of the primordail formations, and upon seeking further into this curious matter, your surprise is not a little increased upon discovering that this brick-red covering owes its existence to the disintegration of a rock which, in most other places, is exceedingly slow to decompose—and which, when decomposed, forms a cold and inhospitable soil. It is the hornblende sienite. Here it is surcharged with iron, which oxidating by exposure to the atmosphere and moisture, the rock freely disintegrates, and the oxide of iron being set at liberty, imparts its coloring to the ground, and fertilizes the soil in an extraordinary degree. Next in geological and statistical importance, I would place the mineral springs of Virginia, and those would form a legitimate subject of investigation to those who should be appointed to conduct a geological survey. I am not aware of any portion of country of the same extent, possessing an equal number and variety of mineral springs as the counties of Bath, Greenbrier and Monroe. This is a subject upon which one might easily compose a book, but I must confine myself to a few lines. The waters are thermal and cold; the former of various degrees of intensity. They hold in solution a variety of metals, earths, acids, and alkalies, combined in various proportions, and suited to relieve the sufferings of invalids from a number of diseases. Mineral springs of less interest than these have excited the attention of the learned in almost every age and country; and Virginia owes it to her high mental standing, independently of every other consideration, to assist the cause of science by investigating the causes of the high temperature, and making accurate analysis of these valuable waters. It is the duty of states, as it is of individuals, to furnish their quota to the general stock of information; and this is peculiarly the duty of a republican state, whose happiness, nay, whose very political existence depends upon an improved state of the minds of its citizens. Mr. John Mason Good, in his "Book of Nature," after describing the barren state of society in the middle ages, says. "We have thus rapidly travelled over a wide and dreary desert, that like the sandy wastes of Africa, has seldom been found refreshed by spots of verdure; and what is the moral? That ignorance is ever associated with wretchedness and vice, and knowledge with happiness and virtue. Their connections are indissoluble, they are woven in the very texture of things, and constitute the only substantial difference between man and man," and I would add between state and state. Has the heat of these waters any connexion with volcanic phenomena? or is the temperature entirely chemical, originating in the decomposition of sulphuret of iron, as I suggested some years ago, in a paper published upon the subject? At the Hot Springs, the hot sulphur water and the cold pure water issue out of the calcareous rock at the base of the Warm Spring mountain, within a few feet of each other. One of these Virginia springs makes a copious deposite of calcareous tufa, and at another, you perceive newly formed chrystals of sulphate of iron. The White Sulphur Spring takes its name from a rich white deposite, and the Red Sulphur from one of that color. If this is not an uncommon and a highly interesting section of country, calling aloud for investigation, and meriting legislative inteference, then have I taken an entirely erroneous view of the subject. The Warm Spring mountain is white sandstone. The rocks of the Valley of the Hot Springs are calcareous, argillaceous and siliceous. They are all nearly vertical. At first the two former, and afterwards the two latter alternate. They have all been deposited in a horizontal position, and between their narrow strata are thin layers of clay, covering organic remains * * * * * * The mountain ranges of Virginia are more numerous, and the Valleys consequently narrower than they are in Pennsylvania, but some of them are very interesting. The great Valley, as it is sometimes called, or par excellence, the Valley, situate between the Blue Ridge and the North and Alleghany mountain, is by far the most extensive. The rocks often obtrude, rendering the soil rather scanty—but nevertheless this is a fine district of country. I could find no fossils in this rock. In regard to the metallic ores I would observe, that I discovered sufficient indications of their existing in Virginia in quantity sufficient to justify a more accurate examination. Iron abounds in almost every part of the western section of the state, traces of copper, lead, manganese and chrome, have also been discovered near the Blue Rridge, and the gold of Orange county is equal to any found in the Carolinas or Georgia. I have never seen any thing that exceeds the richness and variety of coloring of the serpentine of the Blue Ridge. This mineral is easily cut, and the fineness and closeness of the grain render it susceptible of a high polish at Zoblitz, in Saxony, several hundred persons are employed in its manufacture. Besides the minerals belonging to the talcose formation, and generally accompanying serpentine, are many of them valuable in the arts; for instance, steatite (soap stone,) talc, chromate of iron, clorite of slate, and native magnesia. A geological survey would most probably lead to the discovery of most of these minerals. I could make large additions to this communication, but for the fear of traspassing upon your patience. I will therefore close my observations with noticing two instances of a want of confidence in the mineral productions of your own state, which I am persuaded that a geological survey would tend to correct. I met many wagons loaded with sulphate of lime (gypsum) from Nova Scotia, being taken to the interior to be used as a manure, but I did not see one wagon employed to bring carbonate of lime (common lime stone) from the inexhaustible quarries of the great Valley to any other district to be used for the same purpose. In the beautiful and flourishing city of Richmond, I observed the fronts of two stores fitting up in the new and fashionable style with granite (so called) (sienite) from Massachusetts, while there exists in the James river and on its banks, in the immediate vicinity of the town, rocks of a superior quality, in quantities amply sufficient to build a dozen cities. I have the honor to be, sir, your most obedient servent, PETER A. BROWNE.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">Washington, Feb. 8, 1834. Dear Sir,— In answer to your letter of the 29th ult I have much pleasure in stating, that I was highly gratified by my excursion to the Red Sulphur Springs last season. It was my first visit to that place, and I was so much pleased with the water, the entertainment and the scenery, that my stay was protracted, with enjoyment, for nearly three weeks. I send you a pamphlet just published in this city, on the virtues of these waters, by which you will see that they are rising into deserved celebrity. The author Doctor Huntt is a distinguished physician here whose opinions are entitled to the utmost respect and confidence, and I hope he will be instrumental in extending the knowledge of these valuable waters. With every wish for your success, I remained dear sir, very respectfully and truly, yours, WM. WIRT.</field>
