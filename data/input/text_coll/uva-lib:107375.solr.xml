The University of Virginia Summer School is conducted primarily for teachers and students in high schools, academies and colleges. It takes as its peculiar province, not the ordinary summer institute, nor the more popular and inspirational summer school, but the solid and substantial training of high school teachers, college teachers, college students, and teachers who either have professional and life certificates or wish to procure them. Because the courses of instruction in high schools are not clearly defined but merge into the grammar grades below and into the lower college classes above, the high school offers itself as a strategic center around which to build up instruction, the emphasis of which is upon subject matter. The justification of such a summer school for high school teachers is the unusual activity in the South just now in behalf of secondary education. The large number of high school and college teachers attending the Summer School last year is an additional proof of the need of such a school. LOCATION.âCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. One mile from the University is an excellent iron spring connected with the Jefferson Park Hotel, a much frequented resort. LABORATORIES AND MUSEUMS.âThe equipment possessed by the University for the work of instruction, alike in Academic and in the Professional departments, has been much augmented in recent years, and is now excellent in quality, as well as extensive. In scientific studies large facilities are offered by the Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Chemical Laboratory and the Museum of Industrial Chemistry, the Lewis Brooks Museum, the Biological Laboratory. LIBRARY.âIn addition to the departmental libraries the general university library is common to all departments. Originally selected and arranged by Mr. Jefferson, it has since been much enlarged by purchases and donations, and contains at present upwards of fifty thousand volumes. Students are allowed the use of the books under the usual restrictions, and the Librarian is present in the Library for eight hours daily to attend to their wants. REST AND STUDY ROOMS.âMadison Hall, the beautiful new building of the Young Men's Christian Association, which was recently erected at the cost of seventy-five thousand dollars, will be open to students of the Summer School from nine o'clock in the morning until ten at night. Students will have access to the current periodicals in the reading room during the day and until ten at night. The other rooms will be used for rest, for study, for recreation, and for social gatherings. North of the building there are nineteen tennis courts which will be equipped for the use of the students. DAILY GENERAL ASSEMBLY.âDaily from 11:30 to 12:15 there will be a period, in which the students may have the privilege of attending a gathering of the entire body. At this time there will be short addresses on some interesting topic, and a brief prayer and song service, under the leadership of some clergyman or member of the Faculty. Generally the singing will be choral, under the direction of the instructor of music, but occasionally, as opportunity offers, prominent soloists will be procured. SUNDAY VESPER SERVICES.âExperience has shown that no Sunday Chapel service held here during the summer has been more attractive or more appreciated than what has sometimes been called the Sunset Service. Further advantage of holding this service at this hour is, that it enables all the Faculty and the students of the summer school to unite in one common service without at all interfering with their attending the churches of their choice in the city. This service, which will always be kept within one hour, will begin at six-thirty. It will consist of congregational singing and a brief address by some prominent minister or layman. The pipe organ used in this service is the work of one of the best organ makers in the country, and is admirably adapted, both in size and tone, for church purposes. RECREATION.âProvision has been made to keep the Fayerweather Gymnasium open during the summer, under the control of a competent gymnasium director, who will give daily systematic instruction in physical culture. No fee will be charged for these courses nor for the use of the gymnasium, and it is hoped that every student will come prepared to take advantage of the physical training courses. A portion of each day set apart to systematic physical development will be profitably spent. The swimming pool and baths will be at the service of the students. The tennis courts belonging to Madison Hall will also be kept in readiness, duly marked and with nets in place. The splendid athletic field, one of the finest in the South, with base-ball grounds and quarter mile running track, will be at the disposal of those who wish to engage in the manly sports. Within three minutes walk from the Academic Building, the woods may be reached. These woods and the neighboring mountains furnish ample opportunity for pleasant strolls or for longer tramps on the part of those more vigorous. One of these walks leads to Fry's Spring, a most efficacious chalybeate spring, which may also be reached by street car. EXCURSIONS.âUnder the directorship of Professor Maphis, there will be excursions to neighboring points of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Cavern; the battle fields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond (three hours ride to each) should make a visit to either exceptionally interesting. Saturdays will be reserved for these excursions. ORGAN RECITALS AND ENTERTAINMENTS.âElsewhere in this announcement mention has been made of the pipe organ in Cabell Hall. It is not out of place here to say that this organ, which has recently been installed, is one of the best products of one of the largest organ manufacturers in America. It is an antiphonal organ with fifteen hundred pipes, and exhibits all of the possibilities of organ manufacture. To bring out all these possibilities requires a master organist, and it is the purpose of the management of the Summer School to procure distinguished organists for the recitals. Professor Paul de Launay, whose reputation is well established in this country, has already been secured to give seven performances. Other evening entertainments will be announced during the session of the Summer School. RURAL LIFE WEEK.âThe time between July 13th and July 16th will be devoted especially to the problems of rural life in general, and rural school problems in particular. Among the speakers will be Hon. J. D. Eggleston, Jr., State Superintendent of Public Instruction; Dr. S. A. Knapp and Dr. Dick Crosby of the U. S. Department of Agriculture; Dr. C. W. Stiles, government expert on home supervision; Mr. T. O. Sandy, who has done so much for co-operative farming in Virginia; Dr. K. C. Davis, Dean of the New York College of Agriculture; Dr. Ennion G. Williams. virginia Commissioner of Health, who will speak on "The Preventable Diseases in Rural Virginia, the reasons for them and the methods to lessen them;" Dr. Fletcher of the Virginia Experiment Station; Miss Edith Charlton of the Iowa Agricultural College, who will discuss the life and work of women in rural communities; and several members of the U. S. Forestry Service. The discussions will center around the large topics of better educational facilities for rural communities; better means of communication, improved methods of co-operation; the improvement of sanitary conditions. There has been connected with the Summer School no more helpful, interesting and vital enterprise than rural life week. This work should be especially interesting to county superintendents, progressive farmers, members of county school boards, rural school teachers, and officers of the citizens' improvement leagues. It will be entirely free to the public. THE HIGH SCHOOL CONFERENCE.âOn Tuesday and Wednesday, the 22nd and 23d of June, the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools of Virginia will hold its summer conference in the University buildings. At this meeting leading topics of interest to high school instructors will be thoroughly discussed. All high school and college teachers are invited to this Conference. SUNDAY-SCHOOL CONVENTION.âThe eighteenth annual convention of the Virginia State Sunday-School Association will be held in Cabell Hall Auditorium Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, June 29th, 30th, and July 1st and 2nd. The work of the Convention covers the whole field of Sunday-School endeavor, and inasmuch as most teachers do this kind of work also, it is believed that they will be pleased to attend the meetings of this Association during leisure moments. A chorus of over two hundred voices under the direction of a professional leader will be one of the interesting features of the Convention. Another will be the immense exhibit of maps, books, pamphlets and other supplies in the hallway of Cabell Hall. Entertainment of the visiting delegates has been provided in Charlottesville. Those wishing programs, announcements, and any further information should address C. W. Baines, Newport News, Virginia. COURSES IN PREVENTIVE MEDICINE.âA brief course in Preventive Medicine is to be launched at the University this summer, for the preparation of public health officers. The course is as condensed as possible, and is really an introduction to the specialty of Public Hygiene. CREDIT.âCertificates will be granted in each course in the University Department (courses outlined from page 18 to page 39, including Psychology) to those students who attain a grade of 75%. This grade will be the average of the recitation and examination marks. No student will be allowed to take more than three courses without the permission of the Director. This regulation does not apply to the School of Methods. As a rule, students wishing University credit should not attempt more than two courses in one summer: they must receive in all cases permission to take more than three. In registering, students should state what credits they desire, as arrangements for credit must be made before taking the course. After each course in this catalogue is stated its credit value in case University credit is allowed for it. Any course outlined from page 18 to page 39, including Psychology, may be counted toward the Virginia Teachers' Professional Certificate. No credit is allowed either toward this certificate or toward University courses, for work done in the School of Methods, except in certain special courses where permission has been granted by the Director and the Registrar; in all such cases additional work is assigned and an additional fee is charged. 1. Professional Certificate.âThe following regulations with reference to credits towards the Professional Teaching Certificate in Virginia have been passed by the Board of Examiners: "Resolved, That those teachers holding first grade or high school certificates, who attend the Summer School of the University of Virginia for two sessions of six weeks each, and who make an average of 75% on class work and examinations, in six courses, other than elementary school subjects, shall be entitled to the Professional Certificate which shall continue in vogue for seven years, subject to renewals from time to time." These six courses would necessitate the work of at least two sessions and must include at least four different subjects. The term courses as used in this paragraph refers with few exceptions to those courses outlined under the various subjects in this catalogue from page 18 to page 39. No course may be counted toward a professional certificate without the sanction of the Director or Registrar. No course may be counted toward the professional certificate unless the student has previously registered for that course and paid the fee of five dollars due for such course, receiving a card of admission signed by the Registrar and by the Bursar. 2. Credit Allowed by Other States than Virginia.âApplication has been made to other Southern States for credit equal to that accorded by the Virginia Board of Examiners. Credits are now allowed toward the extension of the certificates by certain other States. In others the University Summer School instructors are appointed to hold State examinations. In some other States arrangements may be made upon application of the teachers from those States. All persons wishing to arrange for credits with their respective school authorities should correspond with the Director of the Summer School. 3. University of Virginia Credit.âBelow are stated the conditions upon which credit in the University of Virginia may be granted for work done in the Summer School. (a) The student must satisfy the entrance examination requirements of the University of Virginia and matriculate before he can receive credit in the College for any work done in the University of Virginia Summer School. (b) The Dean of the College will accept the completion of the courses in the Summer School in lieu of the entrance examinations in the same subject, provided that in his judgment the courses are equivalent to those required for entrance to the University of Virginia, and provided, that the certificates of courses completed be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned. (c) The Dean of the College and the professor in charge of the school in which credit is desired will accept certificates of completion of summer courses in lieu of "A" courses in the University of Virginia, provided that such summer courses be approved by the University of Virginia professor concerned as the full equivalent in character and scope of the corresponding "A" courses in the University. (d) Certificates of completion of certain summer courses approved by the Academic Faculty will be accepted in lieu of portions of "B" courses, provided that in each case the Dean of the College, the Faculty Committee on Degrees, and the professor in charge of the courses for which credit is desired certify in writing that the summer courses completed are equivalent in character and scope to that portion of the regular sessional work for which credit is desired. (e) The character of the examinations and the numerical standard (75%) required for their successful completion shall be the same as those of the sessional examinations. TEACHERS' POSITIONS.âThe University Appointment Committee receives demands for teachers each year. This Committee would be glad to have well qualified teachers who are in attendance upon the Summer School leave their applications with the Director, who is a member of the Committee. REGISTRATION.âFriday, June 18th, will be devoted to the registration of students. All students should register on this day: The Registrar's office will be in the South East rooms of the Rotunda. The entire faculty of the Summer School will be in the adjoining room from 8:30 to 1:30 for counsel, on June 18th. Students should consult freely with members of the Faculty in case of difficulty in choosing courses. No certificate will be granted to students who fail to register before Friday, June 25th, except a certificate of attendance. The form of registration will be as follows: Each student upon application will receive from the Registrar, Professor Maphis, a card with space for name, and address, and for courses to be taken. This card should be filled out by the student, giving in full the catalogue number and title of each course desired. This card should be presented to the Registrar for purposes of filing. In exchange for it the student will receive a card for each course desired, each one signed by the Registrar. These cards should then be presented to the Bursar, Mr. Moran, together with the fee for each course. Mr. Moran will sign and return each of them to the student, who should present it to the professor of the course prescribed by the card. No student will be admitted to any course without the card of registration for that class, properly signed by the Registrar and the Bursar. A single registration card will admit to all the courses in the School of Methods. In the University School not more than three courses may be taken in any one summer, except by special permission of the Director. In this department each course requires a separate registration card. FEES.âNo registration fee will be charged. The tuition fee will consist of $5.00 for each course taken, except in the School of Methods, where a fee of $5.00 admits the applicant to all courses. The Department of Public Instruction of Virginia has provided by donation that Virginia teachers shall be charged only $3.00 for the School of Methods. Further exception is made to the $5.00 fee in certain other courses where a special fee has been mentioned in connection with the outline in this catalogue. Before being enrolled in a class each student is required to register and to pay all fees. No reduction of fee will be allowed for late entrance or withdrawal. TIME AND PLACE OF RECITATIONS AND LECTURES.â On Friday, June 18th, at 8 p. m. the Summer School will assemble in Cabell Hall to hear the address of welcome by Dr. Alderman, President of the University of Virginia. Recitations will begin in all courses Saturday, June 19th, at 8:30 a. m. Students should present themselves at the first meeting of their classes with the required textbooks and be prepared with tablets to take notes on introductory lectures. There will be no classes on Saturday unless arranged for by individual instructors, except on Saturday, June 19th, and Saturday, June 26th, when classes will meet at the usual hour. The length of recitation will be one hour, ten minutes of which may be allowed for transfer from one class room to another. Thursday, Friday and Saturday, July 29th, 30th, and 31st, will be used for examinations; the determination being to provide for six full weeks of recitation over and above registration and examination days. Following the outline of each course in this announcement will be found the time and place of meeting for each class. Individual professors, may, upon consultation with the Director change the hours scheduled, in order to avoid conflicts. The Summer School lecture rooms are for the most part restricted to four buildingsâ Cabell Hall, the Rouss Physical Laboratory, the Engineering Building, and the Rotunda. REDUCED RAILWAY RATES.âAll students coming to the Summer School from points south and west of Virginia should apply several weeks in advance to their local agents for reduced rates. In case the agent has received no instructions for selling reduced rate tickets to Charlottesville, Virginia, the Director of the Summer School should be written promptly for information. Reduced rate tickets can be bought only on one of the following datesâJune 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 28th, July 5th and July 12th. In order that the tickets may be good for return on any date before Sept. 30th they must be deposited with Anderson Bros., Agents of the Southern Railway, at the University of Virginia, within two days after the arrival of the holder of the tickets and a fee of fifty cents paid for having them extended to the desired date for returning. It is expected that all railways south of the Potomac and east of the Mississippi rivers will co-operate in these reduced rates. All persons intending to start from points along other railways than the Southern or Chesapeake and Ohio should write to the Director for information several weeks in advance. Return trip tickets at reduced rates will not be sold within Virginia, unless the unusually low rate of two cents per mile now provided for by law over all Virginia Railways is discontinued. Local agents can usually give information upon this point. BOARD AND ROOMS.âBoard and room may be had at prices ranging from $3.50 per week, where several stay in the same room, upwards, according to accommodations and proximity to the University, the average being $4.50 per week. Many of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. One hundred and seventy-five single rooms and fifty double rooms in the University dormitories will be reserved in the order of application upon the following terms: The price will be $4.50 for the full term of six weeks for a single room, and $7.00 for a room which will accommodate two. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied with the full amount of the fee in order to have them reserved. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer School. Rooms that are reserved will not be held later than July 6th. No room will be open for occupancy before June 18th. Each room is lighted by electricity and will contain one bed, one mattress, one pillow, one chiffonier, one table, one rocking chair, one straight chair. Wash stands and toilet sets will be provided where necessary. Roomers must provide themselves with necessary bed-clothes, towels, etc. The Randall Building, East and West Lawns and East and West Ranges will be reserved exclusively for ladies and will be under the charge of an experienced matron and chaperone, Mrs. Virgie T. Bell of the Bristol School, Washington, D. C. Some member of the faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. The rooms on Dawson's Row will be reserved for men. The location of these dormitories in the University grounds and the social advantages resulting from bringing so many teachers close together make this arrangement a very desirable one and the rooms are eagerly sought for. The University Commons, the handsome new dining-hall, is now fully completed and equipped and is being operated successfully this session. It will be open for summer students and will provide table board for three hundred and fifty persons at the very low price of $3.50 a week. Application for dormitory rooms should be sent in promptly with retaining fee, to the Registrar, Prof. Charles G. Maphis, Charlottesville, Virginia. For list of boarding houses, rates, etc., see page 51. FACULTY AND COURSES OF INSTRUCTION. The attempt is made, and it is believed to be attended with unusual success, to procure the most able specialists in their respective subjects as instructors. Few American summer schools will show a larger percentage of men of full professional rank in their faculties. Especial attention is called to the strong faculties in the standard studies usually pursued in high schools and the first few years of college instruction. The following courses are offered: Agriculture (Two Courses). Art. Astronomy. Biology (Four Courses). Field Botany. Chemistry (Two Courses). Civil Government (Two Courses). Drawing (Six Courses). Domestic Economy (Three Courses). Education (Ten Courses). English (Eight Courses). French (Two Courses). Geography (Five Courses). Geology. German (Two Courses). Greek (Five Courses). History (Eight Courses). Latin (Six Courses). Logic. Manual Training (Four Courses). Mathematics (Twelve Courses). Music (Three Courses). Nature Study. Philosophy (Three Courses). Physics (Four Courses). Physiology (One Course). Physical Training (Two Courses). Primary School Work (Two Courses). Psychology. School Gardening. Story Telling (Two Courses). Teachers' Training Class. Writing. AGRICULTURE. Professor Davis. 1. Elementary Agriculture.âThe subject is planned to be useful to teachers intending to use it in their schools. Newest things will be considered as well as the most practical and useful. Experiments suitable for schools are carried on in class room and in garden. Lessons are made real by objects and materials. Teaching is done by demonstrations and experimental proofs of principles. The following topics will be treated: Corn selection; production of good seed corn; testing seeds for vitality; butt, middle and tip kernels of seed corn; conditions for germination; testing soils for acidity; soils and their characteristics; the office of root-hairs on plants; saving soil moisture; poison in soils; rotation of crops; study of nodules on legume roots; renovation of worn out soils; clover and alfalfa seed; alfalfa in the eastern states; roots of corn plants; curing clover hay; weeds and how to kill them; cotton seed and its products; use of soiling crops; catch crops and cover crops; cuttings for house plants; layering and plant division; budding peach trees; prunning a fruit tree; the home garden; the school garden question. Lessons are subject to change and will be suitable for any who attended agricultural classes in Summer School of 1908. A simple manual will be used. Daily, from 2:30 to 3:30. Chemical Laboratory. 2. Advanced Agriculture.âThis course is intended for those who have completed a course in elementary agriculture in the Summer School or elsewhere or who have completed a course in Botany, Biology, Physics or Chemistry. There will be outlines and experimental courses in: 1. Soils and fertilizers. 2. Agricultural Botany. 3. Insects and plant diseases. 4. Principles of nutrition and animal feeding. 5. Agricultural physics and mechanics. 6. Types and breeds of farm animals with stock judging. These subjects will be taken up in a practical way and adapted to use in upper grades and high schools. Many of the experiments and demonstrations will be in the garden. Daily from 9:30 to 10:30, Chemical Laboratory. ASTRONOMY. Professor Smith. The primary object of the course is to furnish the student with such general knowledge of the subject as every well-educated person should possess. A general treatment of historical and descriptive astronomy will be given, but the course will be made practical as far as possible, including simple practical experiments, the study of the construction and use of the instruments at the Leander McCormick Observatory, telescopic observation of the heavenly bodies, and an open-air study of the summer constellations and of the motions of the moon and planets. Special attention will also be given to the explanation of everyday astronomical phenomena, questions concerning the seasons, the calendar, determination of time, eclipses, the motions of the bodies of the solar system, etc. Daily, 9:30 to 10:30. Rouss Physical Laboratory, Room 4. Text-Books.âYoung's Elements of Astronomy and either Young's Uranography or Upton's Star Atlas. BIOLOGY. Professor Tuttle. Professor Kepner. General Statement.âThe summer work in Biology at present offered makes provision for the study of each of the great divisions of the organic world: separate courses being offered in Botany and in Zoology. The object in either case is, first of all, to familiarize the student with the methods involved in the systematic study of the organization of plants or of animals; and to give such opportunity for individual work by such methods on the part of each student, under the guidance of the teacher, as will enable him or her to carry on similar work elsewhere independently with confidence and accuracy. A second object of equal importance is to give the student a clear conception of the vegetable or the animal kingdom (as the case may be) as a whole, in such manner as to impart a clear idea of the relations and significance of any particular group that may be at any time the subject of special interest. These ends are sought in each case by the presentation in the laboratory of a series of representative forms, each of which is in turn made the subject of careful study as to its organization, activities, and life-history: and by accompanying lectures, in which the results of the work in the laboratory are explained and supplemented, and the relations of the organism in question to the other forms studied and discussed. While the lecture and laboratory courses may be taken separately, they will in each case be most profitably taken together, and the examinations at the close of the session in either Botany or Zoology will cover both the lectures and the laboratory work in the subject in question. The Biological Laboratory is admirably equipped with simple and compound microscopes, microtomes and other appliances for cutting, staining, and mounting sections for microscopic study, etc.; and while the prime object of the course given will be to teach students to observe accurately, to record their observations with precision, and to make correct inferences therefrom, care will be taken to make them familiar in large measure with the principles of microscopical and other biological technic. A. BOTANY:âIn order to afford to teachers and others an opportunity to become familiar with the forms of plant life least generally understood, or most likely to offer discouraging difficulties to the beginner who undertakes them independently and unaided, the work of the Summer Session of 1909 will be devoted to the study of the Seedless (or "flowerless") Plants. This will be followed in 1910 by the study of the more familiar Seed (or "flowering") Plants, thus completing the survey of the Vegetable Kingdom in two sessions: the teacher, however, who completes faithfully and intelligently the work of this session, and becomes familiar with the methods of study and the technic involved, will find little real difficulty in applying these methods to the independent study of the organization of the higher plants. Two courses in Botany are offered, as follows: 1. Structural Botany: Use of the microscope; simpler microscopical technic. Practical study of: Fern-like plantsâa fern, an equisetum, a clubmoss; Moss-like plantsâa liverwort, a true moss; Plant-cellsâstructure, growth, modification, the methods of cell-division; Algaeâa representative brown alga, a red alga, green algae, especially the more abundant fresh water forms; Fungiâa mushroom, a cupfungus, the more important parasitic fungi, moulds and mildews, yeast; Lichens; Fission plants: the fission algae, the bacteria. Daily, from 9:30 to 11:30. Professor Tuttle. Cabell Hall, Room 12. 2. Systematic Botany: A synoptical course of lectures upon the vegetable kingdom, parallel with the laboratory course above outlined, and dealing largely with the lower plants not usually fully discussed in the text-books and the other literature commonly accessible. Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Professor Tuttle. Cabell Hall, Room 12. B. ZOOLOGY:âFor reasons analogous to those above stated in connection with the study of Plants, the work of the Summer School here offered for the study of the Animal Kingdom will be similarly divided into two portions: the work of the Summer Session of 1909 will be devoted to the study of the Invertebrates; that of the session of 1910 to the Vertebrates. Two courses in Zoology are offered, as follows: 3. Structural Zoology: Use of the microscope; simple microscopical technic. Practical study of: Protozoaâamoeba, paramecium; Coelenterates,âhydra and others; Flatworms: Threadworms, animal parasitism; Annelidsâearth-worms, nereis; Mollusksâmussel or clam; Echinodermsâstarfish, sea urchin; Crustaceaâ"water fleas." shrimps, crayfish, crabs; Insectsâgrasshopper, beetle, bee; Fundamental Tissues of animalsâthe animal cell, cell-division, maturation of the ovum, segmentation and development. Daily, from 3:30 to 5:30. Professor Kepner. Cabell Hall, Room 12. 4. Systematic Zoology.âA synoptical course of lectures upon the animal kingdom, chiefly upon the invertebrates, parallel with laboratory course above outlined. Daily, from 2:30 to 3:30. Professor Kepner. Cabell Hall, Room 12. Credits.âA student who passes the examination on the two courses in Botany will, on complying with the requirements for admission to the University, be entitled to credit for an equivalent portion of Course 1B in Botany (see the catalogue of the University). Subject to the same conditions, a student who passes the examination on the two courses in Zoology will be entitled to credit for a corresponding portion of Course 1B in Zoology. The successful completion of the courses in both subjects will satisfy the requirements in Biology for admission to the Department of Medicine. FIELD BOTANY. Professor Lambeth. The outline projected is intended to give to the student a systematized course of study, making it an easy and agreeable task for him to identify the various plant families in his locality and acquire methods of study by which children may identify and become familiar with the individual plants of their neighborhood. At the beginning of the course attention will be given to plant morphology and physiology, but the course will be of a practical character and performed in the fields and forests near the University where the plant life is diversified and rich in both indigenous and imported varieties, furnishing exceptional opportunities for the purpose. During the term each student will, under direction, collect, identify, mount, and preserve, characteristic types, so that he will have commenced the accumulation of an herbarium for use in his teaching, and to which he can continually add specimens from his own locality or that in which he is teaching. The results of the work contemplated would be of great value to the State, not only for its educational influence, but also for its economic importance as well. It would be fair to assume that with the teachers followed by their pupils working out the plants of all parts of the Commonwealth, it would only be a brief period until, from the collaboration of these collections, a complete and systematic symposium of Virginia's Flora would be available, and the information now limited to a few, and possessing only scientific importance, would become common knowledge and acquire economic value, influencing agriculture, horticulture, and many important manufacturing industries. The hours for daily excursions will be arranged as far as possible so that they will not conflict with other courses taught in the Summer School. Daily, from 5:30 to 6:30. Rotunda, S. W., Room 1. Text-Book.âDana's Manual of Botany. CHEMISTRY. Professor Bird. Instruction in Chemistry is offered to high school teachers and such others as are indicated below. The ample facilities of the School of Chemistry of the University are available and its laboratory and library will be used. 1. General Chemistry for High School Teachers.âThis course is designed to meet the individual needs of those who may have to give instruction in chemistry in high schools. It is essentially a coach class. A daily discussion of the elementary principles of the science will be held and simple lecture-table demonstrations made. Two hours a day will then be devoted to such laboratory instruction as will best fit the case of each member of the class. The sole object is to train each member to do the work that is before him, the situation that confronts each one being considered by himself. He will be told what he had best teach, what apparatus and chemicals to buy and their cost, how to equip his laboratory and how to make the best use generally of the facilities he is going to have. It is planned to have the teacher perform, under the eye of the instructor, all experiments that his own pupils should perform and such demonstration experiments as seem desirable. Special attention will be given to the fitting up of apparatus at a nominal cost, and the apparatus thus assembled may be taken away for future use. The essential pedagogic points of the experiments will be discussed fully and an effort made to show the teacher how to instill life into the laboratory work of the pupil, by pointing out its practical bearing. The chief emphasis will be laid upon the essential phenomena and laws of matter changesâ especially those of daily occurrence. Daily, 8:30 to 9:30. West Range Laboratory. 2. Laboratory Course.âThe facilities of the laboratory and library are offered to those who wish to do special work in General or Analytical Chemistry. The instruction in this course will be such as will meet the needs of: (a) One who desires experience in the analytical methods used in a particular industrial line he may seek to enter; (b) Of one who contemplates taking a civil service examination in chemistry and wishes additional laboratory instruction; and (c) Of one who needs additional laboratory experience in order to meet the entrance requirements of professional schools. Daily. Hours to be arranged. West Range Laboratory. DOMESTIC ECONOMY. Miss Charlton. 1. Domestic Science.âThis course has been arranged especially for teachers who may desire to give instruction in cooking in public schools. The lectures will include the study of foods and food values, sanitation, personal hygiene and home management. The theory and practice of cooking will be taught.

Matter and Method in the High School.âIn this course an attempt is made (1) to develop and apply criteria for the selection and valuation of studies in building up a practical course of study for high schools of various grades. The place and importance of each subject in the curriculum will be discussed. The relative worth of the topics within the several subjects will be presented. (2) Principles of special method will be developed and applied to certain high school subjects. Students will be expected to specialize in the methods of teaching the subjects with which they are most familiar. Daily, from 12:15 to 1:15. Professor Hand and Professor Payne. Cabell Hall, Room 2. 5. Principles of Teaching and Educational Psychology.âThe following topics will be treated in this course: The aim of education and the place of education in the social organism; formal discipline: the relation of psychology to teaching; the fundamental instincts and capacities, and their relation to interest and attention; the relation of interest and effort,âplay, work, drudgery and slavery, and their relation to school work; individual differencesâtheir distribution and their relation to school work, to grading, and to marking examination papers: the principle of associationâits relation to habit formation, memory, organization of experience and the correlation of studies, the specific pedagogical bearing of the foregoing; apperceptionâits psychological meaning and pedagogical significance, the necessity of basing knowledge on experience, concrete problems; analysis and reasoning. Under the head of analysis and reasoning, the following lesson types will be developed and illustrated: Inductive lesson; deductive lesson (anticipatory type and explanatory type); apperceptive lesson; study lesson; drill lesson; review lesson. The essential steps of each, together with their psychological functions will be brought out. The recitation, its functions and the assignment of the lesson will be also discussed. The following additional topics will be discussed: Moral training âthe fundamental roots of character, the principles of moral training, the relation of the teacher, school activities, and school studies to moral training; the cultivation of the emotions, especially the Ã¦sthetic; motor expression and trainingâthe teaching of form and of execution, the place of motor activities in school. In connection with each topic, the underlying facts and principles of psychology are reviewed or taught as the case may be, and exercises in application will be given to the extent that time allows.

Daily, from 3:30 to 4:30. Professor Heatwole. Cabell Hall, Room 3. Text-Books.âMonroe's Brief Course in Education. ENGLISH. Professor McBryde. Professor Mims. Professor Reade. The courses in English are designed to meet the needs of the following groups of students: Present or prospective high school teachers; professional or technical students who have entered upon their professional courses and found that their training in English is so defective as to interfere with their prospects of success in their chosen profession; students preparing for college entrance examinations; students conditioned on their entrance examinations or in their college courses at other institutions; college professors and instructors who may be especially interested in methods of teaching English. 1. English Grammar and Composition.âTalks on English grammar and composition, designed especially for high school teachers. No subjects in the high school curriculum are more unsettled than those of grammar and composition, both being in a transitive stage. The multiplication of high schools in the South has called attention afresh to the importance of English but there is still little uniformity in methods or standards. The members of the class are requested to bring with them any English grammars that they may be using. Daily, from 2:30 to 3:30. Professor McBryde. Cabell Hall, Room 4. Text-Book.âSmith's Our Language, and Studies in English Syntax. 2. Rhetoric and Composition.âThe purpose of this course will be three-fold: First, to master as far as possible the subject matter of the text-book, and in doing this to emphasize particularly accuracy and correctness in writing; second, to indicate the best methods of teaching this subject in the schools, so as to interest the pupils and induce them to take advantage of local material and opportunities; third, to encourage among teachers and pupils alike good reading both for its own sake and specifically for the sake of mental discipline. There will be daily original exercises. Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Professor McBryde. Cabell Hall, Room 4. Text-Book.âThomas and Howe's Composition and Rhetoric (Long-mans. Green and Co.) and Woodley's Handbook of Composition (Heath). 3. English Literature.âA general survey of the history of English literature from Milton and Tennyson. Special emphasis will be laid upon the writings that are adapted to high school work and more specifically college entrance requirements. An attempt will be made to give suggestions for future work in all the periods. Daily, from 9:30 to 10:30. Professor Reade. Cabell Hall, Room 4. Text-Books.âAny edition of the classics mentioned above; any good history of English literature (preferably Pancoast's), and Manly's English Poetry. 4.

Stress will be laid on the poetry of Poe and Lanier and on the fiction of the writers since the War. Students will be required to do research work in neglected fields of literary history, such as the history of Southern magazines, the development of short stories, and dialect as an element in literature. This course is intended for those who have graduated at some standard college. Daily, from 12:15 to 1:15. Professor Mims. Cabell Hall, Room 4. Text-Books.âTrent's Southern Writers, and Baskerville's Southern Writers (vol. I.). 6. Expression.âIn view of the larger requirements of the English course of today, the need of thorough training in the Art of Expressio comes a matter of vital interest to teachers of literature, for it is only through a knowledge of this art that the best results can be obtained. Two things should be required of teachers of English: First, that they should be free from the common faults of speech; and second, that they should possess the power of sympathetic interpretation. To these two ends the work of this department is addressed. Instruction in Elocution is twofold in its nature; on its negative side, it aims to correct faults which would detract from an otherwise good rendition of the masterpieces of literature; while on its positive side it endeavors to bring out individual talent and to inspire such sympathy with the text as may result in a simple, natural and effective reading. Above all things, the aim of any course in public speaking should be to develop the personality of the student, not to make him a mere imitator. In the course proposed it is the intention of the instructor to give the students such things as may be of practical value to them, not to burden them with mere rules and theory. It need hardly be pointed out that this course is not intended for teachers of literature only. Anyone who expects in his life work to make large use of the voice will find the course helpful. The hour's lesson will be divided into two parts. There will be first a lecture on some phase of the subject (with illustrative readings), which will be followed by individual and class exercises bearing upon the matter under discussion. Assignments will be made each day of selections to be studied which will be read or recited by members of the class. This will be followed by criticisms from the instructor. The lectures will deal with such subjects as thought-reading, emphasis, breaking, articulation, phonetics, expression, reading of poetry, quality, pitch, force, time, the tunes of speech, gesture, dialogue, dramatic reading, and impersonation. Students who intend to take the work in American and English Literature are especially urged to avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by this course. Members of the class are requested to provide themselves with note-books. Daily, from 3:30 to 4:30. Professor Reade. Cabell Hall, Room 4. Text-Book.âShoemaker's Practical Elocution. The following are recommended for reference: Murdoch-Russell's Vocal Culture; Kofler's Art of Breaking; Lanier's Science of English Verse. Credit.âAny student who fulfills the conditions set forth, pages 14 and 15, and who completes successfully the first four courses in English outlined above, will be credited with course A in English Literature. Those who have completed the entire six courses may arrange for relative credit with the professor of English at the University. FRENCH. Professor Stewart. 1. Elementary French.âGrammar, through the regular verbs: exercises and dictations; the principles of pronunciation are insisted upon; four hundred pages of modern French prose are read.

Credit.âStudents having fulfilled the conditions on pages 14 and 15 and having completed both these courses and passed the corresponding examination in each will be considered as having absolved the requirements of French 1A, and will be admitted to French 2B (See catalogue of the University of Virginia, page â) of the University's college course. GEOGRAPHY. Professor Carney. 3. Physical Geography.âSeries of field lessons illustrating erosion, corrosion, valley development, river basins, sedimentation, etc. (Indispensable as insuring vitality to the course.) Physical relief of continents illustrated by chalk modeling and land maps: resultant continental drainage: volcanoes and earthquakes in connection with mountain building.

Texts.âAny good manual, Davis' Elementary Physical Geography preferred. GEOLOGY. Professor Smith. A general course in the elements of the subject will be offered. In connection with the study of each geological process will be treated the land forms and rock formations which it has produced. Thus the dynamical, structural and physiographic phases of the subject will be treated simultaneously. If time permits, the study of historical geology will be taken up with especial emphasis upon the development of North America. The instruction will be given through lectures and the study of a good text, and an effort will be made to have as much field work as practicable. Daily, from 10:30 to 11:30. Rouss Physical Laboratory, Room 4. Text-Book.âNorton's Elements of Geology. GERMAN. Professor Edward. Two courses in German are offered, six hours lectures a week in each course. In the course for beginners no previous knowledge of German is required. In preparation for the advanced course, at least two years' high school work in German or its equivalent is necessary. As the work in both courses is arranged on the supposition that the student in either course will devote at least eighteen hours a week outside of lectures to the preparation for lectures and to parallel reading, students taking either course are strongly urged to enroll themselves for not more than one other course in the Summer School. Students attaining a grade of 75% in either course will be given a certificate of successful completion of the course in question. In computing this grade, class standing is based on a daily written test during the first fifteen minutes of the hour, covering the subject-matter of the preceding lecture, and the other written work of the class will be reckoned at 50%; and examination standing at 50%. Unexcused absences are graded as zero. Excused absences may be made up by taking in some other hour than that of the regular lecture a written class test covering the regular class test for the day on which the absence was recorded. 1. Course for Beginners.âPronunciation, dictation exercises, elements of German grammar (eighteen hours); reading of simple German (prose and poetry)âconversation on matter read (eighteen hours); parallel reading to be assigned.

The advance course in German is exactly equivalent in character and scope to the second term's work in German 2B in the regular session of the University, and has been approved as such by the Academic Faculty of the University. Corresponding credits therefore will be granted by the Academic Faculty to the students successfully completing this course, who have fulfilled conditions set forth on pages 14 and 15. GREEK. Professor Hays. Professor Fitzhugh. 1. Homer.âOpen to every one free of charge. For teachers in high schools and academics, for college preparation, and for students of literature and lovers of Homer at large. This course is an invaluable accompaniment to the study of Vergil. The Homeric poems were the great literary monument of European culture and the ultimate source of all subsequent artistic inspiration. They were the models which Vergil kept always before him. The Iliad will therefore be read and interpreted in its relation to human culture, in general, and to the Ãneid of Vergil in particular, upon every page of which it shows illuminating and inspiring light.

It will be the aim of the courses in Latin to open to all teachers and students of Latin the advantages of University instruction in that subject. The study of Latin is the study of the language, literature, and life of the Romans. Every course will, therefore, have due regard in each of these interest. Couse 1 is preparatory; thereafter, the work is organized in all course as follows: The Latin languageâsystematic study of Latin grammar, with oral and written exercises in prose composition, Latin literatureâ systematic study of the Latin author in culture-historical sequence; Roman lifeâsystematic study of Roman culture-history in English, in conjunction with the reading of the authors.

Beginners' Course.âFor teachers in high schools and academies, for college preparation, and for students of Latin at large. This course is devoted to the Beginner's Book in Latin and concludes with elementary Latin reading. It involves: the Roman pronunciation; careful study of accent and quantity; thorough drill in declensions and conjugations; the fundamental principles of the syntax of the cases, tenses, and moods; accusative, and infinitive, relative and conditional sentences; the fundamental uses of the subjunctive; and the main laws of indirect discourse. These grammatical principles are illustrated in systematic exercises in translating easy detached sentences into Latin. Translation into English of simple Latin prose preparatory to CÃ¦sar. Daily, from 8:30 to 9:30. Professor Montgomery. Cabell Hall, Room 1. Text-Book.âBennett's Foundation of Latin. 2.

Courses 5 and 6 are intended to open up to teachers and summer students the more important fields of college Latin. They are devoted to the broad cultural study of the language, literature, and life of the Romans. Roman civilization is the link between the Hellenic and the modern: the instruction will aim, therefore, to exhibit this relation, and so, to emphasize the unity and continuity of all human culture. The desirability of a knowledge of Greek and of at least one Romanic language is especially commended to all who would reap the full cultural and scientific benefit of the college course in Latin: the Greek illumines incomparably all parts of Latin study, which in turn bears fascinatingly upon the Romanic. 5. Livy (one third College course).âFor teachers in colleges, for college students, and for students of Latin at large. This course is identical with that of the first term of 2B in the catalogue of the University of Virginia.

It is presumed that students attending the course have had a previous knowledge of the subject as a whole or in part. The lectures and quizzes will be framed therefore with the view of strengthening and harmonizing the knowledge of plane geometry. There will be discussed for historical development the logical connection of the theorems and processes of elementary geometry; the definitions of the fundamental geometrical concepts; the axioms of geometry and the nature of geometrical proof; the systematic study of the original solution and methods of attack of geometrical problems; the theory of geometric graphical solution, and the problems of quadrature of the circle.

THE VIRGINIA SUMMER SCHOOL OF ART. SIXTH SESSION. Ten weeks, June 22nd, to August 28 inclusive. F. Graham Cootes, M. A., Founder and Director. This School offers art instruction comparable to that of the best Northern summer schools with the additional great advantage of more personal attention than is given in any other art school. The standard of the Schools has been steadily raised and every effort will be made to continue this policy. The Object of this school is to furnish Southern students, at a minimum expense, practical instruction in drawing and painting, according to the methods of the very best New York and Parisian schools, with the additional great advantage of more personal attention than is given at any other art school. The Course is particularly designed for those desirous of making a profession of portrait, landscape and decorative painting, illustrating, cartooning and the designing of posters and advertisements. It will also be of great benefit to teachers and those who are interested in art for their own pleasure. Beginners will receive special attention. No previous experience will be required for entrance to the school. The instruction is entirely individual and adapted to the particular needs and advancement of the student. A Model in Costume poses every morning, except Saturday, in the large studio. The afternoons are devoted to landscape work. A scholarship, consisting of free tuition for one term, is offered to the Richmond Art League. The name of the Instructor will be announced later in a special prospectus, which may be had upon application to F. GRAHAM COOTES, Broadway Arcade Studios, 1947 Broadway, New York, N. Y. THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA SUMMER COURSE IN PREVENTIVE MEDICINE. Since the recent reorganization of the Medical School of the University of Virginia it has become evident that much more study should be devoted to the courses dealing particularly with preventive medicine and the public health. The extensive distribution of preventable diseases, such as typhoid fever, malaria, tuberculosis, and hook-worm disease, with their burden of suffering and economic loss, is becoming a matter deserving greater attention in the Southern States in view of the facts that, on the one hand they have now entered upon a period of extensive development, and on the other, that these diseases can be attacked with such success by the application of well-known principles. Although medical science has already reached a point at which it can prescribe definite and fairly simple rules for the control of many of our serious epidemic diseases, and although one trained hygienist can, if supported by the community, prevent more cases of disease than many physicians can treat, it is, nevertheless, remarkable how slight is the public interest in this phase of self-protection, and how inadequate is the attention bestowed upon the training of hygienists in most of our institutions. With a view to correcting this condition of affairs, the University of Virginia is about to inaugurate courses for the training of those interested in subjects connected with the preservation and improvement of the public health. The courses to be offered will include: A short course of six weeks duration, from June 14th to July 24th, 1909, for medical health officers, medical inspectors, or similar public officers. A four years' course, to be started in September, 1909, for the training of sanitary engineers. A course of lectures upon selected topics of public health. Some of these lectures will be intended especially for the public health students, the others will be open to all students in the University. The second and third of these courses will be inaugurated at the opening of the session of 1909-1910, and announcements will appear in an early number of the University "Record." The short course for medical inspectors, members of local Boards of Health, and other students of public health questions, will begin immediately after the close of the present session. The health officers of the cities, towns and counties are drawn, almost exclusively, from the ranks of practicing physicians, and, as the demands upon health officers increase, they are coming to require special knowledge and training of a kind not given in medical schools. The six weeks' course will furnish an introduction to the special subjects required; it is offered to those just entering the medical profession as a preparation for positions on boards of health, and to those already holding such positions it is offered as an aid to assist in performing their duties with greater satisfaction to themselves and their communities. The subjects included in the course are as follows: Courses of Studies in Preventive Medicine for Summer 1909. ChemistryâTuesday, Thursday, Saturday, 9 to 10:30. First Week, June 14-19.âChemistry of AirâFood Preservatives. Second Week, June 21-26.âWater and Sewage AnalysisâLectures and Demonstrations.

It will be noticed that the subjects offered by no means constitute a complete course in preventive medicine, nor is any subject exhaustively considered. The main object sought is to review the matters of immediate importance in as practical and condensed a manner as possible. Chemistry will be taught by Dr. Bird through lectures and demonstrations at which the students assist. One period will be given up to the examination of the air, with special reference to methods of analysis and the value to be attached to the results. Another period will be given to the subject of food preservatives, their detection and influence upon health. The students will be taught proper methods of collecting and transmitting specimens of water and sewage for examination. A number of lectures and demonstrations will be devoted to the chemical examination of water, to a discussion of the fate of carbon and nitrogen, and to a consideration of the value of chemical examinations in sanitary and epidemiologic investigation. Bacteriology will be taught by Drs. Marshall and Meloy. After a week spent in general technical training, the class will study the bacteria of the air, water, and sewage, and will discuss the value of such examinations, sources of error, etc. Biologic methods of water and sewage purification will be observed. This will be followed by a study of the bacteriology of typhoid fever, with special reference to laboratory methods of diagnosis and serum reactions. The basteriology of milk will be treated briefly and the remainder of the time will be spent in learning the laboratory methods of making the diagnosis in cases of diphtheria, tuberculosis, malaria, and hook-worm disease. Dr. Lambeth will devote fifteen periods to selected topics in Hygiene, such as food, ventilation, heating and plumbing, and to the subject of Vital Statistics. In Medicine, Drs. Davis and Flippin will show at rounds any cases of infections diseases which may be in the wards, and will hold six recitations upon the clinical methods of diagnosing selected infectious diseases. Epidemiology will be taught by members of the medical faculty of the University and by visiting lecturers. In this course will be considered diphtheria, small-pox, the insect carriers of disease, typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and uncinariasis. Lectures will be given also upon the practical workings and the organization of Boards of Health. The names of the lecturers will be announced later. By an arrangement with the Summer School of the University, students in hygiene may take advantage of the low rates for board and lodging offered to students in the Summer School. (See pages 16 and 17 of the "Record.") At the end of the term examinations will be conducted and successful candidates will receive certificates stating the subjects in which they have demonstrated proficiency. Applicants may take the entire course, or so much of it as they desire. No entrance examinations are required. The fee for attending the whole course, or any part of it, is $25.00.
