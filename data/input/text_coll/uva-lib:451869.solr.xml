      <field name="fulltext">V THE GUEST AND THE SERVICE BUILDINGS INTRODUCTION TO VOLUME II IN addition to the nuclear block of monastic buildings—the Church, the Cloister, the Novitiate and the Infirmary —the Plan of St. Gall exhibits a host of subsidiary structures of a type that in the Middle Ages was as common to secular life as it was indispensable to the economy of a monastic community. Thirty of the forty separate buildings shown on the Plan are in this category (frontispiece). They can be classified by their respective functions: 1 Facilities for the reception of visitors: Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers; House for Distinguished Guests; House for the Emperor's Vassals; House for Servants from Outlying Estates and for Servants Travelling with the Emperor's Court. 2 Medical facilities: House for Bloodletting; House of the Physicians. 3 Facilities for the education of students living outside the regular monastic discipline: Outer School; and Schoolmaster's Lodging. 4 Industrial facilities: Great Collective Workshop; and House for Wheelwrights and Coopers. 5 Facilities for storing, milling, crushing and parching grain: Granary; Mill; Mortar; and Drying Kiln. 6 Facilities for baking and brewing: Monks' Bake and Brew House; Kitchen, Bake and Brew House for Pilgrims and Paupers; Kitchen, Bake and Brew House for Distinguished Guests. 7 Facilities for gardening and for fruit growing: House of the Gardener and his Crew; Monks' Vegetable Garden; Monks' Orchard; and the Medicinal Herb Garden. 8 Facilities for raising livestock and poultry: House for Horses and Oxen and their Keepers; House for Cows and Cowherds; House for Brood Mares, Foals, and their Keepers, House for Goats and Goatherds; House for Swine and Swineherds; House for Sheep and Shepherds; House of the Fowlkeepers; Hen House; and Goose House. In turning from the study of the Church and the claustral complex to that of the monastery's guest and service buildings we are stepping from the intensely studied precinct of ecclesiastical architecture into the less-known territory of vernacular building. To determine the appearance of these buildings as three-dimensional entities, as I have stated earlier in this study, would be a breakthrough both in illuminating the history of monastic building and in contributing to our knowledge of the vernacular architecture of the period. It would visually reconstruct the architectural panorama of virtually the entire Carolingian countryside. I was asked to take on this task in 1963 when, in the planning sessions for the Council of Europe Exhibition Karl der Grosse in Aachen, the desire was voiced that this display should include a model reconstruction of the architecture shown on the Plan of St. Gall. Had I not been assured of the support of Ernest Born and his associate Carl Bertil Lund (who did most of the architectural drafting required for this project) I could not have accepted responsibility for this task. All of our reconstructions of individual buildings, published in these volumes, are based on working drawings made for the Aachen model. We are not, of course, the first to have tried our hand at such a reconstruction. The problems involved have puzzled students of the Plan for over a century and led to a variety of fascinating and perplexing conjectures. In reviewing these earlier attempts we are far from merely rendering a plain historiographical account. They strikingly manifest how unstable are our cultural perspectives. Occasionally they alarmingly reveal how disciplinary bias may distort historical inquiry. In 1844 when this story began, the eyes of the learned world were turned toward the great achievements of classical antiquity. All of the earlier students of the Plan inevitably reflected this overriding cultural preoccupation by interpreting the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall in the light of Greco-Roman, Etruscan, and even Near Eastern prototype forms. The sixth and seventh decade of the last century, by contrast, witnessed a growing interest in Germanistic studies coupled with increasing curiosity about the vernacular architectural traditions of the north. As was to be expected, this generated a variety of new interpretations, some clearly incompatible with the views put forth by the classicists. The movement for Germanistic interpretation found strong support, toward the close of the century, in a number of literary and philological studies devoted to the subject of house construction (mainly by Scandinavian scholars), and reached its peak from 1930 onward in a veritable flood of new archaeological discoveries in the pre- and protohistoric territories of Germany, Holland and the Scandinavian countries, including such faraway places as Iceland and Greenland. The insights gained by the men who conducted this work enable us to see the problem of the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall in its proper historical perspective. But because their findings were published in journals that lay outside the reading range of professional architectural historians of the Middle Ages, progress in interpreting the Plan was impeded. There have been other deterrents. For generations the history of architecture has been plagued by a peculiar and seemingly ineradicable prejudice against the study of vernacular building. Because of this bias, vast gaps exist where knowledge resulting from proper study would help us to solve our problems. Obviously our image of the design of the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall depends on the analysis not only of their proto-and prehistoric antecedents but also of their medieval derivative forms. A good deal of groundwork had to be done in both fields. In the final analysis the guest and service buildings turned out to be a vital link between past and present. They are the exponents of a building tradition which has its origins in the second millennium B.C., runs in an undisrupted flow through the entire transalpine history of medieval and modern Europe and has as yet not reached its point of termination. A variety of fascinating modern survival forms affect the rural architecture of even today. It has been a refreshing and rewarding experience to close these historical gaps by moving simultaneously into all of these fields. I shall not regret having had to cut the umbilical cord which tied me to ecclesiastical architecture in order to find the time required to accomplish this task, nor deplore the delays it imposed on the completion of this volume. It is hardly necessary for me to re-emphasize, in the introduction to the second volume of this study of the Plan of St. Gall, that although the history of architecture is my primary concern this inquiry is not confined to architectural problems. My objective is to comprehend the whole of life of the people for which these buildings were planned. This takes us into an analysis of the spectrum of monastic hospitality, the monastery's medical practices, its share in the education of the secular world, its complex industrial activities (including the use of water power for the milling and crushing of grain), monastic gardening and, last but not least, the monastery's practices in the breeding and rearing of livestock. V. 1 PREVIOUS INTERPRETATIONS V.1.1. THE CLASSICAL SCHOOL FERDINAND KELLER, 1844 The first to speculate about the design of the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall was Ferdinand Keller. In his "facsimile" edition of the Plan, published in 1844, Keller described them as structures "of oriental style in which the living quarters are arranged around an open central court toward which the roof slopes down from all four sides of the building."1 1 Keller, 1844, 15: "Fast alle grösseren Häuser sind im orientalischen Stile erbaut, indem sie in ihrer Mitte einen Hof einschliessen, nach welchem sich von allen vier Seiten die Dächer absenken." The idea is elaborated further in the chapters that deal with the individual structures. He remarks, with regard to the Outer School (p. 25): "Sie ist ein weitläuftiges Gebäude mit einem Hof in der Mitte, welcher durch eine Mauer in zwei Hälften getheilt ist. In jeder Abtheilung bemerkt man ein Viereck mit der Bezeichnung testudo, worunter zwei Gartenhäuschen, oder die ausser allen Verhältnis klein vorgestellten gemeinschaftlichen Schulzimmer zu verstehen sind"; with regard to the Paupers' Hospice (p. 27): "Die vier Flügel dieses Gebäudes schliessen einen Hofraum ein dessen Mitte von einem kleinen Hause, testudo, besetzt ist"; with regard to the Great Collective Workshop (p. 30): "Es schliesst zwei viereckige Höfe ein, in deren Mitte zwei kleine, von den Meistern oder Aufsehern bewohnte Häuschen, domus et officina camerarii, stehen"; with regard to the six agricultural buildings for livestock and visiting servants (p. 33): "Jedes dieser sechs Gebäude schliesst einen Hof ein, in welchem ein kleines, vielleicht von den Aufseher bewohntes oder zum Aufenthalte der Knechte bestimmtes Häuschen steht." Keller explained the squares —which are designated by the term testu* * In the entire literature on the Plan of St. Gall the term testu (literally "skull" or "lid") has been interpreted, without exception, as standing for testudo (literally "tortoise," by extension "protective cover," "roof" or "vault"). Later on in this study, I give the reasons for which I think this interpretation is in error (see below, p. 117). In order to keep the reader apprised of the fact that testudo is improper exegesis, I am putting the terminal syllable do into brackets (testu[do]), whenever I refer to the views of other students of the Plan who interpret the term in its traditional meaning. in the explanatory titles—as "courtyard houses" or "garden huts." He did not illustrate his views with graphic reconstructions, but the kind of structures he had in mind must have resembled the houses sketched in figure 264 A-C. Keller's interpretation is perplexing because it contradicts the explanatory titles of the Plan itself, which he had so carefully transcribed, translated, and annotated. In seven out of the nine times this house-type appears on the Plan of St. Gall, the area that Keller interprets as an open inner court is explicitly designated as the "common" or "principal" room of the house by inscriptions such as domus communis (House of the Fowlkeeper), domus ipsa (House for Sheep and Shepherds), domus familiae (House for Visiting Servants), domus pauperum et peregrinorum (House for Pilgrims and Paupers). Keller, however, was not truly consistent in this matter; for in the case of the House for Distinguished Guests, where the function of the center area as an indoor space is visually elaborated by the insertion of pieces of indoor furniture such as tables (mensae), benches, and a fireplace (locus foci), he interprets the center space of the house correctly—and in full accord with its identifying inscription as "dining room" (domus ad prandendum). The incompatibility of this interpretation with that of the other guest and service structures as open courtyard houses does not appear to have raised any doubts in his mind of the validity of the latter. ALBERT LENOIR, 1852 We do not know what specific prototypes Keller had in mind when he explained the St. Gall house as the descendant of an oriental courtyard house, but once this idea was suggested it was inevitable that the design of the St. Gall house should also be connected with that of the Roman atrium house. This idea was pursued in 1852 by Albert Lenoir.2 2 Lenoir, I, 1852, 25-26. Lenoir derived the St. Gall house from a subvariety of the Roman atrium house that Vitruvius had called "Tuscan" (tuscanum)—a house with an open inner court which was partially roofed over (fig. 265), but which retained in its center a large rectangular "rainhole" (compluvium) and on the ground below it, the classical Roman rain catch basin (impluvium). To the difficulties of Keller's reconstruction, Lenoir thus added a further one, since testu[do] can be translated as neither "rainhole" nor "catch basin." Whatever the specific implications of this term may be, its basic meaning, "tortoise" or "turtle shell," points in the opposite direction, namely, to that of a protective shield or cover.3 3 Cf. above p. 2, and below pp. 117ff. Lenoir himself appears to have entertained some doubt with regard to the suitability of such a reconstruction for a house in a northern climate when he states (p. 26): "Si, en raison de la température froide de nos contrées, on suppose cette ouverture close par des vitres, sa disposition sur l'atrium toscan n'est pas moins celle de l'antiquité. Dans les bâtiments ruraux on retrouve aussi ce carré figuré au centre; là, plus qu'ailleurs, il peut figurer un impluvium, bassin recevant les pluviales par l'ouverture du toit ou compluvium." J. R. RAHN, 1876 Probably aware of these inconsistencies in Keller's and Lenoir's interpretations, the Swiss art historian J. R. Rahn presented a new solution in 1876, which was incorporated into a graphical reconstruction of the entire settlement in a bird's-eye view drawn up for him by Georg Lasius (fig. 266).4 4 Rahn, 1876, 91, fig. 12. Without explicitly refuting or even discussing Keller's and Lenoir's views, Rahn reconstructed the St. Gall house as a masonry structure of basilican type with a PLAN OF ST. GALL. OUTER SCHOOL.* * BUILDING 12: PLAN page xxiv, vol. I INTERPRETATION OF KELLER (1844). AUTHORS' DRAWING 264.C PERSPECTIVE SHOWING INTERNAL OPEN COURT Houses with living quarters ranged around an open inner court were in use in the Euphrates river basin in the Isin Larsin period (20241763 B.C.) in the city of Ur (H. Frankfort, The Art and Architecture of the Ancient Orient, Harmondsworth, 1958, 66). They form the point of origin of an illustrious lineage of Near Eastern and Mediterranean courtyard houses which in Classical Antiquity evolved into the beautifully conceived symmetrical layout of the Greek peristyle house and the Roman atrium house (fig. 265). 264.B PERSPECTIVE WITH ROOF STRUCTURE REMOVED Keller's interpretation of the two squares drawn in the center space of this house as "courtyard houses" or "garden huts" is incompatible with the annotation of the Plan, on which they are clearly labeled "testu", indicating a feature of the roof on a ground floor plan. See below, pp. 117ff, and III, Glossary, s.v. The presence of "testu" demonstrates that the house was roofed over, and did not have an open court. 264.A THE PLAN IN PERSPECTIVE The squares in the center space are the designer's way of indicating the location of a hearth. In the House for Distinguished Guests (see below, pp. 146, 160) this square is explicitly so designated (LOCUS FOCI). For this and the reason explained above, this part of the house must have been roofed over. large rectangular center room that rose above the outer rooms and received its light through clerestory windows. The squares that are inscribed in the Plan alternately as locus foci and testu[do] Rahn interprets as open fireplaces surmounted on the level of the main roof by a lantern with openings for the escape of smoke. This solution was suggested to him by similar architectural contraptions "still nowadays in use in certain rural houses of northern Germany and also occasionally found in England."5 5 The statement is not further substantiated. Rahn, however, was not the first to suggest such a solution. It was considered as early as 1848 by Robert Willis (1848). Willis' interpretation of the St. Gall house vacillates between that of Keller, whom he follows closely in his general description of the Plan, and suggestions that could be called anticipations of Rahn's and Lenoir's views, as may be gathered from the following quotations: in connection with the House for Distinguished Guests (p. 90): "This central room either rose above the roofs of the others, so as to allow for small open windows like clerestory windows, or else the central room was so roofed over as to leave a small square opening in the middle, which admitted light and allowed the smoke of the fire to escape. In warm southerly climates, as at Pompeii, the opening had a cistern below to receive rain. But in the north, if a fire-place was below it, the central opening must have been covered with a sort of turret or lantern, with open sides, to prevent the rain from pouring down upon the fire"; with regard to the other buildings (p. 91): "I am inclined to think that . . . the central square in most of the examples . . . represents the central opening of a roof, which roof may either slope outwards or inwards, as the case may be"; with regard to the farm buildings (p. 91): "In the great farm buildings at the south-west part of the establishment the small central square may indicate that the central space has an overhanging shed carried round it, leaving the opening in the middle; or if this appears improbable, we must suppose in this case that it means a pond for water, or, as Keller seems to think, a little cabin or sentry-box, which I confess does not appear very likely." Rahn's reconstruction has subsequently found the widest circulation by being reproduced in Cabrol-Leclercq's Dictionnaire d'archéologie chrétienne.6 6 Article "St. Gall," by Leclercq, in Cabrol-Leclercq, VI:1, 1924, cols. 80-248. It also formed the basis for a masterful three-dimensional model, executed in 1877 by Julius Lehmann, which found a permanent home in the Historisches Museum of the city of St. Gall (fig. 267).7 7 On the history of the construction of this model see Edelmann, in Studien, 1962, 291-95. The model in turn served as prototype for a painting made by B. Steiner in 1903 for use in school instruction, which shows the monastery from the south east. This painting has never been published, so far as I have been able to determine. It places the settlement shown on the Plan of St. Gall into the topographic relief of the site on which the monastery of the Abbey of St. Gall rose. Since it adds nothing to the concept of the buildings established by Rahn and Lasius, I pass over it. The advantages of Rahn's reconstruction over those of Keller and Lenoir are obvious at first sight. It establishes correctly, and in accordance with the legends of the Plan, the large rectangular center space of the house as a covered room. Second, it associates the term testu[do] with a device that is compatible with its etymology (protective shield, or cover). Third, it offers a constructive solution to the interchangeability of the terms testu[do] and locus foci, since "hearth" and "lantern," if arranged in the manner Rahn suggested, would merely be two complementary aspects of the same device—namely, an open fire with a smoke hole in the roof surmounted by a lantern. JULIUS VON SCHLOSSER, 1889 Rahn's reconstruction of the St. Gall house as a basilican masonry structure with a lantern-surmounted central hearth had been a purely theoretical venture. He could not prove—and did not even attempt to prove—that houses of this description actually existed. Misconceptions about the "displuviate" and "testudinate" Roman courtyard house Julius von Schlosser8 8 Schlosser, 1889, 26ff. tried to overcome this weakness by demonstrating that Rahn's St. Gall house was historically the descendant of a once widespread Roman house type to which the ancients referred with the terms "displuviate" (displuviatum) and "testudinate" (testudinatum). Schlosser's theory, unfortunately, was based on two erroneous assumptions that were current in his day, which imparted to the discussion of the design of the guest and service structures of the Plan of St. Gall an element of further confusion. The first of these misconceptions pertained to the precise meaning of the terms "displuviate" and "testudinate"; the second concerned the origins and structural evolution of the Roman atrium house. To begin with the former: what Vitruvius and Varro designated by the terms "displuviate" and "testudinate" can under no circumstances be interpreted as structures of basilican design. They were atrium houses in the full constructional sense of the term, i.e., houses in which the living quarters were ranged around an originally open center space. The terms "Tuscan", "Corinthian", as well as "tetrastyle", "displuviate", and "testudinate" (tuscanicum, corinthium, tetrastylon, displuviatum, and testudinatum) merely referred to the different degree or manner in which these inner courtyards were roofed over.9 9 Vitruvius deals with this subject in De Architectura, Book VI, chap. 3, par 1; cf. Vitruvii de Architectura Libri Decem, ed. F. Krohn, 1912, 129-30. Varro, in De Lingua Latina, Book V, lines 161ff, ed. Goetz and Schoell, 1910, 49; ed. Kent, I, 1951, 150-51. In the Tuscan atrium house, for instance, the courtyard roof sloped down toward the center (fig. 265); in the displuviate house it sloped upward. But in both cases the courtyard roof encompassed in its center a rainhole (compluvium) that had under it not a hearth, but a catch basin (impluvium). Schlosser did not realize that in connecting the St. Gall house with the displuviate Roman atrium house, he had actually retrogressed to Lenoir's views (fig. 265), whose weakness Rahn's reconstruction (fig. 266) had already successfully overcome. The same applied to Schlosser's attempt to connect the St. Gall house with the courtyard house referred to by Vitruvius and Varro by the term "testudinate." It is an atrium house like all the others, as must be inferred not only from the language of the opening sentence with which ROMAN ATRIUM HOUSE WITH RAIN CATCH-BASIN 265.B PERSPECTIVE redrawn after Kähler, 1960, suppl. 53, fig. 31 265.C 265.A PLAN, based on Luckenbach, Kunst and Geschichte, I: Altertum, Munich, 1910, 94 SECTION, authors' interpretation The plot, 60 feet wide, is 1/2 ACTUS (120 feet) See remarks on Roman land surveyor's measure, page III. 140 In the form here shown, the Roman atrium house has its open inner court partially covered by an inward-sloping roof with its center open to the rain (COMPLUVIUM); beneath this opening in the center of the court is a collecting basin (IMPLUVIUM). The dining room (TABLINUM) lies to the rear of the house and opens onto the garden (HORTUS). The kitchen stove might have been located in any of the cubicles adjacent to it. Vitruvius introduces his subject ("Cava aedium quinque generibus sunt distincta . . ."; "the inner courts of houses are of five different styles," etc.), but also from the detailed descriptions that follow ("Testudinata vero ibi fiunt, ubi non sunt impetus magni et in contignationibus supra spatiosae redduntur habitationes . . ."; "Testudinate courtyards are employed when the span is not great, and they furnish roomy apartments in the story above").10 10 Vitruvius, loc. cit. Varro (ibid.) is even more specific: "Cavum aedium dictum qui locus tectus intra parietes relinquebatur patulus, qui esset ad communem omnium usum. In hoc locus si nullus relictus erat, sub divo qui esset, dicebatur testudo ab testudinis similitudine, ut est in praetorio et castris. Si relictum erat in medio ut lucem carperet, deorsum quo impluebat, dictum impluvium, susum qua compluebat, compluvium: utrumque a pluvia," i.e., " `Inner Court' is the designation for the roofed part that is left open within the house walls, for common use by all. If, in this, no place was left which is open to the sky, it was called a testudo, as it is at the general's headquarters and in the camps. If some space was left in the center to get the light, the place into which the rain fell down was called the impluvium, and the place where it ran together up above was called the compluvium; both from pluvia, `rain.' " In contradistinction to the other four types in which the courtyard was only partially roofed over, the testudinate atrium house was a house in which the inner court was entirely covered. It was an atrium house in which the courtyard had lost the character of an open space by being covered over with a second story, but it was still an atrium house.11 11 Frank Granger, in his English version of Vitruvius' De Architectura, (Vitruvius On Architecture, II, 1934, 25) renders "testudinate," incorrectly as "vaulted"; Erich Stürzenacker in his German version (Marcus Vitruvius Pollo, Über Die Baukunst, 1938, no pagination), correctly as "ganz überdeckte Höfe"; cf. also Pauly-Wissowa, Real-Encyclopädie der classischen Altertamswissenschaft, IX:1 (1934), col. 1063. The Romans used this type of construction in houses of relatively small dimensions, as Vitruvius himself suggests, and probably in response to restricted land conditions prevailing in the crowded Roman cities. The Roman atrium: an open yard developing into a covered court Schlosser's misinterpretation of Vitruvius' and Varro's definitions of the displuviate and testudinate Roman atrium house was in itself conditioned by the faulty historical assumption held by many leading classical archaeologists at that time, that the Roman atrium was originally not a court but the principal living room of the house which gradually developed into an open yard.12 12 This view, vigorously advanced in Ruge's article "Atrium," in Pauly-Wissowa, II, 1896, col. 2146ff—"Der Mittelraum des altitalischen Hauses, welcher ursprünglich den Herd enthielt, und als Speiseraum, Arbeitsraum der Frauen, überhaupt als gemeinsamer Aufenthalt der Hausgenossen diente"—became a commonplace in the subsequent encyclopedic literature. It reappears in Fiechter's article "Römisches Haus," in Pauly-Wissowa Real-Encyclopädie, 2nd ser., 1A:1, 1914, col. 983; in Wasmuth, I, 1929, 220; in Schmitt, I Stuttgart, 1937, col. 1197; in Encyclopedia Britannica, II, 1957, 654; and many others. A solitary exception is Antonio Sogliano's article "atrio," in Enciclopedia Italiana, V (Milan-Rome, 1930), 255-56, which summarizes the more recent views ("Il megaro e il tablino sono, rispettivamente, la vera casa di cui l'aulé e l'atrio non sono que il cortile") with bibliography concerning the discussion of this subject prior to 1930. This theory was taken up and widely propagated by one of the greatest connoisseurs of Roman house construction, August Mau.13 13 Mau's widely read and repeatedly reprinted account of Pompeian life and art, published in an English translation even before it appeared in German, is probably the primary reason for the tenacious survival in encyclopedic literature of the superannuated view related above. Cf. Mau, 1899, 247, and 1904, 253; and idem, 1900, 235-36, and 1908, 258. But, curiously enough, it had not originated from any archaeological evidence, which in fact seemed to contradict it, but from a questionable etymological speculation by certain Roman authors who believed that atrium came from ater ("black") and referred to the blackening of the atrium 266. PLAN OF ST. GALL. BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF A RECONSTRUCTION OF THE PLAN OF THE MONASTERY MADE FOR J. R. RAHN BY GEORG LASIUS (1876, fig. 12, 91) This is the first, and for its period, truly outstanding attempt to show in an accurately constructed bird's-eye view, what the monastery might have looked like had it actually been built. It formed the basis of the three-dimensional model reconstruction shown in figure 267. Rahn's interpretation of the guest and service buildings as covered basilican structures with central hearths and openings in the roofs above, serving as smoke escape and light inlet, was a great improvement over Keller's (fig. 264) and Lenoir's interpretation, but like theirs, suffers from being modeled after Classical prototypes rather than those historically and archaeologically related to those of the era and location of the Plan of St. Gall. 267. ST. GALL. HISTORICAL MUSEUM OF ST. GALL ARCHITECTURAL MODEL. A RECONSTRUCTION OF THE BUILDINGS OF THE PLAN The model was made by the sculptor Jules Leemann of Geneva, in 1877, on the basis of drawings furnished by Georg Lasius and has ever since been on display in the Historical Museum of the city of St. Gall. It is a masterpiece of its kind, built to scale, and executed with supreme craftsmanship. Length of base: 70¼ inches (1.78m). Width: 49½ inches (1.25m). The roofs of the houses, as well as the Church, can be lifted, exposing the furniture on the ground floor levels. The second stories, the Refectory and the Cellar can be lifted out in their entirety. The reconstruction of Church, Cloister, and Novitiate are essentially correct. The height of the Church (a little over twice the width of the nave) is excessive for the period. The reconstruction makes no distinction between masonry and timber. Entirely unconvincing is the design of the majority of the guest and service structures (see caption, figure 266). walls by the smoke from its hearth.14 14 The principal source is Servius' Commentaries on Vergil, ed. Thilo and Hagen, I, 1922, 202: atrium enim erat ex fumo. The derivation of atrium from ater is only one of several derivations current among Roman etymologists. Others thought that it came from an Etruscan town, Atria, where the style of building is supposed to have originated: "alii dicunt Atriam Etrurii civitatem fuisse, quae domos amplis vestibulis habebant, quae cum Romani imitarentur, `atria' appellaverant" (ibid.). In modern etymological literature the term has been connected with Greek ??????? or ????????? ("under the open sky"), which is more compatible with the available archaeological evidence, Thesaurus Linguae Latinae, II:1, 1901, col. 1101. But even if it could be demonstrated that ater is the correct root, we could not infer from this that in the early Roman house the hearth stood in the atrium, since as long as the open space of the atrium formed the principal means of escape for the smoke from the kitchen, the walls and timbers of the court would be blackened even if the kitchen were located in one of the peripheral chambers. A great deal of confusion in the discussion of the Roman atrium and its relation to the hearth has been created by a traditional misinterpretation of verses 302-3 in book VI of Ovid's Fasti: "at focus a flammis et quod fovet omnia, dictus; qui tamen in primis aedibus ante fuit." This passage can under no circumstances be evidence, as Ruge suggests (above, p. 12 n.6), for the assumption that the hearth stood in the center of the Roman atrium, and that the latter was in the earlier days the central hearth or living room of the house. The passage states, "The hearth (focus) is so named after the flames, and because it warms (fovet) everything; formerly it stood in the forward part of the house." What Ovid conveys with this sentence is that, in contradistinction to his own days when the hearth had no fixed position but could be found in any of the cubicles in the immediate vicinity of the dining room (tablinum), in the early Roman house the hearth lay always in the "forward part of the building"—a statement that would be in full accord with the views expressed by Sogliani, Patroni, and Boethius—if we were to assume that Ovid's verses referred to a time in which the roof of the main house had as yet not coalesced with that of the subsidiary structures into the complex organism of the Roman atrium house. Cf. Ovidius, ed. Bömer, I, 1957, 272; and Ovid's Fasti, ed. Frazer, 1951, 340. That the Roman atrium was at that time thought of as a courtyard and not as a room, is expressed with unequivocal clarity in Festus' definition of "atrium": "Atrium proprie est genus aedificii ante aedem continens aream, in qua collecta ex omni tecto pluvia descendit," i.e., "The atrium strictly speaking is that part of the building which lies in front of the dwelling, and contains in its center an area into which the rain waters fall which are collected by the entire roof." Sexti Pompei Festi De verborum significatu liber, ed. Wallace M. Lindsay (Leipzig, 1913), 12. Since the beginning of this century, this view has been increasingly challenged by a trend of thought that holds that, on the contrary, the Roman atrium was originally an open yard, which gradually developed into a covered court. The main exponents of this theory are Antonio Sogliano,15 15 Sogliano, 1937, 61ff, and op. cit. Giovanni Patroni,16 16 Patroni, 1941, 294ff. and Axel Boethius,17 17 Boethius, 1934. who believe the Roman atrium house to be the product of a gradual transformation of an early Italic farmstead, whose individual buildings had been scattered loosely around a central open yard, into an organized architectural system under the hands of the Etruscan conquerors. They assume that the principal building of this Italic farmyard was a prostyle farmhouse with hearth and bedstead. Through a gradual process of axial co-ordination of this main house with the subsidiary structures and the yard enclosure, the Etruscans, according to this theory, developed the irregular Italic farmstead into the aggregate depicted in figure 268. Two further developments, in their opinion, led from this hypothetical prototype form to the emergence of the classical Roman atrium house, the "Pompeian primehouse"; the coalescence, namely, of the roofs of the subsidiary structures with that of the main house on one hand, and the roofing-over of the courtyard on the other. As this process unfolds itself, the hearth is shifted from the original farmhouse (now tablinum) into one of the adjacent smaller rooms.18 18 The views of Axel Boethius (ibid.) differ slightly from those of Sogliano and Patroni. The primary stimulus for the development of the Roman atrium house, according to Boethius, came from the Orient, from a type of Near Eastern atrium house of which E. Gjerstad excavated an excellent specimen at Vouni, Cyprus (Gjerstad, II, 1932). It is from this type, according to Boethius, that the Etruscans drew the organizing idea that helped to crystallize the irregular Italic prime forms into an axially co-ordinated establishment and which, in particular, is responsible for the tripartite room partition at the head of the atrium, opposite the entrance (with the tablinum in the center). In essence this arrangement is identical with that of the Vouni palace, which had three cellae at the upper end of an open courtyard. Whatever the differences between Patroni's and Boethius' views may be, both hold—contrary to the traditional assumption—that the atrium is by origin an open court that was progressively roofed over, until it eventually took on the semblance of a room. If this assumption is correct —and it appears to command wider and wider assent—the rain catch basin of the Roman atrium house could no longer be considered to be developmentally the successor of the hearth site of its Italic antecedents. Whatever the merits of this theory may be, this much appears to be certain: we do not know of a single Roman atrium house, excavated or otherwise attested, that shows in the center of its covered court either the traces of a hearth19 19 Even Mau has to admit (1908, 259), "of a hearth in the atrium not a trace," and from this fact infers that the hearth must have been "banished from the atrium in a comparatively early date" (idem, 1899, 237; 1904, 254). Of an overwhelming number of excavated Roman atrium houses only two show traces of a hearth in the inner court of the house. In one of these the hearth is not part of the original structure (Nissen, 1877, 448); in the other it stood in one of the corners, not in the center of the court (ibid., 431). or any evidence in the roof above it for the existence of a protective lantern (testudo). In the Roman atrium house this spot is the traditional place for the catch basin (impluvium) and directly above it, in the roof, for a rainhole (compluvium), which also served as air or light source (fig. 265). The hearth lay, as a rule, in one of the smaller chambers to the side of the tablinum, or in one of the other peripheral cubicles, but in any case entirely outside the atrium space. The testudo of the Roman atrium house, then, is an altogether different architectural entity from the device that carries this name on the Plan of St. Gall. The latter device called testu on the Plan of St. Gall is coextensive with the hearth site (and could very well be interpreted, as Rahn suggested, as a protective shield or lantern that covers an opening in the roof above the hearth); the testudo of the Roman atrium house by contrast is the designation for a shielding roof which covers the Roman atrium, either as a peripheral shed (as in the atrium Tuscanum) or as a continuous roof (as in the smaller and rarer atrium testudinatum). The ash-urn house of Poggio Gaiella The same objections have to be raised with regard to Schlosser's comparison of the St. Gall house with an Etruscan ash urn from Poggio Gaiella (fig. 269) and other imitations 268. ARCHAIC ETRUSCO-ROMAN HOUSE. RECONSTRUCTION REDRAWN FROM PATRONI, 1941, 294 Patroni's ideal conception shows the form that the early Italic farmstead had attained after individual buildings, formerly scattered loosely around an open yard, were axially aligned into an organized architectural scheme by the Etruscan conquerors of the Italian peninsula about the 12th century B.C. The peak of Etruscan culture was achieved during the 6th century B.C. of the displuviate atrium as they are found in the architecture of some Etruscan tombs. All of these specimens belong to the courtyard type. They have an opening at the very spot where the St. Gall house calls for a protective cover, and there is no suggestion whatsoever that their hearths lay under this opening or had any functional or developmental relation to this opening. If the St. Gall house were reconstructed analogous to the house from Poggio Gaiella, it would have its hearth on the very spot where every squall of rain or sleet would kill the fire and drench the occupants of the adjacent benches and tables. As well as it may have been adapted to the temperate conditions of a southern climate, the layout of the house from Poggio Gaiella would hardly meet the housing requirements of a climate where heavy downpours and freezing temperatures are matters of course for periods of considerable duration. FRANZ OELMANN, 1923-1924 A shaky premise Whatever the merits of Schlosser's theories might have been—and even if he had been correct in his assumption that the Etruscan and Roman atrium houses that he discussed were of truly basilican type—a problem of major magnitude was still presented by the formidable gap— chronological, topographical, and cultural—that separated Rahn's St. Gall house from its presumptive Etruscan and Early Roman prototypes. To bridge this gap Franz Oelmann, in 1923/24, attempted to demonstrate that houses of the Poggio Gaiella type (fig. 269) were common in Roman imperial times and continued to be in use in the provincial territories of Germany and Gaul even after they had been conquered by the Franks.20 20 Oelmann, 1923/24; and idem, 1928. The second article does not deal with the Plan of St. Gall as such but reiterates the impluviumhearth controversy (127ff). A faulty interpretation of the Gallo-Roman courtyard house Oelmann subscribed to Rahn's idea about the St. Gall house and felt convinced that Schlosser was right in defining it as a descendant of the Etruscan urn house of Poggio Gaiella, which both he and Schlosser, however, interpreted wrongly as a structure of basilican type. Oelmann conceded that the city of Pompeii, with all its wealth of architectural information, "does not furnish any convincing parallels,"21 21 Oelmann, 1923/24, 204. then added, "but in the secular architecture, not so much of Italy as of the Gallo-Germanic provinces of the North, we can find analogies for practically each and every subvariety of the houses of the Plan of St. Gall."22 22 Ibid., 211. He undertook to support this assertion by assembling the plans of a considerable number of Gallo-Roman houses and juxtaposing them, type by type, with what he believed to be their constructional counterparts on the Plan of St. Gall. In establishing these parallels, he adopted a procedure, as unorthodox as it is startling, by simply reversing the views of the archaeologists by whom these houses had been excavated. The latter were convinced that what they had unearthed were the foundations of typical Roman courtyard houses, i.e., houses in which the rooms were ranged peripherally around an open central court as in the Roman atrium house. In two of them, a farmhouse in the vicinity of the village of Nendeln, Liechtenstein (fig. 270),23 23 For the farmhouse in Nendeln, cf. Oelmann, 1928, 127. The original excavation report (Jenny, 1897, 121ff) was not available to me. and a Roman villa in Bilsdorf, Luxembourg (fig. 271),24 24 Malget, 1909. Malget's interpretation of this house as a courtyard house was accepted by Swoboda, 1924, 112, but again rejected by Oelmann, 1928, 127. they had found the remains of a large impluvium, tangible evidence of the correctness of this interpretation. Oelmann did not conceal these facts,25 25 Although he does not reveal them in each and every instance. Cases in which he fails to bring to the reader's attention the fact that his interpretation is in conflict with the views of the excavator are: 1) the Roman villa near Darenth (Kent) in England, interpreted by its excavator as belonging to a house with an open inner court (cf. Fox, 1905, 220); 2) a villa in Hagenschiessenwalde near Pforzheim (fig. 11A), also interpreted by its excavator as a house with an open inner court (cf. Naeher, 1885, 80); and 3) one of the service structures (No. 58) of the great Roman villa at Anthée, Belgium (cf. Marmol, 1881, 7). There may be more. I could not check all of Oelmann's references, since some of the journals to which they refer are not available in the United States. but simply brushed them aside with the contention that what the excavators declared to be an inner court was in reality a covered hall, and that the rectangular basins found in the center of these structures had to be interpreted not as catch basins—as the excavators thought—but as hearths! It is difficult for me to see how an experienced excavator would confuse the straight and careful lining of a Roman impluvium that had never been exposed to fire with the scorched and blackened remains of a hearth whose rims were never as regularly set; but what makes Oelmann's categorical reversal of the thinking of his predecessors even more perplexing is the fact that in one case at least, namely that of the villa at Bilsdorf in Luxembourg, the excavator had unearthed not only the remains of the catch basin itself, but also a good portion of its drainage ditch. In his account of the villa of Bilsdorf, Oelmann is guilty both of factual distortion and of suppression of vital archaeological evidence. He does not tell us that from the presence of heat ducts found in the walls of chambers A and J (fig. 272) the excavators had concluded that at least the avant-corps of the villa must have been a double-storied structure. He leaves us in ignorance about the fact that, while many of the peripheral rooms were carefully paved with tiles (Rooms B, C, and F) or opus signinum (Rooms A, M, L, K, and J), the floor of the court consisted of nothing but stamped clay. And least to be excused, he furnishes us with a plan 269. ETRUSCAN ASH URN. POGGIO GAIELLA [after Oelmann, 1923/24, 215, fig. 5] By von Schlosser and Oelmann misinterpreted as a structure of basilican elevation, this house type instead had its rooms ranged peripherally around an open inner court that was partially roofed over like the Roman atrium house shown in figure 265. 271. BILSDORF, LUXEMBOURG [after Oelmann, 1928, 127] 270. NENDELN, LIECHTENSTEIN [after Oelmann, 1928, 127] Oelmann's rendering of the villa at Bilsdorf is a highly simplified version of the very detailed and exemplary plan published in 1910 by its excavators, E. and R. Malget (fig. 272). It suppresses information (given in our caption to figs. 272-273) that makes incontrovertible the fact that the inner part of the house was an open court surrounded by a covered walk, with a center opening (IMPLUVIUM) beneath which rain collected in a catch basin (COMPLUVIUM). Thus Oelmann's interpretation of this villa as a house of basilican design is untenable. The Bilsdorf villa was destroyed by fire, possibly set by invading Franks, toward the end of the 3rd century A.D. A welter of skeletal remains suggests the house burned in the course of a violent battle. Both Bilsdorf and Nendeln are typical Roman standard houses with living quarters ranging around an open inner court, of the type commonplace throughout the length and breadth of the Roman empire. For the original excavation report on Nendeln see S. Jenny, Mitteilungen der K.K. Central Commission, XXIII, 1897, 121ff. (fig. 271) that wholly suppresses26 26 Figure 271 is Oelmann's rendering of the plan of the villa at Bilsdorf, as reproduced in Oelmann, 1928, 127. all of the four heating units (two furnaces, one hypocaust, and one brazier) that the excavator found in the peripheral chambers (Rooms A, C, F, and J) and carefully recorded in his own original plan (fig. 272). All this evidence taken into account suggests precisely what its excavator thought it to suggest—namely, that the villa of Bilsdorf was a classical example of the tetrastyle Roman atrium house, i.e., a house in which a peripheral suite of rooms, ranged all around a central open court, was surrounded by a covered walk that had a large rectangular opening in the middle of the roof through which the rain drained off into a central basin in the floor beneath it. The rooms could be heated by classical Roman heating devices (hypocaust, furnaces, brazier), either in pairs or individually. In the tetrastyle Roman atrium house, Vitruvius tells us, the roof of the surrounding gallery of the court "was supported at the angles by columns."27 27 "Tetrastyla sunt, quae subiectis sub trabibus angularibus columnis et utilitatem trabibus et firmitatem praestant, quod neque ipsae magnum impetum coguntur habere neque ab interprensivis onerantur" (Vitruvii De Architectura Libri Decem, op. cit., 129). "In the tetrastyle the girders are supported at the angles by columns, an arrangement which relieves and strengthens the girders; for thus they have themselves no great span to support, and they are not loaded down by the crossbeams" (Vitruvius, The Ten Books on Architecture, tr. Morris Hicky Morgan [Cambridge, 1926], 176). In the villa of Bilsdorf all of the base blocks of these posts were found still in their original emplacement. In its vertical elevation, then, the villa of Bilsdorf bore not the slightest resemblance to Rahn's St. Gall house, but rather might be imagined to have looked like the house shown in figure 273.28 28 My own suggested reconstruction. The type is very old; cf. The Villa of Good Fortune at Olynthos, Robinson and Graham, 1938, frontispiece. What I have tried to demonstrate with regard to the villa of Bilsdorf holds true for all of Oelmann's other comparisons. In not a single case could he actually demonstrate on the basis of controllable evidence that his houses looked as he claimed them to look; and in whatever cases I have been able to check, his own interpretation of the facts either contradicted that of the men by whom these houses had been excavated or were open to at least one other explanation. In claiming that Oelmann's attempt to trace the missing Gallo-Roman prototypes of Rahn's St. Gall house was a failure, I do not mean to imply that houses of the type that Oelmann had in mind might not have existed. But as long as the proof of their existence rests on authoritative assertion rather than on archaeological demonstration, I cannot see how such a house type could be used as a prototype form for the reconstruction of the guest and service structures of the Plan of St. Gall. A faulty interpretation of "testu" While Oelmann agreed with Rahn's interpretation of the St. Gall house as a structure of basilican type, he took exception to the latter's explanation of the testu[do] square as a lantern surmounting a smoke hole in the roof above the fireplace. Such a device, he claims, is attested to neither by classical nor by medieval house construction. He suggests, instead, that what the drafter of the Plan of St. Gall had in mind is more likely to have been a huge freestanding chimney stack on pillars or arches, which rose from the ground to the ridge of the roof, protruding through the latter, and ejected its smoke into the open air (fig. 274).29 29 Oelmann, 1923/24, 208ff. But here again the reader is not furnished with any corroborating historical evidence. That Rahn's testudines have no equivalents in classical Greek and Roman architecture may well be the case, but the assertion that they are not attested to in the Middle Ages is easily contested.30 30 For a detailed discussion of this evidence, cf. below, p. 117ff. And as far as Oelmann's own suggestion is concerned, it must be pointed out that all the presumptive medieval parallels that he adduces turn out upon inspection to pertain not to houses but to kitchens.31 31 Oelmann, 1923/24, 208 note 3; kitchen of the Cistercian monastery of Villers, Brabant (cf. Clemen-Gurlitt, 1916, plan, fig. 102, description, 112). Oelmann's references to Durham Abbey, Durham Castle, and Raby Castle (Archaeological Journal, LXV, 1908, 312, 322, and 328) are so vague that it is hard to determine what he has in mind, but from the opening words of the sentence that follows, "Über Kloster küchen im Allgemeinen," etc., it is clear that it is the kitchens of these structures to which he refers. The reader will recall that the squares on the Plan of St. Gall which are alternately designated as locus foci and as testu[do] are by no means confined to the houses for distinguished persons. They are an integral part of even the humblest among the stables. It is difficult to imagine that an extremely tall and costly masonry stack such as Oelmann had in mind should have adorned the houses of swineherds, shepherds, and goatherds at a period when such devices were a novel rarity even in the dwellings of the nobles. Most perplexing of all, however, is Oelmann's identification of the term testu[do] with "chimney stack"—an equation that finds no support on any grounds—since it is neither possible to demonstrate that the term was ever used in this sense in classical or medieval Latin, nor reasonable to presume that it might ever have been used in this manner. Its basic meanings (protective shield, covering lid, tortoise, turtle shell32 32 Cf. above p. 5, and below p. 117ff. ) are in outright conflict with the idea of a hollow flue or duct which underlies the concept of a smokestack. V.1.2 THE NORTHERN SCHOOL All the theories heretofore reviewed have in common the fact that they attempted to explain the guest and service structures of the Plan of St. Gall in the light of house types presumed to have existed in Etruscan, Roman, and Gallo-Roman times. The most ardent exponent of this school, Franz Oelmann, expressed himself in no uncertain terms when he summarized his views with the phrase, "The Plan of St. Gall, then, must be derived in its entirety from the Classical tradition, i.e., from Roman architecture, and of Northern influences . . . there can be no question whatsoever."33 33 Oelmann, 1923/24, 210. The uncompromising fervor of this assertion is clear evidence that at the time these lines were written, the issue had already entered a highly controversial phase. And indeed, as early as the last two decades of the nineteenth century, the views of the classicists had begun to be progressively challenged by the speculation of an opposing school that proposed to reconstruct the guest and service structures of the Plan of St. Gall in the light of northern rather than classical building traditions. The seeds of this theory may actually be discovered in the writings of some of the exponents of the classical school. When Rahn, in 1876, interpreted the testu[do] squares as symbols for a lantern-surmounted opening in the roof above the hearth, he breached the thinking of the classicists, since this was a solution suggested by analogy with northern rather than with southern building types. Yet, apart from this "intrusive" detail, Rahn's reconstruction was essentially a product of the classical school. A square attack on the theories of the latter, however, was launched in 1882 by Rudolf Henning. RUDOLF HENNING, 1882 In a study entitled "Das Deutsche Haus in seiner historischen Entwickelung,"34 34 Henning, 1882, 150 fig. 62. Rudolf Henning stressed the resemblance of the plan of the St. Gall house to certain house types still used in Upper Germany and in Switzerland, in territories once occupied by Frankish, Alamannic, and Bajuvarian tribes. In dwellings of this type (fig. 275) such as is exemplified by a house from the Engadin in Switzerland, the hearth is, as a rule, located in a common center room (Eren) from which access is gained to all the subsidiary outer rooms. It is surmounted by a wooden smoke flue of pyramidal shape which projects beyond the roof like a chimney and can be closed and opened by an adjustable lid. A similar arrangement is found even today in old farmhouses of Denmark (fig. 276). Henning did not propose that the St. Gall house was equipped with such a smoke flue. He believed, on the contrary, that it had an open hearth and, in the roof above the hearth, a lantern-surmounted opening that served as a smoke outlet and as a light source. He imagined the St. Gall house to have been a spacious, steep-roofed structure with inner wall partitions that did not obstruct the view of its enclosing walls and rafters. He felt supported in this assumption by a passage in the Lex Alamannorum which makes the paternal right of inheritance dependent on the ability of the newborn child to encompass the roof and the four corners of the house as he opens his eyes.35 35 The passage is quoted in full below, p. 27 note 9. The existence of a house of this description, Henning felt, must be postulated as the medieval prototype form of the modern Swiss and Upper BILSDORF (HAUTE SURE), LUXEMBOURG. PLAN OF A ROMAN VILLA 272.A 272.B [redrawn after Malget, 1909, 354] Malget describes features of the villa's rooms: A. Heatable room with brick-column supported, raised floor of limestone-bedded, crushed rubble. Within it: socle for an altar (a); brick-paved area for the brazier probably used to heat the room (m); tile smoke flues (d). B. Room with limestone-bedded crushed rubble floor. C. Tile-paved room with hypocaust, heated by furnace (e). D. Room with crushed brick floor. E. Lodging for slaves (floor material not identified). F. Room paved with rectangular brick. G. Unpaved room, probably for slaves assigned to heat F. H. Room paved with stamped clay; I, room paved with stamped clay, probably, for slaves heating J. J. Warming room over hypocaust heated by furnace in I, with raised floor (unidentified substance) supported on brick columns. German farmhouses with central hearth and central accessibility of the subsidiary outer rooms; and, in the houses of the Plan of St. Gall, he believed to have discovered the first pictorial evidence of this prototype form. The development that leads from this archetype to its modern derivative, Henning assumed, was characterized by the gradual substitution of a stone-built stove with smoke flue for the originally open fireplace, and by the removal of the light source from the ridge of the roof to the walls, which became necessary when the opening in the ridge was obstructed by the installation of a central smoke stack. The beginnings of this displacement of the open fireplace by stone-built stoves, Henning suggested, may already be observed in some of the more distinguished structures of the Plan of St. Gall, such as the House for Distinguished Guests, where the common central fireplace is already supplemented by stone-built corner fireplaces. KARL GUSTAV STEPHANI, 1902-1903, AND CHRISTIAN RANCK, 1907 Henning refrained from embodying his ideas about the St. Gall house in a visual form, and in the fifty years that followed, this theory found neither support nor acceptance. The views expressed in Karl Gustav Stephani's encyclopedic work on the early German dwelling and its furnishings,36 36 Stephani, 1902-3. as well as those in Christian Ranck's percursory but widely read cultural history of the German farmhouse,37 37 Ranck, 1907, 23ff. are literal repetitions of Julius von Schlosser and show that 273.

Entrance hall with concrete floor of limestone, broken brick, and sand on a dry-stone bed. N.

Figure 273: Of square plan but for the generous setback of the entrance wing, the villa's size (over 80 × 80 feet on the ground floor) and its double-storied corner wings made it a structure of imposing presence. The reconstruction above is based on Malget's description, which holds a wealth of specific detail. the work of even those who specialized in the history of the German house was still entirely under the spell of the thinking of the classicist. But in the third decade of this century, the method that Henning had initiated, namely, that of attempting to reconstruct the St. Gall house in the light of its modern derivatives rather than of its historical prototypes, found a sudden revival in a number of visual reconstructions that marked a complete departure from the thinking of the classical school. These reconstructions (figs. 277-281) came from the hands of men who were not primarily historians but professional architects, and they were the product of intuitive speculation rather than of documentative historical study. The first of these was made by H. Fiechter-Zollikofer in 1936. H. FIECHTER-ZOLLIKOFER, 1936 Mr. Fiechter-Zollikofer, a Swiss engineer, wrote an article entitled "Etwas vom St. Galler Klosterplan aus der Zeit um 820," which was published in the Schweizerische Technische Zeitschrift,38 38 Fiechter-Zollikofer, 1936. a journal not normally read by the architectural historian of the Middle Ages. In this article Fiechter-Zollikofer reproduced not only an over-all reconstruction of the entire monastery shown on the Plan of St. Gall, in bird's-eye view (fig. 277), but also a separate reconstruction of the exterior of the Outer School (fig. 278), the PLAN OF ST. GALL. OUTER SCHOOL. INTERPRETATION OF OELMANN (1923-4). AUTHORS' DRAWING 274.C WITH ROOFS Like Rahn (see figs. 266-267) Oelmann interprets the St. Gall house as a structure of basilican elevation with a large central hall rising above the roofs of the perpheral rooms and receiving its light through windows in the clerestory walls. 274.B WITHOUT ROOFS AND WALLS PARTLY REMOVED In contrast to Rahn (figs. 266-267) Oelmann interprets the squares, which on the Plan are alternatingly referred to as TESTU (i.e. lantern) and LOCUS FOCI (i.e. hearth) as freestanding chimneys rising all the way up to and through the ridge of the house. This interpretation of TESTU is philologically not convincing. 274.A WITHOUT ROOFS, AND FULL HEIGHT WALLS The real weakness of Oelmann's interpretation lies in its bases on purely theoretical considerations, giving no heed to the vernacular building tradition of the north (not well understood and known in Oelmann's days) which offers better and more convincing parallels for the interpretation of the guest and service buildings of the Plan (see below, pp. 88ff). Until challenged by student who felt that the guest and service buildings of the Plan should be interpreted in light of the vernacular building tradition of the north, this interpretation prevailed. But its proponents could not prove that houses of this type existed in Carolingian times. exterior of the Abbot's House (fig. 254), as well as a number of perspectives and cuts of the church and the claustral structures. Fiechter-Zollikofer was convinced that the traditional concept of the St. Gall house as a dwelling that received its light in the Italian manner through windows in its clerestory walls was incompatible with the climatical conditions prevailing in transalpine Europe, and that a solution infinitely better adapted to the rain and snowswept foothills of the Alps could be found if the St. Gall house were reconstructed in the light of certain rural timber dwellings still used in many districts of Switzerland. Accordingly, he reconstructs the St. Gall house as a low-roofed, low-walled gable house of logs with corner-timbered protruding beams (fig. 278). The center room of this house receives its light through a large tapering shaft mounted upon the ridge of the roof which could be opened and closed through an adjustable lid (fig. 279); the outer rooms were lighted through windows in the peripheral log walls. Fiechter-Zollikofer's reconstruction is the first attempt to interpret the guest and service structures of the Plan of St. Gall in the light of an actually existing vernacular house type. It is a handsome reconstruction, but the prototype after which it is modeled, the Alpine log house, is too closely associated with local conditions to have been adopted in a master plan that was drawn up for the whole of the Frankish empire. Log construction depends on abundant stands of fir trees, such as are available in the Alps, the Black Forest, and the mountain ranges of Scandinavia; but in the lowlands this material was lacking. Moreover, Fiechter-Zollikofer did not enter into any detailed analysis of the internal layout of these houses. He did not support his reconstructions with any specific parallels with comparable structures still in existence, or attempt to trace this house type to its historical past. OTTO VÖLCKERS, 1937 Fiechter-Zollikofer's article had barely been published when the German architect, Otto Völckers, touched upon the problem of the St. Gall house in a small, handsomely illustrated book in which he reviewed the history of the European house from the Stone Age to the present.39 39 Völckers, 1st ed., 1937, 34; 2nd ed., 1949, 34. Völckers exemplified his views with a reconstruction of St. Gall's House for Distinguished Guests (fig. 280). This he imagines to have been a steep-roofed structure, hipped-over on the narrow ends of the building. The walls are low and masonry-built with windows giving light to the external rooms. The center room is lighted by an opening in the ridge above the hearth site, which also serves as a smoke outlet and is surmounted by a small protective roof that shields the opening against any downpour. The heating units in the bedrooms of the distinguished guests are interpreted as corner fireplaces with masonry stacks protruding through the roof above them. Völckers did not discuss 275.

BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF THE MONASTERY RECONSTRUCTION BY FIECHTER-ZOLLIKOFER [1936, 405, fig. 2] A great advance over the reconstructions offered by the classicists (figs. 266, 267 and 274) and the first attempt to interpret the guest and service structures of the Plan of St. Gall in the light of an existing building tradition—wholly workable in structural terms, yet too dependent on local alpine conditions (log construction) to be applicable to a document worked out in the heart of the Frankish Empire and conceived to reflect more general conditions. the structure in any further detail, but judging from an interior view of the dining room (fig. 281) which he published in a subsequent book,40 40 Völckers, 1949, 18. he appears to think of the inner wall partitions as likewise being built as solid masonry walls. KARL GRUBER, 1937 The same year that Völckers published his pictorial review of the history of the German house, and probably independent of both Völckers' and Fiechter-Zollikofer's proposal, Karl Gruber published still another reconstruction of the Plan, in bird's-eye view, in a superbly illustrated book, entitled Die Gestalt der deutschen Stadt (fig. 282).41 41 Karl Gruber, 1937, 25, fig. 15; 1952, 25, fig. 15. Like Fiechter-Zollikofer, Gruber reconstructs the St. Gall house as a house with low pitched roof and straight gable walls on the narrow sides. It receives its light from windows in the supporting walls and emits the smoke of its hearth through a louver in the ridge of the roof. The latter, as in Völckers' reconstruction, is rendered as a miniature roof, raised above the level of the main roof to protect the opening over the hearth site. Gruber is not specific about the material used in the construction of his houses. The uniform mode of the rendering of the walls suggests that he thought of them as being built in masonry. V.1.3 A RENASCENCE OF THE CLASSICAL SCHOOL ALAN SORRELL, 1966 The interpretations of Fiechter-Zollikofer (1936), Völckers (1937), and Gruber (1937) represented a radical departure 278. PLAN OF ST. GALL. OUTER SCHOOL [Interpretation by Fiechter-Zollikofer, 1936, 407, fig. 6] The St. Gall house is here reconstructed as a low-roofed, low-walled gable house, of log construction, the center room receiving its light through a tapering wooden shaft mounted upon the ridge of the roof (see fig. 279). from the views of the classicists by discarding all reference to Roman or Gallo-Roman house construction. In 1965 this trend was reversed by a dramatic reconstruction painting published in a beautifully illustrated book, The Dark Ages, under the general editorship of a distinguished Byzantinist, David Talbot Rice.42 42 Rice (ed.), 1965, 279-80. The painting (fig. 283) carries the signature of Alan Sorrell and is executed in the flamboyant chiaroscuro that characterizes the hand of this great interpretive draftsman to whom we owe so many other impressive reconstructions of medieval and Anglo-Roman buildings now in ruin. Unluckily, the scholarship that accompanied this drawing is not commensurate with the skill of its draftsmanship. The Church with its steep proportions and its elaborate blind relief of pilasters and arches looks more like a Romanesque cathedral than a Carolingian monastery SMOKE OUTLET AT RIDGE OF ROOF [Redrawn from Fiechter-Zollikofer, 1936, 406, fig. 5] 279.A 279.B Detail of the tapered wooden shaft that serves as light inlet and smoke escape in the houses shown in the two preceding figures. The lid that covers the opening can be opened and closed with the aid of chains. church. The design of the houses for the animals and their keepers which occupy the tract to the west of the Church, conversely, is a return to the superannuated concept of the courtyard house, proposed by Keller in 1844 and by Lenoir in 1852. The majority of the guest and service structures are rendered as buildings of basilican design, in conformity with the views expressed by Rahn in 1876, Schlosser in 1889, and Oelmann in 1923-4. Sorrell was obviously not familiar with any of the reconstruction drawings published by the opposing school (Fiechter-Zollikofer, Völckers, and Gruber), nor for that matter with a reconstruction of my own published by Poeschel in 1957 and by myself in 1958.43 43 Poeschel, 1957; Horn, 1958, 9, fig. 18. 280. PLAN OF ST. GALL. EXTERIOR PERSPECTIVE HOUSE FOR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS [as interpreted by Völckers, 1949, 34] Völkers reconstructs the St. Gall house—correctly in our opinion—as a steep-roofed structure hipped at the narrow ends, its center room lighted by an opening in the ridge that is surmounted by a small protective roof. 281. PLAN OF ST. GALL. INTERIOR PERSPECTIVE HOUSE FOR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS [as interpreted by Völckers, 1949, 18] The large center hearth on the Plan is termed "locus foci." Along the walls are tables and benches where visitors and their servants take meals. The rooms under the hipped portions of the roof are heated by their own fireplaces. His reconstruction gives the impression of being based on the description of the Plan published in 1848 by Robert Willis, who recognized that Keller's interpretation of the St. Gall house as a courtyard house conflicted with the inscriptions of the Plan, but did not relinquish this interpretation in the case of houses for animals and their keepers. V.1.4 SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Thus, by the sixth decade of this century the discussion of the guest and service structures of the Plan of St. Gall still remains stalemated by two opposing schools. The classicists had tried to explain the St. Gall house in the light of a presumptive Roman or Romano-Etruscan type of house that antedated the Plan of St. Gall by over a millennium, and whose existence they could not really prove. On the other hand, the house types on which the reconstructions of the opposing school were based reached no further back than the sixteenth, or at best, the end of the fifteenth century. The proponents of neither of these two contending approaches were able to demonstrate that the type of building they had in mind was actually in use at the time the Plan was drawn. And the great cultural alternative that Henning had raised in 1882—the suggestion that the guest and service structures of the Plan of St. Gall should be interpreted in the light of northern building tradition rather than in the light of classical Roman architecture—still loomed as an unsolved problem over the entire controversy. Oelmann had summarized this condition correctly in 1923-4, by stating, "The entire quibble about the Northern-Germanic or Southern-Roman derivation will only be decided once the existence of layouts that correspond exactly can be proven in either one or the other area."44 44 Oelmann, 1923-4, 210. However, he added to this statement a passage of questionable validity when he amplified it with the remark, "The North is totally excluded, for neither are any contemporary house remains preserved which would be worthy of mention, nor is it possible to infer from later specimens earlier forms of an identical type." Doubtful in 1923-4, Oelmann's latter idea had become untenable by 1971 (when this chapter was written). It is true that at the time of Oelmann's writing research into the problem of the Northern house was still in its infancy. Nevertheless, some significant discoveries about transalpine house construction in the Middle Ages had already been made in Sweden and on the islands of Gotland and Iceland.45 45 I refer to such excavations as had been conducted in Sweden as early as 1886 by Frederik Nordin ("Gotlands s.k. Kämpagrafvar," in Mânadsblad, Kungl. vítterhets ok antîkvîtets akademíen [Stockholm, 1886], 145ff; 1888, 49ff; and idem, En svensk Bondgârd for 1500 âr sedan [Visby, 1891]); in Iceland as early as 1895 (cf. Thorsteinn Erlingsson, Ruins of the Saga Time [London, 1899]); and during the first two decades of this century in such places as Augerum in Blekinge, Sweden (cf. Otto Montelius, Kulturgeschichte Schwedens [Leipzig, 1906], 283, fig. 451); and Rings in Hejnum, Sweden (on the latter, cf. Vallhagar, ed. Stenberger and Klindt-Jensen, II, 1955, 864ff). To be sure these were few and scattered; 282. PLAN OF ST. GALL. BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF THE MONASTERY RECONSTRUCTION BY KARL GRUBER (1937, 25, fig. 15) This handsome reconstruction was published in the same year that Otto Völckers published his reconstruction of the St. Gall house (figs. 280-81). In structural terms Gruber's concept is as workable as that of Völckers and Fiechter-Zollikofer (figs. 277-278), but the conjecture that the guest and service buildings would all have been constructed in masonry in a part of the world where houses were by tradition built in timber (see pp. 23ff) is unconvincing. Very interesting and historically defensible, but not supported by the Plan itself (see I, 163ff) is Gruber's conjecture of a tower over the intersection of nave and transept. Abbot Haito's church at Reichenau (I, fig. 117) and the abbey church of St. Riquier (I, fig. 196) had such towers. 283. PLAN OF ST. GALL. BIRD'S-EYE VIEW OF THE MONASTERY RECONSTRUCTION. PERSPECTIVE BY ALAN SORRELL (Rice, 1965, 279-280) The design of the houses for animals and their keepers (foreground) is based on the superannuated concept of the courtyard house, proposed by Keller in 1844 (fig. 264). Most of the other houses are interpreted as basilican structures, in conformity with suggestions made by Rahn in 1876 (fig. 266), Schlosser in 1889, and Oelmann in 1923-24 (fig. 274). Sorrell was not familiar with the writing and reconstructions of scholars who interpreted the St. Gall house in the light of northern building traditions (fig. 277, 278, 280). but the numerical lack of strong, convincing archaeological material was made good to a considerable extent by the availability of a substantial body of literary and textual references to house construction which had been touched upon as early as 1882 by Rudolf Henning46 46 Cf. above, p. 13 note 34. and was discussed at length in 1902-3 by Karl Gustav Stephani's comprehensive treatise on the German dwelling.47 47 Cf. above, p. 15 note 36. During the last three decades this material has been enriched by a veritable flood of archaeological discoveries bearing upon the problem. As I propose to deal with this material at length in a separate study, I shall review it here only to the extent necessary for the typological identification of the guest and service structures of the Plan. V. 2 PREHISTORIC, PROTOHISTORIC &amp; EARLY MEDIEVAL PROTOTYPES OF GUEST &amp; SERVICE BUILDINGS OF THE PLAN OF ST. GALL V.2.1 LITERARY EVIDENCE THE NORTH GERMANIC HOUSE OF THE SAGA PERIOD In 1889 the Icelandic literary historian and philogist Valtyr Gudmundsson1 1 Gudmundsson, 1889. A brief popular summary of the results of this work was published by the same author in Rosenberg, 1894, 251-74. I am confining myself here to the briefest summary of Gudmundsson's findings. Anyone interested in particulars will find his way to the original sources by checking the Old Norse terms, here given in parentheses after their modern English equivalent, against the Old Norse subject index at the end of Gudmundsson's book (258-66). was able to demonstrate, on the basis of a careful and painstaking analysis of words and passages in the Nordic Sagas referring to the layout and construction of houses, that the Germanic standard house of the Saga Period (ninth to thirteenth centuries) in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Iceland was a three-aisled timber structure with an open fireplace (eldr, "fire" or arinn, "hearth") in the middle of its center aisle (golf); that this house received its light through an opening in the roof (ljóri, "light inlet"), which also served as a smoke outlet (hence also referred to as reykháfr or reykberi, "smoke hole,") and which could be closed and opened by means of ropes or poles; that the roof (ráf or ræfr) of this house was supported by a free-standing inner frame of timber, composed of two longitudinal rows of uprights (súlur, stafir, sto?ir, stolpar, and sometimes more specifically referred to as innstafir or innstolpar, "inner posts," in contradistinction to the útstafir, the corresponding "outer" or "wall posts"), which were connected lengthwise by means of roof plates (ásar or langvidir, "long beams") and crosswise by means of tie beams (vagl, vaglbiti or þvertrè, "crosstree"). Gudmundsson summarized his findings visually in a plan and a perspective view of the interior of the Saga house, drawn up for him by E. Rondahl (figs. 284 A-B).2 2 Not included in Gudmundsson's original study, but first published in Rosenberg, op. cit., 257, fig. 10, and 260, fig. 11. He demonstrated that this house type could be used for a variety of purposes, without changing any of its basic dispositions. It served, as circumstances demanded, as a general living house (stofa or stufa), as a dining or festal hall (drykkjuskáli, veizluskáli), as kitchen or fire house (elda skáli), as sleeping hall (skáli or hviluskáli), even, as a hay or cattle barn (hla?a or fjóshla?a). In the early days— and subsequently in the lower social strata—all these functions were performed simultaneously under one roof; later, as increasing wealth and social prestige permitted, they were progressively relegated to separate buildings. Gudmundsson could establish that in the general living house as well as in the festal or banqueting hall the floors of the aisles (langpallar) and of the cross bay at the upper end of the house were, in general, raised above the level of the center floor and covered with wooden planks. Long benches (langbekkir) and tables (bor?) were set up in the aisles parallel to the two long walls of the house and also crosswise along the gable wall at the rear of the house. This raised section at the innermost part of the house was referred to as the crossbench (þverpallr). The chieftain or owner of the house sat on his high seat (œdra öndvegi, "first seat of honor") in the middle of one of the two long benches (i mi?ju bekk) while his principal guest of honor occupied the second best high seat (úœdra öndvegi) in the middle of the opposite bench. The women sat on the crossbench at the rear of the house. The fire crackled in the middle of the center floor. The entrance lay, in general, in the center of one of the two gable sides of the house, and was often separated from the rest of the house by an entrance hall (forstofa, forskáli) which occupied the foremost bay of the house, forming a counterpart to the women's cross bench at the opposite gable. Often this entrance bay was separated from the main space by a cross partition (þverpili), which had in its center a second or inner door. The walls of the Saga house (veggir, or, more specifically, langveggir, "long wall," and gaflveggir, "gable walls") were, as a rule, constructed of earth or turf (torfi), and insulated inside with a wooden paneling (veggþili). The rafters rose from wall plates (syllr or staflægjur) and converged at the top in a ridge beam (mœniáss) which was carried by short king posts (dvergr, "dwarf post") rising from the center of the tie beams. From numerous incidental references to the house, made in the dramatic accounts of battles waged when a householder and his family were attacked in their sleep and forced to rise to defend themselves, Gudmundsson could infer that the sleeping house (skáli) was divided lengthwise, like the stofa, into a center aisle and two lateral aisles and received its warmth from an open fire that burned in the middle of the center floor. As in the stofa, the floors of the lateral aisles were raised above the level of the center aisle and covered with wooden planks. But instead of supporting tables, the aisle floors of the skáli (called set) were covered with a bedding of straw and subdivided crosswise into individual sleeping compartments by means of rugs or "hangings" (sængarklæ?i) suspended from cross beams. Each compartment was sufficiently large to accommodate two people (sengefeller, "bedfellows") lying parallel to the walls of the building, one outside (fyrir ofan) or near 284.A THE NORTH GERMANIC HOUSE OF THE SAGA PERIOD, 9TH-13TH CENTURIES [after Rosenberg, 1894, 257, fig. 9] The house is entered through one of its gable walls. Its center floor (a,a) is made of stamped clay; b,b,b are open fireplaces framed by stones. The aisles are slightly raised (c,c) and covered with wooden boards. They accommodate the benches and tables for the men (f,g). The terminal bay, with the benches and tables for the women (e.g) is treated in the same manner; h is a table from which food and drinks are served; i,i are footstools in front of the high seats; j is a secret door for escape through an underground channel should the principal entrance be blocked by enemies. The walls are built in a mixture of earth, rubble and turves. the wall paneling (vid þili), the other inside (fyrir framan) or near the sleeper beam (vid stokk, i.e., the floor beam that forms the edge of the slightly raised level of the aisles). The bedsteads of the master and his wife were often separated from the adjoining bedsteads by means of a wooden wall partition, so as to form a bed closet (rekkja) that could be locked and was then called a lokhvílu (lockable closet). One or two further closets of this type were frequently installed for persons next in rank or for guests of honor. In like manner the aisles of the cattle barns were subdivided into individual cross compartments for the stabling of the livestock. As one reviews this evidence one cannot fail to be struck by the amazing similarity of the North-Germanic Saga house, spatially and functionally, with that of the guest and service structures of the Plan of St. Gall. Both have as nucleus an open center space accessible to all, which gives admittance to a peripheral suite of outer spaces surrounding the center space on three or all four sides. In both, the hearth lies in the middle of the center space and has in the roof above it a shielded opening that serves as a smoke outlet. In both this layout is used, either separately or combined, without requiring the slightest alterations of its basic dispositions, as shelter for the people, as shelter for their livestock, and as shelter for the harvest. There are, to be sure, some distinctive differences. The Saga house has its entrance, in general, in the middle of one of its gable walls; that of the St. Gall House is, in the majority of cases, in the middle of one of its long walls. Yet three of the St. Gall houses belong to the former type.3 3 The House of the Fowlkeepers, the House of the Physicians, and the large anonymous building to the left of the road leading to the monastery entrance are all accessible through an entrance that is located on one of the narrow ends of the building. Another difference is to be found in the fact that in such buildings as the House for Distinguished Guests and the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers, the tables and benches are ranged around the periphery of the center space (figs. 392 and 396). In the Saga house they are set up in the aisles and on the cross bench. Only on extraordinary occasions, namely, when the throng of visitors was so great that they could not all be accommodated in the aisles and on the cross bench, were special rows of chairs set up in the nave of the hall. A typical case in point is the fateful wedding banquet given in the winter of 1253 in Gizur Thorvaldsson's home at Flugumyr (figs. 328A-B). The number of guests attending this party amounted to well over a hundred men (á œdra hundradi). Since Gizur's dining hall was only 26 ells long and 12 ells broad (stofan var sex álna ok tottugu löng, en tólf alna brei?), the host gave orders that in addition to all the seats that could be placed in the aisles (the seating capacity of the aisles and of the cross bench had already been doubled by the setting up of an outer row of forechairs), two further rows of stools should be set up in the center aisle. The latter were borrowed from the church. "And lengthwise all along the two benches there were forechairs and all along the center aisle church stools were set up on which people sat in two rows."4 4 "Forsaeti vóru fyrir endilöngum bekk hvaramtveggja. Kirkjustólar vóru settir eptir midju gólfinu, ok par var seti? at tveimmegin." The account of this banquest is to be found in Sturlunga Saga (ed. Vigfusson, II, 157ff; and in the German translation of Baetke, 1930, 301ff; see also Baetke's chronological table, 354). Also see below, p. 80, caption to fig. 328. Finally, the outer spaces of the St. Gall house appear to have been more rigidly separated from the center space than was the case in the house of the Sagas. But of this there will be more to say in a later chapter. 284.B THE NORTH GERMANIC HOUSE OF THE SAGA PERIOD, 9TH-13TH CENTURIES PERSPECTIVE VIEW OF INTERIOR, MADE FOR V. GUDMUNDSSON by E. RONDAHL [after Rosenberg, 1894, 257, fig. 10] The hall was warmed by a fire burning in the middle of the center floor. An opening in the roof above the hearth served as smoke escape and admitted light and air to the interior. In the aisles on either side of the fire: to the left the high seat of the owner, to the right the seat for his most distinguished guest. Between them: the high seat pillars, part of the roof-supporting frame of timbers, but decoratively carved and sacred to the gods. THE EARLY MEDIEVAL HOUSE IN THE TERRITORY OF THE ALAMANNI, THE BAJUVARIANS, AND THE FRANKS, IN THE LIGHT OF CONTEMPORARY LEGAL CODES Gudmundsson's findings are restricted to the Germanic territories of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland,5 5 Gudmundsson's contribution to the architectural history of the Middle Ages is extraordinary. In assessing its significance one can only express regret at the limited effect his findings have had upon the study of medieval house construction. The reasons for this are several. First, perhaps, is the fact that house research has never been a primary interest of the architectural historian of the Middle Ages. Second, the fact that Gudmundsson's work, which was well known, of course, to philologists and literary historians, was available to architectural historians only through German summaries (I refer to such works as Dietrichson-Munthe, 1893; and Stephani, I, 1902, 361ff). These lacked Gudmundsson's own compendious apparatus of references to the originals and therefore left the reader unable to judge the methods by which these results were obtained. Third, and even more important, there is no denying that even for one who is tolerably well acquainted with the Nordic Sagas, Gudmundsson's book is extremely difficult to absorb. It is spiked with thousands of references, whose relevance can only be judged in their original context. The Sagas do not contain at any one place a full and systematic description of their heroes' dwellings. This picture rather has to be pieced together from parts that are scattered throughout a vast array of different sources, and it becomes alive and convincing only as the fragments grow together into a coherent whole. Until very recently few of these sources had been translated into modern languages. Many of them, even today, are available only in their Old Norse editions. A proper evaluation of Gudmundsson's methods, for this reason, requires not only a considerable fluency in the Old Norse language, but also an extremely bulky apparatus of early editions. and cannot, of course, be automatically applied to continental THE NORTH GERMAN HOUSE OF THE SAGA PERIOD, 9th-13th CENT. 285.B EXTERIOR VIEW 285.A INTERIOR VIEW [author's interpretation modified from Walter Schultz] These sketches attempt to render the appearance of a typical house of the Saga Period and to demonstrate in particular that the house received its air and light not through windows in the walls (which would have made the dwelling too vulnerable to hostile intrusion) but through an opening in the roof, which also served as smoke escape and was itself surmounted by a small roof raised slightly above the level of the main roof. The walls were built of turves and often even the roof itself was covered with them (cf. fig. 292), blending house and landscape in a continuous carpeting of grass. Europe where conditions may have been more complex. Fortunately the information that Gudmundsson could extract from the Sagas can be supplemented by some extremely informative Continental sources. Significant documentary evidence concerning house construction in the territory of the Alamanni, the Bajuvarians, and the Franks is scattered through a number of early medieval legal codes that regulate, among other matters, the compensation to be adjudged for damage wrought upon a dwelling and its sundry appendages.6 6 The material that follows was written before the publication of Dölling, 1958. I am pleased to find that there is no need to modify any of my findings in the light of Miss Dölling's valuable study, which deals with a considerably wider range of sources than are here adduced. LEX ALAMANNORUM The earliest document of this nature is the so-called Lex Alamannorum, an Alamannic code of law laid down between 716 and 719 by an assembly of thirty-four dukes, thirty-three bishops, and sixty-five counts, under the presidency of Duke Lantfrid I (d. 730).7 7 The latest edition of the Lex Alamannorum, including a German translation, is K. A. Eckhardt, 1934. For previous editions and literature concerning date and origin of the Lex Alamannorum, see the article "Germanic Law" by Christian Pfitzer and K. A. Eckhardt in Encyclopedia Britannica, X, 1941, 211. Article 82 of this code, which fixes the compensation for arson, bears out what Tacitus had stated some seven centuries earlier about the loosely scattered character of Germanic settlements. This article establishes the following sanctions:8 8 1. Si quis aliquem foco in noctem miserit, ut domum eius incendat seu et sala sua et inventus et probatus fuerit, omnia qui ibidem arsit, similem restituat et super haec XL solidos conponat. 2. Si enim domus infra curte incenderit aut scuria aut granica vel cellario, omnia simile restituat et cum XII solidis conponat. 3. Si quis stuba, ovilem, porcaricia domum alequis concremaverit, unicuique cum III solidis conponat et similem restituat. 4. Servi domo si incenderit, cum XII solidis conponat et similem restituat. 5. Scura servi si incenderit, cum VI solidis conponat et similem restituat. 6. Si enim spicaria servi incenderit, cum III solidis conponat [et si domino, cum VI et similem restituat] (Eckhardt, 1934, 58-59). If at night a man sets somebody's house (domus) or hall (sala) on fire and is caught and found guilty, he is bound not only to restore whatever he has destroyed by fire but, in addition, to pay a fine of 40 shillings. If he lays fire to any other houses in the yard (in curte), viz., the barn (scuria or granica) or the storehouse (cellarium), he must likewise compensate for the inflicted damage and settle with an additional fine of 21 shillings. Fines are specified in the same manner for damage and destruction to all the other service structures, the bathhouse (stuba), the sheepfold (ovilis), and the pigsty (porcaricia), as well as the houses and barns for the serfs (servi domus, scura servi, spicaria servi). From this it follows that the Alamannic farmstead of the beginning of the eighth century consisted of a group of separate buildings in a common yard (curtis); its principal structures were the house (domus) and the hall (sala). Whether domus and sala are synonymous or indicate a separation of the principal unit into a living house (domus) and an eating hall (sala) remains uncertain. From another passage in the same Lex Alamannorum we gather incidentally some insight into the inner architectural layout of such a dwelling. Article 94 states that if a mother dies in childbirth, leaving a child who expires after having lived for one hour and opened his eyes during this time so that he could see the ridge (culmen) and the four walls (iv parietes) of the house, the maternal inheritance will fall to the father.9 9 1. Si quis mulier qui hereditatem suam paternicam habet post nuptum et prignans peperit puerum et ipsa in ipsa ora mortua fuerit et infans vivus remanserit tantum spacium vel unius horae possit operire oculos et videre culmen domus et IV parietes, et postea defunctus fuerit, hereditas materna ad patrem eius perteneat. Tamen si testes habet pater eius qui vidissent illum infantem oculos aperire et potuisset culmen videre et IV parietes, tunc pater eius habeat licenciam cum lege defendere; cui est propriaetas, ipse conquirat (Eckhardt, 1934, 66-67). This stipulation presupposes a building open to the roof with internal subdivisions, whatever they might have been, that did not obstruct the simultaneous visibility, from the mother's bedstead, of the four walls of the house and of the ridge of its roof.10 10 This fact was stressed as early as 1882 by Rudolf Henning (1882, 147). LEX BAJUVARIORUM Information of a considerably more specific nature can be obtained from the Lex Bajuvariorum. This code of law, which is slightly later than the Alamannic Law, on which it draws in part, was compiled between 740 and 748 at a time when the territory of the Bajuvarians was already under the firm control of the Franks.11 11 The latest edition, together with German translation, is Eckhardt, 1934, 130-35. Article 10 deals with arson and the compensation imposed for the destruction of buildings or their component structural parts by fire or any other means.

Si autem ignem posuerit in domum, ita ut flamma eructuat, et non perarserit et a familiis liberata fuerit, unumquemque de liberis cum sua hrevavunti conponat, eo quod illos inunwan, quod dicunt, in disperationem vitae fecerit, et non conponat amplius nisi tantum quantum ignis consumpserit. Ducalis vero disciplina integer permaneat. Et si negare voluerit de istis, cum campione se defendat aut cum XII sacramentales iuret. De servorum vero firstfalli uniuscuiusque ut manus recisa conponat. 5.

HOUSE OF THE LEX BAJUVARIORUM 8th CENTURY RECONSTRUCTION BY KARL GUSTAV STEPHANI [I, 1902, 326; redrawn] Stephani correctly interpreted WINCHILSUL ("columna angularis") and "caterae columnae huius ordinis" as, respectively, cornerpost (A-A) and posts standing in the walls connecting them (B-B). Not mentioned in the text and therefore purely arbitrary are entrances to porch and main house (D, E), hearth (F), and porch itself (L-L). The "columna a qua culmen sustentatur quam firstsul vocant" Stephani correctly interpreted as ridge post (C), but incorrectly presumed that it referred to a single massive timber erected in the center of the living space. He also overlooked the reference in the text to an inner order of posts ("ordo interioris aedificii"). The scale of Stephani's plan as it is drawn seems illogical. Evidence from site excavations supports the contention that a ridge post such as he postulates could not have been larger than ca. 18″ × 18″. This dimension, applied to his drawing as a scale indicator, would make his proposed living space about 14 feet square, or drastically less than that needed to accommodate a Bajuvarian freeman's family and servants. As a diagram, the plan is wholly deceptive with little of constructive value. ARTICLE 10 On arson and the compensation payable therefor.13 13 Professor Stefan Riesenfeld in the School of Law, University of California, Berkeley, has had the kindness to check this translation for correctness of its legal terminology. 1. If someone sets fire at night to somebody's property, and ignites the house of a free man (or of a serf) he is bound, first of all, to pay a fine according to the rank of the person and make restitution for all of the buildings; and whatever he sets on fire there, furnishings and equipment, he will have to restore. And with all free men who have escaped from said fire without their clothes on, he will have to settle according to their wound money; in the case of women, however, this will have to be doubled. Moreover, for the roof of the house, he will have to settle with a fine of 40 shillings. 2. And in the case of the barn14 14 scoria. Other Old High German versions are: scura, sciura, or schiure; New High German: Scheuer; French: écurie; cf. Heyse, II, 1849, 667. of a free man, if it is enclosed with walls and provided with a lockable bar, he will have to settle for the roof with a fine of 12 shillings; if, however, it is unenclosed, what the Bajuvarians call a scof,15 15 scof. Other Old High German versions are: scopf, schopf; Middle High German: shopf and schopfe; New High German: Schopfen, i.e., a "weather roof"; cf. Grimm, IX, 1899, col. 153. i.e., a shed without any walls, he will have to settle with a fine of 6 shillings. In the case of such a granary, however, as they call a parc,16 16 parc. Other Old High German versions are: pharrich, pherrich; Middle and New High German: pferch; from Middle Latin parcus, an enclosure or shed either for animals, or for the storage of grain or hay; cf. Grimm, VII, 1889, col. 1673. he will have to settle with a fine of 4 shillings. But in the case of a mita,17 17 mita: from Latin meta; Low German: mite; Dutch: mijte; New High German: Miete; all in the sense of a haystack or stack of sheaves protected by a conical roof of thatch which rested on poles and could be lowered and raised according to need; cf. Grimm, VI, 1885, col. 2177. A typical example of this type of structure can be seen in the background of the picture of Ruth and Boas in the Dutch Bible of about 1465, reproduced in fig. 368. if he un-roofs it or sets it on fire, he will have to settle with a fine of 3 shillings. But in the case of a smaller one, which they call a scopar,18 18 scopar. Other Old High German versions are sopar, sober; New High German: Schober; a stack of hay, straw, or grain sheaves piled in the open field; cf. Heyse, II, 1849, 775. he will have to settle with a payment of 1 shilling. And everything he will have to restore in like. 3. In the case of smaller buildings, if someone devastates them, or tears their roofs down, as often happens, or surrenders them to fire, which they call firstfalli,19 19 first: identical with New High German First; Middle High German virst or fuerst; Anglo-Saxon fierst, first; cf. Grimm, III, 1862, cols. 1677-78. he will have to settle for every one which is separately built, such as a bathhouse, a bakehouse, a kitchen house, or any other structure of this sort, with a fine of 3 shillings and will have to restore whatever is destroyed or burned down. 4. However, if he sets fire to a house so that it bursts into flame yet the house does not burn down and is saved by the members of the household, he will have to settle the wound money for each of the free people, because he inunwan20 20 The verb inunwan does not occur in any of the Old High German dictionaries and glossaries that are available to me, and Eckhardt leaves it untranslated. However, from the explanatory apposition that follows (in disperationem vitae fecerit), one would suspect it to be equivalent with "exposed them to the danger of losing life and limb." them, as they say, i.e., put them in fear of their life, and beyond that he will not have to make any further compensations in excess of that which has been consumed by the fire. The fines forfeited to the duke, however, remain unaffected. And if he wishes to contest any of these he will have to defend himself with a champion or must take an oath supported by 12 oath helpers. As far as the serfs are concerned the destruction of a house (firstfalli) will have to be settled in like manner as the cutting off of a hand. 5. And now, since we deem our ruling on the burning of buildings completed, it is not inappropriate that we explore in greater detail the fines imposed upon the destruction of the living quarters of a household. 6. If someone with criminal or any other intent, through arrogance or hostility, through negligence or a certain lack of understanding, tears down the roof of a free man, he will have to settle with a fine of 40 shillings. 7. If [he tears down] that post by which the ridge is held in place and which they call firstsul ("ridge post"), he will have to settle with a fine of 12 shillings. 8. If he tears down in the interior of the building that post which they call winchilsul ("corner post"),21 21 winchil: identical with New High German Winkel, "angle" or "corner"; cf. Steinmeyer and Sievers, III, 1895, 128, No. 63 (Angulus winchel, winkil). he will have to settle with a fine of 6 shillings. 9. For the other posts of this order, however, he will have to settle with a fine of 3 shillings. 10. But for the corner posts of the outer order he will have to settle with a fine of 3 shillings. 11. For all the other posts of this order he will have to settle, for each individually, with 1 shilling. 12. For the tie beams,22 22 trabes: in classical as well as in Medieval Latin this term is used for the horizontal cross and long beams, which frame the principal uprights together, i.e., "tie beams," and the "plates." however, he will have to settle each with a fine of 3 shillings. 13. For the outer beams, however, which we call spanga23 23 spanga: identical with New High German Spange, a "clamp," here used in the specific sense of "wall plate," the horizontal beams that frame the wall posts together. [literally, "clamp"] because they hold together the order of the walls, he will have to settle with a fine of 3 shillings. 14. For everything else, however, that is the boards,24 24 asseres. Since we are obviously not dealing here with primary structural members, asseres cannot be used here in the sense of "post" or "pole," but is more likely to stand for "board" or "lath," and may refer to either the covering material of the walls or the grill of laths on the roof into which the shingles are keyed. the shingles,25 25 laterculus: in classical Latin "a small brick"; in Medieval Latin, however, also used for "shingle," as follows from a passage quoted by Du Cange: "Turris laterculis ligneis cooperta, id est, scandulis" (V, 1938, 35). and the bracing-struts,26 26 axis: in classical Latin "axle tree"; but also "board" or "plank." Since in its primary sense this term appears to denote a connecting piece of timber, I should be inclined to assume that it may be used here for the smaller subsidiary "struts," which stiffen the main frame of the building, or for the "collar beams," which brace the rafters. or whatever else is used in the construction of a building, he will have to settle with 1 shilling each. And if a person has inflicted all of this damage to the building of another person, he shall not be compelled to pay more than what is due for the destruction of the roof and whatever crimes he has committed greater than this. Minor infractions of this person are not to be prosecuted with the exception of those for which restitution has to be made according to law. * The article then goes on to define the compensation set for damage to the yard, the braided wattle enclosures, the pastures, roads, and pathways. Of all surviving literary sources on early medieval architecture this article of the Lex Bajuvariorum offers the fullest and most detailed information on the nature of contemporary domestic building. In the first place it confirms what had already been demonstrated by the Lex Alamannorum, namely, the fact that the West Germanic farmhouse of the eighth century consisted of an aggregate of separate structures, which included a living house (domus), a bathhouse (balnearius), a bakehouse (pistoria), and a kitchen house (coquina), plus an entire group of agricultural service structures, such as the various barns and stables (scoria, granarium quod parc appellant, etc.). But more importantly, in paragraphs 6-14 we are furnished with an item by item account of the component members of the roof-supporting frame of timber. Their functions are defined by their names, listed often both in Latin and in their vernacular Old High German form; and their varying size and structural importance are reflected in the weight of the fine that is placed upon their damage or destruction. Listed in the sequence of their constructional importance they are: 1. Culmen or first: the "ridge" or "ridge beam" to which the head of the rafters is fastened. Its demolition entails the collapse of the entire roof; hence, the largest fine is set for its destruction (40 shillings). In the Lex Bajuvariorum the term is alternatingly used in the specific sense of "ridge" or "ridge pole" or as pars pro toto for the entire roof of the house. 2. Firstsul: "the post by which the ridge is carried" (eam columnam a qua culmen sustentatur). The structural importance of this column finds recognition in the fact that the fine imposed upon its demolition is set at 12 shillings, almost a third of the fine imposed for the destruction of the whole house. HOUSE OF THE LEX BAJUVARIORUM. 8TH CENTURY 287.B 287.A 287.D 287.C RECONSTRUCTION BY OTTO GRUBER (1926, 24, fig. 13) The principal characteristic of the house type on which Gruber modeled his reconstruction of the Bajuvarian standard house is that its roof is supported by three parallel rows of posts, the center row carrying a ridge beam, the outer rows roof plates or purlins. Gruber calls this a "ground floor house for man and livestock" (ebenerdiges Wohnstallhaus). The earliest extant examples date from the end of the 15th century. They are found on both the Swiss and German sides of Lake Constance, the Aargau, the Kanton of Bern in the southern parts of the Black Forest, and less frequently in the Saar river basin and the Eifel Mountains. In late and post-medieval times the interior of this house was divided, in accordance with the transverse alignment of its posts, into a series of compartments used for hay or harvest storage (Schopf), usually under a hipped portion of the roof; for livestock (Stall); as central access area to other compartments (Tenne) and in winter also for wagon storage; as kitchen (Küch); and as a withdrawal area often subdivided by an axial wall into two private rooms (Stuben), under the roof at the end of the house opposite the Schopf. In general structural organization this house may well derive from that of the Lex Bajuvariorum, but whether the latter may have been divided into compartments cannot be decided on textual evidence. (For extant examples see O. Gruber, 1926, and a posthumous study by him, Bauernhäuser am Bodensee, edited by K. Gruber, Lindau and Konstanz, 1961.) 3. Winchilsul: this member is explicitly said to stand in the interior of the building (interioris aedificii). It is part of a columnar order whose individual posts (assessed at 3 shillings) rate only half of its own value (6 shillings). The context leaves no doubt that winchilsul was the Old High German designation for the four corner posts of the freestanding inner frame of timbers which carried the roof plates and separated the house internally into a center space and a peripheral suite of aisles. The corner posts were obviously of a heavier make than "the remaining posts of this order" (ceterae huius ordinis), since they were rated twice their value. But rising only midway up to the roof, they rate in turn only half the value of the ridge-supporting firstsul. 4. Columna angularis exterioris ordinis: "the corner column of the outer order of posts." Its penal value amounts to 3 shillings, in contradistinction to the "other members of this order" (aliae columnae huius ordinis) which are assessed at 1 shilling each. The relative value assessed to all of these members suggests that the outer wall posts had only half the strength of the posts of the inner frame. 5. Trabes: the horizontal long and cross pieces ("tie beams" and "roof plates"), which frame the principal uprights together. The relation of paragraph 12 to paragraph 13 leaves no doubt that trabes is used as a generic designation for all those horizontal timbers which connect the uprights lengthwise and crosswise. Paragraph 12 deals with the trabes of the inner order, i.e., the "tie beams" and "roof plates" which connect the principal inner posts that separate the nave from the aisles of the hall. Their penal value (3 shillings) is identical with that of the supports on which they rest, save for the heavier corner posts (winchilsul) which rate twice that value. Paragraph 13 deals with the trabes of the outer order (exterioris vero) and refers to them with the Old High German designation: 6. Spanga, "clamp," so-called "because they hold the walls together." The fine assessed for the destruction of these timbers, in modern architectural terminology referred to as "wall plates," is identical with that of the corresponding pieces of the inner order (3 shillings). 7. Asseres, laterculi, and axes, the "rafters," the "shingles," and the "bracing struts". Their penal value is 1 shilling each. We are not the first, of course, to try our hand at a reconstruction of the Bajuvarian standard house based on this meticulous enumeration of its component structural members. A first attempt of this kind, consisting of a plan only, was made in 1902 by Karl Gustav Stephani (fig. 286);27 27 Stephani, I, 1902, 326ff. Stephani was influenced by Henning, op. cit., 171. a second, consisting of a plan and various sections and elevations, in 1926 by Otto Gruber (fig. 287);28 28 Gruber, 1926, 24ff. and a third, in the form of an isometric perspective, in 1951 by Torsten Gebhard (fig. 288).29 29 Gebhard, 1951. Stephani's interpretation (fig. 286) of the house as a one-room structure with a porch on one of its narrow ends misses the basic message of the text, which makes a clear distinction between an "inner" and an "outer order of posts" and within each of these between their "regular members" and their "corner posts." This suggests a house that is composed of a center space and a peripheral belt of outer spaces. Even more untenable is Stephani's explanation of firstsul as a ridge-supporting center post. I presume that it was the fact that this term is used in the singular which induced Stephani to interpret the passage to mean that the ridge of the Bajuvarian house was supported by a single post that stood in the very center of the building. Such an arrangement is constructively incongruous and must be refuted on both linguistic and architectural grounds. Linguistically, one finds, the singular form appears again in the very next paragraph, and there it refers to a structural member (winchilsul, "corner post") which by definition cannot have possibly existed in a singular form, since a house with one corner post would be a logical absurdity. Constructionally, a ridge beam may be supported by a center post, but a center post alone could not possibly hold it in place; its stability required additional supports at each end of the beam. It must have been Stephani's faulty exegesis of the text that induced Dehio to remark with regard to the Lex Bajuvariorum that "the attempt to reconstruct the Bajuvarian standard house is unconvincing."30 30 Dehio, Die Geschichte . . . , 1930, 22. The criticism is fully justified when applied to Stephani, but it would be wrong if it implied, as the context suggests, that the source did not lend itself to a convincing reconstruction. Gruber's reconstruction (fig. 287) comes considerably closer to the truth; but his internal subdivision of the house into areas used as stables, barns, and living quarters are derived from post-medieval house forms (Old Upper Suebian farmhouse and Hotzen house) and are, therefore, purely conjectural. Decidedly wrong in Gruber's reconstruction is the application of the term winchilsul to all the members of the "inner order" (designated with the Arabic figure 2 in his plan), because the text distinguishes clearly between the "corner posts" (winchilsul) and the "other columns of this order" (ceterae vero huius ordinis). By far the most convincing of all the existing reconstructions is that of Thorsten Gebhard (fig. 288). As a point of minor criticism it might be noted that there is nothing in the Lex Bajuvariorum which would suggest that the center space was boarded off against the outer space by the solid wooden paneling shown in Gebhard's reconstruction; while, conversely, this reconstruction fails to show a feature that is explicitly mentioned in the text, namely, the "remaining posts of the inner order" (ceterae huius ordinis [columnae]). Gebhard is probably right when he assumes that the Bajuvarian standard house had its principal entrance in the middle of one of its long sides, but again HOUSE OF THE LEX BAJUVARIORUM 288. AXONOMETRIC VIEW 8TH CENTURY [reconstruction by Thorsten Gebhard, 1951, 234, fig. 3] In overall appearance this reconstruction of the house of the Lex Bajuvariorum is fairly convincing. But like Stephani, Gebhard fails to account for the inner order of posts ("columnae interioris aedificii") which, the text states, stood between the cornerposts (winchilsul). The horizontal timbers connecting the heads of these posts could not have carried the roof load over very wide spans without additional posting as described in the text; unsupported, they would surely have sagged or broken. The same holds true for the ridge purlin. Nor is there any indication in the text that the center space of the house was separated from the peripheral spaces by a solid wall partition, as Gebhard shows. * The orientation of the large group of buildings at Zwenkau-Harth (fig. 288.X.a) is conspicuous in the treatment to be found in Quitta, 1958, and was possibly to gain advantageous solar exposure, or protection from the wind. ZWENKAU-HARTH NEAR LEIPZIG, GERMANY 288.X.b SECTION 3RD MILLENNIUM B.C. [after Quitta, Neue Ausgrabungen in Deutchland, 1958, 69 and 75] Houses divided lengthwise into four aisles by three axial rows of posts, carrying ridge beam and purlins, were among main characteristics of the architecture of the Banded Pottery People (Bandkeramiker) who introduced agriculture and animal husbandry into Central Europe between 50003000 B.C., and who, owing to their sedentary life of seeding and harvesting, became the first European village builders. A distinctive construction feature of their houses is the transverse alignment of the roof-supporting posts that divide the house crosswise internally into a sequence of compartments—a trait perplexingly similar to the partitioning of the late and post-medieval houses studied by Gruber (fig. 287). The house of the Lex Bajuvariorum, as well as its late medieval derivatives, may have its first roots in this Neolithic house tradition, but the precise manner in which these concepts might have been transmitted over three milennia is not known. (For possible Bronze and Iron Age links, see fig. 289.A) this is a purely conjectural feature. In my reconstruction (fig. 289) I have limited myself to showing only those members which are explicitly mentioned in the Lex. The Lex does not tell us anything about the position of the hearth, but the location of the hearth is not in question. In structures of this type the hearth was always in the middle, or somewhere else along the axis of the center space, at maximal distance from the incendiary timbers of the walls and the roof. Dehio, then, greatly underrated the importance of the Lex Bajuvariorum for the history of early medieval house construction. This code not only lends itself to a structural reconstruction of the Bajuvarian standard house, but it does so with singular explicitness, and from the information thus obtained we can draw general conclusions that are of importance for the broader issues of our study. Foremost among these is the recognition that during the eighth century a European house type existed with a general design that closely resembled the North Germanic house of the Saga period. Like the latter, it is a skeletal timber structure and is covered by a large pitched roof, whose rafters converge in a ridge pole. There are some distinctive differences, to be sure. In the Saga house, as has been pointed out, the ridge pole was carried by short king posts (dvergr) that rose from the center of the cross beams. In the house of the Bajuvarians the ridge was supported by posts that rose from the ground. The Saga house was three-aisled like the Germanic all-purpose house discussed below, pp. 45ff. The house of the Lex Bajuvariorum is four aisled, bearing striking, yet so far inexplicable, resemblance to a house type common in Central Europe in the 3rd millenium B.C. (see caption, 288X). CAROLINGIAN CROWN ESTATES AND THEIR HOUSES, IN THE LIGHT OF CONTEMPORARY ADMINISTRATIVE ORDINANCES AND PROPERTY DESCRIPTIONS In contradistinction to the Alammanic and Bajuvarian law, the law of the Franks (Lex Salica)31 31 The latest edition, with German translation, is Eckhardt, 1953, 12-119; for further information on this code of laws, see Dölling, 1958, 6-15. is a disappointingly unrewarding source of architectural information. It does not include a special chapter on arson, nor does it otherwise define the fines imposed upon the demolition of the whole or any part of the Frankish house. But this deficiency is compensated for, to some extent, by the survival of two administrative ordinances of the Frankish court which give us some insight into the architectural layout of a royal crown estate, the Capitulare de villis and the so-called Brevium exempla. CAPITULARE DE VILLIS The Capitulare de villis,32 32 The best edition of the Capitulare de villis, with excellent commentary to the Latin terminology, is that of Karl Gareis, 1895. A complete translation of the capitulary into French will be found in the earlier edition by Guérard, 1853. The most penetrating commentary on the date and territorial application of the Capitulare will be found in Bloch, 1926; Verhein, 1954, and 1955; and Metz, "Das Problem . . . ," 1954, and 1960, passim. an ordinance formerly assumed to have been drawn up in 794 or 795 by the young Louis the Pious in order to correct certain abuses that had arisen in the administration of the royal estates of Aquitania, is now believed to have been issued by Charlemagne shortly before 800 as a directive to the entire empire (except Italy) in part to curtail mismanagement, in part to set a program for the future. Among the seventy-odd articles of which it is comprised, there are some that refer to architecture. They read like a description of some of the guest and service structures of the Plan of St. Gall, and exhibit with vivid distinctness the basic similarity of the architectural layout of a secular and a monastic Carolingian manor. In fact, being laid down for the specific purpose of defining what buildings are considered to be indispensable components of a royal estate, they form literary counterparts to the agricultural service structures of the Plan of St. Gall. While providing us with a comprehensive picture of the diversity of buildings associated with Carolingian crown estates, they unfortunately do not tell us anything about their design or construction. I am extracting from these articles whatever appears to have a bearing on architecture, without regard to the order in which this material appears in the original. Article 27 prescribes: "At all times our houses [casae nostrae] shall be provided with fireplaces and fire[?]guards [foca et wactas habeant] so that they do not suffer any damage."33 33 Gareis, 1895, 40-41. I wonder whether foca et wactas might refer to hooded and chimney-surmounted corner fireplaces of the kind found in the bedrooms of the House for Distinguished Guests on the Plan of St. Gall, as well as in the Abbott's House and the withdrawing rooms of most of the high-ranking monastic officials; cf. below, p. 123ff. Article 42 specifies the household equipment of the royal supply room (camera). It stipulates that it be provided at all times with its full complement of bedding, tableware, cutlery, cooking equipment, and all other kind of utensils, so that one will never be in need of sending for them or borrowing them from outside. It contains nothing further that would shed any light on the layout of the royal mansion itself.34 34 Ibid., 47-48. Article 41 provides, "that the buildings in our estates [intra curtes nostras], and the surrounding fences [sepes] be well guarded and that the stables [stabulae], the kitchens [coquinae], the bakehouse [pistrina], and the presses [torcularia] be planned with care, so that our men [ministeriales nostri] can perform their functions properly and with cleanliness."35 35 Ibid., 47. 289.A HOUSE OF THE LEX BAJUVARIORUM. 8TH CENTURY PERSPECTIVE WITH ROOFING REMOVED, SHOWING STRUCTURAL SCHEME AUTHOR'S INTERPRETATION The relative severity of the penalties imposed by the Lex Bajuvariorum to compensate a householder for willful damage done to his dwelling (see fig. 289.B) is clearly related to the size and structural importance of the particular timber involved. The preoccupation of the text with penalties for "pulling down" house timbers presumes that in general the overall framework of the typical house was sufficiently light, and its key timbers sufficiently accessible, to make this mode of revenge an attractive nuisance. Timbered early medieval houses with a central row of posts supporting the ridge parlins have, since this chapter was written, appeared in excavations in Manching and Kirchheim, near Munich (see Schubert, Germania, L (1972), 110ff, and Dannheimer, IBID., L1 (1973), 168ff. For sporadic Bronze and Iron Age antecedents see Zippelius, 1953, 19, fig. 2; Reinerth, I, 1940, 16, fig. 4b; Pl. 6 opposite p. 26; 28, fig. 7; 139, figs. 60-62; 198, fig. 85.) I am not aware of the existence of any Central European Bronze and Iron Age houses with three parallel rows of roof-supporting posts. The connection of the house of the Lex Bajuvariorum with those of the Banded Pottery People suggested in fig. 289.X must therefore be treated with caution. In West and North Germanic territory, houses with a row of center posts for carrying ridge purlins are a great rarity.

STRUCTURAL MEMBERS IDENTIFIED, WITH FINES LEVIED TO COMPENSATE DAMAGE AUTHOR'S INTERPRETATION Article 23 prescribes: "Our superintendents shall see to it that each of our estates be provided with its dairy [vaccaritia], its piggery [porcaritia], its facilities for raising sheep [berbicaritia], its facilities for raising goats [capraritias], and its facilities for raising billy goats [hircaritias]; and of all this they shall have as much as they can handle; and none of our estates shall be without these installations."36 36 Ibid., 38-39. Article 46 prescribes, "that the enclosures for animals commonly referred to as brogli lucos nostros, quos vulgus brogilos vocat be well guarded, and always kept in good repair, and that one should not wait until it is necessary to rebuild them anew; and the same applies to all of the buildings."37 37 Ibid., 50. Article 50 prescribes, that each superintendent determine the number of chickens that should be kept in each stable (stabulo) and the number of caretakers to be stationed with them. (In Article 19 it had already been established "that not less than 100 chickens and 30 geese shall be kept in the barns of our main estates [ad scuras nostras in villis capitaneis] and not less than 50 chickens and 12 chickens and 12 geese in our outlying settlements [ad mansioles].")38 38 Ibid., 51-52. Article 45 prescribes, "that each of our superintendents see to it that he have skillful craftsmen [artifices] in his district [in suo ministerio], that is: blacksmiths [fabros ferrarios], goldsmiths [aurifices], silversmiths [argentarios], shoemakers [sutores], lathe workers [tornatores], carpenters [carpentarios], shieldmakers [scutarios], fishermen [piscatores], KÄNNE (STAVGARD), PARISH OF BURS, GOTLAND, SWEDEN GERMANIC LONGHOUSE, 3RD-5TH CENTURY PLAN [after Stenberger, II, 1955, iii, fig. 357] The house was built in two stages. Its northern half (the original dwelling) had a floor of stamped clay. The inner walls were lined with heavy granite boulders. The roof was covered with turves that fell into the house as its supporting timber frame collapsed, smothering the fire that destroyed it. The floor of the southern half of the house was paved with fine gravel. Its roof was of lighter construction and its walls less solidly built than the northern half.

BREVIUM EXEMPLA The Brevium exempla ad describendas res ecclesiasticas et fiscules consist of three specimen descriptions of property, more or less fiscal in character, and were presumably drawn up for the guidance of the royal agents who assessed the produce of the domain.40 40 Best edition is that of A. Boretius, in Mon. Germ. Hist., Leg. II, Capit. I, 1883, 250-56. For date, location and purpose, cf. Grierson, 1939; Metz, "Die Entstehung . . . ," 1954; and Verhein, 1954. The first description is of the possessions of the see of Augsburg on an island in Staffelsee in Bavaria, the second is part of a register of the possessions of the Abbey of Weissenburg in Alsace, and the third is the survey of five royal fiscs directly belonging to the crown. Two of these are listed by name, viz., the estates of Asnapium (Anappes in France, dép. Nord, arr. Lille, cant. Lannoy), and the estate of Treola (no longer identifiable, probably in Alamannia); three others are left anonymous (perhaps the hamlets of Vitry, Cysoing, and the Soumain near Anappes). The date of the Brevium exempla is uncertain, but the prevailing view is that they were written about 812. Considerably less interesting from a general historical point of view than the Capitulare de villis, the Brevium exempla have the virtue of being more detailed and factual in their reference to architectural conditions. Here we are given a precise account not only of the number and type of buildings found on each of the five aforementioned estates, but also of the construction materials, and in the case of the royal mansions, even the number and type of rooms. The following passages from the Brevium exempla describe portions of the crown estates of Anappes and its outlying settlements, Treola, and three holdings ("anonymous estates") not cited by name. The crown estate of Anappes and its outlying settlements Invenimus in Asnapio fisco dominico salam regalem ex lapide factam optime, cameras III; solariis totam casam circumdatam, cum pisilibus XI; infra cellarium I; porticus II, alias casas infra curtem ex ligno factas XVII cum totidem cameris et ceteris appendiciis bene compositis; stabolum I, coquinam I, pistrinum I, spicaria II, scuras III.

LOJSTA, GOTLAND, SWEDEN 291.C 291.B 291.A GERMANIC HOUSE 3RD-5TH CENTURY RECONSTRUCTION BY G. BOETHIUS AND J. NIHLEN [photos: Statens Historiska Museet, Stockholm] A. Foundation of house after excavation. A magnificent and one of the first excavated examples of an aisled Germanic house of the Migration Period. Its walls were made of earth carefully lined with stones. The roof was supported by two rows of wooden posts rising from flat stones all of which were still in place. These supports must have been framed at their heads into stable trusses by means of cross beams and long beams. The entrance was in the western gable wall; the hearth in the middle of the center floor toward the inner end of the hall. B and C. Reconstruction of the dwelling. Reconstructed at full scale on the original site in 1932, the dwelling follows drawings submitted by the excavators. Although now questioned in the rendering of certain details, this reconstruction nevertheless gives a very accurate impression of the unitary quality of the interior space unmarred by the fact that its roof-supporting frame divides into a multiplicity of bays. The roof may not have been covered with thatch but with turves. The walls were originally a little higher, and the entrance wall was probably not straight but hipped at the eastern end of the roof. 292.A ÞÓRSÁRDALUR VALLEY, ICELAND. HALL STÖNG PLAN OF HOUSE [after A. Roussel in Stenberger, 1943, 78, fig. 137] I. Fore room, Jorskáli II. Sleeping house, skáli, divided by transverse partition into room for men, karlskáli, and room for women, kvennaskáli III. Living house, stofa IV. Dairy, mjólkrbûr V. Room for cold storage, kjátlari The house had only one entrance and no windows; it received light and air through a lantern-surmounted opening in the roof. Its turf walls were raised on a stone foundation two courses high; the roof likewise was covered with turves. The center floor of the main house (II) was of stamped clay and contained a fireplace. Two rows of posts divided this space into three aisles, the two side aisles being raised and boarded, and partitioned transversely into men's and women's sleeping quarters. A square area boarded off at the inner end of the south aisle probably formed a sleeping alcove for the farmer and his wife. The living room (III) contained a hearth for cooking, a stone box 50cm deep. The dairy (IV) was accessible only from inside the house and contained three round impressions in the floor, presumably from large vats. Its walls were lined with lava stones to a height of 1.1m. A room presumably for cold storage (V) was accessible only from the fore room (I). The photograph (fig. 292.B) taken from the door of the living room shows the excavation of the main hall, and reveals with great clarity how the aisles and floor of the fore room were raised above the level of the center floor. The banked earth of these side aisles was retained by staked boards. Large flat stones at 2-meter intervals provided footing for the roof posts. Smaller stones set along the walls, pieces of wood still attached, show the house was wainscotted. Absence of personal effects indicates the residents were forewarned of the eruption of Mt. Hekla, in 1300, that destroyed the house and converted the fertile valley into a wasteland of lava and ash. The reconstruction (fig. 291.C) portrays the ingenious simplicity with which man could, in a harsh Atlantic climate, make a dwelling not only secure against attack, but warm and homely as well. The compact top-growth of Iceland terrain is well suited to turf-cutting. For timber the chieftains of the Saga Period relied on wood imported from Norway, or on driftwood swept in by Atlantic storms from distant North American coasts. The only locally available building material was a dwarf birch whose fine branches were used as matting for the roof turves. 292.C INTERIOR VIEW OF HOUSE.

EZINGE (GRONINGEN), THE NETHERLANDS FOUNDATIONS, HOUSE A OF WARF-LAYER VI, 4th CENTURY B.C. [photo by courtesy of A. E. Van Giffen] The remains of this flatland-level farmhouse show that its interior was divided into a broad center space and two aisles, each roughly half the width of the nave, by two rows of roof-supporting wooden posts of young, unscantled oak. Their stumps, cut a few feet above the original floor level when the house was dismantled to make a new settlement on higher ground, were well preserved to a depth of several feet. Braided wattlework walls formed an enclosure slightly inside the perimeter of outer posts and independent of them. The corners of the house were rounded, suggesting that the roof was hipped over its narrow ends. A cross partition divided the interior into a dwelling area containing a fireplace, and a much larger byre for livestock. The building was entered on one of its long sides. In a rectangular yard extending to the north, nine rows of posts formed supports for a wooden platform presumably used to store fodder and other produce. This settlement was dismantled after about a hundred years, because the rising waters of the North Sea made it unsafe to live on this horizon. As centuries passed and the inundation level continued to rise, the site developed as a dome-shaped mound on successively higher, broader levels, formed by earth, turves, and manure thrown up by the dwellers. The growth of the settlement is traceable through six layers over seven centuries. The mound attained a diameter of 450m and a center height of 5.5m. The terrain elevation seen at the right is an undisturbed portion of the present surface of the mound, now occupied by the church and houses of modern Ezinge. We found on the royal estate of Anappes the royal hall built in stone, in the best manner, three chambers, the entire house surrounded by solaria; with eleven heatable rooms42 42 On the term pisilis, cf. Gareis, 1895, 51 note 49, and III, Appendix I, p. 56. and below one cellar; two porches; seventeen other houses within the main yard,43 43 Curtis, from classical Latin cohors ("enclosure"), in medieval Latin has a variety of different though closely related meanings. It may designate a) "a fence"; b) "a fenced-in space containing the house and yard"; c) "a garden or farmyard adjoining the house"; d) "a manor" or "manorial estate" e) "a landholder's homestead"; f) "the central manor of a royal fisc"; g) "the place or household of such a fisc"; h) "the body of persons attendant to a royal household"; i) "the manorial law court" (For sources see Niermeyer, Med. Lat. Lex, 295-96). In the passages here quoted we have translated curtis simply as "yard" or where a distinction is made between curtis and curticula with "main yard" and "smaller yard". built in timber, with the same number of chambers, and other appendices, all well constructed; one stable, one kitchen, one bakehouse, two grain barns, three other barns. The main yard well protected with a fence,44 44 Tuninum: appears to be a Latinization of Old High German zûn or tûn. It stands either for "fence" or "a space enclosed by a fence". For sources see Niermeyer, op. cit., 1048; Du Cange, VIII, 1938, 209; and Grimm, XV, 1913, 406. Adalhard of Corbie uses it in the sense of "poultry-yard"; see III, Appendix II, p. 116. with a masonry gate, and above this, a solarium. The smaller yard likewise enclosed with a fence built in the usual fashion and planted with various types of trees. The document subsequently lists the dead and live stock at Anappes down to the smallest detail, and then turns to the inventory of the outlying settlements: In Grisione villa invenimus mansioniles dominicatas, ubi habet scuras III et curtem sepe circumdatam. . . .

In the estate of Gruson45 45 For the identification of Grisione with Gruson, a village 3.7 miles from Anappes, see Dopsch, 1916, 56. we came upon the outlying settlements.

Plan of the house and storage platform, the remains of which are shown in the preceding figure. The excavated area is identical with that shown in figure 296, which shows the next stage of the settlement. 295. EZINGE (GRONINGEN), THE NETHERLANDS EXTERIOR VIEW OF SETTLEMENT, 4th CENTURY B.C. [redrawn from reconstruction by H. Reinerth, 1940, 88, fig. 25] The discovery of this Iron Age village in 1931-34 was a great landmark in the history of premedieval house construction in transalpine Europe. The find showed that a house well portrayed by Albrecht Dürer (fig. 335) and Peter Bruegel the Elder (fig. 336) was already fully developed and in common use for close to 2,000 years. Later excavations brought the even more startling discovery that this same house type was a standard construction form as early as 1250 B.C., and perhaps even in the 14th century B.C. (fig. 323). In the lowlands of Holland and Northern Germany, the same house is used even today with only minor modifications, for the same purposes for which it was originally conceived (Frisian Los-hus, Lower Saxon Wohnstallhaus). Its life span is at least 3,300 years, and does not yet appear to have entered its terminal phase. The most distinctive trait of this type of structure is that it offers, with only a minimum of materials, an ingeniously simple method of covering large spaces beneath a vast roof carried by a frame of light timbers; these divide the interior of the house lengthwise into nave and two aisles (figs. 297, 298) and crosswise into a multitude of separable yet transparent bays. The building type owes its longevity to its ability simultaneously to offer spatial unity and spatial divisibility. In pre- and protohistorical times almost exclusively confined to dwelling, sheltering of animals, and harvest storage, the structure entered, in response to growing complexities of medieval life and social organization, a virtually explosive phase of functional variety, and came to fill many diverse needs. On the highest of society, it appeared as residential and administrative seat for feudal lords and their retainers (figs. 339, 340, and 344-348), including the king himself. It was used as church (Horn, 1958, 4, figs. 3-8) and Horn, 1962); as hospital for the sick and infirm (figs. 341-343); as meeting and council hall for the guilds. And from the 12th century onward in response to the rise of international trade it became, in Paris and countless smaller towns of France, the standard form for urban market halls, under whose sheltering roofs the local peasants and traders from distant places could rent stalls from which to sell produce and goods (Horn 1958, 15ff; Horn and Born, 1961, Horn, 1963). The second anonymous estate Invenimus in illo fisco dominico casam regalem cum cameris II totidemque caminatis, cellarium I, porticus II, curticulam interclusam cum tunimo strenue munitam; infra cameras II, cum totidem pisilibus, mansiones feminarum III, capellam ex lapide bene constructam; alias intra curtem casas ligneas II, spicaria IV, horrea II, stabolum I, coquinam I, pistrinum I; curtem sepe munitam cum portis ligneis II et desuper solaria.48 48 Ibid., article 32; ed. cit., 255. We found on that crown estate the royal house with two chambers and the same number of heatable rooms, one cellar, two porches, the smaller yard enclosed by a well-built fence; inside, two chambers with the same number of heatable rooms, three houses for women, a chapel well constructed in stone, two other timber houses in the court, four grain barns, two hay barns, one stable, one kitchen, one bakehouse. The main yard protected with a fence with two wooden gates and solaria above. The third anonymous estate Repperimus in illo fisco dominico domum regalem ex ligno ordinabiliter constructam, cameram I, cellarium I, stabolum I, mansiones III, spicaria II, coqinam I, pistrinum I, scuras III, Curtem tunimo circumdatam et desuper sepe munita. . . Portas ligneas II. . . .49 49 Ibid., article 34; ed. cit., 256. We found in that crown estate the royal house constructed in timber in the usual fashion, one chamber, one cellar, one stable, three dwellings, two grain barns, one kitchen, one bakehouse, three barns. The yard surrounded with a wall, protected above by a fence . . . two wooden gates. . . . While failing to reveal anything about the architectural design of the enumerated structures, the Brevium exempla are of particular value because they offer concrete information about the relative use of stone and timber in the architecture of a Carolingian crown estate. The account of the sala regalis at Anappes—as we had occasion to point out in an earlier chapter—50 50 See above, p. 36. with its open solariums, heatable rooms, and two galleried porches reads like a description of the Abbot's House on the Plan of St. Gall. Like the latter, it was composed of several stories and built in stone. The Brevium exempla, however, make it equally clear that stone was not considered to be the ordinary material. With the exception of the chapel of the second anonymous estate and the two gate houses at Anappes and Treola, stone appears to be the exclusive prerogative of the royal mansion, and the superlative form of the epithets associated with the use of this material (ex lapdie optime factam) is indicative of the high esteem in which this material was held. However, only two out of five royal mansions recorded in the document were entirely stone structures, those of Anappes and Treola. The domus regalis of the first anonymous estate had its outer walls constructed in stone, but everything else inside is in timber (exterius ex lapide et interius ex ligno bene constructam.) The domus regalis of the third anonymous estate was built entirely in wood (ex ligno ordinabiliter constructam). Timber, we will also have to assume, was used where no specific reference to any material is made for the casa regalis of the second anonymous estate. All the other structures of the five estates either are explicitly said to be built in timber or 296. EZINGE (GRONINGEN), THE NETHERLANDS PLAN, CLUSTER SETTLEMENT, Warf-layer V, 4th-3rd cent. B.C. [after Van Giffen, 1936, Beilage I, fig. 4] In the center: the main house, its axis running from west to east. The first three bays of each aisle are cross partitioned and served as stalls for cattle. To the south (placed at right angles): three smaller houses of the same construction, two of these used as dwellings; the third, like the main house, for both cattle and men. For a larger plan of the latter, see fig. 327. must be assumed to be built in timber because of the absence of any statement to the contrary. And the timbered buildings formed, of course, an overwhelming majority. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS If we review the evidence obtained from the analysis of the legal and administrative documents discussed on the preceding pages, we find ourselves confronted with results of a widely varying nature. The most illuminating of the considered sources is doubtlessly the Lex Bajuvariorum. It has furnished us with a body of specific and detailed architectural information that enables us to reconstruct the Bajuvarian standard house of the beginning of the eighth century. The Lex Alamannorum conveyed a clear idea of the 297. EZINGE (GRONINGEN), THE NETHERLANDS INTERIOR, HOUSE B, CLUSTER SETTLEMENT, Warf-layer V, 4th-3rd centuries B.C. [author's reconstruction redrawn by Walter Schwarz] House B of Warf-layer V played a dominant role in our attempt to identify the constructional features of the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall (see below, 77ff). Like the majority of the latter, it is entered broadside through a long wall, and in layout consists of a spacious inner hall with open fireplace in the axis of the house, and a peripheral suite of outer spaces accessible only from the center floor and used for more specialized functions such as sleeping, or the stabling of livestock. This is a reconstruction of the interior of House B, which appears at the bottom right of the plan of Warf-layer V, fig. 296 (and at a larger scale in fig. 327). The drawing first published in Horn, 1958, 7, fig. 13, was made before the excavator realized that the animals stood with their heads not inward, but toward the outer walls of the dwelling (cf. below, p. 53 n. 64). The braided wattle mats running along the posts on either side of the center aisle were found to be manure mats, not fodder mats as previously supposed. Since the artist is no longer alive, and since his handsome drawing portrays quite persuasively the general character of the space in the dwelling, we decided against trying to retouch the drawing; the animals remain incorrectly positioned. general layout of a West-Germanic farmstead of this period with its principal living unit, the domus or sala, and its variety of special service structures scattered throughout the yard and the fields. But they told us little, if anything, about the architectural design of these structures. The Capitulare de villis gave us an insight into the administrative complexity of a Frankish crown estate. The Brevium exempla, finally, provided us with a precise statistical account of the number and type of buildings to be found on five such Carolingian crown estates, and illustrated how on this highest level of Frankish society a new material, stone, began to intrude into the northern tradition of building in timber. They told us a good deal about the number and type of rooms of which the individual buildings were composed—but they told nothing about the constructional features of these rooms, or the houses of which they were a part. Thus we would still remain thoroughly ignorant about the architectural layout and design of a Carolingian residence and its agricultural service structures were it not for the light that has recently been thrown on this question by our colleagues in the field of archaeology. V.2.2 ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE Until the end of the second decade of this century the literary sources discussed on the preceding pages were all that students of early medieval house construction had to lean on when discussing the question of Northern parallels for the guest and service structures of the Plan of St. Gall. To be sure, some isolated excavations had already been made in Sweden and Iceland,51 51 I refer to a number of excavations that had been conducted as early as 1895 by Thorsteinn Erlingsson; see Erlingsson, Ruins of the Saga Time (London, 1899). but this fact was not widely known; and the procedure for unearthing houses whose structural members, in many cases, could be identified only by a shadowy patch of soil discoloration left in the ground as they rotted away, had as yet not developed into that highly accomplished technique so successfully practiced today. But in 1928-1931 this situation began to change when John and Nils Nihlen laid bare on the island of Gotland two three-aisles houses of the Migration Period which looked like physical embodiments of Gudmundsson's Saga house. In 1930-1934 the Dutch anthropologist Albert Egges van Giffen initiated a new era of northern house research with the excavation of an Iron Age dwelling mound in a hamlet called Ezinge (Groningen) in Holland, which revealed that a very similar type of dwelling was in use as early as the fourth century B.C. in the territory of the Frisians, a West Germanic tribe. In the two following decades the information gathered from these excavations was broadened by an increasing number of further discoveries. At the date of this writing we are able to trace, on the basis of several hundred excavated dwellings, the development of the timbered three-aisled house in the Germanic territories of transalpine Europe from its beginnings in the Middle Bronze Age through the Iron Age, into the Early Middle Ages, and through the Middle Ages to its modern survival form KÄNNE, BURS, GOTLAND, SWEDEN The first example of this long line of excavations, as just remarked, was a three-aisled dwelling, excavated in 1928 by John and Nils Nihlen, in a place called Känne, in the parish of Burs, in East Gotland (fig. 290).52 52 Nihlen, 1932, 79-91. It was 33 feet wide (10 m.) and had the extraordinary length—not as yet matched by any dwelling subsequently unearthed—of 203 feet (62 m.) A recent review of the site has disclosed that the hall was constructed in two successive phases, and in its original state was only half as long.53 53 These were the conclusions of Arne Biörnstad as expressed in Vallhagar, ed. Stenberger and Klindt-Jensen, II, 1955, 886-92. Its roof was supported by two rows of freestanding inner posts, rising in pairs, at intervals of 9 to 13 feet (3 to 4 m.). Each of these uprights was firmly secured in the ground by a ring-shaped wrapping of stones. Over fifty charred beams and numerous fragments of wood were found on the floor; among these were the remains of two large beams which were jointed into each other at right angles. The walls consisted of solid banks of earth heavily interspersed with small stones and were faced, outwardly and inwardly, with a strong lining of heavier stones. The roof must have been covered with sods of turf, as no other material would have smothered so effectively the fire that destroyed the house yet preserved so much of the timbered frame of the roof. The hall received its warmth from two hearths which lay in the middle of the center aisle, one of them 33 feet (10 m.) long. "Longfires" of this kind are well attested from the Sagas, where they are referred to as langeldar or máleldar.54 54 A typical case in point is to be found in the Njal's Saga: "There had been much rain that day, and men got wet, so long fires were made" (Regn hafdi verit mikit um daginn, ok höfdu menn ordit vátir, ok vóru gorvir máleldar); see Brennu-Njálssaga, ed. Jonsson, 1908, 23. Or, a well known passage in the Prose Edda, where we are told how Thor, as he stepped into the hall of Geirrôdr, observed that "there were great fires down the entire length of the hall" (par voru eldar stórir eptir endilangri höllini); cf. Edda Snorra Sturlusonar, ed. Legati Arnamagnaeani, I, 1848, 288. The general character of the accessories found in the house pointed to about the year A.D. 200 as the approximate period of construction. LÖJSTA, GOTLAND, SWEDEN The second house, a structure of more normal proportions, 85 feet by 33½ feet (26 m. × 10.5 m.), was excavated in the summer of 1929 in the vicinity of castle Lojsta in Gotland (fig. 291A-C).55 55 Boëthius and Nihlen, 1932. It was the same construction type except that here the roof-supporting posts were not sunk 298.B EZINGE (GRONINGEN), THE NETHERLANDS. CATTLE BARN OF Warf-LAYER IV, 2nd CENTURY B.C. [author's reconstruction, drawn by Walter Schwarz] 298.A PLAN REDRAWN FROM VAN GIFFEN 1:150 299. EZINGE (GRONINGEN), THE NETHERLANDS. CATTLE BARN OF Warf-LAYER IV, 2nd CENTURY B.C. [excavation photo by courtesy of A. E. Van Giffen] This building, like those unearthed above and beneath it, owes its magnificent state of preservation to the fact that each settlement stratum in which houses were buried in the course of successive inundations was sealed by sterile layers of sand and clay deposited after flooding, sealing their content against the infiltration of air and thus protecting it from decay. The roof-supporting posts of oak, the braided walls and cross partitions (wattled saplings of birch) were preserved to a height of 4 feet. The manure mats were found to be in such good condition that they could be walked upon without breaking. The building was 29 feet wide (7.20m) and over 75 feet long (23m) but was never excavated to its full length. Its construction was identical with that of the houses found in the earlier Warf layers (figs. 293-297). The systematic division of the aisles into stalls, together with the absence of any fireplaces, suggests that it was used for the stabling of livestock exclusively. Since every stall had room for two head of cattle, this barn must have been able to hold at least 48 animals, striking evidence of the economic wealth of these early shoreland farmers. Livestock entered and left the building through doors in the two narrow ends—a feature found in many other early Iron Age houses (figs. 304, 310, 312, 315, 316), and today in the Lower Saxon Wohnstallhaus and the Frisian Los-hus, modern descendants of this building type.

All of these stones were still in their original position (fig. 291A). The posts themselves had disappeared. Rising freely from stones as they did, they could only retain their vertical position by being framed together at the top by means of cross beams and long beams. Slight irregularities in the longitudinal alignment of the posts suggested that the cross beams lay underneath the long beams. The excavators felt so sure of their interpretation of these conditions that they undertook to reconstruct the entire hall on its original site (figs. 291B and C). Some of the details of this reconstruction have since been questioned, but the doubts amount basically to no more than that in the original house the walls were probably a little higher than they are shown at present.56 56 Biörnstad, op. cit., 956. The pottery found in the house suggests as period of construction the third century A.D. In the fifth century, for unknown reasons, the hall appears to have been abandoned. In the two decades that followed probably more than sixty houses of the Lojsta type were unearthed on the islands of Gotland and Öland, on the mainland of Sweden, in Norway and in Denmark,57 57 The Swedish material is surveyed in exemplary publications, such as the work of Nihlen and Böethius on the Iron Age farmsteads of Gotland, and the corresponding volume by Stenberger on the Iron Age farmsteads of Öland (both published in 1933), and the magnificent collective work on Vallhagar, edited in two volumes by Stenberger and Klindt-Jensen, 1955. The Norwegian material excavated prior to 1942 is summarized in Grieg, 1942. For the Danish material prior to 1937 see Hatt, 1937. For later material see Nørlund's splendid account on Trelleborg, published in 1948, and the excavation reports by Hatt and others listed in Hatt's latest great work, on the Iron Age village of Nørre Fjand, published in 1957, as well as a number of articles that have appeared during the last two decades in the Danish series Fra Nationalmuseets Arbejdsmark (Copenhagen, Nationalmuseet, 1928ff). and, last but not least, in Iceland, the country whose literary tradition introduced us to this type of dwelling. STÖNG, ÞÓRSÁRDALUR VALLEY, ICELAND Iceland was the subject of an expedition undertaken between 1934 and 1939 by a joint excavation team of Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Icelandic archaeologists.58 58 For Iceland, see the collective report on prehistoric farmsteads excavated in 1939, ed. Stenberger, 1943. I show as a typical example of the results of this expedition, the plan and excavation photos of the dwelling of a farm called Stöng in þórsárdalur Valley (fig. 292A-C) which was settled during the landnám period at the end of the ninth century and covered by the ashes of nearby Mount Hekla in an eruption in the year 1300. The dwelling unit of this farmstead consisted of a long house 98 feet long, divided into foreroom, sleeping house, living house (forstofa, area I; skáli, area II; stofa, area III), milkhouse (area IV), and cooler (area V). The sleeping hall was 54 feet long and 19 feet wide. Its aisles were raised so as to form continuous "benches"—the langpallar of Gudmundsson's Saga house. Inserted into the curbs of these benches about every 6 feet were large blocks which served as base stones for the wooden uprights that once supported the roof of the hall (fig. 292B). The fireplace lay in the middle of the center floor. Two shallow stone foundations which bisected the aisles crosswise suggest that the sleeping hall was subdivided by means of wooden cross partitions into a sleeping house for men (karlskáli) and another for women (kvennaskáli)—a distinction also well known from the Sagas. And judging from the presence of two rows of stones ranged carefully along the base line of the two long walls, the hall must have been wainscotted its entire length (the veggþili or langþili of the Sagas). There was a "crossbench" (þverpallr) on the entrance side of the hall, raised like the aisles and screened off by a wooden cross wall. I am drawing attention to this house not only because it is the keystone of cumulative archaeological evidence that established the correctness of Gudmundsson's literary work, but also because this dwelling may date from the same century in which the Plan of St. Gall was drawn. During the Iceland expedition of 1934-39 a total of eight such houses was unearthed. But by the time these excavations were conducted, discoveries of even greater significance were in progress on the Continent. EZINGE, PROV. GRONINGEN, THE NETHERLANDS The low-lying coastlands of the Netherlands and northern Germany are dotted with man-made circular earthen works on which the cattle-raising Iron Age settlers of this territory erected their dwellings in order to protect themselves from the heavy tides that flooded the surrounding flatlands during the storms that lashed the shores of the North Sea in the winter and spring. These dwelling mounds, called Warfen or Wurten in German,59 59 Warf: Old Frisian: warf, werf; New High German: werfen, "to throw," but originally perhaps in the sense of "to whirl" ("a circular mound created by the whirling action of the sand"); cf. Grimm, XIII, 1910, cols. 2012ff. Wurt: Old Frisian wort, related to Middle High German worfen; cf. Heyse, 1849, 1990. terpen in Dutch,60 60 terp: Old Frisian thorp; New High German: Dorf; related to Greek τ??βη; Latin: turba, "a gathering of small people in the open field," and hence "a rural settlement;" cf. Franck's Etymologisch Woordenboek, 1929, 695 and 127, where it is related to the Indo-European word *tereb- "to cut, to hoe;" cf. also Grimm, II, 1860, cols. 1276ff, under "Dorf." are the product of the struggle of man against a geophysical event of major importance which started some ten thousand years ago, has as yet not subsided, and is even today only temporarily checked by an elaborate system of dikes. Since the retreat of the last great glacial cap of ice the shorelands of Holland and northwestern Germany have gradually sunk away in the course of a geological action in which long periods of sinking alternated with shorter and less effective periods of uplift.61 61 With regard to these geophysical events see Reinerth, I, 1940, 75ff; and Haarnagel, 1950. The last of these cycles of sinking started in the centuries immediately preceding the birth of Christ and is still in progress. Prior to its inception the 301. WIJCHEN (GELDERLAND), THE NETHERLANDS PLAN [after Bloemen, 1933, 6, fig. 6] These aisled Iron Age houses are sited on a small chain of hills flanking a depression that may once have formed an outer arm of the river Maas. Impressions of poles in the axis of both buildings (see fig. 302) suggest they carried ridge purlins as did the house of the Lex Bajuvariorum (figs. 289.A-B). 302. WIJCHEN (GELDERLAND), THE NETHERLANDS PLAN [after Bloemen, 1933, 6, fig. 7] Alternation of heavy posts with saplings in the outer walls of both houses reveals that the braided wattle walls did not form an independent envelope, as with the Ezinge houses, but stood in line with the outer posts. 303.A FOCHTELOO (FRIESLAND), THE NETHERLANDS HOUSES OF A WEALTHY WEST GERMANIC FARMER AND HIS FOLLOWERS, 1ST-4TH CENTURIES A.D. 303.A VIEW FROM THE AIR LOOKING NORTHWARD. RECONSTRUCTION BY A. E. VAN GIFFEN, 1954, fig. 85 [drawing based on a sketch by L. Posterna] 303.B PLAN OF SETTLEMENT SHOWN IN AIRVIEW 303.B This large dwelling was associated with a hamlet of three similar houses approximately the same width, but only half its length. It was excavated in 1938 on a sandy elevation of the Dutch Geest. The presence of roof-supporting timbers was determined by discoloration in the ground from where they had rotted away. By this evidence it was ascertained that the roof of the main house was supported by two rows of free-standing inner posts, ten in each row, and that they were of quarter-split oak sunk, rounded side inward, 0.75m into the earth. This building was buttressed by a large number of exterior posts set at an angle to help neutralize the outward thrust of the roof. The walls were of wattle-daubed clay; the rounded corners and absence of any timbers capable of supporting a gable suggest that the building's roof was hipped over its narrow ends. Both main house and adjacent hamlet were protected by a pallisaded fence, and the main house additionally by a ditch. dwellings of the coastland farmers of northern Germany and Holland lay level with the flat land; but as the land began to sink away, the water of the North Sea rushed in with steadily increasing frequency and furor, and forced the settlers to remove their dwellings to successively higher levels. This they did by packing the floor level of their houses with thick layers of turves and animal manure and by re-erecting new dwellings on these mounds above the inundation level of the heavy winter tides. As this process continued century by century, it gave rise to a landscape of man-made dwelling mounds attaining in their ultimate stage a diameter of twelve or fifteen hundred feet and a maximum inner height above the surrounding land of as much as twelve to eighteen feet. The effects, although not the cause, of this peculiar geological phenomenon were known to Pliny the Elder, who visited this territory probably in A.D. 47 and transmitted his observations to posterity in a derisive yet highly descriptive passage of his Historia Naturalis: There, in a region of which one may wonder whether it belongs to the sea or to the land, a miserable race of people dwell on elevated mounds or platforms, thrown up by hand [tumulos optinent altos aut tribunalia extructa manibus], in houses erected above the level of the highest tide, resembling men who travel in ships, when the water floods the surrounding land, and shipwrecked people when the waters have dispersed.62 62 Plinius, Historia naturalis, Book XVI, chap. 1; cf. Pliny, Natural History, ed. Rackham, 1952, 387, 389. (The English translation, here quoted, is my own). A vertical profile cut through such a tumulus or Warf shows as a rule a sequence of several convex layers of soil in different coloration; the cultural remains reveal layer by layer the story of the settlement as it was abandoned and re-erected on each successive level. The physical composition of these mounds offers unusually favorable conditions for the preservation of organic materials, such as wooden uprights, wattled fences or walls, or even objects made of leather, since each abandoned settlement was covered by a solid layer of clay which sealed its contents against the corrosive action of the air. In 1930 Albert Egges van Giffen dug a trial ditch through a mound of this type at Ezinge (Groningen), Holland, and the ensuing excavation (1932-34)—a landmark in the history of European house research—enabled him to trace the development of a West-Germanic settlement from its beginnings in the fourth century B.C. to its end in the third century A.D.63 63 Van Giffen, "Der Warf in Ezinge," 1936; and idem, "Die Siedlunge in de Warfen Hollands," 1936. The earliest settlement of this site (layer VI) was a single farmstead (figs. 293 and 294), erected early in the fourth century B.C. on the natural ground of the flatland. It consisted of a three-aisled house with walls of wattlework, and a vast enclosure almost entirely taken up by a platform for the storage of hay or harvest. The timbers of the roof of the house had disappeared, but the roof-supporting posts and the braided walls of the house were preserved to a height of almost a feet (fig. 293). They consisted of five pairs of freestandings inner posts and a perimeter of thinner outer posts. The wattle walls ran independently of this system, slightly inside the ring of outer posts.

Fig. 306.A shows a house of Warf layer B of seven strata spanning roughly 3 centuries. The structure was 38 feet long, 16 wide (11.5 × 4.8m). Layer B also held a house with wattlework walls, the soil structure of which indicated it was almost 72 feet long. When the water level of the North Sea had risen high enough to make living on the flatland intolerable, the single family dwelling of layer VI was buried under a man-made mound of sods and turves (layer V) which, after having reached a height of roughly 4 feet and a diameter of approximately 90 feet, gave birth to a hamlet that now comprised a total of five houses (figs. 295-297). These houses belonged to the same construction type as did the preceding settlement and were equally well preserved. Three of them were provided with hearths, and hence must have served as dwellings for people; one was inhabited by both men and animals, evidenced by the presence of both a hearth and two narrow strips of wattle-work in front of the roof posts, which the excavator interpreted as fodder mats, but which later excavations proved to be dung mats.64 64 Van Giffen's interpretation of these mats as "fodder mats" was questioned by Helmers, 1943, who interpreted them as "manure" mats, in analogy with the later Frisian farmhouse, where the cattle invariably stood with the head to the wall of the house. His interpretation was confirmed when, in subsequent excavations, sewage trenches were discovered in the place of, or running parallel to, the wattlework mats (Wilhelmshaven-Hessens, Elisenhof; see below, p. 59, n.85 and p. 69. The same condition appears to have existed in the large house in the center, if this house, as seems likely, had a hearth in its unexcavated eastern section. Another smaller house, built at right angles against this dwelling, had neither hearth nor dung mats, and hence may have served as barn or general storage area. In the houses that accommodated livestock the aisles were subdivided into bays, or stalls, by means of braided cross partitions, each of the thus-created boxes yielding sufficient space for the stabling of two heads of cattle, facing the outer wall perimeter of the house. Three of the houses had their entrance broadside, two were entered axially. Pottery shards and other cultural accessories associated with this settlement permit a rough dating of the third century B.C. In the second century B.C. the hamlet of layer V was abandoned and the mound on which it stood was enlarged to more than twice its original diameter and raised to a level of 6 feet above the natural ground. On top of this elevation a new village was built in a circle around an open yard with the longitudinal axes of the house pointing radially to the center of the Warf (layer IV). The houses of this layer were of the same construction as those of the preceding layers, but in general considerably more spacious, as one may gather by glancing at the extraordinary cattle barn reproduced in figures 298-299. It had a length of over 75 feet (23 m.) even in its uncompleted state of excavation. The posts and carefully braided walls of this structure (twigs of birch daubed with cow manure) were preserved in almost original freshness, in spots to hip and even shoulder height. The building contained no hearth, but dung mats ran along the inner roof supports along the entire length of the structure, and the aisles were systematically subdivided into stalls by braided cross partitions. The circular village to which this barn belonged was in use from the second century B.C. to the first century A.D., but the life span of its houses was found to be considerably shorter than that of the preceding layers. In certain sectors van Giffen found that five to ten houses had been superimposed upon one another in rapid succession; and intermittent stratification of this settlement horizon with sterile 307. HODORF (HOLSTEIN), GERMANY AISLED FARM HOUSE, 1st-2nd CENT. A.D. PLAN [by W. Haarnagel; after Schwantes, 1939, 272, fig. 10] At the lowest level of the Hodorf WARF lay a flatland farm consisting of a three-aisled main house divided into living and livestock areas, and an unaisled barn built in axial prolongation of the house. In the layout of the plan two measures are clearly discernible, the longitudinal measure of column interval A and its half measure A/2. This measure and submeasure make up the length of the house and its AMBAU (= 111 feet). The width of the house (17 feet) appears to be uniformly twice that of the center aisle. While the observation is simple and even superficial, it hints, at this period and in this region, of an emerging awareness of systematic measure in simple building practice and agriculture. All trace of bulging curvature of wall line, or boat-like plan, has disappeared in favor of a rather uniform rectangular geometry. Discipline of measure prevails over scattered spacing and casual positioning of posts. A knot tied midway between the ends of a braided rope could graphically solve the problem of division by 2 for men unversed in the mystery of abstract arithmetic. It would, too, lead to successive halving in series. courses of sand gave evidence that this village, in its initial stages at least, was still dangerously exposed to the destructive action of the heavy winter tides. In the centuries that followed, the second and third centuries A.D., the Warf had to be raised again on two successive occasions (layer IV-III). The house type remained the same, except that in the later stages the wattle walls were frequently reinforced externally by heavy layers of turf. Toward the close of the third century, finally, the village perished in a fire—an event that van Giffen connected with the intrusion into the Frisian territory of the first westward-moving Anglo-Saxons. The spacious three-aisled houses were now superseded by small rectangular huts which are of no interest to this study. The excavation photos shown in figures 293 and 299 convey in persuasive terms the unusual state of preservation in which the Ezinge houses were found. They furnished conclusive evidence about the construction of the walls and the nature of the principal roof-supporting members (in places preserved to a height of 4 feet above the ground), but they told us nothing about the manner in which these members were framed together at the top into a stable roof-supporting system, nor how the roof itself was constructed. There are, nevertheless, a few inferences that can be made with relative safety from the conditions of the walls and the placement of the posts. One of these is that the roof must have been hipped over the narrow ends of the house. This must be inferred from the fact that the two end-walls of the house are not provided with posts that could have carried a gable. The reconstruction of the roof shapes shown in figures 295 and 297 render this condition correctly.65 65 The reconstruction shown in fig. 295 is taken from Reinerth, I, 1940, 88, fig. 25. The others are my own. Second, the principal posts must have been framed together lengthwise by long beams which were needed for the support of the rafters. There is no unity of opinion, however, on whether the posts were in addition connected transversely by crossbeams. Van Giffen felt that, provided the posts were set sufficiently deep into the ground, no such cross-connections were needed; and this was also, in part at least, the opinion of Joseph Schepers.66 66 Van Giffen, "Der Warf . . . ," 1936; and idem, "Die Siedlunge . . . ," 1936, 191: "Ankerbalken dürfen noch nicht angenommen werden, Kehlbalken mögen dagewesen sein." Schepers, 1943 (Plate 9, fig. 58) published a reconstruction of one of the Ezinge houses which shows the terminal pairs of posts connected by tie beams, the ones farther inward not so connected. The technical soundness of this view, however, was questioned 308. HODORF (HOLSTEIN), GERMANY EXTERIOR VIEW, AISLED HOUSE 1st-3rd CENTURIES A.D. [by courtesy of W. Haarnagel] Although conjectural in many details, this model in the Niedersachsische Landesstelle für Marschen- und Wurtenforschung, Wilhelmshaven, is nevertheless a very convincing reconstruction of the main house of the flatland farm of Hodorf unearthed in 1936-37. It demonstrates that the Lower Saxon Wohnstallhaus, surviving examples of which date only to the 15th century, is in fact a modern derivative of a prehistoric building type. As in the similar Ezinge houses, the rafters of the roof were carried by a row of posts placed slightly outside the independent wattle walls. The rounded corners of these walls, and the absence of any strong support at the building's narrow ends, suggest that its roof was hipped. Four round posts around the hearth (fig. 307) and unaligned with the principal posts, are correctly interpreted as supports for a canopy raised slightly above the main roof with lateral openings for light, and smoke escape—a device well known through the Sagas (see p. 23ff) and crucial for interpretation of the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall (see below, pp. 117ff). by T. Hermanns and Adelhart Zippelius67 67 Zippelius, 1953, 37ff. who pointed out that if the posts were only connected by long beams, the roof-supporting frame would still be exposed to the danger of bending and buckling under the strain of heavy loads of snow or the thrust of the wind during storms. Moreover, cross connection is suggested by the extremely accurate transverse alignment of the post, as it is found in all of the Ezinge houses, as well as in the majority of Warf dwellings subsequently unearthed. Whether the cross beams lay beneath the longitudinal timbers, or above them, must remain an open question. There appears to be general agreement that the peripheral row of posts—standing either within the walls of the house or at a slight distance away from them—consisted of short uprights terminating in a fork and carrying in that fork a course of horizontal timbers which served as footing for the rafters. The wattle walls themselves would have been too weak to carry the roof. In some of the Ezinge houses the outer posts were found to lean inward in close adjustment to the angle of the roof thrust—a feature that was encountered again in many houses subsequently unearthed.68 68 Most markedly so on the Elisenhof near Tönning (figs. 319 and 320 below, and Bantelmann, 1964, 233, as well as plate 62, figs. 1 and 2); but also in Einswarden (fig. 309 below) and Haarnagel, 1939, 269; and in Warendorf (see Winkelmann, 1954; and idem,). The construction of the roof itself has been the subject of some penetrating, yet careful and equally cautious, observations made by Adelhart Zippelius.69 69 Zippelius, 1953; and idem, 1954. Zippelius feels that the layout of the Ezinge houses suggests that they were covered by a continuous sequence of coupled rafters (Sparrendach). The absence of any trace of posts along the central axis of the house precludes the assumption of a ridge pole. In primitive ridge-pole construction the two sides of the roof were, in general, formed by means of poles (in German called Rofe) which were hooked into the ridge piece with their heavy ends upward and suspended in the pole by a hook formed by the stub of a former branch. This type of roof construction (Rofenkonstruktion), ideal for houses of relatively smaller dimensions, could also be employed in connection with aisled houses, but only if the width of the nave was not much greater than the width of the aisles.70 70 A typical example of a house making use of this type of construction, according to Zippelius, is house 22 of a Celtic Hallstatt settlement on the Goldberg, dating from about 800 B.C. (Zippelius, 1953, 19, fig. 2). Zippelius contends that in the Ezinge houses, where the nave is generally twice the width of the aisles, this system would not have worked, since the overhanging portions of the roof poles (over the nave) would have outweighed the lower portion of the roof, which covered the aisles. The structural stability of the Ezinge houses required that the roof poles were laid upon the supporting frame with their light ends upward. Conjectural as all this may be, it is based on sound speculation, and in the absence of more tangible archaeological evidence provides us with as good a working hypothesis as can be found at present. Zippelius made some further, no less persuasive, assumptions about the manner in which these timbers might have been jointed. The easiest, simplest, and oldest method of carrying a horizontal log is to lay it upon a row of timbers terminating in a natural fork (fig. 300A)—a method that continued to be employed long after more sophisticated forms of joining had come into use, and is practiced even EINSWARDEN (NORDENHEIM), GERMANY 309.B 309.A POST AND WATTLE HOUSE, around the birth of Christ PLAN AND RECONSTRUCTION [after Zippellius, 1953, 38, fig. 8] The site is on the estuary of the river Weser. The construction of this house is virtually identical in all respects with the houses of the cluster settlement of Layer V of the Ezinge Warf (figs. 295-97 and fig. 327). Like most of those, as well as the chieftains's house at Fochteloo (fig. 304), its living quarters (two westernmost bays) are separated from the stables (two easternmost bays) by a center bay entered through a door in the middle of the southern long wall, while the cattle enter through a door in the eastern end wall. The house is 33 feet long and 16½ feet wide. today by primitive men throughout the entire world. When natural forks of the desired height could not be found among the available logs, the fork had to be shaped with tools. The closest man-made imitation of the natural fork— and here again I think Zippelius is correct—is a joint to which he refers as Pfostenzange and which is obtained by simply cogging the notched portion of a large beam into a corresponding slit in the head of the upright beneath it (fig. 300B). Another way of locking posts into horizontal timbers (either at the top, bottom, or in-between) is by means of mortice and tenon joints (Verzapfung), as shown in figure 300C and D, or by halving them into one another. Halving would also appear to be the most sensible joint for the tips of the rafters, the connections being given additional strength at this point, perhaps, by some braided strands of willow. The reconstructions shown in figures 297 and 298 attempt to conform with this thinking.71 71 Both reconstructions were made before I had an opportunity to familiarize myself with Dr. Zippelius' thinking. Fig. 298 is a revision of and supersedes, an earlier reconstruction of this cattle barn which I had published in an article dealing with the origins of the medieval bay system (see Horn, 1958, 6, fig. 9). WIJCHEN, MAAS ESTUARY, THE NETHERLANDS When the Ezinge houses were discovered in 1930-34 they were a new and entirely isolated phenomenon on the Continent. But in the five years that followed, before the outbreak of World War II, every subsequent summer brought new results. While van Giffen was still at work at Ezinge, F. Bloemen unearthed under less favorable soil conditions another group of aisled houses of the first century B.C. on a mountain range near the estuary of the river Maas, near Wijchen.72 72 Bloemen, 1933. The ground plans showed the transverse alignment of inner and outer posts, which was typical of the houses of layer V and IV of the Ezinge Warf. The outer walls consisted of an alternating sequence of one heavy and two lighter posts; the heavy posts stood in line with the principal posts (figs. 301, 302). In other aspects, however, the construction differed. The houses had posts along their central axes, an arrangement that is in general interpreted as an indication of the presence of a ridge pole. The excavation showed that ridge-pole construction, although unusual, was nevertheless not absent in this territory, an observation that was confirmed by later finds in other places.73 73 On the Warf Feddersen Wierde, see below, pp. 59ff and Haarnagel, 1963, 288; on Warendorf, see below, pp. 76ff and Winkelmann, 1954, 211, fig. 3; and on the Elisenhof, see below, pp. 69ff and Bantelmann, 1964, 233. 310.X ISOMETRIC VIEW 310. CROSS SECTION The house was 102 feet long, 29 feet wide. The nave and one aisle were 10½ feet wide, the narrow aisle 8 feet wide. The distribution of stones—some for pavement some for lining or packing of wall-post sockets, others for footing of principal roof supports—reveals that the house was divided lengthwise into a nave and two aisles, and crosswise into fourteen bays. In the first ten, only the center floor was paved, and the aisles were strewn with sand. In the last four bays the pavement ran across the width of the dwelling. This is the well-known T-shaped floor plan of the Lower Saxon Wohnstallhaus. In the house above, bay depth in the stable was 6½ to 8¼ feet. In the living area the distance between trusses increased, and in the terminal bay containing the hearth is almost twice as deep as the others. Since the principal inner posts of the house were footed on stone blocks rather than in post holes, they must have been framed at their heads by long beams and cross beams somewhat in the manner shown above. The ANKERBALKEN (cross beams terminating in long tenons morticed into the main posts a few feet below the tie beams) shown in Rieck's reconstruction (Reick, 1942, fig. 2) appeared to us to be an anachronistic feature for so early a structure and for that reason has been omitted in our cross section.

This settlement comprised a long house, protected by fence and ditch, and a nearby hamlet, likewise fenced in, consisting of three smaller houses and a couple of open barns. All of these houses were aisled and were entered broadside by two entrances lying opposite one another in the middle of the long walls and giving access to a median crosswalk that separated the stables for the cattle from the living quarters of the people. The long house of the chieftain had a third additional entrance at the rear of the stables, primarily for the use of livestock. This house was 70 feet long and 21 feet wide (21·40 m. × 6·50 m.). The great significance of van Giffen's excavations of Ezinge was that they solved an enigma that had puzzled students of European house construction for over a century. They brought to light the prehistoric prototypes of two well-known and closely related modern house types, namely that of the Lower Saxon "Wohnstallhaus" and of the Frisian "los-hus." The oldest surviving specimens of these two widespread house types date from the early sixteenth or, at the most, from the end of the fifteenth century.75 75 For quick information on these two important house types, see Hekker, 1957, 216ff, and Haarnagel, 1939. In the ensuing discussions the basic similarities between van Giffen's Iron Age houses, on one hand, and that of the Lower Saxon or Frisian farmhouse on the other, have sometimes been forgotten. Surely enough, there are distinctive constructional differences, which need not be dwelt upon here, yet the basic layout and functional use of the house is identical: three aisles, the center aisle being used as a passage and hearth place, the aisles serving as shelter for the livestock and sleeping quarters for the farmer and his family. Van Giffen's excavations demonstrated that this type was infinitely older than anybody had heretofore presumed it to be, and their immediate prototypes could now be traced back as far as the fourth century B.C. It was clearly only a matter of time for the connecting medieval links to be found. Once more it fell to van Giffen to lead the way in this search. A trial ditch run through a Warf in the vicinity of the village of Leens (Groningen), Holland, revealed the profiles of a settlement whose life span started approximately at the point where that of Ezinge ended. And in a systematic excavation of this Warf conducted in the subsequent year, van Giffen76 76 Van Giffen, 1935-40. could trace his aisled Iron Age house through seven successive layers from the end of the seventh century A.D. to the beginning of the eleventh. Altogether some twenty-three houses came to light: some of them built with wattle walls, others with walls of turves; but all of them had their roofs supported by two rows of freestanding inner posts. I reproduce as a typical example the plan of a house of Layer B (fig. 305), after van Giffen, and a cross section of this house (fig. 306), as suggested by Zippelius.77 77 Zippelius, 1953, 32, fig. 5. HODORF, SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN, GERMANY Van Giffen's work in Holland was only a beginning. In 1936 Werner Haarnagel launched the first of an equally exciting series of excavations in the adjacent coastlands of northern Germany, where he discovered a Germanic flatland farm of the first and second century, near the village of Hodorf, Schleswig-Holstein, on the banks of the river Stör, not far from its confluence with the river Elbe.78 78 On Hodorf, see Haarnagel, 1937; and idem, 1939, 271-75. It consisted of a three-aisled dwelling with hearth, to which a one-aisled barn was added axially at a slightly later date (fig. 307). The construction method employed in this dwelling was identical, in all details, with those of van Giffen's houses at Ezinge: six pairs of inner posts serving as principal roof supports, an outer perimeter of wall posts serving as footing for the rafters, plus the customary envelope of wattle walls running in total independence of the supporting members. The aisles were divided into cattle stalls in the rearward part of the house, as in Ezinge, except that in Hodorf this area was entirely matted with wattlework. A distinctive feature of the Hodorf farm was that its hearth was framed by four posts which were out of line with the principal roof supports and also differed from the latter by being round. They were obviously not part of the regular structural system. Haarnagel thought that they might have carried a smoke flue, or that they belonged to a separate inner armature of poles which carried an elevated section of the main roof over an opening in the ridge above the hearth site, serving as light source and as smoke outlet. A similar arrangement of poles ranged in a square around the hearth had been observed in other Iron Age houses in vastly distant places.79 79 As early as 1928 by Gudmund Hatt in an Iron Age house at Kraghede, Denmark, see Hatt, 1928, 254; in 1932 by F. Bloemen at Wijchen, Holland, see Bloemen, 1933; and in 1935 by Otto Doppelfeld in NauenBärhorst, see Doppelfeld, 1937/38, 312. Also see below, 119ff. Haarnagel has reconstructed the Hodorf house in a handsome model which is displayed at the Niedersächsische Landesstelle für Marschen- und Wurtenforschung in the city of Wilhelmshaven (fig. 308). While many of the details in the roof section of this model must by necessity remain conjectural, the concept of the house as a whole is unquestionably sound. The pottery found in the Hodorf house indicated as time of occupancy the first and second century A.D. Toward the close of the second century the site was imperiled by tidal inundations. Its inhabitants made an attempt to save the house by filling it up inside with sand, 312. WILHELMSHAVEN-HESSE, GERMANY EXTERIOR VIEW, AISLED HOUSE, 6TH-9TH CENTURIES MODEL IN THE NIEDERSÄCHSISCHES LANDESINSTITUT FÜR MARSCHEN- UND WURTENFORSCHUNG [after Haarnagel] The excavation of Warf of Wilhelmshaven-Hesse (trial ditch in 1939 disrupted by World War II, resumed in 1949, continued in 1950) offered the first evidence that the aisled and timbered Iron Age hall known through the excavations of Hodorf (figs. 307-308) and Einswarden (fig. 309) continued to be used in the coastlands of northern Germany in early medieval times. As it was excavated the Warf revealed, in settlement horizons extending from the 7th through 10th centuries A.D., aisled and bay-divided houses ranging in length from 39½ to 59 feet, and in width, 17½ to 21 feet. The house model shown here is a reconstruction of one of the larger houses of the Warf. Like those of Fochteloo and Einswarden, it had an axial entrance for cattle in one of the narrow walls and a lateral entrance to the living area close to the opposite end of the house. a little more than 2 feet above its original floor level. A number of posts were reset on this occasion, and the roof may have been replaced entirely, but in all other respects the house remained the same, except that now it was used exclusively as a dwelling. It continued to be used in this form until the end of the third century when it made room for a new but smaller house of the same construction type. EINSWARDEN, GERMANY The operations at Hodorf had barely been completed, when in the winter of 1937/38 Haarnagel was called to a site in the vicinity of the village of Einswarden,80 80 The excavations of Einswarden are summarized briefly in Haarnagel's article on the origins of the Lower Saxon farmhouse (1939, 267-71). A systematic excavation report has not come out. on the left bank of the estuary of the Weser river, where the heavy machinery of a modern land improvement project had edged into the core of an ancient dwelling mound. Systematic excavations were undertaken in the summer of 1938 but remained confined to only a small sector of this large mound. They brought to light three post-and-wattle houses of the period around the birth of Christ and below these dwellings, in an even earlier settlement horizon which reached back to the second and third centuries B.C., four additional houses of the same type. The largest of the upper settlement measured 56 feet by 21 feet (17 m. × 6·5 m.); the smallest, 33 feet by 16 feet (10 m. × 5 m.). The latter, having its wood work practically intact to a height of 16 inches (40 cm.), was especially well preserved. Haarnagel could observe that the outer posts of house II leaned inward. He assumed that the posts that he found were the lower portions of rafters that rose from the ground directly, and reconstructed the house accordingly.81 81 Model reconstruction in the exhibition rooms of the Niedersächsische Landesstelle für Marschen- und Wurtenforschung in Wilhelmshaven, Germany. In another reconstruction published in Haarnagel's essay on the northwest European aisled hall and its development in the North Sea coastland ("Das nordwesteuropäische . . . ," 1950, 84, fig. 3), Haarnagel reconstructs the outer posts as long oblique forks that buttress the long beams that rest on the principal uprights. Albert Genrich82 82 Genrich, 1942, 43. and Zippelius83 83 Zippelius, 1953, 31ff. consider it more likely that these oblique outer posts were short, that they carried an outer frame of horizontal poles that served as footing for the rafters, and leaned inward in order to counteract the outward thrust of the roof, as shown in figure 309 B. AALBURG, NEAR BEFORT, LUXEMBOURG With the outbreak of World War II, all of this excavation ceased. Save for an isolated excavation conducted by Gustav Rieck during the German occupation of Luxembourg at Aalburg, near Befort,84 84 On the excavations at Aalburg near Befort, Luxembourg, see Rieck, 1942. nothing new was added to our knowledge of the early history of the three-aisled timber house. Rieck uncovered the foundations of an aisled timber hall of extraordinary dimensions (102 feet long and 29 feet broad [31 m. × 8·8 m.]) which antedated even the earliest Ezinge houses (figs. 310, 311). Here, it seems, in a dwelling that had been constructed as early as 500 B.C., in territory where Celtic and Germanic influences intermingled, the excavator had come upon a floor plan that anticipated by one millennium the T-shaped Flet and Dele arrangement of the Lower Saxon farmhouse. The roof-supporting posts of this house were not sunk into holes but rose freely from base blocks above the ground, attesting overhead a solid frame of cross and long beams. This site raised the interesting question, whether the aisled West-Germanic timber house might not have been adopted at a very early date in the territory of the neighboring Celts. WILHELMSHAVEN-HESSE, GERMANY When excavation work could be resumed after the war had ended, Haarnagel added a number of excavations to his preceding work, which enabled him to trace the history of the aisled timber house both further back and further forward in time. A trial ditch dug in 1939, just as the war broke out, in Hesse, one of the suburbs of the city of Wilhelmshaven, had suggested the presence, in a settlement stratum of the seventh century A.D., of aisled houses of the Hodorf-Einswarden type, such as he had previously been able to assert only for the span of 300 B.C. to A.D. 200. Systematic excavations undertaken in 1949 and continued in 195085 85 On Wilhelmshaven-Hessens, see Haarnagel, 1950, 88-90; and idem, 1951. surpassed all expectations by establishing the existence of this house type in settlement layers not only of the seventh, but also of the eighth and ninth centuries A.D. And in 1951-53 this span was further extended into the eleventh, the twelfth, and thirteenth centuries through the excavation of a medieval trading settlement in the city of Emden.86 86 On Emden, see Haarnagel, 1955, 9-78. The result of these excavations is visually summarized in a reconstruction model of one of the houses of Wilhelmshaven-Hesse, here shown as figure 312. JEMGUM, NEAR LEER, GERMANY Conversely, in an excavation conducted in 1954 Haarnagel had the good fortune of unearthing in a place called Jemgum near Leer,87 87 On Jemgum, see Haarnagel, 1957, 1-44. The house of Jemgum was inhabited only by human beings. Other houses of the same construction type and the same period accommodating men and cattle under the same roof have in the meantime been unearthed a little farther downstream on the same bank of the river Ems, in a place called Boomborg/Hatzum; for a preliminary report on this, see Haarnagel, 1965, 132-64. on the left bank of the river Ems, an aisled house with pottery shards and artifacts ranging from the beginning of the seventh to the end of the fifth century B.C. (transition from Bronze Age to Early Iron Age.) The walls of the Jemgum house (figs. 313-314) were a different construction type from those of the previously discovered houses. They were built of horizontal logs of ash, squared off, and held in place by vertical ash saplings. In the middle of each long wall there was an entrance protected by a projecting porch. The roof was carried by four freestanding inner posts of a diameter of eight inches (20 cm.), dug sixteen inches (40 cm.) into the ground. The hearth lay in the middle of the center aisle, in the northeastern half of the house. On the opposite side of the house the ground was covered by a wooden floor covering of alder planks, which suggests that this section of the house was used as a living and sleeping unit. FEDDERSEN-WIERDE, NEAR BREMERHAVEN, GERMANY Haarnagel's most successful excavation—begun in 1955, continued every subsequent summer, and still in progress at the time of this writing—was undertaken on an Iron Age Warf called Feddersen-Wierde on the right bank of the river Weser not far from Bremerhaven. As this dwelling mound was peeled off, layer by layer, it released the remains of forty-eight houses; the majority were in excellent condition, reflecting the various stages of growth of a settlement that had started as a flatland farm at about the time Christ was born, and was subsequently raised, in seven stages, to successively higher levels, until around the year 400 it had reached an ultimate height of 13 feet (4 m.) above its original starting point and a diameter of about 656 feet (200 m.). The results of this extraordinary excavation are known so far through preliminary reports only.88 88 On the excavation of Feddersen-Wierde, see Haarnagel, 1956; 1957; 1958; 1961; and 1963. In figure 315 I reproduce a plan of settlement period IIB, which shows the Warf in the stage it had reached sometime during the first century. At this time the settlement consisted of a principal Warf and a secondary smaller Warf, both protected by a peripheral ditch. The principal Warf, some 295 feet long and 98 feet wide (90 m. × 30 m.), accommodated a cluster of four houses; the smaller, a cluster of only two. The houses varied considerably in size, the largest measuring 97 feet by 21 feet (29·50 m. × 6·75 m.); the smallest, 33 feet by 16 feet (10·00 m. × 5·00 m.) Each house formed a self-sufficient agricultural entity, combining under one roof the living quarters of its owner and the stables for his livestock (fig. 316). The hay and harvest was stored in separate open sheds to the side of the house. The layout of the main houses is identical with that of the contemporaneous houses that van Giffen had encountered at Fochteloo (figs. 303-304). Like them, the houses of the Feddersen-Wierde had their principal entrance arranged in opposite pairs in the long walls, giving access to a crosswalk which separated the quarters of the humans from those of the animals. In the smaller houses where the areas of living quarters of the owner and the stables for his livestock were more or less equal, this led to a fairly balanced arrangement with the entrances often exactly in the center. But in the houses of the leading families, superior wealth in cattle led to an elongation of the stables and to the addition in the latter of a subsidiary C. ELEVATION principal members only, shown; for more complete assembly see exterior view on next page. B. CROSS SECTION A. PLAN detail of plan at jamb of doorway 313.A. B, C JEMGUM, LEER, GERMANY AISLED HOUSE, 7TH-5TH CENTURIES B.C. [redrawn from W. Haarnagel, 1957, 21, Plan. No. 7] The site is on the left bank of the estuary of the river Ems. The house was small, no more than 15 feet wide and 25 feet long. It was used exclusively as a dwelling and gave no evidence of ever having sheltered animals. In the middle of each long wall, slightly off center, were opposing entrances protected by projecting porches. The roof was carried by two pair of inner posts (unscantled oak trunks, dia. 20cm) dividing the house into a central area of roughly 6½ × 13 feet asymmetrically placed, and with aisles all round it. The hearth lay in the axis of this center space, in the western half of the house which had a simple clay floor and must have served as kitchen. The floor of the space between the eastern pair of posts and the eastern end wall was covered with wooden planks cut from alder trees; this area, better insulated from dampness than any other in the house, must have served as living and sleeping quarters. All structural members of the dwelling that were posted into the ground, or that lay atop the ground, were found to be in good condition, many of the boards forming the wooden floor of the presumed sleeping area were still in place. 314. EXTERIOR VIEW JEMGUM, LEER, GERMANY AISLED HOUSE, 7TH-5TH CENTURIES B.C. [redrawn from W. Haarnagel] Drawings and models are in the Niedersächsisches Landesinstitut für Marschen- und Wurtenforschung The walls of the house were made of squared ash logs, of which the bottom course was still well preserved. They were held in place at distances varying between 5 and 6½ feet, by paired saplings pointed and driven into the ground to a depth of about 2 feet, with five pairs in each long wall, and three in each end wall. At their meeting points in the corners of the house, the ash logs had rotted away, and for that reason, it could not be ascertained in what manner they were jointed. It seems reasonable to assume that they were notched into each other at right angles, since otherwise these timbers would have been subject to displacement from the thrust of the rafters. Since the free-standing inner posts were only set 15¾ inches into the ground, they must have been framed crosswise at their heads by tie beams, and lengthwise by longitudinal plates serving as footing for the rafters, or supporting them in midspan. There were no roof-supporting posts in the end walls, indicating that the roof was probably hipped over the building's narrow ends. The construction of the walls, although common in heavily wooded areas of Scandinavia and Alpine regions, is atypical for this part of Europe. 315. FEDDERSEN-WIERDE. PLAN [after Haarnagel, 1957, fig. 2] AISLED HOUSES OF WARF-LAYER II B, 1ST-2ND CENTURIES Haarnagel's exploration of this Warf, conducted from 1955 onward under the auspices of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, was the German counterpart to van Giffen's excavation of the Warf of Ezinge (figs. 292-99). The site, on the right bank of the estuary of the Weser, was carefully selected after many sample drillings from a chain of nine dwelling mounds running in an almost straight line south to north over a distance of 15 kilometers. The Warf encompassed seven settlement horizons, a new one every 50-80 years, to compensate for the steadily rising innundation level. The earliest settlement was a flatland farm built around the birth of Christ. The Warf was abandoned around 400 A.D. when it had reached a height of about 13 feet (4m). The dwellings buried in its various layers were as well preserved as those of Ezinge and for the same reasons (see caption, fig. 299); and were of the same construction type. The plan above shows the Warf in the stage it had reached toward the end of the first century A.D. FEDDERSEN-WIERDE, NEAR BREMERHAVEN, GERMANY 316.B AUTHORS' RECONSTRUCTION (DRAWN BY WALTER SCHWARZ) SEE FIGURE 175. PAGE 216, VOL. 1, FOR A LARGER INTERPRETATION OF THIS DRAWING 316.A PLAN [after Haarnagel, 1956, Pl. 3] AISLED HOUSE OF A CHIEFTAIN, Warf-LAYER II B, 1ST-2ND CENTURIES With the cattle barn of Ezinge (figs. 298-99) this is one of the finest examples of a house type widely diffused in the Germanic territories of Holland and Northern Germany during the first millenium B.C. and throughout the entire Middle Ages. The house was 97 feet long (28.50m) and 21 feet wide (6.75m). It combined under one roof the owner's living quarters and the stables for his livestock. In the area used by animals (eastern 52½ feet of the house) the roof-supporting trusses were more narrowly spaced, leaving in the aisles between each pair of posts a stall for two head of cattle (32 head altogether). As in the chieftain's house at Fochteloo (fig. 304) stables and living area were separated by an entrance bay accessible through doors in the long walls, while animals entered through a gate in the eastern end wall. The walls and all the internal cross partitions were done in wattlework, daubed with manure. The stable area had the traditional mats of wattlework on which the manure was gathered, with cess trenches beneath to allow for drainage. The walk between these mats was paved with turves laid between floor beams running parallel with the trenches. 318.A, C, D.

Wattlework was in the minority, generally used as infilling between posts (as in figs. 301-302); it was not a load-bearing structural feature. Of the boards above, it is not certain whether A was set horizontally or vertically; D would have been used only horizontally, with the groove downward. Braiding walls from thin strips of oak (B) is a technique well known from later medieval buildings (see Charles and Horn, 1973, 20-21, figs. 21 and 23). 317. FEDDERSEN-WIERDE, NEAR BREMERHAVEN, GERMANY HOUSE OF THE EARLIEST SETTLEMENT HORIZON. DETAIL [photograph by courtesy of W. Haarnagel] These are remains of two of the principal roof-supporting posts of the house, for which the builder used the round trunks of relatively young and slender oaks without debarking them. The superb state of preservation of both timbers and the wattlework of which the walls and cross partitions in the aisles were formed owes to the fact that whenever a house was abandoned because of floods and then rebuilt on higher ground, its remains were soon covered by layers of fine silt deposited during floods, thus sealing its contents against air and bacterial decay. axial entrance, primarily used for livestock. The house thus attained the distinctive T-shaped floor plan which later became the hallmark of the Lower Saxon farmhouse. The long house in the northwest corner of the main Warf of settlement period II-B of the Feddersen-Wierde is one of the finest of this type of Iron Age house known to date. In figure 316A I reproduce its plan, after Haarnagel, and in figure 316B a tentative reconstruction of my own. The excavation photo shown in figure 317 of one of the cattle boxes of house I of the oldest settlement horizon of Feddersen-Wierde, gives an idea of the magnificent state of preservation in which the walls and roof-supporting posts of some of the older houses of this site were found. The occupants of settlement-horizon II of the Warf Feddersen-Wierde were field-ploughing and cattle-raising farmers. In settlement-horizon III (first to second century A.D.) the economy, and with it the entire social structure of the village, begins to change. The dominant architectural feature now, as well as in all the subsequent horizons (IV, V, VI, and VII, ranging from the third into the fifth century A.D.), is a large aisled hall (without stalls for cattle and carefully fenced in), used as the residence of a person of conspicuous wealth and prominence. Next to this hall is a second hall (likewise without cattle stalls) which Haarnagel believes was used as an assembly place for the entire community. Animal husbandry and agriculture give way to industry and trade, and the growth of a new class of workmen who lived in smaller houses and worked in the service of their trading chieftain. ELISENHOF, NEAR TÖNNING, SCHLESWIG, GERMANY 319. 320. AISLED HOUSE, 9TH CENTURY A.D. [excavation photos courtesy of A. Bantelmann] The overview (fig. 319) of the Warf shows the remains of the houses; below (fig. 320), the detail shows a portion of the wattled walls of the house with inclined posts carrying a peripheral course of poles on which the rafters were footed. The great historical significance of the excavation of this Warf is that it closed the gap between the Iron Age and Migration Period houses (shown in figs. 293-318) and their medieval derivatives (figs. 339-354). The settlement was started on flatland in the 7th century; its subsequent development could be traced clear into the 11th century. In layout and construction its houses were virtually identical with those of Ezinge (figs. 293-299), and Feddersen-Wierde (figs. 316-317). They were in some places preserved to a height of 7 feet. 321. ANTWERP, BELGIUM. UNAISLED AND AISLED HOUSES PLANS, EARLY 11TH CENTURY A.D. [after A. Van de Walle, 1961, 128, fig. 35] The house plans and reconstruction shown here and in fig. 322 are in themselves of no particular architectural distinction. But they do mark the historical point at which the aisled and bay-divided timber house, the premedieval history of which has been briefly traced in these pages, attempted to gain a hold in the new and rapidly developing medieval cities. Excavations conducted in 1955-1957, in what was then the old city of Antwerp (and is now the center of the modern town) brought to light three medieval habitation levels in an average depth of 5 to 7 feet (1.50-3.50m) beneath the present street level. By pottery and other artifacts these strata could be dated: the lowest to about 850-976, the middle to about 976-1063, and the top level to 1063-1225. On each horizon the excavator found three houses in a row, side by side, gable walls facing the street. The houses shown here belong to the middle level. The larger one to the right is aisled; the others, narrower and shorter, are unaisled. These two are divided internally into a main hall with hearth, and with one or more partitions to the rear perhaps serving as private or storage rooms. Aisled houses were well suited to the open terrain of the nonurban countryside. But in the densely built cities, with open land at a premium, the aisled structure of one story had limited utility and future. Some wealthy individuals or institutions could, to be sure, acquire enough urban land upon which to build expansive aisled houses on one level, and could afford the expense of their maintenance. Such was the case with ecclesiastical overlords (see figs. 339-340) or corporate bodies such as the Church (figs. 341-343) or the guilds. But for the most part, aisled dwellings were impractical in, and proved antithetical to the function of the city. The type came to be replaced by narrower structures of multiple stories providing space above ground level, set with gable walls toward the street and side walls almost touching, a picturesque and early characteristic of new urban architecture. 322. ANTWERP, BELGIUM AISLED HOUSE, EARLY 11TH CENTURY [the reconstruction illustrated is redrawn from A. van de Walle, 1961, 129, FIG. 36] This isometric rendering, conjectural in detail yet fairly certain in general lines, illustrates more persuasively than the plans of the preceding figure why it was that aisled houses could not survive the pressures of dense urban development. The low, aisled house of the open country, in the struggle to adapt it to urban row-house conditions, soon proved to be a wasteful use of costly and limited city space. Therefore this house type was, in the cities quickly discarded. In process of adaptation, the remaining nave (after aisles were eliminated) could, to be sure, have been raised; but the skeletal construction of the old northwest European all-purpose house was never intended to bear the load of superincumbent stories. A new type of timber framing with strong load-bearing walls evolved to make timber framing possible in construction of narrow urban houses. But because of its total vulnerability to fire, the timber house eventually came to give way, as the cities grew, to masonry houses. BÄRHORST, NEAR NAUEN, GERMANY To the successful excavation work by van Giffen and Haarnagel in the coastlands of Holland and northwestern Germany, one has to add the work of others. As early as 1935-37 Otto Doppelfeld had unearthed a palisaded village of an estimated fifty aisled houses, on the Bärhorst,89 89 On Bärhorst-Nauen, see Doppelfeld, 1937/38. a shallow, sandy plateau in a marshy swale near Nauen (Berlin). The site had been discovered in the course of trenching operations undertaken before the installation of a giant sewage disposal plant. Remnants of pottery and other cultural accessories showed that the village was constructed around A.D. 250 and that it was held in occupancy for about a century. Since it lay in an environment that was utterly unsuited for successful agricultural exploitation and perished in a fire that seems to have been associated with a planned and systematic abandonment (no objects of any use were left), Doppelfeld concluded that it might have been the temporary site of a wandering Germanic tribe who discarded the site when they found prospects for the conquest of more suitable land. While basically adhering to the same construction type, the Bärhorst houses showed a great variability in the treatment of their walls (fig. 318). Some of the houses had simple wattle walls; in others the walls were formed by boards mounted horizontally or vertically between the wall posts. Still others were braided from thin split pieces of straight wood (leftovers from the hewing of the structural timbers). The Bärhorst village showed that the aisled pre-medieval timber house extended into the third and fourth century A.D. eastward as far as the longitude of the modern city of Berlin. TOFTING AND ELISENHOF, NEAR TÖNNING, SCHLESWIG-HOLSTEIN, GERMANY Albert Bantelmann, on the other hand, pressed the search northward by excavating, in the summers of 1949 and 1950, a dwelling mound at Tofting (Schleswig-Holstein)90 90 On Tofting, see Bantlemann, 1951 (preliminary report); and idem, 1955 (final and comprehensive report). at the mouth of the river Eider, close by the Danish border. His excavations showed that conditions in the homeland of the Anglo-Saxons were identical with those which van Giffen and Haarnagel had found prevalent in the adjacent territories of the Frisians. Tofting was a relatively modest site; but from 1957 onward, in annual excavations as yet not terminated, Bantelmann peeled off, layer by layer, in the Warf Elisenhof,91 91 On the excavations of Elisenhof, see Bantlemann, 1964 (preliminary report). near the town of Tönning at the mouth of the river Eider in Schleswig, the remains of a village that was founded in the seventh or eighth century A.D. and remained in continuous occupation deep into the High Middle Ages. The earliest settlement, which is so far known only through a preliminary report, was built on natural ground on one of the banks of the river Eider. Later the site was raised and peripherally expanded by heavy deposits of manure and clay, until it finally comprised an area of roughly seven hectares. The occupants of the earliest settlement were cattle-raising farmers, which is attested by the 323. ELP, PARISH OF WESTERBORK DRENTHE, THE NETHERLANDS AISLED LONG HOUSE OF A BRONZE AGE SETTLEMENT ABOUT 1250 B.C. PLAN [after H. T. Waterbolk, 1964, fig. 5] Entered through two transeptal porches leading to a central entry way, this dwelling was divided by it into halves, one for dwelling and the other for stabling livestock, a distinction that became traditional. From the outside this house must have been very similar in appearance to the two longhouses of Warendorf (figs. 326. E-F), nearly 2,000 years its junior. In the dwelling portion, inner and outer posts were carefully aligned to form a widely spaced, strong sequence of roof-supporting trusses. In the stable half posting was lighter, closer, and the posts probably served as dividers for the stalls. CHEDDAR, SOMERSET, ENGLAND AISLED PALACE HALLS, 12TH &amp; 13TH CENT. [courtesy of P. Rahtz, and Ministry of Building and Works, Crown Copyright] 324.A The composite plan shows the layout of East Halls I, II, and III. The original ten-bay building dates to the early 12th century. It was replaced 100 years later by a smaller six-bay hall 71 feet by 48 feet. At this time the roof supports were set into new square post holes, some of which overlapped the round ones of the original hall. Toward the end of the 13th century the second hall was replaced by a third of yet smaller size 66 by 42 feet) and without aisles. 324.B At the time of Henry I (1100-1135) the hall was an aisled, ten-bay structure, 110 feet long and 54 feet wide. The course of the outer walls could be identified by large post holes, at 8-foot intervals, linked by ground timbers. The roof-supporting posts were apparently rough-scantled logs over 15 inches in diameter, set into round post holes packed with gravel. presence of bone deposits of cattle, sheep, pigs, and horses in, respectively, decreasing magnitude. The predominant dwelling in all layers was the aisled post-and-wattle house, giving shelter to humans and animals under the same roof. Layout and construction were in all essential features identical with those of the houses of Ezinge and Feddersen-Wierde, and the state of preservation left no feature in doubt (figs. 319, 320). Main posts and wattle walls survived in certain cases up to a height of 7 feet (2 m.). In some houses the outer posts consisted of inward leaning timbers of unusually heavy scantling (fig. 320)—no doubt the supports of a peripheral course of poles that served as footing for the rafters. The floors of the houses were formed by turves of clay, heavily matted with roots. The section of the house that contained the hearth and served as living quarters invariably lay on a higher level than the part that contained the stalls for the cattle. From the higher level the floor gradually slanted down to reach its lowest point at the end of the stable section, thus affording easy drainage for the liquid waste of the animals, which was conducted downward in carefully constructed flues—the same type of flues (one groundboard and two sideboards) used today in the farmhouses of the same district, where it is called Grüpp. The length of the houses varied with the number of cattle owned by each farmer. The width amounted uniformly to about 17 feet (5 m.)—as it did in van Giffen's and Haarnagel's early Iron Age houses—a dimension obviously conditioned by the fact that it offers a comfortable minimum of space for two rows of animals and a central lane of access with drains for the waste products. As in the Iron Age houses, the roof received its main support from two ranges of freestanding inner posts. The cattle stood in pairs in each stable, their heads turned toward the walls of the house. The cross partitions by which their boxes were formed consisted of split logs set into the ground in palisade fashion. The outer walls were wattled, with the twigs wound around a sequence of thin posts alternating at regular intervals with heavy posts which must have supported the wall plates. Only a small percentage of the houses was oriented from east to west. The determinant factor in the choice of the axis appears to have been the slope of the Warf, as it offered best drainage. Besides the standard house there was a variety of non-aisled smaller buildings, some with wattle walls, others with walls of turf; the latter, apparently used as weaving houses. Two of these smaller houses were in ridge-pole construction. The Elisenhof is altogether a spectacular site. Its full evaluation, which is forthcoming, will unquestionably give us new insights into the constructional aspects of its houses. The same may be expected from the excavation of a ninth-century village on the Grothenkamp near Neumünster in Holstein, which came to light in an emergency dig undertaken in 1962.92 92 The results of this excavation are published in a periodical that is not available to me; see Hingst, 1962. Also not to be overlooked, in this connection, are three houses (one of them aisled) which A. van de Walle excavated in 1955 in the ancient town center of Antwerp in a settlement-horizon that could be dated in the eleventh century.93 93 For the houses in the ancient town center of Antwerp see, van de Walle, 1960; and idem, 1961. I reproduce in figures 321 and 322 a plan and a reconstruction of this house as proposed by van de Walle. The great importance of these settlements, together with those of Leens, Emden, and Wilhelmshaven-Hesse, is that they have helped to close the gap between, on one hand, the Iron Age houses of Ezinge, Jemgum, and Befort and, on the other, isolated medieval house sites found in Germany in such places as Wilhelmshaven-Krummer Weg (eleventh-twelfth centuries), Ramm (thirteenth century), Hungersdorf (about 1400), Hardesbüttel (thirteenth-fifthteenth centuries);94 94 For Wilhelmshaven-Krummer Weg, see Genrich, 1942; for Ramm and Hungersdorf, see Engel, 1939; for Hardesbüttel, see Wegewitz, 1950/51, and Zippelius, 1953, 33, fig. 6. and in Holland in such fourteenth-century sites as Lievelde, Waalhaven, and in Boudewijn Hartsland.95 95 For Lievelde and Waalhaven, see Hekker, 1957, 211 and 215; for Boudewijn Hartsland, see Renaud, 1955. Thus, pre- and protohistory were connected to the modern period with the story of a house type whose historical life span, it now seemed, would have to be counted by millenniums rather than by centuries. In this matter, too, the last six years have brought a sensational surprise. ELP, PARISH OF WESTERBORK, THE NETHERLANDS After Haarnagel's excavation at Jemgum (figs. 313-314), it was generally believed that the aisled hall had been traced back to the period of its earliest appearance (seventhfifth centuries B.C.). However, a Bronze Age settlement in Elp (parish of Westerbork, province Drenthe, Holland) excavated in 1960-62 by H. T. Waterbolk96 96 On the excavations of Elp see Waterbolk, 1964. disclosed that the aisled long houses of the Ezinge-Feddersen-Wierde type were in use as early as 1250 B.C. The excavation brought to light the ground plan of some thirty houses of different types belonging to a farmstead composed of a main building and about four subsidiary buildings, all of which were rebuilt on various occasions during a period of occupation that lasted from roughly 1250 to roughly 850 B.C. The main houses vary in length between 82 feet (25 m.) and 135 feet (41 m.). They are internally divided into two equal parts. In one half, which was used for living, the posts are widely spaced. In the other half, which served as stables, the interstices between the posts are smaller. Some of them are not sunk into the ground as deeply as the principal posts and therefore, probably, served as mainstays for stall partitions. I show as a typical example the ground plan of house 9 (fig. 323), which illustrates this point particularly. A similar distinction of the post interstices between living quarters and the stall sections of the house could be observed in Feddersen-Wierde (figs. 315-316), in Hodorf (fig. 307), in two Iron Age houses excavated in 1954 by P. J. R. Modderman near Deventer (Oberijssel), Holland,97 97 Modderman, 1955, 22-31; now believed to belong to a Bronze Age settlement, see Waterbolk, 1964, 108 note 7. and—although not quite as markedly—in Fochteloo (fig. 304). As in the later Iron Age houses, so in Elp, the narrow ends of the house were rounded, which suggests that the ends of the roof were hipped. The houses appear to have been entered broadside through a passage way that separated the living quarters from the section that was occupied by animals—another feature that was to become a characteristic trait of the later house tradition. Waterbolk had reason to believe that the house type of Elp already existed several centuries before the settlement of Elp was founded; and before the manuscript of his preliminary report on Elp was finished, he received the news that J. D. van der Waals had come across a Bronze Age site with an aisled house 118 feet (36 m.) long at Angeloo (Emmen). It had many features in common with the Elp houses, and, to judge from its pottery, appeared to be older than the Elp settlement.98 98 Ibid., 123 note 32. The Elp settlement was occupied by an autochthonous Bronze Age population of Holland,99 99 Ibid., 122. which may or may not be proto-Germanic. The later Iron Age sites of northwest Germany and Holland were in the territory of the Frisii, the Chauci, and the Saxons.100 100 For more details, see van Giffen, 1955, 1-13. The homeland of the Saxons was east of the river Elbe at the bottom of the Danish peninsula. Their westward move into the territory of the Frisians, around 300 A.D., seems to have led to the destruction of the settlement of Ezinge. Toward the middle of the fifth century, in several successive waves, they moved across the channel into England. YEAVERING, NORTHUMBRIA, AND CHEDDAR, SOMERSET, ENGLAND Until the summer of 1956, England, peculiarly enough, had not yielded a single house site comparable to any of the Continental finds. A small settlement, of aisled post-and-wattle houses excavated in 1946 by Gerhard Bersu on a promontory of the shore of Ramsay Bay on the Isle of Man,101 101 Bersu, 1949. was probably not an Anglo-Saxon settlement but an outpost of a Norse raiding party which was occupied only intermittently. In the summer of 1956, however, Brian Hope-Taylor came upon the site of a royal Anglo-Saxon palace of the seventh century at Old Yeavering in Northumbria (Bede's villa regalis ad Gefrin),102 102 On Yeavering, unfortunately ten years after the excavation not even a preliminary report is available. Brief notices will be found in Wilson, 1957, 148-49, and Colvin, 1963, 2-3 and 5-6. which contained the remains of no fewer than twenty-five timbered houses, most of them aisled; and in 1960-62 Philip Rahtz WARENDORF, WESTPHALIA, GERMANY 325.A EXTERIOR VIEW REDRAWN FROM WINKELMANN 325.A.1 PLAN. HOUSE 47, LEVEL A, PERIOD 4 HOUSE TYPES OF EARLY MEDIEVAL SETTLEMENTS. 650-800 A.D. [after Winkelmann, 1958, 500, fig. 5] Excavations conducted in 1951 by Wilhelm Winkelmann in Warendorf, on the south side of the Ems, brought to light traces and remains in the soil of no fewer than 186 separate buildings, which could be accurately dated by pottery and other associated artifacts. The settlement was rebuilt four or five times, in most cases—as the remains of charcoal and fired clay found in many postholes indicate—after houses of the previous settlement had been destroyed by fire. Analysis of the successive stages of the site disclosed that each inhabited level consisted of a group of four to five farmyards occupying an area of about 984 feet (100m) square. Each farmyard held a large dwelling, and fourteen to fifteen smaller auxiliary buildings (barns, stables, sheds, weaving houses). The variety of these service structures is shown in figs. 326.A-F. The reason for the boat shape of House 47, a feature very common in early Scandinavian architecture, is obscure. For other examples of longhouses of this type see below, V. 17. 3.

HOUSE 7, LEVEL A, PERIOD 1 HOUSE TYPES OF EARLY MEDIEVAL SETTLEMENTS, 650-800 A.D. [after Winkelmann, 1958, 504, fig. 8] Plans and reconstructions on these pages are typical of the man or principal dwellings of the Warendorf settlements. By virtue of both size and architectural distinction, as well as the presence of a hearth, they are unquestionably the dwellings of the owners of the land. They were boat-shaped (fig. 325.A) or of rectangular plan, as above, varying in length between 45 and 95 feet (14-29m), in width between 14½ and 32 feet (4.5-7.0m). Their roofs were supported by a perimeter of heavy posts set vertically into the ground, each buttressed from outside by a second, lighter post rising at an angle to meet the inner post near its head. The triangulation counteracted the thrust of the roof. Wall panels between vertical posts were daubed with clay. The axes of these dwellings, and most of the subsidiary structures, ran from west to east. This feature, characteristic of many pre- and protohistoric buildings in these latitudes, was apparently determined by the desire to expose only a gable wall to the prevailing (here, western) winds. The houses were entered on their long walls through two opposing entrances in midwall, each protected by a porch. The hearth lay in the eastern half of the house. WARENDORF, WESTPHALIA, GERMANY 326.A 326.B 326.C HOUSE TYPES OF EARLY MEDIEVAL SETTLEMENTS, 650-800 A.D. [redrawn after Winkelmann, 1958, 504, fig. 8] These pages give a visual account of the variety of service structures that one might have expected to find in the farmyards of Warendorf. They have been redrawn from models made under the direction of Wilhelm Winkelmann, and are on display at the Museum für Vor- und Frühgeschichte, Münster, under the aegis of which the excavations at Warendorf were conducted. There were forty service buildings of rectangular plan with vertically boarded walls at Warendorf (326.A), used as barns and stables. Small houses with hearths built in the manner of the larger dwellings presumably provided housing for serfs (326.C). Numerous small sheds with open walls (326.B) were probably utility buildings for various kinds of storage. WARENDORF, WESTPHALIA, GERMANY 326.D 326.E 326.F HOUSE TYPES OF EARLY MEDIEVAL SETTLEMENTS, 650-800 A.D. [redrawn after Winkelmann, 1958, 504, fig. 8] The small, walled rectangular shed (326.D) could have served many needs from implement storage to animal shelter. A great number of small buildings of A-frame construction (326.E) were found in the Warendorf farmyards. They were partly dug into the ground to gain standing height, and some buildings of this type were identifiable as weaving houses by the artifacts they contained. But a building with below-ground storage could have served equally well for winter storage of root crops. The polygonal framework was used to store loose hay or sheaves of grain (326.F); its conical thatched roof could slide down its poles to accommodate and adequately shelter the diminishing harvest as it was used up through the winter. The floor grid of lashed poles (326.X) afforded aeration and drainage for the hay or grain; the plans show typical posting patterns for the structures. 326.X HAYSTACK SHELTER, left, and DRYING PLATFORM, right Haystacks and aeration platforms of this type are common in Germany and the Netherlands even today. For a fine 15th-cent. portrayal, see fig. 368. 326.G WARENDORF, WESTPHALIA, GERMANY HOUSE TYPES OF EARLY MEDIEVAL SETTLEMENT, 650-800 A.D. [redrawn from Winkelmann, 1958, 500, 504] Each of the buildings shown on this and the preceding pages is referred to in the Alamannic, Bajuvarian, and Salic laws discussed above (p. 26ff), where they are designated in the following manner: The house of a free man = DOMUS or SALA LIBERI (figs. 325A-B); the house of a serf = DOMUS SERVI (fig. 326.C); a wall-enclosed barn = SCORIA (fig. 326.A); an unenclosed barn = SCOF (fig. 326.B); a granary = PARC (fig. 326.D); a haystack, or stacked sheaves of wheat = MITA (fig. 326.F). For a more complete account and the etymology of these terms see above, p. 29, notes 14-18, and the chart in Winkelmann, 1954, 210, fig. 12. unearthed at Cheddar, Somerset,103 103 For Cheddar, see the excellent preliminary report by Philip Rahtz, 1962-63, as well as a summary in Colvin, 1963, 4-5 and 907-9. another Saxon palace (sedes regalis aet Ceodre) with the remains of a timbered long hall from the time of King Alfred (871-900)104 104 A plan of this hall is shown below, p. 280, fig. 470. and an aisled hall, likewise in timber, from the reign of Henry I (1100-35), a plan of which is reproduced in figure 324. The results of these excavations once fully published will put an end to another enigmatic chapter of early medieval house research. THE SINGLE-NAVED HOUSE OF WARENDORF, NEAR MÜNSTER, WESTPHALIA, AND IN OTHER GERMAN SITES If I have given primary consideration to aisled structures in the preceding account of prehistoric and early medieval house construction, I have done so because the excavations conducted during the last three decades seem to indicate, with mounting conclusiveness, that this was the principal dwelling type used during the Iron Age and in the Early Middle Ages in the barbaric territories north of the Alps. In emphasizing this fact, I do not wish to convey the impression that it was the only one. Other excavations, recently conducted, have brought clear evidence of the existence of a simpler type of house that was not provided with any aisles. A good sampling of this latter type was brought to light between 1951 and 1954 when Wilhelm Winkelmann excavated a medieval settlement in the vicinity of Warendorf, near Münster, Westphalia.105 105 Winkelmann, 1954; and idem, 1958. The pottery found in this settlement suggested that it was occupied from about 650 to 800 A.D. The leading house type was a structure of rectangular plan, accessible by two porch-surmounted entrances facing each other in the middle of the long walls (figs. 325 A-B and below, pp. 271ff). Similar houses were encountered in Bucholtwelmen (district of Dinslaken) in 1939, in Haldern (near Wesel, Lower Rhine) in 1938, and in Westick (district of Unna, Westphalia) in 1935—the latter a rare example of Continental cruck construction.106 106 For Bucholtwelmen, see Tischler, 1940, and Rudolph, 1940; for Haldern, see von Uslar, 1949; for Westick, see Bänfer, Stieren, and Klein, 1936. Warendorf was of particular interest because on this site the principal dwellings were surrounded by an entire host of subsidiary structures of smaller dimensions and lesser significance, the like of which one would expect to encounter in all those settlements where the various domestic functions, rather than being assembled under one roof, are scattered throughout a variety of separate structures. Winkelmann has gathered all these types together in a visual chart which reads like a model book of early medieval house construction (figs. 325 and 326). He had found an equivalent for virtually each and every variant mentioned in the Alamannic, Bajuvarian, and Salic laws.107 107 See above, pp. 72-76ff. LACK OF COMPARABLE FINDS IN FRANCE AND IN THE SOUTH OF GERMANY The great shortcoming of our present knowledge of early medieval house construction in transalpine Europe is that it is based on the results of excavations confined to the Scandinavian countries and to the northern parts of Holland and Germany, with the recent addition of Anglo-Saxon England. France, to this day, has remained a terra incognita. Bursting with treasures of unsurpassable beauty created in more advanced and more sophisticated periods as well as in more permanent materials, she is unlikely to engage in the near future in any concerted search for the shadows that the rotting timbers of her humbler early medieval houses left in the subsoil underneath the stately structures that replaced them. But even in southern Germany the soil has as yet been rather unyielding. An excavation of a Frankish settlement of the sixth to ninth centuries A.D., made as early as 1937 in Gladbach (district of Neuwied),108 108 For Gladbach, see Wagner, Hussong, and Mylius, 1938. brought to light a great variety of smaller subsidiary structures, all in post-and-wattle work—but no houses of any primary significance. The same holds true for an Alamannic settlement of the Early Middle Ages, excavated in 1947 in the vicinity of Merdingen (district of Freiburg),109 109 For Merdingen, see Garscha, Hammel, Kimmig, and Schmid, 1948-50. and for a Bajuvarian early medieval village near Burgheim (district Neuburg on the Donau.)110 110 For Burgheim, see Krämer, 1951; and idem, 1951/52. The reason for this scarcity of finds on the mainland is probably very simple. The dwelling mounds of the coastal lowlands which yielded such rich information are not only conspicuous scenic landmarks, but also of a physical composition (marsh, clay, manure—sealed off by intermittent layers of silt) that offers unusually favorable conditions for the preservation of wood, an advantage that is otherwise only encountered in peat bogs or in sites that lie below the normal water level. On the mainland these conditions, in general, are wanting.111 111 Cf. Sage, 1966, 774; and for more direct visual illustration of the difference in preservation in a typical mainland site, the excavation of aisled Iron Age houses on the Gristeder Esch, conducted in 1960-61 by Dieter Zoller (Zoller, 1963). V. 3 THE ST. GALL HOUSE: ITS TYPOLOGICAL IDENTIFICATION V.3.1 PRINCIPAL FEATURES MULTIPLICITY OF FUNCTION The examples of prehistoric, protohistoric, and early medieval timber houses reviewed on the preceding pages prove the existence of a tradition of aisled houses in the Germanic territories of transalpine Europe whose functional organization bears a striking resemblance to that of the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall. The most conspicuous trait of this house is its multiplicity of functions. It is a structure which, by simple shifts of assignment, may be used exclusively for the accommodation of human beings, as quarters for humans and animals combined, or simply as storage space for the harvest. It is a house that can carry out all these functions simultaneously, alternatingly, or interchangeably—without sustaining the slightest basic modification. Van Giffen's excavation of the Iron Age Warf of Ezinge has shown that this multi-purpose function was already clearly established by the third century B.C. in the cluster settlement of layer V (figs. 295-297) of this important site. RELATION OF MAIN ROOM TO PERIPHERAL ROOMS A second conspicuous typological trait that the St. Gall house has in common with the northern all-purpose house is that both have as their principal architectural component a large rectangular center space, containing the hearth, which serves as the common living, cooking, and dining room. The more specialized functions, such as sleeping and stabling of livestock, are relegated to the narrow spaces ranged peripherally around it. Thus in the House for Distinguished Guests (fig. 397) the center space is used as the "dining hall" of the guests (domus hospit? ad prandendum), the chambers on the two narrow sides of the house as "heatable rooms with beds" (caminatae cum lectis), while the rooms that are attached to the two long sides of the center hall serve as servants' quarters (cubilia seruitorum) and as "stables for the horses" (stabula cabballoarum). In the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers (fig. 392) the center space is designated for use as a "hall for the pilgrims and paupers" (domus peregrinorum &amp; pauperu?m), while the outer rooms serve as quarters for the servants (seruientium mansiones), as "supply room" (camera), and as "cellar" (cellarium). In the House of the Physicians (fig. 410) the center space is designated as the room of the physicians (domus medicorum), while the peripheral rooms are described 327. EZINGE (GRONINGEN), THE NETHERLANDS HOUSE B OF WARF-LAYER V, 3rd CENT. B.C. [redrawn after Van Giffen, 1936, Beilage 26B] For a plan and perspective reconstruction of the entire settlement of which this house is a part see figs. 295-296; for a reconstruction of the interior of this house, fig. 297, and above, 49ff. as the ward for those who are critically ill (cubiculum ualde infirmorum), the quarters of the chief physician (mansio medici ipsius), and the pharmaceutical supply room (armarium pigmentorum). Again in the House for Servants of Outlying Estates and for Servants Traveling with the Emperor's Court (fig. 402), the House for the Fowlkeeper and his crew (fig. 466), as well as all the buildings that accommodate livestock and their attendants, except that for the goats, viz., the sheep (fig. 493), the swine (fig. 491), cows (fig. 483), foaling mares (fig. 487), and their keepers, the hearth room in the center is designated as the room for the servants (dom' familiae); the common room (domus communis); the main room (ipsa domum); the room for the swineherds (domus porcariorum), the room for the cowherds (domus armentariorum); and the room of the horse grooms (domus equaritiae), respectively—all in the sense of a common living or gathering room. The outer spaces serve as "sleeping quarters" for the attendant serfs, shepherds, goathers, and swineherds (cubilia custodienti?, cubilia opilionum, cubilia pastorum) and of course as "stables" for the various species of animals (cauil, stabula). In order to be taken to their stalls the animals had to be led through the common center room of their keepers. This holds true not only for buildings specifically devised for the purpose of housing livestock but also for buildings of such a highly residential nature as the House for Distinguished Guests, where the horses, in order to reach their stables, had to be guided through the common dining room around the central fire-place, precisely as in the Iron Age houses of Ezinge, Holland. I draw special attention to House B of layer V of the Ezinge Warf, which dates from third century B.C. (fig. 327), because its shape and general proportions are very similar to those of the St. Gall house. Its doors are in the long sides facing each other across the house. The hearth is in the middle of the center aisle. The animals stand in the outer aisles, facing the walls—one of them so close to the hearth that its tail could have fanned the fire. The traffic pattern is the same: people as well as animals enter the central hall by crossing one of the aisles and then move to peripheral spaces reserved for feeding, retreat, or sleep. OPEN FIRE &amp; SMOKE-HOLE CALL FOR A HOUSE OPEN TO RIDGE OF ROOF A third important feature that the St. Gall house shares with the timbered Germanic all-purpose house is that both are ground-floor structures. The open fire (locus foci) that burns in the middle of center floor and the smoke hole (testu) in the roof above preclude the partition of the inner space by the insertion of floors or ceilings (figs. 396 and 392). Of all the buildings that can be classified as guest and service structures, only one has an upper story, viz., the House for Horses and Oxen (see fig. 474). But there the draftsman makes sure by the inscription, supra tabulatum, that it is clearly understood that the space above the stables for the horses and oxen is taken up by a hayloft. In the other guest and service buildings no mention is made of an upper level. This, in the language of the drafter of the Plan, can only mean that there were no upper levels.1 1 Cf. I, pp. 59-61. A last conspicuous trait of this house type is that it was in general not provided with windows but received its light from an opening in the roof which also served as smoke outlet. We shall return to this point in more detail below. Considering these distinctive similarities, the conclusion is inescapable that the St. Gall house is a variant of the Germanic all-purpose house discussed in the preceding pages. There are some differences, to be sure, but they are not of a kind that would weaken this conclusion or force us to qualify it in any essential point. V.3.2 PLACEMENT OF ENTRANCE In the excavated Germanic all-purpose houses there appears to be considerable variability in the location of the entrances. The houses of the Plan of St. Gall, by contrast, show a definite bias in favor of lateral accessibility. Only in two out of thirty-one guest and service buildings do the entrance or entrances lie in the end walls, the House of the Fowlkeeper and his crew and the large anonymous building in the western tract of the monastery. In all the others the principal entrance is in the middle of one of the long walls and it is balanced in the opposite side of the house by an exit giving access to a privy. Facing each other in opposite pairs, the entrance and exit give the structure a transverse axis running at right angles to the basic longitudinal orientation of the house. This is by no means a singular property of the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall, and I must refute my critics at this point for having suggested that I have derived an "essentially central type" house from one that is organized in an "essentially axial or longitudinal manner."2 2 The theories here advanced were first expressed by me in a public address delivered during the International Symposium held in St. Gall in the summer of 1957. They were subsequently dealt with briefly in my article, "On the Origins of the Mediaeval Bay System," 1958, 5-8. The criticism here referred to was first voiced by Otto Doppelfeld in discussion, and subsequently put into print by Erwin Poeschel (Poeschel, 1957; and idem, in Studien, 1962, 31-32) and Reinhardt (Reinhardt, in Studien, 1962, 64). V.3.3 CENTRALITY VS AXIALITY A CONTROVERSIAL ISSUE Broadside accessibility is as old as the type itself, and, in fact, one of the very earliest of the aisled Iron Age houses so far known, that of Jemgum (fig. 314), is entered through two porches that face each other in opposite pairs in the middle of the two long walls. Broadside accessibility is a characteristic feature not only of many of the smaller Ezinge houses (figs. 293-297), it is a standard form of the houses, both small and long, of Fochteloo (fig. 304) and Feddersen-Wierde (figs. 315-316). It is the standard form of most of the Iron Age houses of Denmark,3 3 Besides the example reproduced in fig. 276 above, see Gudmund Hatt's review of the Danish material (Hatt, 1937) as well as the results of his excavation of the Early Iron Age village of Nørre Fjand (Hatt, 1957). a common occurrence among the Migration Time houses of Öland4 4 For Márten Stenberger's review of the Öland material, see Stenberger, 1933. and Norway5 5 The Norwegian material excavated prior to 1942 is summarized by Sigurd Grieg, in Grieg, 1942. as well as among the Saga period houses of Iceland6 6 For Iceland, see the account of the excavations conducted in 1939 by a combined team of Icelandic, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Finnish anthropologists, edited by Márten Stenberger, in Stenberger, 1943. and Greenland.7 7 For Greenland, see Aage Roussel's account, in Roussel, 1941. EFFECT OF SEATING ARRANGEMENT As there is some lack of clarity about the distribution of the house type, often too loosely referred to as the Northern "longhouse," I must digress at this point to discuss its relationship to the aisled Germanic timber house in general, and to the St. Gall house in particular. In certain North Germanic territories, especially on the island of Gotland, the house entrance is located preferentially in one of the end walls.8 8 In the Migration Period village of Vallhagar, on Gotland, which comprised a total of twenty-four houses, all the houses are entered through the end walls, like the hall of Lojsta (fig. 291); see Vallhagar, ed. Stenberger, 1955. I have for some time suspected that this axial location of the entrance is historically conditioned by the customary seating arrangement in the North, which reserves for the owner of the dwelling a "high seat" (hásæti or œdra öndvegi) in the middle of the long bench on one side of the house, and for the person next in rank the "second best seat of honor" (úœdra öndvegi) in the middle of the long bench on the opposite side, with the fire flickering in the center floor between them.9 9 Cf. above, p. 23, and below, pp. 80-81. In the North Germanic territories of Öland, Norway, and Iceland, when the entrance is found in one of the long walls, it is rarely located in the middle of the house but usually down toward the ends of the hall where it would not be in conflict with such a seating arrangement. The prevalence of this seating order in the North is incontrovertibly established by the Sagas through scores of descriptions of banquets and wedding parties, some so detailed that we can reconstruct the individual place of seating of almost everyone attending. Since the same custom prescribes that the women be seated on the cross bench at the upper end of the hall, the most logical place remaining for the entrance is in the end wall on the opposite side of the house (provided this side of the house is not used for cattle, in which case an axial door might be installed at either end of the house, one for the cattle, the other as the entrance for the farmer and his family). There is no doubt that houses laid out in this manner have a longitudinal character.10 10 I mention as typical examples houses 11 and 18 of Vallhagar; see Vallhagar, ed. cit., 170ff, 213ff. This feature of the house, however, is greatly overemphasized, when the structure is deprived of all its furnishings and inner cross partitions, as it is upon excavation. Had we actually been able to witness one of these banquets, we would have found that even with the strictly axial arrangement of the hall, the longitudinal sway of the space was intercepted in three crucial areas by strong transverse alignments. The first of these was the axis formed by the two high seats and the fireplace. It divided the hall at its center (or close to it) into two halves, the outer half nearest the door being the place for guests of lesser standing, the inner half for the guests of higher standing; and internally in each of these groups the more important men were seated closer to the high seats, the less important further outward toward both ends of the hall. Two further transverse alignments were established at each end of the hall by the installation in the innermost bay of the hall of a cross bench (þverpallir) on which the women sat, and by the use of the entrance bay as a vestibule or 328. GIZUR'S STOFA AT FLUGUMYR. ORDER OF SEATING The narrative on which this reconstruction is based deserves particular attention, since it was committed to writing by one of its main participants, Sturla Thordasson, who recorded it before 1262, when most of those who had attended the wedding still lived. It is a fine example of the veracity of the Old Norse narrative tradition, demonstrating that in a hall 78 feet long and 36 feet wide (26 by 12 ells) the nearly 200 invited guests could be seated comfortably in the manner described in the Saga. The wedding of Sturla's daughter Ingibjörg (only 13 years of age) and Hall, son of Gizur Thorvaldsson, had been arranged in formal acknowledgement of a peace settlement among Sturla, Gizur, and Rafn, formerly enemies. But the peace was violated two nights after the wedding by yet another enemy who, unappeased, mounted a surprise attack on Flugumyr, in the course of which Gizur's family was burned to death in a fire that devastated his entire farmstead. Gizur alone survived, although nearly frozen to death, by submerging his body in a vat of milk, and recovered quickly to take gruesome revenge. (Extracts and translations from the Old Norse text follow.) Nú líðr at brúðlaups-stefnu; ríða þeir Hrafn ok Sturia [vestan] við sjau tigi manna; þeir höfðu gótt mannval. Með þeim var Fell-Snorri prestr, Vigfúss Gunnsteinsson, Þorleifr Fagrdæll, ok mart annarra góðra manna. Ekki er frá ferð at segja fyrr en þeir kómu Föstu-kveldit it síðasta í sumri í Skagafjörð. Tók Hrafn gisting á Víðimýri ok þeir tíu saman. . . . Sturla gisti á Reykjarhóli; var þar [með hónum] Helga, kona hans, ok Ingibjörg dóttir hennar, ok [þau] fimtán saman. Þá var skipt [liði] á aðra bæi. Now the day of the wedding drew near. Rafn and Sturla rode from the west with seventy men. They had a well-chosen following. With them came Priest Snorri from Fell, Vigfuss Gunnsteinsson, Thorleif from Fagridal, and many another respected man. Of their journey there is nothing to tell before they came, on the last Friday evening of summer, to Skagafjord. Rafn quartered with nine others in Vidimyr. . . . Sturlo passed the night in Reykjarhol; there with him were Helga his wife, Ingibjörg his daughter, and thirteen others. His men were quartered at other farmsteads. * Gizurr hafði boðit mörgum bóndum um Skagafjörð ok svá ór Eyjafirði; . . . Þorvarðr ór Saurbæ fór norðan, ok Guðmundr frá Hrafna-gili; ok þeir feðgar ór Mikla-garði, Þorvarðr ok Örnólfr son hans; ok enn fleiri bændr norðan. Sunnan kom Isleifr Gizurarson, ok Ketilbjörn, ok kom hann fyrst. Sámr Magnússon ok Ámundi, ok þeir tiu. Á öðru hundraði var boðs-manna Gizurar. . . . Gizur had invited many farmers from around Skagafjord and likewise many from Eyafjord; . . . out of the north came Thorvard of Saurbae, Gudmund from Rafnagil; Thorvard of Mikligard with Örnulf his son, and numerous other northern farmers. From the south came Gizur's sons Isleif and Ketilbjörn (the last first), Sam Magnusson, Amundi and six others. Close to two hundred were Gizur's guests. . . . * Nú kómu menn til brúðlaupsins Laugar-kveldit á Flugumýri. Þar var sú mannaskipan, at Gizurr sat á inn eystra langbekk miðjan, ok Hrafn innar† † Innar, away from the hall entrance, i.e., toward the cross bench. frá hónum it næsta; þá föru-nautar hans ok félagar innar frá hónum.

Á hinn vestra bekk miðjan sat Sturla; innar frá hónum Snorri prestr; útar frá hónum Vigfúss Gunnsteinsson. Forsæti vóru fyrir endilöngum bekk hvárum-tveggja.

Ok er mönnum var í sæti skipat, vóru log upp dregin í stofunni. Ok því næst stóð Gizurr upp. . . Now the guests came to the wedding on Saturday in Flugumyr. This was the order of seating: Gizur sat in the middle of the eastern long bench, and Rafn next to him on the inward side† † Innar, away from the hall entrance, i.e., toward the cross bench. and thereafter Rafn's companions and kinsmen. On the outward side‡ ‡ Útar, toward the entrance end of the hall. next to Gizur sat his son Hall the bridegroom, then Isleif, Hall's brother, then Thor the Dwarf, Arndor's son, then Sam, then Thorvard of Saurbae, then the men of Eyafjord. In the middle of the west bench sat Sturla, next to him on the inward side Priest Snorri, on his outward side Vigfuss Gunnsteinsson. Fore chairs were set all down the two long benches. And church stools were set in the center floor, and there men were seated in two rows. Ketilbjörn, Gizur's son, sat next to the cross bench, and by him on stools the sons of Brand Kolbein, Kalf and Thorgeir, facing the bench where Gizur sat. And after each man had his proper seat, lights were borne into the hall. Then Gizur stood up [and spoke]. . . * Eptir þat vóru borð upp tekin um alla stufuna ok ljós tendruð. Stofan var sex álna ok tuttugu löng, en tólf álna breið. Sex-fallt var setið í stofunni. Ok er menn höfðu matask um hríð, kom innar skenkr í stofuna, átta menn fyrir hvern bekk. Þorleifr hreimr var fyrir þeim. Fjórir menn skenkðu konum, ok gengu allir með hornum. Var þar drukkit fast þegar um kveldit, bæði mjöðr ok mungát. After that tables were set up in the whole hall and the lights lit. The hall was 26 ells long and 12 ells wide. In six rows the people were seated. And after they had eaten awhile, drink was brought in, eight men before each bench. Thorleif the Screecher was at their head. Four men served the women drink, and all came and went with drinking-horns. There was much drinking that first evening both of mead and of beer. NOTES: These passages are translated from the Icelandic of G. Vigfusson's edition of The Sturlunga Saga (Oxford, 1878), with occasional reference to W. Baetke's translation of it into German (Düsseldorf and Cologne, 1967). The routes taken by the riders to the wedding can still be traced, for the present-day map of Iceland contains, with almost no alteration, names of all the towns and districts mentioned by Sturla Thordasson in his narrative. Writing in 1262, Sturla used the 36-inch ell to state the dimensions of the hall at Flugumyr. Only six years earlier (and four years after the wedding itself) the ell, by official decree, had been doubled to bring it into conformity with measure used abroad and encountered frequently by Icelandic traders (see III, Glossary, s.v.). forehall (forstofa), often separated from the main hall by a boarded cross partition (þverþili). Thus, three sides of the house were occupied by tables and benches running in U-formation around the center space, while the bay on the entrance side of the house acted as a buffer zone between the center space and the outer doors. Even in its purest form the North Germanic long house had a definite "central touch"; and the peripheral or circumferential quality of the surrounding spaces was further stressed by two constructional features of paramount importance in the aesthetic appearance of the house. First: The aisles and cross bench were raised, in general, above the level of the center floor.11 11 Cf. Gudmundsson's reconstruction of the Saga house, above, fig. 284; and as a typical example of an excavated hall house, Stöng in Þorsardalur Valley, on Iceland, above, fig. 292. Second: the roof over the two terminal bays of the house was usually hipped.12 12 As far as the hipped roof is concerned, cf. not only the evidence discussed above on pp. 53ff, but also the arguments adduced in Rolf Lundström's interesting chapter, "Some Technical Aspects of the Construction of the Vallhagar Buildings" (Vallhagar, ed. cit., II, 1033-47). I quote as a typical example of this arrangement an account of a wedding banquet held at Flugumyr in the winter of 1253,13 13 Sturlunga Saga, ed. Vigfusson, II, 1878, 157-59; Baetke, 1930, 301-3. For the date, see Baetke's chronological table, ibid., 354. which is so detailed and accurate that the entire scene can be reconstructed on the drafting board (figs. 328). The tale reflects customs of seating many centuries old.14 14 Cf. the account of the order of seating at Gunnar's wedding with Hallgerda at Lithend in 974, Brennu-Njalsaga, ed. Jonsson, 1908, 75ff, and The Story of Burnt Njal, ed. Dasent, 1911, 57ff. For the date, see the chronological table published in Dasent's edition of 1900, xxxix-xli. Sturla Thordasson, who participated in this event, describes it as follows: On Saturday now the guests arrived for the wedding. The seating arrangement was such that Gizur sat in the middle of the eastern long bench [in eystra langbekk mi?jan]. Inside, away from Gizur and next to him [innar frá honum it næsta] sat Rafn and then came Rafn's companions and kinsmen. Outside, away from Gizur and next to him [útar frá Gizur it næsta], sat his son Hall, the bridegroom, then Isleif his brother, then Thorir Dwarf, the son of Andor, then Sam, then Thorvard from Saurbae and the men from Eyafjord. In the middle of the western long bench [á hin vestra bekk mi?jan] sat Sturla, and on the inside away from him [innar frá honum] Snorri the Priest; and on the outside away from him [útar frá honum] Vigfuss Gunsteinsson. And lengthwise all along the two benches there were forechairs [forsæti] and all along the center aisle [eptir mi?ju golfinu] church stools [kirkjustólar] were set up on which people sat in two rows. Gizur's son Ketilbjorn sat on a stool inward against the cross bench [á stóli innar vid pall] and next to him the sons of Brand Kolbein, Kalf and Thorgeir, who faced the bench on which Gizur sat. . . . The dining hall was 26 ells long and 12 ells broad, and people sat there in six rows [Stofan var sex alna ok tottugu löng, en tolf alna brei?. Sex fallt var seti? i stofunni].15 15 The old Icelandic ell of 18 inches was increased to 36 inches ca. 1200 A.D. See Cleasby-Vigfusson, 1957, s.v. alin, and III, Glossary, s.v. ell. The order of seating of the women is not described in this account, but, to judge by many other comparable accounts, they can only have sat on the cross bench. The house was also provided with space to store the tables and utensils. This we learn incidentally in the account of the surprise attack on Flugumyr, undertaken two nights after the wedding banquet. We are told how "a laborer by the name of Paul dies in the table-utensils chamber in the stofa." The only place such a utensils chamber could have been was at the entrance side of the hall. DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES There is, nevertheless, a distinct difference between the seating arrangement of the house of a North Germanic chieftain of the Saga period and that of the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall. In the North the benches and tables were set up in the aisles of the house; the center floor was primarily a passageway and could therefore be kept relatively narrow. The setting up at Flugumyr of special forestools on the inner side of the aisles, and of the even more special rows of church seats on the center floor, was an unusual arrangement conditioned by the gathering of an exceptionally large number of guests attending the wedding. In the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall, by contrast, the benches and tables are set up in the center space itself. The floor plan of the House for Distinguished Guests, the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers, and the House for Horses and Oxen leaves no doubt on this point. They have benches—or benches and tables—all along the walls of the center space. The outer spaces serve as bedrooms, dormitories, or stables. In the house of the North Germanic chieftain, at the height of the Saga period, the functions of dining and sleeping were often relegated to separate buildings, a dining or festal hall (veizluskáli) and a sleeping hall (hviluskáli), one lying in prolongation of the axis of the other, the whole assuming the aspect of a "long house." In the St. Gall house, on the other hand, all these functions are combined in one building. The use of the central hall as dining room necessitates a substantial enlargement of this space, as well as the introduction of separating wall partitions to safeguard the integrity of the respective functions of eating and sleeping. Both these innovations tend to strengthen the "central" character of the house. Yet it should not be forgotten that when Iceland was settled by immigrants from Norway at the end of the ninth century, the North Germanic house in use there was an all-purpose structure combining living, cooking, and sleeping under one roof.16 16 See Gudmundsson, 1889, 207-8. This is the case in most of the Germanic houses of the Iron Age and continued to be so on farmsteads of modest size, even in the Saga period. The long house previously referred to was a very special type, heralded in by the emergence of powerful chieftains in a society that had formerly been characterized by its egalitarian structure. CONCLUSIONS It is possible that the controversy about the "predominantly central character" of the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall versus the "predominantly axial or longitudinal character" of the Germanic long house (in which I found myself involved even before I had an opportunity to commit my ideas to print) has its origin in an overevaluation of the frequency of occurrence of the latter. The Germanic long house is only one among a great variety of other aisled Germanic houses whose layouts range from the short and stubby houses of Jemgum (figs. 313-314) and Ezinge (figs. 293 to 297) through all degrees of elongation to the spectacular extreme of Känne Burs, Sweden, which had the unbelievable length of 203 feet (62 m., cf. above, fig. 290). But these excessive forms are neither very common nor very typical; and when they are part of a larger settlement they are usually interspersed with a variety of shorter houses. The excavations of Ezinge, Fochteloo, and Feddersen-Wierde, moreover, have shown that on the Continent it was the care of animals rather than shelter for humans which tended to extend the house along its longitudinal axis. The largest house of Ezinge was a cattle barn (fig. 298). And of the longest houses of Fochteloo (fig. 304) and Feddersen-Wierde (fig. 316), only one fifth are reserved for people; the rest sheltered the cattle. On the Plan of St. Gall, too, the longest house is one that serves as shelter for animals (House for the Horses and Oxen, fig. 474; cf. below, pp. 271-79). The excavations of Ezinge, Fochteloo, and many other places teach us, in addition, that where animals and people are housed in separate structures, or where the animals associated with the people are few, the houses remain small and squarish. It is from the tradition of this shorter variety of houses that the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall will have to be derived. The houses of St. Gall, following this tradition, are entered broadside; the length of the house exceeds its width by an appreciable, but rarely excessive, margin; the center space of the house amounts in width to about twice that of the aisles; and the hipped roofs over the narrow ends in conjunction with the broadside entrance must have given the house, despite its basic axial orientation, a strongly centralized character. In giving preference to the shorter variant, the author of the Plan of St. Gall still remained entirely within the range of possibilities offered by his own indigenous tradition. Had it been the custom to house the monks together with the cattle, this might have led, even on the Plan of St. Gall, to the introduction of long houses rather than the shorter or more centralized type. But the life of the monastery represented on this Plan is based on the principle of functional separation. The monks were the lords of the estate, the leisure class, whose spiritual obligation postulated that they be freed from at least the meanest agricultural chores, which were left to serfs and herdsmen. Even among those caring for the animals a high degree of specialization had brought about a systematic separation of 329. PLAN OF ST. GALL HOUSE WITH BASIC FORM: MAIN SPACE WITH NO PERIPHERAL SPACES SCALE 1/16 INCH = 1 FOOT [1:192] ON VERTICAL EDGE A The simplest spatial form among the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall is an internally undivided room with an open fireplace and no other rooms at the sides or around it. In the example here shown, the Bath house and Kitchen of the Novitiate two such basic forms are joined under the same roof. On the Plan such buildings are never used as dwellings but only for subsidiary functions such as cooking and bathing. Its purest form is found in the Monks' Kitchen (fig. 211). In buildings that are used as dwellings the need for privacy or storage is met by the addition of an aisle or a lean-to. In the example shown in fig. 330, the Annex of the Great Collective workshop the three large square rooms which form the principal space of the house serve as workshops for the goldsmith, blacksmith and fullers. The aisles or lean-to's at the rear of the building are their bedrooms. the various species. There is a special house for horses and oxen, for foaling mares, and for dairy cows, pigs, sheep and goats. On the Plan of St. Gall the houses for the livestock are no longer simply an axial extension of the house of the farmer and his family; they are entities of their own, within which a small area of space is set aside to serve as sleeping quarters for the herdsmen. There are other distinctive differences that herald a new development. In some of the guest and service structures there are, in addition to the central fireplace, one or several other heating devices installed in the peripheral rooms. About this we shall have to say more below. V. 4 CRITERIA OF RECONSTRUCTION I V.4.1 GENERAL SPATIAL COMPOSITION, Having identified the historical building tradition to which the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall belong, we can now designate as a central hall the large rectangular center space, which is common to all of its variants and which is open to the roof and furnished with a fireplace supplying the house with its warmth. The subsidiary outer spaces, on the other hand, must be interpreted as aisles or lean-to's added peripherally to one, two, three, or all four sides of the hall. This suggests a variety of elevations, the basic possibilities of which are illustrated in figures 329-334. In its simplest form the house is covered by a pitched roof with gable walls on the narrow sides. Typical examples of this basic form are the bath and kitchen houses of the Novitiate and the Infirmary (fig. 329), consisting really of two such spaces added one to the other. In the next stage, an aisle is added to one side, necessitating a roof extension over the aisle addition, as in the Annex to the Great Collective Workshop (fig. 330). In the third stage, a second aisle is added to the opposite side, requiring a roof extension over this second aisle, as in the House of the Fowlkeeper (fig. 331). In the fourth stage, the main space is surrounded on three sides by peripheral spaces. This permits two variants: in one of these one of the narrow sides of the center space remains exposed and contains the entrance, as in the House of the Physicians (fig. 332); in the other, this function is performed by one of the long sides, as in the Gardener's House (fig. 333). The roof over the lean-to, on the narrow side of these houses, could either be a simple extension of the aisle roofs with the upper portion of the gable walls exposed, or it could be slanted up to the ridge of the roof in the form of a hip, a constructionally superior form (and in the case of larger houses almost a necessity) because the rafters of the lean-to act as buttresses protecting the main roof against longitudinal displacement. We have demonstrated the first possibility in some of the smaller houses, such as the House of the Physicians (fig. 332) and the Gardener's House (fig. 333), but have adopted the latter version for all of the larger houses of the Plan. The range of the variants is complete with the addition of another aisle or lean-to on the fourth side of the center space (fig. 334). Thus the house attained the distinctive silhouette so well known from drawings and engravings of rural landscapes by Albrecht Dürer (fig. 335) and Peter Bruegel the Elder (fig. 336). 330. PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE VARIANT I MAIN SPACE WITH AISLE ADDED TO ONE SIDE see caption for fig. 329 V.4.2 SUPPORTING FRAME OF TIMBER AND WALLS The crucial constructional trait of the building tradition to which the guest and service structures of the Plan of St. Gall belong is that in this family of houses the roof received its main support from two rows of freestanding wooden posts, which divided the building lengthwise into a nave and two accompanying aisles. The rafters of the roof had their footing in a course of horizontal logs (plates) which were held in place by a peripheral row of outer posts, shorter and not as sturdy as the principal posts. The walls had, in general, no load-bearing function, and were often entirely independent from the outer posts. The predominant material was wattlework, daubed with clay or animal manure, but there is also clear evidence for vertical and horizontal weatherboarding. We show as a typical example of the former a reconstruction of House III of the ninth-century fortified settlement of Husterknupp in the lower reaches of the river Rhine (fig. 337),1 1 For Husterknupp, see Zippelius in Herrnbrodt, Bonner Jährbucher, 1958, 123-200. and as an example of the second, a reconstruction of a house of the Stellerburg in Dithmarschen, Germany (fig. 338)2 2 For Stellerburg, see Rudolph, 1942, pls. 5-8. —both dating from the ninth century. Walls built of earth or turves, as they were sporadically encountered by van Giffen both in Iron Age houses and in the early Middle Ages,3 3 See above, p. 57 and fig. 305A-C. are possible, yet not very likely, in the sophisticated context of a paradigmatic Carolingian monastery. Log construction is rare, practically nonexistent, in the time and the territories with which we PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE, VARIANT 2 331. 332. VARIANT 3A When space required for such functions as sleeping or storage exceeds the capacity of one aisle, two aisles are added to the main space, usually on the longer sides. Purest form: House of the Fowlkeeper and his Crew (fig. 231 and 446). Were this measure insufficient, peripheral spaces could be added on three sides. This permits for two solutions depending on whether the entrance is placed into the middle of one of the short sides of the principal space (as in fig. 332) or in one of its long sides (as in fig. 333). are concerned.4 4 Cf. the remarks made on this subject above, p. 17. If in our reconstruction of the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall we have decided on daubed wattlework in preference to other solutions, we have done so not only because the excavations show it to be the most common method of building walls in early medieval and protohistoric times—(it might be recalled in this context that the German word for wall, Wand, comes from winden, "to wind" or "to braid")—but also because it is still today in vast areas of central and western Europe the preferred method of constructing infillings for the walls of timber framed houses. Since in the majority of the St. Gall houses the central hearth is the only available source of heat for the entire building, the peripheral spaces cannot have been completely screened off from the central hall of the house. Like the Bajuvarian standard house (fig. 289),5 5 Cf. above, pp. 127ff. the St. Gall house was still essentially a unitary structure. In some houses, however, where there are special corner fireplaces installed in peripheral rooms the separation could have been more rigid.6 6 Cf. below, pp. 123ff. While the literary and archaeological parallels adduced in the preceding chapter leave no doubt that the traditional material used in the family of houses to which the guest and service structures of the Plan of St. Gall belong was timber, masonry construction cannot be entirely excluded. The foundations from which the timbers rose, and in certain cases even the walls or certain component parts of the walls, may have been built in stone. This would have been especially desirable for the sake of fire protection in houses which, in addition to the central hearth, had corner fireplaces in some of their peripheral rooms. The House for Distinguished Guests and the House for Bloodletting with four corner fireplaces each are first in line for such consideration (see below, figs. 397 and 416). Other houses may have been built in a mixed technique, such as the House of the Physicians (fig. 410), where the safety of the rooms with corner fireplaces may have called for masonry walls, while the gable wall on the entrance side of the house could have been timber-framed. We have reconstructed the House of the Physicians in this manner in order to demonstrate this possibility (figs. 413A-F). By no means, however, should masonry walls be taken as a precondition for the presence of corner fireplaces. Central and Northern Europe, as well as England, are dotted even today with houses built entirely of timber and yet equipped with wall and corner fireplaces built in masonry. A striking historical example of this combination is found in the February page of the Très Riches Heures of the Duc de Berry (fig. 378). We demonstrate this possibility in our reconstruction of the Gardener's House (fig. 427). For the remainder, and this holds 333. HOUSE FOR BROOD MARES, FOALS AND THEIR KEEPERS HOUSE FOR COWS AND COWHERDS 334. HOUSE () FOR SHEEPS &amp; SHEPHERDS/COWS &amp; COWHERDS/ SWINE &amp; SWINEHERDS/SERVANTS OF EMPEROR OR NOBLES The most complex and most accomplished of the guest and service buildings has its center space surrounded on all four sides by peripheral spaces (fig. 334). Whenever this solution obtains, the center space serves as common living room, while the outer spaces are used for sleeping, stabling animals, or for storage. Prime examples: Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers (fig. 392), House for Distinguished Guests (fig. 396), Outer School (fig. 407) and the majority of the houses for livestock and their keepers (fig. 489, 491, 493). true especially for all the houses that shelter animals and their keepers, there is no need to consider anything else but timber. The Brevium exempla have taught us7 7 Cf. above, pp. 36ff. that even on the highest social level in the emperor's residencies on his various estates, stone was the exceptional, timber the commonly used, material. V.4.3 UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE ROOF Up to this point, we are on relatively safe ground. The problem becomes more delicate as we turn from the supporting members of the roof to the design of the roof itself. Admittedly all the material evidence that has been brought to light so far remains confined to those portions of the building which stuck in the ground or reached vertically from the floor level of the excavated house to an optimal height of about 5 to 6 feet—as much as was buried in the mound of earth and manure that was heaped upon the floor of an abandoned house when a settlement had to be reconstructed on higher ground because of the rising water level. The roofs that lay above this survival level have vanished entirely and so far no one has been lucky enough to find a portion sufficiently large and sufficiently well preserved to obtain some real assurance of the detail of its constructional make-up. It is quite obvious that the two rows of freestanding inner posts must have been connected lengthwise and crosswise by means of plates and tie beams. Without such connections the supporting frame could not have withstood the load and thrust of the roof, and especially not in those cases where the post stood not in the ground but on stones or masonry bases8 8 Cf. above, pp. 58ff. —but whether the crossbeams lay beneath the longitudinal timbers or above them must remain conjecture. Wholly inexplicable, on the basis of the archaeological material available at this date, is the design of the roof itself. Fortunately, however, this gap in the surviving body of material evidence can be closed by the architectural historian of the Middle Ages, who can adduce as supplementary evidence the record of a group of aisled medieval halls and barns in timber whose roofs survive. 335. ALBRECHT DÜRER. THE VILLAGE OF KALKREUTH WATERCOLOR. CA. 1500, KUNSTHALLE, BREMEN BY COURTESY OF THE KUNSTHALLE, BREMEN ORIGINAL 31.4CM WIDE, 21.6 CM HIGH Most of the rural architecture of medieval Germany and the medieval Lowlands was destroyed in the ravages of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) but its visual likeness and setting was recorded before that holocaust with great descriptive accuracy in superb watercolors by Dürer (1471-1528), and in engravings after Peter Breugel the Elder (1525?-1569). Settlements such as Kalkreuth, and the unnamed Dutch village shown at the right were, as architectural concepts and by their practical function of virtually the same cast as the hamlet of Ezinge, itself some 1800-1900 years their elder, a reconstruction of which is shown in figure 295. In all these settlements some of the houses were used to store the harvest, others for the accommodation under one roof of man and beasts. The earliest surviving structures of this type date from the end of the fifteenth century, but the tradition remained unbroken. The Dutch and German Lowlands are replete with buildings dating from the 17th and 18th centuries in which the former and his family live and sleep, even today, under the same roof with the cattle and the harvest—hardly differing in some respects from the way their ancestors had done in the medieval and protohistoric buildings discussed on p. 23ff. Jan Jans's Landelijke Bouwkunst in Oost-Nederland, Enschede, 1967, is a fine record of this building tradition and a masterpiece of architectural drafting. Das Bauernhaus im Deutschen Reich und seinem Grenzgebiete, 1906 (Verband Deutscher Architekten und Ingenieurvereine) is a primary source for study of rural architecture in Germany. Helm, Das Bauernhaus im Gebiet der freien Reichstadt Nurnberg, Berlin, 1940, has good architectural analysis of the south German material. 336. ENGRAVING AFTER PETER BRUEGEL THE ELDER.

V. 5 SURVIVING MEDIEVAL HOUSES OF THE TYPE OF ST. GALL V.5.1 EARLY EXAMPLES The earliest extant medieval timber halls with aisles are the hall of the castle of Leicester (fig. 339)1 1 For the hall of Leicester Castle, see Horn, 1958, 8-9; and the literature cited below, n.6. and the hall of the bishop's palace at Hereford2 2 For the hall of the Bishop's Palace at Hereford, see Horn, ibid., 9-10; and Jones and Smith, 1960. (fig. 340), both from around 1150. They are of vital importance historically because they demonstrate that even as late as the twelfth century the aisled Germanic all-purpose house with its open central hearth and two inner rows of freestanding roof-supporting posts was still a favorite form for the representative great halls of the feudal lords of England. That they represented the norm rather than the exception may be inferred from the remains of other halls of like construction3 3 The remains of twelfth-century halls of identical floor plan have been found in Farnham Castle, Hertford Castle, and at Clarendon Palace. For Farnham, see Victoria History of the Counties of England, Surrey, II, 1905, 599-605; and Rait, 1910, 125ff. For Hertford, see Victoria History of the Counties of England, Hertfordshire III, 1912, 501-506; and Clapham and Godfrey, 1913, 141-50. For Clarendon Palace, see Borenius and Charlton, 1936. The prototype for all these halls was the Great Hall, which William Rufus built in his Palace of Westminster between 1097 and 1099. For literature on the latter, see Horn and Born, 1965, 68 note 2. as well as from an important literary source, Alexander Neckham's (1157-1217) Summa de nominibus utensilium4 4 First published by Wright, I, 1857, 103-19, after a thirteenth-century manuscript of the Bibliothèque Nationale and Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève in Paris; cf. Mortet and Deschamps, II, 1929, 181-83, where extracts are reprinted. in which the medieval castle hall is categorically described as follows: And in the hall there should be posts, set up in suitable intervals. And furthermore there should be a full supply of nails, of slats and of various kinds of lath, of tie-beams and of rafters reaching up to the summit of the building. And of shorter beams there should be enough to brace the entire roof frame.5 5 As published by Wright, op. cit., 109-10: "In aula sint postes debitis intersticiis distincti. Clavibus, asseribus, cidulis et latis opus est, et trabibus, et tignis, usque ad doma edificii attingentibus. Tigillis etiam usque ad domus commissuram porrectis." The meaning of these terms is clarified by Norman and Latin interlineary glosses. V.5.2 VERNACULAR MEDIEVAL ROOF TYPES A conspicuous innovation over their prehistoric and early medieval prototypes, both English and Continental, is that the walls are now constructed in masonry—at least in the halls of the leading English feudatories. The ubiquitous smaller manor halls of lesser but still substantial men, continued to be built wholly in timber. Unfortunately the two great halls of Leicester and Hereford are only of limited use in this study. Although they present a clear picture up to the level of the tie beams, the authenticity of their roofs above this level has been questioned and is uncertain.6 6 I no longer feel as sure today of the authenticity of the roof of Leicester Hall as I felt in 1958 (see note 1 above). With the permission of the Leicester County Council and County Architect T. A. Collins, Rainer Berger and I collected in 1962 and 1963 a considerable number of timber samples from the roof trusses of Leicester Hall. These were subsequently measured for radiocarbon content at the Isotope Laboratory of the University of California at Los Angeles. The results of these measurements, not known when this chapter was written, have since been published in Horn, 1970, 59-66 and Berger, 1970, 128-29. Radiocarbon analysis suggests that the majority of the surviving roof trusses of Leicester Hall date from two restorations of the Norman roof, one undertaken in the thirteenth, the other in the fifteenth century. We could not prove that the design of the present roof is identical with that of the Norman hall. The roof-supporting post, on the other hand, was clearly shown to be Norman. However, from the beginning of the thirteenth century onward there is a wealth of aisled buildings with well-preserved roofs. As one reviews this material one finds that the vernacular medieval roof can be classified into two basic designs, to which the German language refers succinctly with the terms Sparrendach (literally: "rafter-roof") and Pfettendach (literally: "purlin-roof"), two words for which the English language has no suitable equivalents.7 7 I am leaving out entirely the field of cruck construction, which although more widespread than formerly believed, is in character too regional to be considered as a third alternative in this context—and also because the cruck truss is essentially a single span, not suited for aisled construction. For the reader who wishes to inform himself on this subject. I recommend the literature quoted in Horn and Charles, 1966; as well as the more comprehensive treatment of this subject in Charles, 1967; and Charles and Horn, 1973. Intrinsically, these are the same two roof types that Vitruvius8 8 See above I, 173-76. describes as the two basic variants in use in Rome in his day; but in contrast to the latter, which 339. LEICESTER CASTLE, LEICESTERSHIRE, ENGLAND. INTERIOR OF THE GREAT HALL, CA. 1150 [Reconstruction by T. H. Fosbrooke] Fosbrooke views the interior of the hall as it would have appeared to one seated at the lord's table, looking down the hall to its lower end, contiguous to the kitchen. The exact construction of the roof is uncertain, but otherwise this is a fairly accurate portrayal of the original appearance of the building. 340. HEREFORD, HEREFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND, BISHOP'S PALACE INTERIOR OF GREAT HALL, CA. 1150 RECONSTRUCTION BY John Clayton, MADE IN 1846 Hereford's interior lost its unitary quality in the 18th and 19th centuries when the bishops, searching for privacy and comfort, marred its original appearance by inserting modern walls and ceilings. Clayton's reconstruction, controversial in some respects, nevertheless well portrays the boldly flowing lines of this majestic interior. The original uprights which support the roof of this hall, encased in a jumble of masonry obscuring them today, are squared oak posts, each with round shafts attached to the four faces and terminating in scalloped capitals. The whole of each upright is hewn from a single timber. From the capitals sprang moulded wooden arches on successive levels, in elegant and impressive spans: first across the aisles, then from pier to pier, and on roof level, across the vast space of the nave. This arched roof construction, as well as the design of the clustered piers and scalloped capitals, intrudes into the framework of the Nordic timber hall features germane to the type of stone construction that occurred in the 12th century only at the highest social levels, but that became more common later on (figs. 346, 348). For recent suggestions concerning the original design of the roof, see R. Radford, E. M. Jope, and J. W. Tonkin, "The Great Hall of the Bishop's Palace at Hereford," Medieval Archaeology, XVII, 1973, 78-86. 341.A CHICHESTER, SUSSEX, ENGLAND, ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL END OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY PLAN SHOWING THE BUILDING IN ITS FULL ORIGINAL LENGTH Except for certain details of carpentry work (cf. fig. 356) and the superior scantling of its timbers, this building reflects a tradition that, at the time of its construction, already spanned 27 centuries. Its plan should be compared with that of the chieftain's house at Feddersen-Wierde (fig. 316.A, B), the cattle barn of Ezinge (figs. 298-299), and the Wohnstallhaus of Aalberg (figs. 310-311) and Elp (fig. 323). St. Mary's shares with them the characteristic that its roof is supported by a timber frame dividing the house into a nave and two aisles, and these internally into a multitude of separate bays, without destroying the unitary quality of the space beneath the roof. 341.B CHICHESTER, SUSSEX, ENGLAND. ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL. END OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY LONGITUDINAL SECTION RESTORED TO ITS ORIGINAL LENGTH The infirmary's elongated shape owes to the same requirements that conditioned its attenuated proto- and prehistorical antecedents, i.e., the arrangement in sequences along both sides of a common hall of a multitude of individual, but not actually separated spaces serving various purposes—a layout ideal for communal living, Wattle walls in earlier buildings (figs. 298-299) are here replaced by masonry, obviously under the influence of church construction—an influence even more forcefully displayed in the design of St. Mary's Gothic chapel. A hospital dedicated to St. Mary was first founded under Henry II by Dean Williams (1158-1172) near the church of St. Mary-in-theMarket. The present structure, separate from buildings of that original foundation, is on a site occupied until 1269 by a settlement of the Grey Friars. In 1290 a public path running across the property was closed; this measure is generally assumed to mark the start of construction of the present hall. Records of gifts and deeds between 1225 and 1250, and a charter established by Dean Thomas of Lichfield (1232-1248) reveal that the hospital was founded as a temporary home for the ill and infirm, and to provide overnight refuge for pilgrims or the wandering poor. Its original inmates were twelve brothers and sisters forming an independent endowed community supervised by a prior or warden. The charter did not provide for a resident priest. Support of a chaplain to be present at all canonical hours and to celebrate the hospital's commemorative masses was founded by a separate land grant to the hospital during the tenure of Dean Thomas. The donation stipulates that the appointment of this chaplain was to remain in the hands of the donors and their heirs; that he was to sit next to the prior and to be in every way second only to him (in mensa et lectu et habitu). In return the donors were to be received and sustained as brothers and sisters of the hospital for the remainder of their lives. The charter nowhere mentions a physician to serve the hospital, which in medieval times, was for care rather than for cure, and primarily a charitable, but not a medical facility as we understand it today (see above, 175ff). Although physicians were associated with certain medieval English hospitals, evidence suggests that such staff positions were rare and, in general, that doctor's services were obtained for individual cases. 341.C CHICHESTER, SUSSEX, ENGLAND. ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL. END OF THIRTEENTH CENTURY TRANSVERSE SECTION The infirmary hall, seemingly more monumental than its prehistoric and early medieval predecessors, owes its appearance primarily to the greater width and height of its bays. The roof-supporting posts rise in the corners of rectangles 27 feet wide and 20 feet deep (measured on center of the posts) which are framed together at a height of 23 feet. The nave width, 27 feet, is just three times that of each aisle (9 feet measured from the inner aisle wall to centers of the posts). For carpentry details of the infirmary hall see fig. 356. In the earlier buildings, nave width only rarely reached twice that of the aisles (figs. 293-299), and in most cases was less (figs. 292, 310, 315, and 323 in particular). But many of these earlier buildings, although narrower and not so high, were considerably longer. The larger of the Bronze Age settlement houses of Elp were 135 feet long. The Migration Period house of Kanne (fig. 290) attained a length of 210 feet in its final state. 342. SCHEME OF CONSTRUCTION DRAWN IN PERSPECTIVE ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL, CHICHESTER, SUSSEX, West, END OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY 343. INTERIOR. A PERSPECTIVE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE ORIGINAL APPEARANCE The interior view of this hall—freed of its post-medieval obstructions—should be compared with our reconstruction of the farmhouse of Ezinge, shown in fig. 297, its senior by sixteen centuries. The carpentry of the Infirmary Hall is more accomplished, its proportions more daring, but the principles of construction, even the spatial appearance, are the same. The aisles, formerly taken up by animals or serving as sleeping alcoves for the farmer and his family here accommodated the beds of the ill. Like the farmhouse of Ezinge, St. Mary's was warmed by an open fireplace in the middle of the center aisle. In 1528 the Infirmary was transformed into an almshouse, under regulations stipulating that each resident, male or female, was to be provided with a private room. This required the installation of individual heating units, which in their ultimate form completely marred the aesthetic concept embodied in the hall. Yet miraculously in the course of these alterations none of the original timbers of the hall were mutilated or altered; thus, in structural terms this reconstruction is authentic. 344. NURSTEAD COURT, KENT, ENGLAND. MANOR HALL, 14TH CENTURY ABOVE: The view is from northeast; to the right lies the kitchen. As in many of its early medieval and prehistoric prototypes (see fig. 325.B), the axis of this hall runs east to west. The door in the eastern end wall leads into a passage between pantry and larder under the hip of the roof at the lower end of the hall. The first door in the northern long wall is in line with the kitchen, and through it the meals are served in the hall. The door at the very end of that wall is reserved for the lord. It gives access to the dais and the private withdrawing rooms above it. AT RIGHT: Interior view looking from the lord's table toward the lower end of the hall. Despite its vast open roof, its magnificently moulded powerful arches, its daringly cambered cross beams, its slender king posts and sharply ascending rafters, this hall cannot conceal its derivation from such humble structures as the farmhouse of Ezinge (figs. 297 and 327) which antedates it by 17 centuries, but with which it nevertheless is connected in direct ancestral lineage.

But not a single truss can be seen today in its entirety because of the insertion of two ceilings, dividing a space once open from floor to ridge, into two stories and an attic. The floor under the hipped portion of the roof is raised one step above the general level of the hall. It is here that the lord and his family took their meals and where distinguished persons sat at feast. Slots in the columns of the dais truss and a center post suggest the existence along this line of a screen that could be opened and closed. But in its vertical elevation even the dais bay was open to the rafters, as must be inferred from the presence of mouldings and other decorative motifs on the wall plates and on the roof plates (now partly covered up by later insertions). 347.B LITTLE CHESTERFORD, ESSEX, ENGLAND.

LITTLE CHESTERFORD, ESSEX, ENGLAND. MANOR HALL CA. 1320-30 PERSPECTIVE RECONSTRUCTION OF INTERIOR LOOKING EASTWARD The manor hall in its ultimate form (fig. 347.B) consisted of a two-storied stone structure, built about 1225, which may have been the original house (Smith, 1956, 83). The aisled timber hall shown above was added to this structure around 1320-30 (Smith, loc. cit.), the original house (now east wing) being rearranged on that occasion to serve as kitchen on the groundfloor, the upper floor probably continuing to be used as withdrawing room. A cross wing with solar (now forming the western end of the hall) was added probably in the early or mid 15th century. Our reconstruction shows the interior of the 14th century hall as it would have appeared to one standing in the westernmost bay looking east through the center bay with its open fireplace into the screen- bay, from which two elegant Gothic entrances lead into the interior of masonry wing. The hall itself is now broken up into a maze of separate rooms on two levels that wholly destroys its spatial aesthetics; but enough of the original timber frame is left to permit a tenable reconstruction: the center truss with its full complement of columns and bracing struts, and the roof over the nave with virtually every individual piece of timber. 349. GREAT COXWELL, BERKSHIRE, ENGLAND BARN OF THE ABBEY GRANGE, FIRST DECADE OF THE 14TH CENTURY VIEW FROM NORTHWEST William Morris, who lived within walking distance of this building while at Kelmscott, believed it to be "the greatest piece of architecture in England." Located in the northern stretches of the vale of the Whitehorse, some two miles southwest of the town of Faringdon in Berkshire, it is without question the finest of the extant medieval barns in England. The great lines of its simple mass, the intersecting bodies of its two large transeptal porches, the steep ascent of its gables, and the noble silhouette of its vast roof are unsurpassed by any structure of like design. Moreover, in the interior, supporting the roof, this barn displays one of the most magnificent frames of timber ever found in a building of this construction type (see fig. 351). were low pitched, the two medieval counterparts rise at very steep angles.9 9 There is another important distinction: in the Vitruvian Sparrendach the rafters converged in a ridge piece. This is not a constituent member of the medieval Sparrendach. We shall illustrate each of these roof types with a few selected buildings. THE SPARRENDACH The Sparrendach is a roof in which a continuous sequence of coupled rafters of relatively light scantling discharge the load and thrust of the roof at close intervals and in equal increments upon the walls or beams on which the rafters were footed. The most widely known house type employing this system is the Lower Saxon farmhouse. A closely related variant of this roof is common in the south and southeast of England. Zippelius has advanced some cogent arguments in favor of the assumption that the roofs of the Iron Age houses of the type of Ezinge, Leens, and Fochteloo belonged to the family of the Sparrendach,10 10 Zippelius, 1953. and this suggests the possibility that both the German and English variant of this roof may have a common root in the Continental homelands of the Saxons and their neighbors, the Frisians. The earliest surviving domestic roof of this construction type is, to the best of my knowledge, that of the aisled Infirmary Hall of St. Mary's in Chichester, Sussex, which dates from the close of the thirteenth century (figs. 341343).11 11 For the date of St. Mary's Hospital in Chichester, see Victoria History of the Counties of England, Sussex, III, 1907, 101ff. For further literature on this building, see Horn and Born, 1965, 47 note 24. Although this hospital was a private foundation, its layout follows a pattern that had been established in the Anglo-Norman monasteries of the two preceding centuries.12 12 A comprehensive review of this material will be found in the Master of Art thesis of Carol Anne Chazin, "The Planning of English Monastic Infirmary Halls in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries: A Typographical Study," University of California, Berkeley, 1965. It consists of an oblong Infirmary Hall, originally of six bays but now reduced to four bays, with its entrance in the middle of the western gable wall. The eastern gable wall opens into a masonry chapel with richly molded Early English arches. The Hall itself is 45 feet wide, 43 feet high (clear inner measurements), and originally had a length of 120 feet. Its roof is sustained by two rows of wooden posts, framed together, at a height of 21 feet, lengthwise by means of arcade plates and crosswise by means of tie beams. The arcade plates are tenoned into a recess in the head of the principal posts, and the tie beams are locked into the arcade plates by means of dovetail joints (fig. 356). The angles between the posts and their superincumbent long and cross beams are strengthened by a magnificent set of three-way double bracing struts of heavy scantling which reduce the free span of the latter to only a fraction of their total length. The rafters rise in two flights, at the same angle, first from the wall plates to the arcade plates, then from the arcade plates to the ridge of the hall; those of the main roof are restrained from moving longitudinally by a center purlin pegged into collar beams and sustained by king posts rising from the center of each alternate tie beam (figs. 341-342). St. Mary's Hospital was founded as a temporary home for the sick and the infirm who were tended by a privately endowed community of thirteen permanent attendants under the guidance of a prior and warden. Its elongated shape is determined by its use as a building for attending to the needs of a considerable number of people, including wandering pilgrims and paupers who sought refuge for a night only.13 13 The original terms of the hospital are known through the records of numerous gifts and deeds made between 1225 and 1250, and through a charter established by Thomas Lichfield (1232-48) setting forth the admission procedures for the establishment. The original text of this charter (Oxford, Bodleian Library, Dept. of Western Manuscripts, MS. University College 148, 10-11) has never been published to my knowledge. A translation into English may be found in Swainson, 1872, 44-47. The contemporary palace and manor halls were shorter. A typical example of the latter with a classical Sparrendach was the manor hall of Nurstead Court, Kent (figs. 344-346). Judging by its architectural style, this hall must have been built during the period when the manor of Nurstede was in possession of the Gravensend family and its construction is generally ascribed to Stephen de Gravensend, who inherited the manor from his father in 1303, became Bishop of London in 1318, and died in 1338.14 14 For Nurstead Court, see Gentlemen's Magazine, 1837, 364-67; Parker, II, 1853, 281ff; Oswald, 1933, 14ff; J.T. Smith, 1956, 84ff. The hall remained essentially unaltered until around 1837 when in response to a need for greater comfort in living one half of it was demolished to make room for a double-storied structure built in the prevailing taste of the period. The other half, likewise, was subdivided into several levels and a variety of rooms, but here the newly inserted walls and ceilings were suspended in the original frame of timber, which is intact although no single part of it can be seen in its entire height. From these remaining parts of the original fabric and several extraordinary sets of drawings made just before the hall was altered, by the superb architectural draftsmen Edward Blore, William Twopeny, and Ambrose Poynter, the original design of the hall can be reconstructed. The hall was 34 feet wide and 79 feet long externally. Its walls were built in flint and rose to a height of 11½ feet With its ridge the roof reached a height of 36 feet. It was hipped on both ends and had small triangular gables at the peak of each hip. The supporting frame of the roof consisted of three powerful trusses, resting on wooden columns with molded bases and capitals and arched braces, rising from the top of the capitals lengthwise to the arcade plates and crosswise to the tie beams. The latter met in the center, forming forcefully pointed arches. The tie beams (like the other principal members, richly molded) are of unusually heavy scantling and have sharp and elegant camber. The roof itself is a classical example of the southern and southeastern English Sparrendach: a continuous sequence 350.A GREAT COXWELL, BERKSHIRE, ENGLAND BARN OF THE ABBEY GRANGE, FIRST DECADE OF THE 14TH CENTURY. PLAN Measured externally and excluding buttresses, the barn of Great Coxwell is 152′ 2″ long by 43′ 10″ wide. It reaches a height of 48 feet at the roof ridge. The walls are built in roughly coursed rubble of Cotswold stone and are reinforced by ashlar-faced buttresses of one stage in the side walls and of three stages in the gable walls. Its vast roof is carried by two rows of slender timber posts so successfully framed together that after some 700 years of resisting pressure and thrust, not one single principal member has been dislodged from its original position. The main components of this frame are six principal and seven intermediary trusses of oak so spaced as to divide the interior lengthwise into a nave and two flanking aisles, and crosswise into a sequence of seven bays. The uprights of the principal trusses (fig. 350.B) rise from tall bases of stone almost 7 feet high, providing a verticality of breathtaking beauty, unmatched by any other extant example of this type of construction. The intermediate trusses are cruck-shaped and rise directly from the aisle walls (fig. 350.C). GREAT COXWELL, BERKSHIRE, ENGLAND 350.C 350.B BARN OF THE ABBEY GRANGE, FIRST DECADE OF THE 14TH CENTURY. TRANSVERSE SECTION A feature of striking beauty at Great Coxwell is the design of the three-way double braces (fig. 351) which rise from the main posts to their connecting long and cross beams. Reducing the unsupported length of the beams that they brace to less than one third their total length, the braces prevent them from sagging under the weight of the super-incumbent rafters. At the same time, they protect the frame from rocking and swerving by stiffening the angles. The manner in which these braces reach out into space and assist the principal members of the supporting roof frame to divide the interior into a sequence of separate bays may be compared to the rise and spread of the bay-dividing shafts and arches of a medieval masonry church. It has been argued with great plausibility that this method of framing space by an all-pervasive armature of structural members is older in wood construction than in stone (see I, 223ff). 351. GREAT COXWELL, BERKSHIRE, ENGLAND BARN OF ABBEY GRANGE, FIRST DECADE OF 14TH CENTURY. INTERIOR LOOKING SOUTHWARD [by courtesy of the National Buildings Record, London] An even greater tribute than that accorded to this building by William Morris (fig. 349) was made by Thomas Hardy when in a passage of great historical sensitivity, he wrote about a similar building in Dorsetshire: "They sheared in the great barn, called for the nonce the Shearing-barn, which on ground-plan resembled a church with transepts. It not only emulated the form of the neighbouring church of the parish, but vied with it in antiquity. . . . One could say about this barn, what could hardly be said of either the church or the castle, akin to it in age and style, that the purpose which had dictated its original erection was the same to which it was still applied. Unlike and superior to either of those two typical remnants of mediaevalism, the old barn embodied practises which had suffered no mutilation at the hands of time" (Far from the Madding Crowd, chapter XXII). 352. PARÇAY-MESLAY, NEAR TOURS (INDRE-ET-LOIRE), FRANCE BARN OF ABBEY GRANGE, 1211-1227. EXTERIOR VIEW FROM THE NORTHEAST The grange consisted of a large rectangular yard, enclosed by a tall masonry wall. Incorporated into this wall in the south was a gate house with a monumental round-arched passageway, and on a second level above it, a fenestrated chamber with fireplace—the dwelling doubtless of the supervising granger. Its vast five-aisled barn, with masonry gables rising from floor to ridge, is the only surviving structure of an intricate group of buildings once forming the inhabited nucleus of this agricultural enterprise. For á plan showing the full complement of buildings of such a grange, made at a time when it was substantially in its original form, see Horn and Born, 1968, Pl. XIX, fig. 10. 353. PARÇAY-MESLAY, NEAR TOURS (INDRE-ET-LOIRE), FRANCE BARN OF ABBEY GRANGE, 1211-1227. INTERIOR LOOKING EAST The low pitch of the roof of this barn—distinctly different from the steep ascent of the roof of the barn at Great Coxwell (figs. 349-51) is conditioned in part by its extraordinary width (twice that of Great Coxwell), but the decision to develop space in breadth rather than height may have been conditioned also by climatic and cultural factors: the barn lies at the southern boundary of the area of distribution of steep roofs. of paired rafters with collar beams pegged to a center purlin by crown posts that rise from the middle of each tie beam. The westernmost bay of the hall was of two stories, screened off against the two center bays on the ground floor by timber screens; higher up, by a wall of plaster reaching all the way up to the ridge of the roof. This end served as the private quarters for the lord of the manor. The opposite end of the hall was screened off in a similar manner by a low timber screen with three doorways; the middle one opened into a passage that led outside; the two outer ones, into two rooms which could either have served as quarters for the servants or as buttery and pantry. The kitchen was in a separate building to the north of the hall and could be reached from the latter through a door in the northern long wall. The hall of the manor of Nurstead is one of the last examples of the traditional open hall where the lord and the servants still lived and ate under the same roof in opposite ends of the building—an arrangement that is very similar to, although not identical in all details with that of the House for Distinguished Guests of the Plan of St. Gall (fig. 396). The two center bays of the hall were communal space, which on festive occasions was the stage for banquets with the open fire burning in the middle of the center floor, as can be inferred from the smoke blackened beams and rafters. At the very same time England had already developed a new plan, which provided for two double-storied cross wings at the end of the hall, one of which served as the private dwelling of the lord and his family; the other, as quarters for the servants (including space for kitchen, buttery, and pantry.) A typical example of this new arrangement is the manor hall of Little Chesterford, Essex, a plan and perspective reconstruction of which are shown in figures 347-348. The hall has been ascribed by its earlier students to about 127515 15 Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments, Essex, I, 1916, 173-75. and by J. T. Smith to about 1320-30.16 16 J. T. Smith, 1956, 83. One of its aisles has been dismantled. Originally the hall was 27 feet wide and 37 feet long. It was of three bays with the one near the entrance serving as a narrow screen-bay. The walls were timber framed, but all other details were very similar to those of the hall of Nurstead Court—less forceful and elegant, yet still of genuine refinement. In the fourteenth century the English lowlands must have been dotted with countless variants of this type of hall.17 17 For a brief description of others, see Smith, ibid., 76ff. THE PFETTENDACH The Sparrendach works with only one kind of rafter; the Pfettendach differs from it in employing two kinds—one of light, the other of heavy, scantling. The heavy, or principal, rafters rise from the ends of the tie beams to the ridge of the roof, forming powerful trusses that carry purlins and, as a rule, a ridge piece; and it is upon these longitudinal timbers (purlins and ridge piece) that the lighter common rafters of the roof are mounted. In the Pfettendach the major burden of the roof is transmitted by the purlins to the principal trusses which discharge it upon the walls at the beginning and at the end of each bay, to points which, if the walls are built in masonry, are usually reinforced by buttresses. The best known variant of the Pfettendach is the roof of the Early Christian basilica18 18 Cf. above, pp. 173-76ff. and all its Mediterranean medieval derivatives. But the Pfettendach is also, as we have seen, the standard roof in the North Germanic territories of Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland.19 19 Cf. above, pp. 45ff. and M. Wood, "13th-century Domestic Architecture in England;" 1950, 1-150. The two earliest surviving examples of a vernacular medieval Pfettendach are the roofs of the barn of the abbey grange of Great Coxwell in Berkshire, a dependency of the Cistercian Abbey of Beaulieu in Hampshire (figs. 349-354) and the barn of the abbey grange of Parçay-Meslay, near Tours, in France, a dependency of the monastery of Marmoutier (figs. 352-355). The former dates from the first decade of the fourteenth century;20 20 For this date see Siebenlist-Kerner, Schove, and Fletcher, "The Barn at Great Coxwell," in Dendrochronology in Europe (forthcoming) that supplants radiocarbon dating by Horn and Born, 1965; Horn and Berger, 1970. the latter belongs to a group of buildings that tradition ascribes to Abbot Hugue de Rochecorbon (1211-27).21 21 The general character of the masonry work of the barn is in full accord with this date. There is some question, however, of whether the present timbers of the barn of Parçay-Meslay are the original ones. Aymar Verdier, who discussed this building in his Architecture civile et domestique (Verdier, 1864, 37-35), reports that M. Drouet, who acquired the barn after the French Revolution and saved it from demolition, was of the opinion that the original frame of timber had caught fire during the invasion of the Touraine by the English in 1437. I have no means of judging whether this view is based on any valid historical evidence. But even if the present timbers were proved to date from the fifteenth century, this would have little bearing on our argument since a sufficient number of other thirteenth-century barns survive to indicate that the type of carpentry employed in Parçay-Meslay was widely used in the thirteenth century; cf. Horn, 1958, 12-14. The barn of Great Coxwell (figs. 349-351) is 152 feet long and 44 feet wide (external measurements not counting buttresses) and reaches a height of 48 feet at the ridge. Its vast roof rests on purlins which are held in place by seven principal trusses sustained by posts, and six intermediate trusses in cruck construction rising directly from the aisle walls. The uprights of the principal trusses rest on tall bases of stone almost seven feet high, and are framed together 30 feet above the floor of the barn, first crosswise by means of tie beams, then lengthwise by means of arcade plates—a reversal of the normal and more common procedure of housing the plates beneath the tie beams in a recess cut into the head of the supporting posts (fig. 357). The tall, narrow proportions of these trusses are exciting. 354.A PARÇAY-MESLAY, NEAR TOURS (INDRE-ET-LOIRE), FRANCE BARN OF ABBEY GRANGE, 1211-1227. PLAN The twelve roof-supporting trusses of the barn are not in alignment with the buttresses of the two long walls. This could be interpreted to mean that the present frame of timber is not the original one, if this conclusion were not invalidated by the even more startling observation that the buttresses of the two long walls fail to align with one another. An oral tradition, the precise sources of which we have not been able to identify, claims that the original roof of the barn was destroyed by a fire in 1437 during the war with the English. Radiocarbon measurements taken of samples extracted from two different posts did not confirm this tradition (see Horn, 1970, 28; and Berger, 1970, 111-112). It is possible that the craftsman who built the masonry shell of the structure did not know what the carpenter had in mind; and even the carpenter, in many cases might not have known of what number of trusses his roof-supporting frame of timber would be composed until he was apprised of the length and strength of the available timbers. In its ultimate form the roof was composed of twelve trusses dividing the space internally into thirteen bays each of a depth of 13 feet. The location of the buttresses would have suggested a barn of seven bays, each of a depth of 24 feet, which is possible but structurally more risky. 354.B PARÇAY-MESLAY, NEAR TOURS (INDRE-ET-LOIRE), FRANCE BARN OF ABBEY GRANGE, 1211-1227. TRANSVERSE SECTION This is, to the best of our knowledge, the only surviving five-aisled medieval barn of transalpine Europe. There were others. The plan of the abbey of Clairvaux and its grange of Ultra Alba (a short distance away on the opposite bank of the river Aube) records, besides two five-aisled structures of this type, two barns that even had seven aisles. The largest among these was 210 feet long and 120 feet wide; 40 feet longer and wider than Parçay-Meslay (for a plan and bird's-eye view see Horn and Born, 1968, Pl. XIX, figs. 10 and 11). Since most Cistercian monasteries possessed between ten and fifteen outlying granges, the number of buildings of this kind must have been legion. Clairvaux and Morimond counted twelve; the Abbey of Foigny fourteen; the Abbey of Fontmorigny seven; and the Abbey of Chaalis, fifteen. On many granges, as in Ultra Alba, there were not one but two or even more such structures. Since at the beginning of the 13th century there existed in France some 500 Cistercian monasteries, the total number of barns of this order only, and in France only, must have ranged between 5,000 and 10,000. 355. PARÇAY-MESLAY, NEAR TOURS (INDRE-ET-LOIRE), FRANCE BARN OF ABBEY GRANGE, 1211-1227. INTERIOR LOOKING UP INTO THE ROOF RIDGE The roof of the barn is made stable by means of a sub ridge running parallel to and below the main ridge beam. The two are stiffened by St. Andrew's crosses (two bracing struts half-lapped at midpoint at right angles and tenoned into the paired ridge beams). This remarkable engineering came to be adopted in and widely diffused by 19th-century steel construction some 600 years after this huge timber frame was made. The building is made structurally stable by means of its extraordinary system of internal bracing, and is without need of an external source of support such as might have otherwise been provided by massive masonry walls. In consequence of its self-contained equilibrium, supplied by the genius of a master carpenter, the building provides the evidence that demonstrates the handsome masonry walls were constructed after completion of the wooden frame. A feature of striking beauty is the three-way double braces which rise from the main posts to their connecting long and cross beams. By reducing the unsupported length of the beams that they brace to less than one third of their total length, they prevent them from sagging under the weight of the superincumbent rafters, while at the same time protecting the frame from rocking and swerving. The walls are built in roughly coursed rubble with buttresses of high quality ashlar masonry. The two large doors in the gable walls are modern. In the Middle Ages the barn was entered broadside through two transeptal porches, one of which had on its upper level the office of the supervising monastic granger. The barn of Parçay-Meslay (figs. 352-355) is quite as impressive. It lacks the breathtaking steepness of Great Coxwell, but its space is of a vastness that can only be compared to that of an Early Christian basilica or of a modern airplane hangar. It has a clear inner length of 170 feet, and a clear inner width of 80 feet. From floor to ridge it measures 44 feet. Its vast tile-covered roof is supported by twelve aisled trusses which divide the space lengthwise into a nave and four aisles. The barn of ParçayMeslay is the only example of this type to have survived the French Revolution; but the existence of other barns of similar design and even larger dimensions, dating from the twelfth century, is attested by Dom Milley's engravings of the Abbey of Clairvaux, published in 1708.22 22 Reproduced in Horn, 1958, 13, figs. 26 and 27. It is a purlin roof like Great Coxwell, and similar in many other respects, but the trusses of Parçay-Meslay are more closely spaced and are all of the same design. The assemblage of arcade plate and post follows the more common pattern of housing the plates in the head of the posts and locking the tie beams into both of these members simultaneously from above by means of dovetail joints and mortice-and-tenon joints. The bracing struts are short and sturdy, and the posts throughout have joweled heads. As in Great Coxwell the purlins ride on the back of principal rafters that run parallel to the common rafters, a short distance farther inward (figs. 353-354). As in Great Coxwell these inner rafters are braced by diagonal struts that rise from the top of the tie beam. In Great Coxwell the principal rafters over the nave terminated in the ends of a collar beam that stiffened the corresponding pair of outer rafters some distance below the ridge of the roof (fig. 350). In Parçay-Meslay they are buttressed against a king post that reaches all the way up to the ridge of the roof (fig. 354). There are other differences. Unlike Great Coxwell, Parçay-Meslay has no gable trusses. Instead, all longitudinal members (plates and purlins) terminate in sockets built into the masonry walls. A more important difference, however, is that while in Great Coxwell a major portion of the roof load is transmitted to the masonry of the long walls, in Parçay-Meslay it is almost entirely absorbed in the timber frame. The walls, of course, contribute their share in steadying the work, but there is a complete set of outer posts addorsed to the walls on either side of the barn, making the timber frame virtually autonomous. In Great Coxwell the buttresses of the masonry walls are in careful alignment with the timber frame. In Parçay-Meslay carpenter and mason went separate ways. No single buttress is in line with any of the timber trusses. One of the most remarkable features of the carpentry of Parçay-Meslay is the measure taken, both in the lower and upper stage of the trusses, to restrain the frame from moving longitudinally. In the lower stage this is accomplished by straining beams running parallel to the arcade plates, some 12 feet beneath them. They are tenoned into the posts just below the springing of the main braces and are braced in turn by short angle struts (fig. 353). In the upper stage of the trusses the same task is performed by the introduction of a sub-ridge running parallel to the main ridge, some 9 feet beneath it, and stiffened in its relation to the main ridge by means of St. Andrew crosses (fig. 355)—a notable piece of engineering. The roof of Parçay-Meslay is a typical Continental purlin roof, of a kind that is well attested through many other Continental barns of the thirteenth century.23 23 For a good sampling of these buildings (with which Ernest Born and I shall deal extensively in a separate study) see Horn, 1958, 13ff. Other French thirteenth-century barns with purlin roofs are: Ardennes (Calvados), Beauvais St.-Lazare (Oise), Canteloup (Eure), Cire-les-Mello (Oise), Fay-les Etangs (Oise), Maubuisson (Seine-et-Oise), Perrières (Calvados), Troussure (Oise), Vaumoise (Oise), Vaulerand (Seine-et-Oise). This type was still in use in the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth centuries as the standard form for the roof of market halls.24 24 See Horn, loc. cit. Also to be considered in this context are the market halls of Crémieu (Isère) and Questembert (Morbihan), dealt with in Horn and Born, 1961, 66-90, and Horn, 1963. The grange lies 9 km. northeast of Tours and ca. 1 km. north of the village of ParçayMeslay. Marmoutier, its mother house, lay on the outshirts of Tours and slightly upstream, on the Loire's north bank; nationalized in 1818, the abbey was then razed. The grange at Parçay-Meslay stands as a solitary reminder of the former grandeur of this abbey, once among the most powerful houses of Christendom. GREAT COXWELL, BERKSHIRE, ENGLAND 357.B 357.A BARN, ABBEY GRANGE, FIRST DECADE 14TH CENTURY DETAIL: ASSEMBLED, DISASSEMBLED, principal post, tie beam, roof plate CHICHESTER, SUSSEX, ENGLAND 356.B 356.A ST. MARY'S HOSPITAL, END OF THE 13TH CENTURY DETAIL: ASSEMBLED, DISASSEMBLED, principal post, tie beam, roof plate At St. Mary's, the roof or arcade plates are set into a shoulder of the principal posts. A projecting tenon of the latter is mortised into the tie beam which in this manner comes to rest above the roofplate. All converging members of the frame are so carefully interlocked by protruding and receding elements so as to prevent any slipping, shift, or dislocation. In the joinery of the Barn of Great Coxwell the tie beams are likewise mortised into a tenon of the principal posts, but the roof plates are notched over the tie beam—an assembly which, because of its relative rarity in England is there referred to as "reversed assembly". The latter is rather common on the Continent. Both methods are fine examples of medieval carpentry. V. 6 CRITERIA OF RECONSTRUCTION II V.6.1 ROOF CONSTRUCTION: ASSEMBLAGE OF THE SUPPORTING FRAME OF TIMBER The aisled and timbered medieval barns and houses discussed in the preceding pages give us a fairly good idea of the kind of carpentry we might expect to have been employed in the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall. Although we could identify two distinct classes of roofs, we found that the roof-supporting trusses were of very similar design in both cases. In the majority of buildings the arcade plates from which the rafters spring were tenoned into a recess in the head of the posts. The tie beams were laid upon this assemblage from above and were locked into the posts by means of mortice-and-tenon joints, into the arcade plates by dovetail joints (fig. 356). One building only, the Barn of Great Coxwell, Berkshire, departed from this rule by putting the plates on top of the tie beams (fig. 357). We have chosen the more common form of Chichester (fig. 356) and Parçay-Meslay (fig. 354B) as the standard form for our reconstruction of the post-and-plate assemblage of the houses of the Plan of St. Gall. The bracing beams were either straight, bent, or curved; sometimes long, sometimes short; sometimes single, sometimes double; but in all cases of relatively heavy scantling. We may safely assume that all of the simpler variants of this group were in use in Carolingian times, excluding such types, of course, that owed their design to influences from Romanesque and Gothic masonry architecture, such as the round arches of Hereford Palace (fig. 340) or the Gothic arches of Nurstead Court, Kent (fig. 345) and Little Chesterford, Essex (fig. 348). From the side of the aisles, the principal trusses were steadied by aisle ties, tenoned into the freestanding posts on the level of the wall head. The outer ends of these ties served as springing for inner rafters of heavy scantling, running parallel to the roof slope, a short distance inward, and butted into the heads of the principal posts some two or three feet below the arcade plate. On the wall side these aisle ties rested either on two parallel courses of wall plates, one running along the outer, the other along the inner edge of the wall head, as in Great Coxwell (fig. 350B); or they were tenoned into the heads of posts set against the long walls on the inside, a method by means of which the timber frame was, structurally, held virtually independent of the masonry walls, as in Parçay-Meslay (fig. 354B). In buildings constructed entirely in wood the post-to-plate assemblage of the outer walls would, of course, have been a repetition on a smaller scale of that of the principal posts and the arcade plates (as in the barn of Little Wymondly, discussed below, fig. 434). In reconstructing the St. Gall outbuildings, we have chosen freely, from among all these different possibilities, whatever the condition of a particular building suggested as the most logical solution. V.6.2 ROOF CONSTRUCTION: SOME ALTERNATIVE ASSUMPTIONS So far we are on fairly safe ground. The range of possibilities widens drastically, however, as we move from the main stage of the trusses to the assemblage of the roof itself. Here, in light of the available historical evidence, we are forced to make a choice between two radically different systems: the roofs of the guest and service buildings must either have belonged to the family of the Sparrendach or to the family of the Pfettendach. As we have no way of knowing to which of these two they belonged—rather than decide this issue in an arbitrary manner—we have chosen to use both systems. Our reconstruction of the House for Distinguished Guests (figs. 397-399)1 1 See below, pp. 155-65. is a typical example of the purlin roof; that of the Granary (figs. 435A-F),2 2 See below, pp. 215-22. of the rafter roof. It is not at all impossible that both types were used together—and there is also, of course, the possibility of early hybridization. We have fashioned our reconstruction after English and French models rather than Dutch and German, because the English and French material is older than the earliest Dutch and German parallels, which do not antedate the beginning of the sixteenth, or at best the end of the fifteenth, century. There is one further alternative to be taken into consideration. Among the excavated pre- and protohistoric houses previously discussed are found a small number of buildings that had their ridges supported by a median row of posts (see Wijchen, figs. 301-302).3 3 See above, pp. 55-56. They are few, true enough, but their existence forces us to take them into account, the more so since in the territory of the Bajuvarians, at least, this house was common enough to merit legal codification (see above, pp. 27ff and figs. 289A-B). I do not believe, however, that the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall should be reconstructed in this manner, since the houses of the Plan of St. Gall have vital passageways at the very spot where the construction of the Bajuvarian standard house calls for ridge-supporting center posts. I draw special attention to the doorways in the House for Distinguished Guests connecting the dining hall with the bedrooms of the royalty housed in this structure.4 4 See above, p. 146, fig. 396. As one inspects the remaining houses one by one, one finds that the entrances from the hearth-room to the two end rooms invariably lie in the longitudinal axis of the building. This arrangement is incompatible with the ridgepole construction of the Bajuvarian standard house. Our choice for the roof skin of the guest and service buildings is shingle. Thatch and reed, while common in the sixth, seventh, and eighth centuries, would have been an anachronism in the ninth in a monastery of paradigmatic significance. I remind the reader of the passage already quoted in the Life of St. Benedict of Aniane where we are told that he covered the houses of his monastery at Aniane first with thatch (non tegulis rubentibus, sed stramine) and then completely redid them in tile (non iam stramine domos, sed tegulis cooperit).5 5 See I, 176ff. In the southern, more Romanized parts of the Carolingian empire, tile was doubtlessly the customary material. Farther north it is more likely to have been shingle, probably the larger variety which in vernacular American English is referred to as "shakes." Numerous medieval sources could be quoted in support of widespread use of shingles.6 6 For shingles in Carolingian architecture, see Schlosser, 1896, index under scindula and tegula; for the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Morter, 1911, index under bardeaux and Mortet-Deschamps, 1929, index under bardeaux; cf. also Guérard, 1844, 734, and Du Cange, VII, 1938, 354-55, under scindula. I confine myself to one, the well-known passage in Ekkehart's Casus sancti Galli, where we are told how the fire set by a pupil to the roof of the Outer School of the monastery of St. Gall ignited "the dry shingles" (tegula arida) of the school and from there was blown by the north wind to the roof of an adjacent church tower, which had "a shingled roof superimposed upon a stone roof" (tegulis ligneis super lapideas tecta).7 7 Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, chap. 67. ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 240-41; ed. Helbling, 1958, 127-28. V.6.3 CARPENTRY JOINTS I am intentionally not entering into a discussion of carpentry joints, but refer the reader to the masterful review of pre-medieval methods of jointing timbers, published by Adelhart Zippelius in 1954,8 8 Zippelius, 1954. which discloses that all later known methods of assembling timbers, such as halving (Verkämmung), joining by mortice and tenon (Verzapfung), and lapjoining (Verblattung) were in full use in the Iron Age, some being attested for the Bronze Age and even for the Younger Stone Age (fig. 300), including the very sophisticated dovetail joint. In our reconstruction we have not used any carpentry joints that are not well attested for the Middle Ages. We cannot prove that all of these were in use at the time of Louis the Pious. Some of them possibly were not. But to anyone who is inclined to underrate the skill of Carolingian carpenters we recommend a study of the intricate carpentry joints discovered in the two fortified ninth-century sites of Stellerburg9 9 Rudolph, 1942, passim. and of Husterknupp.10 10 Zippelius in Herrnbrodt, 1958, 123-200. For later periods see Deneux, 1927, passim. V.6.4 PROCEDURES FOLLOWED IN RECONSTRUCTION In what follows, then, we are entering upon the task of reconstructing the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall, structure by structure. All buildings are drawn to scale. But certain liberties of interpretation are inevitable when the constructional elements of a house whose vertical elements are rendered in simple line projection have to be converted into three-dimensional entities. All vertical values will by necessity remain a matter of speculation. In calculating our elevations we have followed the same method that we used in our reconstruction of the Church, assigning to each component space in the house the comfortable minimum proportions required by its function. We have assumed that the roof slopes follow, in general, an angle of 45 degrees. This is a reasonable, yet by no means compelling, assumption. The working out of the constructional details of some forty-odd buildings is not only an arduous, but also a very costly task—so costly and complex, indeed, that we might never have accomplished it had the Council of Europe exhibition Charlemagne (held in Aachen in the summer of 1965) not afforded us the unique opportunity of testing our views in the construction of a three-dimensional model of the monastic buildings shown on the Plan of St. Gall. Although in the majority of cases this model called for exterior views only, it was obvious enough that even this objective could not be attained unless the internal constructional problems of each house were settled. This required for each individual building a complete set of work-drawings, sufficiently detailed and comprehensive so as to allow, if need be, for reconstruction of the houses in their actual size.11 11 We are greatly indebted to the director and organizer of the Charlemagne exhibition, Dr. Wolfgang Braunfels, for having originated this challenging project; to the Council of Europe for financing the construction of the model; and to the Chancellor of the University of California at Berkeley, for the funds required in making these drawings. We were fortunate to find in the builder of that model, the late Mr. Siegfried Karschunke, a craftsman of superior skill and taste. It is on these drawings that the reconstructions in the present study are based. We cannot dare to claim that our interpretations are the last word on this challenging subject, but we believe them to be based on sound historical assumption. We are certain that they are sound in all of their constructional implications. Before turning to the discussion of the individual structures, however, an important detail remains to be settled, i.e., the question of the heating, lighting, and ventilation devices of the guest and service buildings. PLAN OF ST. GALL. HEARTHS 358.A HOUSE FOR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS This is the only instance on the Plan where the square in the center of the common living and dining room is designated as LOCUS FOCI, an open "fire place" that serves as the primary source of heat for the house. 358.B HOSPICE FOR PILGRIMS AND PAUPERS The word TESTU refers to a lantern that protects an opening in the roof admitting light and air to the house and also serving as smoke escape for the open fire place located directly beneath it. 358.C THE OUTER SCHOOL In the Outer School the center room is divided by a median wall partition into two class rooms each furnished with its own fire place. PLANS 1:192 V. 7 DEVICES FOR HEATING, LIGHTING, VENTILATION, AND COOKING V.7.1 THE CENTRAL HEARTH AND THE LOUVER THE MEANING OF LOCUS FOCI AND TESTU One of the striking typological characteristics of the guest and service buildings on the Plan is the squares in the center of these houses referred to varyingly as locus foci and testu (fig. 358A-C). The first of these terms clearly refers to the "fireplace" or open hearth in the middle of the floor which heats the house. The second, testu, requires some explanation. It has generally been taken to be an abbreviation for the word testudo ("turtle" or "roof"),1 1 Cf. above, p. 3ff. but I do not think that this is the correct interpretation. Testu, as an abbreviation for testudo, with no sign given to indicate that a part of the word is missing, is not consistent with the author's other abbreviations,2 2 The scribe is very careful with his abbreviations and in general designates contractions or omissions by the customary symbols. I would draw attention especially to the word longitudo in one of the explanatory titles of the Church (cf. Vol. I, p. 77); it is contracted into LONG?T?·, but the fact that the letters UDO are missing is indicated by a horizontal bar over the IT and a point beside the T·. In two other titles of the same Church the word latitudo is spelled out. The word pedum in the same titles is either spelled out or contracted into ped? (a horizontal bar indicating the missing m). The Plan, it is true, contains a few capricious abbreviations (cf. III, 12) and in some cases (I am aware of six, (cf. III, 11) the horizontal bar, standing for m, is omitted over a terminal vowel; but it appears to me unlikely that an entire syllable would be dropped, either intentionally or inadvertently, from a technical term that appears on three crucial places of the Plan, that was not used in this sense in classical times, and must have been relatively rare even in Medieval Latin. and there is no reason to assume that he departed from his normal procedure because of the smallness of the space in which the word had to be inscribed. The testu square in the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers (fig. 358B) is large enough to accommodate the whole word testudo and several other words if necessary. What the scribe had in mind, in my opinion, was the word testu, exactly as it is written—a rare yet perfectly meaningful term. Testu (indeclinable) means the "lid of a pot."3 3 For testa, testu, and testudo, see Walde and Hofmann, II, 1938, 675, 677; Forcellini, IV, 1940, 710, 714; Lewis and Short, 1945, 1862, 1864. It is closely related to testa, which means "shell," either the shell that covers a testaceous animal, the human skull (testa hominis), or human artifacts of comparable construction, 359. WIJCHEN, GELDERLAND, THE NETHERLANDS This Iron Age house of modest design was unearthed on a chain of hills skirting a moor that once may have formed an outer arm of the Maas. The house was internally divided into two areas one of which contained its hearth. Four independent posts surrounding the hearth are most reasonably explained as the supports of a small roof protecting an opening in the main roof admitting light and air and also allowing the smoke to escape. NEAR THE RIVER MAAS (10KM WEST OF NIJMEGEN) PLAN. IRON AGE HOUSE [after F. Bloemen, 1933, 5, fig. 5] such as clay bowls or pots. Testudo is a derivative of both these words. It shares with them the basic meaning of "protective cover." In everyday language testudo meant a "tortoise" or "turtle"; in military language it was the name for the protective covering formed when soldiers held their shields overhead and locked them together. By analogy, in architectural terminology—both classical and medieval— testudo came to be the word used for "roof," usually a roof of timber, but also by extension, a "vaulted roof."4 4 For the occurrence of the term in medieval literature, see the indices in Lehmann-Brockhaus, II, 1938, 332; and Schlosser, 1896, 481. The word-index in Lehmann-Brockhaus, 1955ff, was not yet published at the time of this writing. Even supposing that the author of the Plan had in mind testudo, rather than testu, it is unlikely that he referred to the principal roof of the building; rather, he must have meant a roof equal in size with the square in which the term was written; and since this square is designated both as testu and as locus foci, it is most probably to be understood as "a protective shield above the hearth," the purpose of which must have been to form a cover for a central smoke outlet. Such openings in the roof above the hearth are, in fact, a feature of the protohistoric and early medieval building tradition just discussed, and they remained an intrinsic part of vernacular buildings throughout the Middle Ages. 360. KRAGHEDE, VENDSYSSEL, DENMARK This Danish Iron Age House is of very similar design to the Dutch specimen shown in the preceding figure. It shows four independent inner posts related to the hearth in an identical manner. In houses of relatively small dimensions it made sense to support the hearth-protecting lantern by poles rising from the ground. In larger houses, as the subsequent figures show, this was accomplished by timbers forming part of the roof frame. PLAN. IRON AGE HOUSE [after Hatt, 1928, 254, fig. 25] THE LIGHT AND SMOKE HOLES OF THE NORDIC SAGA HOUSE This roof device is well attested in the Nordic Sagas where, according to its function, it is referred to varyingly as "smoke hole" (reykháfr, reykberi), "light inlet" (ljóri), or "air inlet" (vindgluggr, vindauga).5 5 Cf. above, pp. 23-24, and for reference to original sources Gudmundsson, 1889, 163ff. Little is known about the size and shape of these devices, but apparently they were large enough to be used as an escape hatch when all other passages were blocked. The Sagas abound with tales of exits made in this manner. A passage from the Vatnsdœla Saga gives a typical example: "And so was this [house] arranged that from that pile of goods, one could step up into a big smoke hole [í einn storan reykbera] which was over the hall [er á var skálanum] and when the marauder investigated the pile, þorsteinn was outside" [var þorsteinn úti, the sense being: þorsteinn had gained his freedom by escaping through the smoke hole].6 6 Vatnsdæla Saga, ed. Vogt, 1921, 6: Vatnsdaler's Saga. English translation by Jones, 1944, 22. The openings of these light and smoke holes could be closed by means of wooden shutters (spjaeld) or boards (fjöl) which were placed in position with the help of a pole 361. NEW COLLEGE, OXFORD, ENGLAND THE GREAT HALL, 1378-1386 [after Loggan, 1675] The lantern-surmounted ridges of these buildings built approximately one hundred years apart attest the effectiveness of the device on larger structures of monumental character. or rope; or they were screened with transparent membranes made from the stomach lining of a hog mounted on movable frames (skjágluggr, skjávindauga). We read of the first type in Haralds saga har?ra?a: "The king then let a board (fjöl) be moved in front of the light hole (ljórann) so that only a small opening was left . . . Einar entered and said, `Dark is it in the King's Council Hall (málstofa).' At the same moment men rushed on him. . . ."7 7 Haralds Saga Hardrada, chap. 63, ed. Gudmundsson, VI, 1831, 281. Cf. also Heímskringla, ed. Unger, 1868, 579; and in English translation by Monsen, 1932, 531. The second type is mentioned in an equally dramatic passage of the GullÞoris saga, where Þorir, finding himself trapped in the hall by Þorbjörn's housecarls, with all exits blocked, "grabbed a pole and raised it under the `skin hole' (skjárinn) and there went out and pulled up the pole, and then ran up to the mountains."8 8 Gull-Þoris Saga, ed. Maurer, 1858, 62. PROTOHISTORIC EVIDENCE FOR LIGHT AND SMOKE HOLES Evidence for the existence of poles rising from the ground to form a canopy around and over the hearth has been found in aisled Iron Age houses at Hodorf, Germany (fig. 307), and Wijchen, Holland (fig. 359), as well as in the 362.

NAPA VALLEY, CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA DAIRY BARN WITH LOUVERS The most common and widely diffused survival form of the testu of the Plan are the lantern-surmounted openings in the roofs of barns found at every community of the great farm belt of Canada and the United States. The relatively rare occurrence of these hearth poles suggests, however, that in general the protective shields were mounted directly on the roof rather than on special supports. The latter system would have been entirely inappropriate in larger halls, since it would have required an underpinning of timbers entirely out of scale with the superstructure that it served to support. MEDIEVAL EXAMPLES A fairly accurate picture of these smoke and air hole coverings may be obtained from some of the old engravings of early English college halls, for instance, those of Oxford's New College (fig. 361) and Magdalen College (fig. 362), as shown in David Loggan's illustratious Oxonia Illustrata of 1675.10 10 David Loggan, Oxonia Illustrata, 1675 (unpaginated). New College Hall, the oldest of the surviving college halls of Oxford, was built between 1378-1386 by William of Wykeham. Magdalen College was founded in 1448 by William of Waynflete, but its buildings were not completed until 1480. Both these halls were built during a period when new discoveries in the technique of roof construction made it possible to dispense with the two rows of roof-supporting posts which formerly divided the hall into a nave and two 364. NEAR BENICIA, CALIFORNIA LOUVER ON COLLAPSING BARN accompanying aisles. Thus it became possible not only to cover the space in a single span but also to lift the roof upon walls of considerable height. Yet even in this new and more fashionable hall, which permitted large windows, the traditional opening in the roof above the hearth was retained as the principal exit for smoke. The roof of the hall of Magdalen College shows what extraordinary dimensions these openings could obtain. The medieval term for these smoke holes is fumerium ("smoke hole") or lovarium (identical with Old French louvert, "opening"). The so-called Liberate Rolls of King Henry III, issued in 1216 and 1272 (verbal directive for repair and construction of houses owned by the crown) make frequent reference to these devices.11 11 Extracts of the "Liberate Rolls" of King Henry III are published in Turner, 1877, 181ff. For passages that bear directly on the subject, compare in particular, Roll 32, ibid., 216-17: "The keeper of the manor of Woodstock is ordered . . . to make a hearth [astrum] of free-stone, high and good, in the chamber above the wine-cellar in the great court, and a great louver over the said hearth; and to make a door under the door of Edward the king's son, and two great louvers [lovaria] in the queen's chamber. . . ." Roll 28, ibid., 201, to the keepers of the works at Woodstock: "And make also in our great hall at Woodstock a certain great louver [fumerium]"; Roll 30, ibid., 209-10: "The sheriff of Southhampton is ordered . . . to paint and gild the heads on the dais in the king's great hall there, and to cover the louvers [fumericios] on it with lead"; Roll 35, ibid., 234: "The sheriff of Wiltshire is ordered to re-roof the queen's chapel, and to repair the louver [fumatorium] above the king's hall at Clarendon which is injured by the wind"; Roll 36, ibid., 234-35: "The king to the sheriff of Nottingham. We command you to block up the cowled windows [fenestras culiciatas] on the south side of the great hall of our castle of Nottingham, and to cover them externally with lead; and make a certain great louver [fumerium] on the same hall, and cover it with lead." Loggan's engravings of the halls of New College and Magdalen College show how these smoke holes were covered by a simple saddle roof, which looks like a portion of the main roof cut out and raised over the hole. In Loggan's Oxonia Illustrata saddle-like louvers appear only on the roofs of the earlier college halls. On the roofs of the later halls the saddle-like louver was replaced by a flèche or lantern, a Gothic development and one which the author of the Plan of St. Gall is not likely to have envisaged.12 12 The earliest flèche-shaped lantern over the smoke hole of a medieval hall known to me is that of Westminster Hall, "an exact copy of the original from the end of the fourteenth century"; see Parker, 1882, 39. For further specimens, see Atkinson, 1937, articles "Louver" and "Lantern," also 122, fig. 118; and Clapham and Godfrey, n.d., 131 and figs. 50 and 56 (turret-louver of Crosby Hall, 1466). 365. JEAN LE PRINCE. LES LAVANDIÈRES, 1770, PARIS ÉCOLE DES BEAUX-ARTS, COLLECTION ARMAND-VALTON (AFTER LE PAYSAGE FRANCAIS. 1926, PL. LV) The saddle-like version is the simpler and, unquestionably, the older form, and this type of fumerium is in my opinion what the author of the Plan had in mind when he used the term testu. MODERN SURVIVAL FORMS Superstructures of this type, almost extinct in the Old World, are a common feature of the timbered barns in the great farm belt of the United States (fig. 363). This device was brought over by early settlers, along with the very type of building for which it had been invented in the Early Iron Age. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of aisled American hay and dairy barns of timber are ventilated even today by openings in the roof ridge, which are shielded by elevated sections of the main roof and which still retain the shape of what in the Middle Ages was probably the most common means of controlling light and smoke. The design of such a device from a barn in the vicinity of Benicia, California (fig. 364), is probably as good a guide for the reconstruction of the louvers of the guest and service buildings on the Plan of St. Gall as any equivalent found in Europe, where this particular device disappeared rapidly in 366.

Despite a thorough search among Flemish, Dutch, and German landscape drawings, etchings, and paintings— media which have richly and vividly preserved the architectural panorama of the medieval countryside—I have been able to trace only a single case of survival in post-medieval architecture, and a belated one at that. In an ink drawing of 1770 by Jean le Prince, entitled Les Lavandières (fig. 365) there is shown in the center of the bridge that crosses a stream an old rectangular house with an opening in the ridge which is shielded by a raised portion of the main roof above the spot where in the period of construction of this house there must have burned an open fire. Together with the saddle-shaped superstructures over the ridge of the halls of New College and Magdalen College at Oxford, this drawing of Jean le Prince may retain the most truthful visual record of the device which in the guest and service buildings of the Plan is referred to as testu. 368. DUTCH BIBLE (UTRECHT, 1465) RUTH LYING WITH BOAZ VIENNA NATIONAL LIBRARY, ms. 2177, fol. 153v. [after Byvanck and Hoogewerff, I, 1922, 116.B] The details of the roof flaps und the curved levers by means of which they were opened and shut are clear enough to leave no doubt about their identity with the 18th-century examples shown in figs. 369 and 370. Observe in the background the haystack with a roof that can be lowered and raised, a Carolingian example of which is shown in fig. 326.F. HINGED HATCHES However, in the Lowlands during the sixteenth century, there existed a related device which, judging from the frequency of its appearance in the illuminations of the Grimani Breviary and other Franco-Flemish manuscripts of the same period, must also have been a common feature in late medieval house construction. A considerable number of houses represented in the landscapes of these manuscripts have smoke holes covered by wooden hatches hinged to the ridge, which could be raised or lowered by means of pulleys. This device appears in three different places in the Grimani Breviary: the July representation (fig. 366), the March representation, and the well-known February representation (fig. 367), in which a wisp of smoke can be distinguished rising in gentle spirals into the chilly winter air from an open fire burning directly below the smoke hole on the simple clay floor.13 13 Grimani Breviary, ed. Vries and Morpurgo, I, 1904, fols. 7v (July), 3v (March), 2v (February). The calendar section of this manuscript has also been published by François M. Kelly, n.d., pls. VII (July), III (March), II (February). In both these editions, which are in color, wisps of smoke are clearly visible. Again, it is depicted in the September representations of the breviary of the Museum Mayer van den Bergh at Antwerp14 14 See Gaspar-Haynes, 1932, pl. IX. and in an illustration, which depicts ROOF FLAPS ON AN 18TH-CENTURY FARM, THE NETHERLANDS 369. CROSS SECTION The roof flaps are shown in closed position, with cord arrangement visible. [after Uilkema, 1916, 21, fig. VII, and 27, fig. IX] A simple arrangement of cords and eyes or small blocks caused the right-hand cord to open the left-hand flap, and vice-versa. These cords were cleated off below to maintain the flap open which, when released, closed of their own weight. 370. EXTERIOR PERSPECTIVE One roof flap is open (the second is omitted from the drawing for clarity). the lying together of Ruth and Boaz, from a Dutch Bible illuminated around 1465 (fig. 368).15 15 Vienna, Nat. Lib., Ms. 2177, fol. 153v; see Byvanck and Hoogewerff, I, 1922, pl. 116B. The technical details of how such roof flaps were operated are well explained in the sketches of a vent of a Frisian farmhouse of the eighteenth century, published by K. Uilkema (figs. 369 and 370).16 16 Uilkema, 1916, 20, fig. VI; 21, fig. VII; 27, fig. IX. A wooden hatch or lid of this kind would be in complete accord with the term testu ("lid"), but the dimensions of many of the testu squares of the Plan of St. Gall, some of which are as large as 10 feet square (Hospice of the Paupers, House for Distinguished Guests), speak against this being the type used. Hinged lids of such dimensions would be unmanageable. The saddler roof is the simple and the earlier form, and for this reason in our reconstruction of the guest and service buildings on the Plan, we have chosen the latter version. V.7.2 CORNER FIREPLACES WITH CHIMNEYS A PREROGATIVE OF HIGHER-RANKING MEMBERS OF THE MONASTIC COMMUNITY In addition to the central open fireplace which forms the primary—and in the majority of houses, the only—source of heat, some of the guest and service buildings are provided with another device for heating individual rooms. Its symbol is an ovoid loop (fig. 371 A and B) always found in the corner of a room. In the Abbot's House, it is designated PLAN OF ST. GALL 371.A ABBOT'S HOUSE 371.B HOUSE FOR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS CORNER FIREPLACES Corner fireplaces with chimney stacks are installed in double-storied structures and in houses where the seclusion of separate living or bedrooms deprives occupants of the heat of the central fireplace (as in the House for Distinguished Guests). as caminata. Caminata (short, presumably, for camera caminata) is the medieval word for a room that has its own fireplace (caminus).17 17 Du Cange, II, 1937, 52: camera in quo caminus extat. Cf. also Murray, Dictionary II:1, 1893, 349. In this sense the term is used to indicate the bedrooms for distinguished guests (caminata cum lectis; fig. 371B) and the bedroom in the Porter's lodging (caminata portarii). By contrast, in the Abbot's living room as well as his bedroom, both of which are heated by corner fireplaces, the word caminata is inscribed into the interior of the loop-shaped symbol that indicates the presence of these heating devices, and therefore must have been used, in these two instances, as synonyms for caminus, i.e. the fireplace itself. Individual fireplaces indicated in this way on the Plan are found either in buildings having no central hearth, or in rooms separated from the common hall by wall partitions for the sake of greater privacy. Such fireplaces were the prerogative of the higher ranking members of the monastic polity and of the sick. They are primarily associated with masonry structures. Besides appearing in the Abbot's House, they are also found in the living quarters of the monastic officials next in rank: the Porter, the Master of 372. MESOPOTAMIA, PALACE OF MARI CORNER FIREPLACE, BEGINNING 2ND MILLENNIUM B.C. The stack of this earliest archaeologically attested corner fireplace was formed by tubes of fired clay whose curved flanges and conical shape allowed them to fit into one another. This ingenious flue at so early a period probably was used in houses of the aristocracy. the Outer School, the Master of the Novitiate, the Master of the Infirmary, and the Master of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers.18 18 The quarters of the Porter and of the Master of the Outer School are in the row of masonry structures which are built against the northern aisle of the Church, and in this row also are the living room and the dormitory for the Visiting Monks, both provided with corner fireplaces. The lodging of the Master of the Paupers' Hospice is built against the southern aisle of the Church, next to the Hospice itself. Of other ancillary structures of the central group of monastic buildings that are provided with corner fireplaces, one should mention the Sacristy and the Annex for the Preparation of the Holy Bread and the Holy Oil. For reasons of health they occur in all the sick wards (Novitiate, Infirmary, House for Bloodletting, House of the Physicians). They are found with less frequency in the guest and service buildings. Here again their presence is determined by considerations of rank or functional necessity. We find them in the bedrooms of the noblemen in the House for Distinguished Guests, in the bedrooms of the Physician and the Gardener. Conversely, they never occur in the buildings that accommodate the humbler members of the monastic community. They are completely absent from the houses for the workmen and craftsmen, the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers, and the houses that shelter serfs or livestock and their keepers. ETYMOLOGY AND SHAPE SUGGEST DERIVATION FROM THE OVEN Caminus comes from the Greek ????ν??, which meant an "oven, furnace, or kiln for smelting, baking, or burning 373. LE PUY-EN-VELAY (HAUTE-LOIRE), FRANCE WALL FIREPLACE, 12TH CENTURY One of the earliest and most elegant of the surviving medieval fireplaces, it is set against a flat wall, its conical hood constructed with consummate skill supported by cusped brackets rising from two short columns. earthenware and bricks."19 19 Liddell and Scott, 1953, 872. In classical Latin the term apparently had come to mean "a furnace which supplies the heat for a room or an apartment."20 20 Thesaurus Linguae Latinae, III, 1907, cols. 205-6; and Lewis and Short, 1945, 274. On the Plan of St. Gall it is used in this sense in connection with the large firing chambers (caminus ad calefaciendü) of the hypocausts which heated the Monks' Dormitory and Warming Room as well as the living and sleeping quarters of the novices and the sick. In medieval Latin caminus is the standard term for a wall or corner fireplace with a chimney, as may be inferred from Old High German glossaries, where it is translated both by "oven" (ofan) and "chimney" (scorenstein).21 21 Steinmeyer and Sievers, Glossen, III, 1895, 10, No. 51 (ofan); 418, No. 73 (eitoven); 384, No. 3 (scorenstein). The etymology of the term caminus—its original meaning of "kiln" or "oven" and its eventual change to mean chimney (French: cheminée; German: Kamin)—suggests that the medieval wall or corner fireplace is, developmentally, an offspring of the baker's oven or potter's kiln. This assumption makes sense for functional as well as etymological reasons. When the fire was moved against the wall, it had to be enclosed, and the age-old solution for enclosing a fire was the ovoid or round oven of the baker or potter. When the baking oven had, in this manner, been transformed into 374. FRANKFURT-AM-MAIN, GERMANY RÖMERTURM, CORNER FIREPLACE, 13TH CENTURY The hood has the shape of a beehive. Other examples of this design are found in the Berchfried of Castle Schönburg, near Naumburg (by some ascribed to the 11th century) and in the Berchfried of Petersberg near Freisach (see Piper, 1895, figs. 476 and 480). a heating unit that formed an integral part of the living room, the proper functioning of the fire and the health of the people whom it served required a smoke flue. At precisely what point in history this feature was introduced is as yet uncertain. 375. PLAN OF ST. GALL. CORNER FIREPLACE HOUSE FOR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS Our reconstruction of the corner fireplaces in the bedrooms of the guests is related to the design of the chimney shown in fig. 373. The hood masonry rests on a lintel fashioned by contilevered curved stones seated deep in the masonry, separated on corbels likewise deeply embedded. A voussior as illustrated, or a joint, may occur at center. TIME OF INVENTION OR ADOPTION IS PROBLEMATIC Moritz Heyne22 22 Heyne, I, 1899, 119. and Joseph Schepers23 23 Schepers, 1954, passim. ascribe its invention to the Romans, but this supposition has recently been shattered by André Parrot's extraordinary discovery of two fireplaces from the bathrooms of the Palace of Mari in Mesopotamia, which date from the beginning of the second millennium B.C. (fig. 372).24 24 Parrot, II, 1958, 201-5. The excavations were conducted as early as 1935-38, but publication of the results was delayed by World War II. The report does not comment in any manner upon the historical significance of these corner fireplaces found in rooms that also contained several bathtubs and privies. The smoke flues of these fireplaces consist of conical hoods encasing a vertical stack of tubular flue tiles, with an opening at the bottom for the fire which burned on a platform that formed a quarter of a circle. Hence the Romans cannot claim to be the first inventors of this device. They may have rediscovered it, but until a chimney-type Roman corner fireplace has actually been excavated—and so far no one has had the good fortune to find one—even this assumption must remain hypothetical. Conversely, it must be stressed that wall or corner fireplaces with chimneys were not a feature characteristic of Germanic house construction, and were not known at all in the northernmost areas held by Germanic peoples. We know this is so not only because of hundreds of house sites that have actually been 376.

SANNAP, HALLAND, SWEDEN [after Erixon, 1947, 426, fig. 545] CORNER FIREPLACE WITH OVEN SURMOUNTED BY CONICAL HOOD excavated, but also because, when chimneys were finally introduced at the Norwegian court during the reign of Olaf Kyrre (1067-93), this was an event so unusual that it was considered worthy of being recorded in Snorri's Lives of the Kings of Norway: "It was an old custom in Norway that the King's high seat was in the middle of the long bench. The ale was borne round the fire. King Olaf was the first to install corner fireplaces."25 25 "Þat var si?r forn í N'regi, at konungs hásæti var á mi?jum langpalli, var öl um eld borit; en Ólafr konungr lét fyrst gera sitt hásæti a hápalli um þvera stofu, hann lét ok fyrst gera ofnstofur" (Heimskringla, ed. Unger, 1868, 629; and in English translation by Monsen, 1932 576). (Ofnstofur, the Old Norse term, like the Latin caminus retains etymological consciousness of the fact that the masonry fireplace is an offspring of the oven !) Iceland resisted this innovation even longer. The first masonry-built Icelandic wall fireplace was constructed in 1316, in the timbered hall of Bishop Laurentius at Hólar.26 26 We can infer this from a passage in the Biskupa Sögur, where it is said of Bishop Laurentius that "he installed a stone fireplace [steinofn] in his timbered hall at Holum, such as they were wont to have in Norway, and made the chimney of that fireplace so large that he himself could sit down in it" (Biskopa Sögur, ed. Sigurdsson and Vigfusson, I, 1856, 830; for the date, Gudmundsson, 1889, 179-80). EARLIEST VISUAL &amp; LITERARY EVIDENCE IN MEDIEVAL EUROPE The Plan of St. Gall, to the best of my knowledge, offers the earliest visual evidence of the use in Europe of corner fireplaces with chimneys. Literary evidence, however, of such heating devices in individual rooms goes back as far as the sixth century. In 584, in connection with a donation to the church of St.-Marcellus ad Cabillonum (Châlons-sur-Saône), 378. MUSEÉ CONDÉ, CHANTILLY, FRANCE LES TRÈS RICHES HEURES DE JEAN DE FRANCE DUC DE BERRY. FEBRUARY: DETAIL. The miniature depicts rural life during the month of February, portraying a snow covered landscape with a farmhouse, a pigeon house and a stack of beehives. Inside the farmhouse the mistress and two servants warm themselves before a crackling fire. The hood and mantle of the fire place are built in masonry. The chimney shaft is braided in wicker-work, presumably daubed inside to prevent it from catching fire. The manuscript, one of the finest of its kind, was illuminated between 1411 and 1416 by Pol de Limburg, the most distinguished of a small group of Flemish artists who, trained in the tradition of French illumination of the fourteenth century, under the inspiration of contemporary Italian painting laid the foundations for the realistic style of the brothers van Eyck. the Frankish king Gunthram I directed the construction of a royal guesthouse (hospitole), the description of which (solarium cum caminata and lobia, galleried porch) is strikingly reminiscent of both the Abbot's House on the Plan of St. Gall and the royal residence at Anappes of the Brevium exempla.27 27 "Censemus ergo regalique authòritate roboramus, ut ibi manentes servi hospitale construant: solarium vero cum caminata, illi de Gergeyaco et de Alciato faciant: illi autem de Mercureis et de Canopis lobiam aedificiint" (Bréquigny, I, 1791, 79; the passage is quoted and discussed by Heyne, I, 1899, 75). EARLIEST EXTANT MEDIEVAL CORNER FIREPLACES The earliest extant Continental chimneys date from the twelfth century. They form niches in the masonry walls and are surmounted by conical hoods often braced at the sides by pillars and brackets. They are usually constructed on a full circular plan, the heating chamber forming the rearward, and the hood the forward, segment of the circle. Two typical examples of this species, dating from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, respectively, are found in Le Puyen-Velay (Haute-Loire), France (fig. 373)28 28 After Viollet-Le-Duc, III, 1868, 197, fig. 2. The fireplace is located in a vaulted room above the porch of St.-Jean which connects the northern forechoir aisle of the cathedral of Le Puy with its baptistery. See Guides Bleus, Cévennes, ed.

FORTIFIED ROMAN FRONTIER CAMP "PILLARED" HYPOCAUST [after Fusch, 1910, pl. xv] Although slow in making warmth felt in the rooms served by the system, the hypocaust had the great advantage, once the building was warmed by convection and conduction, of providing through radiation from walls and floor an even temperature for long periods of time, in relatively large spaces, using only a small amount of fuel. Ideally suited for the large warm and hot rooms of Roman baths, the hypocaust was used in the northern provinces of Rome almost universally in private homes.

III, 1908, 416 and III, 1925, 446) ascribes it to the thirteenth century. For additional German examples, see Piper, 1895, 487ff. The earliest English specimens are discussed in Lloyd, 3rd ed., 1951, 434ff. For further information see the forthcoming doctoral thesis "The Medieval Development of Fireplace and Chimney" by Leroy Dresbek, in process of being submitted at the University of California at Los Angeles (brought to my attention by Lynn White). This hooded circular fireplace, in my opinion, is the type that the draftsman of the Plan had in mind when he used ovoid symbols for the private heating units of the leading monastic officials and the monastery's distinguished guests (fig. 375). In this connection attention must be drawn to certain oven-shaped corner fireplaces still in use today in rural buildings of Sweden, two typical examples of which are given in figure 376 and 377.30 30 Erixon, 1947, 418ff. Both of these are, in fact, oven and fireplace combined. I do not doubt that the corner fireplaces of the Plan of St. Gall were intended to be built in masonry, although there is evidence for the existence in the Middle Ages of fireplaces with wooden hoods. A group of wooden chimneys, mounted on frames of oak and filled with wattle and daub, was published in Nathaniel Lloyd's History of the English House.31 31 Lloyd, op. cit., 347. For further literary evidence of fireplaces built of wood in Medieval England, see Crossley, 1951, 21. We may assume that fireplaces constructed entirely of wood or of both wood and stone were equally common on the Continent, because of their appearance in late medieval manuscripts and paintings. A typical example of this mixed technique is the fireplace of the farmer's house in the charming winter landscape of the February representation of Jean de France's Très Riches Heures (fig. 378),32 32 Durrieu, 1904, pl. II. and an example of a fireplace built entirely of wood is the one at the rear wall of a wooden cottage in the Livre du Cuer d'Amours Espris of René, Duke of Anjou.33 33 Smital and Winkler, 1926, pl. VII: Cuer Enters the Cottage of Melancholy. Another good example of a wooden medieval smoke flue may be found in Deutsche Kunst and Kultur im Germanischen National-Museum, 1952, 82 (Birth of Maria, altar wing by the Tirolese Master of the Uttenheim Panels, end of the fifteenth century). These medieval wall and corner fireplaces with wooden chimneys were, in my opinion, not an original conception, but rather an adaptation to Northern building materials, performed on a relatively humble social level, of a heating device that formed no part of the Northern building tradition. WESTWARD DIFFUSION FROM THE NEAR EAST BY-PASSING ROME? Roman custom of heating a house or its individual apartments by means of hypocausts stands in marked contrast to the open fire that burned on the floor of the Germanic house. The Roman heating unit was not only enclosed; it was concealed. The medieval open chimney combined the advantages of both; the fire was enclosed, as in the Roman type, and yet it was visible, as in the Germanic open fireplace. We do not know exactly when or where this combination 379.B ST.-REMY, BOUCHES-DU-RHÔNE (NEAR ARLES), FRANCE RUINS OF A "PILLARED" HYPOCAUST IN A HOUSE OF THE ROMAN SETTLEMENT OF GLANUM These two illustrations show typical use of the Roman hypocaust system in houses of transalpine Europe. No Roman villa of any significance in the vast stretches of land that extended from Provence to the borders of Scotland lacked such a facility. first took place. One might be tempted to guess that it occurred in an area where Roman and Germanic culture merged. But Parrot's discovery of corner fireplaces with chimneys in the Mesopotamian Palace of Mari, dating as early as the beginning of the second millennium B.C., suggests that we have to contend with a third influence, from the East. It is possible that the medieval wall or corner fireplace is a Near Eastern idea, cast into Roman masonry in Merovingian times, which permitted the installation of open fires in individual rooms, without endangering the safety of the building. Perhaps it was the close ties established between the Near East and the West through the monastic conquest of Merovingian Europe, in the fifth century, as well as the ubiquitous presence in the ports and inland cities of Gaul of Syrian, Egyptian and Jewish tradesmen that opened up the channels for the westward diffusion of this heating device which seems to have bypassed Rome.34 34 On the spread of eastern forms of monasticism in western Europe see Prinz, 1962. On the activities of Syrian, Egyptian and Jewish tradesmen in Merovingian Gaul, see Pirenne, 1937, 57ff. (English translation by Bernard Miall, 1968, 75ff). On the immigration of near-eastern intellectuals caused by the Arab conquest of Syria (634-636) and Egypt (640-642) see Pirenne, 1937, 62ff (English translation, 79ff). On the Syrian and Egyptian influence on the Art of the Migration period, see Holmqvist, 1939, 190ff. It is a well-known fact that even after the Moslems had closed the Mediterranean sea lanes pilgrims continued to flock to the holy places of Palestine (Pirenne, 1937, 143ff; English translation, 164ff). 380. SILCHESTER, HAMPSHIRE, ENGLAND Roman hypocaust of the channeled type. The floor of the room is removed to reveal the hypocaust substructure. This system, although not quite so common, was as widely diffused as the pillared type. [after Joyce, 1881, pl. vii] V.7.3 HYPOCAUSTS TWO TRADITIONAL ROMAN TYPES: CHANNELED AND PILLARED Since the history of the Roman hypocaust has been fully documented elsewhere, we may confine ourselves here to the most summary review.35 35 For a detailed treatment, see article "Hypocaustum" and bibliography, in Pauly-Wissowa, IX:1, 1914, cols. 333-36; for a more summary treatment, Singer, Holmgard, Hall, and Williams, II, 1956, 419ff. This heating system, developed to perfection by the Romans, is found not only in their baths but also in practically every Roman villa north of the Alps. The Roman hypocaust was either of the channeled or the pillared type.36 36 After Fusch, 1910. In the latter, a good example of which, from the Roman camp Saalburg, is shown in fig. 379, the floor of the room to be heated was raised by short columns, usually two feet high, a shallow chamber thus being formed below the floor level. The heat, generated in a furnace that was built against one of the outer walls and serviced from the outside, was dispersed into this chamber and rose from there in vertical flues imbedded in the walls. In the other type, hot air was taken from the furnace through a trench beneath the floor to the center of the room and then diverted radially to the four corners into a channel running all the way around the room, at the bottom of the walls, from which point it rose into the wall flues, as in the hypocaust from a building in block II of the Romano-British city of Silchester (fig. 380).37 37 On Silchester see James Gerald Joyce, 1881, 329ff. An interesting example of the channeled type has recently been excavated beneath the floor of an apsidal reception room in the late Roman Imperial villa at Konz, near Trier (fig. 241). It consisted of a firing chamber located more or less in the center beneath the room, serviceable from the outside by a narrow tunnel, and five large ducts fanning out toward the periphery of the room where they fork into smaller channels terminating in outlets in the four walls of the room. For a plan of the entire villa see I, p. 294, fig. 241A; for further details, see the excavation reports cited above, I, p. 317, note 27. THE CHANNELED HYPOCAUST OF THE MONKS' DORMITORY On the Plan of St. Gall only those parts of the hypocaust are shown which lie outside the warming rooms, namely the furnaces and the chimneys (fig. 381). We are told nothing about the layout of the ducts and flues that distributed the heat in the rooms themselves. To do this in the calefactory of the monks would have been impossible, as it would have obscured the layout of the beds in the Monk's Dormitory, which the drafter of the Plan considered to be of greater importance. But in the warming rooms of the Novitiate and the Infirmary, with no story above, he could have gone into detail. Since he chose not to do this, it then becomes clear that in his day the construction of a hypocaust 381.A PLAN OF ST. GALL. FIRING CHAMBER &amp; SMOKE STACK OF HYPOCAUST MONKS' WARMING ROOM see INDEX TO BUILDING NUMBERS OF THE PLAN VOL. I page xxv, VOL. III page 14 The hypocaust services a two-storied structure, 40 feet wide and 85 feet long, which contains on the ground floor the Monks' Warming Room and on the upper level the Dormitory. Of the heating system itself only the firing chamber and the smoke stack are shown. Their existence at two opposite ends of the building postulates the presence of a system of connecting ducts in the subfloor which provides for draft to distribute the heat and allows the smoke to escape through a smoke stack placed at a safe distance from the main structure. was a matter of common knowledge, one that required no further instruction. The furnaces are designated by the words fornax (cloister walk in front of the Monks' Calefactory), caminus ad calefaciend? (firing chamber of Monks' Calefactory), and camin' (Novitiate); the smoke flues, by euaporatio fumi (Monks' Calefactory) and exitus fumi (Novitiate). There is no reason to assume that the furnaces were meant to lie directly beneath the floor of the rooms they heated. Nowhere else on the Plan has the architect designated anything at the side of a building which was meant 381.B WARMING ROOM OF THE NOVITIATE see INDEX OF BUILDING NUMBERS OF THE PLAN Only one room of the Novitiate and Infirmary is heated by a hypocaust. Others of virtually identical dimensions are heated by corner fireplaces. The choice was clearly conditioned by the need for a room in each of these facilities with an even and constantly maintained temperature. 382.A PLAN OF ST. GALL: BAKING OVENS MONKS' BAKE AND BREWHOUSE The daily need for bread of the monastery's planned permanent inhabitants was 250 to 270 one-pound loaves. The oven in the Monks' Bakery with a diameter of 10 feet, could produce 300 to 350 loaves in one cycle of firing and baking (see p. 259 n. 26 for more detail). to be beneath it. External firing chambers, moreover, were traditional. Nor can there be any doubt about the location of the smoke flues. They are meant to be where they are shown: at a considerable distance from the outer walls of the buildings they served, in order to keep the smoke away from the windows of the dormitories and to reduce the danger of their roofs being ignited by glowing cinders. The hypocaust is superior as a heating system to the hearth or the corner fireplace when large rooms and many people are involved, since it is capable of distributing the heat evenly throughout the width and length of the building. On the Plan of St. Gall this heating system was provided for the rooms that served as general work and reading areas for the monks, the novices, and the sick.38 38 Cf. above, I, 253ff (Monks' Warming Room), I, 313ff (Warming Room of the Novices, ibid., (Warming Room of the Sick); also what Adalhard has to say on the use of the Warming Room, I, 258. Since in the Carolingian cloister, the dormitory was usually above a room warmed in this manner, the heat could be transmitted to it through openings in the ceiling or through wall flues. 382.B BAKE AND BREWHOUSE FOR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS see INDEX OF BUILDING NUMBERS OF THE PLAN VOL. I, page xxiv; VOL. III, p. 14 The oven of the House for Distinguished Guests, with a diameter of 7½ feet, could have produced easily in one cycle of firing and baking 200 to 250 one-pound loaves. The oven could therefore have accommodated the needs of the emperor and his complete entourage who might from time to time be expected to visit the monastery. As I do not know of any evidence for the existence in the Middle Ages of pillared hypocausts, I am inclined to assume that the hypocausts of the Plan of St. Gall belonged to the channeled type. The Carolingian hypocaust of the monastery of Reichenau, at any rate, belonged to this type, and this holds true also of the tenth-century hypocaust unearthed by Seebach at Pfalz Werla (fig. 209A-C).39 39 On the hypocausts of Reichenau and Pfalz Werla cf. above, I, 255. V.7.4 WINDOWS There is only one place on the Plan of St. Gall where windows are actually shown in the drawing: in the walls of the Scriptorium (fig. 99) where they are functionally of vital importance. The symbol used there, two short parallel strokes intersecting the wall at right angles, is identical with the one which the draftsman used to designate the 382.C BAKE AND BREWHOUSE FOR PILGRIMS AND PAUPERS The number of visitors expected to lodge each night in the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers may not have exceeded twelve (see below, p. 144). But if customs prevailing at the monastery of Corbie reflected general conditions, these transient guests were issued bread rations considerably larger than were allotted to the monastery's regular inhabitants: 3½ pounds per person upon arrival, and half that amount on departure. For a complement of twelve guests this distribution would amount to 63 pounds of bread each day. During the great religious festivals these amounts rose steeply as the number of travellers increased; even under ordinary conditions it would have been necessary to add to the needs of the overnight guests those of the transients who might stop for a noon meal and then move on. This explanation would account for the large size of the Hospice oven, its 7½-foot diameter being identical to the oven of the House for Distinguished Guests. presence of doors, except that in the case of the Scriptorium the line that defines the course of the walls is not interrupted by these strokes as it is in the majority of the entrances, doors, and exits. In other buildings, such as the Church, the Abbot's House, or the large complex that contains the Novitiate and the Infirmary and their chapels, windows were so clearly an integral part of the building type that the draftsman felt it unnecessary to go into any detail in this matter. In the case of the guest and service buildings, however, conditions were different. Traditionally, this type of house was not provided with windows. Lighting, ventilation, and 383.

BAKING OVEN 386.A 386.B BEGINNING OF 2ND MILLENNIUM B.C. smoke control, as we have seen, were regulated by an opening in the roof. This does not categorically preclude the use of wall windows. As the need for higher degrees of privacy led to the installation of corner fireplaces as secondary sources for heat in rooms that were segregated from the common hall by internal walls and ceilings, so the separation of these rooms from the central source of light made necessary the installation of supplementary devices for the admission of light and air. This could take the form either of wall windows or of dormer windows. In the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall, accordingly, we may have to take into account the entire range of possibilities, from complete absence of windows on the lower levels of dwellings (the houses of the serfs and the houses of the animals and their keepers) to the presence of some windows in the rooms of the higher-ranking monastic officials (such as the Gardener, the Physician, the Porter, 386.C ELEVATION OF OVEN OPENING PLAN AND SECTION The oven, located in the commoners' quarters, was 2 feet larger in diameter than that of the oven of the Monks' Bake and Brewhouse (fig. 382). It was built of both fired and unfired bricks set with mud joints—a technique that can be traced in the Near East to the middle of the 4th millenium B.C. The dome-shaped shell, presumably built in corbelled horizontal courses of brick, had collapsed. It rose from a well-preserved circular foundation of large bricks. The oven opening was formed by two arched courses of bricks radially set which survived in perfect condition. and the Master of the Outer School), and more elaborate fenestration on the highest level of dwelling (such as the House for Distinguished Guests; or in the Outer School, where supplementary light inlets were a functional necessity). The small squares in the cubicles for the students of the Outer School, as we shall subsequently show, must probably be interpreted as symbols for dormer windows. V.7.5 BAKING OVENS On the Plan of St. Gall there are three baking ovens (fig. 382A-C): one in the Monks' Bake and Brew House (caminus); one in the Bake and Brew House for Distinguished Guests (fornax); and one in the Bake and Brew House for Pilgrims and Paupers (fornax). They have diameters, respectively, of 10 feet, 7½ feet, and 7½ feet. 387. KARKÓW, POLAND. BEHAIM CODEX (1505). BAKEHOUSE WITH OVEN, KETTLE, AND KNEADING TABLES JAGIELLONIAN UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, CODEX PICTURATUS, fol. 246. [after Winkler, 1941, Pl. 4] The Behaim Codex is a compilation of privileges, oath formulae, and guild ordinances written in German. It is named from an annotation on the title page by the clerk and notary of Kraków, Balthasar Behaim (d. 1508), which reads: Anno domini 1505 consummatum. Written and illuminated in strong and radiant colors by a local artist, doubtlessly of German descent, the manuscript has stylistic roots in a school of illumination that flourished in Augsburg and Nürnburg, and was strongly influenced by the work of Albrecht Dürer. The representation of the bakehouse appears on folio 246. Its title is written in bold red letters. (Winklers' color plate suggests that the roof may have been sheeted in copper.) 388. TÜBINGEN, WURTTEMBURG, GERMANY. UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, CODEX M. D. 2, fol. 29V This detail shows the planet-children of Saturn in furious, cheerful dispatch of the tasks of baking: milling, kneading dough and setting loaves to rise, loading the familiar domed oven. Pastries may have been the fate of the caged birds. (Panofsky and Saxl treat the complex iconography of this illumination in Dürer's "Melencolia I", Leipzig, 1923, 61 [Studien der Bibliothek Warburg]. The codex dates to the late 15th century. The baking of bread is one of the most ancient of human arts. Calcined remains of unleavened bread made from crushed grain were found in Swiss lake dwellings that date from the early Stone Age.40 40 See Schuchhardt, 1939, 44ff. Reference by implication to the custom of leavening (i.e., admixing to the dough a substance that produces gases, thus causing the bread to rise) is made in Genesis, where it is said of Lot that "he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread."41 41 Gen. 19:3. One very early baking method, perhaps the first devised, was that of placing the dough on a heated flat or convex stone and covering it with hot ashes.42 42 Maspero, 1914, 13. The size and number of loaves that could be baked in this manner was limited by the shape of the stone. To bake in quantity required the invention of the oven, a round or ovoid chamber that held the heat and allowed it to be distributed over a wider surface. One of the earliest Central European ovens was excavated in the Stone Age settlement of Taubried, on Lake Federsee, Germany (fig. 383).43 43 Schuchhardt, 1939, 45, fig. 48; and Reinerth, 1936, 94, fig. 36, and pl. XIX. The walls of the baking chamber were made of daubed wattle. The opening in front was covered with a removable shutter, probably of wood and cloth. Between the third millennium B.C. and the middle of the nineteenth century A.D., neither the shape of the oven nor the method of baking changed significantly. A circular oven of baked brick, dating from the beginning of the second millennium B.C., was found by André Parrot44 44 Parrot, II, 1958, 232. during his excavation of the Palace of Mari, Mesopotamia, (fig. 386) in a bathroom of the quarters of the superintendent of the palace (cf. fig. 372). A Roman oven shaped exactly like this one is shown on a frieze of the monument of the baker Eurysaces at Rome, dating from the first century B.C. (fig. 385).45 45 After Singer, Holmyard, Hall, and Williams, II, 1956, 118, fig. 88. On the left, the baker is placing the loaves in the oven. On the right, four men are kneading dough on a table. 389. A, B, C, D PLAN OF ST. GALL. KITCHEN STOVES AND BREWING RANGES In each building the stove is indicated as a square, with or without openings for pots; in all probability the "fornax super arcus" of the Monks' Kitchen was the type in the other kitchens. The brewing ranges show corner openings for vats. The association of baking and brewing facilities under one roof is traditional and consistent on the Plan; functional interdependence of the two crafts can be shown (see below, pp. 249ff). Primitive clay ovens of the Taubried type (fig. 383) are still in use today46 46 Modern German examples are featured in Reinerth, II, 1940, pl. 348. and were unquestionably common in medieval times. Figure 384 shows the reconstruction of a Langobardic oven of this type from the first century A.D.47 47 After Adrian, 1951, 69, fig. 5. A handsome illustration in the Behaim Codex in Krakow (fig. 387)48 48 Winkler, 1941, pl. 4. shows the baker placing the loaves in the oven, his helper shaping them, and a woman throwing some salt or herbs into the dough rising in a kettle on the floor in front of the oven. The oven is built into the corner of this copper-roofed shed. The smoke rises from a round hole in the top of the oven and passes through a dormer window in the roof out into the open. Figure 388 shows a baking scene that occurs among the representations of the planet children of Saturn in a manuscript in the University Library at Tübingen.49 49 Tübingen, Univ. Bibl., Cod. M.d.2, fol. 29V. See Spamer, 1935, 39. Here again the smoke escapes through circular openings in the top of the baking chamber. Ovens of this same design are found in other medieval illuminations.50 50 I cite as typical examples the representations of ovens in the Sachsenspiegel (von Künssberg, 1934, 59) and a Hebrew manuscript of 1480-1500 (Anzeiger für Kunde deutscher Vorzeit, 1880, vol. 5 fig. 6). 389. E, F, G PLAN OF ST. GALL. KITCHEN STOVES AND BREWING RANGES But an oven with a chimney is shown in the December representation of the Grimani Breviary.51 51 Grimani Breviary, ed. Ongania, 1906, pl. 24. In conformity with the pictorial tradition reviewed above, we have reconstructed the St. Gall ovens as more or less circular chambers, the larger one with a smoke flue, the two smaller ones without (cf. figs. 402 and 394). V.7.6 KITCHEN STOVES AND KETTLES Square cooking ranges, resting on arches, with firing chambers beneath and openings for pots on the surface are designated for the kitchens on the Plan. Only one of them, the stove in the Monks' Kitchen, has an explanatory title (fornax super arcus) (fig. 389A). It is 7½ feet square. The other kitchen stoves—House for Distinguished Guests (fig. 389B), Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers (fig. 389C), Novitiate and Infirmary (figs. 389D,E)—are about 5 feet square. We may assume, I think, that their design was the same as that of the stove in the Monks' Kitchen discussed earlier.52 52 See I, 284ff. This type of stove was also used in the brew-house (fig. 389F,G). It is possible that a cooking area for the serfs and laymen is to be found in the living room of the House for Horses and Oxen and Their Keepers, and that the H-shaped symbol was intended to mean an open fireplace with kettles suspended on cranes. The circles around the larger stoves (fig. 389A,F,G) were undoubtedly meant to indicate tubs or kettles, and these may have belonged to any of the varieties shown in figures 210, 390, and 400. V. 8 FACILITIES FOR THE RECEPTION OF VISITORS V.8.1 THE MULTIFARIOUS ACCOMMODATIONS The reception and care of guests, wealthy and poor, was one of the primary duties of a monastic community. About the proper performance of this service St. Benedict spoke in emphatic terms: "Let all guests that come be received like Christ, for he will say I was a stranger and ye took me in."1 1 "Omnes superuenientes hospites tamquam Christus suscipiantur, quia ipse dicturus est: Hospis fui et suscepistis me." Benedicti Regula, chap. 53, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 123; McCann, 1952, 118; Steidel, 1952, 257. The prototypical biblical hospitality is that which Abraham extended to the Trinity in Genesis XVIII which as Charles W. Jones reminds me, had a lasting effect on the Palestinian hosts Jerome, Rufinus and others and through them on the West. He asks that "fitting honors be shown to all," but especially to churchmen and pilgrims2 2 "Et omnibus congruus honor exhibeatur, maxime domesticis fidei et peregrinis", ed. Hanslik, loc. cit; McCann, loc. cit.; Steidel, loc. cit. and demands that special care be given to the reception of the poor "because in them is Christ more truly welcomed; for the fear which the rich inspire is enough in itself to secure them honor."3 3 "Pauperum et peregrinorum maxime susceptioni cura sollicite exhibeatur, quia in ipsis magis Christus suscipitur; nam diuitum terror ipse sibi exigit honorum" (ibid.). ed. Hanslik, op. cit., 124; McCann, op. cit., 120; Steidle, op. cit., 258. He rules that the guests be served from a separate kitchen, "so that the brethren may not be disturbed when guests arrive at irregular hours,"4 4 "Coquina abbatis et hospitum super se sit, ut incertis horis superuenientes hospites, qui numquam desunt monasterio, non inquietentur fratres" (ibid.). and he places the responsibility for the reception of the visitors in the hands of the Porter.5 5 Cf. below, p. 153. 390. LUTTRELL PSALTER LONDON, BRITISH MUSEUM. ADD. MS. 42130, fol. 207 [after Millar, 1932, pl. 166] The open kettles in this margin illumination appear to be supported on stands, with open fires below them. The arcuated ranges of the Plan were considerably more sophisticated; the Luttrell Psalter illuminations date to 1340. The protection of paupers and pilgrims was also a concern of the secular ruler—a responsibility that the emperor had taken upon himself through his coronation in Rome, as the holder of a universal power that obliged him to protect and promote the Christian faith. It is defined as such in a capitulary issued by Charlemagne in 802: "That no one shall presume to rob or do any injury fraudulently to the churches of God or widows or orphans or pilgrims; for the lord emperor himself, after God and His saints, has constituted himself their protector and defender."6 6 Capitulare missorum generale, 802, chap. 5, Mon. Germ., Legum II, Capit. I, ed. Boretius, 1883, 93: "Ut sanctis ecclesiis Dei neque viduis neque orphanis neque peregrinis fraude vel rapinam vel aliquit iniuriae quis facere presumat: quia ipse domnus imperator, post Domini et sanctis eius, eorum et protector et defensor esse constitutus est." Cf. Ganshof, 1963, 64, 74, 96. The case for the poor is re-emphasized in a special capitulary of the same year, see Boretius, op. cit., 99-102, and Eckhardt, 1956. For a complete English translation of the general capitulary of 802 see "Selections from the Laws of Charles the Great," ed. Munro, 1900, 16-33. On the Plan of St. Gall there are no fewer than seven separate installations devoted to monastic hospitality and its administration. Listed in the order of prominence with which they were associated in the thinking of St. Benedict they are: 1 The Lodging for Visiting Monks 2 The Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers, with an annex containing the Kitchen, the Bake and Brew House for the Pilgrims and Paupers 3 The Lodging of the Master of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers 4 The Porter's Lodging 5 The House for Distinguished Guests, with annex containing the Kitchen, Bake and Brew House for the Distinguished Guests 6 The House for Servants of Outlying Estates and for Servants Traveling with the Emperor's Court 7 The House for the Vassals and Knights who travel in the Emperor's Following 391. PLAN OF ST. GALL LODGING FOR VISITING MONKS Like the Monks' Dormitory lying on the opposite side of the Church (I, 260, fig. 208), the quarters for visiting monks communicate directly with the transept and are accessible only from within the Church. The six beds in the lodging accord in number with the seats available in the Refectory (I, 263, fig. 211) at a table in front of the reader's lectern reserved for visitors. The visiting monks have available for recreation an outdoor space, probably gardened, 7½ feet wide and 80 feet long, which serves as a buffer between their quarters and the adjacent enclosure of the Outer School (fig. 409, p. 174). In order to attend religious services, students and teachers in the Outer School would have crossed this outdoor area for visiting monks, thence passing through the eastern end of their living room. Like the nearby quarters of the Master of the Outer School and the Porter, the Lodging of Visiting Monks must have been at ground-floor level, doubtless a lean-to the roof of which could not have risen above the sills of the north aisle windows of the Church (I, 165-66, figs 111-112). The visitors' living room and dormitory were equipped with corner fireplaces. Also intrinsically geared to the reception of visitors is the atrium in front of the western end of the Church, and in a very specific sense: the three porches attached to it in the west, the south, and the north are where the guests are formally received, screened, and distributed to their respective quarters. V.8.2 LODGING FOR VISITING MONKS The synod of 817 prescribed that each monastery should be provided with special quarters for the reception of the visiting monks: "Ut dormitorium iuxta oratorium constituatur ubi superuenientes monachi dormiant."7 7 Synodi Secundae Decr. Auth., chap. 24, ed. Semmler, in Corp. Cons. Mon., I, 1963, 478. Hildemar, in his commentary on the Rule of St. Benedict (written between 845 and 850 at the monastery of Civate in Italy), furnishes us with some further detail on this subject.8 8 As pointed out by Hafner, in Studien, 1962, 177ff. The brothers, he tells us, should never be quartered with any laymen (not even with the vassalli by whom they may be accompanied) as the latter often stay awake until midnight, passing their time in idle talking and jesting, while the monks should spend it in silence and prayer.9 9 Expositio Hildemari, ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 611: quia dormitorium, ubi monachi suscipi debent, habetur separatum a laicorum cubiculo, i.e. ubi laici jacent, eo quod laici possunt stare usque mediam noctem et loqui et jocari, et monachi non debent, sed magis silentium habere et orare. For this reason their Dormitory should be next to the church, so that they can enter the sanctuary at any time of the day and night.10 10 Ibid., 612: Ideo juxta oratorium illorum monachorum hospitum est dormitorium, ubi ipsi jaceant soli reverenter, et possint nocte surgere, qua hora velint, et ire in ecclesiam. In compliance with these stipulations a Lodging for Visiting Monks is established on the Plan of St. Gall, in the corner between the northern transept arm and the northern aisle of the Church (fig. 391). It consists of a long and narrow apartment, 10 feet wide and 50 feet long, which is internally divided into a living room (susceptio fr?m? supuenientium) and a dormitory (dormitori? eorum), both of equal dimensions. The living room is furnished with two wall benches and from it direct access is gained to the Church through a door which leads into the northern transept arm. The dormitory has a privy attached to it (necessarium); and the number of beds that it contains suggests that the maximum number of daily visitors who could be expected from other convents was six. PLAN OF ST. GALL 392. 391.X HOSPICE FOR PILGRIMS AND PAUPERS Installation of auxiliary services in annexes to the main houses characterizes all facilities of the Plan of St. Gall associated with potential fire hazards: the tasks of baking, brewing, cooking, blacksmithing, and goldsmithing (figs 292, 396, 419-421, and 462, below). The narrow shape of the Lodging for Visiting Monks— like that of the Lodging of the Master of the Outer School, which lies next to it, and that of the Porter's Lodging which follows—suggests that all of these apartments are installed in a narrow lean-to, built against the northern aisle of the Church (figs. 108, 112 and 191). The visiting monks take their meal in the Refectory for the regular monks, where a table for guests is set aside for that special purpose.11 11 Cf. I, 268. If one among the visiting brothers decides to stay longer, or is a familiaris, Hildemar tell us, he will join into the life of the regular monks, sleep and eat with them, read in the claustrum, and attend the chapter meetings in the morning and evening.12 12 Expositio Hildemari, ed. cit., 582: Si est familiaris monachus, in dormitorio monachorum dormit et in claustra cum aliis monachis legit et in refectorio manducat et mane et ad capitulum venit fratrum. On Irish monks and abbots who, on their way back from Rome decided to stay in St. Gall, see Meyer von Knonau's commentary on Ekkeharti (IV). Casus sancti Galli, chap. 2, pp. 9-10, notes 33 and 34. They are recorded as Scotti or Scotigenae in the death lists. The most famous of these is Moengal-Marcellus, (Notker's teacher) who visited the monastery "of his compatriot St. Gall" (Gallum compatriotam suum) together with his uncle, and stayed behind when the latter left, to become one of the monastery's most illustrious teachers. The Lodging for Visiting Monks may also on occasion have been used by one or the other of the regular monks when, after a long absence, he returned from a journey or from some other task that took him away from the mother house.13 13 Ibid., 612.2. PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOSPICE FOR PILGRIMS AND PAUPERS 393.B LONGITUDINAL SECTION The presumption in these reconstructions is that the roof was supported by a frame of freestanding inner posts connected lengthwise by roof plates and crosswise by tie beams (cf. fig. 393.D). The rafters rise in two tiers, the lower from wall plates to roof plate, the upper, at a slightly steeper angle, from the roof plates to the ridge. 393.A PLAN For historical justification of the reconstructions shown in this series of illustrations we refer to pages 72-82 above, where it has been shown that the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall belong to a vernacular building tradition traceable in the Germanic territories of the Lowlands to the 14th century B.C. The traditional material for this building type was timber. All the guest and service buildings of the Plan were freestanding; in reconstructing their plans and elevations, we have used the simple lines of the Plan as indicating their interior dimensions. The elevations shown here are purely conjectural but based on the assumption of comfortable minimum heights required by the functions of each component of the building. Carpentry details derive from later medieval buildings (see above, pages 88ff). AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOSPICE FOR PILGRIMS AND PAUPERS 393.C EAST ELEVATION The roof lines might have been straight. We have chosen to show them broken, because they thus reflect more clearly in the exterior appearance of the building the composition and boundary lines of its inner spaces. To hip the roof over the narrow ends of the building is a sound constructional assumption, since it steadies the roof in the longitudinal orientation and is a feature archaeologically well attested as early as the Iron Age. 393.D TRANSVERSE SECTION 393.E NORTH ELEVATION AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION PLAN OF ST. GALL. LODGING OF THE MASTER OF THE HOSPICE FOR PILGRIMS &amp; PAUPERS 394.A 394.B The nature of his duties required that the caretaker of the poor have his own lodging, a simple rectangular room with corner fireplace installed as a lean-to abutting the south aisle of the church and about 15 feet from the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers. The porch through which pilgrims and paupers entered was an access to be shared by them with the monastery's workmen and tradesmen, and by other lay visitors such as relatives of the brothers, who might enter through that porch and then converse with their kin in the Monks' Parlor next to and east of the Hospice. No outsider went beyond this Parlor without escort. The Master of the Hospice was assisted by servants lodged in the eastern aisle of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers. The suggested circulation patterns show with what relative ease the congress of the monastery with the world might be controlled. Confined on the east by the Cellar wall and on the south by a (presumptive) fence, travelers could enter the areas around the Hospice, dine in the house provided for their needs, rest, exchange news and gossip of the day, and move on, all without disturbing the more orderly life going forward in the calm heart of the monastery. * 1.

V.8.3 HOSPICE FOR PILGRIMS AND PAUPERS THE MAIN HOUSE The Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers (fig. 392) lies to the south of the Church and west of the cloister in a yard that is bounded to the east by the Monks' Cellar and Larder, to the south and west by fences that separate the pilgrims and paupers from the houses for the livestock and their keepers, and to the north by the semicircular atrium of the Church. Access to this yard is gained by a porch built against the southern wall of the atrium, which also serves as entrance for the monastery's servants. The house is identified by the hexameter, "Here let the throng of pilgrims find friendly reception" (hic peregrinorum la&amp;etur turba recepta). The Hospice is composed of a main house for the reception of the pilgrims and paupers, and an annex containing kitchen, bakery, and brewing facilities. The main house measures 50 by 60 feet. It has in its center a large rectangular room that is designated as "living room" or "hall for the pilgrims and paupers" (domus peregrinorum et pauper?m). This space must also have served as dining room, as may be gathered from the benches that run all around its circumference. The draftsman did not enter the tables, but the meaning of this seating arrangement is clear from the corresponding space in the House for Distinguished Guests. The house receives its warmth from a large central fireplace, and the smoke escapes through a louver (testu) in the roof above it.14 14 With regard to the meaning of this term, cf. above pp. 117ff. Keller's (1844, 27) and Willis' (1848, 108-9) assertion that the Hospice of the Paupers is devoid of a fireplace and a dining room is based on an untenable interpretation of the square in the center of this house, designated with the word testu, as a "garden hut," and on a misunderstanding of the term domus, which does not refer to the whole of the house but only to the common hall for the pilgrims and paupers in the center of the house. Cf. above pp. 77-78. Two rooms on the front side of the house are used as quarters for the servants (seruientium mansiones), two corresponding rooms at the rear as "supply room" (camera) and "cellar" (cellarium). The spaces under the lean-to's on the narrow sides of the house serve as dormitories for the pilgrims and paupers (dormitorium and aliud). The Statutes of Adalhard, written at about the same time (822) that the Plan of St. Gall was drawn, make it clear that the normal number of pilgrims expected to spend the night in the monastery of Corbie was twelve15 15 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 2, ed. Semmler, in Corp. Cons. Mon., I, 1963, 372: duodecim pauperes qui supra noctem ibi manent. —this corresponds quite closely to the number of pilgrims who could be housed in the rooms which in the Plan of St. Gall are designated as dormitories for pilgrims. They are capable of accommodating eight beds each, ranging in a single row all around the walls of the room. But, in an emergency, of course, the bedding capacity of the Hospice for the paupers could be increased by a wide margin, if the benches in the hall were used as additional facilities for sleeping. The Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers is wanting of that other convenience so profusely attached to the houses that shelter the upper social strata of the monastic community: the privy. I have already had occasion to remark that I do not think that this is an oversight.16 16 Cf. I, 73 and below pp. 304ff. PLAN OF ST. GALL. LODGING OF THE PORTER 395.A 395.B The Porter's Lodging, with its corner fireplace, private privy, quarters for as many as five assistants, and garden, reflects the importance of this official in monastic life; his quarters were nearly twice the size of those of the Master of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers, his subordinate. St. Benedict stipulated that the Porter be selected with special care, for he was charged with the reception of all guests and the distribution of food and services to fill all their needs. His role was diplomat and administrator. In particular his duties were to identify and greet distinguished guests of the monastery and their retinues, and then see to their escort through the north reception porch into the grounds and quarters provided for them in the House for Distinguished Guests and its Annex. Guests of high social standing might have business with the internal life of the monastery, but their reception area, though larger and better appointed than that for pilgrims and paupers, was likewise closed off from any direct access to the inner monastery grounds; similarly, unnecessary contact of such guests with the less exalted class of traveler lodged upon the south was by these arrangements largely precluded. * 1.

Bakery- BH Brewery- 11. House for Distinguished Guests- DH Dining Hall. We have reconstructed the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers as a large rectangular hall with central hearth and louver in the roof above it, the hall being surrounded on all four sides by aisles or lean-to's (fig. 393A-E). In view of the constructional characteristics of the genus of houses to which the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall historically belong, it is reasonable to assume that the roof of this, as well as of all other related houses of the Plan, is carried by a frame of timber, consisting of two rows of posts connected crosswise by tie beams and lengthwise by post plates. The natural and historical place for alignment for these two rows of posts are the lines that define the boundaries between the aisles and the central hall of the house. Since the Plan does not designate the location of the structural members in this type of house, but confines itself merely to delineating the boundaries of its component spaces, we know nothing about the respective distances of the roof-supporting posts. Ours are purely conjectural. There is a variety of other possibilities. As there is only one source of heat for both the hall and the peripheral spaces, the latter can only have been partially boarded off against the center hall. The separating wall paneling may not have risen much higher than the backrest of the benches that surround the hall. We have reconstructed the roof as a simple rafter roof (of the type exemplified by St. Mary's Hospital in Chichester, figs. 341-343), but the roof might have belonged as well to the family of purlin roofs. We are well informed about the function and management of the Hospice for Paupers through the Administrative Directives of Adalhard of Corbie.17 17 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 5, ed. cit., 372-74 and translation in III, 105-106. The management of the Hospice for Paupers, we learn from this account, was in the hands of the Hosteler (hostellarius) who was subject to the directives of the Porter (portarius). On the Plan of St. Gall the Hosteler is accommodated in a special apartment which abuts the southern aisle of the church immediately to the side of the Hospice for Paupers. The rooms that are designated camera and cellarium in the Hospice for Paupers are the Hosteler's food and supply rooms. Adalhard orders that each pilgrim was to receive, each day, a loaf of bread, weighing 3½ pounds and made of a mixture of wheat and rye, and that on his departure he was to be issued half a loaf of the same kind for his journey. 396. PLAN OF ST. GALL HOUSE FOR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS, WITH ANNEX CONTAINING KITCHEN, BAKE &amp; BREWING FACILITIES The layout of this structure is in its basic dispositions the same as the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers. It also consists of a main house with an annex to accommodate services involving fire hazards. Likewise the main house here consists of a central hall for dining and a subsidiary suite of outer rooms used for sleeping, the accommodation of servants, and when appropriate, even horses. But the layout of the House for Distinguished Guests is more explicit than its humbler counterpart. Here with great precision is portrayed placement of tables and benches in the center hall, as well as the furnishings in bedrooms of the Distinguished Guests. These rooms are provided with corner fireplaces, making their comfort independent of the open fireplace in the middle of the center hall, and thus affording their occupants the luxury of privacy. The presence of these corner fireplaces induced us to assume that the outer walls of this house were intended to be of masonry. The use of masonry and timber in a royal Carolingian hall is well attested through an important literary source, the Brevium Exempla (p. 36ff, above), where the DOMUS REGALIS of an unnamed estate near Annapes is described as being constructed in timber "in the usual fashion." This remark reveals that wood was the more common and traditional material for this house type. Hipped roofs are attested for the windswept continental coastlands of the North Sea from the 7th century B.C. onward (figs. 295-297 and 314, above) and became a permanent trait of rural architecture north of the Alps (figs. 335-336, above). Windows are not part of the customary design of this house type. They became an indispensable adjunct when its outer rooms were partitioned, separating them from the only other traditional light source: the lantern-covered opening in the roof ridge. Such was the case with the bedrooms of the distinguished guests under the lean-to's of the two end bays of the house, and perhaps even with the servants quarters to the left and right of the door, in the middle of the southern long wall. This door is the only means of access to the house, and through it both men and animals were intended to pass. It leads to a vestibule which gives lateral access to the servants' quarters, and axially, to the large living and dining hall that forms the center of the house, and from which all other rooms, including the servants' privy, are reached.

HOUSE FOR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS AUTHORS' RECONSTRUCTION This perspective shows the large center nave of the house, the communal living and dining area, and bedrooms of servants to the left, with stables to the right. Tables and benches ranged around the walls of the center space presumably could be rearranged to meet particular needs of a group of guests, or moved back altogether when not in use. In each building of the Plan housing both animals and men, the layout is similar: servants' quarters flank (or guard) the entrance while animals pass through the common room to the rear. This disposition may reflect a defensive posture of ancient antecedents. In the House for Distinguished Guests it had the further convenience of proximity to the privy where, as an amenity afforded guests of high rank, refuse and manure from the stables might be readily disposed of. Carpentry details shown here derive from later medieval examples (cf. page 115ff, above); but the concept of a timber-framed roof dividing the house into nave, aisles, and bays, is clearly in the historical tradition of the Germanic all-purpose house to which the preceding chapters have been devoted. This exterior view shows, in the left foreground of the main house, the privy for servants and guards. In the right background lies the annex containing kitchen, baking, and brewing facilities. Bedrooms for distinguished guests, with individual corner fireplaces and private toilets, are under the hips of the roof on the two narrow sides of the house. Stables are in the northern aisle parallel to the servants' privy. Bedrooms of the latter are on the entrance side (not visible here). 399. ST. GALL HOUSE FOR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS; ALSO ITS KITCHEN, BAKE, AND BREW HOUSE Paupers arriving and leaving on the same day were to be issued a quarter loaf of bread per head. The daily ration in the Hospice also included two tankards of beer, but whether or not any wine could be served was left to the judgment of the prior. Special consideration was to be given to the sick pilgrims, and to those who came from distant lands, for whom the Hosteller could draw additional rations "so that he should not incur any shortages in his normal allotments." Provisions not spent on the days when the number of visitors fell below the expected norm were to be saved and used as a surplus to be drawn against on days when the norm was exceeded. Adalhard specifies the source and volume of beans, lard, and cheese, as well as the amount of eel and meat, and all of the other indispensible items, not omitting the "old clothes and shoes of the monks, which the Hosteler receives from the Chamberlain for distribution to the paupers as is customary." He lists the amount of money that should be distributed among the poor, pointing out that no rigidly binding rules could be established in this delicate matter where varying needs require varying action, and he terminates this chapter of his statute with the wistful admonition: "We therefore beseech all those upon whom this office will be bestowed in our monastery that, in their generosity and distribution, they bow to the will of God rather than to their own parsimoniousness, since everyone is to be rewarded according to the pattern he has set for himself."18 18 Ibid., 374. THE KITCHEN, BAKE AND BREW HOUSE FOR PILGRIMS AND PAUPERS The Kitchen, Bake and Brew House for Pilgrims and Paupers lies ten feet west of the Hospice, and covers a surface area of 22½ feet by 60 feet. Its layout repeats on a 400. PLAN OF ST. GALL KITCHEN, BAKE AND BREWHOUSE FOR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS. AUTHORS' RECONSTRUCTION OF ROOF FRAMING, WITH SOME TIMBERS REMOVED A widened aisle forms an extended lean-to accommodating kitchen and larder on either side of the entrance. The wall plate for the main space of the house provides footing for rafters over this enlarged lean-to. In the nave space are the oven, kneading troughs, and tables for shaping loaves. At right are the brewing range and four tubs or cauldrons for steeping brew. The narrow aisle beyond and to the rear (its interior not visible here) is of conventional width in relation to the main space, and houses at one end containers for cooling beer and at the other, troughs for leavening dough. smaller scale that of the Bake and Brew House of the Monks, which shall be discussed later on. But it combines with the facilities for brewing (bracitori?) and baking (pistrin?) a stove for cooking. This is the meaning that must be attributed to the square in the bakery immediately in front of the baking oven (fornax), which is internally divided into four more squares by two lines crossing each other at right angles. The same symbol is used for the stove in the Kitchen for the Distinguished Guests.19 19 See below, p. 165. Keller (1844, 27) and Willis (1848, 108-9) overlooked this fact and based upon this `oversight' the erroneous conclusion that the Hospice was not furnished with a kitchen. Charles W. Jones reminds me, in this context, of a passage in the Directives of Abbot Adalhard of Corbie containing a strong hint that at Corbie too, the poor had their own kitchen: "According to custom the porter should provide firewood for the poor, or other things which are not recorded here, such as the kettle or dishes or other things that are in their quarters". See III, 106, and Consuetudines Corbeienses, ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 374. There, in the center, of a room, explicitly defined as "kitchen" (culina), its meaning is unequivocal. The facilities for cooling the beer (ad refrigerand? ceruis?) and for leavening the bread (locus conspergendi) are installed in the aisle that runs along the western side of the house. The equipment is identical with that of the Bake and Brew House of the Monks, and the design and construction of the house must also have been very similar. V.8.4 LODGING OF THE MASTER OF THE HOSPICE FOR PILGRIMS AND PAUPERS The management of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers was the responsibility of a monastic official to whom the Plan of St. Gall refers as "the caretaker of the poor" (procurator pauperum).20 20 The word procurator has faded so severely that it is barely legible. In the Administrative Directives of Abbot Adalhard of Corbie the same official is referred to as hospitalarius. See Consuetudines Corbeienses, ed. cit., 372. His lodging (pausatio procuratoris pauperum) lies immediately to the north of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers, between the south porch of the atrium and the Monks' Parlor (fig. 394). It is an oblong chamber, 10 feet wide and 25 feet long, which is built against the southern aisle of the Church, doubtless in the form of a lean-to. It is provided with a corner fireplace and doors that connect it with both the court and the southern aisle of the Church. The Master of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers is a subordinate of the Porter. V.8.5 LODGING FOR THE PORTER At the gate of the monastery let there be placed a wise old man who understands how to give and receive a message, and whose years will keep him from leaving his post. This porter should have a room near the gate, so that those who come may always find someone to answer them. As soon as anyone knocks, or a poor man hails him, let him answer Deo gratias or Benedic. Then let him attend to them promptly, with all the gentleness of the fear of God and with fervent charity. If the porter needs help, let him have one of the younger brethren.21 21 Benedicti Regula, chap. 66, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 155-57; McCann, 1952, 152-53; Steidle, 1952, 320-21. The Porter was in charge not only of the reception of the monastery's guests, but also of providing them with food and bedding. In order to acquit himself of this obligation, he was assigned one-tenth of the revenues and produce from the monastery's outlying estates, as well as one-tenth of the offerings and gifts received at the gate.22 22 Cf. I, 335; Verhulst-Semmler, 1962, 265; and III, 105. He was in charge of the collection and transportation of his supplies. At Corbie, for these multiple tasks he was provided with a staff of ten assistants (prouendarii).23 23 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 6, ed. cit., 388, and VerhulstSemmler, loc. cit. Originally, according to Hildemar, the duties of the porter were performed by the monks who were in charge of the abbot's kitchen.24 24 Expositio Hildemari, ed. cit., 605.21. Cf. Hafner, in Studien, 1962, 188. In Hildemar's own days this was no longer possible because of the throng of the guests, which required that two brothers devote themselves exclusively to the task of receiving the poor and announcing distinguished guests to the abbot or prior. While one of the porters attended the divine services or took his meal, the other tended the gate where visitors might arrive at any time.25 25 Expositio Hildemari, ed. cit., 605.26. Monastic protocol required that upon entry kings, bishops, and abbots were received by prostration, the queen by a bend of the knee, others by a nod of the head.26 26 Ibid., 505.6. After the guests had been received and greeted, they were led to prayer; then they were given the kiss of peace, and finally, the abbot presented them with water for their hands, and both the abbot and the community washed the feet of the guests.27 27 Benedicti Regula, chap. 53, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 123-26; McCann, 1952, 118-22; Steidle, 1952, 257-60. On the Plan of St. Gall, as St. Benedict had stipulated, the Porter's dwelling lies near the gate of the abbey, next to the House for Distinguished Guests, and contiguous to the Porch through which the distinguished visitors enter (fig. 395). It consists of a long, narrow apartment that is built against the northern aisle of the Church, forming a counterpart to the Lodging of the Master of the House for Pilgrims and Paupers, but it is twice as large as the latter's dwelling. Internally, it is subdivided into a living room with corner fireplace (caminata portarii) and a dormitory (cubilium eius) with six beds and a projecting privy. One door of the living room opens directly into the northern aisle of the Church, the other onto a long, narrow yard that borders on the yard of the House for Distinguished Guests. 401.A, B, C, D PLAN OF ST. GALL KITCHEN, BAKE AND BREW HOUSE FOR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS. AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION The layout of this structure is a striking example of the extraordinary functional flexibility of the building type to which it historically belongs. The drafters of the Plan found themselves faced with having to enlarge facilities for baking and brewing, installed in the nave of this building, with a large kitchen and larder. They accomplished this by increasing the width of one of the two aisles of the structure (usually about half that of the nave) to a ground area equalling the nave, and by accommodating larder and kitchen in this enlarged aisle to either side of an entrance corridor directly into it. The aisle at the back of the house, used for leavening dough and cooling beer, retained its traditional width. V.8.6 HOUSE FOR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS THE KING'S CLAIM ON MONASTIC HOSPITALITY To the north of the Church in a large enclosure, which forms the counterpart to the court of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers, is a house whose elaborate layout reveals it to be a guesthouse for visitors of unusual stature. It is here that the traveling emperor or king was received, his court or his agents (missi), and also, perhaps, the visiting bishops and abbots. The king's right to draw on the hospitality of the monasteries for food and quarters while traveling dates back to the early days of the introduction of monastic life in transalpine Europe. But the use that the rulers made of it in the time of the Carolingians was considerably more burdensome than it had been under the Merovingians.28 28 Lesne, II, 1922, 287. Ever-changing political necessities, the protection of the boundaries, the maintenance of peace in the interior, prevented the emperor from establishing a permanent residence. "Performing his high craft by constantly shifting around,"29 29 To use a phrase coined by Schulte, 1935, 132. For the ambulatory life of medieval kings in general, see Peyer, 1964. he moved from one of his royal estates to the other—making full use of the obligations of the abbots and bishops to provide him with lodging—according to the circumstances that his itinerary imposed upon him, or simply in response to the necessity of finding additional subsistance for himself and his court. The primary motivations for such visits were not always of an economic or military nature. Gauert's analysis of Charlemagne's itinerary has shown that the emperor's general travel schedule often had embedded in it a special "Gebetsitinerar," at times involving lengthy detours for visits to religious places where the emperor went primarily for the purpose of prayer, to participate in important religious festivals, or to venerate the local saints.30 30 See Gauert, 1965, especially 318ff. The heaviness of the economic obligations that a monastery took upon itself on such occasions depended on the frequency of the visits, the length of the emperor's stay, and the size of his retinue. Charlemagne and Louis the Pious availed themselves of monastic hospitality with discretion; under the later Carolingian kings the burden became heavier.31 31 For more details cf. Lesne's informative chapter on monastic hospitality extended to kings and their representatives, (Lesne, II, 1922, 287ff.) and Voigt's remarks on the increasingly intolerable economic burden royal visits imposed upon the abbeys, bishoprics and counties under the reign of Charles the Bald and Louis the German (Voigt, 1965, 27ff). When Louis the German invaded the empire of the West-Franks in 858, the bishops, in a petition drafted by Hincmar of Reims, beseeched the emperor to bolster his economic capabilities through more efficient management of the crown estates, rather than by depleting the resources of the abbots, bishops and counts for the sustenance of his traveling court. They made a plea that their contribution to the maintenance of the emperor's train be reduced to the share customary during the reign of his father, Louis the Pious. (Epistola synodi Cariasiacensis ad Hludowicum regem Germaniae directa, chap. 14, ed. Krause, Mon. Germ. Hist. Legum Sec. II, Capit. Reg. Franc., II, Hannover, 1897, 437). In a subsequent letter written to Charles the Bald, Hincmar informed the latter that the substance of his petition to Louis the German was, in an even more urgent sense, addressed to him (ibid., 428). But even as early as the second decade of the ninth century the sum of monastic obligations in hospitality had reached proportions so heavy as to drive the witty abbot Theodulf, Bishop of Orléans, to remark desperately that had St. Benedict known how many would come, "he would have locked the doors before them."32 32 Expositio Hildemari, ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 501: "Per Deum, si nunc adesset S. Benedictus, claudere illis ostium fecisset". THEIR MAGNITUDE: A REFLECTION OF THE CLOSE ALLIANCE OF CHURCH AND STATE The Plan of St. Gall provides for four separate houses for the reception of royal visitors: 1, a house for the emperor and his immediate entourage; 2, an ancillary building containing the kitchen, bake, and brewing facilities pertaining to this house; 3, a House for Visiting Servants; and, if my interpretation is correct, 4, a house for the emperor's vassals and others of knightly rank traveling in the emperor's train. Plans, sections, reconstructions, and authors' interpretations for these facilities are shown in figures 396-406. The total surface area taken up by these houses and their surrounding courts amounted to 1,360 square feet, or a little over one-fifth of the surface area of the entire monastery complex. The presence of obligatory royal quarters of such magnitude within the precincts of the monastery is a reflection of the close alliance that had been struck in the kingdom of the Franks between the concepts of regnum and sacerdotium, a development that started with the sanctioning of the Carolingian house by Pope Zacharias in 751 and reached its apex with the coronation of Charlemagne in the year 800. As the appointed successor of the emperors of Rome, Charlemagne had taken upon himself not only the duty of protecting the Church in a physical sense, but also the obligation of safe-guarding its institutions, regulating the life and education of the clergy, and even ruling in questions of liturgy and dogma.33 33 On this aspect of the emperor's responsibilities, see A. Schmidt, 1956, 348; Ganshof, 1960, 96 and Ganshof, 1962, 92. It is fully understandable that within the context of a political philosophy so replete with religious overtones the emperor's presence in the monastery was as yet not considered a worldly infraction on monastic peace and seclusion. THE MAIN HOUSE Layout and function The general purpose of the House for Distinguished Guests is defined by a hexameter which reads: domus Haec quoque hospitibus parta est quoque suspicientis34 34 In writing this line the scribe had started Haec quoque hospitibus . . . , but struck out the word quoque and replaced it by domus, when he discovered that quoque appeared twice in his line. The mistake is interesting, because it shows how strongly the shaper of this hexameter was preoccupied with the content attached to the conjunction quoque. This building, too, serves for the reception of guests The conjunction quoque suggests that the building holds a position of secondary importance with regard to another facility for guests, which can only be the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers. The modest slant of this verse is obviously a reflection of the warning given by St. Benedict that the hospitality accorded to the poor lies on a higher plane of religious devotion than that extended to the rich.35 35 Cf. above p. 139. But the profuse attention lavished on the internal layout of the House for Distinguished Guests tends to defy this thought. The House is 67½ feet long and 55 feet wide. It has as its principal room a large rectangular hall, which its explanatory title defines as the "dining hall of the guests" (domus hospit? ad prandendum). Access to this is gained through a 402. PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR SERVANTS OF OUTLYING ESTATES AND FOR SERVANTS TRAVELING WITH THE EMPEROR'S COURT (NOT CERTAIN: cf. BUILDING 34) The house is one of four identical buildings located to the right of the entrance road where most of the monastery's livestock is kept. Its large central hall, like those of many other buildings of this group, is referred to as DOMUS, a term used by the drafters of the Plan not to designate the entire house (as its classical usage would prescribe), but as a name for the common living room where men gather around the open fireplace for conversation and meals. The spaces in the aisles and under the lean-to's are used for sleeping and for the stabling of livestock. PLAN OF ST. GALL 403.C 403.D EAST ELEVATION AND TRANSVERSE SECTION 403.B LONGITUDINAL SECTION The criteria for reconstructing this house are identical with those which guided that of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers (figs. 393.A-E) and the House for Distinguished Guests (figs. 397.A-F). Being smaller and of more modest purpose, there is no reason to assume that any part of the house was built in masonry, beyond (as sound construction would suggest) its foundation and a shallow plinth of stones protecting the roof-supporting timbers against the dampness of the ground. The traditional building material for this type of house was timber for all its structural members, wattle-and-daub for the walls, and shingles or shakes for the roof. 403.A PLAN HOUSE FOR SERVANTS OF OUTLYING ESTATES AND FOR SERVANTS TRAVELING WITH THE EMPEROR'S COURT AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION 404. PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR KNIGHTS AND VASSALS IN THE EMPEROR'S FOLLOWING Its identification must remain tentative, for the lines and titles of this building were erased in the 12th century by a monk who wrote a Life of St. Martin on the verso of the Plan, spilling the last 22 lines of text onto the plan of this house. The few fragments of titles that escaped his knife were obliterated in the 19th century by an attempt to restore them with a chemical substance that left only coarse blotches on the parchment wherever it was applied. 405. PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR KNIGHTS AND VASSALS IN THE EMPEROR'S FOLLOWING X-rays revealed the outlines of a colossal variant of the standard house of the Plan, with an entrance in one narrow side. Comparison with other similar buildings leaves no doubt that the large center room was intended as a common hall for living and dining, with peripheral spaces serving partly for bedrooms, partly for stables. 406.A PLAN OF ST. GALL HOUSE FOR KNIGHTS AND VASSALS WHO TRAVEL IN THE EMPEROR'S FOLLOWING. AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION "vestibule" (ingressus) which lies in the middle of the southern aisle of the house. The dining hall has in its center a large quadrangular "fireplace" (locus foci) and in the corners, ranged all around the circumference, benches and "tables" (mensae), plus two "cupboards" (toregmata36 36 For the meaning of this term, cf. I, 269. ) for the storage of cups and tableware. Under the lean-to's at each of the narrow ends of the house there are the "bedrooms" for the distinguished guests (caminatae cum lectis), four in all, each furnished with its own corner fireplace and its own projecting privy (necessariü). The rooms to the left and right of the entrance in the southern aisle of the house serve as "quarters for the servants" (cubilia seruitorum), while two corresponding rooms in the northern aisle are used as "stables for the horses" (stabula caballorum). Their cribs (praesepia) are arranged against the outer walls. A small vestibule between the two stables gives access to a covered passage that leads to a large privy (exitus neces- sarius). The latter covers a surface area of 10 by 45 feet and is furnished with no fewer than eighteen toilet seats—an indication of the extraordinary sanitary precautions that, at the time of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious, must have been taken for the persons who traveled in the emperor's immediate entourage.37 37 For a more general analysis of monastic standards of sanitation, see below, pp. 300ff. I have already drawn attention to the fact that the stables for the horses have no direct access from the exterior. The entire house has only one entrance, and in order to reach their stables the horses had to be led through the central dining hall. This suggests that all the rooms of the house were on ground level and that the floor of the center room was made of stamped clay rather than of a boarding of wood. The large open fireplace in the center of the dining room makes it unequivocably clear that this house was not a double-storied structure.38 38 All these features were of primary importance in our analysis of the building type, cf. above, pp. 82ff and 115ff. 406.B By making the center hall of this building 45 feet wide by 60 feet long, the drafters of the Plan pushed the structural capabilities of the aisled Germanic all-purpose house to its limits. Spans of 45 feet, rare even in church construction, were unheard-of in domestic architecture. We know of only one other medieval building of even comparable dimensions: the barn of the abbey grange of Parçay-Meslay, France (figs. 352-355) at a width of 80 feet. But the vast roof of that barn is supported, not by the traditional two, but by four rows of freestanding inner posts. We do not believe that the roof of the House for Knights and Vassals could have been supported successfully by less posting and have therefore introduced in our reconstruction two additional rows of posts, that reduce the center span of the inner hall from 45 to a more conventional 27 feet. Incorporating the doubled rows of posting is not in conflict with methods of architectural rendering employed by the drafters of the Plan. They were not concerned with constructional details, but primarily with establishing the boundaries of each building on the site in terms of its function and its components. The size of a royal retinue—including its servants, grooms, bodyguard, as well as the principals themselves— justifies the tentative identification of this house. In this, as in other buildings of the Plan, details of construction engineering were left to be resolved by the ingenuity of a master builder who would determine in what ways a building conceived for the purpose of housing up to 40 men and 30 horses, and their attendants, could be realized as functional architecture. The interaction of planners with builders is elsewhere attested on the Plan, wherever features obviously intended and needed are absent: staircases, doors and windows, and others (see I. 13, 65ff). The main point of interest, we believe, in our investigation of this particular building is that the prevailing building type of the Plan of St. Gall, the three-aisled hall—without loss of the essence of its character—adapts with ease and dignity and possibly with some elegance, to a building of relatively inordinate size through the device of adding an aisle between the central main space of the nave, and each of the lean-to side aisles. In effect, a five-aisled hall is thus formed (see fig. 354.A, B, Parçay-Meslay, and Les Halles, Côte St. André, Isère, France). Materials and mode of construction In contrast to the Abbot's House,39 39 On the Abbot's House cf. I, 321ff. whose typological roots lie in the South, the House for Distinguished Guests, as has been demonstrated, is a descendant of a strictly Northern building type. It may have been built entirely in wood, or it may have had its circumference walls constructed in masonry. In our reconstructions (figs. 397-399) we have chosen this latter solution in order to demonstrate the possibility of mixed materials on this higher social level of building. In the interior the roof must have been supported by two parallel rows of wooden posts, framed into weight- and thrust-resisting trusses with the aid of tie beams and post plates. If the roof belonged to the purlin family of roofs, its basic design cannot have differed greatly from what we have suggested in figures 397 and 398. For the thirteenth century this type of roof is well attested, at least on the Continent, as has been demonstrated by the examples discussed above on pages 88ff. It may have been as common in Carolingian times. That royal timber houses with masonry walls existed in Carolingian times is known through the Brevium exempla, for it is doubtlessly to this mixture of materials that the author of this work refers, when describing the domus regalis of one of his anonymous crown estates as a house that was "externally built in stone, and inside all in timber" (exterius ex lapide et interius ex ligno bene constructam).40 40 On the Brevium exempla cf. I, 36-44. PLAN OF ST. GALL 406.C NORTH ELEVATION HOUSE FOR KNIGHTS AND VASSALS WHO TRAVEL IN THE EMPEROR'S FOLLOWING Separation of common &amp; private rooms The internal layout of the House for Distinguished Guests (fig. 398) is historically of particular interest, as it shows that at the beginning of the ninth century the timbered royal hall was sufficiently partitioned internally to allow the lord to withdraw from the ranks of his followers to the privacy of separate bedrooms. Dining was still a communal function. But the establishment of individual fireplaces with chimneys in the lord's private chambers made the latter independent from the open fire in the floor of the hall. Architecturally speaking, this means that the private bedrooms under the lean-to's at each end of the hall could have been screened off from the rest of the building, not only by vertical wall partitions (as they most certainly were), but also by their own individual ceilings. If ceilings were installed, the walls required windows, since ceilings would have deprived the bedrooms of the principal source of light for the house—the louver over the fireplace in the ridge of the roof of the hall. The quarters of the servants, on the other hand, cannot have been provided with ceilings, since they depended for warmth on the heat furnished by the communal fire in the center hall. Housing capacity The House for Distinguished Guests can accommodate eight visitors of rank in four separate rooms, each of which is furnished with two beds, two benches, and a corner fireplace.41 41 Stephani's account of the bedding capacity of the private rooms for the distinguished guests is wrong ("Jedes Schlafzimmer sieht sechs Schlafbänke und ein zu wenigstens noch zwei weiteren Personen Raum bietendes Doppelbett vor, will also zumindest acht Personen Aufnahme gewähren"); see Stephani, II, 1903, 32-33. The benches on either side of the corner fireplace are for sitting, not for sleeping. They are too short to be interpreted as beds. These are the rooms for the emperor, the empress, or any other members of the imperial family who accompanied the emperor on his travels, and some of the highest ranking ministers and councilors who were part of the emperor's permanent staff. The rooms for the servants in the southern aisle of the house have a bedding capacity for eighteen men. This is the number of beds of standard size that could be set up for the servants if they were ranged peripherally along the walls of their rooms (nine in each). Eighteen also happens to be the number of toilet seats available in the servant's privy. The two stables in the northern aisle of the house can accommodate four horses 406.D TRANSVERSE SECTION HOUSE FOR KNIGHTS AND VASSALS WHO TRAVEL IN THE EMPEROR'S FOLLOWING each (figuring for each horse a standing area 5 feet wide and 7½ feet long). These must have been the mounts of the distinguished guests, since their number corresponds exactly to the number of beds available in the latter's private chambers. Even the seating capacity of the dining room is closely correlated with the total number of men who can be accommodated in the House for Distinguished Guests. The eastern or upper end of the hall is furnished with two short straight tables, each capable of seating four of the eight distinguished guests (if we attribute to each of them a sitting area 2½ feet wide). The western or lower end has longer, L-shaped tables with sufficient sitting space to take care of the eighteen servants. Number and composition of officers of state in the emperor's train There are no conclusive studies on the number or composition of the officers of state who accompanied the emperor on his travels.42 42 A systematical study of the signatures attached to imperial deeds, issued as the emperor moved from place to place, may help to clarify this problem. From Hincmar's account of Adalhard of Corbie's De Ordine Imperii,43 43 Cf. Metz, 1960, 11-18; and Hincmarus De Ordine Palatii, chap. 23, ed. Krause, 1894, 18. it appears that the central administrative body of the Carolingian court consisted of a staff of six leading functionaries, who by the very definition of their office were part and parcel of the emperor's personal entourage, viz., the Seneschal (senescalcus, literally, "the old servant") who was in charge of provisions and especially those of the royal table; the Butler (buticularius), 406.E PLAN OF ST. GALL EAST ELEVATION HOUSE FOR KNIGHTS AND VASSALS WHO TRAVEL IN THE EMPEROR'S FOLLOWING responsible for drink; the Chamberlain (camerarius) in charge of lodging and the royal treasury; the Constable (comes stabuli) in charge of horses and all other means of transportation; the Count Palatine (comes palatinus), the primary officer in charge of the empire's judiciary administration; and last but not least, the Arch Chaplain (summus capellanus), the emperor's primary advisor in ecclesiastical and educational matters, whose office later became absorbed in that of the Chancellor (summus sacri palatii cancellarius).44 44 Cf. Ganshof's remarks on the "aulic" nature of this staff of officers and their respective duties, Ganshof, 1958, 47-48; 1962, 99-100; 1965, 361ff. On the ambivalence of the offices of the summus capellanus and summus cancellarius, see Klewitz, 1937, 52-55. Readiness for action involving the state and the imperial household in its entirety would have required the presence of all these men. But it is well known that the holders of these offices were often away from the court in the summer on special missions.45 45 For a recent study on the court of Charlemagne and its fluctuating composition, see Fleckenstein, 1965. The House for Distinguished Guests, nevertheless, would have been equipped to accommodate all these men besides the emperor himself, plus his wife or one of his children. How many members of his family he was wont to have with him when traveling is another question for which we have no ready answer. "Charlemagne," we are told by Einhard, "cared so deeply for the training of his children that he never took his meal without them when he was at home, and never made a journey without them."46 46 Einhard's Life of Charlemagne, ed. Garrod and Mowat, 1915, 23-25; Éginhard, Vie de Charlemagne, ed. Halphen, 1923, 60-61; The Life of Charlemagne by Einhard, ed. Painter, 1960, 48. The phrase is fashioned after a passage in Suetonius' Life of the Emperor Augustus. Although this could scarcely have applied to all the seven sons and daughters47 47 On this point see Halphen, loc. cit., and idem, 1921, 95. that Einhard ascribes to Charlemagne, it would still suggest that the traveling emperor was frequently accompanied by one or another of his sons and daughters.48 48 On the veracity of Einhard's testimony even where it is couched in literary imagery borrowed from Suetonius, see Beumann, 1951, 1962; and Fleckenstein, 1965, 24ff. When Louis the Pious stayed in St. Gall in 857, his sons Karlmann and Karl III were with him.49 49 Notkeri Gesta Karoli, Book I, chap. 34, ed. Rau, in Quellen zur Karolingischen Reichsgeschichte, III, 1960, 374-75. This is about all that seems to be known on this subject. The Plan of St. Gall may actually help us here to close a gap of knowledge. It discloses that at the time of Louis the Pious a monastery was expected to be capable of taking care of a royal party consisting of eight dignitaries of state or members of the imperial family, their mounts, and eighteen of their personal servants. In later centuries the figure may have been considerably larger. The Consuetudinary of Farfa—in reality the customs of Cluny (written between 1030 and 1048)—prescribed for that monastery a guest house for forty male and thirty female members of the emperor's train, plus a stable capable of sheltering some 150 horses.50 50 Consuetudines Farfenses, Book II, chap. 1, ed. Albers, in Cons. Mon., I, 1900, 138. Cf. below, pp. 277, 306. The stable for the horses was 280 feet long and 25 feet wide. Counting a standing area of 5 by 7½ feet per horse, this house would shelter 152 horses stabled in opposite rows along the two long walls of the structure. From this figure, of course, one would have to subtract a certain number, as some of the space in the walls must have been taken up by entrances. The second story of this stable house contained the eating and sleeping quarters of the riding members of the emperor's train, who could not be accommodated in the house of the noblemen and their ladies. In addition to the mounted following there was also a train of unmounted men. Yet conditions at Cluny were probably unusual. A fulcrum of revival and reform among the monasteries of France and unbelievably rich, the abbey was already well on its way toward wedging itself as an arbitrating spiritual force into the interplay between the secular and the ecclesiastical powers of the period. Other supporting forces Even in the ninth century, nevertheless, a guest house with a bedding capacity of eight distinguished guests, their horses, and eighteen of their servants, is not likely to have been capable of accommodating the whole of the emperor's permanent train. To be protected, the king needed a bodyguard. Such a guard of mounted knights would not necessarily have had to be very large, yet it is unlikely to have consisted of fewer than twenty or thirty men. They, too, and their horses would have to be provided with quarters. One would have to expect, additionally, a small train of wagons with emergency rations, kitchens, tents, and other equipment indispensable to the movement of the court. This involved another troup of servants who would also have to be sheltered. The Plan of St. Gall shows two buildings that may have performed that function, located at the gate of the monastery in the immediate vicinity of the House for Distinguished Guests. But before we turn to them, some attention must be paid to the kitchen, bake, and brewing facilities of the House for Distinguished Guests. KITCHEN, BAKE AND BREW HOUSE FOR THE DISTINGUISHED GUESTS The main portion of this structure, which covers an area roughly 50 by 55 feet (figs. 396, 400-401), is identical with that of the Bake and Brew House for Pilgrims and Paupers (fig. 392). But its outside appearance must have been quite different, as it had attached to it on the side facing the House for Distinguished Guests, two large rectangular rooms (17½ feet by 22½ feet); one of which served as the guests' kitchen (culina hospit?), the other as "larder" (promptuari?). The kitchen stove, a square of 5 by 5 feet, is subdivided into four cooking areas by two median lines that bisect it at right angles. The principal space of the house, measuring 20 by 55 feet, contains in its southern half the "bakery" (pistrinum) with its "oven" (fornax), two kneading troughs (not designated as such by inscriptions), and all around the periphery of the room, the indispensable tables for the shaping and laying out of the loaves. The northern half contains the brew house (domus conficiendae celiae) with fires and coppers for malting the grain (fig. 401A). The aisle in the rear of the house is subdivided into two equal parts, each serving as an accessory to the work carried on in the corresponding portion of the principal space of the house. The room near the bakery is designated as "the place where dough is made [by mingling flour with water]" (interndae pastae locus) and for that purpose it is furnished with a long trough and a circular vat. The other near the brewery, is described as the place where the brew is "cooled" (hic refrigeratur ceruisa). It is equipped with two smaller troughs that stand on either side of a circular vat. V.8.7 HOUSE FOR SERVANTS OF OUTLYING ESTATES &amp; SERVANTS TRAVELING WITH THE EMPEROR'S COURT This house measures 47½ feet by 60 feet (figs. 402-403) and lies to the right of the entrance road in a tract entirely reserved for the raising of livestock; and it is the only one among the buildings in this sector which is inhabited by people alone. Its general purpose is described in a hexameter which reads: Hic requiem inueniat famulantum turba uicissim Here, from time to time, let the throng of the servants find rest Its layout is a classical example of what in an earlier phase of this study we referred to as the "standard house" of the Plan of St. Gall; a house consisting of a central hall with open fireplace and aisles and lean-to's all around the hall. The entrance, like those of all the other houses in this tract, lies in the middle of the eastern long wall. Two rooms on either side of the entrance serve as quarters for the guardians (cubi&amp;#x0288; custodienti?). The great hall in the center carries the inscription, "the hall of the serfs who come with the service" (dom&amp;#x0186; famuliae quae cum seruitio aduenerit). Keller, Willis, Bikel, Leclercq, and Reinhardt51 51 Keller, 1844, 33-34; Willis, 1848, 115; Bikel, 1914, 221; Reinhardt, 1952, 16. interpreted this to refer to the serfs who live on outlying estates (familia foris) and come to the monastery in the pursuit of their obligatory services, delivery of produce, tithe, or harvest; Bischoff thinks that the house was for the accommodation of servants who traveled in the following of a visiting ruler.52 52 Bischoff, in Studien, 1962, 72. Both views may be correct, since the seruitium mentioned in the explanatory title may refer to either or both: the service due the king or the service due the monastery.53 53 With regard to servitium regis, cf. Heusinger, 1923. On the familia foris and the monastery's relation to outlying estates, see I, 341. The monastery needed lodgings for the serfs who came with deliveries from places too distant to allow them to return to their base on the same day. It also needed lodgings for the servants who traveled in the king's train. As both of these potential occupants arrived only intermittently (uicissim, "as the case may be"), the house may have performed the double task of giving shelter to both. V.8.8 HOUSE FOR KNIGHTS AND VASSALS WHO TRAVEL IN THE EMPEROR'S FOLLOWING ERASURE OF OUTLINES AND DESTRUCTION OF EXPLANATORY TITLE The large anonymous building in the northwestern corner of the monastery remains enigmatic. Its lines and all its explanatory titles were erased in the twelfth century by the monk who wrote the Life of St. Martin on the back of the Plan and spilled his text over onto the front side of the Plan (fig. 404).54 54 Cf. I, xxii, and 1. During the nineteenth century an attempt was made to make the inscription legible with the aid of a chemical substance, which destroyed it forever.55 55 This was doubtlessly done by the same hand that tampered with the titles of the trees in the Monks' Cemetery, fortunately with less destructive effects. See below, p. 210, fig. 430. The chemicals left strong blue blotches whose distribution reveals that the house was originally provided with a long title (unquestionably in metric form), running parallel to the entrance side of the house, which is east; a shorter title explaining the function of the large hall in the center; and other short titles designating the purpose of the rooms in the aisles and lean-to's. X-ray photographs taken in 1949 by the Schweizerische Landesmuseum at Zurich brought to light the outlines of the building itself (fig. 405), but failed to reveal its titles. Ildefons von Arx, in two hand-drawn annotated copies of the Plan, made around 1827, remarks, "Von dem Hause sind bloss geringe Spuren übrig und die angeschriebenen Erklärungen und Bestimmungen vertilgt. . . . Es scheint aber ebenfalls eine Stallung (vielleicht für Gastpferde) gewesen zu sein."56 56 Cf. Duft, in Studien, 1962, 35-36. Keller apparently could still read the word cubilia.57 57 Keller, 1844, 36. PRESUMPTIVE PURPOSE I have expressed the view in previous studies that this building might have been a large barn or wagon shed,58 58 Horn, 1962, 110 note 15; and idem, 1958, 8, caption to fig. 16. but I am now inclined to think that it served as quarters for the emperor's bodyguard. The assumption of a wagon shed is precluded by the fact—not recognizable to the naked eye but clearly exposed by the X-rays (fig. 405)—that the only entrance that gives access to the building is not wide enough to admit any wagons. Unfortunately, we are not well informed about the size and composition of the emperor's bodyguard when he was engaged in travel. In the previously quoted passage from the Life of Charlemagne, where Einhard tells that the emperor liked to take his sons and daughters along on his journeys, Einhard remarks that on such occasions "his sons would ride at his side and his daughters follow him, while a number of his bodyguards, detailed for their protection, brought up the rear."59 59 See above, note 46. A hint of the total number involved in such movements might be contained in a passage of the Chronicle of Hariulf, where it is said that the abbot and priors of St.-Riquier, when traveling, enjoyed the protection of the monastery's entire retinue of 110 mounted knights. As the chronicler proudly adds in this context, when the knights were gathered at St.-Riquier during the religious festivals, "their presence lent to the monastery almost the appearance of a royal court,"60 60 Hariulf, Chronique de l'Abbaye de Saint-Riquier, ed. Lot, 1894, cf. I, 347. An interesting sidelight on this question is the tabulation which Meyer von Knonau made in a study of 1872 on the officiales of the monastery of St. Gall with the aid of the archival resources of this abbey published by Wartmann. He could establish with certainty that Abbot Gozbert (816-836) traveled at least on eight different occasions with his advocatus and five to six further officials, Abbot Bernwick (837-840) twice with eight officials, and Abbot Grimald (841-872) on occasion with as many as seven, nine and ten. This information is gleaned from the signatures attached to deeds which were written in the course of such travels. The signatures are, of course, confined to those officials only who by position or rank were qualified to serve as formal witnesses. The deeds remain silent on the number of servants or knights who were part of these movements. Ratperti casus s. Galli, ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1872, Excurs L, 83ff. we must infer that the emperor himself was wont to turn up with an even larger escort when visiting the abbey. Heusinger estimates the traveling emperor's court to have run into the hundreds.61 61 Heusinger, 1923, 62. Professor Ganshof would consider this to be an excessive figure if it were applied to the Carolingian period.62 62 Oral communication. I should like to draw attention, in this context, to an agreement struck in 1056 between the Abbey of Moutier-en-Der and the Count of Brienne, according to which the abbey was required to take care of the count, and ten to fifteen knights of his train, when the count passed through the country: "et si aliquo modo forte ei contigerit ut per regionem transeat cum decem aut quindecim militibus, ministerialis Sancti Petri victum ei prebebit;" see Guerard, II, 1844, Appendix XX, 361. In later centuries the traveling train of feudal magnates attained considerably larger proportions. Sir Thomas of Berkeley II (12811321) is said to have had a household and a "standing domestic family" of more than two hundred persons, knights, esquires, serving men and pages; and Godfrey Giffard, Bishop of Worcester between 1266 and 1302, is reputed to have had a hundred horses in his traveling court. (I am gleaning this information from Hilton, 1966, 25; for sources see ibid., 272, notes 1 and 2). Obviously, the number of men who made up such a protective guard must have varied greatly, depending on the political stability at the time of travel and the distance involved in the journey,63 63 When Charlemagne summoned the young King Louis of Aquitaine to Paderborn during the Saxon war of 808-809, the latter joined him, according to a good contemporary source "with his entire military strength" (cum populo omni militari); and four years later, when Louis traveled to Aachen, upon the news of his father's death, according to the same source, "he entered upon his journey with as many people as the perplexity of the time allowed" (cum quanto passa est angustia temporis populo), "for it was feared that Wala, possessor of the highest rank with Charles, might plot something underhanded against the emperor" (Anonymi Vita Hludowici, chap. 4, ed. Rau, I, 1956, 264-65 and chap. 21, ibid., 290-91; cf. also Son of Charlemagne, A Contemporary Life of Louis the Pious, ed. Allen Cabanis, 1961, 35 and 54. but one might safely expect that an elite guard of some twenty to thirty men accompanied the emperor wherever he went. The great anonymous building at the northwestern corner of the monastery site could easily have accommodated a detachment of this magnitude, and if necessity demanded, a detachment several times larger. The natural monastic traffic flow would call for such a barracks to be located in that corner rather than anywhere else in the rectangular site into which the monastery is inscribed. One wonders whether von Arx's conjecture that the house might have been used for "guest horses," was pure fantasy or whether his eye could still decipher somewhere among the obliterated titles the word caballi. DIMENSIONS AND HOUSING CAPACITY The building is 100 feet long and 80 feet wide. Its great common hall covers a surface area of 65 feet by 45 feet. It contains in its center a hearth or cooking area 17½ feet long and 15 feet wide. The lean-to's of the hall, if used as stables, could accommodate fourteen horses under the eastern hip of the roof and sixteen horses under the western hip (counting per horse a standing area 5 feet wide and 7½ feet long). Each of the four large rooms in the aisles have a bedding capacity for ten to twelve men (if the beds were ranged in standard fashion around the four walls of the room). Total occupancy: thirty horses and forty to forty-four men. If utilized in barrack fashion—and especially, if the large common hall in the center was also used for stabling and bedding—the housing capacity of the building could be tripled. CONSTRUCTIONAL IMPLICATIONS The reconstruction of this colossal structure poses problems as difficult as the bewildering riddle of its purpose. Its great central hall (measuring 45 feet by 60 feet) is 5 feet wider than the nave of the Church of the Plan of St. Gall. It is technically possible to span such a distance with tie beams of very heavy scantling—the abbey church of Fulda had a nave width of well over 50 feet (16.70 m.)—but the fact remains that an aisled hall with an open center space of 45 feet is not known to have existed in the earlier Middle Ages at any place, with the solitary exception of the Great Hall of the Palace of Westminster (1097-99) which owed its inordinate dimensions to a very unusual set of historical circumstances.64 64 For Westminster Hall, see Horn, 1958, 10 and idem, 1965, 67-78. Even in the largest monastic barns of the thirteenth century the center aisle rarely exceeds a span of 30 feet, and, in general, stays below the range of 20 feet.65 65 For a good comparative sampling of plans and sections of large medieval barns of this construction type, see Horn, 1965, figs. 57A-F. Where barns attained a width that was in any manner comparable to the building with which we are here concerned, their roofs were supported not by two but by four ranges of freestanding inner posts, as in the great monastic barn of Parçay-Meslay in France (figs. 352-354).66 66 See Horn, 1958, 12ff. In order to bring our building a little closer to both constructional realities as well as to what appears convincing in the light of existing historical parallels, we have introduced in our reconstruction two inner rows of roof-supporting posts along lines which have no equivalent on the Plan itself. This is not quite as arbitrary as it may appear on first sight. The inventor of the scheme of the Plan, as I have already pointed out,67 67 Cf. above, p. 162, fig. 406.C (caption). was not preoccupied with the definition of the constructional details of his houses—these were fixed by tradition, and therefore not in need of further specification. Instead he chose to give his full attention to defining the size and functional boundaries of its component spaces. We shall meet this same problem again when discussing the Granary, the House for Bloodletting, and the hall in the House for Horses and Oxen.68 68 On the Granary, see below, pp. 215ff; on the House for Bloodletting, below, pp. 184ff; on the House for Horses and Oxen, below, pp. 271ff. The colossal dimensions of the large anonymous building may elicit the thought that the designing architect was not aware of the unusual dimensional and constructional implications of what he drew. If this were so, it would be in complete departure from the procedures that he followed everywhere else in the Plan. Wherever the relation of size to function can be checked, it is apparent that at every step of his work the draftsman operated in full awareness of the dimensional realities involved. Accordingly, if he drew a house 80 feet wide and 100 feet long, we must assume he did so because he felt that there was a need for a house of such dimensions. V. 9 OUTER SCHOOL &amp; THE LODGING OF THE SCHOOLMASTER V.9.1 THE MONASTERY'S EDUCATIONAL TASKS ROYAL DIRECTIVES Be it known, therefore, to your devotion pleasing to God, that we, together with our faithful, have considered it to be useful that the bishoprics and monasteries entrusted by the favor of Christ to our control, in addition to the order of monastic life and the intercourse of holy religion, in the culture of letters also ought to be zealous in teaching those who by the gift of God are able to learn, according to the capacity of each individual, so that just as the observance of the rule imparts order and grace to honesty of morals, so also zeal in teaching and learning may do the same for sentences, so that those who desire to please God by living rightly should not neglect Him also by speaking correctly.1 1 After Munro, 1900, 12-14. Thus wrote Charlemagne to Abbot Baugulf of Fulda in a letter drafted by Alcuin, probably in 784 or 785. In a second issue of the same letter, made out to Archbishop Angilram of Metz, the emperor adds the admonition: Do not neglect, therefore, if you wish to have our favor, to send copies of this letter to all your suffragans and fellow bishops and to all the monasteries. The letter from which these sentences are quoted, Charlemagne's famous epistola de litteris collendis,2 2 For the original text see Capitulare de litteris collendis, in Mon. Germ. Hist., Legum II, Capit. I, ed. Boretius, 1883, 78-79. A better edition is the recent one of Stengel, 1958, 246-54, with important comments on the authorship of Alcuin and on the date of the letter. To the authorship question, cf. also Wallach, 1951. is one of the first of a series of royal directives assigning to the episcopal and monastic schools of the Frankish kingdom an active role in education. It is one of the cornerstones of that programmatic revival of both theological and classical studies in which Charles took an intense personal interest and which ushered in the Carolingian Renascence. One of Charles's specific concerns was the intellectual formation of the youth who were to form the core of the coming generation of priests and clerics. In a great circular directive of 789, the admonitio generalis,3 3 Admonitio generalis, ed. Boretius, op. cit., 52-62. he ruled that the children of free laymen be admitted to the monastic schools, and that reading classes be established for the young (scolae legentium puerorum) in which the psalms, music, chant, the calendar of the religious festivals, grammar, and the creeds of the faith be taught.4 4 Cf. I, p. 24. On the total collapse of the Early Christian episcopal school system during the havoc caused by the Germanic migrations, and the foundation of new schools of learning in the monasteries of Merovingian and Hiberno-Saxon Europe see Charles W. Jones in his preface to Bede's Didactic Works (Bedae Opera Didascalica, ed. Jones in Corpus Christianorum, CXXXIII:B, 1970, and "Bede's Place in Medieval Schools," Jones, 1973. There also the reader will find an analysis of the early monastic curriculum and Bede's shares in forming a paradigmatic program of monastic studies as the composer of what became traditional Carolingian textbooks. In the pursuit of these as well as the more general aims of his educational reform, the emperor systematically enlarged the body of his personal entourage by adding to the old nucleus of administrative officers of the Palace distinguished scholars from England, Ireland, Italy, and Spain, thus setting up at the court itself a school of learning that could be used as a model for the other schools in his realm.5 5 On the systematic nature of this attempt, besides the general literature quoted in I, 25 note 45, see commentary of Fleckenstein, 1965, 36ff. The close relationship that existed between so many medieval rulers and their leading bishops and abbots was due in no small measure to friendships struck up between these rulers and their former fellow students and teachers during their education in monastic schools.6 6 Of members of the royal family educated in monastic schools Mabillon cites Lothar, the son of Charles the Bald (monastery of St.Germain at Auxerre); Theoderic III (monastery of Chelles); Louis IV; Pepin (the father of Charlemagne); and Robert II (monastery of St.-Denis). Some monasteries were understandably proud of these connections, as may be gathered from a boastful passage in Hariulf's Chronicle of St.-Riquier: And as we are speaking of noblemen, never did anyone seek for anything more distinguished, if he had knowledge of the nobility of the monks of St.-Riquier: for in this monastery were educated dukes, counts, the sons of dukes, and even the sons of kings. Every higher dignitary, wherever located in the kingdom of the Franks, boasted of having a relative in the abbey of St.-Riquier.7 7 Hariulf, ed. Lot, 1894, 118-19: "Nec enim unquam aliquis de nobilibus loquens aliud nobilius quaesivit, si sancti Richarii monachorum nobilitas ei nuntiata fuit. In hoc enim coenobio duces, comites, filii ducum, filii etiam regum educabantur. Omnis sublimior dignitas, quaquaversum per regnum Francorum posita, in Sancti Richarii monasterio se parentem habere gaudebat." STRESSES LEADING TO DIVISION INTO INNER AND OUTER SCHOOLS The stresses that these new educational obligations imposed upon monastic seclusion were great and must have been in debate at the second synod of Aachen which passed the perplexing resolution, "There shall be no other school in the monastery than that which is used for the instruction of the future monks."8 8 Cf. I, 24. I have already had occasion to point out that it could not have been the intent of this ruling to relieve the monasteries entirely from their share in the intellectual training of the secular youth, which would have been a complete reversal of the educational policies promoted by Charlemagne. Rather it was the expression of a conflict which in practice was settled by the division of the monastic educational system into an "inner" and an "outer" school, the former for the training of the future monks, the latter for the instruction of those who planned to enter upon the career of the secular clergy and of such laymen, poor or noble, whose education was entrusted to monastic teachers. The former was located in the cloister; the latter outside it, at a place where it would not intrude on monastic privacy. This is precisely the manner in which this problem was settled on the Plan of St. Gall. The inner school is in the cloister of the Novices,9 9 Ibid. Concerning the responsibilities and differences between the scholae exteriores and the scholae interiores, see Jean Mabillon, Acta, III:1, 1939, xxxiv-xxv. The history of the School of the monastery of St. Gall and its teachers has been dealt with in a special study by P. Gabriel Meier, published in 1885. Also to be consulted in this context is De Rijk's account of the curriculum and the still existing text books of the schools of the monastery of St. Gall, published in 1963. the Outer School lies between the House for Distinguished Guests and the Abbot's House, i.e., in a tract which in all other respects held a transitional position between the monastic and secular world. Unlike the schola interior, which remained essentially confined to elementary learning, the schola exterior developed quickly into a school for advanced study.10 10 This aspect is stressed by Leclercq in Cabrol-Leclercq, VI:1, 1924, col. 100. 407. PLAN OF ST. GALL. THE OUTER SCHOOL The simple map reveals with almost startling clarity the centrality of the site of St. Gall in the Frankish Empire. The dicta of Charlemagne regarding education of clerics and children of free laymen were embodied on the Plan in the Outer School, where it was intended the Empire's most outstanding teachers should profess and the nation's intellectual leaders be trained. Provided with bedroom cubicles, two classrooms, and an annexed privy, the Outer School lacks a kitchen; perhaps students dined in the House for Distinguished Guests when it was unoccupied, or perhaps took a meal in the Monks' Refectory, seated at the lower end of the hall. 408.A PLAN OF ST. GALL. OUTER SCHOOL. PLAN. AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION Cubicles in the aisles and lean-to's of this building reflect more clearly than the room divisions in other guest and service structures the bay division of the aisled Germanic all-purpose house, from which these buildings of the Plan historically derive. Explanatory titles identify the cubicles of the Outer School as students' bedrooms, and the large central common hall as the area for teaching and study. This hall is divided into two classrooms by a freestanding median wall partition. Each is furnished with its own fireplace, and above these in the roof ridge are lanterns (TESTU) serving as smoke escape and to admit light and air. The small squares in the students' cubicles are unexplained. It is tempting to interpret them as study tables; but similar squares in the two divisions of the central hall suggest that there should be openings in the roof to admit light. We have thus reconstructed them in this sense, as dormer windows. DISTINGUISHED TEACHERS In the ninth and tenth centuries in the monastery of St. Gall, these schools produced some of the greatest teachers of the period, the lives and works of whom Ekkehart IV describes in his Casus sancti Galli with as much detail and color as those of the greatest abbots.11 11 See the chapters on Iso, Marcellus, Radpert, Notker, Tutilo, and the various Ekkehart's in Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877. The accounts are scattered, but can be easily identified through the index of persons in Helbling's translation of 1958. Cf. Bruckner, 1938, 28-29. On the unbroken monastic tradition, master to disciple, from the sixth to the twelfth century, see Charles W. Jones, in Bedae Opera Didascalia, ed. cit., 7ff: "Theodore, trained among the Greeks, and his companion Hadrian, trained in Africa, were led to England by Benedict Biscop, who was trained at Honoratus' and Cassian's Lerins. Benedict founded Bede's abbey and trained Ceolfrid, who trained Bede. The subsequent chain, through Egbert, Albert, Alcuin, Raban, Lupus, Heiric Remigius, leads to Gerbert, Fulbert, and Berengar." From Ekkehart's account we also learn that the Outer School of the monastery of St. Gall lay to the north of the Church, at almost the same location it occupies on the Plan of St. Gall; for in his description of the fire of 937 Ekkehart relates how the dry shingles of the burning roof of the school were blown by the north wind onto the church tower and ignited its roof.12 12 Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, chap. 67; ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 240-43; ed. Helbling, 1958, 127-28. Cf. below, p. 329. PLAN OF ST. GALL. OUTER SCHOOL. LONGITUDINAL SECTION, NORTH ELEVATION 408.B 408.C 408.D PLAN OF ST. GALL. OUTER SCHOOL. SOUTH ELEVATION The Outer School could have been built entirely in timber (as was traditional for this type of building) or—because of the high social standing of many of its occupants, its proximity to the Abbot's House, as well as its need for ample lighting—in the mixed technique which we propose for the House for Distinguished Guests (figs. 397-399). Masonry would have had the additional advantage of permitting fenestration in the outer walls of the building. Adding to this 24-student potential capacity the 12 oblates and novices trained in the Inner School, the 36-student capacity provided for by facilities on the Plan of St. Gall proves far fewer than the total of 100 students that was Angilbert's pride at St. Riquier ("centum pueros in hoc sancto loco in scolam congregare studuimus"; Angilberti Abbatis de ecclesia Centulensi Libellus, G. Waitz, ed., Mon. Germ. hist., Scriptores, XV:1, Hannover 1887, 173-79). V.9.2 THE OUTER SCHOOL LAYOUT &amp; MEANING OF EXPLANATORY TITLES The Outer School of the Plan (fig. 407) is surrounded by a fence which is designated with the hexameter: Haec quoq. septa premunt, discentis uota iuuentae These fences enclose the endeavor of the learning youth Measuring 70 feet in length and 55 feet in width, its surface area exceeds that of the House for the Distinguished Guests by a slight margin. The building consists of a large rectangular hall, inscribed with the title domus communis scolae id÷ uacationis. The interpretation of this title is controversial. Keller, Willis, Campion, Leclercq, and Reinhardt transcribed the abbreviation id÷ wrongly as idem and interpreted the term uacatio as "recreation," thus translating the line as "the common-room of the school and place for recreation."13 13 Keller, 1844, 25; Willis, 1848, 105; Campion, 1868, 391; Leclercq, 1924, col. 100; and Reinhardt, 1952, 13. Meier transcribed id÷ correctly as id est14 14 Meier, 1885, 40. With regard to the interpretation of the symbol id÷ as id est, see Cappelli, Lexicon, 1954, xxxiii, and 168; and Battelli, 1949, 114. and proposed uacatio is simply a Latinization of the Greek word ?????, which came into use in the Latin world in republican times as the designation for higher studies in literature, grammar and rhetoric.15 15 Cf. Paré, Brunet, and Tremblay, 1933, 59, n. 3. He interprets the title accordingly as "the common hall for the school, i.e. the place of study." The term uacatio is not used in the Rule of St. Benedict, but to judge by the frequency with which it appears in Hildemar's commentary to the Rule (written around 845) it must have been fashionable in the Carolingian period. Hildemar employs it no fewer than fifteen PLAN OF ST. GALL. OUTER SCHOOL. TRANSVERSE SECTION, EAST ELEVATION 408.E 408.F As with most other buildings of its type, the Outer School has one entrance; access to all its peripheral rooms including the privy can be gained only through the central hall. The privy has 15 seats. Comparing the ratio of seats available per number of occupants in other buildings of this class would suggest that each student cubicle was occupied by two persons. PLAN OF ST. GALL. LODGING OF THE MASTER OF THE OUTER SCHOOL 409. 409.X The layout of the Schoolmaster's Lodging is almost the same as the Porter's, like the latter consisting of living room, bedroom, and provided with corner fireplace and private toilet. The bedroom shows the Schoolmaster's bed and two others along the inner wall, suggesting that the Outer School may have been staffed by three teachers. From the living room a door afforded access to the Church (the parchment is damaged here) where students and teachers spent some part of each day. The traffic patterns (fig. 409.X) suggest routes between the Lodging, the Church, and the Outer School; fences separated the students from the guests lodged to the west and assured the Abbot's privacy to the east. times in a single chapter16 16 In his commentary on chapter 48 of the Rule of St. Benedict ("Of the Daily Manual Labor"). See Expositio Hildemari, ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 476-89. and in one of these places pauses to furnish his readers with a regular dictionary definition: "vacare means to relinquish one thing and to replace it with some other preoccupation; it is in this sense that he [St. Benedict] insists, in this chapter that, manual work being set aside, the time thus released be used for study" (`Vacare' est enim aliam rem relinquere et aliis insistere rebus, sicuti in hoc loco relicta exercitatione manuum jubet insistere lectioni).17 17 Hildemar, op. cit., 480. In accordance with this definition I would translate the title domus communis scolae, id ÷ uacationis as "the common hall for learning, i.e., for the time relinquished from other obligations for the purpose of study."18 18 If "other obligations," however, should refer, not to manual labor, but to the commitments of the monks who lived in the cloister as distinguished from those of the secular clerks, who resided in the Outer School, the title domus communis scolae, id ÷ uacationis might be translated as "the common hall for study by those who are not committed to monastic life"—a possibility brought to my attention by Charles W. Jones. The secular meaning of the term uacatio, unquestionably is "leisure" or "detention," in the sense of freedom from the vulgar chores of providing a living through manual labor. In this sense uacatio, like its Greek equivalent ?????, is "the intellectual cultivation of the mind made possible through the availability of leisure." The hall measures 30 feet by 40 feet and is divided in half crosswise by a median wall. This partition does not run clear across the room but has wide passages at either end, suggesting that it was a low freestanding screen rather than a massive wall and that the large hall, although each of the two partitions is provided with its own fireplace and louver (testu), was conceived of as a single space rather than as two separate rooms. The fact that the inscription that defines the purpose of this space runs across the wall partition corroborates this interpretation. Ranged peripherally around this center space are twelve "small dwelling rooms for the students" (mansiunculae scolasticorum hic),19 19 Mansiunculae scolasticorum was wrongly interpreted by Keller, 1844, 25, as "die Wohnstübchen der Lehrer." The mistake was inherited by Stephani, II, 1903, 29; Reinhardt, 1952, 25; and Hafner, in Studien, 962, 184. Willis, 1848, 105, and Leclercq, 1924, col. 100, translated scolastici correctly as "students." For reference to ninth-century sources using the term in this manner, see Meier, 1884, 40, note 2. The term is later also used for "teachers" (cf. Paré, Brunet, and Tremblay, 1933, 69ff.), but its interpretation on the Plan of St. Gall is clarified by the fact that the Plan provides special quarters for the Master of the School. Furthermore, one must ask, where in the Outer School would the students sleep, if not in the "little dwellings" in the aisles and under the lean-to's. and in the area between them in the middle of the southern long wall a slightly smaller space which served as "entrance" (introitus). On the opposite side a room of like dimensions served as "exit to the outhouse" (necessarius exitus). The rooms of the students each measure 12½ feet by 15 feet. They have in the center a small square, which Keller and Willis interpreted as a table.20 20 Keller, 1844, 25; and Willis, 1848, 105. I am rather inclined to think that these squares are the designation for dormer windows in the lower slope of the roof, of the type shown in the February representation of the Grimani Breviary (fig. 367). The two louvers over the center space of the house, although providing adequate lighting for the two classrooms directly beneath them, would not have furnished sufficient light for the pursuit of individual studies in the student cubicles located in the aisles and lean-to's. Additional light could, of course, also have been provided by windows in the outer walls of the house, and with special ease, if the latter were built in masonry. In our reconstruction (figs. 408A-E) we have demonstrated both these possibilities, introducing a volume of light that is probably in excess of what one would reasonably expect to have been available in the ninth century. Under no circumstances should the squares in the students' rooms be interpreted as fireplaces. Open fires in each of these twelve cubicles would have constituted a fire hazard of the first degree and would have been without parallel in any known or excavated example of this construction type. Moreover, although many of the students who occupied these rooms may well have been of noble birth, their status as students was scarcely of sufficient weight to entitle them to a privilege otherwise accorded only to the highest ranking dignitaries of the monastic community.21 21 Cf. above, p. 124. All of the students' rooms are accessible from the main hall. The doors are so arranged as to serve as entrance not for one, but for two cubicles. The existence of these doors and their carefully planned location leaves no doubt that the students' rooms were separated from the main hall by partitions. These partitions, however, could not have run up to the roof of the house, as the cubicles depended for their warmth on the open fires that burned in the main hall, and this, in turn, presupposes a free exchange of air between the main hall and the students' rooms. NUMBER OF STUDENTS The Plan gives no clues as to the number of students to be housed in these rooms. Each mansiuncula might have been reserved for a single student. But it could easily have accommodated two; with less comfort, three. The total number of students, accordingly, would either have been twelve, twenty-four, or thirty-six. Since the privy of the Outer School has fifteen toilet seats, the normal number of students is likely to have exceeded the minimum number of twelve. We have already discussed at sufficient length the fact that the Plan does not tell us where the students ate their meals and where their food was cooked. V.9.3 THE SCHOOLMASTER'S LODGING The Master of the Outer School was not accommodated in the school building itself, but in a special lodging built against the northern aisle of the Church, immediately adjacent to the school. It consists of two rooms, a "living room" (mansio scolae) furnished with a corner fireplace, a bench, and a table,22 22 In the past literature this was consistently interpreted as mansio capitis scolae. This may be a correct interpolation, but the word capitis is not visible. See Keller, 1844, 25; Willis, 1848, 106; Leclercq, 1924, col. 100. and a "withdrawing" room (ejusd? secret?), furnished with three beds (fig. 409). V. 10 MEDICAL FACILITIES V.10.1 MEDICAL CARE AND THE WILL OF GOD THE PHYSICIAN NOT A PRIMARY MONASTIC OFFICIAL Sed et vos alloquor fratres egregios, qui humani corporis salutem sedula curiositate tractatis, et confugientibus ad loca sanctorum officia beatae pietatis impenditis, tristes passionibus alienis, de periclitantibus maesti, susceptorum dolore confixi, et in alienis calamitatibus merore proprio semper attoniti; ut, sicut artis vestrae peritia docet, languentibus sincero studio serviatis, ab illo mercedem recepturi, a quo possunt pro temporalibus aeterna retribui. . . . I salute you, distinguished brothers, who with sedulous care look after the health of the human body and perform the function of blessed piety for those who flee to the shrine of holy men—you who are sad at the sufferings of others, sorrowful for those who are in danger, grieved at the pain of those who are received, and always distressed with personal sorrow at the misfortunes of others . . . Cassiodorus, Institutiones I, chap. 31.1 1 Cassiodori Senatoris Institutiones, I, chap. 31, ed. Mynors, 1937, 78-79; translation by Leslie Webber Jones, An Introduction to Divine and Human Readings, 1946, 135-36. The Rule of St. Benedict contains no clue as to whether a monastery was to be provided with a permanent staff of physicians,2 2 The term medicus appears only twice in the Rule (chaps. 27 and 28). All that can be inferred from these occurrences is that St. Benedict held the profession in high esteem, since in his discussion of the various forms of punishment to be administered to unruly brothers, he equates the wisdom displayed by an exemplary abbot with the prudence displayed in the procedures followed by a skilled physician. Benedicti Regula, chaps. 27 and 28, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 82-86; ed. McCann, 1952, 76-79; ed. Steidle, 1952, 216-19. and all later available sources disclose without any shadow of doubt that the physician stood outside the hierarchy of the monastery's regular administrative officers (provost, dean, porter, cellarer, chamberlain, infirmarer, etc.). The title carried no official status; but was granted to monks, who by their special studies and devotion had demonstrated unusual proficiency and knowledge in the art of healing. CASSIODORUS ON THE ART OF HEALING Cassiodorus the Senator (ca. 480-ca. 575) in a chapter "On Doctors" of his widely read Introduction to Divine and Human Readings, written for the instruction of his monks some time after 551,3 3 Cassiodori Institutiones, loc. cit. refers to the brothers who "look after the health of the human body" as men "who 410. PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE OF THE PHYSICIANS SHOWN FULL SIZE; 1:192 The Physicians' House shares a site with the Medicinal Herb Garden in the northeast corner of the monastery tract. The house belongs to a sub-group of the guest and service buildings of the Plan, of which the communal hall is surrounded on only three sides by peripheral rooms. Other variants of this smaller format are the House of the Gardener (fig. 426), the House for Cows and Cowherds (fig. 489), and the House for Foaling Mares and their Keepers (fig. 487). The proximity of the physicians to their garden reflects the contemporary state of pharmacy, which lay largely in the realm of botanicals, as the authorities of Dioscurides, Isidore, and many others attest. The physicians' duties included compounding and dispensing medicines; their house is provided with a secure room especially designated for storage of medication. will receive their reward from Him by whom eternal rewards may be paid for temporal acts."4 4 Ibid. He lists as standard medical works to be studied for instruction in this specialized craft: the book on herbs by Dioscurides; the Latin translations of the works of Hippocrates and Galen (especially the latter's Therapeutics, addressed to the philosopher Glauco); an anonymous work compiled from various authors; the book On Medicine by Caelius Aurelius; Hippocrates' On Herbs and Cures as well as various other medical treatises. He informs his readers that he had collected copies of all of these works for future use, and that these copies "are stored away in the recesses of our library" (i.e., the library of the monastery of Vivarium, which he had founded and for the monks of which the Institutiones were written).5 5 Ibid. Like the later medieval attitude toward medicine, Cassiodorus' view about the efficacy of medical care is tinted by the belief that the ultimate decision about sickness and health are the concern of the Lord; and this ambivalence between reliance on physical care and limitations imposed upon it by divine predestination he expresses clearly when admonishing the brothers: "Learn, therefore, the properties of herbs and perform the compounding of drugs punctiliously; but do not place your hope in herbs and do not trust health to human council. For although the art of medicine be found to be established by the Lord . . . who without doubt grants life to men, makes them sound" (et ideo discite quidem naturas herbarum commixtionesque specierum solicita mente tractate; sed non ponatis in herbis spem, non in humanis consiliis sospitatem. nam quamvis medicina legatur a Domino constituta, ipse tamen sanos efficit, qui vitam sine dubitatione concedit).6 6 Ibid. STUDY &amp; TRANSMISSION OF CLASSICAL MEDICINE The Cassiodorian attitude had a profound effect on later medieval thinking. It was responsible not only for the fact that the science of medicine, despite its spiritual limitations remained a highly respected avocation, but also for the establishment of its study and transmission as a subject worthy of being practiced in monastic schools of learning. 411.

INFIRMARY PLAN [redrawn after Hope and Bilson, 1907] In its original form the infirmary hall of Kirkstall may have been very like the castle hall of Leicester, a reconstruction of which is shown in figure 339. Pre-Norman monastic infirmaries of England were probably built entirely in timber. Under the influence of Norman church construction, not only were the walls built in stone, but even the free-standing inner posts came to be replaced by masonry arcades. At Kirkstall this change was made in the 14th century, in adjustment to a trend that in other places such as Canterbury (I, 70, fig. 52.A) had begun as early as mid-11th century. In many monasteries, consequently, the study and propagation of these skills was held in high esteem. The oldest catalogue of the library of the Abbey of St. Gall lists no fewer than six medical treatises.7 7 See Meyer von Knonau's remarks to chap. 31 in Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 124 note 422 and the sources there cited; as well as Meier, 1885, 116-17 and Clark, 1920, 126. The Abbots Grimoald (841-872) and Hartmut (872-883) increased these holdings by each bequeathing to the monastic library one medical book.8 8 Meyer von Knonau, 1877 and Meier, 1885, loc. cit. Among the actually surviving medical treatises of St. Gall, written in the ninth century, there are extracts from the works of Hippocrates and Galen (Cod. 44), a book on cures through herbs and animal extracts (Cod. 217), a large collection of medical prescriptions (Cod. 751), a heavily used list of pharmaceutical prescriptions (Cod. 759), as well as a collection of smaller medical treatises written by the hand of an Irish monk.9 9 Ibid. Abbot Grimoald (841-872) can be singled out as one who apparently took a special interest in the art of healing, since it is to him that Walahfrid Strabo dedicated his famous poem, Hortulus, in which the virtues of medicinal herbs are extolled.10 10 Cf. below. Other monks of St. Gall reputed to have been physicians of great distinction were Iso and Notker II, surnamed Medicus. Iso is praised by Ekkehart IV for his skill at making salves and is reported to have healed blind men, lepers and paralytics with his ointments.11 11 Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, chap. 31. ed. Meyer von Knonau. 1877, 124; ed. Helbling, 1958, 71-73. The same author proclaims Notker II the most famous of all.12 12 Ibid., chap. 123, ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 398-401; ed. Helbling, 1958, 205-6. For further information about this outstanding monk, who distinguished himself as poet, painter and musician as well, see Helbling's index sub verbo Notker. Frequently performing unbelievable wonders of healing, he was known far and wide in the country as one of the greatest monastic urologists.13 13 Ibid., chap. 123. It is of this Notker that Ekkehart tells the amusing story (widely quoted in histories of medieval medicine) how the Duke of Bavaria tried to test his medical perspicacity by sending him, instead of a sample of his own urine, that of a pregnant woman. Notker, after examining the sample, without any apparent sign of suspicion made the solemn announcement: "God is about to bring to pass an unheard of event; within thirty days the Duke will give birth to a child." On early medieval medicine in general, see MacKinney, 1937 and 1965. On Notker specifically, idem, 1937, 45-46; and 1965, 13-14. The names of other monks skilled in this science are listed in the Necrologium of St. Gall.14 14 See the notes of Meyer von Knonau in Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, op. cit., 401, note 1435. V.10.2 HOUSE OF THE PHYSICIANS Besides the Monks' Infirmary and the sick ward in the Novitiate,15 15 See above, pp. 311-15. the Plan provides for three other medical installations: the House of the Physicians, the Medicinal Herb Garden, and the House for Bloodletting, all of which are situated in the northeast corner of the monastery next to the Monks' Infirmary. The House of the Physicians (fig. 410) forms the center of the group. It is separated from the House for Bloodletting by a wall or fence and has no direct connection with the Infirmary. The house is small and almost square in shape (37½ feet by 42½ feet). Its principal room is designated as "the hall of the physicians" (domus PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE OF THE PHYSICIANS. AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION 413.A 413.B GROUND PLAN AND TRANSVERSE SECTION Our reconstruction of the House of the Physicians is only one choice of several possible alternatives. Despite the inclusion of corner fireplaces in the physicians' private aisle and the aisle for the critically ill—a feature which elsewhere has called for masonry walls—the exterior walls of this house could have been entirely of timber (a possibility we have demonstrated in reconstructing the Gardener's House, figs. 427.A-F, where similar conditions obtain). On the other hand, these walls could also have been built all in masonry, as is shown in the House for Distinguished Guests (figs. 397.A-F). Above is a third alternative: the entrance wall is timber, all the others are masonry. medicorum) and is furnished with the customary open fireplace with louver overhead. The western aisle of the house is used as a "bedroom for the critically ill" (cubiculum ualde Infirmorum); the eastern aisle serves as the "dwelling of the chief physician" (mansio medici ipsius), while the lean-to in the rear of the house is a "repository for drugs and medicaments" (armarium pigmentorum). Both the bedroom for the sick and the physician's quarters are provided with corner fireplaces and their own privies. Measuring only 37½ feet by 42½ feet the House of the Physicians is one of the smaller guest and service buildings. Its sick room, nevertheless, was large enough to accommodate eight beds. We should imagine the interior of this building to have looked very much like the thirteenth century Hospital of St. Mary's in Chichester, (fig. 343),16 16 For St. Mary's Hospital in Chichester, see above p. 103 and figs. 341-343. except, of course, that the Physicians' House on the Plan is considerably smaller and its aisles were probably separated from the common hall in the center by wall partitions between the posts. Another building, somewhat smaller than St. Mary's Hospital although still twice the length of the House of the Physicians, was the Infirmary of the Abbey of Kirkstall, dating from around 1220 (fig. 412), whose roof was originally held up by two rows of wooden PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE OF THE PHYSICIANS. AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION 413.C In the center: a window admitting light to the room where the pharmaceutical drugs are stored. To either side: the privies of the physicians and the critically ill. 413.D Our assumption that the gable walls were half-timbered is purely conjectural. They could of course as well have been built in masonry. 413.E Locating the fireplaces in the outer corners of the aisles keeps the chimney stacks at a safe distance from the inflammable roof. 413.F Two trusses, in addition to the gable walls, would have been entirely sufficient to carry the roof of this relatively small building. NORTH, SOUTH AND WEST ELEVATIONS AND LONGITUDINAL SECTION SCALE 1/16 INCH = 1 FOOT [1:192] posts which were later replaced by masonry arcades.17 17 For the Infirmary of Kirkstall Abbey, see Hope and Bilson, 1907, 38-43. The Infirmary Hall of Kirkstall Abbey was 83 feet long; its nave had a width of 31 feet, and the aisles, each a width of 11 feet. The main entrance lay in the western gable wall; another smaller door gave access through the southern long wall. In the easternmost bay of the north aisle there was a large fireplace which may have been used for cooking, as the kitchen was some distance away. The existence of wooden posts in the original building can be inferred from the sockets in the original stone bases that supported these posts. Some of these bases are preserved. The House of the Physicians on the Plan is the Carolingian prototype for this type of building. It is one of only a few buildings on the Plan in which the main room with the open fireplace is directly accessible from the outside.18 18 Others are the House of the Gardener and His Crew, see below, pp. 203ff; the House of the Cows and Cowherds, see below, pp. 279ff; the House for the Foaling Mares and Their Keepers, see below, pp. 287ff. We have reconstructed this side of the house as a straight timber-framed gable wall (fig. 413A-F), with infillings of daubed wattlework, reaching to the ridge of the roof. Because of the presence of corner fireplaces in the physician's bedroom and in the room for the critically ill, we have rendered the walls against which these fireplaces were built in masonry. The architectural privacy of both the physicians and their critical patients— attainable only by wall partitions and ceilings separating their quarters from the common source of light and air in the center room—created, of course, a need for supplementary fenestration in the walls of these rooms. The isolated location of the House of the Physicians and its rigid separation from all other buildings have given rise to the opinion that it served primarily as an isolation ward for patients with communicable diseases.19 19 Keller, 1844, 28; Willis, 1848, 109; Leclercq, 1924, col. 102. It appears to me more plausible to assume that it was the place where the monastery's serfs and workmen were taken when their condition became critical, since laymen could not be admitted to the Monks' Infirmary. The monks had their own ward for persons stricken with acute illness, and this could also have been used as a separation ward for monks afflicted with communicable diseases. The physicians were obviously not only in charge of the patients who were bedded in the Physician's House, but also attended to the sick in the adjacent Infirmary of the Monks and took care of the treatments administered in the House for Bloodletting. That they were not always from the ranks of the regular monks may be gathered from Abbot Adalhard's Directives for the Abbey of Corbie, where two physicians (medici duo) are listed as laymen.20 20 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 1, ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 367; and translation, III, 103. Hildemar, in his commentary on the Rule, lists as instruments indispensable to the physician: the bloodletting tools (fleuthomus), the book of herbs (herbarius liber), the medicaments and tools required for their preparation (pigmentum ferramenta quibus incidit), and "all such other similar things with the aid of which the physician performs his craft of healing" (et reliqua his similia, quibus medicamen medicus operatur).21 21 Expositio Hildemari, ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 139. V.10.3 MEDICINAL HERB GARDEN The medicinal herb garden (herbularius) lies in the northeastern corner of the monastery site, immediately east of the House of the Physicians. It is a small intimate garden, 37½ × 27½ feet (fig. 414). Like the Monks' Vegetable Garden, it is surrounded by a wall or a fence, but the arrangement of the planting beds differs. In the Vegetable Garden the planting beds are separated from the walls by a peripheral walk, so that each bed can be cultivated from all four sides. In the medicinal herb garden a row of planting beds clings to each wall. This seemingly insignificant rearrangement of beds in relation to the wall is, according to Wolfgang Sörrensen, the first step away from the "utility garden" (Nutzgarten) to the "pleasure garden" (Ziergarten).22 22 "Die vier Wände stehen nicht kahl ringsum, sie werden vielmehr von dem schönen Wachstum der Beete gekränzt, sodass der Wandelnde, wo er auch sein mag, von Beeten umgeben, gleichsam eingehüllt ist." On this aspect of monastic gardening and planting, see Sörrensen, in Studien, 1962, 241-43 and 263ff. It would, nevertheless, be wrong to classify the herb garden on the Plan of St. Gall as a "Ziergarten." The primary function of its plants is a practical one: they furnish the physician with the pharmaceutical products needed for his cures. As in the Monks' Vegetable Garden, each planting bed is reserved for the cultivation of a single species. There are sixteen in all: 1. lilium lily (lilium candidum L.) 2. rosas garden rose (rosa gallica L.) 3. fasiolo climbing bean (dolichos melanophtalmus L.) 4. sata regia pepperwort (satareia hortensis L.) 5. costo costmary (tanacetum blasamita L.) 6. fena greca greek hay (trigonella foenum graecum L.) 7. rosmarino rosemary (rosmarinus officinalis L.) 8. menta mint (mentha piperita L.) 9. saluia sage (salvia officinalis L.) 10. ruta rue (ruta graveolens L.) 11. gladiola iris (iris germanica L.) 12. pulegium pennyroyal (mentha pulegium L.) 13. sisimbria water cress (mentha aquatica L.) 14. cumino cumin (cuminum cyminum L.) 15. lubestico lovage (levisticum officinale L.) 16. feniculum fennel (anethum foeniculum L.)23 23 The modern Latin plant names listed in parentheses are taken from Wolfgang Sörrensen's article on the plants of the Plan. See Studien, 1962, 223ff. A charming contemporary description of a garden of this type is Walahfrid Strabo's Hortulus, written around 845 in PLAN OF ST. GALL. MEDICINAL HERB GARDEN 414. PLAN OF ST. GALL. MEDICINAL HERB GARDEN 414.X 414.Y PLOT PLAN SHOWING RELATIONSHIP OF HEALTH &amp; MEDICAL FACILITIES The plot plan suggests two traffic patterns within the Infirmary areas. Moving north, monks and serfs needing medical attention could leave the Church after services and report to whichever medical facility they were assigned. The Monks' Infirmary was available only to regular monks; the House for Bloodletting was probably used by both monks and serfs. The critically ill were lodged with the physicians; probably serfs or other laymen with minor infirmities were treated where they lodged. Moving southward on the site, the physicians might make daily rounds: conducting or overseeing bloodletting; at the bath and kitchen for the ill recommending therapy and special diet, supplies for which might be sent for from the small stock of luxuries afforded the Abbot in his own nearby kitchen; thence reporting directly to the Abbot himself (as was their charge and his own) concerning the ill, recommending further treatment for some, or swifter cures for suspected malingerers. At mid-point in this course the physicians could stop in the Chapel and Cloister for the Ill to advise recuperating brothers. It would be an oversight to regard these economies of movement and communication as happy accidents; on the contrary, a high degree of skill and consciousness in such matters helped the Benedictines eventually to influence the affairs of Carolingian Europe, and gave the Plan of St. Gall its unique stature as an architectural plan. The herbs to be cultivated in this small garden are selected for their medicinal properties. Their renascence each spring under the care of man, after the plants had either died altogether or only back to their roots during winter, has been described by Walahfrid Strabo in an account of great poetic beauty (Hortulus) as a recurring manifestation of the forces of life imparted to nature by Divine creation. The physicians cared directly for the critically ill and for those to be bled; their chief duties in addition were making medicines, and prescribing courses of treatment that might be administered by others. From the nearby garden they could pluck fresh the plants needed to compound the poultices, purges, infusions, and simples that were the main concerns of pharmacy in the 9th century. 415.

Then come the showers of Spring, from time to time Watering our tiny crop, and in its turn The gentle moon caresses the delicate leaves. WALAHFRID STRABO, HORTLUS, verse 46-55 Payne and Blunt, eds., 1966, 28-29 the monastery of Reichenau.24 24 Walahfrid Strabo, Hortulus, ed. Dümmler, in Mon. Germ. Hist., Poetae Latini Aevi Carolini, II, 1884, 335ff; and ed. Näf and Gabathuler, 1957. The poet relates how in the early spring he rushes into this garden, weeds out the nettles, and covers the soil with manure which he carries out in baskets. As soon as the soil is permeated with the fermenting action of this substance and fanned by the warm winds from the south, he turns it over with the spade, and frames the planting beds with boards to prevent the humus from sliding off onto the walks. Then he sets out his seedlings and in the following weeks observes with empathy the miracle of nature's rejuvenation in the growth of plants whose shape and physical characteristics he describes with a sharpness of visual definition that reminds one of the much later plant and water studies of Albrecht Dürer. Nine of the sixteen plants listed in the herb garden on the Plan were also grown in Walahfrid Strabo's garden. All of these plants, as botanists stress, could be raised in the warm climate of the island monastery of Reichenau,25 25 Sierp, 1925, 770. and all of them, with the exception of pumpkin and melon, had medicinal value. In the cultivation of these gardens and the medical uses to which they were put, the monks leaned heavily on the classical tradition. But they did not expand just the traditional medical use of plants and herbs; the benefits they brought to the art of cooking may have surpassed the contributions their gardens made to medicine.26 26 For the history and medicinal functions of these plants, I refer to the detailed accounts of Sierp (1925, passim) Fischer (1929, passim), Sieg (1953, passim), and Sörrensen in Studien, 1962, passim. From the monasteries the use of herbs spread to the nobles and the peasants, and thus, eventually, herbs became an integral part of every kitchen garden.27 27 The pains that were taken in the preparation of certain potions made from these herbs border on the unbelievable. In illustration of this is a recipe for a seasoning substance, described in a manuscript of St. Gall, which I cannot resist bringing to the attention of the reader, since it is published in a journal not available to many: Fish which are fatty by nature, like salmon, eels, shad (alase), sardines, or herring, are caught, and this mixture is made from them and from dried fragrant herbs and salt: a very solid and well-pitched vat is prepared, holding three or four modii, and dry fragrant herbs are taken both from the garden and the field, for instance, anise, coriander, fennel, parsley, pepperwort, endive, rue, mint, watercress, privet, pennyroyal, thyme, marjoram, betony, agrimony. And the first row is strewn from these in the bottom of the vat. Then the second row is made of the fish: whole if they are small, and cut to bits if large. Above this a third row of salt two fingers high is added, and the vat should be filled to the top in this manner, with the three rows of herbs, fish, and salt alternating each over the other. Then it should be covered with a lid and left so for seven days. And when this period is past, for twelve days straight the mixture should be stirred every day clear to the bottom with a wooden paddle shaped like an oar. After this the liquid that has flowed out of the mixture is collected, and in this way a liquid or sauce [?; omogarum] is made from it. Two sesters of this liquid are taken and mixed with two half sesters of good wine. Then four bunches [manipuli] a piece of dry herbs are thrown into this mixture, to wit, anise and coriander and pepperwort; also a fistful of fenugreek seed is added, and thirty or forty grains of pepper spices, three pennyweights (?) of costmary, likewise of cinnamon, likewise of cloves. These should be pulverized and mixed with the same liquid; then this mixture is to be cooked in an iron or bronze pot until it boils down to the measure of one sester. But before it is cooked down, a half pound [libram semissem] of skimmed honey should be added to the same. And when it is fully cooked in the manner of a drink [more potionum] it should be strained through a bag until it is clear. And it should be poured hot into a bag, strained and cooled and kept in a well-pitched bowl for seasoning viands. Recipe quotation after Mitteilungen der antiquarischen Gesellschaft, Zürich, XII, No 6; Bikel, 1914, 99-100. 416. PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR BLOODLETTING In the Middle Ages bleeding was used to remedy almost every known disease, to such excess that public opinion eventually turned against the procedure. It is, even today, used as a cure for a small number of pathological conditions where other means fail—but nowhere, now, to the extent of justifying the construction of special houses for bleeding. The Plan of St. Gall reveals with unique precision the appearance of this extinct species of house in the 9th century. V.10.4 HOUSE FOR BLOODLETTING DESCRIPTION OF HOUSE fleotomatis hic gustandum &amp;#x0288; potionariis28 28 Fleotomatus is a common medieval form for classical Latin phlebotomatus, from Greek ???β?τ????ν, "to open a vein" and ???β?τ??&amp;#x1f77; ?, "bloodletting." The ? between gustandum and potionariis was correctly transcribed as vel by Keller, 1844, and all subsequent writers. Cf. Battelli, 1949, 110. Here is the place for bloodletting and for purging The House for Bloodletting (fig. 416) lies west of the Physicians' House and consists of a large rectangular space 35 feet by 45 feet. It is furnished with a central fireplace with the customary louver and contains, besides this traditional heating device, four additional corner fireplaces as well, doubtless in consideration of the weakened condition of the monks after being bled. The wall space between these fireplaces is taken up by six benches and tables (mensae) on which the monks were bled and purged. The primary function of this separate house, as Leclercq has correctly pointed out, is to relieve the Monks' Infirmary of the many people who were to receive the incision of the lancet as a cure for a vast variety of ailments, real and imaginary.29 29 Leclercq, 1924, col. 103. PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR BLOODLETTING The vulnerable condition in which patients found themselves through the process of bleeding required that the House for Bloodletting be well heated. This was accomplished by installation of four corner fireplaces, in addition to the traditional open fireplace in the center of the building. Safety from fire hazards would require that the walls of the House for Bloodletting be built in masonry. 416.X.2 TRANSVERSE SECTION LOOKING EASTWARD Without doubt Carolingian builders could have covered a house 35 feet wide with a single span (the nave of the Church after all had a span of 40 feet) but in most medieval buildings such a span would have had additional support in two rows of free-standing inner posts, if more than 25 feet wide. For this reason in our reconstruction we have introduced four additional inner posts carrying roof plates, which in the longitudinal direction of the building are slightly cantilevered to support the rafters of the hips of the roof. 416.X.1 PLAN AT GROUND LEVEL AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION 416.X.3 LONGITUDINAL SECTION, LOOKING SOUTHWARD 416.X.5 ELEVATION LOOKING NORTHWARD 416.X.4 ELEVATION LOOKING SOUTHWARD 416.X.6 ELEVATION LOOKING WESTWARD Caring for the ill was a primary Christian, and therefore also an important monastic occupation, and included study and transmission of teachings of the great physicians of classical times. Yet monastic tradition also made it clear that the "ultimate decision about sickness and health" was "the concern of the Lord," not of man (see above, p. 176), which may explain why the physician, although his arts were often performed by monks, was not a member of the monastery's regular staff of administrative officers. Among monastic foundations, the separate House for Bloodletting is, we believe, unique to the Plan of St. Gall, attesting the high curative and prophylactic value attached to this procedure, and demonstrating the perspicuity of the designers of the Plan, who separated this medical facility from the infirmary. This made sense because of the large number of monks to be bled, and their convalescent state for a few days afterward. If the full monastic complement of 130 at St. Gall were to be bled at six-week intervals (1,170 bleedings in a year) as was customary at Ely (cf. p. 188 below), the Infirmary alone could hardly have served both those with longer-term or contagious illnesses requiring lengthy recuperation or isolation, and those merely recovering from bleeding. 417. LUTTRELL PSALTER (1340). LONDON, BRITISH MUSEUM, ADD. MS 42130, FOL. 61 [By courtesy of the Trustees of the British Museum] A physician bleeds a patient under the interested gaze of a large kingfisher. The iconography of this bird is ancient and complex; with its ability to hurl itself into the water and then arise after having apparently drowned, it captured the Christian imagination to become a symbol for the resurrected Christ. Perhaps its association with the act of bleeding symbolizes the hope of the patient for restored health. MONASTIC VIEWS ON BLEEDING The Rule of St. Benedict is silent on the subject of bleeding,30 30 The word flebotomatus does not occur in the Rule; see the index of words in Benedicti regula, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 175ff. and there is no certainty as to what point in history bleeding became a regular practice in monastic life. A description in Bede's Ecclesiastical History of a case of unsuccessful bloodletting causing intensive swelling and nearly leading to the death of a nun, suggests that bleeding was a fully adopted form of medical treatment in the monasteries of England at the time of Theodore of Tarsus (669-690). The same story also reveals that when something went wrong with the operation this was likely to be attributed not to the use of infectious tools or other forms of medical malpractice, but to the fact that the operation was performed at the wrong time: "You have acted foolishly and ignorantly to bleed her on the fourth day of the moon," Bede records Bishop Wilfrid of Hexham to have exclaimed. "I remember how Archibishop Theodore of blessed memory used to say that it was very dangerous to bleed a patient when the moon is waxing and the Ocean tide flowing. And what can I do for the girl if she is at the point of death?"31 31 "Multum insipienter et indocte fecistis in luna quarta flebotomando. Memini enim beatae memoriae Theodorum archiepiscopum dicere, quia periculosa sit satis illius temporis flebotomia, quando et lumen lunae, et reuma oceani in cremento est. Et quid ego possum puellae, si moritura est facere?" Bede, Hist. Eccl., book V., chap. 3, ed. Plummer, I, 1896, 285; ed. Colgrave and Mynors, 1969, 460-61. (The passage was brought to my attention by C. W. Jones.) A book, De minutione sanguis, wrongly attributed by tradition to the Venerable Bede, recommends that the blood be let between March 25 and May 26, on the assumption that this was the season "during which the blood develops in the human organism" (quia tunc sanguis augmentum habet). After this period, the operation was to be undertaken only with a due regard for the qualities of the seasons and phases of the moon (sed postea observandae sunt qualitates temporum et cursus lunae).32 32 De minutione sanguis, ed. Migne, Patr. Lat., XC, 1862, cols. 959-62. With regard to the wrong attribution of this treatise to Bede see Jones, 1939, 88-89. The first synod of Aachen (816) abolished the custom according to which large segments of the community were bled at a fixed date, and ruled that individuals be bled according to need. It reaffirms the right of those who are exposed to this treatment to receive a fortifying diet of food and drink, including at least by implication the otherwise forbidden meats (Ut certum fleutomiae tempus non obseruent, sed unicuique secundum quod necessitas expostulat concedatur et specialis in cibo et potu tunc consolatio prebeatur).33 33 Synodi primae decr. auth., chap. 10, ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 459-60. The matter had already been taken up in the preliminary deliberation of this synod and had elicited some interesting remarks by Bishop Haito: See Statuta Murbacensia, chap. 12, ed. Semmler, op. cit., 445-46. The food for the monks who were bled was doubtlessly prepared in the kitchen of the Infirmary, which lies directly to the west of the House for Bloodletting. The number and length of the tables in this house would permit the simultaneous feeding of a maximum of thirty-two monks, if we count 2½ feet as the normal sitting space required by each monk, as we did in calculating the seating capacity of the Monk's Refectory.34 34 See above, I, 268. The number of monks to be bled on a single day could not exceed this figure; and if as many as thirty-two were bled in a single day, this operation could not have been extended to others, until the first group to be treated had gone through the entire cycle of convalescence, which involved several days of special treatment and care. 418.

The Grimani Breviary, of uncertain authorship, provenance, and even date, is one of the finest and most profusely illuminated manuscripts of its class; its 110 illuminations depict labors of the months and numerous other scenes from daily life, religious festivals, feasts of the saints. The illuminations are from many different hands, mostly Flemish, a few perhaps French; the style suggests a date nearer the start of the 16th century. MEDIEVAL PORTRAYALS OF BLEEDING A marginal illustration in the Luttrell Psalter (fig. 417) furnishes us with a realistic picture of the performance of this ubiquitous craft. It shows a physician standing and bleeding a patient from the right arm. The patient is seated on a stool and holds a bowl in his left hand to catch the blood. He keeps his right arm steady by propping it on a staff or pole while the physician places his left foot on that of the patient. This appears to have been a standard position for this kind of operation. It occurs again, almost feature by feature, in the representation of a similar scene in the Grimani Breviary (fig. 418).35 35 For the Luttrell Psalter, see Millar, 1932, pl. 16; for the Grimani Breviary, see Morpurgo and de Vries, I, 1903, pl. 18. In both cases the blood is taken from the anticubital vein, in the crook of the elbow, a preferred place for bloodtaking even today, since here one of the principal veins comes close to the surface and exposes itself in a relatively fixed position. The staff or pole, apart from steadying the patient in a general sense, adds muscular control to the operation, as it enables the patient to increase or diminish the flow of blood by locking his fist around the pole or conversely by relaxing his grip. PHLEBOTOMY: A MEDIEVAL PANACEA Phlebotomy was a medical omnium-gatherum used for curing a bewildering variety of ailments.36 36 For a general review of the practice of bloodletting, see MacKinney, 1937, 39ff., and Gougaud, 1930, 49-68. The Regimen sanitatis salernitanum, a widely read treatise on medicine, written at the end of the eleventh century for Robert, Duke of Normandy, the eldest son of William the Conqueror, probably by John of Milan, head of the faculty of the School of Medicine of Salerno at that time,37 37 For date and authorship, see Packard's introduction to Regimen sanitatis salernitanum, 1920, 24ff. defines its beneficial effects as follows: Phlebotomy clarifies the eyesight, strengthens mind and brain. It warms the marrow, purges the intestines, forces stomach and bowels into action. It purifies the senses, induces sleep, gives relief from boredom. It restores and strengthens hearing, voice and energy, facilitates speech, appeases ire, allays anxieties, and cures watering eyes.38 38 My prose translation follows the text published by Saint-Marc, 1880, 213-14, which is a little longer than the text published by Packard, op. cit., 176. The physician points out that the "superabundance of spirit" (spiritus uberius) that escapes with the blood is quickly replenished through the drinking of wine, while the weakness of the body sustained by bleeding is gradually repaired by the intake of food. FROM PHYSICIAN TO BARBER There is no reason to presume that in the early Middle Ages bloodletting was performed by persons other than trained physicians. Alcuin and Walahfrid Strabo refer to the practice as being performed by medici.39 39 See MacKinney, 1937, 39. But in the later Middle Ages physicians considered this operation to be beneath their dignity and conceded it to "barbers" and "professional bleeders" (rasatores et sanguinatores).40 40 Ibid., and for sources, Dubreuil-Chambardel, 1914, 213ff. In the twelfth century this change must have been well under way. A hint of the social milieu from which such secular bleeders may have emerged and how and where they may have received their training is found in the Chronicle of the Abbey of St. Trond, where it is said of one of the monastery's serfs, a recalcitrant oppidanus (inhabitant of a city) named Arnulf, that in return for the terms of a tenement granted to him by the abbey, he was not only to assist the monks whenever they were bled, but in addition to provide for the abbot's saddle and spurs, repair the abbey's window, and perform other minor services, such as keeping all of the monastery's locks in working condition.41 41 Rudolfi Gesta abbatum Trudonensium, Book IX, chap. 12, ed, Koepke, in Mon. Germ. Hist., Scriptores, X, 1852, 284. The passage refers to the period 1108-32: "Oppidanus quidam noster Arnulfus nomine patris quod sui Baldrici imitatus violentiam, terram tenera volebat sine servitio, quae debet servire fratribus ad omnem minutionem sanguinis eorum debet et alia minuta servitia ad utensilia camerae abbatis, scilicet quicquid de ferro ad sellam equitariam eius et ad calcaria et ad saumas componitur, dato sibi ab abbate ferro. Fractas vitreas fenestras monasterii, claustri, cellae abbatis, accepto et custode vitro, plumbo et stagno et caere et sumptu emendat. Claves omnes monasterii et scriniorum, dato sibi ferro, novat et renovat, similiter et de omnibus officinis claustri et curtis. RELIEF FROM DREARINESS OF DAILY ROUTINE Dom D. Knowles attributes the phenomenal spread of the practice of bloodletting in monastic life to the "general feeling of physical malaise" brought about by an unbalanced diet and the sedentary life of the monks, calling for some violent form of relief.42 42 Monastic Constitutions of Lanfranc, ed. Knowles, 1951, 152. One of the attractive features of its practice was that it gave relief from the dreariness of the daily routine and was associated with a fortifying regime of food, allowed in compensation for the loss of blood. This gave to the occasion a touch of recreative pleasure, which monastic discipline found it difficult to repress. RULES TO BE FOLLOWED IN THE PRACTICE OF BLEEDING A detailed account of special rules to be followed in the practice of bleeding will be found in Ulric's Antiquiores consuetudines (d. 1093) of the Monastery of Cluny43 43 Antiqiuores consuetudines Cluniacensis monasterii, collectore Udalrico Monacho Benedictino, Book. 11, chap. 21, ed. Migne, Patr. Lat., CXLIX 1882, cols. 709-10. and the chapter "Permission for Being Bled" in the Monastic Constitutions of Lanfranc.44 44 Monastic Constitutions of Lanfranc, ed. cit., 93-95. From a review of these, and a variety of other sources,45 45 For the sources of the summary that follows see the excellent, and fully documented chapter, "La phlébotomie monastique," in Gougard, 1930, 49-68. the routine of the monk who subjected himself to bloodletting went as follows: After having obtained formal permission to be bled (licentia minuendi) by petition to the chapter, the brother left the church at the end of the principal mass and went to the dormitory to exchange his vestments of the day (diurnales) for his clothing of the night (nocturnales) which he retained for the three days of rest that followed his operation. The operation was initiated with a brief prayer which began with the verse Deus in adjutorium meum intende. (In the Benedictine monastery this prayer was preceded by an inclination of the body called ante et retro.) The incision was made in the morning, save for the time of Lent, when it was done after vespers. The patients were issued bandages of linen (fasciae, ligaturae, ligamenta brachiorum, bendae, arcedo) with which to wrap their arms. Some consuetudinaries recommend that before being bled a monk should pass by the kitchen to have his arm warmed. During recovery the patients were not held to their regular duties in the choir, but had leave to rise later than the others and to recite only a part of the divine office. Moreover, they were at liberty to take walks in the monastery's vineyards and meadows. Their diet, as already mentioned, made allowance not only for the ordinarily forbidden meats, but also for greater abundance. During the periods when the rest of the community ate only one meal, the frater minuendus ate two; on all other occasions, three: the mixtum, the prandium and the coena. It is obvious that in view of all these special privileges, bloodletting acquired an attraction that in the minds of some of the more conservative members of the community bordered on dissipation; and the monastic consuetudinaries, indeed, abound with admonitions aimed at curtailing the spread of merriment, if not of outright breaches of discipline, with which this activity tended to be associated. A main concern of those who were in charge of monastic discipline was to prevent the seynies from coinciding with important religious festivities; others felt it necessary to restrict the repetition of the privilege to certain cycles. The monastery of St. Augustine in Canterbury allowed the monks to be bled in intervals of seven weeks; at Ely the interval was six; in other monasteries it was only five or four times per year that a monk could be bled. The reconstruction of the House for Bloodletting poses problems of a special kind. Safety of construction, in the presence of so many corner fireplaces, requires that its walls be built in masonry. The house is not inhabited by any permanent residents and serves one purpose only: bleeding and recovering from this treatment. There is no need for the designation of any internal boundaries between the primary function of the building and such subsidiary functions as sleeping or stabling animals which in the plans of other buildings led to the delineation of aisles and leanto's; and this is the reason, in our opinion, why the drafting architect showed it as a unitary all-purpose space. Yet the size of the building argues against the assumption that it was surmounted by a roof that spanned the entire width of the house in a single span. For the nave of a church a roof span of 35 feet would be normal practice in this period, but in a simple service structure it would be an anomaly. We have introduced in our reconstruction of the House for Bloodletting two inner ranges of roof-supporting posts whose presence cannot be proven from the simple analysis of the plan of this building.46 46 For analogous cases see above, pp. 166ff. (House for Knights and Vassals . . .); pp. 215ff (Granary) and pp. 271ff (House for Horses and Oxen). SITE PLAN V. 11 THE HOUSES FOR WORKMEN AND CRAFTSMEN V.11.1 INTRAMURAL PRACTICE OF CRAFTS BENEDICTINE AMBIGUITIES The Rule of St. Benedict did not specifically regulate the location of the monastic workshops. The only reference to artifices occurs in chapter 57 where St. Benedict stipulates "if there be craftsmen in the monastery, let them practice their crafts with all humility" and "let the goods always be sold a little cheaper than they are sold by people of the world."1 1 Benedicti Regula, chap. 57, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 132-33; ed. McCann, 1963, 128-29; ed. Steidle, 1952, 274-75. The conditional "if" clause of this sentence, which implies that under certain conditions the craftsmen were housed outside the monastic enclosure, caused confusion; the more so, since it contradicted the famous passage in the Rule that declares, the "monastery, if possible, should be so constituted as to contain within itself every necessity of life. . . so as to avoid that the monks stray outside of its bounds which is not good for their souls."2 2 See I, 241. CLARIFYING DIRECTIVES ISSUED AT AACHEN The first synod of Aachen (816) attempted to solve this problem, and Bishop Haito, in accordance with a directive issued there, ruled that the craftsmen "be instructed to perform their work henceforward not without, as heretofore, but within the monastic enclosure" (non forinsecus sicut actenus, sed intrinsecus).3 3 See I, 23. The Plan of St. Gall conforms with this rule and provides for two large buildings to take care of these activities: a Great Collective Workshop, in which the majority of the monastery's workmen and craftsmen work and live, and a House for the Coopers and Wheelwrights. The Great Collective Workshop lies directly south of the Refectory, between the Granary and the Monks' Bake and Brew House; the House for the Coopers and Wheelwrights is at the southwestern end of the claustral block, in convenient proximity to the Monks' Cellar and the House for Horses and Oxen. V.11.2 THE GREAT COLLECTIVE WORKSHOP Not counting the large untitled building in the northwestern corner of the monastery, this is the most spacious of the guest and service buildings of the Plan of St. Gall. It consists of a main building and an annex, separated from one another by a narrow court (fig. 419). The main building is 55 feet wide and 80 feet long; the annex is 27½ feet by 80 feet. Together with their court, which is 10 feet wide, these installations cover a surface area of 7,200 square feet. Their function is explained by the hexameter: Haec sub se teneat fr?m? qui tegmina curat4 4 Because of the wide variety of articles made in the Collective Workshop, the term tegmina (literally "coverings") cannot be translated in the narrow sense of "clothing" (as Keller, 1844, 14; Stephani, II, 1903, 41; Leclercq, in Cabrol-Leclercq, 1924, col. 103; and Reinhardt, 1952, 14, have done), but must be interpreted in the more comprehensive sense of "apparel," denoting, besides clothing, all the materials needed in the daily life of the monks, as well as all the tools required in the management of the monastic estate. Let him take charge of these things who takes care of the brothers' apparel. The monastic official referred to in this title is the Chamberlain, who is in charge of the production and maintenance of the monastery's material supplies and tools, including the community's footwear and clothing.5 5 For a more detailed account of his duties, see I, 335. THE MAIN BUILDING The chamberlain's hall and workshop The layout of the main house (fig. 419) is similar to that of the Outer School. In both cases, the center hall is divided by a median wall partition into two equal halves, each furnished with its own hearth and louver; however, in the Collective Workshop this partition extends across the entire width of the hall and has no doors between the two rooms thus segregated. Each has its separate entrance and exit, yet both are designated by the collective title, "the chamberlain's hall and workshop" (domus &amp; officina camerarii). The coupling of the denotation domus and officina makes clear that the two center spaces of the Great Collective Workshop perform the dual function of serving both as living room and as supplementary work space. It would be unreasonable to assume that the Chamberlain, who was in charge of the work performed in this house, also resided and slept there.6 6 This was the assumption of Keller, 1840, 30; Leclercq, 1924, col. 103; and Reinhardt, 1952, 14. His rank in the monastic polity, had he shared quarters with the workmen, would have called for a private bedroom with corner fireplace and private toilet facilities, which do not exist in this building. The Chamberlain either slept in the Dormitory for the regular monks, or, more likely, shared the sleeping quarters of the abbot, to whom he was closely attached not only by grave responsibilities of his office, but also—at least in some of the monastic orders—by certain specific duties of a personal nature.7 7 I am thinking of a passage in a description of the Chamberlain's duties by Abbot Meinhard of Maursmünster, written around 1144, in which it is said, "the chamberlain is in charge of the tables, the beds, and all the other household utensils in the abbot's house. He will have the abbot's horses ready at all times, will ride out with the abbot, and will attend to him in everything, as he goes to bed and as he rises." Du Cange, new ed., II, 1937, 49; and Schoepflin, II, 1775, 229. The two central halls of the house, designated as "the chamberlain's hall and workshop," are the rooms where the chamberlain conferred with his craftsmen, assigned workloads, and inspected the finished products. They were also the place where the workmen, in their hours of rest, could congregate around the open fire, prepare and eat their meals.8 8 Cf. our remarks on the places where the monastery's serfs and laymen ate, below, pp. 271-72. The designer of the Plan was aware of the fact that the work performed in these rooms required special lighting conditions, and he met this need with a double set of louvers capable of flooding the interior of this house with an abundance of light. Crafts performed in peripheral workshops Peripherally ranged around these two center spaces are the quarters of the workmen, measuring 12½ feet by 32½ feet and 12½ feet by 30 feet, respectively. They are distributed as follows: on the entrance side, to the left and right of the vestibule, the "shoemakers" (sutores) and the "saddlers" 419. PLAN OF ST. GALL. GREAT COLLECTIVE WORKSHOP MAIN WORKSHOP AND ITS ANNEX The layout of the main house here is identical with what we refer to as the "standard house" of the Plan: a large rectangular center space with open fireplace serving as living room, with peripheral outer rooms around it (figs. 392, 397, 402, 404, 407). The Workshop, as in the Outer School, is divided by a median wall partition into two center areas, each with its own fireplace. These rooms are designated the office and dwelling of the chamberlain, whose duty it was to oversee the craftsmen who used the shop. Although housing a great variety of activities, the shop was neatly balanced in its division: flanking the north vestibule were leatherworkers (shoemakers, saddlers); in the center, flanking the chamberlain's quarters were metalworkers (grinders, sword polishers); on the south were those engaged in finish work: woodworkers who made tools and utensils, and curriers who prepared leather for various purposes. In the Annex were placed those activities involving fire hazards (goldsmithing, blacksmithing) and the fullers, who probably shared some craft facilities with the curriers, across the aisle to their north. PLAN OF ST. GALL. GREAT COLLECTIVE WORKSHOP. AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION 420.B 420.A GROUND PLAN AND LONGITUDINAL SECTION This Workshop affords a notable embodiment of the enterprising and innovative spirit of the men who developed the Plan. In marked contrast to the secular world, where craftsmen tended to be isolated and scattered over a wider geographic area, perhaps among several villages, the workmen of the Plan were assembled under one roof. Here they manufactured tools, utensils, harness and saddle gear and footwear, as well as weaponry; the farrier as well as the goldsmith were housed here. The aisled hall, with its constructionally conditioned bay division, lent itself with ease to such intensive and disparate use. PLAN OF ST. GALL. GREAT COLLECTIVE WORKSHOP. AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION 420.D 420.C SOUTH ELEVATION AND NORTH ELEVATION The criteria for reconstructing this building are the same governing those of the reconstructions of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers (figs. 393.A-E), House for Distinguished Guests (figs. 397.A-F), and the Outer School (fig. 408.A-F). We have gone on the assumption that this workshop was built entirely in wood. The layout makes perfect sense if we presume the roof was supported by five principal trusses (fig. 420. A-B) with hips over each terminal bay. As in all other houses of this type there is only one entrance, in the middle of the northern long wall. PLAN OF ST. GALL. GREAT COLLECTIVE WORKSHOP. AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION 420.F 420.E WEST ELEVATION AND TRANSVERSE SECTION WITH ANNEX (AT RIGHT) Our assumption that the house had windows to admit light to the outer rooms is purely conjectural. They may have been needed for functional reasons, since these rooms were probably to be used for both sleeping and working. Windows were not part of the pre- and protohistoric tradition of this building type, because they afforded the risk that a house could be entered through them by enemies, a primary consideration for people living in small groups and at considerable distance from one another, and dependent solely upon themselves for defense. PLAN OF ST. GALL. GREAT COLLECTIVE WORKSHOP, ANNEX. AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION 421.C 421.B 421.A PLAN, LONGITUDINAL SECTION, AND NORTH ELEVATION The layout is identical with that of the Annex of the Abbot's House (fig. 251): a main space, internally divided into three areas for the performance of different tasks, plus a lean-to, also tripartite, serving as bedrooms for the Coopers and Wheelwrights. That the space between the main house and the annex should be interpreted as an open court may be inferred from its comparison with the Abbot's House (fig. 251) and the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers (fig. 392) where main house and annex are separated in a similar way. (sellarii). Their duties require no further comment. In the two lean-to's at the western and eastern end of the house are the "grinders or polishers of swords" (emundatores † politores gladiorum) and the "shieldmakers" (scutarii). Their presence is not surprising in view of the monastery's military obligations, discussed in an earlier chapter.9 9 See I, p. 347. The "grinders and polishers of swords" were probably also in charge of the production of the monastery's cutlery and other cutting tools.10 10 Each monk, as the reader may remember, was entitled to carry a knife on his belt; cf. I, p. 249. This is suggested by the fact that this work is not assigned to any other craftsmen listed on the Plan. By the same token, the shieldmakers, too, may have been involved in the manufacture of tools other than shields. The two rooms in the southern aisle of the house, to the left and right of the vestibule that gives access to court and annex, are occupied by the "turners" (tornatores) and the "curriers" (coriarii). The turners are the men who manufacture the wooden bowls, dishes, and trays that are used in eating, the handles of such tools as axes and hoes, and perhaps the smaller pieces of furniture, such as cupboards and chairs. Their work may also have included the making of wooden sculpture.11 11 Tornator is the classical and also the common medieval form. (Carolingian examples: Capitulare de villis, chap. 45, ed. Gareis, 1895, 49; Breve memorationis Walae Abbatis, ed. Semmler, 1963, in Corp. cons. mon., I, 422.) Tornarius occurs in a charter of Duke Brzestilav of Bohemia, written around 1052: "Aratores ad praedictas villas dedi Miross, Lasen, Seek. . . . Tornarium scutellarium Bozetham . . . et alium qui toreumata facit" (Du Cange, 2nd ed., 1938, 129). The curriers dress and prepare leather after tanning; they pare off roughnesses and inequalities and make the leather soft and pliable. Since the Plan does not provide for any special facilities for the manufacture of parchment, it is probable that the curriers' workshop was also the place where this important material was made. The stripping of hides, whether used for the production of parchment or other commodities, depended on the availability of water and lime, which was also needed by the fullers who were quartered in the Annex. It is no accident that the workshops of the curriers and the fullers face each other on either side of an open court, where lime pits and other baths can be installed easily.12 12 For more detail on the work of the fullers, see Singer, Holmyard, Hall, and Williams, II, 1956, 214ff, and 189ff. Presumptive number of craftsmen There is no doubt in my mind that the aisles and leanto's of the Great Collective Workshop were the sleeping quarters for the men who worked there. This was the traditional space for sleeping in this type of house.13 13 See above, p. 77; and on protohistoric houses, p. 45ff. To what extent the aisles and lean-to's were used additionally as workshops would have depended on the number of men they housed, and the amount of floor space left after they were bedded. If beds were arranged in a single file along the outer walls of the house, as is the case in most of the other places of the Plan where beds are shown,14 14 Cf. the arrangement of beds in the Abbot's House, the Lodging for Visiting Monks, the Schoolmaster's Lodging, the Porter's Lodging, and, of course, the Monks' Dormitory, which, because of its heavy occupancy, is a special case. On the traditional northern way of sleeping, cf. also above, p. 23. the main house could have accommodated twenty-eight workmen. Another four men could have been established with comfort in each of the three workshops of the Annex, which would bring the total of men in the Great Collective Workshop to forty. I do not know whether any good comparative figures are available for this sort of count. Abbot Adalhard of Corbie, whose monastery was considerably larger than that described on the Plan of St. Gall, lists the following as the regular contigent of laymen employed at Corbie: twelve matricularii [odd jobbers selected from among the poor] and thirty laymen. Of those: six at the first workshop, viz., three shoemakers, two saddlers, one fuller. At the second workshop: seventeen [Adalhard's arithmetic is wrong, the total of the individual workmen listed for the second workshop is eighteen not seventeen], viz., one at the supply room, six blacksmiths, two goldsmiths, two shoemakers, two shieldmakers, one parchment maker, one polisher, three carpenters. At the third workshop: three, viz., two porters at the cellar and the dispensary, one at the infirmary. Two helpers, viz., one at the place where the wood is stored in the bakehouse, one at the middle gate, four carpenters, four masons, two physicians, two at the vassals' lodge.15 15 . . . de Laicis: Matricularii duodecim, laici triginta. Ad primam camaram sex: sutores tres, ad caualos duo, fullo unus. Ad secundam camaram decem et septem: ex his ad camaram unus, fabri grossarii sex, aurifices duo, sutores duo, scutarii duo, pargaminarius unus, saminator unus, fusarii tres. Ad tertiam camaram tres: ad cellarium et dispensam portarii duo, ad domum infirmorum unus. Gararii duo, ad lignarium in pistrino unus, ad portam medianam unus, carpentarii quattuor, mationes quattuor, medici duo, ad casam uasallorum duo. Isti sunt infra monasterium. Consuetudines Corbeienses, ed. Semmler, in Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 367; and translation, III, 103. If we subtract from this roll those laymen who on the Plan of St. Gall are installed in other houses or have no special space assigned to them (physicians, carpenters, masons, and various others stationed at the Cellar, the Dispensary, and the Infirmary), the remaining number of laymen is twenty-one, including eleven who on the Plan of St. Gall are installed in the Annex (blacksmiths, goldsmiths, and metal founders). It is hard to say whether such a comparison has any validity, since Corbie, in addition to the craftsmen here listed, had also no fewer than 150 prebends (adult oblates, who received their daily sustenance in return for the performance of some craft or service),16 16 Cf. I, p. 341. many of whom may have helped to supplement the work of the regular craftsmen. In any case it appears to me safe to deduce from the layout of the Great Collective Workshop that at the time of Louis 422. PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR COOPERS &amp; WHEELWRIGHTS &amp; BREWERS' GRANARY The layout of this building is in essence the same as that for the Annex to the Great Collective Workshop, with the exception that there are no bedrooms, of course, associated with the Brewers' Granary. Of some significance as a trait of the general efficiency of the Plan is the large L- shaped yard lying to the west and south of this structure. It was large enough to afford turn-around access for carts bound for the granary, while carts or barrels under repair might be conveniently stored in the cul-de-sac forming the southern arm of the L. the Pious a crew of plus or minus forty artifices (not counting the coopers and wheelwrights installed in a separate building) was considered to be the normal contingent of craftsmen needed for the manufacture of the material requirements of a monastic settlement, comprised of 250 to 270 souls.17 17 For an estimate of the total number of persons accommodated in the monastery shown on the Plan, see I, p. 342. There is no question in my mind that the architect who drew the plan of the Great Collective Workshop not only had a clear idea of the number of men to be installed in this structure and how they should be distributed throughout the various workshops, but also was equally well informed about the space requirements involved in each individual craft, their functional interdependence, and the special demands for lighting, heating, and fire protection, as we shall see presently. As in all other buildings of this type, there is good reason to assume that the walls that separated the individual workshops from the center halls were not of rigid construction, since the workmen in these outer spaces depended on the two central fireplaces in the hall and the two louvers in the roof above them for their warmth and light. I should imagine that even the Workshop's interior looked like a large open barn with barriers substantial enough to give the workmen that autonomous feeling indispensable to the performance of their skills, yet not so obstructive as to preclude almost everyone's remaining in sight of each other. THE ANNEX The crafts performed in the annex The Annex (figs. 419 and 421) is as long as the main house, but furnished with a single aisle along its southern side and has a total depth of only 27½ feet. It is subdivided by cross partitions into three equal spaces, which contain the workshops of "goldsmiths" (aurifices), "blacksmiths" (fabri feram?torum), and "fullers" (fullones) and in the rear along the outer wall "their bedrooms" (eorundem mansiunculae). The annex has no separate entrance. It is accessible through the main building, from which it is separated by a courtyard 10 feet wide. 423. BOOKS OF HOURS (1460-1480), LABORS OF THE MONTH OF AUGUST MUSÉE CONDÉ, CHANTILLY. MS. 1362 [courtesy of the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris] Coopers work in the village street. Some are hammering hoops of tubs and barrels into final position with wooden mallets and wedges. Others plane and bevel staves on benches. Two sets of finished barrels are ready for shipment. They have the same shape as the small barrels drawn in the Cellar of the Plan of St. Gall (fig. I 225) and on the Roman and medieval monuments shown in figs. I 233 and I 234. The manuscript, once belonging to Adelaide of Savoy, Duchess of Burgundy and mother of Louis XV, is from the school of Jean Foucquet. It is one of a small group of manuscripts which frame the script with a narrative, rather than an ornamental, surround. (For other illustrations by the same hand in the same manuscript, see Bouissounouse, 1925, pl. i-xxiv.) 424. LUTTRELL PSALTER (1340) LONDON, BRITISH MUSEUM. ADD. MS. 42130, FOL. 163 The simple caisson, an old standard for cargo carts, appears on Trajan's column and in the Bayeux Tapestry, attesting the practicality of the form over many centuries. As farm cart it might with equal ease haul tuns, loose hay, bushels of turnips; the empty cart of the psalter reveals braided wattle sides that may have been removeable. Its spiked wheels and spike-shod horses indicate this cart type was intended for heavy work. If not entirely fanciful, the wheel diameter, compared with the size of the draft animals, may afford some notion of the size such a cart might attain. To put the workshops of the smiths and fullers under a separate roof and segregate them from the other craftsmen by an open court is an extremely sensible procedure. The fullers need pits for lye and fuller's clay. And the work of the smiths is associated with enervating noise and high intensity fires. Their equipment is heavier and requires more floor space than many of the other crafts. Hildemar lists as the blacksmiths' tools, the "hammer" (malleus), the "anvil" (incus), the "prongs" (forcipes), the "bellows" (follis), the "turning wheel" (rota), the "grapple hook" (foscina), and the "hearth" (focus),18 18 Expositio Hildemari, ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 139.14. and tells us that with these they manufacture "swords, lances, hoes, axes, and files."19 19 Ibid., 386.8. The task of the fullers was to cleanse, shrink, and thicken clothes by moisture, heat, and pressure. Their work was dependent on access to open pits where the cloth could be soaked in water mixed with detergents (fuller's clay) absorbing the grease and oil of the cloth. There is no indication on the Plan of St. Gall that this work was mechanized, unless the fullers were permitted to use one of the water-powered triphammers in the nearby Mortar House for this work.20 20 For more detail on this see below, p. 236ff. Absence of tailors and weavers Attention must also be drawn to the absence of facilities for tailors (sartores). This may suggest that the monks themselves did the main work of cutting and tailoring clothes in the large Vestiary that occupied the floor above the Refectory—a conjecture that is corroborated by a remark in Hildemar's commentary to the Rule of St. Benedict. It is said there that the monks who are engaged in tailoring clothes will have to disrupt their work instantly when the bell for the divine service is struck, and must not even pull the needle, awl, and thread (seta, literally "bristle" or "bristly hair") out of the piece of cloth or leather on which they are working.21 21 Expositio Hildemari, ed. cit., 192.24 and 488.2. Lastly, it must be noted that the monastery has no facilities for weaving. This is easily explained, because weaving was historically a craft performed by women22 22 North of the Alps, the work of weaving was performed in buildings dug partly into the ground, which also served as storage places for fruit and other crops. They were described by Tacitus and by Pliny. In Medieval Latin they are referred to either as hypogeum (in view of their location) or as genecium (because of the sex of their occupants) or as textrina (because of the trade carried on in them). For more details and sources see, Heyne, I, 1899, 46ff. For directives concerning the maintenance of genicia on crown estates, see Capitulare de villis, chaps. 31 and 49, ed. Gareis, 1895, 42 and 51. who, of course, had no place in a monastic settlement for men. Moreover, it is quite possible that most of the monks' clothing was not woven, but produced by the process of felting, i.e., the bringing together of masses of loose fibers 425.A PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR COOPERS &amp; WHEELWRIGHTS &amp; BREWERS' GRANARY AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION The association of two workshops with a granary is seemingly in recognition of the size of the space required for all three activities: no less than a barn-size structure would provide sufficient floor space for making large barrels and utility carts and fittings and a threshing floor. Temporary storage of unfinished and damaged carts and barrels was probably one consideration determining the size of this building. We have reconstructed this house according to the same criteria that guided that of the Annex of the Great Collective Workshop and that of the Abbot's House. of wool under the combined influence of heat, moisture, and friction until they became firmly interlocked in every direction. This task, of course, could be performed by the fullers. It is an interesting commentary on the social and economic structure of the period that it is within this primarily industrial environment, composed of laymen and serfs, that we also find the noble craftsmen, the goldsmiths, who furnished the church with its sacred vessels and reliquaries and the library with its precious jeweled covers for books. The Great Collective Workshop is an impressive example of industrial organization. Contracting into one establishment practically all the services required for the community's material survival, it reveals on the level of the service building the same propensity for systematic architectural integration which in the layout of the Church had led to a combination of liturgical functions that had formerly been distributed over separate sanctuaries.23 23 Cf. I, 187ff and 208ff. The same spirit had produced an equally ingenious combination of functions in the great architectural complex that encompasses the Novitiate and the Infirmary.24 24 Cf. I, 311-21. V.11.3 HOUSE FOR COOPERS &amp; WHEELWRIGHTS The workshops and sleeping quarters of the Coopers and Wheelwrights are installed in a rectangular building, 90 feet long and 35 feet wide (fig. 422), connected to the Granary of the Brewers. Its axis runs from south to north, and it is located midway between the Monks' Cellar and the PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR COOPERS &amp; WHEELWRIGHTS &amp; BREWERS' GRANARY 425.C 425.B WEST ELEVATION, LONGITUDINAL SECTION AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION House for Horses and Oxen, both of which are dependent on its services. That it is part of the installations that come under the supervision of the Chamberlain is expressed in the superscribed hexameter: Hic habet fr?m? semper uota minister Here let him who administers to [the needs] of the brothers discharge his responsibilities The house is subdivided by a median cross partition into two equal halves each of a surface area of 27½ feet by 35 feet, one designated as the "hall of the coopers," (tunnariorum domus), the other as the "hall of the wheelwrights" (tornari- orum). Their sleeping quarters (famulorum cubi) are in an aisle attached to the western side of the house, likewise divided into two equal halves, each of which is capable of bedding five workmen. The craft of the coopers needs no further comment. The product of their handiwork is proudly displayed on the Plan itself in the form of two impressive rows of barrels shown in the ground plan of the Monks' Cellar (fig. 225). These show them capable of producing the staves and hoops for casks 15 feet long and with a central diameter of 10 feet. They also made wooden tubs, pails, churns, and other even-staved vessels for holding liquids used in bathing, laundering, cooking, and cheese making; or for PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR COOPERS &amp; WHEELWRIGHTS &amp; BREWERS' GRANARY 425.D Each of the workshops in this house is 30 feet long (12 standard modules) and 25 feet wide in the work areas (10 standard modules), suggesting that the part of the structure housing facilities for coopers and wheelwrights was divided lengthwise into six bays, each 10 feet deep. Such a division would be reflected externally (fig. 425.D) and internally (figs. 425.B and E) in the location of the roof supporting uprights as well as their connecting tie beams. Our reconstruction of the Brewers' Granary as a cross wing is purely conjectural, based on the internal symmetry established by the great cross of the threshing floor: it appeared to call for a space based on the concept of a square rather than of two units of longitudinal axis. EAST ELEVATION AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION storing salted meats and other pickled staples; and likewise, of course, the barrels used in transportation. Their work required heat for the proper steaming and bending of the staves (fig. 423). The work of the tornarii, who occupy the other workshop in this building, must have been closely related to that of the tornatores in the Great Collective Workshop. The terms are interchangeable, both relating to the same skill, i.e., the manufacture of wooden tools or pieces of equipment that had to be fashioned on the turner's lathe. Because the floor space of the tornarii (27½ feet by 35 feet) is more than twice that allotted to the tornatores (12½ feet by 32½ feet)—and also because of its proximity to the house in which the draft animals are stabled—I would designate the [domus] tornariorum as the hall of the wheelwrights, whose craft, like that of their neighbors, the coopers, depends on special care and skill. They are the makers of the carts and wagons needed to haul in the harvest of grain and hay (fig. 424), to carry to the frozen fields fertilizing waste, and to bring in supplies obtained from the outlying estates. They are the makers of the ploughs and yokes, and whatever other wooden equipment is required in the harnessing of draft animals—the makers, also, when special conditions demand, of that proficient make of military transport, which the Capitulare de villis describes in such vivid terms: 425.F PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR COOPERS &amp; WHEELWRIGHTS &amp; BREWERS' GRANARY TRANSVERSE SECTION AND NORTH ELEVATION AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION The side or aisle rooms serving as bedrooms for the coopers and wheelwrights are juxtaposed lean-to fashion along the western long wall of the two workshops. Structural necessities dictate such a choice in this type of building; for a general analysis of the relation of outer to inner spaces see our remarks above, pp. 82-85ff. . . . war wagons, with canopies of hide so well sewn together that, if the necessity arises to float them across rivers, they will make the transit safely, with their entire load of flour, wine, shields, lances, bows, arrows, and quivers, no water ever seeping inside.25 25 I am paraphrasing a well-known passage in the Capitulare de villis, ch. 64, ed. cit., 58-59: Ut carra nostra quae in hostem pergunt basternae bene factae sint, et operculi bene sint cum coriis coperti, et ita sint consuti, ut, si necessitas evenerit aquas ad natandum, cum ipsa expensa quae intus fuerit transire flumina possint, ut nequaquam aqua intus intrare valeat et bene salva causa nostra, sicut diximus, transire possit. Et hoc volumus, ut farina in unoquoque carro ad spensam nostram missa fiat, hoc est duodecim modia de farina; et in quibus vinum ducant, modia XII ad nostrum modium mittant; et ad unumquodque carrum scutum et lanceam, cucurum et arcum habeant. Although the workshops of the coopers and wheelwrights are part of a long rectangular structure, which also includes the Brewers' Granary, they do not appear to be of identical design with the latter. The roof line of the workshops of the coopers and wheelwrights runs from south to north, in the center axis of these two workshops, to which the bedrooms are attached as subordinate entities in the west. The section that contains the Brewers' Granary, on the other hand, looks as though its ridge might have run from west to east, like the center portion of the House for Horses and Oxen. We reconstructed it in the manner shown in figure 425A-F. V. 12 HOUSE OF THE GARDENER &amp; THE MONKS' VEGETABLE GARDEN V.12.1 THE GARDENER'S RANK Since the monks lived primarily on a vegetable diet, the management of the monastic gardens was a responsibility of prime importance. The official in charge of this task was the Gardener (hortolanus), often not a monk but a layman. On the Plan of St. Gall he is provided with his own house. His high position in the monastic community is reflected by the fact that within this house he occupies an aisle all by himself, and, more significantly, that this part of the house is equipped with a corner fireplace, a privilege not accorded to any other person in the monastery's agricultural sector. The Gardener's House lies in the eastern tract of the monastery next to the Cemetery, at the head of the Monks' Vegetable Garden. Together with the latter it occupies a plot of land 125 feet long and 52½ feet wide. V.12.2 HOUSE OF THE GARDENER &amp; HIS CREW The House of the Gardener (fig. 426) measures 35 feet by 52½ feet. It consists of "the house itself" (ipsa domus), i.e., the common living room with its central fireplace1 1 With regard to the meaning of ipsa domus, see I, 77-78. Keller's interpretation (1844, 31; followed by Willis, 1848, 114; and Leclercq, in Cabrol-Leclercq, 1924, col. 104) of this room as a "Hof, in dessen Mitte sich ein kleines Gebäude, domus ipsa, befindet" rests on a misinterpretation of the term domus, and its mistaken identification with the fireplace instead of the room that surrounds the hearth. and three aisles attached to it, one to the east, one to the north, and one to the south. The west wall of the center room remains exposed and contains the principal entrance. The southern aisle of the house serves as "dwelling of the gardener" (mansio hortolani). The eastern aisle is divided into two rooms, which are designated as "sleeping quarters for the servants" (cubilia famulorum). They are separated from one another by a vestibule which gives access to the Garden. The northern aisle of the house is "a storage place for the garden tools and for the vegetable seeds" (hic ferram?ta reseruant' &amp; seminaria oler?). Abbot Adalhard in his manual on the economic management of the monastery of Corbie gives us an account of the kind of tools we may expect to find in this room; he also tells us by whom they are supplied and kept in repair: The gardener . . . ought to receive all iron tools from the chamberlain, who should supervise the smiths according to the custom of the community. If any of the tools should be broken, let the gardener show them to the chamberlain and let him have them repaired or give out another metal appliance and take in the broken one. Furthermore, those tools must then be repaired by the chamberlain in whatever way may be necessary. And for cultivating the field or for carrying out any other needs, let each one have six hoes [fussorios], two spades [bessos], three straight axes [secures], an adze [dolatorium], two augers [taratra] large and small, one chisel [scalprum], one gulbium (unidentifiable), two sickles [falcilia], one scythe [falcem], two trunci (possibly "handles" for axes and scythes), one coulter [cultrum], one scerum (possibly "shears"), and other instruments kept in the chamberlain's office, as winnowing fans [uanni], casting shovels [banstae], or other things of this sort. In our reconstruction of the Gardener's House (fig. 427, A-F) we have kept the roof line of the peripheral spaces on the same level, which leaves the upper parts of the walls on the two narrow sides of the center space exposed as timber framed gables. Another alternative would have been to lead the rafters on the two narrow sides of the house up to a cross piece near the ridge of the main roof, as we have done in all of the larger guest and service buildings where hipped roofs have clear constructional advantages. In small houses, such as the Gardener's House, the solution here suggested might have been the simpler one, provided that the rafters of the main roof were protected against longitudinal displacement by some secondary provision, such as a center purlin framed into collar pieces. This is a very common stabilizing device in English roof construction of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries (a typical example is St. Mary's Hospital in Chichester, above fig. 342). Whether we can expect it to have been used on the continent in Carolingian times is another question. V.12.3 THE MONKS' VEGETABLE GARDEN The Monks' Vegetable Garden (HORTUS) lies to the east of the Gardener's House and to the south of the shadowing fruit trees of the Cemetery (fig. 426). It covers a rectangular plot of land 52½ feet wide and 82½ feet long, and is entirely surrounded by a wall or a fence, having a single entrance at the side which faces the Gardener's House. Internally the garden is divided into two rows of planting beds separated from one another by a central path that carries the inscription "Here the planted vegetables flourish in beauty" (Hic plantata holerum pulchre nascentia uernant"). There are nine planting beds in each row. They are separated from one another by eight crosswalks, and from the surrounding wall or fence, by a continuous peripheral walk, all of the same width. We have to imagine the planting surface of these beds as being raised above the level of the walks and framed in by planks held in place by stakes. This is suggested by a passage in Walahfrid Strabo's Hortulus3 3 Cf. above p. 181. Walahfrid (Hortulus, ed. Dümmler, in Mon. Germ. Hist., Poetae Latini Aevi Carolini, II, 1884, 337, vss. 46-49; ed. Näf and Gabathuler, 1957, vss. 46-49) tells us how he protects the planting beds in his garden in this manner: as well as a variety of paintings and drawings of medieval gardens, such as the famous hortus conclusus (Paradiesgärtlein) in the Städelsches Kunstinstitut of Frankfurt, painted around 1410 by an unknown Rhenish master;4 4 Reproduced in color as frontispiece in Behling, 1957. the charming illustrations of the labors of the month of April in the Heures de Turin (fig. 428), or the illumination of a garden with clipped trees in the Grimani Breviary (fig. 429).5 5 For the Heures de Turin, see Durrieu, 1902, Pl. IV. For the Grimani Breviary, fol. 613, see Morpurgo and de Vries, I, 1903-8, pl. 1165. Another fine example is the illumination of the month of March in the Breviary of the Musée Mayer van den Bergh at Antwerp, fol. 2v (see Gaspar, 1932, pl. III). 2 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 4, ed. Semmler, in Corp. Cons. Mon., I, 1963, 381. For difficult and unexplainable terms, see translation and annotations to this passage, III, 108f and notes 76-82. 426. PLAN 426.X PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE OF THE GARDENER AND HIS CREW AND MONKS' VEGETABLE GARDEN The position of the Monks' Vegetable Garden between the Orchard (y) and the poultry runs (21, 23) as well as its proximity to the Monks' Latrine (4) demonstrates the awareness for functional inter-relationships characterizing the intelligence of those who designed the Plan. Both Orchard and Garden come under the care of the Gardener. The Garden would have drawn the most effective fertilizer from the nitrogen-rich droppings of the nearby fowl yards; grain feed for chickens and geese (the Granary is in close proximity) could be augmented by trimmings from the vegetables. However, the most important source for fertilizer might have been the Monks' Privy, if the waste there was not swept away through water channels but (as seems more reasonable to assume) was gathered in settling tanks. The garden plots were devoted largely to what we today consider to be seasonings or spices; with root crops in need of more space than that available within the monastic compound, and therefore grown on land outside the walls, the produce of the garden could be largely devoted to crops for enhancing the flavors of the monks' heavily vegetarian diet. Each bed of the Monks' Vegetable Garden is used for the cultivation of a specific type of plant, the name of which is entered by the hand of the second scribe in the pale ink that characterizes his writing.6 6 Cf. I, 13ff. Read from top to bottom in the sequence in which they were written they are: SOUTHERN ROW 1. cepas onion (allium cepas L.)7 7 The modern Latin plant names listed in parentheses are taken from Wolfgang Sörrensen's article on the gardens and plants of the Plan. To Sörrensen we owe much other vital information on this subject; see Sörrensen in Studien, 1962. 2. porros leek (allium porrum L.) 3. apium celery (apium graveolens L.) 4. coliandrum coriander (coriandrum sativum L.) 5. an&amp;um dill (anetum graveolens L.) 6. papaver poppy (papaver somniferum L.) 7. radices radish (raphanus sativus L.) 8. magones poppy8 8 The fact that poppy appears twice is bewildering. Sörrensen (ibid., 210-11) feels certain that magones is poppy, but which variety of poppy remains uncertain. (papaver . . . L.) 9. betas chard (beta vulgaris or beta cicla L.) NORTHERN ROW 10. alias garlic (allium sativum L.) 11. ascolonias shallot (allium ascolonicum L.) 12. p&amp;rosilium parsley (apium petrosilium L.) 13. cerefolium chervil (anthriscus cerefolium Hofmann) 14. lactuca lettuce (lactuca scariola L.) 15. sataregia pepperwort (satureia hortensis L.) 16. pastinchus parsnip (pastinaca sativa L.) 17. caulas cabbage (brassica oleracea L.) 18. gitto fennel (nigella satira L.) Inde Nothi conquitur flabris solisque calore Areola et lignis ne diffluat obsita quadris Altius a plano modicum resupina levatur. Then the garden patch is baked with the gust of the South wind and the heat of the sun, and the flat-planted bed, lest it slide away, is raised a little higher than the flat ground with wooden squares. PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE OF THE GARDENER AND HIS CREW 427.C WEST ELEVATION The entrance, located in the middle of the western long wall, leads directly into the common living room. The northern lean-to with corner fireplace serves as the Gardener's private dwelling. 427.B LONGITUDINAL SECTION The door in the center leads from the common living room into a vestibule which gives access to the servants' quarters and has an exit to the Garden. 427.A GROUND PLAN Since the Gardener's private room had a corner fireplace, it was independent of the communal fireplace in the living room and could have been separated from the rest of the house by wall partitions as well as by a ceiling. If provided with a ceiling it would have needed windows in the outer wall for light and air. AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION 427.F NORTH ELEVATION The Gardener's private dwelling is a lean-to attached to the northern end of the communal living room. Whether its roof ended on the level here shown or reached up to the ridge in the form of a hip, is impossible to ascertain. 427.E SOUTH ELEVATION The southern lean-to serves as tool shed. It received its light and warmth (if any) from the fireplace and louver in the communal living room. 427.D TRANSVERSE SECTION The door to the left connects the living room with the Gardener's private dwelling. The door to the right leads from a vestibule, located in the middle of the eastern aisle of the house into one of the two bedrooms of the servants. The layout of the Gardener's House is identical with that of the House for Cows and Cowherds (fig. 438) and the House for Foaling Mares and their Keepers. (fig. 487). In all of these the common living room with the traditional open fireplace is surrounded with subsidiary outer spaces on three sides only. The entrance is in the middle of the wall that lacks an aisle. The House of the Physicians (fig. 410) belongs to the same family of structures. 428. HEURES DE TURIN (CA. 1390). LABORS OF THE MONTH OF APRIL (FORMERLY) TURIN, BIBLIOTECA NAZIONALE, MS. K. IV. 29, FOL. 4, DETAIL [after Durrieu, 1902, pl. IV] The scene showing the seeding of staked and raised garden beds is one of twelve calendar pictures forming part of a manuscript begun at the end of the fourteenth century for the Duc de Berry, but never finished. Before 1413 the manuscript was held by Robinet d'Estampes, keeper of de Berry's jewels. Other parts of the same manuscript are in the Museo Civico of Turin, and the Bibliotheque Nationale and the Louvre, Paris. The fragment shown above perished in a fire that destroyed the whole library in 1904; fortunately, Durrieu had published it two years earlier. Sörrensen points out that most of these plants, although not native to the north, are still today the main stock of a well-planned vegetable garden.9 9 Ibid., 203-4. Their choice discloses that this garden was primarily a kitchen garden. It does not include such crops as beans, lentils, beets, carrots, and the bulkier cabbage varieties whose cultivation required larger plots. These heavier crops must have been raised in the outlying fields. In a monastery like the one represented on the Plan of St. Gall, around 250 men had to be fed each day.10 10 Cf. I, 342. The Abbey of Corbie, which had to feed over 400 persons daily, maintained four gardens outside the monastery walls under the direction of four gardeners (hortolani) who were assisted by eight prebends (prouendarii) and a large number of workmen from the neighboring villae whose exclusive task it was, between April 15 and October 15, to hoe and weed the land as well as to repair its huts and fences.11 11 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 4, ed. Semmler, in Corp. Cons. Mon., I, 1963, 380-82; and translation, III, 108-109. This and the fact that each gardener had at his disposal an ox and a plow suggests that the gardens outside were large.12 12 Verhulst-Semmler, 1962, 116-17; and Lesne, VI, 1943, 302. For further information on outlying gardens, see Bikel, 1914, 97ff. In addition to the crops harvested from the gardens and fields managed by the monks themselves, there were those which the monastery received as tithes from its leased possessions. Accounts of the Abbey of St. Gall tell us of deliveries of beans from its lands at Gossau, Geberardiswiller, Arnegg, Tiefenbach, and Opferdingen, as well as of large shipments of leek, such as the "thirty loads of leek" (XXX pondera porri) which were annually transported to St. Gall from Hohenweiler in the Voralberg or Scheidegg in Bavaria.13 13 For the sources cf. ibid., 98 note 3. Lastly, the local produce was enriched by staples imported from the south, such as olives, lemons, dates, raisins, pomegranates, and chestnuts. Most of these latter goods the Abbey of St. Gall imported from the monastery of Bobbio in Lombardy, with which it entertained a lively trade.14 14 Ibid. GRIMANI BREVIARY (CA. 1490). GARDEN WITH TOPIARY TREES 429. This masterpiece of illumination, of uncertain authorship, provenance, and date, was made at the period of transition between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The style of the manuscript, in which many masters collaborated (the majority Flemish, a few perhaps French), suggests a date between 1490 and 1510, probably nearer the latter according to David Diringer (The Illuminated Book; New York-Washington, rev. ed. 1967, p. 455). The manuscript, one of the largest in existence, is composed of 832 leaves measuring 22 × 28 cm. It was published in a facsimile edition of thirteen volumes (ed. Scato de Vries) in 1903-1908. VENICE, BIBLIOTECA DI SAN MARCO. FOL. 613 [after Morpurgo and de Vries, I, 1903-1908, pl. 1165] A typical late medieval "Ziergarten" (decorative pleasure garden) shows planting beds raised by means of staked boards above the level of the walks, as in Walahfrid Strabo's garden (above, p. 183). The beds are laid out in two rows and are framed by a peripheral row of bordering beds, as in the Medicinal Herb Garden (figs. 414-415). PLAN OF ST. GALL. MONKS' CEMETERY AND ORCHARD 430. The cemetery contains thirteen planting areas for trees and fourteen (= twice seven) burial plots. Seven of them lie to the east of the great cross in the center, and seven of them at and below it. It is probably not an accidental arrangement but rather one of the countless examples of preoccupation of the drafters of the Plan with sacred numbers. Thirteen evokes the memory of Christ and the twelve Apostles and in particular their congregation at the supper that preceded His death. (The tendril-shaped symbol used to locate the trees of the orchard is a key to identifying the designer of the original Plan; see I, 27ff). The number seven, Augustus writes, expressed "the wholeness and completeness of all created things" (cf. I, 118ff, and Horn, 1975, 351-90). The modular scheme of the Plan applies to the burial plots: their width, 6¼ feet, is composed of two standard 2½-foot modules plus one 1¼- foot submodule, while their length, at 17½ feet, reflects once again the sacred number seven: 7 × 2½ = 17½. Thus, in each plot the bodies of seven brothers could be accommodated, in keeping with the application of standard modules to achieve the human scale of the other facilities of the Plan. And as elsewhere, this compounding and multiplication of sevens can hardly be fortuitous, but on the contrary, quite purposeful in the planning of the Cemetery. V. 13 THE CEMETERY AND ORCHARD To the side of the Novitiate, the home of the incoming monks, and in convenient proximity to the Infirmary and the House of the Physicians, is the monastery's burial ground. It is a large field 80 feet wide and 125 feet long, enclosed by walls or hedges, with only a single entrance to the west facing the monks' cloister (fig. 430). The grounds of the Cemetery served, in addition, as an orchard, and this dual role of giving rest to the dead under the shadow of the Cross as well as furnishing the living with delectable fruit is poetically expressed in a distich, inscribed into a large square enclosure in the center of the cemetery, which designates the location of a monumental cross: Inter ligna soli haec semp&amp;#x0336; s?cissima crux ÷ In qua p&amp;#x0336;p&amp;#x0336; &amp; uae poma salutis olent Among the trees of the soil, always the most sacred is the Cross On which the fruits of eternal health are fragrant V.13.1 THE CEMETERY There are fourteen burial plots, each 6¼ feet wide and 17½ feet long.1 1 Some of the burial plots appear to be only 5 feet wide (two standard units), others are decidedly wider, yet not quite as broad as to be interpreted as 7½ feet (three standard units). This leads me to believe that what the draftsman had in mind was a width of 6¼ feet (two standard modules of 2½ feet and one submodule of 1¼ feet). For other uses of the submodule see I, 59. They are identified by the distich: Hanc circum iaceant defunta cadauera fr?m? Qua radiante Iterum. Regna poli accipant' Around this [cross] let rest the dead bodies of the brethren And through its radiance they may attain again the realm of heaven The death and burial of a monk was a matter of intense concern to the entire community, as may be inferred from the moving descriptions of the last hours of the monks Wolo, Ratpert and Gerald in Ekkehart's IV Casus sancti Galli or the latter's poetic account of the death of his teacher Notker Labeo in his Liber Benedictionum.2 2 All brought to my attention by Johannes Duft. For Wolo, Ratpert and Gerald see Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, chaps. 43, 44, and 125; ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 152-55, 155-58, 405-8; ed. Helbling, 1958, 89-91, 91-93, 208-10. For Notker Labeo see Der Liber Benedictionum Ekkeharts IV., chap. 44, ed. Egli, 1909, 231-34. An English consuetudinary of the end of the tenth century, the Regularis concordia of St. Dunstan, describes the share which the community had in the death of one of its brothers as follows: When the sick brother feels his strength ebbing, he makes this known to the convent through the master of the infirmary. Whereupon the priest who celebrates the morning mass, accompanied by his attendants, will administer the holy eucharist. Preceded by monks carrying candles and incense, the entire congregation visits the sick, chanting the penitential psalms, the litanies of the saints, and the prescribed orations. Then the sick receives his last unction, yet only on the first day; thereafter he receives the communion. If he recovers his strength the daily visits stop. If his condition does not improve, the visits are continued to the end. When the patient [begins] his death struggle, the sounding board is rung so that all can come together to be at his side in this extreme moment. Immediately the prayers of the commendation of the soul are said, the Subvenite, sancti Domini and the sequence prescribed by the Ordo commendationis. Upon expiration those who are in charge of this task will wash the body and wrap it into its proper clothing, i.e., his shirt, his cowl, his gaiters, and his shoes, whatever is customary in the order to which the deceased belongs. If he be a priest, in addition, the stole will be placed upon his cowl, if this seems appropriate. This being done, the body is carried into the Church to the chant of the psalms and the ringing of the bells. If death comes at night before dawn or matin and there is time for all the preparations necessary for burial, he will be placed into his grave that same day, after the celebration of mass and before the brothers take their meal. Otherwise, brothers will be designated to watch in groups over the body during this day and the night which follows. Psalms will be sung without interruption until the body is rendered to the earth. After the burial the brothers return to the Church, chanting the seven penitential psalms for the deceased. They complete the psalms lying prostrate before the holy altar.3 3 Sancti Dunstani Regularis Concordia, ed. Migne, Patr. Lat., CXXX-VII, 1879, cols. 500-1. The event is described in even greater detail in the Monastic Constitutions of Lanfranc, see Decreta Lanfranci, ed. Knowles, 1951, 121-31. Other descriptions of deaths in the monastery, as Charles W. Jones points out to me, are found in Bede's Historia Abbatum and Ecclesiastical History, viz. the deaths of Benedict Biscop and Sigfrid (Historia Abbatum, chaps. 11-13, ed. Plummer, Historia Ecclesiastica, I, 1896, 374-76); the death of the poet Caedmon (Hist. Eccl., book IV, chap. 22, ed. cit., 26162; ed. Colgrave and Mynors, 1969, 414-21); the death of St. Cuthbert (Bede's Prose Life of St. Cuthbert, chap. 39, ed. Colgrave, 1940, 283-85). Bede's own death is described in a letter by his pupil Cuthbert, who in the second half of the eighth century was abbot of Jarrow and Monkwearmouth (published in Plummer's introduction to Bede's Historia Ecclesiastica, I, 1896, cix-clxiv; ed. Colgrave and Mynors, 1969, 577-87). V.13.2 THE ORCHARD The spaces between the burial plots are planted with fruit trees. Their location is indicated by thirteen tree-symbols which, save for the thickness of their stems, resemble tendrils rather than trees. The fact that one of them is associated with the names of two different species (sorbarius and mispolarius) suggests that in each case there was meant to be a group of plants rather than an individual specimen. This is also suggested by the largeness of the space for planting left between the burial plots, which in some cases amounts to as much as 12½ feet by 40 feet. The names of the trees have been tampered with by the same hand that tried to revive the erased titles of the large anonymous building in the northwest corner of the monastery.4 4 Cf. above, p. 166. As there, the chemical substance used in this attempt has left thick blue streaks in the parchment. This action damaged, but did not destroy, the names of the trees. Listed in the sequence in which they were written by the scribe, from top to bottom, and in columns, moving from left to right, they are: 1. mal[arius] apple (malus communis L.) 2. perarius pear (pirus communis L.) 3. prunarius plum (prunus domestica L.) 4. sorbarius service tree (sorbus domestica L.) 5. mispolarius medlar (mespilus germanica L.) 6. laurus laurel (laurus nobilis L.) 7. castenarius chestnut (fagus castanea L.) 8. ficus fig (ficus carica L.) 9. guduniarius quince (cydonia vulgaris L.) 10. persicus peach (prunus persica L.) 11. auellenarius hazelnut (corylus tubulosa L.) 12. amendelarius almond (amygdalis communis L.) 13. murarius mulberry (morus nigra L.) 14. nugarius walnut (juglans regia L.)5 5 The Latin titles given in parenthesis are the modern botanical names after Sörrensen, in Studien 1962, 244-53. Of the fourteen listed species the apple, the pear, the plum, the quince, and the peach are fruit trees in the proper sense of the term; the others—the medlar, the chestnut, the hazelnut, the mulberry, the walnut, the almond, and the service tree—in the broader sense. Two of the trees listed, the fig and the laurel, are not suited to a northern climate. All of these fourteen trees are also listed in the repertory of plants which the Capitulare de villis prescribes as mandatory for the gardens in the king's estates. The inclusion in this manual for the management of crown estates of a considerable number of plants and trees that require a Mediterranean climate had formerly led to the belief that it was issued for the kingdom of Aquitaine.6 6 Capitulare de Villis, chap. 70, ed. Gareis, 1895, 60ff. Recently this attribution has been questioned,7 7 Dopsch, 2nd ed., I, 1921, 93ff; and von Wartburg, 1940, 87-91. and the entire problem of the presence on the Plan of St. Gall, as well as in the Capitulare de villis and other Carolingian sources, of plants not suited for a northern climate is now being interpreted as an expression of literary classicism.8 8 Metz, 1960, 41 and 36ff., where the reader will find a systematic tabulation of plants and trees listed in the above-mentioned Carolingian documents, including the Plan of St. Gall as well as a number of Old High German and Greco-Roman glossaries. The yield of the fruit trees in the Cemetery could not have met all the needs of a community of an estimated 250 to 270 mouths. The monastery has a special house for the drying of fruit (locus ad torrendas annonas), where staples were produced which enabled the Kitchener to bridge the dietary shortages in the critical winter months when the fields and gardens were barren. The bulk of the fruit, however, that was needed for that purpose must have come from outlying orchards, managed either by the abbey itself or by tenants. The business accounts of the monastery of St. Gall tell us of the deliveries of nuts from Rorschach, of apples from a place called Bachwille, and from an orchard maintained at a place called Muolen. The contribution made to European horticulture by skills practiced by monks in the growth and propagation of fruit trees cannot be overestimated. The number of indigenous fruit trees north of the Alps was limited, and the native fruit too small and too bitter to be eaten raw. They could be used for the preparation of fermented beverages (in Old and Middle High German sources we read of epfildrac [cider] and slehendrac [an alcoholic beverage made of sloe]),9 9 For the sources, see Bikel, 1914, 98 note 2. but for fruit to be served at the table the indigenous trees had to be improved through selective breeding and grafting. The knowledge of this art was acquired by the inhabitants of transalpine Europe from the Romans; it spread from Gaul along the Moselle into the Rhine valley.10 10 Cf. Heyne, II, 1901, 353-54. The monasteries adopted this legacy and applied it on a large scale. The orchards of the abbey became the model for the orchards and gardens of their secular tenants; and from them the knowledge spread to the tenants of the secular lords. * 430.X ROME. CHURCH OF ST. JOHN LATERAN, SANCTA SANCTORUM CHAPEL ENAMELLED RELIQUARY CROSS, 817-824 [courtesy of the Museo Sacro Vaticano] The arms of the reliquary cross taper toward their intersection and show the concave extremities typical of Carolingian crosses. The arms of the large cross in the Monks' Cemetery are drawn to show concave extremities. Given the evidence in coins and architectural carving, one cannot conclude that the arms of the Cemetery cross owe their shape only to drafting mannerisms. The registers of the St. John Lateran reliquary cross are, top to bottom: Annunciation, Visitation, Navity, Presentation, Baptism; on the horizontal arms: Adoration and Transfiguration (?) Drawn from silver coins: I, II, IV, V, struck 794-805; III, 768-72; VI: Cross carved in stone closure slab (Musée Centrale, Metz, late 8th cent.) Vertical and horizontal arms of the typical Carolingian cross taper slightly from the outer ends to their intersection. The thick, stocky design of IV, less usual, has a pronounced concavity at the extremities. The stone cross, VI, of pronounced taper, has flat extremities. A common type in architectural carving, it was much in vogue in Visigothic Spain. The sculptured stone prevails over the cross with parallel sides. PLAN OF ST. GALL. GRANARY 431. FOR AUTHORS' RECONSTRUCTION SEE PP. 220, 221 In this barn, with its floor area of almost 4,300 square feet, the drafters of the Plan allowed for the storage and threshing of the entire annual harvest of grain from the monastery's local fields (but not including any grain threshed elsewhere on outlying estates and then delivered sacked directly to the miller). The needs of the community for grain for both men and beasts would have been prodigious. The Granary was not intented as a multiple-use building; the size of the harvest and the need to store its by-product—straw for animal stalls and for mulching— would preclude any combined utility. All the sheaved grain would have to be stored indoors before the onset of the first autumn rains. The work of threshing would no doubt have continued long into the winter. Threshing, in most medieval barns, was performed in the center or wagon bay at one end of which was the entrance to the barn, as here. The lateral extension of the threshing floor of the Granary of the Plan into its cruciform shape would have allowed as many as six men to thresh simultaneously—four in the wagon bay and one in each segment of the lateral arms, allowing a space approximately 12 feet square for each man and his flail. (If the Luttrell Psalter illustrates typical practice, fig. 437, the number of threshers could have been twelve, two per area.) The task was among the most arduous and labor-intensive that the largely nonmechanized society could require to be done. Except for its great cruciform threshing floor and the single entrance designated in the western long wall, structural details of the Granary are entirely lacking. To have drawn them in would have been redundant, and possibly confusing. The drafters of the Plan, concerned with providing enough space for the tasks of the harvest and the needs of the community, and locating the facility appropriately on the site, would have left the details of the barn's posting and internal division to be planned and executed under the direction of a master carpenter. Every able-bodied man in the empire would have known that such a barn must be an aisled and timbered structure with its roof supported by two inner rows of freestanding posts: so barns had been from time out of mind. 431.X The smaller of the two granaries, serving only the Brewery, has little floor space beyond that required for transitory storage of sheaved or sacked grain. Any straw from threshing could be taken immediately to the animal barns at the west; threshed grain could be moved directly to the Mortar and thence to the brewing ranges. There is no direct path internal to the Plan between animal barns, Mills and Mortars, and the great threshing barn to the east. One must assume that on an actual site, a gate giving direct access from the fields without to the Granary would have been provided. V. 14 FACILITIES FOR STORAGE AND THRESHING OF GRAIN V.14.1 THE MAIN GRANARY Between the Great Collective Workshop and the Gardener's House is a large Granary (fig. 431) for storing the annual harvest and threshing the grain: Frugibus hic instat cunctis labor excutiendis Here is pursued the labor of threshing the entire harvest The draftsman takes great care to define the two complementary functions of this building: the first, with an inscription, "barn, i.e., storehouse for the annual harvest of grain" (horreum um repositio fructuü annali?);1 1 The symbol ·?· must be interpreted as id est; see Battelli, 1949, 114, and Cappelli, 1954, xxxiii, and 168. The symbol was mistakenly read as vel by Willis, 1848, 112; Stephani, II, 1903, 52; Leclercq, in Cabrol-Leclercq, 1924, col. 104; and Reinhardt, 1952, 14. Keller, 1844, 3, failed to list this line. the second, by designating a cross-shaped area of ground as "the area where grain and chaff are threshed" (area in qua triturant' grana et paleae). The Granary is 47½ feet wide and 90 feet long. Its axis runs from south to north. The building has only one entrance, in the middle of its western long wall; it is a double-winged door wide enough to allow the loaded wagons to enter. It is not likely that a barn of these dimensions would have been covered by a single span in the ninth century. Even in the great monastic barns of the thirteenth century the roof was carried by two rows of freestanding inner posts when the width of the barn exceeded 25 feet. The draftsman must have taken these constructional features for granted. Had the Granary been intended to shelter human beings or animals as well, the floor plan would have indicated the wall partitions separating the spaces used for storing the harvest from the spaces reserved for people or animals; and the course of these partitions would, in turn, have given us a clue to the location of the roof-supporting posts. But the barn of the Plan of St. Gall had no such secondary function, except that a certain amount of its floor space had to be kept vacant for threshing. The draftsman makes this clear by carefully delineating the surface area needed for this purpose: two threshing lanes intersecting each other at right angles, each lane about 12 feet wide, i.e., the distance two rows of men would require when flailing grain from opposite sides. The layout of the Granary of the Plan of St. Gall teaches us that broadside access must have been a very common feature, if not the standard form, in Carolingian barn construction. It was and remained throughout the entire 432. LUTTRELL PSALTER (1340). LONDON, BRITISH MUSEUM, ADD. MS. 42130, fol. 173 [By courtesy of the Trustees of the British Museum] Three men stack bound sheaves of grain while two others carry sheaves to the pile. The work of cutting and sheaving grain is arduous; it must be cut when the kernels are still in the barb and sufficiently moist so that the grain heads will not shatter and spill the harvest to the ground. At this point the grain stalks are technically "green", and too tough to scythe, but must be hand cut with sickles. Middle Ages the traditional form of monastic and secular English barn construction. In medieval France and in the medieval and post-medieval dwelling barns of Lower Saxony the entrances were invariably in the gable walls. In the Lowlands and in southern Germany—as a glance at the engravings of Pieter Bruegel the Elder or the watercolors of Albrecht Dürer (figs. 335; 336) show—the two types are mixed. A typical English parallel comparable in size to the Granary of the Plan of St. Gall is the priory barn of Little Wymondley, Hertfordshire (fig. 434A-C)2 2 The barn of Little Wymondley belonged to Wymondley Priory, which was founded during the reign of Henry II by Richard de Argentein, lord of the manor of Great Wymondley, sometime before 1218. See Victoria History of the Counties of England, Hertfordshire, III, 1912, 190. It lies immediately to the south of the Priory House and, in all probability, is the original Priory Barn. Cf. Horn, 1963, 18ff. (Radiocarbon measurements taken since these lines were written suggest that the present barn dates from the fifteenth century and that it incorporates in its extant frame of timbers a few reused beams of the original barn. Cf. UCLA Radiocarbon Dates, VI, 485 (UCLA—1057 and 1058) and Berger, 1970, 132-33. , probably dating from the first half of the thirteenth century. Other examples of the same period, both English and Continental, were discussed above on pp. 103ff. The earliest evidence, other than the Plan of St. Gall, for monastic barns with broadside entrances are the barns that the Dean and Chapter of the cathedral of St. Paul's in London maintained on its outlying estates in the counties of Hertfordshire, Essex, Middlesex, and Surrey. They are described in lease agreements dating from 1114 to 1155.3 3 Hale, 1858, 122-39. For further details on these barns, most of which are described with such accuracy that they can be reconstructed on the drawing board, see Horn, 1958, 11ff.; and Horn and Born, 1965, 11ff. A careful reading of these texts makes it clear that traditionally the harvest was stored in this type of barn by filling the bays closest to the gable walls first and working from there toward the center of the building, the center bay being left empty for the entry and exit of the wagons. This center bay was thus the natural place for threshing. In many of the surviving English medieval barns these entrance bays are paved, either in stone or with wooden planks, and were used for threshing until the invention of modern harvesting machinery4 4 A notable example is the great tithe barn of Harmondsworth in Middlesex, England; see Hartshorne, 1875, 416ff.; Royal Commission on Historical Monuments, Middlesex, 1937, 61-62; Horn, 1958, 14; and Horn, 1970, pp. 43-46. eliminated the need for any such provisions (cf. fig. 437). 433. LUTTRELL PSALTER (1340). LONDON, BRITISH MUSEUM, ADD. MS. 42130, fol. 173v [By courtesy of the Trustees of the British Museum] In moderate climates, sheaved grain may be stored in the field for a few days to many weeks. Sheaves are stacked upright and over them, a few sheaves are splayed with grainheads down, to form a protective thatching that sheds occasional rain. In northern climates the sheaves had to be under shelter long before the onset of autumn rains; hence the great size of the Plan's threshing barn. The cart of the Psalter, with three horses and three men, does not exaggerate the weight of the sheaves nor the labor required to load them. Our reconstruction of the Granary of the Plan (fig. 435AE) is not modeled after any particular example. We have chosen a type that might have been found anywhere at any time during the Middle Ages. We have given it a roof with rafters of uniform scantling and hipped bays at the end, because of the restraining effect such lean-to's exert on any tendency of such a roof to give way under longitudinal stresses. We could also have reconstructed it as a purlin roof, analogous to Little Wymondley, except for the curved arch and wind braces of this building which are typically English and have no parallels on the Continent. 434.C LITTLE WYMONDLEY, HERTFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND. PRIORY BARN FIRST HALF OF THE 15TH CENTURY EXTERIOR VIEW FROM THE SOUTHWEST A classical example of a medieval monastic barn of England, its purlin roof is hipped over the terminal bays; two transeptal porches give access to the center bay. The barn does not, as we formerly believed, date to the 13th century when the priory was founded, but was rebuilt in the 15th century on the site of an earlier building; some beams from previous structure were reused to make this one. Had the Granary of the Plan been built, it would have resembled this one in many details. LITTLE WYMONDLEY, HERTFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND. PRIORY BARN 434.B 434.A GROUND PLAN AND LONGITUDINAL SECTION SCALE INCH EQUALS ONE FOOT [1:192] At 100 feet long and 38 feet wide, Little Wymondley is only 9 feet narrower, and 10 feet longer, than the Granary of the Plan. Eight roof trusses divide it into a nave, 23 feet wide, and two aisles, 7½ feet wide. The nine bays are 11 feet deep except for the wagon bay at 12 feet, which serves as entrance and as threshing floor after the harvest is in. The trusses supporting the roof are connected lengthwise by roof plates tenoned into the principal posts immediately below the tie beams; and in the roof slopes by two tiers of purlins. The trusses are locked longitudinally by arched braces into principal posts and at the level of the purlins. PLAN AND LONGITUDINAL SECTION SCALE INCH EQUALS ONE FOOT [1:192] GRAPHIC SCALE, 408.D, PAGE 172 FOR COLOR PLAN SEE P. 214 435.B 435.A In all major medieval barns the center aisle was considerably broader than the outer aisles by at least twice as much; but they rarely exceeded a width of 21-23 feet. The depth of the bays ranged in general between 11 and 13 feet. Barns the size of Great Coxwell (figs. 349-351) and Parçay-Meslay (figs. 352-355) are exceptions; because of their unusual size they depended on heavy masonry walls and gables. A building 90 feet long would most probably be comprised of seven bays each 13 feet deep. We have assigned to the Granary nave a width of 22½ feet and to each aisle, 12½ feet. The short arm of the paved threshing floor is edged, in the nave, by unpaved areas ca. 5½ feet wide where men might stand while threshing. PLAN OF ST. GALL. GRANARY. AUTHORS' RECONSTRUCTION 435.C 435.D 435.E TRANSVERSE SECTION, SOUTH ELEVATION AND WEST ELEVATION Enough is known about the history and protohistory of the medieval barn to allow a safe assumption that a building 47½ feet wide and 90 feet long would have been an aisled structure. But there is no reason to assume that any part would have been of masonry except for the foundations and a shallow plinth on which to foot the upright timbers and protect them from dampness. In the majority of medieval and prehistoric buildings of this type the roof was hipped over the terminal bays (compare prehistoric examples, figs. 295-97, 313-14, and medieval barns and houses portrayed by Dürer, fig. 335, and by Bruegel, fig. 336). 436. PLAN OF ST. GALL. BREWERS' GRANARY The location of the Brewers' Granary (30) next to the Monks' Bake and Brewhouse (9), the Mortar (28) and Drying Kiln (29), and its proximity to the Bake and Brewhouse of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers (32) is ideal, since the work performed in all of these installations represents separate and successive stages in the making of beer: threshing, crushing, parching and brewing. If the threshing floor of the Brewers' Granary seems disproportionately large, it may owe to the fact that much less grain needed to be stored there for any length of time, although the work of threshing for brewing no doubt was continuous (cf. fig. 431. X). The Granary of the Plan of St. Gall was the storage place, I should imagine, not only for the harvest yielded by the fields that the monastery worked with the aid of its own serfs, but also for the revenues obtained through the tithing of land leased out to tenants.5 5 The practice of tithing, i.e., of drawing in a tenth of the produce of the land the monastery owned as well as tenth of all the animals raised on this land, was begun by Pepin III and appears to have been his means of giving some compensation to the Church for the economic losses they had suffered before his time under the Merovingians; cf. Ganshof, 1960, 109; and Stutz, 1908. The volume of the annual revenues derived from any of these sources was a carefully regulated matter. Abbot Adalhard of Corbie, who had to take care of a monastic community of an average of 300 souls, furnished a detailed account of the manner in which the supply of grain was handled in his own monastery. The total income in grain "well winnowed and husked" (spelta bene uentilata et mundata) was 750 baskets per year (two baskets per day plus 20 additional baskets for safety).6 6 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 3, ed. Semmler, in Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 375; and translation, III, 106. Abbot Adalhard informs us that two baskets average ten modii, each modius yielding 30 loaves of bread; two baskets thus giving assurance of 300 loaves per day. He establishes how many sheaves make up a modius of grain, allowing for the variation in quality of grain obtained from different fields, and he draws attention to the detrimental effect of such variance on the attempt to attain an accurate system of measurement. He points out that the straw ought always to be delivered with the grain, as it, too, has uses, and he rules that when places are too far away for the tithe to be carted in, the villages lying near should pay double tithes and then collect from their neighbors farther out. In conclusion, he admonished the Porter, who is in charge of all these operations, to keep an accurate inventory of all these deliveries.7 7 Ibid., 390. V.14.2 THE BREWERS' GRANARY The Monks' Brewery has its own granary with bins for the storage of grain and other ingredients used in brewing. This facility is attached to the south end of the House of the Coopers and Wheelwrights and lies directly between the Monks' Bake and Brew House and the buildings that contain the machinery indispensable in the process of brewing, the Drying Kiln and the Mortar. The Brewers' Granary is a square, 32½ feet by 35 feet, internally divided into a cross-shaped floor, which leaves four storage bins in the corners (fig. 436). The purpose of the building is explained by the following title: granarium ubi mandatu frumentum seru &amp; ur &amp; q? ad ceruis? praeparatur8 8 The nasal bar over the terminal u of the word mandatu(m) is omitted. The word was correctly interpreted as "gereinigt" by Reinhard, 1952, 15. The earlier students of the Plan paraphrased the passage rather than translating it. Cf. Keller, 1844, 31; Willis, 1848, 112; Leclercq, 1924, col. 103. The granary where the cleansed grain is kept and [where] what goes to make beer is prepared The title implies that the grain used for brewing was subjected to special cleaning and husking practices, which is also suggested by the above-quoted passage from the Statutes of Adalhard of Corbie, where it is stipulated that the grain should be delivered to the monastery "well winnowed and husked." The other ingredients referred 437. LUTTRELL PSALTER (1340). LONDON, BRITISH MUSEUM, ADD. MS. 42130, fol. 74v [By courtesy of the Trustees of the British Museum] Two men with flails thresh sheaved grain. Throughout the Middle Ages and into modern times the work of harvesting grain was done by hand in the separate and successive steps of cutting, bundling, stacking, carting, storing, and threshing. Today these operations are performed simultaneously by powered combine harvesters, allowing one man to reap and thresh many acres in a day; likewise, pressure balers reduce the space required for storing straw to only a fraction of that needed in pre-industrial times. The efficient operation of this versatile machinery spelled death to the medieval barn, the maintenance of which has become an economic liability (cf. Charles and Horn, 1973, 5ff). to in the title must include hops (humblo), to the delivery, reception and distribution of which, in the monastery of Corbie, Adalhard devoted an entire paragraph.9 9 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 6, ed cit., 400-401; and translation, III, 116-117. More on hops will be said below, p. 261. The storage bins in the four corners of the Brewers' Granary are designated as "repositories of these same things—likewise" (repositoria eorundem rerum—similiter). There is no unequivocal reference to threshing in the inscriptions of this building, unless the word seru&amp;tur be interpreted to imply this activity, but the cruciform shape of the floor space left between the bins, by analogy with the threshing floor in the large Granary, suggests that the grain used in brewing might have been threshed in its own granary.

FENCE OR WALL EXTENDING TO EXTERNAL BOUNDARY 438.X SITE PLAN The alignment of installations for grinding, crushing, and parching grain (27, 28, 29) at the southern edge of the monastry complex appears to have been purposeful. If the topography of the site were ideal, with stream and land gradient permitting the development of water power, these facilities on the Plan could all have been water driven. (A reconstruction of the presumptive waterways of the Plan is suggested, I, 74, fig. 53; and Horn, 1975, 228, fig. 4. The Drying Kiln, Mortar, and Mill are sited next to the Monks' Bake and Brewhouse (9) and the Monks' Kitchen (8), and near the Bake and Brewhouse of the Pilgrims and Paupers (32). Traffic patterns and usage demonstrated that the location of mills and mortars was carefully planned. The Monks' Bakery and Kitchen required flour from the Mill; the Mortar produced crushed grain for brewing and for many other dishes basic to the monks' diet. The Drying Kiln was used not only for parching grain but for drying fruit. The noise of the mortars and mill would also have made it desirable to locate them at a distance from the center of monastic activities. V. 15 FACILITIES FOR GRINDING, CRUSHING, &amp; PARCHING OF GRAIN V.15.1 THREE IDENTICAL BUILDINGS FOR DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS Along the southern edge of the monastery, directly behind the Bake and Brew House for the Monks, are ranged three rectangular structures which house the apparatus needed in the three main phases of preparation of bread and beer: the grinding, crushing, and parching of the grain (fig. 438). Only one of these, the Drying Kiln, is identified by a descriptive legend: "the place in which the grain is parched" (locus ad torrendas annonas). The purposes of the other two may be inferred from their equipment, which consists of two large "mortars" (pilae) in one, and two "millstones" (molae) in the other. The buildings are identical in shape and may be assumed to be of identical construction. They measure 35 feet by 35 feet and are internally subdivided into a principal work space 25 by 35 feet, which contains the basic machinery, and a lean-to 10 feet wide, serving as the dormitory for workmen (eorundem famulorum cubilia). As in the more elaborate structures of the Plan, the servants' quarters are not accessible from the outside, but from the interior only. We assume that in their exterior appearance these buildings looked much like the mill shown in the background of the painting Seated Madonna by Gerhard Memling (fig. 439A), now in the Uffizi at Florence.1 1 Friedländer, VI, 1934, Pl. 35. The motif was copied by Lorenzo di Credi in a painting of the Madonna and Child with Angel, which is now in the Getty Museum at Malibu Beach, California. That Lorenzo di Credi copied it from Memling was brought to my attention by Juergen Schulz. Cf. Degenhard, 1932, 140. This painting also gives us an idea about the device used to provide power in the operation of mills and mortars—a subject that is controversial and requires further explanation. V.15.2 THE MILL MAN-, ANIMAL-, WATER-POWERED? THE ROMAN TRADITION Ferdinand Keller referred to the molae of St. Gall as "hand mills."2 2 Keller, 1844, 31 and 1860, 48. Albert Lenoir expressed the same view: "The place they occupy in the room, as well as the absence of any sort of motor mechanism in the vicinity, permits no doubt that these mills were operated by the hand of man." He felt convinced that they were similar to a type of mill common among the ancients, which was set in motion by driving the upper stone on a center spindle with a wooden bar (fig. 440).3 3 Lenoir, II, 1856, 404; and White, 1962. For commercial purposes the Romans used a larger variation of this type of mill; its size required the strength of a donkey or horse to turn it, or lacking such beasts of burden, it was turned by slaves (figs. 441442). In the first century B.C., these devices found a powerful rival in the water mill.4 4 The origins and the early history of the water mill have been dealt with in a comprehensive work by Bennet and Elton, 1898-1904, competently reviewed and amended in a recent article by Curwen, 1944, and brilliantly rediscussed in a masterful book by L.A. Moritz, 1958. There is also a basic study by Bloch, 1935, and an historical review by Forbes, 1957. Also see Horn, Journal of Medieval History, I, 1975 219-57. Among the Roman water mills two basic types can be distinguished: the vertical mill (fig. 443A), in which the millstone is turned by means of a water paddle attached to the lower end of a vertical spindle; and the horizontal or "Vitruvian" mill, the type in which a vertical water wheel is mounted on a horizontal axis, from which its rotation is transmitted to the millstone spindle by a pair of cogwheels (fig. 443B). The vertical mill is typologically the more primitive form, and therefore considered by some to be the earlier one.5 5 Others question this view of Moritz, 1958, 131ff. With the exception of a narrow stretch of land in southwestern France, this type is not well attested for medieval Germany, France and England. Cf. Curwen's distribution map, which is based on its modern survival forms (Curwen, 1944, 145, fig. 6). The "horizontal" water mill was probably a Roman invention, and judging from Vitruvius' description (23-25 B.C.), it was still a relatively recent phenomenon at the time of his writing. The earliest water mills of the city of Rome apparently were installed in the Tiber "a little before Augustus,"6 6 Moritz, op. cit., 135. but for the first three centuries of the Empire man-powered or animal-driven mills remained in the majority.7 7 To the hand-, donkey-, and water-driven mill, we will have to add as a fourth category the mola divino numine rotata, if the author of the Life of St. Winnoc may be trusted in his touching account of an event that occurred late in the seventh century. In order to demonstrate his humble spirit, Winnoc, the head of a small monastic cell in Worumholt, Flanders (today: Wormhoudt, Dept. du Nord, arr. Dunkerque), toward the close of his life decided "that he wished to rotate the mill with his own sacred hands [molam suis sacris rotare manibus], and thus in grinding grain into flour, served in daily labor the brothers who lived in this place as well as Christ's paupers whom he often received there with great benevolence." The brothers failed to understand how the feeble and aged Abbot could produce the amount of flour that left his mill daily, and spying upon him, discovered that the mill "was operated by the will of God" [divino numine rotatum] rather than by the Abbot's own hands. The latter simply stood to the side of the stones, his arms raised in the gesture of prayer (Vita Andomari, Bertini, Winnoci, chap. 25, in Mon. Germ. Hist., V, 1910. 771-72). It was only from the beginning of the fourth century onward that the water mill began to supersede the earlier forms. The earliest pictorial representation of the Vitruvian water mill is to be found on a fifth-century 439.A GERHARD MEMLING. SEATED MADONNA FLORENCE, UFFIZI GALLERY.

The Athenian mill was an overshot; the Vitruvian mill and the mill on the mosaic of the Palace at Constantinople were undershot. As early as A.D. 370 water-driven corn mills and saws for cutting marble were seen by Ausonius on the Ruwer, one of the tributaries of the Moselle River.10 10 "As he the river Ruwer turns his millstones in furious revolutions, and drives the shrieking saws through smooth blocks of marble," Ausonius, Mosella, lines 359-64. See Ausonius, ed. Evelyn-White, 1919, 253. But take note that Lynn White, 1962, 82ff, expresses some doubt concerning the reliability of the manuscript tradition of the Mosella poem. An intensely industrial application of water power for the grinding of grain was a Roman flour factory with sixteen wheels, erected 308-316 on a mountain slope at Barbegal near Arles (fig. 444). It worked with two sets of eight overshot wheels, fed by two channels of water from the aqueduct of Les Beaux, and could produce in a ten-hour day, with all wheels in operation, a total of twenty-eight tons of flour, sufficient to feed a population of 80,000—which fact suggests that it supplied the entire army of the province of Narbonne (besides meeting the local demands of Arles, which had a population of 30,000). There is archaeological evidence for the existence of a similar flour mill at Prety (Pistriacum), near Tournus, Burgundy, which ground the grain of the Saone 439.B GERHARD MEMLING.

These two facilities were unusual and owed their existence, unquestionably, to pressing military demands, but their existence nevertheless denotes a general trend. The historical motivations for this mounting interest of the fourth-century Romans in water as a source of power for grinding grain are still somewhat mysterious. One cause was, without doubt, the increasing shortage of slave labor in the later days of the Roman empire; another one, the new attitude toward labor associated with the Christian concept of caritas, resulting in the view that the forces of nature should be captured and trained to ease the life of man; still another cause, perhaps, was the fact that the center of cultural gravitation had shifted from the Mediterranean basin, where most rivers carry widely varying quantities of water in different seasons, to a northern area that abounded with mountain streams fed by a constant flow of water. Finally, but not least to be contended with: 440.A, B, C, D HAND OPERATED ROMAN MILLS Stationary or portable mechanisms like these shown above were used in every Greek and Roman household and were diffused throughout Europe by Greek and Roman armies. In Roman military camps, where soldiers ground their own corn, such handmills were a common sight. One mill was provided for every ten men; each soldier was prepared to carry his own thirty-day flour supply (Forbes, 1956, 109; Moritz, 1958, 116; Horn, 1975, 223, and 231, fig. 7). The upper stone, in examples A, B, C, D, weigh, respectively, about 130, 55, 30 and 45 pounds. Quern A, with two handles, could be operated by two persons. Quern D, a great advance in the art of milling, provided for adjustment of the upper stone by an under-table device that controlled clearance between stones at their outer rims, thereby regulating the fineness of the milled particles. Advances in the arts of military machines were paralleled by invention in the agrarian arts. the inventive freshness of the barbarians of the north, who were not slow in putting into the service of their growing manorial economy technological devices that offered new prospects of exploitation to the landlords who had the right and means of building and of operating these mills.12 12 For a succinct discussion of the converging historical factors that might have contributed to the increasing use of water power from the fourth century onward see Forbes, 1957, 601ff, on whom I am heavily leaning with this summary. On the new Christian attitude toward labor see Geoghegan, 1945, 93ff, and Benz, 1964, 241-63. ROMAN MILL IN POMPEII 441.A 441.B [After Mau, 1908, 408, fig. 237] The mill of Pompeii operates on the same principle as the table pepper mill. Its lower fixed stone (meta) is raised on a plinth that also forms a basin to catch freshly ground flour. The mill is charged with grain at the top; kernels fall into the space between the two stones (which can be enlarged or decreased by adjusting the spindle of the moving stone, the catillus, on its overarm) and are ground at the lower edge of the catillus flange where it touches the meta. 441.C ROMAN DONKEY MILLS POMPEII. REMAINS OF A ROMAN BAKERY WITH FOUR DONKEY MILLS AND A BAKING OVEN [after Forbes, 1956, 110, fig. 77] Donkey mills are known to have been used in Greece from about 300 B.C. They could be set up anywhere on land, and for that reason became the favorite Roman flour mill. The turning circles the animals were forced to follow in this and other mills of the type were brutally narrow. 442. ROME, MUSEO CHIARAMONTI. FRAGMENT OF A SARCOPHAGUS (2nd cent. B.C.)

A). The question of the relative distribution of water- and animal-powered mills in medieval Europe, and their differing functions, requires a new systematic study. In an inquiry into conditions prevalent in certain Carolingian territories west of the Rhine, Weber reaches the same conclusions that Bennett and Elton came to more generally: "Wenn man die urkundlich nachweisbaren Standorte berücksichtigt, weiss man auch, dass es sich bei unseren Beispielen nur um Wassermühlen gehandelt haben kann. Die von Tieren getriebene Mühle bleibt fortab die Ausnahme. Sie wird meist nur für Notfälle eingerichtet, z.B. auf Burgen und ummauerten Städten für die Zeiten langdauernder Belagerungen." (F. W. Weber, "Die ersten urkundlich nachweisbaren Wassermühlen westlich des Rheins," Pfälzer Heimat, vol. 3/4, Dec. 1972, 101-103. The journal is not easily available outside Germany.) ROMAN WATER MILLS 443.A Horizontal water wheel at the end of a vertical shaft fixed to the upper millstone. 443.B Vertical waterwheel, with power transmitted to the upper millstone by means of gears. [redrawn by C. B. Lund, after Forbes 1956, 595, fig. 540] The earliest water mill of which we have any record is one to which the Greek historian Strabo refers as having been built by the Pontic king, Mithradates VI Eupator, in his palace at Cabeira (some distance inland from the southern shore of the Black Sea), which was completed in 63 B.C. (For sources and a suggestion that this may indicate an Asiatic origin, as in the case of the water-powered triphammer, see Horn, 1975, pp. 226-27 and below, pp. 245f.) THE MONASTERY A PRIMARY AGENT IN THE HARNESSING OF WATER POWER AND IN DIFFUSING ITS USE The medieval monastery, a leader in all other aspects of rural economy, became one of the primary agents in the dissemination of water power for the grinding of grain as well as for many other uses. The earliest transalpine water mill put to monastic use is recorded by Gregory of Tours at the time of the Visigoth ruler Alaric (484-507).13 13 Gregorii Episcopi Turonensis Liber Vitae Patrum, chap. xviii, in Mon. Germ. Hist., Scriptores Rerum Merovingicarum, I, 1881, 734-35. Cf. Bloch, 1935, 545. This account is of particular interest, since it tells us how, during and for a short time after the construction of the monastery of Loches (Indres-et-Loire) by Abbot Ursus, "the brothers ground the wheat required for their sustenance by turning the millstones by hand" (molam manu vertentes). Ursus decided to supplant their labor by constructing a mill at the banks of the river Endria: "Setting stakes across the river and heaping a great pile of large stones, he built sluices, gathered the water in a channel, and by its impetus thus drove the wheel of the work into swiftly spinning BARBEGAL (ARLES), FRANCE 444.B CONJECTURAL RECONSTRUCTION [after Forbes 1956, 599, fig. 547] 444.A PLAN [after Forbes 1956, 598, fig. 546; redrawn by C.

Another water mill is mentioned by the same Gregory of Tours in his description of the city of Dijon.14 14 Gregorii Episcopi Turonensis Historia Francorum, Book III, chap. 19, in Mon. Germ. Hist., op. cit., 128; and The History of the Franks by Gregory of Tours, ed. Dalton, II, 1927, 103: "Before the gate it turns mill-wheels with wondrous speed." More evidence (so far overlooked) attesting the rapid spread of use of water mills in Merovingian Europe may be found in the Lives of Father Romanus (fifth century), of St. Remy (ca. 437-533), and of Athala, Abbot of Bobbio (615-627).15 15 For the life of Father Romanus see: Vita Patrum Iurensium Romani, Lupicini, Eugendi, Book I, chap. 18, in Mon.

Hiltrudis Virginis in Coenobio Lesciensi, chap. 2, in Schlosser, 1896, 226-27, No. 705. Two water mills on the Leto River were given to the monastery of Aniane by Charlemagne in a donation charter dated Aachen, June 799;17 17 Mon. Germ. Hist., Dipl. Karol, ed. Mühlbacher, I, 1906, 252, No. 188. another one in the vicinity of Dover is mentioned in a charter of King Ethelbert, dated 762.18 18 Kemble, I, 1839, 132, No. 108; cf. Curwen, 1944, 133. The context of the chapter in which Abbot Adalhard in 822 defines the duties and privileges of the millers employed by the Abbey of Corbie and its various dependencies leaves no doubt that he is referring to water-powered mills, since he stipulates that the millers be furnished, inter alia, with everything that is required for the maintenance and repair of their sluices (sclusa).19 19 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 12, ed. Semmler, in Corp. Cons. Mon., I, 1963, 379. The Abbey of St.-Riquier in 798 had a water-driven mill which received its power from a small stream called Scarduo running through the middle of the monastery.20 20 "Primo enim acqua rivuli Scarduonis medium praeterfluens claustrum, ibidem farinarium in usus fratrum volvebat." (Schlosser, 1896, 263, No. 792). From the ninth century onward references to water mills are made with increasing frequency. An interesting incident in connection with the establishment of water mills is the account of the failure of Abbot Habertus of Laubach (d. A.D. 835) to cut an aqueduct to channel water to the mills through the rugged slopes of the mountain which surrounded his monastery.21 21 Folcuini Gesta Abbatis Lobiensis, chap. 12, ibid., 67-68, No. 237: "temptavit et idem abbas aquaeductum a foreste ducere, ardua montium sulcans, sed perficere non potuit opus praeposterum et sero inchoatum." In the centuries that follow, references to water mills become legion. The Domesday Book (ca. 1080) lists 5,624 of them.22 22 Hogden, 1939. From the twelfth century on they are frequently depicted in illuminated manuscripts. In the precision of their detail, some of these representations compare favorably with modern engineering drawings; (cf. fig. 445).23 23 Fig. 445 is fol. 112a in the Hortus Deliciarum of Herrade de Landsberg (ed. Straub and Keller, 1901, pl. XXX). Herrade became Abbess of the monastery of Hohenburg in 1167 and died in 1195. The earliest pictorial representation of a medieval water mill (according to Bennet and Elton, II, 73) is to be found in a French manuscript of the twelfth century, British Museum, London, Harley Ms. 334, fol. 71v. It is undershot, as are most of the medieval mills depicted in manuscripts. That overshot wheels were in use, however, as early as the thirteenth century, is demonstrated by a water mill represented in the Sachsenspiegel; cf. von Künssberg, 1934, fol. 65 (the manuscript dates from 1221-24). EVIDENCE FOR A WATER-POWERED MILL In the light of this abundant and clear evidence, Keller's and Lenoir's opinion that the mills of St. Gall were hand-operated mechanisms seems quite open to debate. What Keller had in mind, I should think, was the kind of hand mill that is depicted in a German manuscript of the fourteenth century (fig. 446), reproduced by Bennet and 446. MEDIEVAL HAND MILL The drawing, from a German 14th-cent. manuscript, shows a mill derivative of the hand-operated Roman mill (fig. 440. A, B) that survived the advent of the watermill. 447. HAUSBUCH MASTER. MILLING APPARATUS CA. 1480 [after Bossert and Stork, 1912, pl. 46] Although the drawing is rendered in the clumsy perspective of a Middle Rhenish master of the pre-Dürer period, it portrays the milling mechanism with great factual accuracy. The pen and ink drawing appears in a manuscript written and illustrated by an official who in 15th-century Germany was called "Büchsenmeister" —master of firearms. Of relatively high social standing, such a personage would today hold a position comparable with civil or military engineer. (The manuscript is the property of Fürst Waldburg-Wolfegg-Waldsee.) 448.B, C PLAN OF ST. GALL. MILL AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION. GROUND PLAN Waterpower for the Mill and Mortar of the Plan of St. Gall is a viable proposal; we have therefore reconstructed the mechanisms as water driven, for these reasons: As regards the millstones, their size, at a literal diameter of 7½ feet, would tend to eliminate the possibility of hand operation. Their depiction on the Plan lacks any indication of drive systems, but that lack is consistent with other such omissions where practicalities, to be left to a master craftsman to execute, have been eliminated in favor of clarity of scale and function. The alignment of mills and mortar on the southern edge of the Plan site would facilitate use of water power assuming that a stream existed on the site and could be channeled down a gradient sufficient to provide it (cf. I, 68-69 and fig. 53). Abundant documentary evidence shows that from the end of the 5th century onward and with increasing frequency in succeeding centuries, monastic mills of transalpine Europe were water powered; finally, references to animal-driven mills in these some sources are almost entirely lacking (see above, p. 228, fig. 442 caption). We have already discussed the question of why the Romans, although they had it, made scant use of the water mill; whereas the young barbarian nations of the north adopted and diffused it with enthusiasm. To reasons already set forth we suggest here, as a factor so far overlooked, that the strongest impetus for the phenomenal spread of waterpower in the early Middle Ages came not from the secular world but from the ascendancy of Benedictine monasticism. The records of many abbots show that extensive monastic estates included mills located far outside the immediate vicinity of the monastery; Gozbert himself doubtless would have controlled several beyond the two proposed by the Plan for the monastery. Adalhard records that Corbie's bakeries had to produce 450 one-pound loaves each day, for which the monastery drew on an annual volume of 5,475 modii of grain from 15 mills, each of six millstones, all of which had to be maintained in good working order (see III, 106-107). And the abbey of St.-Germain-des-Prés had several times again that number of mills (see Horn, 1975, 248ff, for details and sources.) Building and operating such facilities required impressive capital investment dependent on ownership of great acreage and an unparalleled degree of managerial competence. The monastic school-trained leaders of the period brought to the vast monastic holdings the ingenuity and spirit of radical innovation that necessity alone would have made welcome. In addition, the monastries and their high officials had the pressing moral committment to free the monks from long hours of arduous physical labor, in order to further the Opus Dei. By contrast the secular world, lacking intellectual advantages, integrated physical resources, administrative unity, and religious incentives, lagged behing the great monastries in technical innovation; as in most labor-intensive societies, medieval secular institutions tended toward conservatism. Gregory of Tours leaves as an anecdote about Abbot Ursus that constitutes the first documentary evidence of a monastic mill. After relating that "on account of this [water mill] the work that formerly had to be done by many monks could now be accomplished by a single brother," Gregory repeats a dialogue between Ursus and Sichlerius, a Visigoth and nobleman whose land bordered the abbey's, and who had seen first hand the installation of the new mill and its sluices: "Covetous to acquire the mill, he told the abbot, `Give me this mill, to become my property, and I shall give you, in return, whatever you ask for,' Replied the Abbot: `It was only with the greatest of pain, on account of our poverty, that we were able to install this mill; and now we cannot give it to you lest our brethren die of hunger.' Sichlerius retorted: `If you wish to give it to me by your own free will, I shall be grateful. Otherwise I will take it by force, or build another mill, for which I shall divert the water from your sluice; and in this way it will no longer be able to turn your wheel.' The abbot replied, `You will not do what God shall not permit you to do, you will not take it at all!' Sichlerius, in ire, did what he had threatened to do, but because of divine intervention, the water failed to turn the wheels of his mill." Thus the intransigent noble was defeated. The story, embodying all the social dichotomies between secular and religious spheres, is symptomatic and may have remained so for the most of the Middle Ages. Ingenuity and initiative, in addition to divine justice, were clearly on the side of the abbot. PLAN OF ST. GALL. MILL 448.D LONGITUDINAL SECTION 448.E TRANSVERSE SECTION AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION Elton.24 24 Bennet and Elton, I, 1898, 163. For modern parallels of this type of hand mill, see Meringer, 1909, 166-67. It is obvious that two hand-operated units of this type could never have produced the volume of flour needed in a settlement the size of that represented on the Plan of St. Gall. Hand-operated mills, because they were subject to the limitations of manual operation, were bound to be small. Yet the millstones of the Plan are not only large, they seem colossal. They are drawn at a diameter of 7½ feet. Even if the representation is not literal,25 25 This dimension should not be taken too literally. The maker of the Plan, as has been previously shown, defined all pieces of equipment and furniture as multiples of the 2½-foot module. When a piece of equipment did not fit into this graduation, he rounded off its dimensions to the next higher modular value, never to the lower one. If the diameter of the millstone is rendered as three 2½-foot modules (7½ feet), this means that it was larger than two 2½-foot modules (5 feet), but not necessarily as large as three 2½-foot modules (7½ feet). It could have been at any reasonable point between 5 feet and 7½ feet. (Cf. our discussion of the dimensions of the beds in the Monk's Dormitory I, 89-90, as well as the general analysis of the scale and construction method used in designing the Plan, I, 77ff). I have not been able to find any reliable information on the size of medieval millstones. The average diameter may not have been more than 4 feet. But monastic millstones, because of the immense volume of bread to be baked per day, (in Corbie 420 one-pound loaves daily! cf. III, p. 106) they are likely to have been considerably larger. In the summer of 1969 while traveling in Yugoslavia, I saw a millstone 6 feet in diameter, unfortunately in a place the name of which I have forgotten, but later on, on the same trip, in the medieval granary of the Abbey of Le Thoronet in Provence, I came across a millstone with a diameter of 5 feet, 5 inches (it is visible in the interior view of that building, reproduced on p. 88 of Père M. A. Dimier's L'Art Cistercien, published in 1962). such weight and volume could not possibly have been set in motion by manual operation. There are other factors suggesting water power. The drafter of the Plan, as we have seen, did not consider it part of his task to include a delineation of the monastery's water system, but he was not oblivious to the fact that buildings requiring water power would have to be located in places to which water could easily be conducted. This is clearly indicated by the way he carefully aligned all the buildings and activities requiring water along the edge of 449.C LUTTRELL PSALTER (1340). LONDON, BRITISH MUSEUM. ADD.

The general problem of the application of water-power to industry during the Middle Ages has been dealt with by Prof. Bradford B. Blaine of Scripps College, in a doctoral thesis submitted at the University of California at Los Angeles in 1966, and will form the subject of a forthcoming book by Prof. Blaine, entitled Water-Power in Medieval Industry. RECONSTRUCTION OF MILLING APPARATUS The reconstruction of the milling apparatus poses no major problem, since both Herrade de Landsberg (1195)27 27 Herrade de Landsberg, Hortus Deliciarum, fol. 112a, ed. Straub and Keller, 1879-1899, pl. XXX. and the Hausbuch Master (ca. 1480)28 28 Das Mittelalterliche Hausbuch, pag. 48a, ed. Bossert and Storck, 1912, pl. 46. have furnished us with very detailed drawings of water-driven milling mechanisms (figs. 445 and 447). Herrade's mill is undershot. A large waterwheel transmits its rotation through an axle to a smaller wheel, the cogs of which are geared into a vertical drum. The vertical power of the driving wheel is thus converted into the horizontal motion of the millstone. A hopper feeds the grain from overhead into a hole in the center of the upper stone, the so-called "runner". This system is essentially the same as that of the so-called Vitruvian mill, except for a difference in the speed of transmitting power. The Vitruvian mill is relatively small and moves faster than the wheel that turns the millstone. In the medieval mill, with its larger waterwheel, the transmission is from slower to faster.29 29 Cf. Adrian, 1951, 57, fig. 31. In our reconstruction of the Mill of the Plan (fig. 448A-E) we have adopted the latter system. The Mill of the Plan would have taken care only of those milling operations which were performed within the monastic enclosure. On its outlying estates a monastery usually operated a great number of additional mills. According to Guérard's calculations, at the time of Abbot Irminon (ca. 800-826) the Abbey of St.-Germain des Prés managed as many as eighty-four mills on its outlying estates.30 30 Guérard, 1844, 632. The HAND-OPERATED MORTARS AND PESTLES OF OAK 449.A.1 449.A.2 [after Keller, 1860, 45 and 50] BELTIS, LAKE WALLENSTADT, SWITZERLAND Devices of this kind, used for crushing cereal grains, were in the Middle Ages employed in every household; porridge made from these grains was one of the principal items in the common man's diet. status of the millers in charge of these installations, to judge from the Administrative Directives of Adalhard of Corbie, differed from that of the other monastic tenants in that they were exempt from the manual labor to which the other tenants were held, such as "plowing, sowing, harvesting grain or hay, making malt or hops, delivering wood or anything else in the service of the lord" (ad opus dominicum).31 31 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 12, ed. Semmler, in Corp. Cons Mon., I, 1963, 379, and translation, III, 107. Adalhard stipulates that each miller was to be provided with a pair of oxen and other things necessary for the sustenance of himself and his entire family, so that he could raise pigs, geese, and chickens, and set up his mill, and might obtain or manufacture all such materials as he needed in order to improve his mill, repair his sluice, transport his millstone, and everything else that he might need to own or manufacture.32 32 Ibid. 449.B LE THORONET, VAR, FRANCE MORTAR AND PESTLE Hand mortars of this kind continued in use in the Middle Ages along with water-powered trip hammers (figs. 454, 457), and were important in seasons when streams were too low to drive trip hammers. 450. MODERN TRIP-HAMMER [redrawn after Meringer, 1906, 16, fig. 26] Trip-hammers of this type are used even today in areas stretching from Central Europe throughout the whole of Asia, as far as India, China, and Japan. The hammer shown is of the foot operated type. V.15.3 THE MORTARS MAN- OR WATER-POWERED? CONFLICTING VIEWS The crushing devices designated by the term pilae, i.e., "pestles," in the house lying west of the Mill (fig. 438), raise the same problems posed by the milling apparatus. Were they operated by hand or water? Keller, in this case too, took the first position. He drew attention to two old hand-operated mortars which he discovered in the remote village of Beltis on the lake of Wallenstadt in Switzerland (fig. 449 A.1, A.2).33 33 Keller, 1860, 48-50. One was three feet high, cut out of a solid trunk of oak, with the interior hollowed out conically. The pestle, likewise, was made of a single piece of oak, except for its handle, and was studded with nails at its base. This, Keller thought, must have been the contrivance that the drafter of the Plan of St. Gall had in mind when he drew his peculiar L- or key-shaped pilae (fig. 438). 451. HOKUSAI. JAPANESE TRIP-HAMMER (19th cent.) [after Singer, Holmgard, Hall, II, 1956, 107, fig. 71] If his expression of grim determination is an indication, the man acting as counterweight to the hammer could scarcely have worked harder using a mortar and pestle for his task. That instruments of the Beltis type were used during the Middle Ages is beyond question, and easy proof of this may be found inter alia in a delightful marginal drawing of the Luttrell Psalter (fig. 449C), which shows a bearded cook pounding a huge mortar with a pestle almost twice his own height.34 34 Luttrell Psalter, fol. 207; see Millar, 1932, pl. 166. The mortar, apparently made of iron or bronze, reaches to slightly above the knee of the pounding cook, and by that criterion should have been meant to have a height and width of roughly two feet. The largest implement of that type I have ever examined is a mortar carved of a single block of stone, that stands now in the medieval granary of the Abbey of Le Thoronet in Provence, only a few yards away from the millstone discussed in an earlier part of this chapter. This mortar (fig. 449B) has a round base, 2 feet in diameter, is 3½ feet high, and 4 feet wide at the top. Its pounding cavity tapers from the rectangular opening at the top to a conical form at the bottom. The pestle—which does not look to me to be the original—is a roughly hewn trunk of a young tree, about 9 inches thick and nearly 5 feet high. In testing it on the spot it seemed to me that it could be worked with some effort by a single man, and with ease by two men lifting it in conjunction. Yet I would be inclined to think that in the Middle Ages mortars and pestles of this order of magnitude were water driven, rather than hand-operated mechanisms. This was also the view of Rudolf Meringer who has made a special study of this type of instrument. In an article on the implements of the pinsere series and their names, published in 1909, Meringer35 35 Meringer, 1909, 24ff a study that was brought to my attention by Lynn White years ago, when I first concerned myself with this problem. I am greatly obliged to Lynn White for having subsequently kept me apprised of other publications bearing on this subject. drew attention to the fact that the pilae of the Plan of St. Gall (fig. 438) were not only considerably larger than those with which they had been compared by Keller (fig. 449A) but also of vastly different shape. He claimed that, rather, they bore striking resemblance to a type of crushing device which in German is called Anke, and illustrated his views by a startling juxtaposition of the pilae of St. Gall and a drawing of a modern water-driven iron hammer (fig. 453).36 36 Meringer had, in fact, already established this comparison two years earlier; see Meringer, 1907, 285, figs. 8 and 9. The earliest pictorial representation of a water-driven recumbent western tilt-hammer appears to be a woodcut in Spechthart's Flores Musicae, published in 1488 (fig. 455).37 37 Schmithals and Klemm, 1958, 4. In an earlier period this contrivance was operated by hand or foot, as it was still in very recent times in Galicia (fig. 450), Poland, China, and Japan in very much the manner in which this is depicted in a whimsical drawing by the Japanese painter Hokusai (fig. 451). Man-powered tilt-hammers of this type, as was subsequently shown, were used in China in remote periods, and their design and mode of operation is well attested by two small models in green glazed pottery from the Han period (206 B.C. to A.D. 220) which are now in the Nelson Art Gallery (fig. 452A-C), Kansas City, as well as a Han moulded brick found at P'en-shan Hsien, in the Szechuan Provincial Museum, Chengtu (fig. 452D).38 38 On foot-operated trip-hammers, see Needham, IV:2, 1965, 390ff. Meringer was convinced that the pilae of the Plan of St. Gall did not belong to the foot-operated type, but that they were water driven, and he attempted a reconstruction (fig. 454), in which the pestle beams were alternately lifted and released for fall by the cogs of a cylindrical drum mounted directly upon the axle of a water wheel, as in the modern iron hammer (fig. 453). Hydraulic trip-hammers of this or a similar design are attested for China through unequivocal literary descriptions as early as the reign of Emperor Wang Mang (A.D. 9-23) and through less reliable sources perhaps even as early as the third century B.C.39 39 On water-powered Chinese trip-hammers see Needham, op. cit., 392. The earliest printed illustration of this mechanism is in the Nung Shu of 1313 A.D. See Needham, op. cit., 395. Meringer could not prove that the camming action employed in this device was known in Carolingian times,40 40 On cams and camming action in general see Lynn White, 1962, 79, 81 and 128ff as well as Needham, op. cit., 83, 84 and 384-85. and his interpretation of the pilae of St. Gall as hydraulic cam-operated pounding mechanisms did not come to the attention of Marc Bloch who, in his classical and widely read study on the advent and spread of the water mill, referred to the pilae of St. Gall as "a crushing instrument which, on the plan, was certainly not shown as being water driven;"41 41 Bloch, 1935, 543: "Un instrument de broyage qui, sur le plan, n'était certainement pas mû par l'eau." a view which was reiterated in 1954 by Bertrand Gille,42 42 Gille, 1954, 10. and subsequently adopted, although perhaps not with the same degree of conviction, by Lynn White in 1962.43 43 Lynn White, 1962, 83 note 2. Finally, in 1965, it looked as though Meringer's interpretation had received a final blow, when Joseph Needham, in his monumental Science and Civilization in China, after a thorough account of the Chinese history of the hydraulic trip-hammer44 44 Needham, op. cit., 390-96. advanced the theory that this mechanism was introduced in Europe "about the time of Marco Polo," in connection with the fulling trade when much other Chinese textile machinery appears to have made its way to Europe. Needham proclaimed that all water powered European stamp mills prior to that period were machines in which pestle beams moved in vertical action in the manner illustrated by a drawing made by an anonymous Hussite engineer around 1430 (fig. 456).45 45 Munich, National Library, Ms. Cat. 197, fol. 10r. See Beck, 1899, 279ff. Cf. below, p. 248, n.67, on the date of the ms. EVIDENCE FOR WATER-POWERED TRIP-HAMMERS The Plan of St. Gall contradicts these views. The pilae of its Mortar House can under no circumstances be interpreted as vertical pestles. Their design—a hammer attached at right angles to a pestle beam connecting at the opposite end with a body of cylindrical shape—leaves no doubt that they were recumbent hammers activated by the cams of a revolving drum. Their dimensions as well as their location, next to a water-driven grain mill, suggests that they were water powered. The pestle beam alone is 10 feet long (4 standard modules), the hammer has a length of 6 feet (2½ standard modules) and the drum has a diameter of 6¾ feet. The over-all length comes close to 17½ feet. This is a very heavy piece of equipment that could not possibly be operated by hand or foot. The Plan may somewhat exaggerate the dimensions of the drum,46 46 Yet even that is highly doubtful. We have shown in our chapter on the Scale and Construction Method Used in Designing the Plan that the author of the original scheme of the Plan was acutely aware of the realities involved in his scaling of objects. It is possible, nevertheless that minor distortions were brought into the drawing when the Plan was copied. Small objects tend to be drawn slightly enlarged as they are traced. The odd dimension of 6¾ feet of the hammer head and drum may in the original scheme have been 5 feet. but it leaves no 452.A MODEL. FARMYARD DETAIL WITH FOOT-OPERATED TRIP-HAMMER. HAN DYNASTY, 206 B.C.-220 A.D. IRRIDESCENT GREEN GLAZED POTTERY, 8¾ × 6 × 2½ INCHES question about the presence of a drum, which makes sense only within the context of a water-powered apparatus. Marc Bloch's argument that water is not shown on the Plan, does not militate against this conclusion. We have shown in our chapter on omissions and oversights how waterways, although nowhere in evidence on the Plan, could be a determining factor in siting of facilities dependent on this power source, and were therefore clearly a possibility taken into account by the designing architect.47 47 See above, pp. 68-70. The crushing mechanisms of the Mortar House of the Plan of St. Gall are, as far as I can see, the earliest historical evidence of the use of hydraulic trip-hammers in Western Europe. Their appearance on the Plan makes it clear that water-driven trip-hammers were, at the time when the original scheme was drawn, i.e., in 816-817, considered standard equipment of a paradigmatic Carolingian monastery. There is no reason to presume that the inventor of the scheme was also the inventor of the mechanism. The system as such may, even in Europe, have been of considerably greater age. It may have been diffused in Frankish times from China, as the stirrup certainly was, as the two forms of modern horse-harnesses probably were, and as the mechanical crank may have been.48 48 Lynn White, 1962, 1-2, 14-28, 139-46 (stirrup), 59-61, 67-69, 156-57 (harness) 79, 81, 128ff (crank). Needham, op. cit., 317 note e (stirrup), 304-28 (harness), 111-19 (crank). A SURVIVING MEDIEVAL HYDRAULIC TRIP-HAMMER I feel strengthened in this conjecture by the circumstantial historical evidence surrounding a water-powered medieval trip-hammer that came to my attention, in the summer of 1970, while travelling in the mountains of the province of León in Spain. This mechanism, not only intact but able to be operated, is housed in a smithy located in the valley of Compludo, on the grounds of a former monastery of that name. San Fructuosus, a Visigoth of royal blood and the founder of Spanish monachism, established Compludo as the first of a vast web of monasteries. The trip-hammer owes its anachronistic survival to the 452.B The processing of grain for domestic use in China during the centuries just before and after the birth of Christ in the West reveals wholly familiar technologies and associations. The model of the farmyard (fig. 452. A) contains, in addition to the trip-hammer, a small mill and what appears to be a parching kiln built into an enclosure wall—an association also reflected in the Plan of St. Gall, some 6 centuries later. The trip-hammer in the model (figs. 452.A-B) was the simplest of mechanisms; in it is applied the principle of fulcrum and lever actuated by direct force. 452.C WILLIAM ROCKHILL NELSON GALLERY OF ART, ATKINS MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS, KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI IRRIDESCENT GREEN GLAZED POTTERY, 10¾ × 3½ × 3½ INCHES complete and utter isolation of the site, which even today, is accessible by only a stony mountain road whose narrow and precipitous course offers to the unexpecting modern visitors moments of breathtaking suspense.49 49 The valley of Compludo lies in the Montes de León some 23 km. southeast of the city of Ponferrada. It is not shown on the Mapa Oficial de Carreteras (scale 1:400,000) of Spain. To reach it one must travel from Pontferrada to the mountain villages of Molinaseca, Riego de Ambroz and Acebo; and from the latter in precipitous descent (only advisable to motorists with experience in rough mountain travel) to the completely isolated valley of Compludo, formed by the confluence of two narrow mountain streams, the Miera and the Miruello which shed their water into the Boeza River. The scenery is of outstanding beauty. The instrument is described by Florentino-Augustin Diez Gonzáles,50 50 Florentino-Augustin Diez González, "Notitias de la vida políticosocial de la España de San Fructuoso," in San Fructuoso y su tiempo, 1966, 7-57. in a study of the political and social life of the Spain of San Fructuosus, which also includes a sketch of this unusual mechanism.51 51 The drawing in Gonzáles's article, while portraying operational details of the smithy of Compludo with great veracity, is not quite realistic in its perspective. The trip-hammer is not longer, but 3 feet shorter than the tree by which it is activated and the diameter of the waterwheel is greater than appears on the drawing (cf. Horn, 1975, 245). It conforms in all respects to the trip-hammer shown in Spechtshart's woodcut of 1488 (fig. 455) and the modern specimen discussed by Meringer (fig. 453), except that it is considerably larger. The water that sets the Compludo hammer into motion is channeled from the confluence of two narrow mountain streams, the Miera and the Miruello, into a collecting basin (banzao) from where it falls upon the heavy wooden studs of a waterwheel. This wheel, 8 feet in diameter, is driven by a shaft (árbol) made of chestnut, 16 feet long and 2½ feet thick. Rotating horizontally this timber, hardened by age like stone, activates with its wooden cogs 452.D CHENGTU, SZECHUAN, PROVINCIAL MUSEUM RUBBING, CLAY TOMB TILE, (46 × 28cm) DETAIL, EASTERN HAN PERIOD, 23-220 A.D.

MODERN TILT-HAMMER (SCHWANZHAMMER) PLAN AND SIDE ELEVATION [redrawn after Meringer, 1907, 285, fig. 10] The cam block driving the hammer can be linked to a drive system as sophisticated as one powered by steam, or as simple as one driven by an animal on a treadmill. a sturdy lever (palanca), 13 feet long, at whose extremity the smashing hammer (mazo) rises and falls. The rhythm or beat of the stamp can be controlled from within the forge by a second mechanism that augments or decreases the flow of the water turning the wheel, as the varying nature of the work requires (sketched roughly in Gonzáles's drawing). The ore is smelted in the furnace by a fire fanned to intense heat by means of air drafted into it by hydraulic action (shown in the background of Gonzáles's sketch) and under the beat of the hammer, converted into malleable iron.52 52 I do not know at what time in history water pressure was first used to blow air into furnaces. Lynn White, in a recent essay on "Medieval Uses of Air" does not make reference to the existence of any such systems (Lynn White, 1970, 92-100). To watch this primordial mechanism in operation was truly an awe-inspiring experience. MONASTIC ECONOMY AND WATER POWER UNDER ST. FRUCTUOSUS The date of the hammer is unknown.53 53 In an earlier study (Horn, 1975, 254 note 13) I expressed the hope that radiocarbon analysis of the timbers of axle, hammer, and waterwheel might in the future help establish the age of the hammer. Returning to the site in 1974, I discovered that all these timbers were in process of being replaced. The carpenter in charge of the work held the view that because of the heavy strain imposed upon these members when in daily operation, such repairs would have to be made every 40 to 50 years. This does not militate against the assumption of a medieval origin for the mechanism on this site. Local tradition ascribes it to "Romanesque period" (edad romanica). 454. PLAN OF ST. GALL. TILT-HAMMER PERSPECTIVE VIEW [redrawn after Meringer, 1909, fig. 35] Meringer interpreted the two trip-hammers of the Mortar House of the Plan as being activated by a cam block formed on a single timber extending, as part of an axle shaft, from the hub of the waterwheel. González believes that mechanisms of this type might well have been an integral part of the monastic economy of the time of San Fructuosus (d. 665).54 54 "La [herrería] de Compludo signe siendo un monumento vivo, casi intacto, que bien pudo connocer los tiemposos frutusianos." Gonzáles, op. cit., 44. This view is not so 455. SPECHTSHART. FLORES MUSICAE STRASSBOURG, 1488, fol. 7v [courtesy of the University Library, Freiburg i. Br., Germany] The woodcut shows an iron forge with a water-powered tilt-hammer activated by a cylindrical cam block mounted on the axle of a waterwheel. Two blacksmiths forge iron on an anvil with the hammer's aid; behind them Pythagoras weighs hammers. In the background, Tubal chisels musical notes into a column, representing Pythagorean philosophical preoccupation with order, number, and harmony of the spheres of the Ptolemaic universe (cf. I, 231, fig. 187). shocking as it might appear to be at first exposure. The seventh century, as has been shown in the preceding chapter, was the great century of systematic application of water power to milling in the economy of coenobitic monachism.55 55 Cf. above, pp. 229ff. The development was spurred by the need to provide great quantities of flour for the sustenance of large numbers of men whose religious activities required that they be freed from certain common forms of labor, in order to devote themselves to the more serious task of serving God in prayer and chant. It is not an unreasonable conjecture that the same need may also have fostered the invention or adoption of the cam which made it possible to harness water for tasks requiring the crushing blow of a rising and falling mechanical hammer. It is quite possible that this idea (or its adoption) was first conceived in connection with iron works where the brutal blow of a hydraulic stamp offered advantages highly superior to those that could be derived from its use in the lighter task of crushing grain or of fulling cloth. The banks of the rivers in the mountains of Eastern Leon, where San Fructuosus founded his first monasteries, carry iron deposits important enough to be mentioned by Pliny the Elder and other Roman writers;56 56 Gonzáles, loc. cit., but without specific references. numerous localities in this area, now in ruins or deserted, carry even today the name herrería (iron forge).57 57 Gonzáles, loc. cit., lists one in the vicinity of Vega de Valcarce; another one in Puente Petra (near Oencia); a third one in Marciel (near Quintana de Fuseros) which gave its name, Ferreria, to a village that has since disappeared; a fourth one in Paradaseca. In a fifth, the herreria of Montes (near San Clemente de Valdueza) the stamping mechanism is so well preserved as to permit its reconstruction. The Fructuosan monastic economy formed an ideal ambiance for the invention of such a power mechanism. It created a sudden and vast demand for agricultural tools by converting virtually overnight deserted valleys into densely populated rural communities, formed not only by the multitude of monks that settled in the monastery itself, but in addition by a veritable army of secular followers who were allowed to establish themselves as tenants in the vast stretches of land which the monastery owned in the valleys and mountains around it. Among them were members of the former household of San Fructuosus (whose paternal inheritance was enormous), magnates from the royal court with their entire families, soldiers from the Visigothic army who fell under the spell of the saint, and in a mystical commotion that had no precedent, followed him in such numbers that their chieftains found themselves compelled to legislate against such wholesale desertion of the army and flight into the country.58 58 For more detail on these historical conditions, see the chapter "Los Pobladores del Valle," by Antonio Viñayo Gonzáles, in San Fructuoso y su tiempo, 1966, 195ff.; as well as the chapter "La España rural des siglo VII," by Florentino-Augustín Diez Gonzáles, ibid., 47ff. A blacksmith capable of converting ore into iron with the aid of water power and shaping it into usable tools could meet the demands created by such a sudden population increase in the country, and the 456.

Date of the initial installation unknown, concept possibly dating from Visigothic period. See caption above. 457.A PERSPECTIVE VIEW In 1975 we paid another visit to the Compludo forge and discovered that the trip-hammer we first inspected in 1970 was being rebuilt, and the waterwheel replaced by a slightly sturdier one. The hammer had been moved to the outside yard to serve as a template for its replacement. The sturdy cammed trunk, strongest member of the mechanism and subject to great torsional strain, was considered in good enough condition to serve another span in the life of the hammer. It had earlier been reinforced lengthwise by iron bars banded to it with iron hoops. The carpenter directing the work was convinced that in continuous use, wheel and hammer would need replacement every 40 years, the main trunk every century. He shared local belief that the mechanism is medieval and would tend to retain its original design for a virtually indefinite span of time, even though its components were periodically renewed. These drawings were made with aid of measurements taken in 1975. They do not show the apparatus governing the flow of water to the wheel and thus the speed of the hammer's action. For rough sketches of that mechanism and the means by which air is drafted into the forge furnace, a function also associated with the flow of water to the wheel race, we still depend exclusively on the drawing published by Gonzáles (1966, 46) and reproduced by Horn (1975, 245). 457.B 457.C 457.D presence of ore in these places would give an added stimulus to the adoption of devices facilitating their production. The Romans, it is generally conceded, did not make any use of water-powered trip-hammers transmitting the rotational movement of the wheel and its axle into the vertical beat of a recumbent hammer by means of cogs. China, unquestionably is the prime inventor. But the Plan of St. Gall attests that at the beginning of the ninth century such mechanisms were, even in the West, well known and widely employed. This seems to vitiate the theory of its westward diffusion by Marco Polo and suggests that the knowledge of this invention came to Europe in the wake of contact established with the Far East, in the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. by the invasion of the Huns and other Asiatic tribes, with whom the Visigoths were in close, and often mortal, association over long periods of time. FROM CHINA TO EUROPE DURING THE MIGRATION PERIOD? The display of water-powered trip-hammers on the Plan of St. Gall gives added credence to such literary sources as had been adduced by Bloch, Gille and Carus-Wilson59 59 Bloch, 1935, 543ff; Gille, 1953, 282ff and 1954, 8-10; Carus Wilson, 1941, 44ff. in favor of the contention that hydraulic trip-hammers were operated in eleventh- and twelfth-century Europe; as well as the claim advanced by Uccelli and White60 60 Uccelli, 1944, 131; Lynn White, 1962, 83ff. that the fulling mills of Prato made use of hydraulic trip-hammers from the beginning of this industry in A.D. 983.61 61 Bradford B. Blaine, in his forthcoming book, Water-Power in Medieval Industry, focuses more intensely than has hitherto been done on the profoundly significant industrial revolution, discernible by the beginning of the eleventh century throughout the Alpine forelands, involving the marriage of the waterwheel and the cam, as witnessed by the appearance of water-driven hammers used for fulling, crushing hemp, and forging iron (personal communication). The pilae of the Plan of St. Gall disclose that this union was achieved considerably earlier (cf. p. 235, n. 26 and my remarks, pp. 237ff). An even earlier reference (datable 883-904) to molinis vel pilis is to be found in the Formulae Sangallenses miscellaneae.62 62 Formulae Sangallenses Miscellaneae, Chap. 11, in Mon. Germ. Hist. Leges, Sec. V, 1886, 385: Dedi itaque ego N. ad cellam sancti ill. villam eidem loco vicinam . . . id est domibus, pomariis, exitibus et introitibus, viis, aquis aquarumque decursibus, at clausuris, molinis vel pilis, agris, pratis, silvis communibus aut propriis pascuisque in omnem partem vergentibus mancipiisque, iumentis et peccoribus vel cunctis utensilibus. The passage was brought to my attention by Bradford B. Blaine. EUROPEAN SOURCES BEFORE MARCO POLO A literary account of poetic beauty of water-driven trip-hammers, written decades before Marco Polo's visit to China (A.D. 1280), is to be found in a remarkable thirteenth-century description of the waterworks of the monastery of Clairvaux. There, after telling how the river Aube had been deflected from its natural course, the writer traces the water's path as it travels from workshop to workshop, "launching itself at once upon the wheels of the mill, and lashed into foam by their motion, it grinds the meal under the weight of the millstones, and separates the fine from the coarse by a sieve of fine tissue." Then, after a brief excursion into the brewery, "where it fills the boiler and is heated for brewing. . . not hesitating nor refusing any who requires its aid," it follows the call of the fullers, at whose workshop, close by the mill, "you may see it causing to rise and fall alternately the heavy pestles, that is to say, hammers or wooden foot-shaped blocks—for that name seems to agree better with the treading-work, as it were of the fullers—and so relieves them of the heaviest part of their labor" (sed graves illos, sive pistillos, sive malleos dicere mavis, vel certe pedes ligneos—nam hoc nomen saltuoso fullonum negotio magis videtur congruere—alternatim elevans atque deponens, gravi labore fullones absolvit. . .)63 63 Descriptio Monasterii Clarae-Vallensis, ed. Mabillon, II, 1690 cols. 1306-1309; and 4th ed., II:2, 1839, cols. 2529-33; reprinted in Migne, Patr. Lat., CLXXXV, 1879, cols. 569-73, and in extract in Mortet and Deschamps, II, 1929, 27-29. A translation of this text into French may be found in D'Arbois de Jubainville, 1858, 329-88; into English in Eales, 1912, 461-67. TRIP-HAMMERS WITH VERTICAL PESTLES There existed in the Middle Ages, as already mentioned, yet another pounding mechanism making use of camming action that cannot be overlooked in this context. It worked with vertical pestles rather than with recumbent hammers. Illustrations of these are found in the Mittelalterliche Hausbuch of about 1480,64 64 Schmithals and Klemm, 1958, 4. in several manuscripts of Leonardo da Vinci65 65 Das Mittelalterliche Hausbuch, fol. 36v. See Bossert and Storck 1912, pl. 40. and in the manuscript attributed to an anonymous Hussite engineer of around 1430 (fig. 456). Needham considers these vertical stamping mechanisms "as characteristically European as the recumbent tilt-hammer was Chinese."66 66 For detailed references to Leonardo's drawings of vertical crushing mechanisms see Needham, op. cit., 395, note d. This may be true, but there is no historical assurance whatsoever that in Europe the invention of the former preceded the adoption of the latter67 67 It has been generally overlooked in this discussion that the same anonymous Hussite engineer, who furnishes us with the earliest visual representation of a vertical pestle stamp provides us also with an illustration of a grain-crushing mechanism, operating with recumbent hammers (Munich, National Bibliothek, Ms. lat., fol. 17v; see Beck, op. cit. 278-80). I am drawing attention to this fact because there seems to be a tendency, in the literature on this subject, to think that in Europe the use of the vertical pestle stamp preceded that of mechanisms working with recumbent hammers, because of the erroneous view that the former is earlier attested in the visual arts. This would not only be a conclusion highly questionable in itself, but also one based on mistaken facts.

Hall, in an unpublished dissertation "The so-called `Manuscript of the Hussite Wars Engineer' and its Techological Milieu: A Study and Edition of Codex Latinus 197, Part 1," University of California, Los Angeles, 1971) showed conclusively that it is two manuscripts bound together.

Amongst the vertical medieval crushing devices listed by Needham, or anyone else as far as I can see, there is not a single one with pestles the shape of which could in any manner be compared with that of a hammer (malleus) or a foot-shaped member (vel certe pedes ligneos). A hammer, whether struck horizontally or vertically, hits its object on impact, in a position which places its longitudinal axis parallel to the surface that receives its blow. It can accomplish this only with the PLAN OF ST. GALL. MORTAR HOUSE. AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION 458.B 458.A 458.D 458.C PLAN.

In actual construction, we believe such details would have been resolved by experienced craftsmen. aid of a "foot-shaped" head piece lying at right angles to its longitudinal axis. In the vertical crushing mechanism, illustrated by the anonymous Hussite engineer (1472-78), the Hausbuch Master (ca. 1480) and Leonardo da Vinci (turn of the fifteenth to the sixteenth century), the pestles are pointed, i.e., pencil-shaped, and could not by any stretch of the imagination be interpreted as "hammer-" or "foot-shaped" instruments. There is no doubt in my mind that the pilae shown on the Plan of St. Gall must be interpreted as recumbent hammers. They have the shape of hammers, and the presence of a drum at the end, which lies opposite the head of the hammer, as well as their dimensions, allows for no other interpretation.67 67 It has been generally overlooked in this discussion that the same anonymous Hussite engineer, who furnishes us with the earliest visual representation of a vertical pestle stamp provides us also with an illustration of a grain-crushing mechanism, operating with recumbent hammers (Munich, National Bibliothek, Ms. lat., fol. 17v; see Beck, op. cit. 278-80). I am drawing attention to this fact because there seems to be a tendency, in the literature on this subject, to think that in Europe the use of the vertical pestle stamp preceded that of mechanisms working with recumbent hammers, because of the erroneous view that the former is earlier attested in the visual arts. This would not only be a conclusion highly questionable in itself, but also one based on mistaken facts. Both instruments portrayed and described by the Hussite Engineer are hand-operated and of rather light construction, made for home rather than industrial use, and therefore not really comparable to the heavy equipment shown on the Plan of St. Gall or described in the poetic thirteenth-century account of the waterworks of Clairvaux. The traditional date of Ms. Lat. 197, "ca. 1430" (Beck, 1899, 280; Needham, IV:2, 1965, 395; Horn, Journal of Medieval History I, 1975, 244) must be revised. Lynn White informs us that Bert A. Hall, in an unpublished dissertation "The so-called `Manuscript of the Hussite Wars Engineer' and its Techological Milieu: A Study and Edition of Codex Latinus 197, Part 1," University of California, Los Angeles, 1971) showed conclusively that it is two manuscripts bound together. They are from the hands of two engineers, neither of whom can be shown to have had any involvement in the Hussite Wars. Folios 1-28 can be dated to ca. 1472-1485, folios 29-48 to ca. 1485-1496. RECONSTRUCTION OF PILAE ON THE PLAN OF ST. GALL Using as a model the trip-hammers of the iron forge of Spechtshart's Flores Musicae (fig. 455), the trip-hammer of the monastic smithy of Compludo (fig. 457), and the modern example described by Meringer (fig. 453), we have reconstructed the mortars of the Plan of St. Gall as water-driven crushing hammers whose movement is controlled by the cogs of a cylindrical drum mounted directly upon the axis of a waterwheel (fig. 458). DIETARY IMPORTANCE OF CRUSHED GRAIN IN WESTERN EUROPE The amount of crushed grain used daily in a medieval monastery must have been considerable. A mixture of barley and oats, made into a kind of porridge or "pap" by the crushing action of the mortar was a chief item in the diet of the people of Western Europe prior to the introduction of the potato. The German word for this dish is mus, and in the monastery of St. Gall the use of this term, as 459.A PLAN OF ST. GALL. DRYING KILN. AUTHORS' RECONSTRUCTION [1:192] The shelter for the Drying Kiln is identical with those for the Mills and Mortars of the Plan. This house could have been the simplest kind of structure, perhaps even open-sided. Although the Drying Kiln would not develop temperature so high as those needed for baking, some fire hazard would have existed in a closed building; the Plan does not show either smoke exit or stack port for this facility. We reiterate that these service structures of the Plan are highly abstract; their purpose and siting were of foremost importance to the Plan's makers; their constructional details, secondary. Keller has pointed out,68 68 Keller, 1860, 48-49. was so prevalent that the monk Kero renders the Latin word cibus, i.e., "food," with the German word mus, and caenare, i.e., "to take one's supper," with the term abendmussen, i.e., "to sup on pap." Crushed grain was also one of the primary ingredients in the making of beer.69 69 See below, p. 259ff. V.15.4 THE DRYING KILN The drying apparatus in the "house in which the grain is parched" (locus ad torrendas annonas) need not detain us. The egg-shaped symbol in the center is obviously a furnace or oven enclosing a contained fire capable of producing the slow and even heat needed for parching. Its form is a hybrid between the ovoid corner fireplaces in the bedrooms of the higher-ranking monastic officials, and the baking ovens in the monastery's bake and brew houses.70 70 See below, pp. 254-57. The grid of squares around this furnace is the frame of a drying rack. Annonas should not be interpreted to refer exclusively to grain parched in preparation for brewing. The Drying Kiln was also the place where fruit from the abbey's orchards was dried for use during the winter months as a substitute for vegetables unavailable during this period. 459.B POMPEII. CARBONIZED LOAF OF BREAD The division of the loaf into equal-sized segments for easy distribution may have had some relevance for Benedict's later instruction that the monks' ration of bread be carefully and fairly weighed. 460. POMPEII. ROMAN ATRIUM HOUSE [redrawn after Kahler, 1960, 163, fig. 80] BAKING ESTABLISHMENT WITH LIVING QUARTERS The layout combining living quarters with a commercial and industrial establishment, shows Roman planing at its best. The forward part of the building is the traditional Roman atrium house—descendant of a long lineage of Near Eastern and Greco-Roman courtyard houses (cf. above, p. 6ff) which are as characteristically Mediterranean as the aisled and bay-divided timber hall, from which guest and service structures of the Plan descend, are Northern (cf. above, p. 23ff). On the street front, to left and right of the entrance (1) are two three-room shops (2, 3, 4; 5, 6, 7) unconnected with the interior. From the atrium (8) two stairs (9) lead to the balcony giving access to an upper tier of rooms. To the left and right are two cubicles (10, 11, 12, 13). The rear part of the house, accessible through a fore room (14), which under normal conditions would serve as tablinum, accommodates in an area of 8 × 10.2m (15) four mills of the type shown in fig. 441, with paved walking strips for the donkeys. Remaining rooms are: (16), a donkey stable with water trough; (17) a baking oven; (18) a room for kneading and shaping dough; (19) a room for cooling bread; (20) a bedroom for the mill slave, or kitchen (?). V. 16 FACILITIES FOR BAKING AND BREWING* * In the treatment that follows, I am greatly indebted to my editor, Lorna Price, whose experience in baking bread has brought substance and life to the discussion on this subject. Her interesting argument concerning the functional interdependence of baking and brewing appears to me a more persuasive explanation of the traditional medieval association of these two crafts under the same roof than I have found anywhere else in the literature. I regret that Lorna Price does not have equally rich experiences in the art of home brewing; otherwise my discussion of the brewing facilities would be less thin than it is in its present form. V.16.1 SYMBIOSIS OF BAKING &amp; BREWING In large medieval monasteries, the community's baking and brewing facilities were almost without exception installed in the same building. This is an intrinsically medieval arrangement that has no parallels in Greco-Roman life. Up to the time of the second Macedonian War (200 B.C.197 B.C.), Pliny informs us, the women of Rome used to bake their bread themselves in their homes,1 1 Pliny, Hist. Nat., book XVIII, chap 28, ed. Rackham, V, 1950, 107108: Pistores Romae non fuere ad Persicum usque bellum annis ab urbe condita super DLXXX. ipsi panem faciebant Quirites, mulierumque id opus maxime erat, sicut etiam nunc in plurimis gentium. as had been customary in the country since the remotest times, and continued to be among the peasants for ages to come. The flour was ground in mills operated by mules or by slaves.2 2 Cf. above, pp. 225-28. From 180 B.C. onward, however, as Rome began to develop into a megalopolis with multistory apartment houses, the millers began to usurp the task of baking, because the architecture of the city and the social conditions of their inhabitants no longer permitted each family to operate its own oven. Baking became a professional activity and its association with milling gave rise to the appearance of shops, where both of these operations were combined.3 3 This has interesting etymological implications. The term pistrinum in Classical Latin a designation for mill (from pinsere = to crush), became in Middle Latin the common term for bakery: cf. below, p. 253. A typical example of this industrial symbiosis is a house in Pompeii, the plan of which is shown in fig. 460. The forward half of this establishment, facing the street, is a typical Roman atrium house (1) with the rooms ranged peripherally around a central court. The rearward part consists of a court with millstones and baking troughs (2); a baking oven (3); a room for storing flour (4); a room for kneading and leavening dough (5); a shop for selling the finished product (6). This tradition of combining milling and baking in one and the same shop was not adopted by the Middle 460.X ROME. MUSEO CHIARAMONTI. MONUMENT OF P. NONIUS ZETHUS, OSTIA (LATE IST CENT.) [courtesy of the Archivo Fotografica dei Musei Vaticani] This large slab of marble (1.37 × .46 × .75m) imitates the form of a sarcophagus with two rows of conical sockets in the upper surface to receive incinerary urns. Reliefs illustrate the symbiosis of the trades of milling and baking in Roman life. In the center of a framed panel, the inscription, resolved of its abbreviations, reads: PUBLIUS NONIUS ZETHUS AUGUSTALIS FECIT SIBI ET NONIAE HILARAE CONLIBERTAE NONIAE PUBLI LIBERTAE PELAGIAE CONJUGI PUBLIUS NONIUS HERECLIO My colleague, Arthur E. Gordon, translates: Publius Nonius Zethus, an Augustalis, has made [this monument] for himself and nonia hilaria his fellow freedwoman, [and] Nonia Pelagia, freedwoman of Publius, his wife.—Publius Nonius Hereclio The donkey in the lyre-shaped wooden trace, the hourglass-shaped mill and its meta and catillus are typical in form (cf. figs. 441. B, 442); an assortment of standing containers of different capacities are doubtless measures for grain and flour, with additional containers hung on the wall. A sieve is also depicted, and two or three wooden battens used to level flour or grain to the rim of the container into which it was poured. The dating of the monument to the end of the 1st century A.D., Gordon informs me, is suggested by both style of writing and Zethus's title, "AUGUSTALIS," which in the late 1st or early 2nd century was changed to "SEXVIR" or "SEVIR AUGUSTALIS" (see Russel Meiggs, Roman Ostia, 1960, p. 217, and Wolfgang Helbig's Führer durch die öffentlichen Sammlungen Klassischer Altertümer in Rom, I, 1963, 245, No. 316.) Ages. Milling, by increasing its efficiency through water power, became a highly specialized professional function and a privilege jealously guarded by the feudatory who owned the land and the stream over which the mill was raised.4 4 Cf. above, p. 232, fig. 448A-C. Baking was dissociated from this craft and entered instead into a symbiosis with brewing—at least in all those cases where there was a need for the production of bread and beer in quantities that required using industrial techniques, as inevitably was so in a monastic community— and this association lead to the creation of a new architectural entity: the monastic bake and brew house. An impressive example of such a dual-purpose structure, dating from the end of the eleventh century, is portrayed on the plan of the waterworks of Christchurch Monastery (fig. 461), drawn up by the engineer Wibert around 1165.5 5 For a reproduction of the entire plan of Wibert, see I, 70, fig. 52; for the history of the plan, the literature quoted above, I, 69, notes 16-17. Measuring approximately 40 by 170 feet (its foundations can still be traced6 6 See Willis, 1868, 149-52; and especially the plan of Christchurch Monastery as reconstructed by Willis, reproduced between pages 198 and 199. ), this installation was more than twice the length of the Monks' Bake and Brew House on the Plan of St. Gall (fig. 462). Inscriptions tell us that half of the building was used for brewing (bracium) and the other half for baking (pistrinum). Precisely when the association of these two crafts came about historically I do not know. On the Plan of St. Gall it is an accomplished fact. The paradigmatic character of the Plan may well have contributed greatly to the adoption and continuance of this architectural solution in later monastic planning. V.16.2 THE NEED TO MAINTAIN AN ACTIVE YEAST CULTURE There are some functional requirements shared by brewing and baking that could readily dictate that facilities for the two tasks be installed beneath the same roof. Both processes depend on the maintenance of an active yeast culture and the successful completion of a yeast cycle, each of which requires a temperature that can be held above 75°F and by consequence, an architectural ambient capable of furnishing this condition. Yeast is the indispensable ingredient without which the bread could not rise nor the beer ferment. The genesis and maintenance of a yeast culture, or "sponge," must have been a primary consideration and cause for concern among those whose duty it was to furnish the daily bread requirements of the monastery. When the monastery population of St. Gall was at full complement, nearly 300 loaves daily were to be produced by the monks' bakery.7 7 For justification of this figure, see below, p. 259 and I, 342. In today's terms, the amount of yeast required to cause such a bulk of flour to rise must have been considerable—the monks did not have modern dried yeast, but must have had to maintain and daily replenish a potent yeast culture and reserve in a good-sized crock, cauldron or bin, to assure the rising of the new bread from one day to the next. The life of a yeast culture is tenacious enough, for the organism survives even long-term freezing, but it is quiescent below lukewarm temperatures, and will not instigate fermentation in beer, nor cause bread to rise steadily at temperatures much below 80°F. The oven in the bake house provided that continuance of temperature. Its temperature rose and declined with the rhythm of the baking cycle but it was never cold so long as the requirements of the full community demanded fresh bread daily. For this reason, the Bake and Brew House maintained a rather predictable range of temperature throughout the year and thus afforded a basic precondition for the production of both bread and beer. To effectively use a large oven such as the one in the monks' bakery presupposes that it was warmed, even between firings, by a small banked fire in its interior. Were it allowed to cool completely and then be reheated rapidly in daily succession, only a short time would pass before the oven and its chimney stack would crack and disintegrate from the effects of too-rapid expansion and contraction (thermal shock). On the other hand, by being prewarmed the oven could be heated to temperatures high enough to bake bread in a relatively short time (at a probable internal loading-time heat of 700°F) without straining its thermal tolerance. Keeping the fire alive from one baking to the next would have made it possible to "control" the air temperature of the Monks' Bake and Brew House merely as a side effect of properly tending a large oven in daily use, thus maintaining an ambient in which a successful brewing fermentation cycle could be virtually assured all year round. V.16.3 DUPLICATION OF DESIGN AND EQUIPMENT SUBTLE DIFFERENTIATIONS IN DESIGN In the monastery shown on the Plan of St. Gall there are three bake and brew houses, one for the Monks, one for the House for Distinguished Guests and one for the House for Pilgrims and Paupers (figs. 462-464). The maker of the Plan was sensitive to varying demands upon the baking and brewing facilities in the St. Gall community. While the layout, design, and equipment of the three bake and brew houses of the Plan are virtually identical, planned variations exist in both size and details, in order to accommodate different traffic through each installation. The differences are subtle yet persuasively illustrate the compositional flexibility of this house type and its ability to adapt with ease to specific needs by an addition to the principal space of one or several peripheral rooms.

PLAN OF WATERWORKS FOR CHRISTCHURCH MONASTERY DRAWN ABOUT 1165 DETAIL SHOWING MONKS' BAKE AND BREW HOUSE [by courtesy of the Trustees of Trinity College Library, Cambridge University] The drafters of the Plan of St. Gall considered the association of the crafts of baking and brewing to be both ideal and a practical necessity. The Christchurch drawing demonstrates, together with many other documentary and archaeological sources, that this association became a standard trait of monastic architecture in the ensuing two centuries. The plan of the waterworks of Christchurch, Canterbury, shows the conventual buildings in the state they attained under Bishop Lanfranc (d. 1089), after the Saxon church and monastery were destroyed by fire in 1067. The bake and brewhouse of this new monastery was built in the large open court (CURIA), to the north of the claustral compound. It was a large rectangular building, 40 feet wide and 170 feet long, running with axis parallel to the precinct and city walls bounding the monastery to the north at a distance of 70 and 100 feet respectively. The building was divided transversely by an internal wall into two unequal sections; the western and larger of these, covering a surface area of 40 by 110 feet served as Brewhouse (BRACINUM), the eastern and smaller one, measuring 40 by 60 feet, as Bakery (PISTRINUM). A few feet to the east and co-axial with the bake and brewhouse, stood a granary (GRANARIUM) which, because of its small dimensions, (40 by 40 feet) can only have been a brewers' granary; it is in fact thus referred to in documents of 1803 and 1313 (granarium in bracino, pro novo bracino cum granario; cf. Willis, 1968, 150). Christchurch Monastery had only one bake and brewhouse. The Plan of St. Gall shows three (figs. 461-463) but the surface area of the Canterbury facility (6,800 square feet) almost equals the combined surface area of the brewhouses of the Plan (7,120 square feet). * The entire plan of Canterbury is shown in vol. I, 70, fig. 52.A. only one aisle attached to its main space, was at 1,350 square feet (figs. 463 and 392-393) the smallest of the installations, serving a constant but modest number of travellers who received from the monks a fare almost as simple as their own. On the other hand, the Bake and Brew House for Distinguished Guests (figs. 396, 400, and 464), although only used occasionally, was at 2,636 square feet the same size as the Bake and Brew House of the Monks. This provision of a seemingly too-large space may be accounted for by the recognition that a large progress of nobles and their retainers might at times approach the number of resident monks, with the added complication of more sophisticated dietary demands of the worldly. The baking and brewing facilities of the two guest houses, for example, include cooking facilities, an acknowledgement of the differing dietary requirements for guests and monks. Thus, it is seen that the need for three separate bake and brew houses in the monastery was unavoidable, because of the different diets involved for the three classes of men—fuedal lords, paupers and monks—who were to be served by these separate facilities. Differentiation in the type and quality of bread is well attested.8 8 See Abbot Adalhard's directives concerning the various types of bread, below, pp. 257-58. For other dietary distinctions, especially, concerning the consumption of meat, see I, 275-79; and below, p. 264. It is not unreasonable to assume that similar distinctions entailed the production of different types and qualities of beer. In an article dealing with hops and its history Charles Dimont points out that "it was the monks who began the classification of beer by its strength into prima, secunda, and tertia (which simplified into the categories `X', `XX' and `XXX', are used even today) and that this tradition of producing different qualities of beer was carried on in the universities and colleges which brewed their own specialities such as `Chancellor', `Audit', and `Archdeacon'."9 9 Dimont, 1954, 470; (unfortunately without reference to any historical sources); the article was brought to my attention by Lynn White. The Bake and Brew House for Distinguished Guests is provided with additional space, apparently for storage, in the form of two lean-to's on the entrance side. Despite the larger numbers it served, the oven of this installation is no larger than that in the Bake and Brew House for Pilgrims and Paupers; at 7½ feet it is smaller in diameter by one fourth than the monks' oven (dia. = 10 feet), but therefore more quickly and easily brought to baking heat after standing cold during periods of disuse. The relation in the subordinate installations of baking to brewing facilities is such that the ovens could have served to control the temperatures for successful brewing, as was likely done in the Monks' Bake and Brew House, a discussion of which follows. V.16.4 THE MONKS' BAKE AND BREW HOUSE We have already dealt with the bake and brew houses for the pilgrims and paupers and for the distinguished guests in connection with the two houses to which they are attached.10 10 For the Bake and Brew House of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers, see above, pp. 151-53; for that of the Distinguished Guests, above pp. 151-53. The Monks' Bake and Brew House, largest of the three, remains to be discussed (fig. 462). The Monks' Bake and Brew House lies south of the Monks' Kitchen and is connected to the latter by a covered passageway that allowed the monks to go back and forth between these two installations without violating the terms of claustral seclusion. The House is 42½ feet wide and 75 feet long. It has an aisle on each long side and a narrow lean-to at the east end. The general purpose of the building is explained, surprisingly in unspecific terms, by a hexameter running parallel to the entrance side: Here the brothers' viands shall be taken care of with thoughtful concern (hic uictus fr?m? cura tract &amp; tur honesta). The aisle that faces the Kitchen contains two "bedrooms for the servants" (uernarum repausationes). Uerna, a term that appears only in this place on the Plan, is probably, as Leclercq suggests,11 11 Leclercq, in Cabrol-Leclercq, 1924, col. 99. In classical Latin verna means "homeborn slave." the name for a serf, who because he was born on the monastic domain and had been attached to the monastery since birth, was treated, if not as a monk, at least as a brother of inferior rank rather than as a domestic. THE BAKERY The term PISTRINUM A small vestibule left between the two bedrooms of the servants gives access to the "brothers' bakery" (pistrin? fr?m?). It occupies the eastern half of the house and its center space forms an area 22½ feet wide and 32½ feet long. It should be mentioned in this context that the term pistrinum is used exclusively as a designation for "bakery" on the Plan of St. Gall, and never in the sense of "mill," its original classical meaning.12 12 See Lewis and Short, A Latin Dictionary, sub verbo. The equipment with which the spaces that carry this designation on the Plan are furnished offers the proof (figs. 462-464). Hildemar, who touches on the matter of bake houses in his commentary of chapter 66 of the Rule, makes some interesting etymological comments about this term: "Pistrinum," he says, "is the equivalent of pilistrinum, because in the early days people used to crush grain with the aid of a pestle (pilo) for which reason the ancients did not call them grinders (molitores) but crushers (pistores), i.e., people engaged in the crushing of grain (pinsores) for there were no mill stones (molae) in use at that time, but grain was crushed with pestles."13 13 "Pistrinum quasi pilistrinum, quia pilo antea tundebant granum; unde et apud veteres non molitores sed pistores dicti sunt; quasi pinsores a pinsendis granis frumenti; molae enim usus nondum erat, sed granum pilo pinsebant," (Expositio Hildemari, ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 607-608). PLAN OF ST. GALL. MONKS' BAKE AND BREW HOUSE 462.X THE SYMBIOTIC SCHEME IN PLANNING The efficiency internal to the Plan of St. Gall is nowhere better demonstrated than in the relationships among the Brewers' Granary, Mortars, Mills, Drying Kiln, and Monks' Bake and Brewhouse. The traffic patterns demonstrate with what economy of movement raw material, grain—bulky and heavy even after threshing—could be moved from the Brewers' Granary to facilities where it was further refined, and finally into the Brewhouse where the end product, beer, was produced. Similar efficiency of movement existed between the Mill, the Bakehouse, and the Monks' Kitchen. However, planning for isolation of the monks' sanctum takes precedence over convenience where monastery met the world. See fig. 463.X, p. 256. SITE PLAN The makers of the Plan devoted extraordinary attention to the visual detail and verbal instruction for this house, for it lay, in a most immediate sense, at the physical heart of the monastic complex, as the Church lay at its spiritual heart. The technology of this house is among the most highly elaborated and least abstract of all facilities of the Plan that existed to support daily life in the monastery. The close proximity of facilities for processing raw material (grain), refining it (Drying Kiln, 29; Mortar; 28; Mill, 27), and using it in the Monks' Bake and Brewhouse assumes intense daily use—transporting sheaved grain, sacking threshed grain, carrying it after processing to bakery or brewery, carrying end products, new bread and new beer, to their destinations. All the starting points and termini for these processes are found in a very small area relative to the size of the whole site of the Plan. Each day some major part of the cycles and processes for brewing and baking would be set in motion by monks assigned to such chores. The traffic in numbers of men, to say nothing of their burdens—grain, buckets, barrows, sacks, baked bread—achieved a density of use and compaction nowhere else found in the Plan. The planning of the associated facilities would therefore be highly specific, with little assumed and nothing left to improvisation that would affect efficiency adversely. In this small area of the overall site, the makers of the Plan demonstrated their thoroughness and ingenuity as administrators and architects. The term is fascinating, since its shifting values reflect the entire history of grain preparation from the mortar-and-pestle stage to the milling stage, and thence by an associative leap (because bread was often baked near the mill) from the building in which grain was ground into flour to the facility where bread was baked. Layout and equipment The principal piece of equipment in the Bake House is the large oven (caminus) which is installed in the southern aisle of the house directly opposite the entrance. The oven has a diameter of 10 feet, and is serviced from the main room of the bakery. This room is furnished with a continuous course of tables or shelves running in a U-formation around three of its four walls. The total linear length of this shelf is 62½ feet. Its depth is 2½ feet. Thus it provides an ample general work space that could have been used variously for any number of purposes in the course of breadmaking. Next to the oven and in the same aisle with it there is a trough (alueolus) 12½ feet long and 2½ feet wide. The space under the lean-to at the east end of the house serves as a "storage bin for flour" (repositio farinae); this area is 7½ feet wide and 30 feet long. The Plan shows no doors giving access either to the flour bin or to the room with the kneading trough—one of the few genuine oversights on the Plan.14 14 Cf. our chapter on "Omissions and Oversights," I, 68. In the axis of the center space, and almost equidistant from their edges to the shelves that line the room on three sides, are two rectangles that together form an area 6¼ feet wide and 10 feet long. A similar but smaller object is found in the corresponding space in the bakery of the House for Distinguished Guests. In the bakery of the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers, however, this space is occupied by the kitchen stove15 15 See above, pp. 151-53. that seemingly displaces to the brew house an oblong surface that probably corresponds to the same pieces found in the center of the bakeries of the other two houses. Unfortunately the Plan does not provide any explanatory titles that would enable us to identify the nature, construction, or function of the objects designated by these rectangles. This is somewhat surprising because similar objects situated in the outer aisles are clearly identified with titles that not only explain their shape or form (alueolus, trough) but also their function (locus conspergendi, the place where the dough is mixed; and ineruendae pastae locus, the place where flour is mingled [with water].) There is no doubt that the large rectangles in the side aisles of the bake house were the troughs in which the dough was first mixed. Good baking practice would require that the yeast sponge be added to the dough at this beginning stage, and it is quite possible that after being vigorously mixed, it was likewise here that the dough was allowed to enter its first stage of rising. The warmth of the enclosure near the oven, already fired by a considerable heat, would significantly aid the rising process in the large mass of dough. To convert the bulk of dough into a multitude of loaves required a different setting: large surfaces sprinkled with flour where the mass could be broken up, kneaded, divided and weighed into uniform batches, and shaped into loaves. All these purposes could have been served by the large rectangular surfaces in the center of the bakery, or, if these rectangles were actually troughs, the work could have been done on the shelves that lined the central space on three sides. After the loaves were shaped and before they were placed in the oven for baking, they probably went through a second stage of rising.16 16 While it may not be possible to reconstruct exactly the techniques the monks used in baking, their methods can have varied but slightly from those still in use today. For instance, bread baked in small batches is commonly kneaded after the dough is mixed, but a vigorous mixing can replace that initial kneading. It is not even necessary that vigorously mixed dough rise twice, although allowing it to do so assures a finertextured bread. Any basic variations in the monks' baking methods probably arose from considerations due to the quantity of bread they made, rather than from any special mysteries inherent in breadmaking. The reconstruction of the equipment used in baking poses no problem. We have already discussed the oven together with other heating units shown on the Plan.17 17 See above, pp. 138-39. Their form was established early and until very recent times did not undergo any significant changes. The same can also probably be said about bakers' troughs, a good medieval example of which is shown in figure 388. I am inclined to believe that in medieval ovens, the firing and baking chamber were one and the same unit—as they were still in the earlier decades of this century in the bakeries of the German village where I spent my childhood. There the ovens were heated by wood, as was done in the Middle Ages. When the right temperature was reached, the coals were raked out to make room for the loaves, and the bread was baked as the oven temperature entered its descending cycle. The daily allowance of bread The daily ration of bread allowed to each monk was fixed by St. Benedict: Let a weighed pound of bread suffice for the day, whether there be one meal only, or both dinner and supper. . . . But if their work chance to be heavier, the abbot shall have the choice and power, should it be expedient, to increase this allowance.18 18 "Panis libra una propensa sufficiat in die, siue una sit refectio siue prandii et cenae. . . . Quod si labor forte factus fuerit maior, in arbitrio et potestate abbatis erit, si expediat, aliquid augere." (Benedicti regula, chap. 39, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 99-100; ed. McCann, 1952, 94-96; ed. Steidle, 1952, 234-36). The qualifying adjective propensa of panis libra una requires comment. Delatte, 1913, 309 and McCann, 1952, 95 translate "a good pound of weight;" Steidle, 1952, 234, more convincingly "a well weighed pound of bread." Hildemar who is closer by eleven hundred years to the source explains the adjective as follows: Propensa, i.e., praeponderata, i.e., mensurata (Expositio Hildemari, ed. Mittermüller, 1880, 437, commentary to chapter 39 of the Rule). What St. Benedict wished to convey accordingly—obviously in the interest of equity—would be that the quantity of dough that went into the making of a loaf of bread should be measured on the scales rather than left to the guess of the baker. Whether this was done in the dough stage or after baking will have to remain a moot question. At Monte Cassino, during the abbacy of Theodomar (for source see the following note) bread was baked in four-pound loaves, and accordingly would have to be cut into serviceable pieces after baking. This could even have been done in the refectory before the bread was distributed and may indeed have been the simplest and most logical way of doing it, since even the one-pound loaves would have to have been cut into smaller portions on the days when several meals were served, and the bread was eaten in successive stages. 464. PLAN OF ST. GALL. KITCHEN, BAKE &amp; BREWHOUSE FOR DISTINGUISHED GUESTS 463.X SITE PLAN 463. PLAN OF ST. GALL. KITCHEN, BAKE &amp; BREWHOUSE FOR PILGRIMS AND PAUPERS Of three baking and brewing houses on the Plan, that of the monks is largest; but it includes, besides purely functional space, two rooms for servants' sleeping quarters and a lean-to for storing flour. Servants attached to houses for pilgrims and distinguished guests lodged in their respective main buildings, not in the bakeries. The size of the Bake and Brewhouse for Distinguished Guests is augmented by its separate larder and kitchen; but when areas used solely for baking and brewing are compared, it will be seen that the differences in size among the three like facilities are minor. The essential replication of facilities for baking and brewing, both in function and in the layout of each, apparently marks both traditional juxtapositions and recognition of the combined bakery-brewery plan to adapt to efficient service for a widely varying number of people—on the Plan from as few as twelve pilgrims to as many as 300 monks if the population ever reached its full complement. Routes between grain supply (Mills, Mortars, Brewers' Granary) and breweries of pilgrims' and guests' facilities are highly circuitous and lie right through the western paradise of the Church. But traffic of burdened servants in this most public area of the site would hardly have presented an interruption. The sacrifice in efficiency in this pattern was regained in maintaining the desired segregation between worldly and claustral activities. e. PORTER'S LODGING f.

DRYING KILN Charlemagne, in trying to establish the exact weight of this pound, learned from Abbot Theodomar of Monte Cassino that in St. Benedict's own monastery bread was baked in loaves weighing four pounds and divisible into four quarter sections, weighing a pound each: "This weight," the Abbot assures the emperor, "just as it was instituted by the Father himself, is found at this place."19 19 Theodomari epistula ad Karolum, chap. 4, ed. Hallinger and Wegener, Corp. con. mon., I, 1963, 162-163; "Direximus quoque pondo quattuor librarum, ad cuius aequalitatem ponderis panis debeat fieri, qui in quaternas quadras singularum librarum iuxta sacrae textum regule possit diuidi. Quod pondus, sicut ab ipso padre est institutum, in hoc est loco repertum." I am puzzled by Semmler's interpreting this difficult passage to mean that in Monte Cassino, the daily ration of bread, at the time of Abbot Theodomar, was four pounds per monk (Semmler, 1958, 278). Cf. the remark of Jacques Winandy on this subject: "Comme il apparait a simple lecture, le pain de quatre livres devrait être divisé en quatre parts égales." (Winandy, 1938, 281). The Roman pound was the equivalent of 326 grams. Charlemagne increased it by one fourth of its former size, sometime before 779, which brought it up an equivalent of 406 grams.20 20 On the difference between the Roman and Carolingian pound see Guérard, I, 1844, 125ff and 192. The Synod of 817 defined the weight of one pound as corresponding to 30 solidi of a value equivalent to 12 denarii.21 21 Synodae secundae decr. auth., chap. 22, ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 478: Ut libra panis triginta solidis per duodecim denarios ponderetur. Adalhard distinguishes between "bread of mixed grain" (panos de mixtura factos) and that "made of wheat or spelt" (de frumento uel spelta). The former was issued to the paupers; the latter, to visiting vassals and clergymen on pilgrimage.22 22 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 2, ed. Semmler, Corp. con. mon., I, 1963, 372, and translation III, 105. Ekkehart, in his Benedictiones ad mensas, makes reference to a wide variety of bread: to "cakes" (torta), "moon-shaped bread" (panem lunatem), "salted bread" (panem cum sale mixtum), "bread leavened with egg" (panem per oua leuatum) and "bread leavened with dredge" (panem de fece leuatum), "bread made of `spelt' " (de spelta), "rye" (triticeum panem), "wheat" (panem sigalinum), "barley" (ordea panis), "oat" (panis avena), "fresh bread" and "old bread" (panis noviter cocti and recens coctus panis), "warm bread" and "cold bread" (calidi panes and gelidus panis), and lastly, the "morsels and crumbs" (fragmina panum) left over from each meal. (Benedictiones ad mensas, lines 6-20. See Liber benedictionum Ekkeharts IV, ed. Egli, 1909, 281-84 and Schulz, 1941. He gives a complete account of the daily and yearly bread consumption in the monastery of Corbie, specifies the quantity of flour needed to produce that volume, PLAN OF ST. GALL. MONKS' BAKE AND BREW HOUSE. AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION 465.B LONGITUDINAL SECTION 465.A PLAN This facility belongs to the third variant of the building type from which the guest and service buildings of the Plan descend: a central hall with peripheral spaces on three sides (see above, pp. 178ff). The partition wall in the central hall, dividing Bakery from Brewery, was not structural; in the Bake and Brewhouses for Pilgrims, and for Distinguished Guests, such a divider does not appear. In the Monks' Bake and Brewhouse the dividing wall allots more floor space to the Bakery, but in fact the work areas for each space were virtually identical. The location of the partition wall here in effect clears between entryway and oven; the task of loading or unloading loaves could go on without encumbering the bakers' working space. Certain doors connecting work and storage areas, not shown on the Plan itself, are provided here. and the sources from which it was obtained.23 23 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 3, ed. cit., 375ff and III, 106. He cautions the "keeper of the bread" (custos panis) to make allowance for the yearly fluctuations in the number of mouths to be fed by providing for a reasonable surplus of flour in order not to be caught with a shortage, and he admonishes him at the same time not to bake more for the brothers than is needed, "lest what is left over should get too hard." If this were nevertheless allowed to happen, the old bread would have to be thrown away, and the supply of bread replenished.24 24 Ibid., 377, and III, 107. A single cycle of firing and baking If we presume that St. Benedict's allowance of a daily pound of bread for each monk applied to the monastery's serfs as well, the monks' bakery on the Plan of St. Gall would have to have been capable of producing 250 to 270 pounds of bread per day.25 25 For the rationale behind this figure see I, 342. An analysis of the dimensions of its oven and the amount of space required for this output discloses that this volume of bread could be produced in a single cycle of firing and baking.26 26 I am relying on the calculation of my friend Thomas Tedrick who assures me that an oven 10 feet in diameter on the inside is capable of baking 356 loaves of bread, each weighing one pound, in a single process of baking if all available space is utilized and the loaves, after their expansion during baking, are allowed to touch each other. After some of the oven's space has been subtracted for wall thickness and more for a narrow margin of space to be allowed between the loaves to prevent them from sticking together, the dimensions of this oven turn out to have been planned to meet exactly the daily baking requirements of the monks and serfs of the monastery shown on the Plan of St. Gall. A passage in Ekkehart's Casus sancti Galli, which has consistently been misconstrued, reads that the monastery of St. Gall had an oven (clibanum) capable of baking a thousand loaves of bread at once and a bronze kettle (lebete eneo) and drying kiln (tarra avenis) capable of holding one hundred bushels of oats.27 27 First quoted as a fact by Keller (1844, 14), but without exact reference to the place and context in which this statement occurred, and subsequently repeated by scholars who failed to look up the original source. Even Bikel (1914, 119) is guilty of that error by omission. This is not a statement of fact, but a passage in a speech by Abbot Solomon III, which Ekkehart himself refers to as "boastful" and "fraudulent."28 28 See Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, chap. 13, ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 51-54; ed. Helbling, 1958, 40. THE BREWERY From Babylon and Egypt to St. Columban Beer is a malted beverage that was brewed in Babylon and Egypt from primordial times29 29 For brewing in the ancient Near East and in Egypt, see Arnold, 1911; Lutz, 1922; Huber, 1926, and Bücheler, 1934. For brewing in the early Middle Ages, see Heyne, II, 1901, 334. For brewing in St. Gall, see Knoblauch, 1926; and Joseph Müller, 1941. An informative article on domestic brewing and brewing utensils in English, by Allan Jobson, will be found in Country Life, March 4, 1949; for pictures of a reconstructed medieval brewhouse and its equipment, see G. Bernard Wood in Country Life, July 2, 1953. Of great interest in this context is the ancient Brewery of Queen's College Oxford, a description of which will be found in the article "Brewing" of the Encyclopedia Britannica. but it was held in low esteem by the wine-loving Greeks and Romans, and because of this deeply rooted cultural aversion made no imprint whatsoever on early monastic life, from the literature of which the terms cerevisa or celia are wholly absent. The drink acquired significance, however, as monachism spread into the north and west of Europe where beer has been a traditional beverage since the remotest times and where wine was as yet not made in sufficient quantities to take care of all of the needs of the monks. Pliny describes caelia, cerea and cerevisia as words of Celtic origin denoting beverages drunk in his days in Spain and in Gaul and remarks that its froth was used by the women of these countries as a cosmetic for the face.30 30 Pliny, Hist. Nat., Book XXII, chap. 82; ed. W. H. S. Jones (The Loeb Classical Library), VI London-Harvard, 1951, 408-411. The terms do not occur at any place in the Rule of St. Benedict. The earliest evidence of the consumption of beer in a monastic context, to the best of my knowledge, is a passage in the Life of St. Columban, (543-615) written by the monk Jonas of Bobbio (ca. 665) which relates that in the days of Columban, beer was served in the refectory of the monastery of Luxeuil (founded by St. Columban ca. 590). In this account cervisia is referred to as a beverage "which is boiled down from the juice of corn or barley, and which is used in preference to other beverages by all the nations in the world—except the Scottish and barbarian nations who inhabit the ocean—that is in Gaul, Britain, Ireland, Germany and the other nations, who do not deviate from the custom of the above."31 31 Vita Sancti Columbani Abbatis, auctore Jona Monacho Bobiensi, ed. Jean Mabillon, Acta Sanctorum Ordinis S. Benedicti, 3rd ed., Paris, 1935, 16: "Cum hora refectionis appropinquaret, &amp; minister Refectorii cervisiam administrare conaretur (quae ex frumenti vel hordei succo excoquitur, quamque prae ceteris in orbe terrarum gentibus praeter Scoticas &amp; Barbaras gentes quae Oceanum involunt usituntur, idest Gallia, Britannia, Hibernia, Germania, caeteraeque qua ab eorum moribus non desciscunt) vas quod tybrum nuncupant, minister ad cellarium deportat, &amp; ante was quo cervisia condita erat apponit . . ." PLAN OF ST. GALL. MONKS' BAKE AND BREW HOUSE. AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION 465.D LONGITUDINAL SECTION 465.C NORTH ELEVATION The length of the main space of the Monks' Bake and Brew house, 67½ feet, suggests that its roof was carried by seven trusses dividing the interior into six bays, each 11 feet deep. Such a division would have been in full accord with the asymmetrical location of the entrance. The width of the center space, 22½ feet is conventional. Although louvers are not marked on the Plan, their presence is postulated for purely functional reasons (need for air, light and a means for smoke to escape). Whether the lean-to at the eastern end of the building terminated on tie beam level or reached all the way up to the ridge of the roof, is impossible to say. We have kept it low, because we saw no functional need to take it higher. Basic procedures in the making of beer Beer is brewed in a number of different ways, resulting in a variety of different brews. The manufacture of all of them has certain basic steps in common: 1. First, grain, usually barley, is "malted," i.e., allowed to steep in water until it begins to germinate, and starches in the grain undergo chemical changes that produce sugars. 2. Then the malted grain is mashed and infused in gradually heated water, the temperatures of which are raised in stages to 165° or 175°F. This heating arrests the germination of the malted grain and results in a liquid known as wort (sweet wort) which retains the natural sugars and enzymes generated by infusion. 3. After completion of the infusion process the wort is transferred to a kettle and to it is added the blossoms of hops that give beer its characteristic aroma and flavor. This mixture of wort and hops (hopped wort) is boiled for about two hours. 4. After this operation is completed the liquid is cleansed by straining out the hops and sediments, and filtered into a cask or trough for cooling. At this point the yeast is added to the wort and fermentation begins. Beer may be fermented in a variety of ways, but until relatively recently, the process favored on the Continent was that of top fermentation, in which the yeast rises to the top of the fermentation vat and is there skimmed off when fermentation is complete. Some beers can be drunk immediately after fermentation is complete. Others, particularly those made by top fermentation are stored in casks from two or three weeks to six months. During the storage period the beer brightens and becomes charged with carbon dioxide. Beer fermented in this way is stored in an ambient of 58°-70°F, a condition entirely consonant with temperatures that could be maintained both in the Monks' Brew House where fermentation of the beer was instigated, and in the great cellar used for wine and beer storage (see I, 292-307). Layout and equipment On the Plan of St. Gall, the monks' brewery lies in the western half of the Monks' Bake and Brew House (fig. 462). It covers the same area as the bakery, but has no lean-to on the narrow end of the building. The space in which it is accommodated is marked by the title "Here let the beer for the brothers be brewed" (hic fr??bus conficiat ceruisa). It is reached from the monks' bakery and has no separate access from the outside. The monks' brewery is furnished with all the equipment needed in brewing: a stove with four ranges for heating water and boiling wort with hops. The stove is identical in design with the large stove in the Monks' Kitchen.32 32 On the Kitchen, see I, 284-88. Around that stove four round objects are shown—vats or cauldrons, no doubt, wherein the grain was steeped for malting, and infusion was done. These could have consisted either of simple wooden tubs, or of heatable cauldrons or of a combination of both, and may have been in shape or construction like any of those shown in figure 387 and 390. The south aisle of the brew house serves as a cooler. It is furnished with two troughs and a vat, explained by the inscription "Here let beer be cooled" (hic col&amp;ur celia). Here the yeast was added to the worted liquid and fermentation began. From the cooling troughs unquestionably the beer was moved to casks in the cellar, and allowed to finish fermenting and clearing, before it was brought to the table. Replacement of wine by beer in ratio of 1:2 We have already drawn attention to the fact that wine was the traditional monastic beverage, beer only a substitute, and that a ruling of the Synod of 816 directed that if shortages in wine had to be made up for by beer, this should be done in the ratio of 1:2.33 33 On the directive that wine should replace beer at the ratio of 1:2 see I, 303. Therefore, if such an emergency arose, beer would have had to be available in considerable quantities. Abbot Adalhard of Corbie allows each visiting pauper a ration of 1.4 liters of beer per day.34 34 On the ration of beer allowed to the paupers by Adalhard, see I, 299-303 and III, 105. If this same amount were issued to the monks and the serfs of the monastery, this would mean that the monastery shown on the Plan of St. Gall issued 350 to 400 liters a day. Over a period of time, this practice would have required storing a considerable volume of beer. Unlike wine, beer is not a seasonal product, but can be manufactured continuously, and in the monastery it probably was manufactured continuously, like the bread in the nearby bakery. Today the brewing of beer is almost exclusively in the hands of commercial firms. Throughout the major part of the Middle Ages it was a small-scale domestic operation. Before the twelfth and thirteenth centuries when brewing first emerged as a commercial venture, the monastery was probably the only institution where beer was manufactured on anything like a commercial scale. Use of hops as a flavoring agent The explanatory titles of the various bake and brew houses of the Plan of St. Gall contain no direct reference to the use of hops as a flavoring agent in the production of beer, but it is quite possible that a tacit allusion to this plant is hidden in the second half of the title which defines the Brewers' Granary as the place "where the cleansed grain is kept and where what goes to make beer is prepared" (granarium ubi mandat? frumentum seru&amp;ur &amp; qd ad ceruis? praeparatur).35 35 On the Brewers' Granary, see above, pp. 222-23. This granary is ideally located, in the middle between the Monk's Brewhouse and their Drying Kiln—which in addition to serving as a facility for parching fruit and grapes, could also have performed the function of a monastic oast house.36 36 On the Drying Kiln, see above, p. 248. PLAN OF ST. GALL. MONKS' BAKE AND BREW HOUSE. AUTHORS' RECONSTRUCTION 465.F WEST ELEVATION 465.E EAST ELEVATION At the western end of the building the aisles and the center space terminated in a straight line. Under such conditions, the design of the terminal truss, together with all of its secondary members and infillings, would have been visible for the entire width and height of the structure. At the opposite end, because of the presence of a lean-to, only the triangular wall section above tie beams could have been exposed to the exterior. The design of these two sides of the building has a close parallel in the Physicians' House (figs. 413.C and D) except for the different placement of the entrance. There is sufficient evidence to make it clear that the hopping of beer was in the early Middle Ages a widespread monastic practice north of the Alps. In his Administrative Directives of A.D. 822 Abbot Adalhard of Corbie addresses himself in detail to the procedures that should control the tithing of hops and their distribution among the various monastic officials placed in charge of brewing.37 37 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 5, 25; ed. Semmler, Corp. Cons. mon., I, 1963, 400 and translation, III, 117. He makes it a point to exempt the miller from making malt or from growing hops (nec braces faciendo nec humulonem) because of the weight of his other duties.38 38 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 3, 12; ed. cit., 379; and translation, III, 107. Ural-Altaic origins The origins of the use of hops as a constituent ingredient in brewing is an intriguing literary and linguistic subject. E. L. Davis, and others before him, have drawn attention to the importance given to hops in the folklore of Finland and the Caucasus region and believed to reflect a cultural heritage of great antiquity. They thus inferred that hops were used as an ingredient for beer in the northeast and east of Europe long before this practice was introduced in western Europe.39 39 E. L. Davis, 1956, unpublished thesis, Dept. of Botany, Washington University. Numerous references to the use of hops in brewing beer are found in the Finnish epic poem Kalevala, a typical example of which, as rendered in the prose edition by Francis Peabody Magoun, Jr., 1963, 137, reads as follows: "Then the mistress of North Farm, when she heard about the origin of beer, got a big tub of water, a new wooden tub half full, with barley enough in it and a lot of hop pods. She began to boil the beer, to prepare the strong liquor in the new wooden cask, in the birchwood keg." The Kalevala, song 20, lines 421-26 (The Finnish word for "hops" used in the Kalevala is humala). On the early west European history of hop cultivation, its diffusion from the territory of the Franks to the territory of the Bajuvarians and other Germanic tribes, see Victor Hehn, 1874, 411ff (or any of the many later editions of this important work). The subject is also discussed in Heyne, II, 1901, 72, and 341. To the kindness of Lynn White I owe the knowledge of the following more recent literature: Steiger, 1954 (a well-documented linguistic study); Ditmond, 1954 (good, but exasperating reading since its author, obviously well-informed, takes as much pain in hiding the sources of his learning as he must have taken in acquiring it); Darling, 1961 (deals primarily with conditions in England, but has a good bibliographical section); Macdonagh, 1964 (stresses the antibiotic effects of hops permitting preservation and transportation of beer); Birch 1965 (useless). In a more recent study, Arnald Steiger traced the origin of the custom even further eastward. The earliest word forms for hops (best reflected in Old Turkish qumlaq), Steiger contends are found in a variety of Ural-Altaic languages of great antiquity. From there the term migrated west into the orbit of the Slavic languages (Old Slavic ch?mel? and through the latter into the North Germanic language groups (Old West Nordic humili) which transmitted it to the Salian and Ripuarian Franks (Middle Latin humelo . . . leading to Modern French houblon). This evidence, Steiger argues, suggests that the practice of hopping beer originated in Central Asia and was transmitted from there to Northern and Western Europe by the Slavs along the linguistic channels indicated by the migration of the word for hops.40 40 Steiger, op. cit. The Greeks knew the plant only in its uncultivated state (and under a different name), but the Romans grew it in their vegetable gardens and used it as a flavoring agent for salads.41 41 Pliny, Hist. Nat., book XXI, chap. 50; ed. cit., VI, 1951, 222-23. Earliest medieval mention of hops Probably the earliest medieval mention of the plant is a charter of A.D. 768 in which King Pepin the Short deeded some hop gardens (homularia) to the monastery of St.Denis.42 42 Mon. Germ. Hist., Dipl. Karol., I, Hannover 1906, 38-40, No. 28. Donation, dated Sept. 768, of the forest of Iveline to the Abbey of St. Denis by Pepin: et in Ulfrisiagas mansos duos et Humlonarias cum integritate. Uisiniolo Similiter, Ursionevillare similiter. During the reign of Charlemagne and Louis the Pious the evidence multiplies. Abbot Ansegis (823-833) lists amongst the annual deliveries to be made to the Abbey of St.-Wandrille (Fontanella): "beer made from hops, as much as is needed" (sicera homulone quantum necessitas exposcit).43 43 Constitutio Ansigis Abbatis, in Gesta S.S. Patr. Font. Coen., ed. Lohier-Laporte, 1936, 121; and trans. by Charles W. Jones, III, 125-26. Hops were part of the revenues paid to the Abbey of St.-Germain-des-Prés from several outlying possessions (The fiscs of Combs-la-Ville, of Marenil and of Boissy),44 44 In the Polyptych of Abbot Irminon the plant is referred to as humulo, humelo, umlo, and fumlo. See paragraph HOUBLON by M. B. Guérard, in Polyptyque de L'Abbé Irminon, I, Paris 1844, 714 and the passages there referred to. and the plant is mentioned in various places in deeds of the abbey of Freisingen, dating from the reign of Louis and Pious as well as from later periods.45 45 For sources see Hehn, 1887, 387. All of these references to the plant, in conjunction with the detailed directives issued by Abbot Adalhard on the tithing and internal distribution of hops leave no doubt that, at the time of Louis the Pious, hops had become a customary ingredient of beer produced in the transalpine monasteries of the Empire.46 46 England resisted its use throughout most of the Middle Ages, retaining preference for the traditional ale, which was brewed without hops. Cf. Macdonagh, 1964, 531. One of the beneficial effects of its admixture, besides the distinctive flavor it imparted to the brew, was that owing to its antibiotic properties it prolonged the life of beer considerably over that of the older and more perishable ale.47 47 "Ale had to be drunk very soon after brewing; beer did not turn acid and sour for some while, the length of time depending mainly on the amount of hops used." Macdonagh, loc. cit. This was of great importance when storage in bulk was required and where transportation was involved—as they inevitably were in the beer economy of a monastic settlement. Contemporary sources make it quite clear that not all the beer consumed by the monks and their serfs was brewed inside the monastic enclosure. All the larger outlying agricultural holdings, and many of the smaller ones, had their own facilities for brewing. The delivery of a tenth of their home-brewed beer was a standard procedure in the tithing of tenants. Records of these tithes appear in the deeds of the monastery of St. Gall from as early as the middle of the eighth century. Some of the tenants had licenses to set up taverns, and many of these continued to pay for their tenancy through the delivery of beer even later, when all other forms of tithing in naturalia had been abolished.48 48 See Bikel, 1914, 119-20; with reference to original sources. Work in the bake and brew house: a privilege of the monks Working in the Bake and Brew House was one of the manual labors traditionally required of the brothers, and so specifically stipulated both in the preliminary and the final resolutions of the First Synod of Aachen (816).49 49 Statuta Murbacensia, chap. 4, ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 443: "Quinto, ut fratres in coquina, in pistrino et ceteris officiis artium propiis manibus laborent et uestimenta sua lauent." For the full text of chapter 4 of the Final Resolutions, see I, 23 n.31. The brothers apparently liked this work, since one of the protests lodged before the emperor in the same year by the monks of Fulda about the hardships brought upon them by Abbot Ratger's excessive building program included the complaint that it deprived them of their traditional right to work in the Bake and Brew House (pistrinum and brati- arium).50 50 See I, 187-90 and 189 n.7. It does not seem far-fetched to suppose that the constant warmth of the bakery attracted the brothers to the chore of breadmaking. During the long northern winters, when all warmth was leached from the cloister, the bakery was one of the few places in the community a monk could work in comfort of body as well as of soul, and surrounded by the incomparable fragrance of new bread. V. 17 FACILITIES FOR THE RAISING OF POULTRY AND LIVESTOCK V.17.1 ANIMAL HUSBANDRY: AN INTRINSIC PART OF THE MONASTIC ECONOMY The presence on the Plan of St. Gall of a vast array of houses for livestock and poultry and their keepers may at first seem puzzling in view of the monks' essentially vegetarian diet. It becomes a less surprising phenomenon, however, when one considers that, although meat was categorically interdicted to the monks themselves by a rule that left no margin for ambiguity, it was permitted to the serfs and workmen, who outnumbered the monks, and even to the monks themselves in times of sickness and during the period of bloodletting.1 1 On St. Benedict concerning the consumption of meat, see above, I, 277ff. This may be unequivocally inferred from the Administrative Directives of Adalhard of Corbie, which regulate the distribution of meat both to the serfs and to the guests of the monastery. See I, 305-306. With regard to the relaxation of the general rules concerning meat consumption during sickness and the time of bloodletting, see I, 275; and above, p. 188. But there are other reasons, and probably more important ones, why the raising of livestock was a necessary part of the monastic economy. Animals were needed for hauling and riding. Without horses and oxen harnessed to plows and carts, the serfs could neither have tilled the soil nor brought in the harvest. Saddle horses were an indispensable means of transportation for the abbot or any other monastic official whose business took him onto the monastery's outlying estates. Horses had to be raised for the king as an annual contribution to the common defense, and horses had to be kept in readiness for the armed men whom the monastery was required to dispatch to the king's army in times of war.2 2 On the monastery's share in the defense of the country, see I, 347ff. Cows, sheep, goats, and pigs were slaughtered for their meat, and from the Liber benedictionum of Ekkehart we learn that the cuts of meat from these animals were as cherished in his day on the tables of those who could afford them as they are today.3 3 Liber benedictionum Ekkehart's IV, verse 95-115, ed. Egli, 1909, 292-93; Schulz, 1941. But cows, goats, and sheep also produced milk, a more important product, because it was used to make cheese—a staple in everyone's diet. Sheep's wool was indispensable for making coats and blankets. Leather was made from the hides of oxen. The skin of the calf and the lamb yielded a commodity that was of prime importance for the monastery's religious and educational mission: parchment. The quill used in writing the sacred texts came from the wings of geese. The meat of poultry, as has already been pointed out, was not subject to the same restrictions as the meat of quadrupeds. The second synod of Aachen (817) granted it to the monks for a period of eight days on each of the great religious feasts of Christmas and Easter. Later the number of days was reduced to four on each of these PLAN OF ST. GALL, HENHOUSE, HOUSE FOR FOWLKEEPERS, GOOSEHOUSE 466. 466.X SITE PLAN The proximity of the fowl runs to the Granary, Vegetable Garden, and Orchard shows with what degree of skill convenience and necessity were planned for by the makers of the Plan. Grain for feed could be gleaned or threshed at need in the Granary and carried to the fowl runs. Proximity to the gardens was a boon for both birds and their keepers—garden clippings might provide the chickens and geese with additional food, while in the beds and orchard manure from the pens could quickly be distributed, enhancing sanitation. In all facilities housing animals on the Plan of St. Gall, the herdsmen and keepers lived in close contact with beasts; while the fowlkeepers were spared the literal necessity of "going to bed with the chickens," their house is separated by only ten feet from the two poultry enclosures. The house for fowlkeepers is 35 feet in length (ridge axis E to W) and 42½ feet wide. Its communal hall with fireplace measures 22½ × 35 feet, allowing two 10-foot aisles at either side for sleeping accommodation. The form that the pair of circular pens may have taken is discussed extensively on the following pages. Their sheer size, at a diameter of 42½ feet (across the outermost circle) is impressive evidence of the importance that poultry (perhaps including ducks) had in the monastic economy. A monastery population of the size postulated on the Plan of St. Gall would in itself have required many birds to augment diet; the guest facilities and lay dependents proposed for St. Gall made planning for fowl pens of this size a necessity. The poultry houses and that for their keepers are masterpieces of functional planning; they exhibit great charm in the symmetrical composition of circular with rectangular structures. 467. LUTTRELL PSALTER (1340). GOOSEHERD LONDON, BRITISH MUSEUM, ADD. MS. 42130, fol. 169v (detail) [By courtesy of the Trustees of the British Museum] A goose and five goslings are threatened by a hawk; the gooseherd waves his hood and staff at it to drive it off. Geese were not only useful as food, but kept vermin and garden pest populations down; their raucous and hostile response to strangers, well known since the early days of Rome, may have added to their utility in the life of a large monastic complex. occasions.4 4 For details, see I, 277. For the rest of the year, when consumption was prohibited, hens were of vital importance for their capacity to produce eggs—a year round staple in the monastic diet and one of its most important sources of protein. For egg production alone, the raising of poultry was bound to be one of the most important aspects of monastic animal husbandry, and the polyptichs and household accounts from medieval abbeys abound with records of supplementary deliveries of eggs, chickens, and hens (ova, pulli et gallinae) from the abbey's outlying farms.5 5 Wartmann, III, 1875, Appendix, Nr. 59.2, 757-58. Lastly we must not overlook the fact that these animals provided the only good fertilizer that was known to the medieval agriculturalist and one that made a vital contribution to the enrichment of the community's crop and harvest. It becomes quite clear then, that despite the monks' essentially vegetarian diet, the monastery as a self-sustaining economic and agricultural entity could not forego the need to raise livestock and poultry in quantities commensurate with the number of men whom it had to clothe and feed. In the spring, summer, and autumn the majority of monastic animals were unquestionably put out to pasture. For that reason, the houses for livestock and their keepers shown on the Plan of St. Gall are likely to define only that space which was needed to stable the animals kept under roof and shelter during the harsh winter months in order to insure the propagation of the species. The costliness of stall feeding demanded that this be done with discretion. A thirteenth-century directive recorded in the cartulary of Gloucester Abbey rules that "no useless and unfertile animals are to be wintered on hay and forage" (quod nulla animalia inutilia et infructuosa hyementur ad consumptionem foeni vel foragii) and the text makes it clear that exceptions to this ruling should be made only with regard to such useful and deserving animals as the plow oxen and breeding cows (talia scilicet de quibus non credatur posse nutriri aliquis bos utilis ad carucas vel vacca competens ad armentum).6 6 Historia et Cartularium Monasterii S. Petri Gloucestriae, in Rerum Britannicarum Medii Aevi Scriptores, XXX:3, London, 1867, 215. Cf. Hilton, 1966, 120-21. The directive reflects a general condition of medieval animal husbandry that pervaded all social strata and the whole of medieval life, with only minor variations on the highest levels. The importance of animal husbandry is eloquently attested by St. Fructuosus in the ninth chapter of his Galician Rule. As noted in the translation by Barlow, this chapter does not appear in the Fructuosan Rule for other areas, presumably because (as Fructuosus acknowledges) 468. MEINDERT HOBBEMA A FARM IN THE SUNLIGHT (1660-1670) NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART, WASHINGTON D.C. [By courtesy of the Trustees of the National Gallery of Art] then, as now, Galicia required "more work on the soil than any other land" and the monk in whose charge lay the pasturing of livestock needed not only firm direction but also moral support: "Those who accept the charge of attending the livestock of the monastery should show such concern for them that they will not cause any harm to the crops, and they should be watched so carefully and so astutely that they will not be devoured by wild beasts, and they should be kept away from steep and rocky mountains and inaccessible valleys, so that they will not slip over a precipice. But, if any of the above-mentioned negligent deeds happens because of inattention or lack of care on the part of the shepherds, they shall straightway throw themselves at the feet of their elders and, as though deploring great sins, shall for a considerable time suffer penance worthy of such a fault. . . . The flocks are to be placed in the charge of a monk who is well-proved, who was trained to this sort of work while in the world, and who desires to guard the flocks with such good intention that never the slightest complaint comes from his lips. They may have younger ones assigned them by turns to share their labor. They may have sufficient clothing and covering for the feet. One monk, such as we have mentioned, shall be responsible for this service, so as not to inconvenience all the monks in the monastery. But since some who guard the flocks are accustomed to complain and think they have no reward for such service when they cannot be seen praying and working in the congregation, let them harken to the words of the Rules of the Fathers . . . recognizing the examples of the Fathers of old, for the patriarchs tended flocks, and Peter performed the duties of a fisherman, and Joseph the Just, to whom the Virgin Mary was espoused, was a carpenter. Accordingly, they have no reason to dislike the sheep which have been assigned to them, for they shall reap not one but many rewards. Their young shall be refreshed, their old shall be warmed, their captives redeemed, their guests and strangers entertained. Besides, most monasteries would scarcely have enough food for three months, if there existed only the daily bread in this province, which requires more work on the soil than any other land. Therefore, one who is assigned this task should happily obey and should most firmly believe that his obedience frees him from all danger and prepares him for a great reward before God, just as the disobedient one suffers the loss of his soul."7 7 St. Fructuosus, General Rule for Monasteries, Chapter 9, translated by Claude W. Barlow in Iberian Fathers, vol. 2, 189-90, Washington, D.C., 1969 (The Fathers of the Church, vol. 63). For the Latin text see Sancti Fructuosi Bracarensis episcopi regula monastica communis, cap. IX, in J. P. Migne, Patr. Lat. LXXXVII, Paris, 1863, cols. 1117-18. The Common Rule of St. Fructuosus was written about A.D. 660 after he had founded numerous monasteries in western Spain. The total area set aside for animal husbandry on the Plan of St. Gall takes up more than one-fourth of the monastery site. It accommodates six houses for the larger breeds and two enclosures for poultry, as well as the living rooms and bedrooms needed for their keepers. The stables for the larger animals are concentrated in a large service yard lying to the south and west of the claustrum; the houses for the poultry are in the southeast corner of the monastery site, between the vegetable garden and the granary. V.17.2 HOUSES FOR POULTRY &amp; THEIR KEEPERS The monastery's facilities for the raising of poultry consist of a dwelling for the fowlkeepers and two circular enclosures—one for hens, the other for geese. They lie in a plot of land about 60 feet wide and 145 feet long. HOUSE OF THE FOWLKEEPERS The House of the Fowlkeepers (fig. 466) lies midway between the Hen House and the Goose House. It is a relatively small and simple house, 42½ feet wide and 35 feet long, consisting of a "common hall" (domus communis) with a fireplace, and two aisles, one serving as "dwelling for the keeper of the hen house" (mansio pullorum custodis), the other as "dwelling for the keeper of the goose house" (item custodis aucaru). The house is entered axially through doors in its eastern and western gable walls, which assure the shortest and most direct communication with the Hen House and Goose House. The House of the Fowlkeepers is the only example among the Plan's guest and service buildings in which the principal room of the house has aisles on only two sides and is connected directly with the exterior by doors located in the two gable walls. A fine pictorial record of this type of house may be found in a painting by Meindert Hobbema (fig. 468) entitled A Farm in the Sunlight. This small, relatively modest farmhouse is aisled but has no lean-to's on the gable side. A chimney in the ridge of the roof suggests that it has a central fireplace. The entrances, as in the House of the Fowlkeepers, are obviously in the longitudinal axis of the building. The frame of timber supporting this roof may have corresponded, beam by beam, to that of the House of the Fowlkeepers. Our reconstructions (fig. 469) are an attempt to interpret this system. HENHOUSE AND GOOSE HOUSE Layout and design The Hen House and the Goose House lie on either side of the House of the Fowlkeepers, one to the west, one to the east (fig. 466). They are the same size and identical in design. Each consists of three concentric circles, drawn at diameters of 12½, 27½, and 42½ feet. The only entrance to each is on the side facing the House of the Fowlkeepers. The enclosures are identified by metric titles written in capitalis rustica (a distinction not accorded to any other building housing animals): PULLORUM HIC CURA ET PERPES NUTRITIO CONSTAT HERE IS ESTABLISHED THE CARE OF THE CHICKENS AND THEIR CONTINUOUS NOURISHMENT and: ANSERIBUS LOCUS HIC PARITER MANET APTUS ALENDIS THIS PLACE IS WELL FIT FOR THE SUSTENANCE OF GEESE The intermediate bands are not provided with titles, and the inner circle is decorated with an eight-lobed rosette—of the same design and probably the same apotropaic purpose as the corresponding symbol in the two church towers. The interpretation of these two circular poultry houses poses problems. Classical, medieval, and modern parallels I do not know of any classical prototypes. The Roman hen and goose houses described by Columella and Varro were buildings of rectangular shape.8 8 Columella, On Agriculture, Book VIII, chap. 3, ed. Ash-Forster-Heffner, II, 1954, 331-37. Varro, On Agriculture, Book III, chap. 9, ed. Hooper-Ash, I, 1936, 473-75. Cf. also Ghigi, 1939, 59ff, and 89ff. But the question arises whether there may be some typological connection between the hen and goose houses of the Plan of St. Gall and the circular bird house which Varro built in his villa at Casinum.9 9 On Varro's aviary at Casinum, see Buren and Kennedy, 1919. There appear to be no medieval parallels, unless a circular enclosure with two rectangular attachments on the grounds of the tenth-century royal palace at Cheddar, in Somerset, England (fig. 470)—which its excavator, Philip Rahtz, interpreted as a mill with grain bin and bakery—was in reality a chicken house. The light construction of its walls, all braided in wattlework, may speak in favor of such an assumption.10 10 Rahtz himself is reconsidering his original interpretation of this installation (personal communication); see Rahtz, 1962-1963, 62. In his model of 1877 Julius Lehmann reconstructed the poultry houses of St. Gall in the image of a medieval dovecot (fig. 267). He interpreted the outer circle as a wall, and the area between this circle and the inner circle as an open poultry run. Besides the fact that this interpretation completely disregards the existence of an intermediate circle, Lehmann's solution involves a conspicuous imbalance between running and roosting space and would appear to be incompatible with the functional perspicacity that the author of the Plan exhibits in the handling of all other details of this nature. The clue to the riddle may be found in an octagonal chicken house built in the nineteenth century by Freiherr von Ulm-Erbach, and described in 1886 in Bruno Dürigen's monumental work on poultry breeding (fig. 472).11 11 Dürigen, 1886, 655-57, from which the plan and elevation shown in fig. 472A-B are taken. Dürigen referred to the design of this house as "a formerly favored" but "now superannuated" form that had a long tradition and was used in many zoological gardens because of its specific suitability for exhibition purposes.12 12 Dürigen, II, 1927, 213. The house is 26 feet (8 meters) in diameter and 23 feet (7 meters) high. Like the poultry houses of the Plan, it has three concentric strips of space and only one entrance. The HOUSE OF THE FOWLKEEPERS 469.B TRANSVERSE SECTION 469.A GROUND PLAN 469.D LONGITUDINAL SECTION 469.C WEST ELEVATION AUTHORS' RECONSTRUCTION Among the guest and service buildings of the Plan, this house is the sole example in which the communal inner hall is flanked by aisles only on its two long sides. The hall is divided into three bays—a center bay 15 feet deep and two gable bays 10 feet deep. A division into four bays of equal width would have brought the center truss into conflict with the fireplace and doors leading from hall into aisles. In all other respects our reconstruction is modeled after the farmhouse in the Hobbema painting of fig. 468. 470. CHEDDAR, SOMERSET, ENGLAND SAXON PALACE SITE, 10th CENTURY [Redrawn from Rahtz, 1962/3, 62, fig. 24] Of the two alternatives considered by Rahtz, the identification of this site as a poultry house (rather than a corn mill) appears to be the more plausible, unless it could be demonstrated that an animal-driven mill, common among the Romans (cf. figs. 441-442), but subsquently used only when water power was lacking (as during drought), would still have been operating in the 10th century in an Anglo-Saxon palace. All available literary sources seem to offer evidence to the contrary. Had the circular component of this structure housed a mill, it seems likely that the supports of so heavy a mechanism would have left evidence more tangible than that found on the site. outermost strip is open to the sky and serves as a daytime run for the chickens. The intermediate strip is roofed over and serves as coop, leaving in the center a tower-like projection, the raised roof of which admits air and light through clerestory windows. The chickens are fed and watered from this center space, and the house can be heated by a stove set up in this area. The portion serving as coop consists of a lower and an upper tier, the lower being used for laying and brooding, and the upper, for fattening.13 13 This, at least, is the way the building was planned. In actuality, the upper tier was modified, to the detriment of its function, because the building site did not permit a structure of the height required by two full stories. Both tiers have trap doors toward the chicken run which can be closed at night, with ladders enabling the birds to descend to the ground from their roosting pens and to ascend again in the evening. Freiherr Ulm-Erbach's chicken coop had a housing capacity, on the lower tier alone, of 192 birds. The Hen House of the Plan, which is practically identical in dimensions, could have accommodated the same number—and if it were meant to be a double-tier arrangement, twice that number. For the geese and ducks (should anseres be a generic term for both of these breeds) this figure would have to be reduced by a ratio commensurate with their larger size. In Roman times, according to Columella,14 14 Columella, On Agriculture, Book VIII, chap. 2, ed. cit., II, 1954, 327. one laborer was considered sufficient to care for 200 chickens. On the Plan of St. Gall the keepers of the hen and goose houses are referred to in the singular, but the rooms in which they sleep are large enough to accommodate beds for three or four additional hands. The raising of chickens is a year-round operation; but geese generally mate in December, so that goslings can be grazed in the open fields in the spring, without supplementary feed and extra housing (fig. 467). The guarding of these flocks would require additional hands. Materials and location I am inclined to believe that the poultry houses on the Plan were meant to be masonry structures (fig. 473), not only because circular walls are more readily built in stone than in wood, but also because masonry makes more feasible the construction of holes into which the birds may retreat for laying and hatching. Columella rated laying-nests holed into masonry superior to wicker baskets suspended in front of the walls.15 15 Ibid. chap. 3, ed. cit., 333-34. It is likely that a wattlework fence was intended for the outer fence that enclosed the poultry runs. The siting of these houses is ideal, as the chickens and geese are located near their two basic foods. The granary lies on one side of the poultry enclosure, and the Monks' Vegetable Garden on the other. The chickens would doubtless have been eager to eat the weeds and scraps of vegetables, after these had been cleaned and cropped for the monks' table, as the gardeners were anxious to part with them. And the Monks' Vegetable Garden provided a suitable place to dispose of the birds' droppings when the poultry houses were cleaned out. GOSPELS OF ST. MEDARD OF SOISSONS (9TH CENT.)

Measuring 145 feet in length and 37½ feet in width, it is the largest of the buildings housing livestock. It contains in its center the "the hall for the oxherds and horse grooms" (domus bubulcorum &amp; equos seruantium). This is a large square room with an open fireplace in the center and benches all around its four walls, another unique and distinguishing feature among the buildings used for livestock and their attendants. The fireplace has unusually CHICKEN HOUSE 472.B ELEVATION 472.A PLAN BUILT BY FREIHERR VON ULM-EHRBACH The complexity of this poultry house may reflect centuries-long skills in efficient fowl husbandry; it could be a structure identical with that proposed for the Plan of St. Gall. (see p. 272). generous dimensions (12½ feet by 16 feet) and has inscribed into it a -shaped symbol which appears nowhere else on the Plan. The size of the fireplace and the seating capacity of the benches in this hall, both of which exceed by a considerable margin the needs of the occupants of this building, suggest that the hall of the oxherds and grooms might have served as kitchen and dining room for a larger segment of the monastery's serfs and laymen, perhaps for all those who were in charge of livestock. The -shaped symbol may have been the sign either for a hearth or for a wooden frame for the cranes from which caldrons were suspended on chains over the open fire.17 17 Cf. I, 73-75, and 281. One might also consider the possibility that it was a rig for making shoes for the draft animals, but there is no positive evidence that the hooves of horses and oxen were shod this early.18 18 The earliest written evidence for the use of horseshoes dates from the reign of the Byzantine Emperor Leo VI (886-911), and in the last decade of the ninth century "the sound of the shod hooves of horses" is mentioned in Ekkehart's Waltharius; cf. White, 1962, 57-59, where the whole question of the horseshoe is reviewed. The northern hall of the building serves as "stable for the mares" (stabulum equarum infra). It has overhead, a wooden ceiling (supra tabulatum), certainly a loft for the storage of hay.19 19 The words stabulum equarum are written by the main scribe. The word infra which completes this title and the line supra tabulatum which follows are annotations added in the pale ink used by the second scribe (cf. I, 13). By contrast, all of the titles inscribed into the southern wing of the building where the oxen and their attendants are housed are written with the ductus and dark brown ink of the main scribe. The "mangers" (praesepia) are carefully delineated on the Plan and seem to consist of a hayrack and a feeding trough. The grooms slept in an aisle running along the entire eastern side of the horses' stable (ad hoc seruiti? mansio). The southern half of the building contained the "stable for the oxen, below" (boum stabulum infra) and "overhead, a hayloft" (supra tabulat?). The "mangers for the oxen" (praesepia bo?), like those of the horses, ran along the western wall of the stable. The lean-to on the opposite side served as "quarters for the oxherds" (conclaue assecularum). The mangers of the oxen are separated by means of cross divisions into feeding areas 5 feet wide, doubtless to prevent the animals from striking each other with their horns. As there are eleven stalls, the stable for oxen was equipped to stall eleven head (five plowing teams and a spare). The same number of horses could have been accommodated in the stable for mares. Modern farming manuals recommend standing areas slightly larger (6½ feet), but the length of the stalls for horses and oxen on the Plan is not incompatible with the requirements of present-day stock management. There is ample space behind each animal to serve as a dung trench, and there is a generous margin of space on the other side of the stall for the storing of plows and yokes and other equipment needed for the operation of teams. Throughout the entire Middle Ages horses and oxen alike were used as draft animals. Numerous PLAN OF ST. GALL. HEN HOUSE. Authors' reconstruction 473.B SECTION 473.A PLAN 473.C ELEVATION For SITE PLAN showing relationship of the HENHOUSE to GOOSEHOUSE and to FOWLKEEPERS' HOUSE, see figure 466. X, page 265, and figure 466. The installation of the monastery's poultry in circular enclosures indicates that this kind of structure was not only in use at the time the Plan was made, but was sufficiently well known to be proposed as an exemplary solution for a monastic community of some 250-270 people. The enclosure provided for maximum flock size with greatest economy of space. With eggs a chief source of protein in the monks' diet, the more haphazard methods of raising poultry—i.e., letting birds run and nest at will all over the farmyard—were inappropriate; there was no time in so well-regulated a community to search each morning for the eggs of perhaps several hundreds of birds! Feeding, watering, sanitation, and doctoring were likewise attended to with ease through the architectural sophistication of circular fowl houses. A disadvantage of this type of enclosure is that it cannot readily be enlarged, and is thus most appropriate for a community of planned population. PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR HORSES AND OXEN AND THEIR KEEPERS 474. 474.X This house differs from the other guest and service buildings in that its center space with fireplace and benches (designated as the "living room of the oxherders and grooms") reaches across the entire width of the building. The stables for the horses and oxen do not surround, but extend laterally away from it. The early and high medieval buildings shown in figs. 477-481 demonstrate that tripartite long houses of this type were not uncommon in the Middle Ages. medieval illuminations could be adduced to attest to this fact; two of the finest examples of this type, from the margins of the Luttrell Psalter, are shown in figures 475 and 476.20 20 Luttrell Psalter, fols. 170, 171; see Millar, 1932, pls. 92 and 94. IMPORTANT ROLE OF THE MONASTERY'S HORSES AND OXEN The generous dimensions assigned to the House for Horses and Oxen testifies, not only to the important role these beasts of burden played in the monastic economy, but also to the high social standing their caretakers held amongst the monastery's permanent body of servants.21 21 The high social status of the caretakers of the plow and cart pulling oxen among the permanent servants of a medieval estate is reflected in the payments for their services recorded in manorial accounts. I am quoting from R. H. Hilton's summary of these conditions in the West Midlands of thirteenth-century England: "The most important of the full-time servants were those ploughmen (tenatores) who actually guided the plough, better paid than the fugatores who drove the plough animals. Carters were normally equivalent in status to the chief ploughman, then came the cowman, swineherd and dairymaid. Full-time shepherds were of high status, but quite often shepherds would only be taken for periods of less than a year, such as for the winter or summer visit of the flock to a manor." (Hilton, 1966, 137). Columella writes that in his day one farm laborer was considered enough to look after two yokes of oxen.22 22 Columella, On Agriculture, Book VI, chap. 2, ed. Forster-Heffner, II, 1954, 137. The bedrooms of the oxherds on the Plan are large enough to provide bed space for seven hands; and the same number of men could be accommodated in the quarters of the horse grooms. MEDIEVAL &amp; PROTOHISTORIC PARALLELS OF THE HOUSE FOR HORSES AND OXEN The House for Horses and Oxen and their Keepers differs from all the other livestock buildings shown on the Plan in that the stabling areas for the animals and the bedrooms of the herdsmen are not arranged peripherally around a central living room with a fireplace, but rather, extend outward on the two opposite sides of that room so as to form a longhouse. This particular layout is a very ancient one and was used in the Middle Ages for other purposes as well. 475. LUTTRELL PSALTER (1340). HARROWING LONDON, BRITISH MUSEUM, ADD.

A slinger following the harrow tries to drive off two crows flying overhead. Harrows with iron teeth or tines pegged through a wooden frame (and perhaps originally operated with wooden pegs) are among the oldest animal-powered agricultural tools. They were used to break up clods after the soil was plowed, to level the earth for seeding, and to cover the seed after it was broadcast. One horse, properly harnessed, as this drawing shows, was able to draw the harrow. Royal guesthouses of the Consuetudines Farfenses An interesting guesthouse for royal travelers, bearing striking resemblance to the House for Horses and Oxen, is described in the Consuetudines Farfenses23 23 Consuetudines Farfenses, fol. 79r-80r, ed.

Next to the narthex must be built a lodging 135 feet long, 30 feet wide, for receiving all visiting men who arrive at the monastery with horsemen.

The plow itself, with heavy blade cutting vertically, plowshare at right angles cutting horizontally, and mould board turning the cut slice over to the side, is one of those great innovations made by the barbarians of the North in the early Middle Ages, and one that changed the course of history. For its primitive Roman prototype incapable of coping with the heavy alluvial soil of the North, see fig. 262, I, 348. For a superb review of the full economic and cultural impact of this piece of equipment, see Lynn White, 1963, 44ff. where they alone may attend to their natural necessities. In the middle of this lodging should be placed tables like the refectory tables where both men and women may eat.25 25 "Juxta galileam constructum debet esse palatium longitudinis Cta XXXta et Ve pedes, latitudinis XXXta, ad recipiendum omnes supervenientes homines, qui cum equitibus adventaverint monasterio. Ex una parte ipsius domus sunt preparata XLta lecta et totidem pulvilli ex pallio, ubi requiescant viri, tantum, cum latrinis XLta. Ex alia namque parte ordinati sunt lectuli XXXta ubi comitisse vel aliae honestae mulieres pausent cum latrinis XXXta ubi solae ipsae suas indigerias procurent. In medio autem ipsius palatiis affixae sint mense sicuti refectorii tabulae, ubi aedant tam viri quam mulieres." Consuetudines Farfenses, ed. cit., 138. The Farfa Consuetudinary describes a guesthouse that is to be an integral part of the architectural layout of an eleventh-century monastery. (The mounts and grooms of the traveling party were to be housed in a separate building.) The measurements of this building, as listed in this account, are wholly compatible with the function it was to perform, as is demonstrated in the reconstruction of its layout shown in fig. 477, where it is assumed that the mattresses were ranged side by side at right angles to the long walls. Laid out in this manner, the two wings of the building could indeed yield sleeping space for forty men and thirty ladies, leaving in the center a dining hall 30 feet square. The privies, as the text implies, were separate. They could not have been arranged in a single line, as that would have required an outhouse 175 feet long (40 feet more than the house itself). The proportions are more reasonable, if we assume that they were arranged in a double row.26 26 Schlosser's reconstruction of this building (Schlosser, 1889, fig. 2) lacks accuracy of detail. The reconstruction shown in fig. 477 is basically identical with that which Kenneth John Conant suggested in 1965, 180, fig. 1, except that instead of attaching the two privies to the end of the building, I have placed them parallel to its northern long side, as in the House for Distinguished Guests on the Plan of St. Gall. I am offering this as an alternative to, not as a substitute for, Prof. Conant's suggestion. Monks' dormitory in the monastery of St. Wandrille There is other, and even earlier, evidence for the use of a longhouse of this description as sleeping quarters. The Gesta abbatum Fontanellensium describes a building of this type erected by Abbot Ansegis (823-833) as a dormitory for the monks of the monastery of St.-Wandrille (Fontanella): Moreover these are the buildings, public and private, begun and completed by him. First of all, he had built the most noble dormitory for the brothers, 208 feet long and 27 feet wide, the entire work rising to a height of 64 feet. The walls were built in well-dressed stone with joints of mortar made of lime and sand; and it had in its center a solarium, embellished by the very best pavement and a ceiling overhead that was decorated with the most noble 477. GUEST HOUSE OF CLUNY II (BUILT BY ABBOT ODILO, 994-1048). DIAGRAMMATIC PLAN The similarity in layout of this house and that for the horses and oxen and their keepers on the Plan of St. Gall (fig. 474) is perplexing. Both must derive from the same genus of buildings the protohistoric origins of which are attested by the long house of Westlick and the Carolingian or pre-Carolingian longhouses of Warendorf (fig. 325.B). As on the Plan of St. Gall, the guest house at Cluny was located at the north-west corner of the monastery church; also see K. J. Conant's plan of Cluny II, fig. 515, p. 335 below. paintings. On the higher levels of this building, there were windows of glass. Apart from the walls, the entire structure was built with wood from the heart of oak, and roofed over by tiles held in place by iron nails. Above, it has tie beams and a ridge.27 27 AEDIFICIA autem publîca ac priuata ab ipso coepta et consummata haec sunt: Inprimis dormîtorium fratrum nobilissimum construî fecit, habentem longitudinis pedum CC VIII, latitudinis uero XXVII; porro omnis eius fabrica porrigitur in altîtudine pedum LXIIII; cuîus muri de calce fortissimo ac uiscoso arenaque rufa et fossili lapideque tofoso ac probato constructi sunt.

For an earlier visual reconstruction of Ansegis's cloister see Horn 1973, 46, fig. 47. Again, we are dealing with a building of extremely elongated shape, with arms reaching out in opposite directions from a central space whose function differs distinctly from that of the extended parts. In St.-Wandrille this central portion served as sunroom (solarium) and therefore must have been more open than the wings in which the 478.A FONTANELLA (ST.-WANDRILLE) SEINE-MARITIME FRANCE, FOUNDED BY ST. WANDRILLE, 645 SCHEME OF CRITERIA FOR AN INTERPRETIVE STUDY FONTANELLA (ST.-WANDRILLE) These studies show in the Carolingian monastery of Fontanella a dormitory that is a monastic variant of a Germanic long house of very ancient vintage, examples of which are discussed in this chapter. Our present interpretation, differing from those proposed by von Schlosser, 1889, Hager, 1901, and in minutiae even from one proposed by Horn (1973, 46, fig. 47), makes no claim for authenticity in particulars. The design of the architectural envelope, its fenestration, and its "graceful cloister walks" is an exercise of imagination. But we feel confident of the interpretation of the disposition of primary building masses. The Gesta Abbatum Fontanellensium, written around A.D. 830 and 845, describes the church of Abbot St. Wandrille, begun in 649 (here translated pending fuller treatment in a subsequent study): "The above-said admirable father built in this place a basilica in the name of the most blessed prince of the Apostles, Peter, in squared stones and having 290 feet in length and 37 feet in width." Almost 200 years later Ansegis began construction of the cloister. First to be built was a new dormitory (see Latin and English text, p. 277). The Gesta describes the erection of a new refectory and a third structure, the MAIOR DOMUS: "Thereafter he built another house called the refectory, through the middle of which he had constructed a masonry wall to divide it so that one part would serve as refectory, the other as cellar. This building was of precisely the same material and the same dimensions as the dormitory . . . then he caused to be erected a third exceptional structure which they called `the larger building'. It turned toward the east, with one end touching the dormitory, the other adjoining the refectory. He ordered a supply room to be installed in it, and a warming room, as well as several other rooms. But because of his premature death this work remained in part unfinished. "These three most beautiful buildings are laid out in this manner: the dormitory is situated with one end turned toward the north, the other toward the south, with its south end attached to the basilica of St. Peter. The refectory likewise is aligned in these two directions, and on the south side it almost touches the apse of the basilica of St. Peter. Then that larger building is placed just as we have said above . . . . The church of St. Peter lies to the south and faces east . . . ." The chronicler finished his account by telling us that Ansegis "ordered graceful porches to be built in front of the dormitory, refectory, and larger house," and that he added midway along the cloister walk "in front of the dormitory a house for charters" and "in front of the refectory a building in which to preserve a quantity of books." On the use of the cloister wing that runs along the flank of the church as a place for daily chapter meetings, see I, 249ff. Ansegis's construction of the claustral range of Fontanella, begun in 823, precedes Gozbert's reconstruction of the monastery of St. Gall by only a few years. Like St. Gall, Fontanella conforms with the claustral scheme emerging from Aachen in 816-817: its ranges enclose an open court adjacent to one flank of the church. The topography of Fontanella did not allow Ansegis to place the new cloister on the south side of the church (as did Gozbert at St. Gall, in conformity with the Aachen scheme; cf. below, 327ff) because the old church of St. Wandrille already stood against the southern slope of a valley too steep to permit further construction. But there was ample space for building on the flat valley floor north of the church. In Ansegis's time the Roman supply road from Rouen ran east of the abbey, and the unchanneled Seine often flooded the low valley meadows. These limitations of topography caused Ansegis to adopt a most unorthodox order for his claustral buildings— cellar and refectory to the east; close to supply routes; dormitory to the west. A further difference is that in the Aachen scheme all claustral structures were double-storied whereas at Fontanella they were not; hence their inordinate length. Ansegis's cloister strikingly illustrates the Carolingian search for a new order in which a Roman passion for symmetry and monumentality prevails over loose, casual assembly of parts. It is furthermore a testimony to the triumph of Benedictine monachism over other less ordered forms of monastic observance, and the role the Benedictine ideals played in lending new eminence and vigor to the quest for cultural unity that pervaded the whole of Carolingian life. monks were bedded. Perhaps this solarium had the form of a large transeptal porch with heavily fenestrated gables. Protohistoric houses of similar design I mentioned before that this particular layout was a very ancient one. Longhouses of comparable design were excavated by Doppelfeld in a Migration Period settlement on the Bärhorst, near Nauen, Germany;28 28 Doppelfeld, 1937/38, 284ff. by Bänfer, Stieren, and Klein in a Migration Period settlement at Westick, near Kamen, Westphalia;29 29 Bänfer, Stieren, and Klein, 1936, 410ff. and by Winkelmann, at Warendorf, near Münster,30 30 Winkelmann, 1954, 189ff; 1958, 492ff. in a settlement datable by its pottery to A.D. 650-800 (fig. 478) This building type spread from the Continent to England, where it is attested by a Saxon longhall of the ninth century, excavated in 1960-62 by Philip Rahtz in Cheddar, Somerset (fig. 479)31 31 For Cheddar, see Rahtz, 1962-63. and numerous buildings of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries when it became a favorite layout for monastic barns in the counties of Wiltshire, Gloucester, and Somerset. Figures 480 and 481 are typical examples. The first is a broadside view of the fourteenth-century barn at Pilton, Somerset, a dependency of the abbey of Glastonbury; and, the second, a plan of the fifteenth-century barn of Tisbury, Wiltshire, one of the outlying granges of the abbesses of Shaftsbury.32 32 For Pilton, see Andrews, 1901, 30; Cook-Smith, 1960, 30-31, and figs. 207-210; and Crossley, 1951, fig. 130. For Tisbury, see Andrews loc. cit.; Dufty, 1947. The roof of the barn of Pilton was destroyed by fire in 1963 (cf. Horn &amp; Born, 1969, 162). Reconstruction In our reconstruction of the House for Horses and Oxen and Their Keepers (fig. 482A-G), we have emphasized the function of the domus bubulcorum &amp; equas seruantium as the living, dining, and cooking area of the herdsmen (and perhaps an even larger segment of the monastery's serfs and laymen) by giving to this portion of the building the form of a large transeptal hall, whose ridge intersects the ridge of the stables. We have interpreted the bedrooms of the oxherds and grooms as aisles, attached to the flank of the stables; the stables themselves, as internally undivided spaces whose roofs are carried by a continuous set of coupled rafters of uniform scantling. There are other 478.B AN INTERPRETATION BASED ON THE GESTA ABBATUM FONTANELLENSIUM et alii BY THE AUTHORS possibilities, equally acceptable. In the large transeptal hall we have introduced four posts, which are not shown on the Plan; we have assumed them because it appeared unlikely to us that in a service building of this type the roof would have rested on beams spanning nearly 40 feet. V.17.4 HOUSE FOR COWS AND COWHERDS LAYOUT AND DESIGN Hic arm[enta] tibi la? fa &amp; us lac atq· ministrant33 33 The inscription is damaged. Hic armenta tibi [lac] faetus lac atque ministrant is the traditional reading. After the title was written, lac was shifted forward from its position between faetus and atque to a place between tibi and faetus; but the scribe failed to erase or strike out the superfluous lac. Here the cows furnish you with milk and offspring Directly west of the House for Horses and Oxen, within the fences of a large rectangular yard containing four other livestock buildings, is the House for the Cows and Cowherds (fig. 483). Its title makes it irrevocably clear that the animals that find shelter in this structure perform the dual role of serving as dairy and breeding stock. The house is entered broadside by a door leading directly into the "hall of the herdsmen" (domus armentariorum), which is provided with the customary central fireplace. Ranged on three sides around this space, in the shape of the letter U, are the stables for the dairy cows (stabula); the extremities of this stable 479. CHEDDAR, SOMERSET, ENGLAND. LONG HALL OF THE SAXON PALACE. 9TH CENTURY [after Rahtz, 1962-63, 58, fig. 20] The house, slightly boat-shaped (most markedly so on the west side) was 78 feet long externally, and 20 feet wide across the middle. Its walls consisted of closely spaced posts, 9 inches square, set against the outer edge of a continuous trench, and in certain places doubled by a row of inner posts of lighter scantling sloping inward. The entrances were in the middle of the long walls, with a minor one toward the north end of the east side. A spread of burnt clay in the southern half of the house close to the center may indicate the location of the hearth. arrangement are boarded off to form two small cubicles or "bedrooms for the servants" (cubilia seruanti?). Both Keller and Willis34 34 Keller, 1844, 33; Willis, 1848, 114. interpreted the area designated as domus armentariorum as an "open court" and the square in its center as "a small house perhaps inhabited by the overseer." There would be no need to refer to this superannuated interpretation had it not been rescuscitated lately in Alan Sorrell's recently published reconstruction of the II.22 houses of the Plan of St. Gall (fig. 283). Domus, as has been sufficiently stressed in earlier parts of this study, can only have referred to a covered portion of ground. It is the author's favorite term for "hall" or "living room" and cannot under any circumstances be interpreted as "courtyard." The square in the center, which is common to all the guest and service buildings on the Plan, is clearly identified in some of them as "fireplace" and in others as "louver."35 35 Cf. above, pp. 77-78. The House for the Cows and Cowherds is 87½ feet long and 50 feet wide, but whether this is the length of the original scheme is somewhat doubtful, since in this corner of the Plan the parchment contracts, and it is possible that the copyist found himself compelled to reduce the length of the building in order to adjust to this condition. The central hall of the cowherds measures 22½ feet by 52½ feet; its aisle and lean-to's have a width of 17½ feet. The traditional way of housing a dairy herd was to tie the cows in pairs in stalls 5 feet long and 7 feet wide.36 36 See Fream, 1962, 63-64. The aisle and lean-to's of the House for the Cows and Cowherds are wide enough for the animals to be tied up in two rows, one facing the outer walls (their customary protohistoric position) and another one facing the inner wall partitions. If stalled in this manner, the House for the Cows could have accommodated a total of seventy cows. If they were tied in a single row against the outer walls only, this figure would have to be reduced to forty. 480. PILTON, SOMERSET, ENGLAND. BARN OF GLASTONBURY GRANGE. 15TH CENTURY [Photo: Quentin Lloyd] Long barns with one or several transeptal porches are very common in the Midlands and southwest of England. They are rarely less than 100 feet long, often come close to 200 feet; and one example, the barn of the Benedictine abbey grange of Abbotsbury, Dorset, attained the astonishing length of 267 feet. The building type has never been systematically studied. For individual examples see Andrews, 1900, passim; Horn and Charles, 1966, Horn and Born, 1969, and Charles and Horn, 1973. F. W. B. Charles and Jane Charles recently measured this barn for us. It is 108 feet 6 inches long, 44 feet wide, and 17 feet high from floor to wall head. MILK AND CHEESE: PRIMARY ITEMS IN THE MONKS' DIET The primary purpose of this herd of dairy cows was to provide milk and cheese for the table of the monks. Butter does not seem to have been an important item in the monastic diet. The records of the monastery of St. Gall list altogether not more than one pint of butter.37 37 See Bikel, 1914, 110ff. From the same records we learn that in the territory of St. Gall cheese came in two sizes: a large round cheese (caseus alpinus) of the same diameter, more or less, as a Swiss cheese of today, usually cut into four parts (qui secantur in IV partes), occasionally into six or eight; and a "hand cheese," which was cut into two parts only (qui secantur in duas partes). Cheese was one of the most common articles of tithing contributed by the outlying farms, especially those in the mountains which specialized in cattle raising; and the annual revenue at St. Gall from its possessions in the territory of Appenzell alone was over 2,000 cheeses.38 38 Ibid. MEDIEVAL PARALLELS The external appearance of the House for the Cows and Cowherds must have been very similar to that of the Gardener's House (figs. 426-427), except that it was considerably larger, as one would expect it to be in view of its different function. It is the standard house of the Plan, minus one aisle on one of its long sides, which makes the main room of the house directly accessible from the exterior, a distinct advantage in buildings where great numbers of the larger breeds of animals, and especially horned cattle, are sheltered, because this arrangement reduces the number of doors through which the cattle must be taken as they enter and leave their stalls (figs. 483, 486). This house type must have been very common in the Middle Ages. The earliest literary evidence for its existence, so far as I can judge, occurs in a dossier of twelfth-century lease agreements that record the manorial holdings of the Dean and Chapter of St. Paul's in London.39 39 Hale, 1858, 122-39; cf. above, pp. 203ff. On a manor located in 481. TISBURY, WILTSHIRE, ENGLAND. PLAN, GRANGE BARN. 15TH CENTURY [Redrawn after Dufty, 1947, 168, fig. 2] The barn at Place Farm was part of a grange once owned by the abbesses of Shaftsbury. Its external dimensions are 196 feet long by 38 feet wide. It is lengthwise divided into 13 bays by roof trusses with arch-braced collar beams meticulously aligned with the buttresses of the masonry walls. Two transeptal porches in the middle of the barn are original. The masonry of the jambs of the other four entrances is modern; these openings were probably not part of the original structure. The roof is thatched. the parish of Wickham, Essex, there is a barn which in these lease agreements is described as follows: Juxta hoc orreum est aliud, quod habet in longitudine xxx. ped. et dim. preter culacia: et unum calacium est longitudine x. ped. et. dim. Alterum viii. ped. Tota longitudo hujus orrei cum culatiis xlviii. ped. Altitudo sub trabe xi. ped. et dim. et desuper usque ad festum ix. ped., latitudo xx. ped.; nec habet preter i. alam, quae habet in latitudine v. ped. et in altitudine totidem. Hoc orreum debet Ailwinus reddere plenum de mancorno preter medietatem quae est contra ostium, quae debet esse vacua, et haec pars est latitudinis xi. ped. et dim.40 40 Hale, op. cit., 123. Adjacent to this barn there is another one, the length of which is 30½ feet, not counting the lean-to's. One of the lean-to's is 10½ feet deep, the other 8 feet. The total length of the barn, lean-to's included, is 48 feet. The height below the tie beam is 11½ feet, and above, between the tie beam and the ridge, 9 feet. The width [of the nave] is 20 feet. And it has only one aisle, which is 5 feet wide and equally high. This barn Ailwinus must render full of mancorno with the exception of the center bay which lies opposite the entrance and must be left empty, and this part is 11½ feet deep. The barn of Wickham is just a little over half as large as the House for the Cows and Cowherds on the Plan of St. Gall, but its layout is identical. It is noteworthy that the twelfth-century writer in describing this barn makes a clear distinction between the aisle (ala) which is attached to one of the two long sides of the barn and the two leanto's (culatium) which are attached to the narrow ends of the building. In English this distinction is not always maintained. Culatium (from culus = pars cujusvis rei posterior41 41 Du Cange, II, 1937, 653; and Hale, op. cit., lxxvi. ) is a highly descriptive term for that section of the barn which lies under the hipped part of the roof at the short end of the building. The writer also makes a clear distinction between the principal space of the barn, which he refers to simply as "barn" (orreum), and all the peripheral spaces. The dimensions listed for all the constituent parts of the building make it clear that the center space was higher than the surrounding spaces and that it had a double-pitched roof (fig. 485A-D). This is strong evidence for the correctness of our reconstruction of the House for the Cows and Cowherds (fig. 486A-E) and all the other buildings on the Plan which are laid out in a similar manner. PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR HORSES, OXEN, AND THEIR KEEPERS. AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION [1:192] 482.B 482.A LONGITUDINAL SECTION PLAN The only difference between the medieval long houses with transeptal porches shown in figs. 477-481 and the House for Horses and Oxen (fig. 474) is that the latter is furnished with aisles serving as quarters for the oxherds and horse grooms. Traditionally this building type is single-spaced and in this form either used as a dwelling, or for the storage of harvest. Aisles were incorporated in the House for Horses and Oxen because it was intended to accommodate both men and beasts. The total length of this building on the Plan is 145 feet; the living space measures 35 by 37½ feet and the stables each are 52½ feet long, suggesting that the roof-supporting trusses were placed at 11½ foot intervals.

HOUSE FOR HORSES AND OXEN AND THEIR KEEPERS 482.D WEST ELEVATION 482.C EAST ELEVATION SCALE 1/16 INCH EQUALS ONE FOOT [1:192] FOR GRAPHIC SCALE SEE PRECEDING PAGE AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION Our reconstruction of this house as a transeptal space the ridge of which intersects the main ridge at right angles and at the same height, is made in consideration of the fact that the transept extends across the entire width of the structure, bisecting the aisles in which the herdsmen were to sleep. We are also visually emphasizing the great importance of this transept which may have been intended to serve as dining area for all of the monastery's herdsmen (cf. above, p. 278). PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR HORSES AND OXEN AND THEIR KEEPERS NORTH ELEVATION is similar but of opposite hand to the SOUTH ELEVATION 482.F TRANSVERSE SECTION B-B 482.E SOUTH ELEVATION 482.G TRANSVERSE SECTION C-C AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION We saw no functional need to raise the roof over the aisles, where the oxherds and horse grooms were to be quartered, above tie-beam level of the stables. In this same manner bedrooms are treated in all the other guest and service buildings of the Plan. To extend the main roof across the entire width of the building would have been considerably more costly and in construction functionally superfluous—unless one can assume that the full width of the building at floor level was needed as loft above the tie-beam level for storage of straw and hay. PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR COWS AND COWHERDS 483.X SITE PLAN Virtually all of the houses for monastic livestock lie in a large rectangular yard that extends from the entrance Road to the southern edge of the monastery site. They consist of the House for Sheep and Shepherds (No. 35); the House for the Goats and Goatherds (No. 36); the House for the Cows and Cowherds (No. 37); the House for the Swine and Swineherds (No. 39); and the House for Broodmares and Foals and their Keepers (No. 40). The House for Horses and Oxen and their Keepers (No. 33 and fig. 474) lies outside this yard, but adjacent. The layout of the House for Cows and Cowherds is identical with that of the House for Broodmares and Foals and their Keepers as well as with that of the Gardener's House (fig. 426). In each of these structures, the common living room with its traditional open fire place is surrounded with subsidiary outer spaces on three sides only (variant 3B; see above, p. 85, fig. 33). The entrance is in the middle of the long wall where the aisle is missing. As in the House for Distinguished Guests (figs. 396-399), in order to gain access to the stables animals have to be taken through the common living room. For a 12th century structure of the same design see p. 281 and figs. 485. A-D. 484. UTRECHT PSALTER (CA. 830). DEUTERONOMY, XXXII: 1-4 UTRECHT UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, CODEX 32, fol. 86r (detail) [Courtesy of Utrecht University Library] The illusionistic Late Antique style was practiced with superb assurance by the illuminator of the lost manuscript after which the Utrecht Psalter was modeled. Scenes of agricultural life such as this one of a herd of cattle and a man churning butter are of a richness of perception surpassing any other Carolingian manuscript. This intensely classical style disappeared from the medieval scene almost as rapidly as it was adopted, giving way to more abstract concepts of painting. It took close to 500 years of gradual reconquest of reality by art for rural scenes again to be as accurately depicted as in this unique Carolingian manuscript. The marginal scenes of the Luttrell Psalter (figs 467, 475, and 476) are among the high-water marks in this development that, at certain stages, was stimulated by availability of copies of the Utrecht Psalter that were made in England in the 10th and 11th centuries. The lease agreements of St. Paul's date from 1114 to 1155.42 42 For the dates of the leases, see Hale's introductory notes, op. cit., xc-c. Cf. Horn, 1958, 11-12. Obviously, they establish only a terminus ante quam, telling nothing about the age of the barns. Some of them may have been of relatively recent date, others may have been centuries old. V.17.5 HOUSE FOR BROOD MARES, FOALS AND THEIR KEEPERS LAYOUT AND DESIGN Hic fa&amp;as seruabis equas tenerosq· caballos Here you will attend to the brood mares and to their foals The House of Foaling Mares (fig. 487) is identical in plan to that for Cows and Cowherds. In all likelihood it was meant to be the same size. The narrowing of the parchment at the southwestern corner of the Plan, where this building is located, probably forced the copyist to contract the plan for this house. The room that contains the hearth is designated "the horsemen's living room" (domus equaritiae: "the hall of the stables where horses are bred"43 43 For other sources for equaritia, see Niermeyer, 378. In all the houses of the Plan of St. Gall in which animals are kept, they are stabled in the aisles and lean-to's, never in the center room, which is the living room of their keepers. ); aisles and lean-to's that accommodate the horses are designated "stables" (stabula); the cubicles at their end, as "bedrooms for the attendants" (cubit custodum). MATING AND BREEDING Columella, in his book On Agriculture, states that stallions and mares of common stock may be mated at any time during the year, but he advises that the nobler breeds be mated about the time of the spring equinox so that the mares, who foal in the twelfth month, may be able to WICKHAM ST.

PLAN, SECTIONS, AND AXONOMETRIC DRAWINGS SHOWING SKELETAL FRAMING AND EXTERNAL ENVELOPE rear their young when the pasture is rich and grassy. He points out that pregnant mares need special care and generous fodder and ought to be kept in a place that is both roomy and warm.44 44 Columella, On Agriculture, Book VI, chap. 27, ed. cit., 191ff. Modern breeding manuals prescribe that maternity stalls be 12 feet by 12 feet.45 45 Horses and Horsemanship, ed. Ensminger, 1963, 363. If these were the dimensions of the stalls used in the House for Foaling Mares and Foals, it would have been able to provide shelter for eleven mares and their offspring at any given time. The hay, straw, and grain required for these animals were usually stored overhead under the slope of the aisle roof and were fed into the mangers through openings in the floors of these lofts. V.17.6 HOUSE FOR GOATS AND GOATHERDS LAYOUT AND DESIGN Ista domus cunctas nutrit seruat q· capellas This house feeds and shelters all the goats The House for Goats and Goatherds (fig. 489) lies near the House for Cows and Cowherds. Its layout is that of the standard house of the Plan. In the hexameter explaining its function, the word domus appears in the sole context of the Plan where it means the entire building. The living room bears no inscription. It is reached through a vestibule that divides the eastern aisle into two separate chambers used as "bedrooms of the herdsmen" (cubilia pastorum). The lean-to's and the western aisle of the house are designated as "stable" (stabula). The building is 57½ feet long and 45 feet wide. The living room measures 37½ feet by 25 feet. Columella recommends that not more than 100 head of goats be kept in one enclosure. He advises the goatherd to sweep out the stable every day and not allow any ordure or moisture to remain or any mud to form. The she-goats should be covered in the autumn, sometime before December, so that the kids may be born when spring is approaching and the shrubs are budding.46 46 Columella, On Agriculture, Book VII, chap. 6, ed. cit., 279ff. He devotes a whole chapter to the making of goat cheese.47 47 Ibid., chap. 8, 285-89. MANAGEMENT OF SIZE OF HERD The House for the Goats and Goatherds could easily have sheltered one hundred goats. It was probably used primarily for the purpose of milking and breeding the goats. Shortly after the young were born in the spring, and had gathered sufficient strength, they were no doubt taken out to pasture by the goatherds, a breed of men who, Columella stipulates, should be "keen, hardy, and bold . . . the sort of men who can make their way without difficulty over rocks and deserts and through briers . . . men who do not follow the herd like the keepers of other breeds of cattle, but precede it."48 48 Ibid., chap. 6, 281-82. The rooms in the eastern aisle of the House for the Goats and Goatherds on the Plan are large enough to accommodate, besides the permanent goatherds, a considerable number of extra hands who during the warmer months of the year took care of the herds that were out to pasture. MILK PRODUCTION Modern farming manuals state that two reasonably well-bred goats will supply an average household with all the milk it requires and most of the butter, each goat being able to produce 250 gallons of milk or 100 pounds of butter per year.49 49 Farming, ed. Fox, II, 1963. If the House for the Goats and Goatherds sheltered one hundred goats at a time, these animals must have contributed considerably to the monastery's daily supply of cheese. In layout, design, and dimensions, the House for the Goats and Goatherds is identical with the House for Visiting Servants (figs. 402-403), which relieves us of its reconstruction. The same holds true for the two remaining buildings of this tract, which we shall discuss presently. V.17.7 HOUSE FOR SWINE AND SWINEHERDS LAYOUT AND DESIGN Iste sues locus enutrit custodit ad/&amp; ultas50 50 Between custodit and ultas, &amp; is corrected to ad. This place nourishes the [young] pigs [and] guards the mature sows The House for Swine and Swineherds (fig. 491) lies west of the House for the Goats and north of the House for Foaling Mares. Its center room, which has a fireplace, is designated "the hall of the swineherds" (domus porcariorum). The east aisle contains a vestibule and the "bedrooms of the herdsmen" (cubil pastorum). The west aisle and the lean-to's are not designated. There can be no doubt, however, about their function. In all the other houses, this area was reserved for the animals. A FARROWING PEN The House for Swine and Swineherds, as its explanatory title states, was primarily a farrowing pen. It was the place where the sows were kept during the winter—those sows, that is, who would produce the litters to make up the subsequent year's herds. All other pigs were slaughtered in December.51 51 Cf. I, pp. 305-307. The number of pigs that could be housed together is determined by available trough space. Feed PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR THE COWS AND COWHERDS 486.B EAST ELEVATION 486.A PLAN AUTHORS' INTERPRETATION In reconstructing this building we were in principle guided by the same criteria that governed reconstruction of the House of the Gardener and his Crew (figs. 427. A-F), but because this house is the larger by over twice the area of the former structure, we decided to furnish it with a hipped roof on the supposition that it would be needed for greater wind resistance. As for all structures housing both men and animals on the Plan, it was necessary to lead animals to their stalls directly through the common living area used by the herders, whose sleeping quarters in the aisles may have been divided from the stalls by little more than a partition. 486.D TRANSVERSE SECTION B-B 486.C LONGITUDINAL SECTION A-A 486.E NORTH ELEVATION The habit and custom of housing beasts in close contact with man was of centuries' long standing in Northern Europe. Even in the sophisticated House for Distinguished Guests (Building 11; cf. fig. 396, p. 146), 9th-century social amenities did not yet preclude the arrangement whereby the visitors' horses were led through the common living and dining area to their stalls. The length of the center space of the House for Cows and Cowherds is 52½, feet, suggesting that its roof supporting posts were to be spaced at 10½-foot intervals, or within the normal range for bay division in a building of this kind. PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR FOALING MARES AND THEIR KEEPERS 487. 487.X Lying in the extreme southwest corner of the site, the layout of this structure in all of its basic dispositions is identical with that of the House for Cows and Cowherds. Virtually without question it was intended to be the same size, but, falling at a point on the tracing where the parchment corner tapers, the draftsman of the Plan was doubtless compelled to reduce the size of the building slightly in accommodation to the limitations of his sheet. All the larger breeds of livestock were quartered in separate facilities lying in close proximity to one another. Outlines on the Plan indicate that they were separated by fences or other partitions from one another. During the winter, animals would be confined to their stalls; in spring they could be taken to pasture through secondary exits in the peripheral wall enclosure (which are not shown on the Plan). Horses and oxen kept in these facilities would be used as draft animals, the former perhaps for riding; the cattle for breeding and milking; the mares exclusively for breeding. As regards the inclusion of a stud in a monastic community, the relationship of monastic with crown services and economics is discussed in Volume I, Chapter IV, "The Monastic Polity." 488. UTRECHT PSALTER (CA. 830). PSALM LXXII (73) UTRECHT UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, CODEX 32, fol. 41v (detail) [Courtesy of the Utrecht University Library] This detail is one of the most interesting examples of the method used by the illuminator of the original Late Antique manuscript (after which the Utrecht Psalter was modeled) to convey general concepts in imagery taken from man's daily life. Verse 22 of the psalm, "So foolish was I and ignorant; I was as a beast before thee", serves to embody the concept "beast" in the touching representation of a mare suckling her foal. In this manner the illuminator transmitted to the Middle Ages a composition borrowed from one of the best periods of Roman painting. It has a striking counterpart in a painting from Herculaneum (now in Naples, Museo Nazionale) showing a doe suckling Telephos (see L. Curtius, Die Wandmalerei Pompejis, Leipzig, 1929 8, fig. 5). pigs require an average of 12 inches of trough space; sows and boars, 18 inches. The required sleeping and feeding area is 6 square feet per pig. The minimum farrowing pen is 5 feet square. There should also be a dung passage 3 to 4 feet wide.52 52 See Farming, ed. Fox, II, 1963, 415, and Fream, 1962, 661ff. If the area available for pigs in the House for Swine and Swineherds on the Plan were to be divided into farrowing pens 5 feet square, it would accommodate twenty-one sows with litters (five under each lean-to; eleven in the aisle). If the housing capacity were to be calculated on the basis of the available square footage, without allowing extra space for litters, the number of pigs could easily be doubled. MEAT FOR THE SERFS, AND FOR THE YOUNG AND SICK MONKS In the Middle Ages swine and sheep were the chief animals raised for meat. Many monasteries maintained large herds of both, often under the supervision of the monks themselves. Swine and sheep were also favorite items of tithing. In the deeds of the monastery of St. Gall, published by Hermann Wartmann, sucklings, yearlings, and fully fattened sows are often part of the regular deliveries from villagers and other tenants. In calculating these tithes, a distinction was made between the heavy winter swine, which had been fattened on acorns and beechnuts while out to pasture in the forest, and the leaner and less desirable summer swine. In years when the weather PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR GOATS AND GOATHERDS 489. 489.X SITE PLAN The House for Goat and Goatherds (36) lies next to that for cattle and cowherds (37) and in the same row of buildings. Its layout is identical with that of the House for Sheep and Shepherds (35) north of it, that for swine and their herdsmen (39) west of it, and the House for Servants from Outlying Estates (38), whose reconstruction (below, p. 157, fig. 403. A-D) is applicable to all of these installations of the Plan. These structures are straightforward examples of what in our previous discussion we have referred to as the "standard house" of the Plan of St. Gall (i.e., Variant 4; see above, p. 85, fig. 334). Ranged side by side in two rows, with a sense of symmetry that clearly had a classical touch, they appear to us almost as a village arranged by the ordering mind of an urban planner. For earlier and later examples of non-monastic clusters of this type, see figures 259, 335, and 336. 490. UTRECHT PSALTER (CA. 830). PSALM XXII (23) UTRECHT UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, CODEX 32, fol. 45r (detail) [Courtesy of Utrecht University Library] The five goats grazing on a hillside are part of a larger scene; it includes a herd of cattle and flock of sheep by the banks of a stream, to illustrate verses 1 and 2 of the psalm: "The Lord is my shepherd . . . . " The pen-and-ink depiction of these goats, two of which rise on their hind legs reaching as high as they can to crop the choice leaves, and snapping at each other in their greed, is a display of posture and behavior so distinctively of goats that it places this scene among the outstanding pictorial accomplishments of the Carolingian Renascence—a stunning revival in the scriptorium of Reims (816-835) of a type of pictorial illusionism that even in Late Antiquity was practised only by artists of the greatest skill and accomplishment. favored the fattening of swine, the tithe was exacted in kind; in years when the growth was lean, the monks preferred the corresponding value in currency or in sheep (quando esca est porcum solido valentem I, et quando esca non est arietum bonum).53 53 Wartmann, I, 1863, 58, No. 58, and 120, No. 506. Cf. Bikel, 1914, 11. A vital prerequisite for the raising of herds of swine by the monastery itself was the possession of forests, which might be placed under the care of "monastic foresters" (forestarii). A guarded copse of wood, reserved for the specific purpose of fattening swine (quaedam silvula ob porcorum pastum custodiebatur), is mentioned in the Life of St. Gall and was apparently the scene of a number of miracles, all of which perhaps tends to stress the idea that this branch of the monastery's agricultural economy held no insignificant place.54 54 Vita sancti Galli, chap. 61, ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1870, 82. Although the meat from quadrupeds was a staple in the diet of the monastery's serfs and workmen, for the monks themselves it was allowed only in their early childhood and in times of illness.55 55 Cf. I, 277, 313, 314; and above, p. 264. This rule appears to have been violated with such frequency, however, that the monastery of St. Gall itself, toward the end of the tenth century, drew upon itself the anger and criticism of Abbot Ruodman (972-986) of the neighboring monastery of Reichenau. Ruodman's critical testimony before the Emperor Otto II resulted in a number of imperial investigations into the conditions at PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR SWINE AND SWINEHERDS 491. 491.X SITE PLAN In medieval illustrated calendars, the slaughtering of swine at the onset of winter, when pasture in the nearby woods became impossible, was a favorite subject for portrayal for the month of December. In a monastic community, only those sows and boars were wintered that would produce the litter of animals to be raised in the subsequent year. Carcasses of the slaughtered pigs were intended to be hung in the Monks' Larder; for a realistic description of how this was done, see I, 305-307, and Adalhard's directives in the Customs of Corbie, in the chapter devoted to swine (translated, III, 118f.) 492. UTRECHT PSALTER (CA. 830). PSALM LXXIX (80) UTRECHT, UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, CODEX 32, fol. 47r (detail) [Courtesy of the Utrecht University Library] The picture, drawn in the most delicate scatter of lines, depicts the powerful bulk of a large boar devouring the boughs of a spiraling vine. It is an illustration to the lament of the Psalmist over his people having fallen in God's disfavor: "Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the heathen and planted it" (verse 8); "The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly cedars" (verse 10); "Why hast thou then broken down her hedges so that all they which pass by the way do pluck her? The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of the field doth devour it" (verses 12-13). St. Gall. Ekkehart, in his Casus sancti Galli, does not overlook the opportunity to describe these investigations with color and tendentious distortion.56 56 Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, chaps. 91ff, ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 332ff; ed. Helbling, 1958, 164ff. (See especially chap. 100). V.17.8 HOUSE FOR SHEEP AND SHEPHERDS LAYOUT AND DESIGN Hic caulas ouium caute dispone tuarum Here lay out with care the enclosures of your sheep The House for Sheep and Shepherds (fig. 493) lies between the Goat House and the road leading to the Church. Its center room is labeled simply "the main room" (ipsa domusm);57 57 Domum corrected into domus; but the m not struck out. the chambers to the left and right of the entrance, as "bedrooms of the shepherds" (cubilia opilionum); the U-shaped area around the living room, as "sheepfold" (caulae; see fig. 493).58 58 The last two letters of caulae (in the southern lean-to) are barely visible. The position of this house near the Church may reflect the symbolic identification of the Good Shepherd with Christ, and sheep with the faithful. PLAN OF ST. GALL. HOUSE FOR SHEEP AND SHEPHERDS 493. 493.X SITE PLAN Sheep and goats were the smaller livestock accommodated by facilities on the Plan of St. Gall; then, as now, they remain important as a kind of all-purpose animal, their by-products of milk, wool or hair, and meat being prime resources in the life of any self-sustaining community. In the partly or fully nomadic civilizations of the ancient Near East, power and social standing depended to a large extent on the number and size of flocks an individual owned. The care and protection of these creatures called for men of brave, hardy disposition, exacting vigilance, and unremitting devotion. The image of men so qualified who performed these important tasks impressed itself on the inhabitants of the two great Near Eastern river valleys and their hinterlands with such force that it became an integral part of the concept of sovereignty associated with ancient kings and gods who, in official imagery, were portrayed holding shepherds' staffs. The concept was inherited by Christianity and brought close to every faithful soul through the famous parable (Luke 15: 4-7) in which the Good Shepherd, in forgiving a repentant sinner, rejoicing carries the lost sheep back to the fold. The Church became the herd of God, the sheep, believers. Later, bishops and abbots both adopted the shepherd's staff as ceremonial emblem of their leadership and guardianship within the Church 494. UTRECHT PSALTER (CA. 830). PSALM L (51) UTRECHT, UNIVERSITY LIBRARY, CODEX 32, fol. 29r (detail) [Courtesy of the Utrecht University Library] Nathan is portrayed beside a flock of sheep, goats, and cows. Portions not illustrated here show the parable of the ewe-lamb; and Nathan upbraiding King David for having Uriah slain and taken Bathsheba his wife—events that occurred when Psalm L was written, and which are described in II Samuel, xi-xiii. MEAT, MILK, AND WOOL Like goats, sheep were valued both for their meat and as milk-producing animals. These values, plus that of their skin for the making of parchment and their wool for blankets and winter clothing, made them one of the most useful species of animals to the monastic economy. As was true of the other animals, the amount of cheese that could be obtained from the monastery's own flocks was augmented by deliveries from outlying pastures and possessions. The monastery of Corbie maintained ten flocks of sheep, which supplied the monastery with cheese in the summer, and Adalhard of Corbie in his Administrative Directives sets out in great detail the manner in which the sheep, as well as all of the monastery's other livestock, should be tithed.59 59 Consuetudines Corbeienses, chap. 6 (De bestiis decimandis), ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 395ff, and translation, III, 114. A fully grown sheep requires a floor area of 4 to 6 feet square.60 60 Fream, 1962, 84ff. The floor space available in the aisle and under the lean-to's of the House for Sheep would have accommodated a flock of seventy to one hundred sheep. In Biblical times, wealth was equated with large flocks. Images of sheep, shepherds, and flocks recur throughout the joys and laments of the Psalms. Their symbolic values of spiritual wealth were carried forward into monastic recitations of these songs (see caption, fig. 261, I, 346) and into the canon of illustrations deemed appropriate for books such as the Utrecht Psalter. 495. PLAN OF ST. GALL INDIVIDUAL PRIVIES DIRECTLY ATTACHED TO ROOMS OR HOUSES OF LODGING V. 18 SANITARY FACILITIES V.18.1 CLEANLINESS AND GODLINESS A word must be said about the contrivances which in both medieval and modern Anglo Saxon literature are referred to with the evasive designations "garderobe," "privy," or "rere-dorter,"1 1 Cf. Salzman, 1952, 281ff. and in the explanatory titles of the Plan of St. Gall are varyingly designated as exitus, exitus necessarius, necessari?, and requisitum naturae. On first inspection the subject is somewhat bewildering, since in certain areas of the Plan provisions for this facility are made with a profuseness that exceeds any comparable modern standards of hygiene, while in others they appear to be wholly overlooked. A more judicious examination discloses that the measure of attention lavished on the privies by the designer of the Plan of St. Gall is directly related to the rank or administrative status that their beneficiaries hold in the monastic polity. The subject has both social and philosophical implications and throws some light upon the history of western hygiene. V.18.2 TWO BASIC TYPES OF PRIVIES INDIVIDUAL PRIVIES Individual privies directly attached to the house or an apartment, containing either one or more toilet seats, are at the disposition of visiting noblemen (fig. 495A) and those monastic functionaries who, because of their specific responsibilities, must live in separate quarters outside the claustrum, viz., the Porter (fig. 495B), the master of the Outer School (fig. 495B), the master of the novices, (fig. 495C), the chief physician (fig. 495D). They are also installed for small groups of regular monks who are not part of the monastic community, such as the visiting monks (fig. 495E), and those being segregated for health reasons, such as the sick novices (fig. 495C) or the acutely ill patients in the House of the Physicians (fig. 495D). COMMUNAL PRIVIES Apart from these private toilets directly attached to the bedrooms of their respective users, there are others installed in greater quantities in separate outhouses located directly behind the buildings they serve. The largest among these is the privy for the servants at the House for Distinguished Guests (fig. 496A). It is 10 feet wide, 45 feet long, and contains eighteen toilet seats. Next in size is the privy for the students of the Outer School, which measures 10 feet by 37½ feet and is furnished with fifteen seats (fig. 496B). Then follows in order of decreasing magnitude: the privy of the House for Bloodletting, with seven seats (fig. 496C); the privy of the Abbot's House, with six seats (fig. 496D); and the privies of the Novitiate and the Infirmary, each with six seats (fig. 496E). The Monks' Privy (fig. 497) falls into a category by itself; like the other collective privies of the Plan, it is a separate house, but it does not have their narrow, elongated floor plan; instead, it is almost square. It measures 30 feet by 40 feet, provides for a total of nine seats (sedilia), a stand for a lantern (lucerna), and three other facilities of oblong shape, whose function remains unexplained. DIFFERENT ORIGINS The small individual privies of the distinguished guests and the higher monastic officials (fig. 495, A-E) doubtlessly, have their prototypes in the vernacular architecture of the upper strata of Carolingian society. The longhouse for the servants of the distinguished guests, the students of the Outer School, and other smaller monastic groups (figs. 496, A-E), I would be inclined to derive from Roman and medieval military architecture, although I cannot support this hypothesis with any tangible archaeological evidence. The square shape of the Monk's Privy is somewhat reminiscent of that of the Roman public latrine, but may actually not be in any ancestral relation to the latter, and may owe its squarish shape to the desire to add to the single row of toilet seats such other facilities as a urinal or troughs with water for washing hands. V.18.3 SANITARY FACILITIES OF THE PLAN IN THE LIGHT OF ANCIENT AND MODERN STANDARDS OF HYGIENE The sanitary installations of the Plan of St. Gall raise the interesting question of environmental hygiene in a planned medieval community of men that can be placed into proper historical perspective only if analyzed in comparison with ancient and modern facilities of this type. THE PUBLIC ROMAN LATRINE The public Roman latrine consisted of a large space, usually square (fig. 499) but often trapezoidal or semicircular (fig. 500A), or a combination of such shapes (fig. 500B). The seats were ranged along the walls all around the periphery of the building, leaving everyone fully exposed to the view of the others, with sufficient floor space in between for people to congregate in amicable conversation. Channels beneath the seats, flushed by running water diverted from the aqueducts, drained into the public sewer system. The seating capacity of these buildings could attain substantial proportions. The gymnasium of the city of Philippi had a latrine with fifty seats. In the market of Miletus there was one with forty (fig. 499A-B); in the 496. PLAN OF ST. GALL PRIVIES CONSTRUCTED AS SEPARATE HOUSES CONNECTED WITH THE BUILDINGS THEY SERVE BY COVERED PASSAGES 497. PLAN OF ST. GALL MONKS' PRIVY Comparison with later monastic architecture (figs. 501-503 and 516-520) suggests that the Monks' Privy was level with the Dormitory, a relationship we misinterpreted in the Aachen model of the Plan in 1965, and have corrected here. Waste was either to accumulate in a cesspool at ground level, later to be used as fertilizer in the garden nearby; or, less likely, flushed away by a water channel. The Privy is 30 feet wide, 40 feet long (12 modules wide by 16 long) and has 9 toilet seats and 3 stands serving as urinals or washbasins. In these measurements, multiples of 3, 4, and 10 may indicate the pervasiveness of the concept of sacred numbers even in so humble a facility. Agora of Athens, one with sixty-four.2 2 For a recent review of this material see von Salis, 1947, 26ff. The Romans seemingly had settled this public need with the same flair with which they engineered a world-wide system of roads, constructed their aqueducts, and installed grandiose systems for metropolitan sewage disposal—engineering feats so great and new in concept that the Greek philosopher Strabo (b. 63 B.C.) could remark that "if the Greeks had the repute of aiming most happily in the founding of cities, in that they aimed at beauty, strength of position, and the availability of harbours and productive soil, the Romans had the best foresight in . . . the construction of roads and aqueducts, and of sewers that could wash out the filth of the city into the Tiber."3 3 Strabo Geographica, Book V; The Geography of Strabo, ed. Jones, II, 1923, 405. Yet as magnificent as all this appears on first sight, in terms of effective environmental hygiene, it was far from providing a satisfactory solution to the sewage disposal needed in the larger Roman cities. Besides the public latrines, only the houses of the patricians were linked to the metropolitan water system. The inhabitants of the tenements, where the remaining two million Romans lived, had to carry their domestic ordure in pots to a sewage vat under the stairwell, bring it to nearby cesspits (with which Rome was riddled), or take recourse to the even more primitive method of simply dumping their offal from the windows into the street. Much of Rome wallowed in filth.4 4 For succinct and colorful reviews of these conditions, see Carcopino, 1960, 39ff; and Mumford, 1961, 214ff. RATIO OF TOILET SEATS TO NUMBER OF USERS On the Plan of St. Gall If one analyzes on the Plan of St. Gall the ratio between the number of toilet seats provided for the disposal of human waste and the number of potential users, one arrives at the startling conclusion that the standards of sanitary hygiene in a medieval monastery of the time of Louis the Pious were far advanced not only over those of any of their classical proto- or antitypes, but—with the sole exception of modern de luxe hotels—even conspicuously superior to common standards of modern sanitation. The House for Distinguished Guests, as we saw, had bedding facilities for eight noblemen and eighteen servants. Since the bedrooms for the noblemen were equipped with their own privies, the eighteen seats of the outhouse must have been the reserve of the eighteen servants.5 5 Cf. above, pp. 155-65. They were set up at a ratio of 1:1. On the level of the court this appears to have been the norm. The royal guesthouse of the monastery of Cluny, a facility which was designed for the accommodation of seventy guests, was furnished with the same number of toilet seats.6 6 Cf. above, pp. 277 and below, 332-33. The Outer School of the Plan of St. Gall, designed for an occupancy of probably twenty-four students, has an outhouse equipped with fifteen seats (fig. 496B),7 7 Cf. above, pp. 172-75. which yields a ratio of 1:1.6. The House for Bloodletting, probably never occupied simultaneously by more than twelve monks,8 8 Cf. above, pp. 184-88. has seven seats (fig. 496C); it therefore had a probable ratio of 1:1.7. The Abbot's House with a bedding capacity of eight9 9 Cf. above, I, 321-25. has six toilet seats (fig. 496D), yielding a ratio of 1:1.3. And the dormitories of the Novitiate and the Infirmary, each of which appear to have been designed for an occupancy of twelve persons,10 10 Cf. above, I, 311-21. are provided with an outhouse equipped with six seats, corresponding to a ratio of 1:2. In modern building codes To place these figures into proper perspective from the point of view of environmental sanitation, it may be pointed out that the latest U.S. Army Field Manual 21-10 on Military Sanitation prescribes eight toilet seats for every 100 men.11 11 United States Department of the Army, Field Manual, 21-10, Military Sanitation, 1957, 78ff. In World War II, it was ten seats for every 200 men.12 12 United States Army, Medical Department, Preventive Medicine in World War II, II: Environmental Hygiene, Office of the Surgeon General (Washington, D.C., 1955), 149. The Uniform Housing Code of 1961 in section H 505 recommends for hotels one toilet seat per ten guests;13 13 Uniform Housing Code, published by the International Conference of Building Officials (Los Angeles, 1961), Section H 505. and the California Administrative Code, Title 17, as of 1966 stipulates that in camps, toilets should be provided at the ratio of one toilet seat per fifteen occupants of the camp.14 14 California Administrative Code, Title 17, Public Health, State of California Documents Section (Sacramento, 1966), 597. The luxury of modern hotels, where each 498. OSTIA. ROMAN PUBLIC LATRINE (4TH CENT. A.D.) This latrine, part of a larger campaign, was built when the forum baths of Ostia were restored in the 4th century. It is among the best preserved Roman latrines. Facilities of this type, preceded by a vestibule and entered, as here, by a revolving door were by preference built near the forum or near baths. This latrine had seats of marble over a water-flushed channel. In private Roman homes the privy was always next to or in the kitchen, making it possible for one drainage ditch to service both, and the bath as well. Movable receptacles were often installed beneath chairs and placed in the street at night, the waste to be collected by the CONDUCTOR FORICORUM. Amphoras serving as public urinals were posted by the fullers throughout the streets; their content was used in the process of cleaning cloth. bedroom is provided with a private bath and a private toilet, is of relatively recent date. Even today in the majority of smaller European hotels an entire floor is served by a single privy at the end of the corridor. The ratio between available seats and their potential occupants varies anywhere between 1:10 to 1:30. In the light of these statistics, the hygiene of the monastery shown on the Plan of St. Gall must be proclaimed to be superior to that prevailing under average conditions in most Western countries today. They fall short only if measured against conditions prevalent in the most elegant, modern hotels. The most conservative arrangement on the Plan of St. Gall is the privy of the regular monks, which is furnished with nine toilets serving a total of seventy-seven monks, thus yielding a ratio of 1:8.5. Yet even this is still considerably more generous than the ratio of 1:12 stipulated today in the sanitary code of the U.S. Army. MILETOS, ASIA MINOR, WEST COAST NEAR SAMOS 499.B PERSPECTIVE, CUTAWAY 499.C TRANSVERSE SECTION 499.A PLAN NORTH MARKET HALL. PUBLIC LATRINE (3rd-4th cent.) The latrine seats were cut into marble slabs and were placed over a water channel. The 44 keyhole-shaped seats aligned with a slot in the vertical face of the bank of seats to allow the user access for cleansing. An open channel cut into the slightly slanting marble floor in front of and parallel to the seats carried water for cleansing the hands (after von Gerkan, 1922, 18, figs., 20-21). V.18.4 SUPERIOR STANDARDS OF SANITATION: COLLECTIVE PLANNING AND CHRISTIAN RETICENCE THE MONASTERY: A PLANNED SOCIETY The basic ecological reason for these comparatively high standards of monastic sanitation are easy to define: in contrast to the medieval or classical city, whose growth was subject to pressures beyond the control of its inhabitants, the monastery was a planned society. Its population was stable, and in general not subject to unexpected fluctuations.15 15 Compare the interesting remarks of Abbot Adalhard of Corbie on the fluctuation of the number of men to be fed in his monastery, quoted I, 342-43; and translation, III, 106-107. The same care that was used in regulating the spiritual life of the community, therefore, could also be applied to the organization of its physical environment. DIFFERENCE IN UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHICAL CONCEPTS There are other reasons, moreover, of a deeper and more philosophical nature that made it necessary for this side of life to be carefully ordered. The classical civilizations of Greece and Rome, affirmative in their response to the human organism and the pleasures derived from it, reacted to the problem of evacuation of human waste with the same naturalness with which they responded to the phenomenon of eating or breathing. To the Christian mind, taught to "chastise the body" and to "deny the desires of the flesh,"16 16 Benedicti regula, chap. 4.11 (corpus castigare) and chap. 4.59 (desideria carnis non efficere), ed. Hanslik, 1960, 30; ed. McCann, 1963, 26-27; ed. Steidle, 110 and 113. it was, by contrast, an indignity inflicted upon man because his soul was condemned to reside in a body. This different concept is as manifest in the terminology used to define this physiological inevitability as it is in the layout of the building devised for its accommodation. The classical languages are clear, descriptive, and to the point on this matter.17 17 I refer the reader to the words listed under the headings "urinate" and "void excrements" in Buck, 1949, 273 and 275, as well as their equivalents and variants listed in Schmidt, Synonymik der Griechischen Sprache. The monastic language, as one is not surprised to find, is reticent but not prudish. St. Benedict coined the evasive phrase ad necessaria naturae exire ("to go out for the necessities of nature")18 18 Benedicti regula, chap. 8, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 53; ed. McCann, 1963, 48-49; ed. Steidle, 1945, 145. which becomes the base for numerous insignificant variations subsequently used, such as necessitas fratrum,19 19 Ordo Romanus, xviii, ed. Semmler, in Corp. cons. mon., I, 1963, 49. corporis necessaria,20 20 Theodomari epistola, ibid., 135. corporea necessitas naturae,21 21 Memoriale Qualiter, ibid., 292. necessitas naturae;22 22 Acta Preliminaria, chap. 26, ed. Semmler, ibid., 449. or the variants necessarium, exitus necessarius, or requisitum naturae used on the Plan of St. Gall—a terminology designed to express the inescapable condition of the function it denotes. The needs to which he attends in the privy were not only the lowest of all activities in which a monk was bound to engage, but were also a source of mortal danger. The light shown on the Plan of St. Gall as an obligatory piece of equipment in the Monks' Privy is a precautionary measure aimed at more than merely protecting the monks from stumbling in a physical sense.23 23 It is significant that the reform abbot, Ruodman of Reichenau, during a secret nocturnal visit to the abbey of St. Gall, chose one of the seats of the monks' latrine as a vantage point of improper monastic conduct. For more details on this see I, 261-62. Besides his bed and his bath, this was the only other place where, by no fault of his own, he could not avoid bodily contact with himself. Like the temptations of the dormitory and of the bathhouse, the temptations of the privy could only be met with the most stringent of directives for conditions and time of use— especially strict in the case of the younger monks. We learn more about these from Carolingian commentaries to the Rule of St. Benedict than from the Rule itself.24 24 Cf. the rules mentioned by Hildemar, concerning the behavior of monks, especially the younger ones, in visiting the necessarium by night, discussed in I, 252-53. ARCHITECTURAL IMPLICATIONS It is clear that this change in attitude would also have its effect on the architectural layout of the monastic privy. The amphitheater-style layout of the public Roman latrine with its convivial sociability had no chance of survival in this new environment. The prescribed and proper deportment of the monk required that he draw his cowl over his head, so as not to be recognized.25 25 Usus antiquiores ordinis cisterciensis, part I, chap. 72, ed. Julianus Paris, 1664; ed. Hugo Séjalon, 1892, 172. To expose himself freely to the view of others, or be exposed to theirs, would have been an act of blasphemy. This is unquestionably the reason why the seats of the monastic privies of the Middle Ages were stretched out in a single line in an elongated structure that had more the character of a corridor than of a room, and where any propensity toward social intercourse was frustrated by the establishment of separating cross partitions. V.18.5 MEDIEVAL PARALLELS MONKS' LATRINE IN THE MONASTERY OF CLUNY II The longhouse became the preferred medieval form for monastic latrines. The earliest prose description of this type of building known to me is that of the monks' latrine in the monastery of Cluny II. The author of the Consuetudines Farfenses, writing around 1043, defines it as follows: 500. PIAZZA ARMERINA. PROVINCE OF ENNA, SICILY VILLA OF EMPEROR MAXIMIANUS, †310 A.D. [Redrawn from Gentili &amp; Bandinelli, 1956] 1:600 The villa, probably an imperial hunting lodge, consisted of clusters of rectangular and curved-wall buildings laid out on shifting axes around a large galleried court containing a fountain. Its most prominent architectural features are the emperor's audience hall (BASILICA) at the eastern end of the court, his dining hall (TRICLINIUM) to the north, and an elaborate cold and warm water bath (FRIGIDARIUM, TEPIDARIUM) at the southeastern corner of the complex near its entrance. The residential quarters lay to the south side of the court and audience hall. The latrines were judiciously sited: a large one next to the baths, probably the first to be used by returning hunters, and a smaller one near the living quarters, in a wedge-shaped space between QUADRIPORTICUS and thermal installations. Their amphitheatrical layout allowed users to attend to their needs in full view of everyone else—a reflection of the unihibited affirmation with which the ancients responded to the body's natural functions, and an attitude quite opposed to the reticent privacy and hierarchical social segregation with which these facilities are treated in the repressing ambience of a medieval monastery. 501. CLUNY II. MONKS' PRIVY (ODILO'S MONASTERY, 994-1049). PLAN AFTER DESCRIPTION IN THE CONSUETUDINES FARFENSES The location of the latrine at Cluny is ascertained by excavation of its foundations. It lay at right angles to the monks' dormitory at a distance of about 1·50m from it, and was accessible through its southern gable wall by a connecting bridge at dormitory level. The dormitory itself occupied the upper level of a long structure that bounded the claustral complex to the east. For more detail, see Conant's reconstruction of the layout of Cluny II shown in fig. 515, and his description of Odilo's work in Conant, 1968, 59-67. "The latrine of the monks is 70 feet long, 23 feet wide. In the building there have been arranged 45 seats with a small window above each seat, 2 feet high, 1½ feet wide. Above these are wooden structures, and above this wooden construction there are seventeen windows, 3 feet high, 1½ feet wide" (Latrina LXXta pedes longitudinis, latitudinis XXti et tres; sellae XL et quinque in ipsa domo ordinatae sunt, et per unamquamque sellam aptata est fenestrula in muro altitudinis pedes duo, latitudinis semissem unum, et super ipsas sellulas compositas strues lignorum, et super ipsas constructionem lignorum facte sunt fenestrae Xeë et VIItë, altitudinis tres pedes, latitudinis pedem et semissem).26 26 Consuetudines Farfenses, ed. Albers, Cons. mon., I, 1900, 137. The specifications for this building disclose a perspicacious awareness of the need for light and ventilation: two tiers of windows, sixty-seven in all. Since each seat is provided with its own window the latrines must have been ranged along the outer walls of the building, as shown in figure 501, which is based on the dimensions recorded in the Farfa text and the assumption of a surface area 2½ feet square for each seat. THE MONKS' LATRINE OF CHRISTCHURCH MONASTERY AT CANTERBURY An early graphical portrayal of such a latrine is the Norman necessarium shown on the famous plan of the waterworks of the monastery of Christchurch, Canterbury (fig. 502), drawn around 1165 by Wibert or one of his assistants.27 27 Two plans of the waterworks of the monastery of Christchurch are inserted into the Canterbury Psalter on fol. 284v and fol. 285; see James, 1935, last two plates; for more details on these plans see I, 68-70. The foundations and lower portions of the walls of this privy survive (fig. 503). It was 145 feet long and 25 feet wide (internal measurements) and in its original form contained fifty-five toilet seats in a single room, at intervals of 2 feet, 7 inches, measuring the seats on their centers. The seats were supported by fifty-three transverse arches which bridged a fosse flushed by running water.28 28 For a detailed description of the rere-dorter of Christchurch monastery, see Willis, 1868, 85ff. OTHER MONASTIC PRIVIES AND WATER-FLUSHED CHANNELS FOR WASTE The remains of many other structures of this kind, dating from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, may be found in other English monasteries, such as Kirkstall, Fountains, Lewes Priory, Rievaulx, Roche, and Byland; an unusually fine Continental specimen exists in the Abbey of Maubuisson.29 502. CHRISTCHURCH, CANTERBURY, ENGLAND, PLAN OF WATERWORKS (CA. 1165) MONKS' PRIVY (DETAIL, ACTUAL SIZE) [By courtesy of the Trustees of Trinity College Library, Cambridge University] The plan, probably drawn by Wibert (d. 1167), who engineered the system, shows the privy lying at the southern side of the CURIA at right angles to the Norman dormitory (DORMITORIUM). With an external length of 155 feet (more than double the length of the monks' privy at Cluny), and a height of 35 feet, it was an imposing structure. The artist took license in portraying the Christchurch privy as a detached building; remaining fragments of the masonry of dormitory and privy show that in reality a portion of its western gable wall butted against the dormitory and was accessible from it through a connecting vestibule (fig. 503.A). The privy was water-flushed down its length by means of a drainage ditch that, on the drawing, is shown to run parallel to and outside the structure; in actuality this channel passed beneath it (fig. 503. B, C) and emptied into the fosse of the city wall. After the dissolution of the monasteries in England by Henry VIII, the privy was converted into a common hall for minor canons and officers of the choir. So it remained with slight modifications until 1850, when it was taken down. Some of the masonry of the fosse and many of the arches that supported the privy seats (fig. 503.C) are part of the surviving ruins and can still be seen. The complete plan of the Christchurch waterworks is reproduced in Volume I of this work, pp. 70-71, and is part of a discussion of schematic waterways as they might apply to Christchurch; the discussion includes a schematic speculation of watercourses that might be applicable to the St. Gall site (I, 72, and 74, fig. 53). 503.A CANTERBURY, CHRISTCHURCH MONASTERY, MONKS' PRIVY. PLAN [after Willis, 1868, fig. 12] The designations are misleading. The "Third Dormitory" was not a hall for sleeping, but a latrine. The "Second Dormitory" may have served as sleeping quarters for certain conventual officers, such as sacristan, chamberlain, cellerar, and superior. 29 For Kirkstall, see St. John Hope and Bilson, 1907, 73ff; for Fountains, Wainwright, 1962, 47-48; for Lewes Priory, Godfrey, 1933, 23; for Rievaulx, Peers, 1934, 8; for Roche, Thomson, 1962, 11; for Byland, Peers, 1952, 9; for Maubuisson, Lenoir, II, 1856, 367. In all of these establishments the rere-dorters were cleansed by running water diverted from a natural stream at some point above the monastery and returned to it with the waste further down the valley. There is no doubt in my mind that the majority of the privies shown on the Plan of St. Gall were cleansed in this manner, although the author of the Plan refrained from delineating the course of such a water system. What he had in mind can be elicited from the fact that the majority of his privies are sited in such a manner that they could be flushed in succession by a drainage channel connecting them in a straight course.30 30 For more general remarks on the monastic waterways, see I, 68-70. VARIATION IN ARRANGEMENT OF SEATS An interesting, and possibly common, variation of the longhouse represented by the rere-dorter of the monastery of Christchurch in Canterbury (figs. 502-503) was created by moving the row of toilet seats away from the wall into the center axis of the building and making each alternate seat accessible from the opposite side. We have the good fortune of being able to visualize the furnishings of such a privy down to its minutest detail because of the survival, in the Collection of Drawings of the British Museum, of a set of meticulously measured drawings made by J. G. Buckler in 1868, before the interior of the longhouse of New College, Oxford, was gutted to make room for more modern installations.31 31 London, British Museum, Collection of Drawings, Add. Ms. 36437. Buckler, Architectural Drawings, Miscellaneous, vol. VIII, fols. 271-86. The existence of these drawings seems to have escaped the historiographers of Oxford. They are mentioned neither in the chapter on New College of the Victoria History of the Counties of England, Oxfordshire, III, 1954, 144-62, nor in A. H. Smith's New College and its Buildings (Oxford Univ. Press, 1952). Although this type does not appear on the Plan of St. Gall, the furnishings as such may well reflect a very old tradition. In the annals of New College the rere-dorter of New College, varyingly referred to as domicilium necessarium and as "longhouse," was part of the quadrangle complex built by Bishop Wykeham from 1380 to 1386. It is 16 feet, 2 inches wide and 82 feet long (clear inner measurements; the external dimensions are 22 feet, 9 inches by 89 feet, 4 inches) and was built two stories high with walls 3 feet thick. The lower story originally had no openings and served as a cesspool, which was periodically cleaned.32 32 VHC, op. cit., 149. The upper story, approached by an external stair, was lit by narrow slit windows with a wide internal splay. In the axis of the room throughout its entire length CANTERBURY, CHRISTCHURCH MONASTERY. MONKS' PRIVY 503.B TRANSVERSE SECTION [after Willis, 1868, fig. 13] 503.C ARCHES SUPPORTING PRIVY SEATS [after Willis, 1868, fig. 14] A longitudinal wall separated the lower part of the privy into two portions of unequal width. The southern part, 14 feet wide, was filled with earth and paved at the top. The northern part, 7 feet wide, formed a fosse bridged over by thin masonry arches, and carried wooden seats and seat partitions. there were wooden seats, boxed in by wall partitions at the rear and to the side, making the seats accessible from opposite sides in alternate sequence. Figure 504A-D shows the plan, sections, and exterior view of this structure and a detailed view of one of the original seats. The rere-dorters of the monks and lay brothers of Kirkstall Abbey, Yorkshire, as well as the Monks' privy of the Abbey of Maubuisson (Seine-et-Oise), had this same axial arrangement of seats (and there were unquestionably many others), but unlike the longhouse of New College, Oxford, these buildings were flushed by running water.33 33 For Kirkstall and Maubuisson see the literature quoted above in note 29. DISPOSAL OF WASTE BY WATER: AN URBAN, NOT A RURAL PRACTICE Disposing of human waste by using water power is an idea monks inherited from the Romans. It was an urban, not a rural, invention. In a purely agricultural society the nitrogenous content of this matter was far too valuable a substance for replenishing the soil to be discarded in a stream. The monks whose background was rural could not help being impressed by the skillful engineering that went into these water systems and lent to a primordial problem of nature a touch of inventive elegance. Now and then, in medieval sources, one runs into a passage that seems to 504.A OXFORD UNIVERSITY, NEW COLLEGE COLLEGE PRIVY BUILT BY BISHOP WYCKHAM BETWEEN 1380 AND 1386 PLAN OF THE UPPER FLOOR. DRAWINGS BY J. G. BUCKLER [504. A, B, C, D, E] LONDON, BRITISH MUSEUM COLLECTION OF DRAWINGS, ADD. MS. 36437. BY COURTESY OF THE TRUSTEES OF THE BRITISH MUSEUM reflect this concept, such as the remark in the Gesta Abbatum Lobbensium which lists the following among the accomplishments of Abbot Levinus (twelfth century): He built a new but more elegant room of sewers, joined to the dormitory, in the place of the old one (literally: from the old one); which room, below cleansed from filth by incessantly running water, he made more honorable above for the necessary use with seats furnished by suitable beauty.34 34 Gesta Abbatum Lobbensium chap. 23, ed. Arndt in Mon. Germ. Hist., Scriptores, XXI, 1869, 326-27: "Domum cloacarum dormitorio coniunctam de veteri novam opere elegantiori aedificavit, ut Quam acqua indeficienter pretercurrens inferius sordibus mundam rederet forma competens superius aptatis sedibus honestam usui necessario facerit." PHILOSOPHICAL IMPLICATIONS In other sources one finds undertones of a feeling that the currents of water so skillfully channeled through the monastic workshops cleansed the monastery in a deeper sense than the purely physical; the impressive, and in parts truly poetic, thirteenth-century description of the waterways of the monastery of Clairvaux, after a minute account of all the services that the water rendered to the various offices and workshops, terminates with: Lastly, in order that it may not omit any thanks due to it, nor leave the catalogue of its services in any way imperfect, it carries away all dirt and uncleanness and leaves all things clean behind it. Thus after having accomplished industriously the purpose for which it came, it returns with rapid current to the stream and renders to it in the name of Clairvaux thanks for all the services that it has performed, and replies to its salutation with worthy response.35 35 Migne, Patr. lat, CLXXXV, 1879, col. 571: "Postremo, ne quid ei desit ad ullam gratiam, et ne ipsius quaquaversum imperfecta sint opera, asportans immunditias, omnia post se munda relinquit. Et jam peracto strenue propter quod venerat, rapida celeritate festinat ad fluvium, ut vice Clarae-Vallis agens ei gratias pro universis beneficiis suis, salutationi ejus resalutatione condigna respondeat; statimque refundens ei aquas quas nobis transfuderat, sic de duobus efficit unum ut nullum appareat unionis vestigium; et quem dicessu suo teneum et pigrum fecerat mistus ei morantem praecipitat." For an equally interesting and even earlier description of the same water-ways, see I, 69. One of the puzzling aspects of the Plan of St. Gall is the fact that although its author is scrupulously precise in the specifications of the privies that answer the needs of the monks and their noble visitors, the question of privies is not even raised on the level of the serfs, the workmen, 504.B OXFORD, NEW COLLEGE. LONGITUDINAL SECTION A strikingly functional and no less sophisticated solution to the problem of monastic sanitation was applied in medieval university life (where students, while not cloistered, were in minor orders). The carpentry was superb; seats facing opposite sides in alternating sequence offered a maximum of privacy and comfort without violating the traditional monastic regulation that even while engaged in the most humble of human pursuits, none may enjoy the privilege of total seclusion. and the paupers. The absence of privies (or even the provision of space for such) is most strongly felt in the case of the Great Collective Workshop and the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers.36 36 See above, p. 190, fig. 430, and p. 144. This is not an oversight, in my opinion, but a case of social discrimination. From a certain level downward the designer of the scheme left the solution of the individual privy to the ingenuity of the builder. In the case of those structures housing both humans and animals this poses no problem, as the sanitation of the human occupants is subject to the same order of cleanliness that governs good animal husbandry and can be met with the greatest of ease by an infinite variety of ingenious improvisations. But in the case of the Great Collective Workshop and the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers, the absence of privies—or even of the provision of space for 504.C OXFORD, NEW COLLEGE. EXTERIOR VIEW FROM NEW COLLEGE LANE them—is more disquieting. The designer simply chose not to express himself on this issue. The Consuetudines Farfenses furnishes us with an interesting literary parallel for this discriminatory planning procedure. The same text that tells us with firm precision that the number of toilet seats in the House for Distinguished Guests should be equal to the number of visitors who can be bedded in this structure, wastes not a single word on the subject of privies of the large building—280 feet long and 25 feet wide—which contains on the ground floor the stables for the horses of the royal party and on the upper floor the eating and sleeping quarters of the lower ranking members of the emperor's train: Near the Southgate and [extending from there] to the Northgate, westward, let a house be built, 280 feet long and 25 feet wide. There establish the stables for the horses, divided into stalls; and above let there be a solarium where the servants eat and sleep; here tables should be installed, 80 feet long and 4 feet wide.37 37 Consuedutines Farfenses, ed. Bruno Albers in Cons. mon., I, 1900, 139: "A porta meridiana usque ad portam VIIItem trionalem contra occidentem sit constructa domus longitudinis CCtu LXXXta pedes, latitudinis XXti et V, et ibi constituantur stabule equorum per mansiunculas partitas, et desuper sit solarium, ubi famuli aedant atque dormiant, et mensas habeant ibi ordinatas longitudinis LXXXta pedes, latitudinis vero IIIIor." 504.E DETAIL 504.D OXFORD, NEW COLLEGE The roof belongs to the same period that produced the magnificent carpentry of the 14thcentury hall of Nurstead Court, Kent (fig. 346.A-D) and is similar to it. The roof of New College privy is carried by nine trusses, spaced at intervals slightly less than 10 feet. Their elegant, sharply cambered tie beams, chamfered underneath, are dovetailed into the wall plates. King posts rising from mid beam carry a center purlin surmounted crosswise by a collar piece bracing the rafters midway. Short vertical uprights steady the rafters at their springing. Outhouses with seating capacities comparable to that of the necessarium of New College are recorded in the most distant parts of medieval Europe, in both monastic and secular life. A monks' privy with two rows of seats (19 in all) backing each other along the center axis of the structure was built for the monastery of Batalha, Portugal, shortly after 1388 (for plans, see Lenoir, 1856, VII 6: 2, 366); in the northernmost fringes of the world, Old Norse sagas refer to royal "long houses" that could be used simultaneously by 22 men (for sources see Gudmundsson, 1899, 247). TRANSVERSE SECTION We close PART V with a charming and amusing verse, its presence in "a certain monastery, perhaps Tours" testifying another equally humble and traditional use of such structures.

END OF PART V 505. ST. GALL. VIEW OF THE CITY FROM THE WEST, IN 1545 HEINRICH VOGTHERR. WOOD ENGRAVING (29.6 × 42cm) The rendering shows the town and its surroundings from an imagined perspective in the air. Not yet separated, abbey and town are enclosed by a common masonry wall elaborated by towers, houses, and two main gates. A glimpse of the Bodensee (Lake Constance) orients the view to the northeast. Dominating the countryside are meadows cleared for bleaching linen, a local industry. The view is crowded with dwellings, farms and outbuildings, an inn, a fort, barracks and parade ground, an exercise and training yard. The main access road appears smooth and well paved approaching the city's crenellated gate; down the other, rougher road a carter gallops three span of horses hitched to a drey, laden perhaps with baled linen. A group of buildings amid trees (center, right) suggesting modest dwellings is situated outside the city walls. By mid-16th century, St. Gall clearly consisted of URBS and SUBURBS, a dichotomy that attested the arrival of modern times. The four largest meodows are bisected by the Irabach; its water-course, now underground, formed a natural boundary between town and monastery in the early Middle Ages. Two mills locate the cascade of the Steinach; its course deflects sharply westward, broken by the escarpment of the monastery site (cf. fig. 514, p. 331.) The abbey church lies slightly south of the east-west axis of this rise of land, its staggered roofs indicating various steps of construction. Similar views from different angles (figs. 507, 509.X) confirm the veracity of the rendering. Photo: Courtesy of Zentralbibliothek, Zürich, Department of Prints and Drawings.

      <field name="fulltext">VI THE PLAN OF ST. GALL &amp; ITS EFFECT ON LATHER MONASTIC PLANNING TRADITION AND CHANGE by CAROLYN MARINO MALONE and WALTER HORN INTRODUCTION THE sections that follow deal in a tentative form with the effect that the ideas embodied in the Plan of St. Gall had upon later monastic planning. An exhaustive treatment of such effects would require a separate book; nevertheless we will attempt to illuminate the question by concentrating on a selected group of later monasteries and by discussing only certain basic aspects of a far larger and more subtle complex of problems. Foremost in consideration are three questions that have always been of concern to the historian of monastic planning: 1. To what extent did Abbot Gozbert and his successors adhere to the Plan when they rebuilt the monastery of St. Gall from 830 onwards? 2. Did the concepts embodied in the Plan establish a tradition? 3. If this was the case, to what extent was this tradition modified by innovations deriving from new customs in the Cluniac, autonomous Benedictine, and Cistercian monasteries of the eleventh and twelfth centuries? FOR the treatment of the first of these three questions I am responsible. The examination of the two others, discussed in chapters 2 through 5, is based on a master's thesis written by Carolyn Malone and completed in time to allow its results to be included in this book. The research embodied in these chapters and its presentation are hers. I have made some minor additions, including all of the extended figure captions. We conclude with a brief Epilogue, and a review of excavations beneath Gozbert's church, based on a report by architect Dr. H. R. Sennhauer, in charge of excavations. W. H. 506.A ST. GALL SITE OF THE FORMER MONASTERY WITH ITS PRESENT BUILDINGS AIR VIEW FROM NORTHWEST LOOKING SOUTHEAST The Carolingian church and virtually all other monastic buildings were completely rebuilt between 1755 and 1767/68, but the street pattern and alignment of houses clustering around the church even today reflect, with amazing accuracy, the boundaries of the original monastery site. The Baroque church is co-axial with the three preceding medieval churches (see fig. 513.A-B) and almost identical with them in width and overall length. Double-apsed like the church of the Plan of St. Gall, it is, like the latter, without façade. By contrast its towers, flanking the apse at the eastern end of the building, do not guard the western entrances to the church, but rather signal to the outside world the location of the high altar and the relics of St. Gall. 506.B ST. GALL. SITE OF THE FORMER MONASTERY WITH ITS PRESENT BUILDINGS AIR VIEW FROM SOUTHEAST LOOKING NORTHWEST The primary reason for construction of the present church owed to the sack of the monastery in 1712 by the Protestant citizenry of Zürich and Bern. The reconstruction was undertaken with palatial magnificence, and a breathtaking aesthetic exuberance that derived its vitality from a new alliance of the landed aristocracy of Europe with Catholicism. In the wake of this accord spread one of the most lavish architectural styles of all ages. The designers of the new church endeavored to reconcile the directionalism of the traditional western church with a concept of centrality by arresting its longitudinal flow midway in the swirl of a domed rotunda, and by merging nave and aisles into a single undulating body of space. 507. MELCHIOR FRANK. 1596 DIE LOBLICH * STAT * SANT GALLEN * SAMBT * DEM FURSTLICHEN * CLOSTR ST. GALL, VIEW OF THE CITY FROM THE EAST. ETCHING ON IRON (40 × 61cm) [Courtesy of the St. Gall Historical Museum] The etching portrays with great precision the wedge-shaped boundaries of the elevated site (lower left quadrant) on which St. Gall founded his original cell. The site owed its distinctive shape to the courses of two converging streams, the Steinach, skirting the monastery to the south, and the Irabach, forming its northern boundary. The river escarpments not only sharply delineated the boundaries of the monastery site, but also afforded, at least initially, a good measure of natural protection. Even in Abbot Gozbert's day (816-836) the monastery appears to have been enclosed only by wattle fences. The earliest settlement of serfs and tenants grew up on the north side of the monastery where the ground was level. Its dependence on the abbey is permanently engraved into the architecture of the city by the semicircular course of its streets, that even today hug the contours of the monastery grounds. Search for urban freedom strained the relationship of abbey and city throughout the entire Middle Ages and reached a first climax in 1475 when the city purchased its independence from the abbey at a cost of 7000 guilders. During the Reformation (commencing in 1524), abbot and monks were forced into exile but were allowed to return when the power of the citizens was temporarily weakened by warfare with Kapel. Increasing conflicts culminated, in 1567, in the erection of a separation wall that segregated the territory of the city from that of the abbey, and thereby froze into permanency the confessional division brought about by the Reformation. Henceforward, city and abbey led their separate lives politically, culturally, and economically. In 1798 the abbey was divested of all its temporal possessions. Total supression came in 1805. In 1847 the church became the seat of a bishopric. Melchior Frank's etching is a so-called Planprospekt, a perspective from the air based on measurements taken on the ground. The plate is lost; the only known print is held in the Historiches Museum, St. Gall. VI. 1 REBUILDING OF THE MONASTERY OF ST. GALL BY ABBOT GOZBERT &amp; HIS SUCCESSORS FROM A.D. 830 ONWARD VI.I.I HARDEGGER'S CONTRIBUTION Up to the middle of the eighteenth century, the church which Abbot Gozbert built between 830 and 837 was still essentially intact, except for its transept and choir. From 1755 onwards, however, not only the church itself but most of the conventual buildings as well were torn down to make room for the magnificent and stately rococo buildings that form the pride of modern St. Gall (figs. 505 and 506). The street pattern and the alignment of the houses that cluster around the abbey retain with astonishing precision the shape of the original site, but of the Carolingian buildings that once rose on this precinct not a single stone appears to be left above ground level. A satisfactory answer to the question of whether, or to what extent, Abbot Gozbert and his successors adhered to the Plan of St. Gall as they rebuilt the monastery could only be found through a systematic program of excavations, for which at present there does not appear to exist a glimmer of hope.1 1 For a peremptory review of excavations undertaken in 1964 in connection with the installation of a new heating system in the 18thcentury church see Sennhauser, 1965. A full report by Sennhauser on these findings is pending. If we are nevertheless not entirely ignorant about Gozbert's work, this is due to the existence of a precious set of architectural drawings made early in the eighteenth century when much of the Carolingian work was still discernible. These late drawings have been brilliantly analyzed by August Hardegger, first in a dissertation published in 1917,2 2 Hardegger, 1917. and a few years later in a volume of the Baudenkmäler der Stadt St. Gallen, which Hardegger wrote in cooperation with architect Salomon Schlatter and Traugott Schiess.3 3 Hardegger, Schlatter-Schiess, 1922. It is to the imaginative, yet sober and cautious reasoning displayed in these studies, that we owe whatever tangible knowledge can be gleaned from the available sources about the design and layout of the monastery rebuilt by Abbot Gozbert and his successors. VI.1.2 THE CHURCH The dedicatory inscription of the Plan and the general historical context in which it was made leave no doubt that the Plan was drawn upon the request of Abbot Gozbert (816-836) of St. Gall for the purpose of giving him guidance in rebuilding his monastery.4 4 See I, 9. Gozbert began this project in 830 by demolishing the church which Abbot Otmar had built toward the middle of the preceding century.5 5 Otmar, a man of noble Alemannic birth, raised in the episcopal city of Chur in Raetia, became abbot of the monastery of St. Gall in 719 and died in exile on the island of Werd in the Rhine River in 759. For these and other bibliographical details and sources see Duft, 1959, 17. The most recent review of what is known about Otmar's Church is in Poeschel, 1961, 7-9. The work on the new church proceeded so rapidly that it could be dedicated in 837.6 6 For details see I, 10-11 and Poeschel, 1961, 29ff. Gozbert's church was gutted by fires in 937, 1314, and 1418 but the bulk of the walls, the clerestories of the nave and their supporting arcades apparently were not signally affected by these events.7 7 See Poeschel, 1961, 41ff; Hardegger, 1917, passim; idem in Hardegger-Schlatter-Schiess, 1922, passim. By contrast, the transept and the choir were completely rebuilt by the Abbots Eglolf and Ulrich VIII, from 1439-83.8 8 Hardegger, 1917, 45ff; Hardegger-Schlatter-Schiess, 1922, 90ff; Poeschel, 1961, 45ff. It is in the form it had then attained that the church is portrayed on the oldest bird's-eye views of the city: in a woodcut dated 1545 by Heinrich Vogtherr, in an etching on iron by Melchior Frank, dated 1596 (fig. 507), in an engraving of essentially the same view by Matthaeus Merian, published in 1638 (fig. 509X), as well as in several other drawings, the most important of which are a pen drawing of 1666 and a large drawing on parchment of 1671.9 9 For descriptions and reproductions of these drawings, see Poeschel, 1957, 38-39 and ibid., fig. 46 (Heinrich Vogtherr), figs. 53 and 54 Melchior Frank), fig. 56 (pen drawing of 1666) and fig. 57 (bird's-eye view on parchment of 1671). In 1712 the abbey was ransacked by the Protestants and the monks were expelled.10 10 On the Protestant upheaval of 1712, see Hardegger, 1917, 1ff; Hardegger-Schlatter-Schiess, 1922, 168ff; Poeschel, 1961, 65ff. When they returned a few years later it was painfully clear that extensive restorations would have to be undertaken. In anticipation of that event some detailed architectural surveys were made. In 1717 architect Johannes Caspar Glattburger surveyed the church and recorded its dimensions.11 11 Acta monasterii B 322, pp. 839 and 841 (cf. Poeschel, 1961, 30 note 5). Two years later Pater Gabriel Hecht made a scale-drawn plan of the entire monastery site, dated September 17, 1719 (fig. 510). In 1725-26 he added to this a set of no less than fourteen architectural drawings, in which he set forth how he thought the damaged church and other monastic buildings should be renovated.12 12 Before World War II, these drawings, bound into a fascicule, were in the Stiftsarchiv of St. Gall (cf. Hardegger-Schlatter-Schiess, 1922, 173 note 1). After their evacuation during the war, their whereabouts were no longer traceable (cf. Poeschel, 1961, 45, note 4). 508. ST. GALL. ABBEY AS IT APPEARED ABOUT 1642. BIRD'S-EYE VIEW FROM THE EAST DETAIL OF A MODEL OF THE CITY OF ST. GALL ST. GALL, HISTORISCHES MUSEUM [photo: Horn] Three of these drawings, reproduced in figures 511A-C, render the condition of the still surviving parts of the medieval church with great precision and show that what Hecht had in mind was not so much a reconstruction as a superficial modernization of the then existing work. Hecht proposed that the gothic choir be retained in its entirety. He added some baroque touches in surface treatment by superimposing a new columnar order upon the exterior elevation of the choir. In the interior he modernized the Gothic supports but otherwise retained the structure as he found it, leaving its Gothic vaults and windows wholly untouched. In the nave, likewise, he does not appear to have undertaken any radical changes. Hardegger is convinced that the arcades and the superincumbent clerestories of the nave which Hecht had before his eyes as he made his drawings were in essence still those of Abbot Gozbert's church (compare fig. 511A and B with fig. 512B and C). He feels that Hecht proposed to retain the intercolumniation of Gozbert's church and confined himself to simply increasing the heights in this part of the building. The only truly new feature in his proposal was the conversion of the two nave bays lying next to the choir into a pseudotransept surmounted by a dome, and the introduction on each of the two long sides of the church of a continuous system of chapels. For the rest he confined himself to superimposing upon the existing work a decorative relief of surface features, designed in the prevailing taste of the period. This included in the the interior the complete encasing of Gozbert's arcade columns in baroque shaped piers. Although Hecht's design proposals had no effect on the actual course of events, which took a radical turn a quarter of a century later, they are of incomparable historical value because they embody with amazing accuracy the record of what was then still left, or could then be discerned, of Gozbert's church. In analyzing this material, Hardegger came to the following conclusions concerning Gozbert's church and its relation to the Plan of St. Gall: 1. As stipulated in the explanatory legends of the Plan of St. Gall, Abbot Gozbert assigned to the nave of his church a width of 40 feet and to each of his aisles a width of 20 feet—dimensions which also are in conformity with the manner in which the Church is drawn on the Plan. 2. In full compliance with the intercolumnar titles of the Plan, but in deviation from the drawing (in which the 509. ST. GALL. ABBEY AS IT APPEARED ABOUT 1642. BIRD'S EYE VIEW FROM THE SOUTHEAST DETAIL OF A MODEL OF THE CITY OF ST. GALL ST. GALL HISTORISCHES MUSEUM [photo: Horn] columns are spaced at intervals of 20 feet) he assigns to the arcades an intercolumnar span of 12 feet. 3. In full compliance with the great axial title of the Church of the Plan, but again in deviation from the drawing (where the church is shown to have a length of more than 300 feet) he reduced the length of the church to 200 feet. He attained this goal by drastic changes in the design of the nave of the church, but retained the layout of transept and choir virtually in the form in which it was shown on the Plan. Hardegger's supporting evidence for these conclusions is presented below. CONCERNING THE WIDTH AND THE LENGTH OF GOZBERT'S CHURCH According to the scale-drawn plan made by Father Gabriel Hecht, in 1725-26 the nave of the medieval church had a length of 155 feet. Its clear inner width was 46 feet, that of the aisles 23 feet. The two clerestories rested on sixteen piers, each 3 feet square. They were placed at intervals of 17 feet (measured on center) and had between them a clear arcade span of 14 feet.13 13 Hardegger, 1917, 7 and 24ff; Hardegger-Schlatter-Scheiss, 1922, 68ff. Hardegger could establish that Gabriel Hecht, in measuring the medieval building as well as in laying out his own drawings availed himself of the so-called Württemberg foot14 14 On the Württemberg foot see Hardegger, 1917, 2; Hardegger-Schlatter-Schiess, 1922, 173. which had a unit value of 28.6 cm., and consequently was considerably smaller than the foot used in drafting the Plan of St. Gall. Hardegger thought that the architect who drew the Plan of St. Gall scaled his layout with a foot that formed an equivalent of 33.3 cm.15 15 Hardegger, 1917, 47; Poeschel, 1961, 31 accepts this interpretation of the scale of the Plan. Hardegger's assumption was confirmed by our own calculations (cf. I, 95-97). Converted to this scale, the measurements recorded by Gabriel Hecht would read as follows: length of nave: 133 feet; clear width of nave: 40 feet; clear width of aisles: 20 feet; clear span of the arcade openings: 12 feet. This in complete harmony with the dimensions stipulated in the explanatory titles of the Plan of St. Gall, with one difference only: the builders of Gozbert's church interpreted 509.X MATTHAEUS MERIAN. ABBEY AND CITY OF ST. GALL. BIRD'S-EYE VIEW FROM THE EAST ETCHING: 20.7 × 31.2cm. FIRST PUBLISHED IN 1638 &amp; BASED ON THE MELCHIOR FRANK ETCHING, FIG. 507 Merian's etching defines with great clarity the tripartite division of the post-medieval city; the abbey, the upper, and the lower town all separated from one another by high girdle walls. The city by now had grown to more than six times the ground area of the monastery in the shadow of which it had arisen. The wedge-shaped boundaries of the rise of land on which the monastery was built are distinctive. (For identification of the parts of the Church with its staggered roof levels, see caption to fig. 513.) Noteworthy among the medieval buildings east of the Church are: the circular chapel of St. Gallus (built 958-971) and north of it St. Peter's chapel, the oldest sanctuary on the grounds and dating from before the incumbency of Abbot Gozbert. East of it and in axial prolongation lies St. Catherine's chapel, where the monk Tutilo was buried in 912, and that served as chapel for the abbot's palace. (The latter, a tall building north of St. Catherine's, is not identical with the PALATIUM built by Grimoald, abbot from 841-872, and gutted by fire in 1418; it may have been located further west. 509.Y JOHANNES ZUBER, CADASTRAL PLAN OF THE CITY OF ST.

All of the smaller chapels to the east of the Church (St. Gall, Holy Sepulchre, St. Peter's, St. Catherine's) were demolished during a building campaign undertaken by Abbot Gallus II Alt in 1666-1671. He erected a long wing of domestic facilities east of the church (nos. 18-25) including a new dining room and audience hall for the abbot (no. 18) and a new chapel for St. Gall (no. 19), new lodgings for the porter (no. 20) and beyond the passage beneath the porter's lodging, servants' quarters, a bakery, and a pharmacy (nos. 21-25). The old but decaying abbot's palace remained at its original site (no. 48) but the site of St. Peter's and St. Catherine's was now occupied by a carriage house (no. 32). 511.A PATER GABRIEL HECHT. MEASURED PLAN OF THE ABBEY CHURCH OF ST. GALL, 1725-26, WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATION ORIGINAL FORMERLY ST. GALL STIFTSBIBLIOTHEK, Evacuated and lost during World War II [after Hardegger, 1917, plate facing p. 4] Gabriel Hecht retains the church of Otmar, the nave and aisles of Gozbert's church, as well as Eglolf's choir. He adds on either flank of the church two continuous rows of chapels, and converts the last two bays of the nave into a pseudo-transept surmounted by a tower. these dimensions as clear spans, whereas the designer of the Plan worked with a 40-foot square, the corners of which coincided with the center of every second arcade support. Being composed of nine arcades of spans of 12 feet on center, the nave of the Plan of St. Gall would have had a clear inner length of 108 feet. If one adds to this the thickness of the eight piers, each of which was 3 feet square, one arrives at a clear inner length of 132 feet, which corresponds within a margin of error of only 1 foot to the layout of the church measured by Gabriel Hecht. To place this figure into proper historical perspective, the reader must be reminded of the fact that Abbot Gozbert's church was two bays shorter than the church which Father Gabriel had before him. Before 1623 the two westernmost bays of the church were taken up by an open porch, surmounted by a chapel that was dedicated to St. Michael (fig. 513). This chapel was built after Gozbert's death as a connecting link between the main church and the church of St. Otmar. Consecrated in 867, it was taken down to make room for an enlargement of the monastery church by two additional bays when the chapel of St. Otmar was rebuilt, between 1623 and 1626.16 16 Hardegger, 1917, 26; Hardegger-Schlatter-Schiess, 1922, 132ff; Poeschel, 1961, 53ff. If one subtracts the length of these two added bays (34 Württemberg feet or 23 Carolingian feet) from the total length of the nave (155 Württemberg feet or 133 Carolingian feet) one arrives at an original length of 121 Württemberg feet or 105 Carolingian feet. This comes as close to the 108 feet of the nave of the Plan as one could expect, in absence of any more tangible archaeological information. It left 95 more feet of the total length of 200 511.B PATER GABRIEL HECHT. LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF ABBEY CHURCH OF ST. GALL, 1725-26, WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATION. FORMERLY ST. GALL STIFTSBIBLIOTHEK Evacuated and lost during World War II [after Hardegger, 1917, plate facing p. 5] feet to accommodate the transept, the presbytery and the apse.17 17 Hardegger's interpretation of the measurements furnished by Gabriel Hecht find confirmation in the measurements recorded by Johannes Caspar Glattburger, in 1917, as Erwin Poeschel has pointed out (Poeschel, 1961, 30ff). As already mentioned, they are, recorded in Acta monasterii, B. 322 p. 839 and 841. Glattburger, who like Gabriel Hecht used the Württemberg foot, listed the total length of the church as 272 feet. If one subtracts from this figure the 34 Württemberg feet of the two added westernmost bays of the church, one arrives at a total length of 238 Württemberg feet or the equivalent of 206 Carolingian feet, again close enough to justify the assumption that Gozbert complied with the explanatory title of the Plan that stipulated that the church should only be built to a length of 200 feet. CONCERNING THE LAYOUT OF THE TRANSEPT AND THE CHOIR OF GOZBERT'S CHURCH In examining the drawings of Gabriel Hecht, Hardegger observed that the dimensions of the choir built by the abbots Eglolf and Ulrich VIII between 1439 and 1483 corresponded almost precisely to the layout of the eastern portion of the Church of the Plan.18 18 Hardegger, 1917, 7; Hardegger-Schlatter-Schiess, 1922, 68. He felt convinced that the masonry of Eglolf's choir followed the lines of the Carolingian work (figure 512A-C). Eglolf apparently had simply merged the space of the crossing of Gozbert's church with that of its presbytery, converting them into the nave of a choir whose aisles extended to the eastern end of the church, but did not project laterally beyond the body of Gozbert's church. The new choir absorbed in its mass the subsidiary spaces which in the church of the Plan accommodated Scriptorium and Library. Hardegger's observations were keen and his argument is persuasive. One fails to understand why he had so little influence on the controversy generated by those who tried to resolve, in retrospect, what a Carolingian architect might have done had he redrawn the Church of the Plan in the light of the corrective measurements given in its explanatory titles.19 19 Discussed in I, 178-86. To leave choir and transept intact made sense in functional terms: it was here that the monks were stationed during their religious services for a total of four hours each day.20 20 See I, 180ff. To effect the required reduction of space by changing the dispositions of the nave also made sense, for here the loss of space was incurred not by the monks, but by the laymen, who attended only a fraction of 511.C PATER GABRIEL HECHT.

VI.1.3 THE CLOISTER It is clear that the cloister lay to the south of the church where it still is today (although completely rebuilt), and it is equally clear that the dormitory occupied the upper level of the eastern range which adjoined the southern transept arm precisely as on the Plan of St. Gall. This can be inferred from Ekkehart's account of the ignominous visit which Abbot Ruodman of Reichenau paid to the monastery of St. Gall under the cover of night and the description of the complicated route which he had to take in order to get from the cloister to the monks' privy.21 21 For a fuller discussion of this story and its architectural implications see I, 261-62.

A, B, C ARE SAME SCALE (CA.1:700) Bays 3-9 of the nave and aisles were built by Gozbert and are the oldest parts, dating from 830-837. Otmar's church, dedicated 24 September 867, located west of Gozbert's church was originally separated from it by an entrance hall surmounted by St. Michael's chapel which was dedicated 25 September 867 (cf. figs. 513.A-B, and figs. 507-509). The choir was entirely built by Eglolf, 1439-1483, on a ground area co-extensive with the transept and choir of Gozbert's church that had been damaged by fire in 1418. In 1623-26 St. Michael's chapel was demolished and Gozbert's church was enlarged westward by two bays, thus extending it all the way to Otmar's church. passage we also learn that the parlor (auditorium) was near the entrance of the church, as we would expect it to be in the light of the Plan of St. Gall. Ekkehart IV mentions a warming room (pyrale) in a context which suggests that in the tenth and early eleventh century it was used for disciplinary actions traditionally undertaken during chapter meetings.22 22 For more detail on this see below, p. 336. In the same chapter he also implies that the washhouse (lavatorium) was reached from the warming room; in fact the text seems to suggest that it was part of this room. In departure from the Plan of St. Gall, however, the Scriptorium was not on the north side of the church but next to the pyrale.23 23 Ekkeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, chap. 112; ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 379ff; ed. Helbling, 1958, 192-93. We know nothing about the location of the refectory or the cellar but there is no reason to presume that they were laid out in a manner other than that proposed on the Plan. The Carolingian refectory and dormitory perished in the great fire of 1418 and were completely rebuilt by Abbot Eglolf (1427-1442).24 24 Poeschel, 1961, 84ff.

The fire was set by a vindictive student in the attic of the schoolhouse and was carried by the north wind on to the roofs of the church and of the cloister. ST. GALL ABBEY CHURCH.

The four-storied building in the background (HELL) built by Abbot Ulrich Rösch, 1463-1491 (not shown on the plan), was probably a guesthouse. (Dates after Otmar refer to tenure of abbots.) 514. THE PLAN OF ST. GALL IMPOSED ON A CADASTRAL PLAN OF ST. GALL OF 1965 RED DRAWING, PLAN OF ST. GALL, SHOWN 1/8 ORIGINAL SIZE (1:1536) IMPOSED ON CADASTRAL PLAN AT SAME SCALE Even a cursory glance at the shape of the site to which the monastery was confined discloses that it could not have been an easy task to attempt literally to superimpose the rectangular scheme of the Plan of St. Gall upon so irregular a plot. The superimposition emphazises the ideal character of the Plan and foreshadows adjustments that, in ensuing centuries, were to be made in many other places where the topography of a particular site prevented complete realization of the ideal monastery of the Plan. In order to be built on this particular site, as foreseen on the Plan, the Great Collective Workshop, the Granary, the houses for fowl and their keepers, the Gardener's House, most of the Monks' Vegetable Garden, and even a corner of the cemetery, would have had to lie across the gorge of the Steinach, that at its lowest point lay some 50 feet lower than the monastery ground level. (cf. caption, figure 505, and similar superimpositions made by Hardegger, 1922, 22, fig. 3; and Edelmann, 1962, 289.) This drawing also shows that the ground area of the Baroque church of St. Gall is congruent not only with that of the church as originally conceived on the Plan but also with the surface area the entire aggregate the medieval churches had attained after Otmar's church had been added to Gozbert's church (cf. fig. 513). On the Plan of St. Gall the Abbot's House is located east of the Outer School in axial prolongation of the northern transept arm of the Church. The palace (palatium), built by Abbot Grimoald (841-847) with the aid of masons from the imperial court (palatini magistri) was also to the north of the church although further eastward. A deed of 1414 reveals that it was furnished with a solarium; as is stipulated on the Plan of St. Gall. Like most of the other buildings it was gutted by the fire of 1418 and subsequently completely reroofed as well as rebuilt internally by Abbot Henry IV and his successor Eglolf (1427-43).26 26 Poeschel, 1961, 90ff. On the Ichnographia drawn by Gabriel Hecht in 1719, (fig. 510), and in the bird's-eye view of the city of St. Gall issued by Melchior Frank in 1595 (fig. 507), as well as on the anonymous city view of 1666,27 27 Ibid., 61, fig. 11. this rebuilt variant of the Carolingian palace is truthfully portrayed. The original cemetery of the monks was east of the monastery church between the chapel of St. Peter's and the Steinach River28 28 On the original site of the monk's cemetery see Hardegger-Schlatter-Schiess, 1922, 265ff and Poeschel, 1961, 78ff. on precisely the same location in which it was shown on the Plan of St. Gall; and St. Peter's itself29 29 For the chapel of St. Peter's see Poeschel, 1961, 76. (perhaps in conjunction with St. Catherine's chapel) lay on the site that on the Plan is occupied by a double chapel that served as oratories for the novices and the sick. It consisted, as can be inferred from the city view of Melchior Frank (fig. 507) and several other drawings, of three contiguous building masses of varying width and height arranged along the same axis. Here our knowledge of the position of the offices of the Carolingian monastery ends. Whatever evidence survives of their original disposition is hidden in the ground. The city and the canton of St. Gall, not to speak of the Confederation of Switzerland, whose support would be needed in a project of this magnitude, have not faced as yet the challenge of clarifying this important historical problem through a program (long overdue) of systematic excavations. In the meantime it must be underscored that in those cases for which historical evidence is available, the layout of Gozbert's monastery appears to have conformed with the scheme of the Plan. This condition may even have applied to most of the unknown sectors of the site, except for the Hen and Goose Houses in the southeastern corner of the Plan. Their location is in conflict with the relief of the actual plateau on which the abbey rose. Here the steep embankment of the Steinach River, that swings sharply toward the north, would have called for adjustments that might also have affected some of the neighboring buildings. A glance at the city view of Melchior Frank (fig. 507) and the photographs of the monastery site, forming part of the magnificent model reconstruction of the city of St. Gall, made in 1919-22 by architect Salomon Schlatter (figs. 508 and 509) reveals this condition with great clarity. In figure 514 we have superimposed the course of the river and other boundaries of the monastery site upon the scheme of the Plan. The axis of the church is given by its still-existing crypt. The superimposition shows that between the church and the Steinach there is sufficient room for all of the buildings that on the Plan are located to the south of the Church. The houses for the animals and their keepers to the west of the Church, could easily have been accommodated in the great area that now is occupied by the St. Gallus Platz.30 30 See Hardegger-Schlatter-Schiess, 1922, 21. The original entrance to the monastery was in the west, as it is on the Plan of St. Gall, through the Gallustor (later: Grüner Turm).31 31 Ibid., 22. The only truly distinctive difference between the scheme of the Plan and the actual monastery was that Gozbert's church did not terminate with an apse in the west—understandably so because in St. Gall, St. Peter, to whom this apse is dedicated on the Plan, had already a sanctuary of his own.32 32 Ibid. In the Abbey of St. Gall, instead, this area was occupied by a chapel dedicated to St. Otmar and connected with the church by an open porch that was surmounted by an oratory dedicated to St. Michael (fig. 513). St. Otmar's chapel was built by Abbot Grimald and consecrated on September 24, 867 by Bishop Salomon.33 33 On St. Otmar's chapel, see Hardegger-Schlatter-Schiess, 1922, 75ff and Poeschel, 1961, 35ff. It rose on the space that was released on the actual building site by the reduction of the church as originally drawn on the Plan from 300 to 200 feet. The only point in which Hardegger failed was that in his reconstruction drawings of Gozbert's church (fig. 512A) he did not remain faithful to his own argument but allowed the two transept arms to project beyond the masonry of the Gothic choir (obviously in the desire to make them more fully conform with the Plan). H. R. Sennhauser informs me that this was not borne out by excavations conducted under the pavement of the present church, which showed that the circumference walls of the Gothic choir rose indeed, as Hardegger had postulated, on the foundations of the corresponding Carolingian work (see below, pp. 358-59).

VI. 2 THE MONASTERY OF CLUNY, BUILT BY ABBOT ODILO, 994-1048 VI.2.1 ITS DESCRIPTION IN THE SO-CALLED CUSTOMS OF FARFA Our first complete description of the layout of a Benedictine monastery later than the Plan of St. Gall is found in a chapter of the so-called Customs of Farfa (Consuetudines Farfenses) written between 1030 and 1048.1 1 Consuetudines Farfenses, book II, chap. 1, ed. Albers in Cons. Mon, 1, 1900, 137-39. These customs were believed to pertain to the monastery of Farfa near Rome, until Dom Ursmer Berlière and Dom Hildephonsus Schuster showed that they were the customs of Cluny recording the layout of the monastery built by Abbot Odilo of Cluny (994-1048).2 2 Berlière, 1900, 164-65; Schuster, 1907, 374-85; cf. Graham, 1929, 4; and Conant, 1968, 42-43. The chapter of the Farfa text with which we are here concerned falls into two parts: a description of the layout of the claustral range of buildings, and a description of the layout of buildings located peripherally around this complex.3 3 Julius von Schlosser, who believed that the writer of the description had before him an ideal drawing like that of the Plan of St. Gall, observed that for the first part of the description the measurements and definitions are given in the indicative mood, whereas, beginning with the description of the Infirmary the mood changes to the hortative subjunctive. He inferred from this that the buildings referred to in the indicative were already built when the text was written about 1043, while those referred to in the subjunctive had as yet not been constructed. Schlosser, 1889, 42 and 46. Since it forms the basis for conclusions set forth on the pages that follow, we feel compelled to quote it verbatim: LUTTRELL PSALTER The Psalter, dating ca. 1340, appears to have only these three owls (border ornament, fol. 177v) among its illustrations.

END OF PARALLEL TEXT TREATMENT (After Albers, Cons. Mon, I, 1937-39) I. The length of the church is 140 feet, the height 43 feet, with 160 glass windows. The chapter house is 45 feet long, 34 feet wide with four windows on the east, three on the north. On the west are twelve arches with two columns affixed to each. The inner parlor is 30 feet long. The camera, 90 feet long. The dormitory is 160 feet long, 34 feet wide. All the windows are glass, 97 in total, as tall as a man extending his arm, and 2½ feet wide. The walls are 23 feet high. The latrine is 70 feet long, 23 feet wide. In that building there have been arranged 45 seats with a small window above each seat, 2 feet high, ½ foot wide. Above those seats is built a wooden structure and above this wooden construction, there are 17 windows, 3 feet high, 1½ feet wide. The warming room is 25 feet wide, and the same in length. From the door of the church to the door of the warming room there are 75 feet. The refectory is 90 feet long, 25 feet wide. The height of the walls is 23 feet; there are glass windows, eight on each side, 5 feet high and 3 feet wide. The monks' kitchen is 30 feet long, 25 feet wide. The lay kitchen has the same dimensions. The cellar is 70 feet long, 60 feet wide. The almonry is 10 feet wide, 60 feet long, the same width as the cellar. The narthex is 65 feet long with two towers placed in front of it. Underneath is an atrium where the laity stand so as not to impede the processions. From the south entrance to the north, there are 280 feet. The length of the sacristy is 58 feet with the tower, which is at its head. The chapel of St. Mary is 45 feet long and 20 feet wide; its walls are 23 feet high. The first cell of the sick is 27 feet wide and 23 feet long with eight beds and as many seats outside in the portico of that cell, and the cloister of that cell is 12 feet wide. The second cell is the same in all respects. Also the third and the fourth. Let a fifth be smaller, where the sick might come to wash their feet on the sabbath, or those brothers who have been burnt to change [their bandages]. A sixth cell should be prepared where the servants attending them can wash the pans and all the utensils. Near the narthex must be built a house for distinguished guests 135 feet long, 30 feet wide, to receive all the visitors who, along with their squires, shall come to the monastery. On one side of that house have been prepared forty beds and as many straw matresses for the repose of as many men, and forty latrines. On the other side have been arranged thirty beds where countesses or other noble women can rest, with thirty latrines where alone they can see to their needs. In the center of that lodging there should be placed tables like those of the refectory, where both the men and the women can eat. During the great holidays that house should be decorated with curtains and drapes and bench coverings. In front of that house let there be another, 45 feet long, 30 feet wide. Its length should reach clear to the sacristy, and in it should sit all the cobblers and tailors, who sew what the chamberlain tells them. They should have there a table 30 feet long, and another table joined to it. Both tables should be 7 feet wide. Between that house and the sacristy and the church and also the narthex there should be a cemetery for the burial of the lay. From the south gate to the north gate let there be built on the west a house 280 feet long, 25 feet wide for the separate stalls of the horses, and above that a solarium where the servants can eat and sleep. They should have tables 80 feet long, 4 feet wide, and when they cannot feed some of the visitors at the above-mentioned building, they should feed them at this one. At the head of that building let there be a place where those can come together who arrive without squires and there receive from the alms brother sufficient charity in the form of food and drink. Outside of the refectory of the brothers 60 feet from its head twelve latrines should be dug and as many baths, where at fixed times the brothers can bathe. After that location let the cell of the novices be built and it should be divided off into four parts: in the first they might meditate; in the second, ear; in the third, sleep; and the fourth have a latrine on the side. Next to that one let there be built another cell where the goldsmiths or jewelers or glaziers come for their craft. Between the latrines and the cells of the novices and of the goldsmiths they should have a house 125 feet long, 25 feet wide and its length should extend to the bakery. Its length including the tower at its head is 70 feet, its width, 20 feet. 515. CLUNY. PLAN OF MONASTERY ABOUT 1050 REDRAWN FROM CONANT, VARIOUS VERSIONS Cluny sprang from a nucleus of five or six monasteries united by its first abbot, Berno (909-927). Under the leadership of Abbot Odo (927-942) and his successors, and vigorously supported by the Papal See, Cluny became the center of an order that included, by about 1150, no fewer than 314 monasteries all over Europe as well as the Holy Land. The fabric of Cluny was almost utterly destroyed during the French Revolution. Through intimate knowledge of the topography and archaeology of the site, superior draftsmanship, and an ingenious synthesis of historical sources, Kenneth John Conant has reconstructed the various stages of the architecture of this great center of monastic reform, thus making a major contribution to its visual history. The church of this plan, Cluny II, was built by Abbot Mayeul around 954-981, perhaps over the court of the original villa given to its monks in 910. The adjoining conventual buildings were erected ca. 991-1048 by Abbot Odilo, replacing Mayeul's claustrum. Conant believes that Odilo rebuilt the east and west ranges of the cloister outside Mayeul's buildings, thus taking them out of alignment with the transept and façade of Mayeul's church, thereby forming the peculiar L-shaped bend of the northern cloister walk where it clears the transept. Insertion of a chapter house in the east range, together with the small size of both Odilo's cloister yard and Mayeul's church caused extension of the east range beyond the limits of the cloister square—a feature that in the 12th century became widespread among independent Benedictine churches of England (figs. 516, 518); and standard among 12th-century Cistercian houses (figs. 519-521). Attempts to convert the prose account of the monastery described in the Consuetudines Farfenses into a graphic reconstruction were made by Julius von Schlosser in 1889, by Georg Hager in 1901, and by A. W. Clapham in 1934.4 4 Schlosser, 41-66, Fig. 1; Hager, 1901, col. 167-86, fig. 1; Clapham, 1930, 166-78. The views set forth by these scholars have been expanded and refined by Kenneth John Conant in a series of studies published over a period of nearly thirty years.5 5 Conant, 1939, 1949; 1954, 1963; 1965, and 1968. Schlosser felt that the Latin text was confused, ambiguous, and disconnected, and consequently assumed that the description of the buildings around the cloister followed no logical order. He had overlooked the dimensional clues in the text which could help to clarify the order.6 6 Schlosser, 1889, 49-60. Hager made use of these clues and, by grouping buildings of identical widths together, discovered that the author of the text describes the monastery in a continuous order away from the church and clockwise around the compound of the cloister, describing first the east range, then the south range, and finally the west range. Hager noted that the resulting order coincided with the layout of later monasteries, in particular that of the Abbey of St. Peter and Paul of Hirsau, which he used as a model for his reconstruction.7 7 Hager, 1901, 171-83. Conant focused upon the task of superimposing the order of buildings recorded in the Farfa text upon the actual building site of the monastery of Cluny, and in doing so, demonstrated that the Farfa text was compatible with the topography of Cluny. Conant published his findings in a number of plans; the latest in 1965 (fig. 515) and 1968. In developing these schemes he depended upon a plan of the monastery of Cluny drawn up between 1700 and 1710 (now in the Musée Ochier), and to some extent on the results of his excavations conducted from 1928 onwards with the permission of the French authorities under the auspices of the Medieval Academy of America. The Farfa description discloses that the monastery built toward the middle of the eleventh century by Odilo of Cluny was, in its basic features, still like the layout of the buildings shown on the Plan of St. Gall. There are of course some modifications—most notably the introduction of a separate chapter house at the head of the east range—but these changes remain within the framework set forth on the Plan of St. Gall. VI.2.2 LAYOUT OF THE CLAUSTRAL BUILDINGS As on the Plan of St. Gall, the cloister at Cluny lies to the south of the church. The east range contains the dormitory and its annexes; the south range, the refectory and the kitchens; the west range, the cellar and the parlor.8 8 On the parlor, see below, pp. 345-46. EAST RANGE In Cluny, as on the Plan, the monks' dormitory (dormitorium) occupies the second floor of the east range. The Farfa text describes it as 160 feet long and 34 feet wide, with walls reaching to a height of 23 feet. But in the space below the dormitory some important innovations have been made. On the Plan of St. Gall, this entire space is occupied by the Monks' Warming Room coextensive with the dormitory of 40 feet by 85 feet overhead. In Cluny, this space is internally divided into a chapter house (45 feet long and 34 feet wide); an auditorium (30 feet long); and a camera (90 feet long). The Monks' Warming Room (calefactorium) has been reduced at Cluny to a surface area of only 25 feet by 25 feet and shifted into the south range. This amounts to complete reassignment of the space beneath the dormitory, a modification for which an explanation will later be offered.9 9 See below, p. 348 and captions, figs. 342, 344, 346, 350, and 356. Chapter house In the monastery shown on the Plan of St. Gall the chapter meetings were held in the northern cloister walk, which was made wider (15 feet) than the other three walks (12½ feet) and furnished with benches.10 10 See I, 248-49. The same arrangement, as has been shown above, prevailed at Fontanella, which might indicate that the cloister walk next to the church was the common location for the capitulum in Carolingian times.11 11 See I, loc. cit. Attempts made by Hager and others to show that a separate chapter house existed at Jumièges in the seventh century, at Reichenau in 780, at Fontanella by 823-833, and in the monastery of St. Gall after 830, can be shown to be based on faulty textual exegesis, and in one case on the use of a corrupted text.12 12 For an analysis of these texts see Carolyn Malone, 1968, chap. II, 27-38. To use the northern cloister walk for chapter meetings, however, had disadvantages. Although warmed by the rays of the sun in the winter, when the arc of sun is in the southern hemisphere, and sheltered from the north wind by the church, the open cloister walk offered little protection from inclement weather. The physical discomforts endured in the winter or on rainy days must have called early for a more protected location for the chapter meetings. Certain passages in the Casus Sancti Galli of Ekkehart IV (980-1060) suggest that in the abbey of St. Gall chapter meetings were then held in the Monks' Warming Room. It is quite possible that the special room for chapter meetings at Cluny II owes its existence at the head of the east range to the desire to convert into a separate space a portion of the former warming room that in the earlier days had served temporarily for chapter meetings during inclement weather. Ekkehart mentions that on the order of the abbot, a raging monk was punished during a chapter meeting by being "bound to a column of the warming room and harshly beaten," (ad columpnam piralis ligatus acerrime virgis caeditur).13 13 Eckeharti (IV.) Casus sancti Galli, chap. 141; ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 440-42; ed. Helbling, 1952, 232-34. Another passage indicates that the pyrale was the traditional place for punishment in the monastery, since it was there that the whip was kept.14 14 Ibid., chap. 36: Ratperte autem mi, rapto flagello fratrum quod pendet in pyrali, de foris, accurre! ed. Meyer von Knonau, 1877, 133-37; ed. Helbling, 1952, 77-80. Punishment was traditionally carried out in the chapter house in the Middle Ages. This practice seems already to have been current in the time of Ekkehart IV, since a text from Paderborn of 1023 explicitly states that punishment was administered in the chapter house.15 15 Lehman-Brockhaus, I, 1938, 210, no. 1044, Vita Meinwerci episc. Patherbrunnemsis: "Illico canonicis in capitolium principalis ecclesie convocatis capellanum imperatoris huius rei conscium durissime verberibus castigari iussit." Inner parlor Its name (auditorium) in the Farfa description suggests that it served as an area where monks might talk to one another when silence was being observed in the rest of the cloister.16 16 More on this below, p. 345. Supply room The largest architectural entity in the east range after the dormitory is a space 90 feet long and 34 feet wide which in the Farfa text is designated as camera, that is, "store-" or "supply room".17 17 Du Cange, sub verbo indicates that camera refers to some kind of store room, usually a place where money or valuable are kept. On the Plan of St. Gall, it is consistently used in the sense of "store" or "supply room." It is too far away from the kitchen to be interpreted as a pantry or larder. Since the Farfa description lacks any reference to a vestiary in which the clothes of the monks are kept, it is possible that this room was a storehouse for clothing and such other material necessities that were furnished by the camerarius (chamberlain) who was in charge of the workmen and craftsmen. On the Plan of St. Gall, the monks' clothing was kept, and perhaps even tailored, in the large vestiary which formed a second story over the refectory (40 feet by 100 feet). Since the generous clothing allowance provided by the synod of Aachen in 816 was adopted by Cluny, the storeroom for clothing would need to be about the same size as that of the Vestiary on the Plan of St. Gall.18 18 See I, 281ff. See Mahn, 1945, 25. One of the primary changes necessitated by the inclusion of the chapter house and inner parlor in the east range was that these additions made this range along with its annexes (the monks' bath and privy) extend southward well beyond the cloister square. In other respects, the relative position of the dormitory, privy, and bathhouse are identical with those on the Plan of St. Gall. SOUTH RANGE In both the Plan of St. Gall and Cluny II the refectory formed the principal mass of the south range, although at Cluny the refectory was apparently a building of one storey. It is 90 feet long, 25 feet wide, and 23 feet high. At Cluny as on the Plan, the monks' kitchen (coquina regularis) lies at the western end of the refectory in the corner between refectory and cellar; but at Cluny there is also a kitchen for laymen (coquina laicorum) not found on the Plan of St. Gall. The dimensions of the two kitchens of Cluny are the same, 25 feet by 30 feet. Since the Farfa description of the house for noblemen and of the hospice for paupers does not include any reference to kitchens, the coquina laicorum may represent a consolidation of the formerly autonomous kitchens of these two houses.19 19 On the Plan of St. Gall both guest houses had not only their own kitchens, but also their own bake and brew houses. See above, pp. 151153 and p. 165. The dimensions of the calefactory at Cluny indicate that it was part of the south range. It has the same width as the refectory, 25 feet, distinctly narrower than the buildings of the dormitory range, which are 34 feet wide. The sequence of the account suggests that the calefactory was at the eastern end of the south range. This is a solution different from that of the Plan of St. Gall, but at the same time, the position of the calefactory at Cluny next to the east range might suggest a development from its earlier position under the dormitory in the east range on the Plan of St. Gall.20 20 A pantry shown in Conant's plan between the refectory and the kitchen in the south range seems to be based only on the dimensions of the south range in the 1700-1710 plan. It is not indicated in the Farfa text or Bernard's Ordo Cluniacensis, nor as far as I know, in any other text. WEST RANGE At Cluny II, as on the Plan of St. Gall, the cellar (cellarium) forms the principal building of the west range. It is 70 feet long and 60 feet wide. Next to it lies a long and narrow room which the Farfa text designates "aelemosynarum." This room is 10 feet wide and 60 feet long; its name suggests that it served as an area in which the almoner administered to the needs of transient paupers. An inscription on the Plan of St. Gall indicates that a room of similar shape and nearly the same dimensions (15 feet by 47½ feet) performed the triple function of serving as "an exit and entrance to the cloister," as a Parlor "where the monks could converse with guests" and as "the place where the feet [of the visiting pilgrims] were washed" (exitus &amp; introitus ante claustr? ad colloquendum cum hospitibus &amp; ad mandat? faci- end?).21 21 See I, 307ff. A passage in chapter 46 of book II of the Customs of Farfa reveals that it was in connection with the ritual of the mandatum that the visiting paupers received their customary ration of wine and bread (justitiam vini et libram panis);22 22 Consuetudines Farfenses, Book II, chap. 46, ed. Albers, Cons. mon., I, 1900, 179. and in a complete description of this ritual found in the first book of these customs, explains that the place where the paupers' feet are washed, is "in the cloister to the side of the church" (in claustro juxta eccles- iam)23 23 Ibid., Book I, chap. 54; ed. Albers, Cons. mon., I, 1900, 49; in locum quo constitutum est, videlicet in claustro juxta ecclesiam deducat pauperes ad sedendum. which indicates that the eleemosynarium at Cluny was located in the same relative position as the Parlor on the Plan of St. Gall, and also served some of the same functions.24 24 On the Monks' Parlor on the Plan of St. Gall and its multiple functions see I, 307-310. A parlor or auditorium is not mentioned in the Farfa text, but appears in the two passages of the Ordo Cluniacensis, written around 1086. In one of these the claustral prior is admonished to "go through the whole cloister beginning at the door of the auditorium, carefully checking that the eleemosynarium is closed and locked" (Claustrum incipiens ad ostium auditorii, sollicite observans quatenus Eleemosynaria sit clausa et obserata).25 25 Ordo Cluniacensis, per Bernardum, pars I, caput II, ed. Herrgott, 1726, 141-43. In the other, the door of the eleemosynarium is mentioned next to "that other door through which those who come from outside enter the cloister" (ad ostium . . . Elemosynariae, et ad illud, per quod de foris venientium est ingressus in claustrum.26 26 Ibid., 142. Both passages suggest that auditorium and eleemosynarium were two different areas. Architecturally this could have been accomplished in two ways: either by relegating the function of the parlor to a separate space, or by dividing the oblong eleemosynarium internally into two areas accessible by separate doors, one used as parlor, or auditorium, for the reception of guests, the other for the washing of the feet and the distribution of alms. In the former case one would have to assume a separate room immediately to the north of the eleemosynarium, perhaps in the court around the galilee where Conant indicates a room for the Porter. VI.2.3 LAYOUT OF THE EXTRA-CLAUSTRAL BUILDINGS As on the Plan, the infirmary lies east of the church, the houses for the guests to the west and northwest, and the houses of the workmen to the south of the cloister. AREA EAST OF THE CONVENTUAL BUILDINGS In Cluny, as on the Plan of St. Gall, this tract contains the monk's cemetery as well as the monks' infirmary. The infirmary itself consists of four rooms, each 27 feet wide and 23 feet long plus two additional rooms a little smaller than the others. In one of these the sick brothers came to wash their feet on Saturdays; in the other, attending servants cleaned the pans and all the other utensils of the sick brothers. The Farfa text does not refer to an infirmary chapel; however, a chapel 45 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 23 feet high (oratorium sanctae Mariae) which could have served this function is mentioned immediately before the infirmary in the text. There is no further evidence to either confirm or disprove this assumption. In departure from the layout shown in the eastern tract of the Plan of St. Gall, the novitiate has been separated from the infirmary and moved to a site south of the east range. As on the Plan, however, the novitiate may still have been arranged peripherally around a cloister yard, as Conant suggests in his latest plan. The Farfa text describes it as composed of four parts: "In the first they meditate; in the second they eat; in the third they sleep; in the fourth there is a latrine on the side" (prima ut meditent, in secunda reficiant, in tertia dormiant, in quarta latrina ex latere). AREA SOUTH OF THE CONVENTUAL COMPLEX Again, there are striking similarities between the Plan of St. Gall and Cluny II. The bakery (pistrinum) lies to the south of the monks' kitchen. The dimensions, including the bulk of a tower that stands at the head of the bakery, are listed as 20 feet by 70 feet. As on the Plan, the work and living quarters for the workmen and craftsmen are arranged along the southern edge of the monastery to the north of the bakery. They are accommodated in a building (domus) 125 feet long and 25 feet wide.27 27 The Farfa text refers to this house simply as domus. It does not state explicitly that this is the house for the workmen. The function of a house of these dimensions and at this location, however, could not be interpreted in any other manner. The goldsmiths, jewelers or glaziers (aurifices, vel inclusores, seu vitrei magistri) had their own cell, the dimensions of which are not listed in the Farfa text. The principal house for workmen does not include facilities for tailors and shoemakers. Their workshops are located north of the cloister. This arrangement differs distinctly from that on the Plan of St. Gall. AREA NORTH OF THE CLOISTER The workshop for tailors and shoemakers (sartores atque sutores) occupied a building 45 feet long and 30 feet wide which extended clear to the sacristy on the north side of the church. The sacristy is 58 feet long and has at its head a tower (turris). Alfred Clapham proposed that the sacristy and the house for the tailors and shoemakers might have been installed in the masonry of the church of Cluny I, the western half being converted into the workshop, the eastern half into the sacristy.28 28 Clapham, 1930, 167, 174. —a hypothesis that Conant finds plausible.29 29 Conant, 1965, 182. On the Plan of St. Gall this was the site for the Abbot's House. A house for the abbot is not mentioned at any place in the Farfa description. The absence of a house for the abbot seems due to a change in the rules concerning the abbot's sleeping accommodations. The Customs of Udalric, written about 1085, specifically state that the bed of the abbot was located in the middle of the monks' dormitory and that it was the abbot who gave the signal to get up in the morning: In medio dormitorii est lectus eius prope murum; sonitum ipse facit quo fratres diluculo ad surgendum excitantur.30 30 Consuetudines Cluniacenses collectore Udalrico, Book III, chap. 2, "De domno abbate," cf. Migne, Patr. Lat. CXLIX, 1882, cols. 733-34. Since the Farfa text fails to mention an abbot's house, this practice must already have been in effect during the abbacy of Odilo (995-1049). The beginnings of this development can be observed in the tenth century monasteries of Moyen Moutier and Leittlich. In each of these monasteries the abbot's house was attached to the monks' cloister. To eliminate the abbot's house entirely, thus to draw him bodily into the community of sleeping monks, was the ultimate step. It was the enforcement of a policy proposed as early as 816 at the synod of Aachen, but revoked at the synod of 817.31 31 See the discussion of the legislative conflicts concerning the abbot's right to live and eat in his own house; see I, 323-24. AREA WEST OF THE CONVENTUAL COMPLEX The Farfa text is quite explicit concerning the location and use of the buildings which lie to the west of the church and near the gate of the monastery. Again, the analogies with the Plan of St. Gall are striking. Both on the Plan and at Cluny this is the location of the houses in which the monastery's visitors are received. On the Plan of St. Gall these consisted of a House for Distinguished Guests, a House for the Vassals and Knights who travel in the Emperor's Following, a House for Visiting Servants, and the Hospice for Pilgrims and Paupers.32 32 See above, pp. 144-53, 155-56, 165-67. The monastery of Cluny, according to the Farfa text, provides for a house with bedding and eating space for forty noblemen and thirty noblewomen, a house for the horses of the visiting noblemen, and a house for pilgrims and paupers. The relative location of these facilities, in both instances, appears to be the same. The house for the forty noblemen and the thirty noblewomen at Cluny has been discussed in detail in a preceding chapter.33 33 See above, p. 275, and p. 277, fig. 477. It belongs to the same building tradition as the House for Horses and Oxen on the Plan of St. Gall, and its two privies, which accommodated seventy toilet seats, forty for men and thirty for women, reflect the highest standard of medieval sanitation.34 34 See above, pp. 301-305. The house for the horses and servants who travel in the following of the distinguished guests extends from the north gate to the south gate. It is 25 feet wide and has an impressive length of 280 feet. The ground floor accommodates the horses of the traveling guests and for that purpose is divided into stalls (per mansiunculas partitas). Above the stable there is a sunroom (solarium) where the servants eat and sleep. This room is furnished with at least two ranges of tables 80 feet long and 4 feet wide.35 35 Conant assigned this solarium to the monastery's lay brothers. This is not implied in the Farfa text and is incompatible with the studies of Kassius Hallinger, which indicate that the Cluniacs did not adopt the lay brothers institution before the last decade of the eleventh century (Hallinger, 1956, 14ff). The Farfa text only states that "servants" and "excess guests that could not receive their meals in the house for the visiting noblemen" (famuli . . . et quotquot ex adventantibus non possunt reficere ad illam mansionem) should sleep and eat in the solarium above the stable. The term famuli could refer to both the servants of the visiting noblemen or visiting servants from the monastery's outlying estates. It is likely, however, that those of the guests were intended. The servants of the noble guests would then be lodged near the horses of their company, as the travelers on the Plan of St. Gall were with theirs, and the house for the nobles' retinue would be located near to their guest house, as on the Plan. Each noble guest must have had at least two servants, so housing for at least 140 servants would have been necessary. This was probably the function of the room above the stables, since it provides a large area and since the Farfa text specifies that it housed the guests whom the palatium would not accommodate, as well as the famuli, Furthermore, no other housing is provided for the retainers of the noble guests. The dimensions of the house for pilgrims and paupers are not listed in the Farfa text. The building is simply referred to as "the place where those can come together who ride without squires and there receive from the almsbrother sufficient charity in the form of food and drink" (locus . . . ubi conveniant omnes illi homines, qui absque equitibus deveniunt, et caritatem ex cibo atque potum . . . ibi recepiant ab elemosynario fratre). The text tells us that it lies at the head of the house for horses and servants, but does not reveal whether this means to the south or north of it. Conant placed it as the northern end of the stables. The relative location of these facilities for guests, consequently, appears to be like that on the Plan of St. Gall. The Farfa text says nothing about any houses for livestock and their keepers but the topography allows for a forecourt of considerable dimensions precisely at the place where one should expect them in the light of the Plan of St. Gall. IRREGULAR SHAPE OF ODILO'S CLOISTER YARD The original concept of the Plan of St. Gall was that the Church should be 80 feet wide and 300 feet long, but an explanatory title inscribed in the longitudinal axis of the Church directs that in actual construction it should be reduced to 200 feet.36 36 See I, pp. 77ff. The church of Cluny II, built by Abbot Mayeul between 965 and 981, was only 140 feet long (Ecclesia longitudinis CXL pedes).37 37 See above, pp. 333ff. Conant believes that the timbered houses in which Abbot Mayeul lodged the monks of Cluny lay further inward than Odilo's conventual buildings, and that when Odilo constructed the new masonry ranges he located them outside and around the original structures.38 38 Conant, 1965, 182. If this assumption is correct, the old cloister yard of Cluny would have been considerably smaller than the cloister yard of the Plan of St. Gall (only about 75 feet square, as compared to the 100 by 102½ feet of the Plan or the 100 by 100 feet stipulated by Hildemar as the acceptable minimum).39 39 See I, 246. Should the original dormitory of the monks indeed have been located inside of Odilo's masonry ranges, the original dormitory of Cluny would have been in axial prolongation of the transept of Mayeul's church, i.e., in the same relative position in which it is shown on the Plan of St. Gall. Moving his claustral ranges further out, Odilo would have brought the cloister yard of Cluny back to the dimensional standards set by the Plan of St. Gall but at the same time would have created an irregularly shaped cloister yard, in which the east range was separated from the transept. This solution had no lasting effect on later monastic planning.40 40 See below, p. 343. It may very well have been the outcome of special local conditions, namely the inordinate smallness of Mayeul's church and original cloister which could only be overcome by disconnecting dormitory and transept.41 41 Conant's arrangement also depends on the 1700-1710 plan of Cluny (now in the Musée Ochier). If the west range of Cluny II remained in the position in which Conant shows it, and the east range were aligned with the transept, the cloister yard would still be in line with the standard set on the Plan of St. Gall. Nevertheless, if the east range is placed to the east of the transept, it does account for a passage in the Farfa text which states that the chapter house, which was located at the northernmost end of the dormitory range, had "four windows on the east and three on the north" (ad oriente fenestrae IIIIor; contra septemtrionem tres). In order to accommodate three windows, the north wall of the dormitory range would have to have been a free-standing wall and could not have butted directly against the southern transept wall of the church. Clapham in his reconstruction of Cluny, however, placed a passage way between the transept and chapter house and thus provided for the windows in the text. Clapham, 1930, 167, 173. VI.2.4 CONCLUSIONS Schlosser's and Hager's analyses of the Farfa text, Clapham's attempt to apply it to the monastery of Cluny, and Conant's reconciliation of this text with the actual topography of the monastery of Cluny, make it clear that the monastery constructed by Abbot Odilo of Cluny (995-1049) was, in its principal dispositions, a reflection of the scheme displayed on the Plan of St. Gall. There are certain modifications, some of which can be traced to a change in custom. But the fundamentals remain unaltered. The historical weight of this observation becomes apparent only if one realizes that the layout of the monastery shown on the Plan of St. Gall was by no means the only Carolingian or early medieval arrangement available for imitation. The cloister of Jumièges (Gemeticum), founded by Philibert around 650, had dormitory, refectory, and cellar installed in one two-storey building 50 feet wide and with an unheard-of length of 290 feet. Refectory and cellar shared its ground floor; the dormitory extended the entire length of the upper storey.42 42 Vita S. Filiberti Abbatis Gemeticensis, Chap. 7; ed. Mabillon, Acta Sanctorum Ordinis S. Benedict, Tome II, 820. For a schematic reconstruction of Jumièges see note 43. The triangular cloister yard of Angilbert's monastery at St. Riquier (Centula), built 790-799 (figs. 196-197) shows that the square was by no means the only form available for the layout of a Carolingian cloister yard. In the monastery of Fulda, built by Ratger between 817 and 822, in the cathedral of Cologne, built by Bishop Hildebold between 800 and 819, and even in the master monastery of Inden, built from 815 onwards by Louis the Pious for Benedict of Aniane, the monks' cloister was to the west, not to the south of the church. In the case of Cologne, the cloister was not even square, but of trapezoid form.43 43 For Fulda, Cologne, and Inden see I, 187, and 221; and I, 192; see figures 138, 139, and 147, respectively. For a reconstruction of Merovingian Jumièges based on a new interpretation of this text, see Horn, "Two Early Medieval Monasteries," 1973, 63, fig. 8, and idem, "On the Origins of the Medieval Cloister," Gesta, 1973, 35, fig. 35. Yet another arrangement different from that set forth on the Plan of St. Gall was the layout of the monastery of St. Wandrille (Fontanella). Here the conventual buildings built by abbots Gervold (787-806) and Ansegis (823-833) lay to the north of the church. The refectory and the cellar were in the east range, the dormitory in the west, and the domus in the north (fig. 520A).44 44 This is based on Schlosser's interpretation of the Latin text which is more convincing than Hager's less literal translation of the text. Hager places the refectory and cellar on the west, the dormitory on the east, and the major domus opposite the church. Both reconstructed cloisters are different from the arrangement on the Plan of St. Gall. (Schlosser, 1889, 30; Hager, 1901, col. 143. For an examination of the Latin description found in the Gesta abbatum Fontanellensium see Malone, 1968, 19, 20, 30; Horn, 1973, 46, and above, pp. 278-79, figs. 478A-B. The analysis of Cluny II as described in the Farfa text discloses, however, that it was the arrangements seen on the Plan of St. Gall which became the guiding pattern for later monastic plans. This may be due to the fact that the arrangement of the monastic offices which appears on the Plan of St. Gall was more practical than any of the other arrangements. The location of the cloister to the south of the church, the warmest side in the winter, was especially desirable in northern countries. The dormitory and the warming room of the monks were conveniently located in the east range, near their choir in the church where they spent at least four hours each day, beginning with a service held at two o'clock in the morning. The refectory and the kitchen with their activities were isolated in the south range, the area farthest from the church. The cellar was placed in the west range, facing the outer court from which it took provisions. The location of the medical services and of the novitiate to the secluded eastern tract of the monastery, the houses for the workmen to the south with easy access to water, the livestock and their keepers in the large courtyard to the west, the houses for the guests near the gate of the monastery—all of this made perfect sense in terms of monastic planning. The affiliation of the Plan of St. Gall with the reform of Benedict of Aniane, however, may have been the most important reason for the survival of this layout in later monastic planning.45 45 See I, 20-25. The prime objective of this movement—viz., to establish binding rules regulating even the smallest details of monastic life—was never forgotten, especially since the resolutions made during the two great reform synods of Aachen had been promulgated by Louis the Pious as public laws.46 46 See I, 21. The capitularies of the emperor contained a clause instructing the attending bishops and abbots to make these new ordinances known to their monks, and Louis the Pious appointed inspectors to see that all monasteries observed these customs. The monastery of Inden was to serve as a training ground for monks whose task it became to go out and insure compliance throughout the empire with the unity of customs established at Aachen.47 47 See I, pp. 20-24, and specifically Semmler's illuminating article, "Die Beschlüsse dea Aachenes Konzils im Jahre 816" (Semmler, 1963). The transmission of the missionary ideals of the synods to the monastery of Cluny can be traced through a series of monastic foundations in direct lineage from Benedict of Aniane to Cluny. Benedict himself, under the direction of Louis the Pious, sent twenty monks to the newly founded Abbey of St.-Savin in Poitou.48 48 Vita S. Benedicti Anianesis, chaps. 45 and 58; cf. Migne, Patr. Lat., CIII, 1864, cols 375 and 383. St.-Savin escaped the ravages by the Normans in the second half of the ninth century and maintained the regularity of its monastic life. Around 870 the monks of St.-Savin restored the ancient abbey of St.-Martin-les-Autun, and with it, reasons Watkin Williams, "would have arrived the spirit of the Concordia regularis and the observances prescribed at the councils of Aachen."49 49 Williams, 1938, 93. Consequently, from St.-Savin to St.-Martin-les-Autun, and from there to Baume-les-Messieurs, the parentage of Cluny can be traced to Benedict of Aniane. Dom Bruno Albers has further established, on the basis of textual similarities, that the Ordo Qualiter of Benedict of Aniane and the Capitula of 817 were passed to Baume-les-Messieurs and then to Cluny.50 50 Albers, 1905. Berlière, 1906, 262, 266, summarizes his method and results. This was the traditional heritage professed by Cluniac monks. According to John, the biographer and friend of Odo, second abbot of Cluny, "Euticius instituted those customs which have hitherto been observed in our monasteries" (Benedict of Aniane's baptismal name was Witiza, or Euticius in Latin).51 51 Herrgott, 1726, 14. Graham, 1929, 2, summarizes Herrgott's discoveries. It is self-evident that such an important issue as the layout and order of the buildings in which the monks and their serfs were housed would have been part of this overriding preoccupation with uniformity of custom. The layout of the monastery of Cluny, as described in the Farfa text, discloses that in the middle of the eleventh century the arrangements set forth on the Plan of St. Gall were indeed alive. But in precisely what manner this tradition was bequeathed to Cluny may never be ascertained. We are unfortunately completely ignorant of the layout of the cloisters in the chain of abbeys which leads from Benedict of Aniane to Berno of Cluny. The seventeenth-century engravings of St.-Savin and St.-Martin-les-Autun cannot be trusted to give reliable information on the early medieval layout, since both of these monasteries were extensively rebuilt in the later Middle Ages.52 52 Germain, [ed.] Monasticon Gallicanum, V. 1 pl. 22, xxv. VI. 3 LAYOUT OF THE BENEDICTINE MONASTERY FROM THE LATE ELEVENTH TO THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY VI.3.1 ENGLISH SOURCES All of the monasteries discussed on the pages which follow are English, because in England the archaeological record is more reliable and richer than elsewhere in Europe. The suppression of monastic life by Henry VIII from 1538 onward halted rebuilding; and the existing or excavated remains reflect the original dispositions more closely than do the Continental monasteries, most of which were extensively renovated from the fifteenth century onward and remained in continuous use up to the French Revolution. No claim for completeness is made. The observations set forth are based on a survey of the remains of not more than twenty-one Cluniac and autonomous Benedictine monasteries of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. The Clunaic abbeys are Lewes, Castle Acre, Thetford, and Much Wenlock; the autonomous abbeys: Battle, Bardney, Christchurch, Canterbury, Gloucester, St. Albans, Ely, St. Augustine's Canterbury, Westminster, Rochester, Durham, Bury St. Edmunds, Peterborough, Norwich, Winchester, Reading, Worcester, and Finchale.1 1 On Lewes see Hope, 1886; on Castle Acre, Hope, 1895, and Raby and Reynolds, 1936, reprinted 1952; on Thetford, Raby and Reynolds, 1946, reprinted 1964; on Much Wenlock, Granage, 1922, and Graham, 1939, reprinted 1965; on Battle, Brakspear, 1937; on Bardney, Brakspear, 1922; on Christchurch, Canterbury, Willis, 1868; on Gloucester, Hope, 1897; on St. Albans, Peers and Page, 1908; on Ely, St. Augustine's Canterbury, Westminster, Rochester, Durham, Bury St. Edmunds, Peterborough, Norwich, Winchester, Reading, Worcester and Finchale, Atkinson, 1933. This sampling, admittedly, is small when viewed against the total of Benedictine monasteries flourishing at this time. Yet their comparison conveys a surprisingly uniform picture. They disclose that the layout adopted at Cluny was transmitted to the English houses and became traditional. * * * * * * * * * * 516. LINCOLNSHIRE, ENGLAND. BARDNEY ABBEY. GROUND-LEVEL PLAN Founded towards the close of the 7th century, wrecked by the Danes in the 9th, re-established in 1087 after the Conquest, Bardney Abbey from 1115 onward and with aid of royal grants, was completely rebuilt as an independent house under the immediate protection of the Crown, by Walter of Ghent, son of the Conqueror's friend and nephew, Gilbert of Ghent. Following a standard pattern, building began with construction of the choir and the southern flank of the church, to allow the cloister to be set against it. The cloister was enclosed in the course of the 12th century in this sequence: chapterhouse, refectory, dorter and privy—the two latter structures over undercrofts which, together with their superstructure, projected far beyond the cloister square—a feature parallel with developmental changes that occurred at about the same time in the layout of Cistercian monasteries (see pp. 349ff). Refectory and cellar (like their counterparts on the Plan of St. Gall) took up the entire length of the south and west ranges; but the cellar (in contrast to the Plan of St. Gall) accommodated on its second storey the abbot's lodging. An aisled guest house and an aisled infirmary were added in the 13th century, the former to the south and the latter to the east of the cloister square. [redrawn from Harold Brakspear, 1922, frontispiece] VI.3.2 TRADITION Many autonomous Benedictine monasteries adopted the customs of Cluny. Christchurch, Canterbury, for instance, was built by Lanfranc, who was previously prior of the Abbey of Bec in Normandy. The customs of Bec are true to the earlier customs of Cluny which William of Volpiano brought to Fécamp and other northern monasteries at the beginning of the eleventh century. The monastic constitutions which Lanfranc later wrote are similar to the customs composed under Odilo between 1030 and 1048.2 2 Knowles, 1951, xiii. There was continual interaction between Cluny and the autonomous English houses and in many cases Cluny must have transmitted the reform ideas promulgated at Aachen. Earlier ties, however, also connect the English monasteries with the synods of Aachen. The monastic revival begun by Dunstan in the second half of the tenth century was based on the continental monastic tradition of Benedict of Aniane.3 3 Knowles, 1950, 38-42. While in exile Dunstan took refuge in the monastery of Blandium at Ghent in 954. Around 970 a synod under Dunstan's guidance was called at Winchester to establish a common way of life for English monasteries under the patronage of King Edgar. The procedure and provisions of the meeting consciously imitated those of the synod at Aachen, directed by Benedict of Aniane in 817 under the auspices of Louis the Pious. In the presence of monks from Fleury and Ghent the Regularis Concordia, a code based on the Ordo Qualiter and the Rule for Canons and Capitula of Aachen, was drawn up.4 4 Ibid., 43. The Concordia shows influence from Cluniac and Lotharingian uses as well as the Ordo Qualiter which had been common to all Western Europe since the ninth century. Semmler, 1960, 343-45, has shown by collating and classifying medieval codices that the manuscript texts of the two synods of Aachen were well known throughout Europe from the ninth through fifteenth centuries. Three of these texts, dating from the turn of the tenth to the eleventh century, were found in English monasteries. One of them was probably written in Winchester, another in Abbington. Still another, dating between 1040 and 1070, was written in a cloister in Canterbury, perhaps even in the monastery of Christchurch. About forty monasteries were founded under this revival between 957 and the Conquest, but no architectural remains seem to indicate the arrangement of the conventual buildings before the last phase of this revival during the reign of Edward the Confessor. At this time both the style of Norman architecture (exemplified by Westminster Abbey, consecrated in 1065) as well as the typical institutions of Norman monasticism, that clearly characterize post-Conquest England, were already established.5 5 Knowles, 1950, 58; Robinson, 1910, 81-100; Clapham, 1934, 20. In the Post-Conquest English Benedictine monasteries of the eleventh and twelfth century, the east range of the cloister contains the dormitory; the south range, the refectory; and the west range, the cellar, as on the Plan of St. Gall and at Cluny II. These relationships have become traditional and binding. Whenever the site permitted in the few examples that remain the peripheral houses and workshops were arranged as they were on the Plan of St. Gall. The entrance to the monastery is usually to the west of church and cloister. The mill and bake house are adjacent to the kitchen, as on the plan of the waterworks of Christchurch, Canterbury (Kent), shown above in figure 52. The infirmary, its chapel and cemetery are to the east of the cloister, as can be seen at Christchurch and at Bardney Abbey, Lincolnshire, (fig. 516). In some particulars the English plans reflect the arrangement on the Plan of St. Gall even more closely than Cluny II. In all of these monasteries the east range of the cloister is aligned with the southern transept-arm and the cloister forms a regular square. Whenever the location of the twelfth century kitchen is known, as on the Canterbury plan (fig. 52), it is isolated from the refectory and connected with the south range by passageways, as it was on the Plan of St. Gall; while at Cluny II it may have been part of that range. As at St. Gall, there is only one kitchen; Cluny had two. Other aspects seem closer to the Plan of St. Gall, but they are not well enough established to allow generalization. In some English monasteries such as Thetford (fig. 517), part of the undercroft of the dormitory may still have served as the warming room, but it is considerably reduced in area and pushed to the southern part of the range. There is some indication that in later English monasteries night stairs connected the dormitory with the southern transept arm of the church, as it did on the Plan of St. Gall. In Cluny (fig. 515) such a connection probably would not have existed if the east range, as Conant assumes, was severed from the transept. In Cistercian planning the night stairs reappear in the place where they were indicated on the Plan of St. Gall. Since the elements that Cistercian planning have in common with the Plan of St. Gall could only have been transmitted by later Benedictine monasteries, they must have been more common in Benedictine planning than present remains indicate.6 6 Atkinson, 1933, 58 n. 8, mentions spiral staircases at Westminster, St. Albans and Durham, which may have served as night stairs. The Cistercian examples he cites are Netley, Beaulieu, Tintern, Fountains, Kirkstall and Melrose. Our survey of English monastery plans also reveals that the dimensions of the cloister square comply with the standards set by the Plan of St. Gall and with the stipulation made by Hildemar of Corbie (ca. 845) that a cloister yard should never be less than 100 feet square.7 7 See I, 246. In the Benedictine and Cluniac English monasteries the cloister yard, as a rule, is not smaller than this, though it is sometimes larger.8 8 This is also true for the Cistercian monasteries. 517. NORFOLK, ENGLAND. THETFORD PRIORY (1103-1104). PLAN [after Raby and Reynolds, 1946] The priory was founded by Cluniac monks from Lewes. Its conventual buildings, constructed clockwise around the cloister yard between the years 1107 and 1140, consisted in the east of chapter house, day stairs to the dormitory, a passage for access to the infirmary grounds, and a building of two stories, accommodating over an undercroft (that later was partitioned into parlor and warming room), the monks' dormitory and privy, the two latter (as in Bardney) reaching considerably beyond the south range. South and west range accommodate in the traditional manner the refectory, kitchen, cellar, and outer parlor. These basic similarities between the English monasteries and the Plan of St. Gall remain constant wherever the natural conditions of the site permit. When exceptions occur they can be explained either by the topography or by restrictions imposed by the architectural surroundings.9 9 Some of the typical reasons for an irregular cloister arrangement are exemplified by the following: according to Atkinson, 1933, 3, Durham Priory was built on the steep bank of a river, and consequently, could not have a western entrance to the monastery; the dormitory is over the west range for drainage purposes. Knowles, 1952, 13, says the cloister at Gloucester lay to the north of the church because the town cemetery was to the south. Since the river contracted the space to the northeast, the dormitory was placed at right angles to the east walk. The irregular position of the monastic buildings at Monte Cassino, seen in both Schlosser's and Willard's reconstruction, was undoubtedly necessitated by its location on a venerated, but narrow and steep hill. See Schlosser, 1889, 67 and Willard, 1935, 145. Later fortress-abbeys like Mont-Saint-Michel freely change the traditional arrangement for defensive advantages. See Gout, II 1910, 388-496. In England such irregularities are more common in Benedictine than in Cistercian monasteries because the Benedictines rarely had a virgin site on which to build and were often settled near cities, while the Cistercians chose isolated areas, a fact which may be primarily responsible for what, in contrast to Cistercian conformism, appears to be a lack of uniformity in Benedictine planning. VI.3.3 INNOVATIONS CHAPTER HOUSE Certain innovations made at Cluny became an integral part of the later Benedictine tradition and remained in permanent departure from the solution set forth on the Plan of St. Gall. The most notable of these is the inclusion in the east range of a separate chapter house.10 10 See above, p. 336. Once conceived, the separate chapter house could not be abandoned because of its functional advantages. To place the chapter house at the northern end of the east range, however, brought with it certain complications. As long as it remained confined to the ground floor, the dormitory overhead could still be connected directly with the transept by means of night stairs. But if the space of the chapter house extended upwards through the entire height of the east range, arrangements had to be made to connect the dormitory with the church by special passageways; or the night stairs had to be abandoned altogether.11 11 Willis, 1868, 17, 18, points out that the sloping structure between the transept and the chapter house seen on the Plan of Christchurch, Canterbury is such an arrangement. "At Gloucester and Reading there was, it is said, no direct communication, the brethren having to go out into the cloister." (Hope, 1897, Records of Gloucester Cath. III, 106.) INNER PARLOR A second permanent innovation adopted by the Benedictine monasteries was the inclusion of an inner parlor in the east range, directly adjacent to the chapter house. Although this inner parlor is referred to by name in several Benedictine and Cluniac customs, its function is not stated.12 12 Salmon, 1947, 33, has found that its use in never defined, and, consequently, concludes that its use cannot be stated. An auditorium is first mentioned in the Farfa description of 1043.13 13 Consuetudines Farfenses, ed. Albers, I, 1900, 137. Later in the eleventh century it is mentioned in the tours of the claustral prior at Cluny and Hirsau. Bernard's account of the claustral prior's tour at Cluny in his Ordo Cluniacensis refers to a parlatorium in the same context that the otherwise similar tour in the Consuetudines of Hirsau refers to the auditorium.14 14 Ordo Cluniacensis, per Bernardum, Pars, I, Caput III, "De Priore Claustrali," ed. Herrgott, 1726, 143. Constitutiones Hirsaugienses seu Gengenbacenses, Book II, chap. 20 "De Claustrali priore, et ejus adjutore," 1066, in Migne, Patr. lat., CL, 1880, col. 1066. This designates the inner parlor in the east range as a place for talking and listening. Twelfth-century customs outside the Benedictine order further explain the exact use of the auditorium. Cistercian customs describe the auditorium as the place where monastic officials could converse privately with one or two monks, where the prior made work assignments, and handed out tools for the day's work after the chapter meeting, and where the master of the novices could instruct new novices.15 15 Guignard, 1878, 174, 177, 233, 106, cites the pertinent chapters, 72, 75, 113, 15, of the Consuetudines. The Liber Ordinis S. Victoris Parisiensis further specifies that in this order of canons the auditorium or locutorium, as it is called in this text, was particularly used for briefly talking about any business that could neither be signified (probably referring to sign language) nor put off until the time of the locutio, but the Liber emphasizes that no one could talk there without permission from a high member of the order.16 16 The pertinent passages are cited under locutorium in Du Cange, "libro Ordinis S. Victoris Parisiensis MS. cap. 19: Quod si aliquid eis specialiter dicendum fuerit, quod nec illic significari possit, nec usque ad tempus Locutionis differri, poterit Armarius usque in Locutorium regulare educere eos et illic breviter quod dicendum est, intimare. Adde cap. 27. Ibidem pag. 34: In Locutorium nullus eat, nisi vocatus ab Abbate vel Priore. Et cap. 38: Nullus extraneus vel Canonicus in Locutorium regulare ad loquendum ducatur. Fratres qui licentiam loquendi ad invicem quaerunt, in nullo loco nisi in regulari Locutorio loqui possunt. In caeteris Locutoriis nullus vocet aliquem de claustralibus, nisi solummodo Abbas et Prior." I have not been able to trace a published text of this manuscript. Various copies, dating from the twelfth and thirteenth centuries are in the Bibliothèque Ste.-Geneviève, Bibliothèque Nationale, Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in Paris (see Bonnard, n.d., xxviii.). It explicitly states that no stranger may be led into this "regular locutorium" and also mentions rules for the "other locutorium," thus distinguishing between the locutorium or auditorium in the east range and the auditorium in the west range, which, as on the Plan of St. Gall, served as reception room for visitors. The auditorium in the east range of the twelfth-century cloister is thus defined as a place where claustral silence could be broken to discuss necessary business. This had probably been its role since its beginning. 518. NORFOLK, ENGLAND. CASTLE ACRE PRIORY (CA. 1090). PLAN [after MINISTRY OF PUBLIC WORKS, ANCIENT MONUMENTS AND HISTORICAL BUILDINGS (Raby and Reynolds), 1952] The church of the priory was finished by 1110, some 20 years after it was founded. The cloister, built around 1150, consisted in the east of an apsed chapter house, day stairs to the upper level of a two-storied building, the undercroft of which supported the dormitory floor by a central row of columns. This entire range, like the corresponding ranges at Bardney and Thetford (figs. 516-517), projected far beyond the south range and terminated in the monks' latrine. The south range contained a small warming room, refectory, and kitchen. The west range consisted of a building of two stories accommodating cellar and parlor below, and the prior's lodging and other rooms above. Although silence was at all times considered a basic monastic virtue it had not always been as severely enforced as it was by the Cluniacs, the later autonomous Benedictines, and the Cistercians. St. Benedict, in dealing with this problem, referred to it as taciturnitas rather than silentium.17 17 Benedicti regula, chaps. 6, 42, 49, ed. Hanslik, 1960, 38-39, 104-6, 119-21; McCann, 1952, 34-37, 100-1, 114-15; Steidle, 1952, 121-23, 240-41, 251-54. He designated three regular periods of absolute silence; but for the rest of the time only excessive loquacity was forbidden. The same relative freedom of speech, except at certain regulated periods, is evident in the monastic customs of the eighth and ninth centuries. The rule of ordinary silence is in fact so relaxed that a consuetudinary from Corbie of around 826 permits conversation during the midday rest in the summer, provided that it does not bother those who sit and read in bed; should there be any need for sustained talk the monks must simply go outside and conduct their business there. In the same text they are instructed not to yell from a distance because of the noise.18 18 Consuetudines Corbeienses, ed. Semmler, Corp. cons. mon. I, 1963, 417 and translation by Charles W. Jones, III, 123. Under relaxed conditions like these there was no need for a special room in which the ordinary claustral silence could be broken. No such area, consequently, is set aside on the Plan of St. Gall. Joseph Semmler has pointed out that it was not until the tenth century that the monks began to practice strict silence during the days of the great religious festivals. This trend toward increased enforcement of silence is true of the reformed German monasteries, the English monasteries that adopted the reform of Dunstan, and it is also true in particular for Cluny.19 19 Semmler, 1960, 337. In the eleventh century men like Peter Damian (9881072), inspired by the same ideals of reform as Cluny, wrote impassioned letters against unnecessary talking and forcefully recommended greater silence.20 20 Salmon, 1947, 35. At Cluny, as the number and length of the breaks in silence were progressively reduced, as absolute silence was required even in the workshops, a sign language was developed to maintain the necessary communication.21 21 Ibid. The auditorium in the east range, first mentioned in the Farfa description, provided an area for talking aloud and may well owe its existence to the pressure of increasing claustral silence. Like the sign language it might also have originated at Cluny. Just as the sign language was adopted by nearly all the later medieval monasteries, the auditorium in the east range became an integral part of all later Benedictine and Cistercian planning.22 22 Ibid. Perpetual and absolute silence is stressed in documents cited from many autonomous Benedictine abbeys. Consequently, the auditorium was as much a necessity in these abbeys as at Cluny. It is only because the sign language seems to have originated at Cluny that I suggest that this might also be the source for the auditorium. Salmon mentions that the sign language spread from Cluny and was adopted by nearly all the monasteries of the Middle Ages; so may have been the case with the auditorium. NOVITIATE Another innovation made at Cluny that seems to have been permanently adopted in later monastic planning was the transfer of the novitiate to a location more closely related to the quarters of the regular monks. The Constitutions of Lanfranc reflect a growing tendency to integrate the novices with the regular monks in the eleventh century English Benedictine monasteries: "The novice shall sleep in the cell of the novices, or, if the monastery have no such special cell, in the dormitory.23 23 Knowles, 1951, 106, edits the Latin text: "In cella nouitiorum dormiat, aut in dormitorio, si cenobium huiusmodi cellam non habet." "He shall be taken into the church and a place assigned to him. From the church he shall be taken to the dormitory and the place shown him where he is to rest, and he shall be taken beyond the dormitory, and the cells shown him to which he is to repair when nature's ways demand it . . . on that day the novice shall follow, and a seat in the refectory shall be assigned."24 24 Ibid., 135. "Postea ad ecclesiam ducatur et locus assignetur quo tunc statio sua firmetur. . . . De ecclesia in dormitorium ducetur, ei locus quo pausare debeat ostendatur, et etiam ad loca ulteriora ducetur, et celle ostendentur, ad quas secretis nature exigentibus diuertere debeat. . . . Die illa sequatur nouitius, in refectorio sedes sibi assignetur." These passages by Lanfranc suggest that in the late eleventh and twelfth century there was not always a separate building for the novices and that they often shared the buildings of the regular monks. In the English plans there is no indication of a special court of building set aside for novices. The novices were probably often integrated with the monks for economic reasons and perhaps also because there were not as many oblati in the eleventh and twelfth centuries as there were in the ninth century. According to David Knowles, despite Lanfranc's attempts to perpetuate the age-old institution of child oblation, it was everywhere on the decline fifty years after his death.25 25 Ibid., xix. ABBOT'S HOUSE As at Cluny, so in the autonomous English Benedictine houses: a change in customs was responsible for the disappearance of a separate house for the abbot. But this issue remained controversial, as it had been in the days of St. Benedict of Aniane.26 26 See I, 22. Like the Customs of Udalric, the Constitutions of Lanfranc27 27 See above, p. 343. reveal that the abbot slept in the dormitory: "In the early morning no one shall dare to make a sound as long as (the abbot) is in bed asleep."28 28 Knowles, 1951, 73, edits the Latin text. The Constitutions of Lanfranc were of course influenced by the customs of Cluny, and consequently may not be typical of the majority of autonomous English Benedictine monasteries. "Quamdiu dormierit in lecto suo mane nullus sonitum audeat facere." Yet by 1150 all but a very few abbots in England had removed to quarters of their own.29 29 Knowles, 1951, 73. Brakspear, in his survey of English abbots' houses, discloses that by the thirteenth century the abbot, as on the Plan of St. Gall, is once more provided with a separate building, usually connected to the outer parlor with guest houses next to it. This is the case at Battle and Castle Acre (fig. 518).30 30 Brakspear, 1933, 140-42. WARMING ROOM Other changes made at Cluny, like the moving of the warming room from the east range to the south range, may have also occurred in some English Cluniac and autonomous Benedictine houses, but in other cases the warming room may have remained in the east range as on the Plan of St. Gall, although it was reduced in size. In the Cluniac priory of Thetford, indications of a fireplace suggest that the warming room may have been located in the southern half of the east range.31 31 Raby and Reynolds, 1946, 9. Much rebuilding, however, took place in this area in the fifteenth century. Hope, 1886, 93, interpreted a thickening in the east wall of the east range of the Priory of St. Pancras at Lewes as indicating a fireplace and consequently the warming room. Cranage, 1922, 118, mentions remains of a fireplace in the southeast, corner of the east range which dates from the twelfth century at Much Wenlock. But in many other Benedictine monasteries an area in the east range is designated as the warming room solely by analogy with a passage in the Rites of Durham of 1593 indicating that the warming room was located in the east range at that time.32 32 Fowler, 1903, 88. Although the sixteenth-century location might reflect an earlier arrangement, this source cannot be used as compelling proof that the warming room occupied this position in the twelfth century. Bernard's description of the course followed by the claustral prior in the Ordo Cluniacensis of 1086 indicates that the warming room in the eastern extremity of the south range at Cluny also served as a passage to the novitiate which was located to the south of the cloister.33 33 Ordo Cluniacensis, per Bernardum, Pars. I, Caput III ed. Herrgott 1726, 143. In most English plans this area between the east range and the refectory in the south range also forms a passage between the cloister yard and the area to the south. In cases like Finchale, where the area is only 5 feet wide, it could have served only as a passage, but in others, such as Lewes or Castle Acre, where it is 25 feet wide, it could have served the additional function of warming room as did the 25-foot space in the same position at Cluny.34 34 Hope, 1895, 138, assigned the calefactory to the south range at Castle Acre. If this area at Castle Acre had been intended solely as a passage, it probably would have been made no more than 10 feet wide, as the passage in the east range was. It can, however, only be concluded that insufficient evidence makes it impossible to determine with certainty the location of the warming room in eleventh- and twelfth-century English monasteries. It is possible that the location varied from place to place. Whether the warming room was in the south range as at Cluny (fig. 515) or in the southern half of the east range, as it may have been at Thetford (fig. 517), its area is greatly reduced in size from the area of the warming room which covered the entire ground floor of the east range on the Plan of St. Gall. At Thetford it would have occupied an area of no more than three bays. A comparison of the relative areas of the warming rooms of St. Gall (7), Cluny (1.3), Thetford (2.5), and Castle Acre (1.2) shows that St. Gall is two and one-half to five times larger.35 35 The figures in parentheses are obtained by dividing the actual square feet by a factor of 500. Mettler suggested that the reduction in size met the new demands of asceticism of the Cluniac reform.36 36 Mettler, 1927, 31. Although the smaller area could have been due to a change in ideals, it may also simply have resulted from changes in other parts of the east range. In the ninth century, according to Adalhard, the warming room served as a place where the monks could meet for conversation at certain hours.37 37 Consuetudines Corbeienses, ed. Semmler, Corp. Cons. Mon., I, 1963, 418, and translation III, 123. Passages in Ekkehardus IV, as has been previously pointed out, indicate that in the early eleventh century the warming room, at least at St. Gall, served also as a chapter house.38 38 See above, p. 336. After separate rooms (the new chapter house and an inner auditorium) had been provided for these functions, it may have seemed that a large room was no longer necessary. A change in the heating methods between the ninth and the eleventh century also may have influenced the reduction in size. Harold Brakspear suggested that the scarcity of fireplaces in English monasteries is due to the fact "that in Benedictine houses there was no fireplace in the commonhouse, but that in cold weather it was lighted on the floor or in a brazier and the smoke was allowed to find its way out of the windows, as was usual in domestic halls."39 39 Brakspear, 1937, 104, note 8. Wood, 1965, 257, also states that the central hearth, with an opening or louver in the roof for the escape of smoke was usual in the aisled halls of the thirteenth century and earlier and that it was only gradually superseded by the wall fireplace, the change taking place on the whole in the early fifteenth century. The hypocaust system seen on the Plan of St. Gall could heat a large area; an open fire on the floor could not.40 40 For a full discussion of the various heating devices used in the Plan of St. Gall, see above, pp. 117-132. With the method that Brakspear suggests a smaller room could be more easily heated. This method of heating might also explain why in some cases, as at Cluny II, the warming room was moved from the east to the south range. There was usually no upper story in the southern range so nothing prevented the smoke from escaping directly through an opening or louver in the roof. Such a louver would not have been possible if the warming room were beneath the dormitory. Moving the warming room to the south range may have also reduced the chance of the dormitory catching fire. At any rate, the arrangement set forth on the Plan of St. Gall was altered, and the new position of the warming room at Cluny and in some English monasteries was also adopted in Cistercian monasteries. VI. 4 LAYOUT OF THE CISTERCIAN MONASTERY IN THE TWELFTH AND THIRTEENTH CENTURIES VI.4.1 CONTINUITY WITH THE BENEDICTINE ARRANGEMENT The tendency in the earliest Cistercian monasteries was to follow the Benedictine cloister layout, changing it as little as possible, and it is only later in adapting to new needs that the layout is altered. The Cistercians did not originate as a movement in opposition to that of the Benedictines, not even in opposition to their own house.1 1 Mahn, 1945, 42. The group of twenty that left Molesme in 1098 wished only to observe more strictly the Rule of St. Benedict for themselves and naturally retained the traditional cloister layout that they had known as Benedictine monks. Accordingly, the location of officinae in the Cistercian cloister remains essentially that developed by the Benedictines in the eleventh century. Article 55 of the Ecclesiastica Officia of the Consuetudines Cistercienses of 1134, which mentions the areas that should be sprinkled with holy water each Sunday, sets forth the following order: church, chapter house, inner parlor (auditorium), dormitory, warming room, refectory, kitchen, and cellar.2 2 Guignard, 1878, 152. "Et habens sparsorium alius claustrum aspergat et officinas, scilicet capitulum, auditorium, dormitorium, et dormitorii necessaria, calefactorium, refectorium, coquinam, cellarium." Except for the omission of the storehouse (camera), this list is the same as that given in the Farfa description of the conventual buildings at Cluny. The typical Cistercian east range as seen for example on the plan of Kirkstall Abbey, West Riding, (fig. 519), like the Cluniac plan of Castle Acre Priory (fig. 518), includes from north to south on the ground floor a chapter house, parlor (auditorium), stairs to the dormitory, passage to the infirmary, and an additional room on the south end which may have served as a supply room, as it did at Cluny, or as the novitiate.3 3 Aubert, I, 1947, 118-22, cites three texts which indicate that the area in the east range directly to the south of the infirmary passage may have served as a novitiate. Hope, 1900, 348, suggested that part of the south end of the east range may have served as storage space for garden tools since the two southernmost bays are open on three sides in some English houses, as at Furness and probably originally at Fountains. Sharpe, 1874, pt. I, p. 18; pt. II, 14, first suggested that this area was a fratry, which he defined as a day room or living room for the monks. He implied that this use was indicated in certain Cistercian chronicles, unfortunately without disclosing his sources. No one since has found such a reference, but others have continued to elaborate on Sharpe's theory. Mettler, 1909, 46, Aubert, I, 1947, 122, and Sowers, 1951, 347, 349, see the fratry, a day room, or salle de moines, as being introduced in the late twelfth or early thirteenth century when the monks switched from field to indoor work. It should be pointed out that no one has brought forth concrete evidence that such a room existed. As in the Benedictine plan, the dormitory forms the second story of the east range and opens into the latrine, which is at right angles to its south end. Two features commonly appearing in the Cistercian east range which also appeared on the Plan of St. Gall and which may have appeared in Benedictine planning, are direct communication from the dormitory to the church by night stairs and the location of the sacristy near the south transept. The Cistercian abbot, like the eleventh-century Benedictine abbot, was at first required to sleep in the monks' dormitory.4 4 The arrangements in some monasteries and a text describing Bernard's sleeping place indicate that while the abbot technically slept in the company of the monks, his bed, located at the head of the night stairs, was slightly apart from the monks' dormitory. (Vacandard, 1910, 71; Aubert, II, 1947, 92.) The room above the chapter house may have sometimes had this use. This room may be open to the dormitory as at Fountains (Hope, 1900, 352) or separate from it as at Kirkstall (Hope, 1907, 31). Only later in the thirteenth century did he have a house of his own. This was usually located between the monks' cloister and the infirmary to the east, as at Kirkstall (fig. 519) and Fountains (fig. 520) and so was further removed from the outside world than was the Benedictine abbot's house. The location of the peripheral buildings also tends to perpetuate the Benedictine arrangement. In the 1708 plan of Clairvaux, for example, the infirmary is still to the east of the cloister, the guest houses and stables to the northwest, and the mills and workshops to the south.5 5 Aubert, I, 1947, 11. Whenever possible, the traditional arrangements first set forth on the Plan of St. Gall still appear. Only as a response to new needs is the layout changed. VI.4.2 ADAPTATION OF THE WEST RANGE FOR LAY BROTHERS The Cistercians stressed St. Benedict's ruling that the monastery should be self-sustaining and further proposed to live entirely on produce cultivated by their own members.6 6 Guignard, 1878, 72. Towards this goal manual labor was re-established as a basic monastic obligation for the monks. But, in order to maintain the economic independence of the monastery and attend to outlying farms without interfering with the monks' full observance of the rule within the monastery, lay brothers were attached to the monastic body. The introduction of the lay brothers as a permanent segment of the monastic community was the innovation which most significantly affected the layout of the Cistercian monastery. WEST RIDING, YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND. KIRKSTALL ABBEY. PLAN 519.B KIRKSTALL ABBEY. SITE PLAN 1:8,000 519.A Most of the church and all primary claustral structures date from 1152-1175. Its rapid construction and unusually complete preservation made Kirkstall, among Cistercian ruins of England, an exciting visual experience. The east range is virtually identical with corresponding ranges at Bardney, Thetford, and Castle Acre. On the ground floor are: chapter house (originally con- tained within the range, but in the 13th century expan- ded eastward), parlor, day stairs to dormitory, passageway to buildings lying east of the cloister, and an undercroft of uncertain purpose. The dormitory extended over the entire length of this range, termina- ting in the south with the monks' latrine. In the south range the refectory, initially parallel to the southern cloister walk, was soon after completion repositioned at right angles, thus allowing installation of a warming room to its east, and a kitchen-brewhouse to its west. The new refectory, originally of one storey, was in the 15th century divided into two levels, the lower serving as a MISERICORD (where meat was served in violation of the original rules). The west range, like its eastern counterpart, was formed by a two-storey building, accommodating in the undercroft cellar and refectory of the lay brothers, and overhead their dormitory that extended the entire length of the range, terminating in the south with the latrine attached at an oblique angle over a water channel. An infirmary hall and a guest house were added in the 13th century, the former to the east and the latter at some distance west of the cloister. Lay brothers had existed in other orders, but only in the Cistercian order were they instituted in a form and to an extent that called for special housing within the inner cloister.7 7 Guignard, 1878, 72, 283, 284. The lay brothers were to be treated like the monks themselves and took vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, but they were freer to devote themselves to the manual chores since they did not have to take part in all the religious observances, were permitted to work more than the regular hours allotted to the monks for manual work, and could live outside the monastery on the granges. Since the lay brothers often outnumbered the monks, a large area was needed to shelter and feed them.8 8 Aubert, I, 1947, 54 mentions that at the height of the order the lay brothers exceeded the number of regular monks, often by a considerable margin. At Rievaulx, for example, around 1150, there were 140 monks and 500 lay brothers, at Clairvaux 200 monks and 300 lay brothers, and at Vaucelles 107 monks and 130 lay brothers. The lay brothers' daily schedule differed greatly from that of the monks; accordingly they needed a place apart where they would not interfere with the monks' routine. Like the monks, the lay brothers were required to sleep in a common dormitory, eat the same food, and attend required mass at regular hours each day. Their quarters needed to be within easy access of the church and their refectory close to the kitchen which they shared with the monks. The east range belonged traditionally to the monks. No written source designates which part of the cloister housed the lay brothers, but the cloister buildings themselves indicate that the traditional Benedictine west range was adapted for this purpose.9 9 Sharpe, 1874, pt. II, 13-16, first pointed this out. In order to accommodate the large number of lay brothers, the Cistercian west range was extended beyond the cloister square to the south and arranged to nearly duplicate the monks' living facilities in the east range. The lay brothers' dormitory occupied the entire second floor of the west range; their latrine was located at an angle to its south end. The ground floor of the west range was divided in the center by a passage. The area to the left of this passage was usually the cellar, traditionally located in the west range of the cloister. To the right of the passage was the lay brothers' refectory. The lay brothers not only had their own refectory, dormitory and latrine, but usually had a separate infirmary to the west. In some cases they may even have had a separate warming room and auditorium.10 10 Mettler, 1909, 45, 7, 9, points out that Article 15 of the Usus mentions an auditorium after the kitchen in a list of rooms of the cloister which is otherwise that of Article 55. Sowers, 1951, 329, lists a calefactory, but does not mention his source. Except for the fact that lay brothers and monks were served from the same kitchen, there actually existed two monasteries in one, parallel to each other, one on the east and the other on the west side of the cloister yard, with little contact between the two.11 11 Aubert, I, 1947, 316-17. In a similar way the east half of the church was the choir of the monks, and the western half that of the lay brothers, with the choir of the infirmi between. In some monasteries, such as Kirkstall (fig. 519), an open lane of almost twice the width of the monks' cloister walk lay between the west range and the monks' cloister, from which it was cut off by a solid masonry wall. In other monasteries the west range lay directly along the west walk of the monks' cloister. The two arrangements exist side by side, but the west range separated by a lane may possibly be the older type since it exists in the first monasteries of the order, Clairvaux and Citeaux.12 12 Mettler, 1909, 100, thought that only in the earliest arrangements the lay brothers' range was separated from the cloister by a wall and a lane and that later they were omitted because the lay brothers were then less strictly separated from the life of the monks. Sowers, 1951, 334, 335, finds such a change is reflected in no other aspect of cloister life and rejects it as the reason for the two types of west ranges, since the two exist side by side during St. Bernard's lifetime. The two types are constructed concurrently, as for example at Roche Abbey (Yorkshire) and Byland Abbey (Yorkshire) and a general reason for the development of the two types has not been determined.13 13 Both Mettler, 1909, 99, and Sowers, 1951, 333, suggest that the Cistercian lay brothers' range, isolated by a lane, may have developed out of the lodging of famuli over the stables to the west of the cloister at Cluny. This seems unlikely. For Cluny see above, p. 333ff. The lane for the lay brothers may have originated as a small cloister yard, since it is twice as wide as would have been necessary for it to serve only as a passage to the church. In some monasteries, such as the one at Byland, it was even fitted with stone benches. In monasteries without a lane the lay brothers would have merely congregated in the area west of their quarters to which exterior day stairs gave access, as at Fountains (fig. 520). The introduction of a special lane for the lay brothers at the place which in the Benedictine plan was occupied by the western cloister walk in a certain sense insulated the outer parlor from the monks' cloister. Although no Cistercian document mentions an entrance or an outer parlor where the monks could meet with seculars, one or two bays, as can be seen at Kirkstall (fig. 519) and at Fountains (fig. 520), are usually divided off from the cellar on the north end of the west range next to the church, and must have served this traditional purpose. In order to pass from the outer parlor to the door near the south end of the lay brothers' lane, which gave access to the inner cloister at Kirkstall and at Clairvaux (fig. 521), it was necessary to cross the length of the lay brothers' lane. The lay brothers' lane thus separated the cloister from the place in which the monk had contact with seculars. And in the same way the lay brothers' quarters themselves acted as a buffer between the monks and the outside world. VI.4.3 RESULTING ALTERATIONS IN THE SOUTH RANGE The accommodation of the west range for the lay brothers not only complicated the traditional plan of the west range, but also altered the shape of the south side of the cloister. In the earliest Cistercian monasteries the monks' refectory PLAN: FOUNTAINS ABBEY 520.A 520.B YORKSHIRE, ENGLAND Yorkshire Archaeological Journal, XV(1900), &amp; Fountains Abbey (Hodges), 1904 "There is no other place in the country in which the mind can so readily evoke the picture of 13th-century monastic life, and the eye the picture of the vast extent and yet the crispness and freshness of Cistercian architecture in the wild North Country forests."—N. Pevsner, THE BUILDINGS OF ENGLAND, YORKSHIRE, THE WEST RIDING, London, 1959, 203-04. At Fountains Abbey the conventional Cistercian scheme was transformed into one of the most amazing examples of architectural site planning of which there is record or remains. Here a vast monastic complex, in reach a thousand feet long, embraces the River Skell as it flows gently north and eastward to the Ure, in an architectural composition in which monastery structures rose from foundations laid in the stream bed, and other buildings daringly straddled the channeled Skell in an extraordinary work of applied hydraulics and structural engineering. We know of no other monastic planning like Fountains, married to the waters of a river, where monumental symmetry of church and cloister blends harmoniously with oblique oxial configurations, akew to the nave, to conform to the winding stream. In the abbey's final state, complex functional relations of internal planning and composition of buildings, courts, yards, and galleries are resolved with effortless ease and beauty, giving no hint of deception where sophisticated mastery of planning blends structures, water site, and natural setting into one of the great works of art of medieval England. The accomplishment of Fountains is the more remarkable a feat of human ingenuity for the site, anything but ideal, was inconvenient of access and too narrow to accommodate the eventual complement of buildings comprising the monastery. Fountains was founded in 1132 by discontented monks of St. Mary's Abbey, York, who established themselves in the wild, densely wooded valley of the Skell by raising some wooden huts and a timbered oratory. Its permanent buildings, constructed when funds became available, belong to three distinct periods: The church was built between 1135 and 1147. It originally had a rectangular choir that gave way, in the 13th century, to a new and larger presbytery terminating in a second transept. Between 1147 and 1179 were built all three claustral ranges and, west of the cloister in a bend of the Skell, two guest houses as well as the lay brothers' infirmary, the latter bridging the stream and connecting with their dormitory by a latrine also built over the river. Between 1243 and 1247 the new choir of the church and an entire cluster of buildings were erected east of the cloister; most notable among them the monks' infirmary, an aisled building 190 feet long and 80 feet wide, and like the lay brothers' infirmary, bridging the stream. The western approach to the monastery is breathtaking. The valley is blocked in its entire width by a two-storey structure 307 feet long and 40 feet wide that extends from the facade of the church full course across the river. In the under-croft of this building are cellar and refectory of the lay brothers; above is their dormitory. The location of this wing and all other claustral structures is in full accord with general Cistercian standards: refectory in the south range at right angles to the cloister yard and flanked by kitchen and warming room; the kitchen placed so it can serve both monks and lay brothers; chapterhouse in the east range at right angles to the cloister yard; above it the dormitory but coaxial with the transcept over an undercroft that overshoots the south range nearly as much as the refectory; two latrines attached to the dormitory at right angles. An incomprehensible peculiarity is the abbot's lodging (1135-1147) built across the eastern end of the two latrines. Between it and the monks' infirmary lies the MISERICORD and eating hall, where sick monks, if their conditions warranted, could be served meat. The abbey was dissolved in 1539 and came into secular hands. Its present excellent state of preservation owes to the fact that in 1768 it became part of the grounds of Studley Royal, whose owner, William Aislabie, "with arrogant self-confidence and stupendous success" used its remains "as the obligatory ruin in a landscape garden, in which temples of fame and piety and other garden ornaments were not lacking either" (Pevsner, loc. cit.). lay parallel to the southern cloister walk, as was traditional in Benedictine abbeys, but by at least the third quarter of the twelfth century, the axis of the refectory had been rotated ninety degrees so that it came to lie at right angles to the southern cloister walk. In Benedictine monasteries, as at Cluny, it was possible to place the refectory parallel to the southern cloister walk and still include the warming room and the kitchen on the same axis, because the southern range could be extended westward without limitation. In some English Benedictine monasteries the kitchen was taken out of the range and moved south of the refectory. In Cistercian monasteries, however, one kitchen served both the lay brothers and the monks. The Cistercians preferred to keep this kitchen within the south range, between the refectory of the monks and that of the lay brothers. From this position, food could be more quickly and easily served to both refectories than would have been possible had the kitchen stood outside the cloister.14 14 Thompson, 1954, 12. The refectories were sometimes directly served from the kitchen by means of turntables in the east and west walls. The Cistercians also kept the warming room in the south range as it was at Cluny and in some Benedictine houses. But the south range of the Cistercian plan, unlike that of the Benedictines, could not be extended to the south since here its path was blocked by the quarters for the lay brothers. Seeing a specific site, such as Kirkstall Abbey (fig. 519), illustrates the problem which the Cistercians faced. In the original south range of 1152 the axis of the refectory was parallel to the cloister walk in the traditional east-west orientation, but in 1182 it was turned by ninety degrees so as to run from north to south. The southern range of 1152, with the refectory aligned east and west, was 105 feet long and 30 feet wide. The refectory itself was 70 feet long; to the west of the refectory stood a kitchen 19 feet long and to the east was an area 16½ feet long that was probably the warming room.15 15 An area 16½ × 30 feet seems rather small for a warming room, and since no original fireplace remains, it is possible that this area was only a passage to the south, as it might have been in some Benedictine houses. However, there is no fireplace indicating a warming room in the east range either. Hope, therefore, may have been correct in assigning the original warming room to this place in the southern range. See Hope, 1907, 4, 52. Had this space been only a passage, it would have needed to be no wider than the passage in the east range. However, it is twice as wide. One wonders, therefore, whether this area may not have performed the dual function of passage and warming room as did the corresponding space at Cluny II (fig. 515). Kirkstall's passage (495 square feet), to be sure is somewhat smaller than the warming room in the southern walk at Cluny (625 square feet), but so are all the other rooms in the original south range of Kirkstall. The total length of the second refectory, warming room and kitchen of 1182 was 174 feet. Given the desired size of the new buildings, the axis of the refectory of 1182 could not have been placed east and west. Even if the Cistercians at Kirkstall had wished to extend the proposed south range across the lay brothers' lane, which provided 25 feet more to the west, it would still have been 45 feet AUBE, FRANCE. CLAIRVAUX ABBEY 521.A VIEW FROM SOUTH 521.B PLAN ENGRAVINGS OF DOM MILLEY, 1708 PARIS, CABINET DES ESTAMPES, Topgraphie de la France, Aube, Bar-sur-Aube, fols 27 and 29. [by courtesy of the Cabinet des Estampes] Founded in 1115 by Stephen Harding, the abbey CLARA VALLIS, through Bernard of Clairvaux's efforts and unique reputation, rose to spectacular heights and soon accommodated 700 monks and lay brothers. It became one of the most famous monasteries of the occident, with eighty daughter affiliations and sixty-six nunneries, spread over twelve different countries. The order owed its wealth and rapid expansion to a new concept of labor, in which responsibilities of agricultural management and exploitation of its rich lands were transmitted to a vast force of lay brothers, thus making the monastery independent of the work of tenants and serfs, as well as the duties of assuming care for the latter's livelihood. A first settlement and church (MONASTERIUM VETUS) dedicated in 1115 had to be replaced as early as 1135-1145 because of the community's rapid growth. The new monastery (MONASTERIUM NOVUM) was built in the broader section of the valley, immediately to the east of the original site. Its square choir and square transept chapels exercised a profound influence on the layout of the churches of Clairvaux's daughter houses; but these fixtures were replaced between 1154 and 1174 by a new and larger choir with circular apse and radiating chapels (cf. Jean Dorothy Owens, "Early Cistercian architecture in Burgundy: The Bernardian Plan," Master's Thesis, University of California, Berkeley, 1971). The abbey was secularized in 1792 and during the next three decades was reduced to a shambles, some of the remaining buildings being used as a prison for women. The church itself was systematically dismantled in 1819. We are nevertheless fortunate in being able to form a clear picture of the architectural and topographical layout of the monastery by means of a plan and two superb engravings drawn in 1708 by Dom Milley, at a time when the monastery was still substantially in the form it had acquired by the end of the 12th century. The church on these engravings is shown in the state it had attained in 1154-1174; but the cloister, with its refectory at right angles to the south range and its east and west ranges projecting boldly beyond the boundaries of the cloister square, belong to the period of 1135-1145, and served as a model for the claustral layout of many of the English monasteries discussed on the preceding pages. * NOTE ON THE SCALE OF THE PLAN The graphic scale of the engraving reads Scala mensoria Centum Hexapedarum. The old French measure of length, the hexapedarum or toise, 6 pied de roi, was equivalent to 2.135 yards or 1.949 meters. The pied de roi may be taken as 1.066 feet. The asterisks by the right margin of the plan mark intervals of 500 feet, the symbols in the left margin, 100 meters. PLAN SHOWN AT SCALE 1:4500 too long. To keep all the buildings in the south range and yet provide space for a sufficient increase in size, the only possible solution was to rotate the refectory so that its short end abutted the south cloister walk. In this way the surface area of the kitchen and warming room at Kirkstall could be doubled, ten hundred square feet could be added to the refectory, and the layman's lane could still be kept open to the south. At Clairvaux (fig. 521) the axis of the refectory is shown at right angles to the southern range in the plan of the monastery drawn in 1708 by Dom Milley.16 16 Williams, 1935, 396, gives an enlarged plan and key for Dom Milley's plan of 1708. The second abbey of Clairvaux was begun in 1135 on a new site when the first abbey of 1116 became too small. The work was far enough along by 1145 for a first consecration of the church.17 17 The consecration is referred to in the Collectanea or Fragmenta Gaudfridi, written in 1145 (Paris, Bib. Nat. MS. lat. 17639, fol. 10v; cf. E. Vacandard, 1910, 421, and introduction xxi). At that time all of the principal claustral structures must also have been in place since the first book of the Vita Prima whose author died in 1147 or 1148 referred to the transfer of the monastery to its new site as an accomplished fact.18 18 Vita Prima, book I, chap. 7, par. 34; cf. Migne, Patr. Lat., CLXXXV: 1, 1879, col. 247. If Dom Milley's plan reflects the building campaign before Saint Bernard's death in 1153, as Paul Jeulin believes, the ninety-degree turn of the refectory was undertaken at Clairvaux toward the middle of the twelfth century, long before the change can be demonstrated at Kirkstall.19 19 Jeulin, 1953, 327. In England the earliest known example of a refectory facing the south walk with its narrow end is that of 1170-79 at Fountains Abbey20 20 Hope, 1900, 369, 370, however, feels that its lack of alignment might suggest that this stone refectory was constructed outside of a temporary timber refectory with the same axis which built was sometime between the fire of 1147 and the rebuilding in stone around 1170. (fig. 520). If the innovation was made at Clairvaux by the middle of the century it is strange that it would not have been copied by the closely affiliated English monasteries before the third quarter of the century. In the planning of the new monastery of Clairvaux, however, the documented aim was to provide for future expansion to accommodate the daily increasing number of brothers, and the new north-south orientation of the Cistercian refectory would be in accord with this goal.21 21 Williams, 1935, 56. In its new position the refectory, like the dormitories of the monks and lay brothers, offered the possibility of future expansion to the south of the cloister.22 22 Aubert, I, 1947, 118, suggested that the Cistercians moved the warming room out of the east range into the south range with the consequent rotation of the refectory in order to make room for a salle des moines in the east range. At Kirkstall, the one demonstrable example we have of the Cistercian arrangement before the refectory was rotated, it is likely that the warming room was included in the south range when the refectory was aligned east and west, thus repeating the earlier Cluniac arrangement. Moreover, if a salle des moines ever existed, it would not have been introduced at the time the refectory was rotated. Sowers, 1957, 347, 349, mentions that the change from field to indoor labor, when a salle des moines could have become necessary, did not take place before the late twelfth or early thirteenth century. Since the time of the Plan of St. Gall the east range and the west range had been extended southward beyond the south range of the cloister. This blocked any possibility of extending the south range along its axis either eastward or westward. The reorganization of the east and west ranges required that the warming room and the kitchen be accommodated in the south range; the only way to provide enough space along the southern cloister walk was to turn the refectory to a north and south axis. In the Cistercian cloister plan three parallel arms now extended to the south of the simple cloister square seen on the Plan of St. Gall. The inner cloister had also been opened up in order to gain a freer interaction with the buildings around it. On the Plan of St. Gall it was connected with the rest of the complex at only one point, the entrance through the parlor in the west range. Efficient communication demands more openings in the claustral block. In the Benedictine and Cistercian monastic plans of the twelfth century, a passage between the auditorium and camera of the east range connects the monks' cloister directly with the infirmary to the east. Between the east range and the refectory another passage opens the cloister to the south.23 23 Even if the warming room sometimes may have been located in this space, it probably served at times as a passage, as was the practice at Cluny II seen in the description of the route of the claustral prior of Cluny. See above, p. 338. These passages are often aligned with the south and east walks of the cloister, giving a new feeling of spatial expansion to the cloister. Moreover, the covered walks joining the monks' cloister and the infirmary, as can be seen on the Plan of Christchurch, Canterbury, and at Kirkstall (figs. 52 and 519), actually form a new courtyard and thus extend the enclosed claustral area to which the monks have access. In the Cistercian plan, as at Fountains (fig. 520), the extensions of the east range, west range, and refectory beyond the cloister to the south enclose on three sides two southern court-like areas which, perhaps, were also used as additional claustral space.24 24 Sowers, 1951, 352. Wood partitions sometimes enclosed these areas to the south, and benches were set up. VI. 5 CONCLUSION The paradigmatic arrangement embodied in the Plan of St. Gall was altered by later Benedictines and Cistercians responding to the interactions of new spiritual objectives with practical adjustments to changing physical demands. In the eleventh century, in the face of a rigorous reinterpretation of the Benedictine Rule, the auditorium was added to the ground floor in the east range, the result of an increased concern for claustral silence. To avoid the implications of privilege, the abbot was no longer permitted separate quarters but more completely led a life in common with the monks, sleeping in their dormitory. In the twelfth century, the Cistercians introduced a large lay-brother population into regular monastic life in order to maintain a self-sustaining monastery without compromising religious aims. This burden of population made necessary the remodeling and extension of the west range with the consequent alteration of the south range. The establishment of a separate chapter house in the east range provided a permanent meeting place protected from inclement weather, a change apparently founded in practical considerations. Yet the reason for its location as near as possible to the church may have been hierarchical: spiritual matters taken up in chapter-house meetings were second in importance only to those taken up in the church. However, the decision to open the inner cloister for more efficient communication with the rest of the complex seems to have been made for utilitarian reasons and paradoxically, almost at the expense of the privacy it existed to assure for spiritual ends. Other alterations were the results of functional changes. The separate novitiate seen on the Plan of St. Gall may have been eliminated because the number of oblati diminished towards the end of the eleventh century and the novices could then be more easily included within the cloister of the monks. The warming room was made smaller as other officinae that took over functions it had once served were added to the east range, limiting the space available for it. And, at the same time, the size of the warming room may have been reduced to adapt to heating methods of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, methods which in fact also influenced its relocation to the south range of some monasteries. Yet, when these changes were made, care was taken to preserve the traditional monastic arrangement. In the eleventh century the Cluniacs and autonomous Benedictines subdivided the ground floor of the east range to provide additional rooms within the established plan instead of adding new buildings to the basic cloister square. In the twelfth century the Cistercians, faced with the necessity of combining two independent living units, again preserved the four-sided cloister by compressing all the lay brothers' living facilities into the west range of the cloister. When this solution in turn crowded the south range, the Cistercians turned the refectory ninety degrees in order to keep the traditional sequence of officinae in the south range, yet still retaining the interior cloister square framed by four enclosing walls. Although additions were made to each range of the cloister, the essential function of each side remained that seen on the Plan of St. Gall. The east range housed the monk. In the south range his food was prepared and served. The west range provided and stored his daily sustenance. Upon the north, the church sheltered his cloister. Respect for tradition is a characteristic feature of monastic life; as with customs, the claustral arrangement was respected and preserved. Once perfected, the arrangement became traditional and was altered only within the larger understanding encompassed by tradition. EPILOGUE Superbly executed, and possibly the most accomplished architectural creation of the age of Charlemagne, the Plan of St. Gall owes its existence to a striving for cultural unity that pervaded the whole of Carolingian life: unity embodied in a common language, Latin; a common belief, Christianity; a common legal and spiritual authority vested in the offices of Emperor and Pope; and unity of monastic custom and observance. It was the search for unity in the conduct of monastic practice—unitas regulae—that by inner necessity also required creation of an ideal scheme to standardize and guide monastic architecture for the future. That scheme is transmitted to us in the Plan of St. Gall. In the new agricultural society that arose north of the Alps the monastery acquired the structure of a vast manorial estate, including within the monastic enceinte a large contingent of serfs and workmen. This development called for the establishment of an inner fortress, in which the monks could perform their spiritual offices without being exposed to contamination by the secular world. The need for such segregation led to the adoption of the four-cornered cloister as a standard form of monastic housing. The architectural formula selected to assure this protection—together with that of the church, with which it now entered into a lasting symbiosis—was Late Antique, but antiquity reshaped in the very process of its revival along modular spatial concepts that had roots in the North, and harbored the germ for development of an architectural style (Romanesque and Gothic) without precedent in the Greek, Roman, or Christian worlds. One of the most striking qualities of the plan that emerged from these historical preconditions is that, although aimed at the ideal, its features were governed by an overriding awareness of function: the assurance of architectural proximity where proximity was dictated by need, of separation where separation was a spiritual imperative, of scaling of each structure to dimensions not larger, but never smaller than required by its intended use. This acute assessment of the monastery's functional parameters determined that the architectural scheme of the Plan of St. Gall would exert lasting influence on the future, allowing it to survive under the stress of changes never foreseen in the original concept. The layout of the claustral ranges delineated on the Plan of St. Gall was of monumental simplicity: three masonry buildings of virtually identical length and width, ranged in U-formation around a large open court that was closed on its fourth side by the massive bulk of the church. These structures were double-storied but otherwise internally undivided. In subsequent centuries the dramatic simplicity of this concept was marred by insertion of a chapter house and other unexpected additions that forced extension of the east and west ranges beyond the boundaries of the cloister square. The claustral scheme was exposed to further stress when the Cistercians, in re-evaluating manual labor as being a proper monastic occupation, drew their entire agricultural work force into housing in the west range of the cloister square. This intrusion of lay brothers into the claustral compound produced a chain reaction in the repartitioning of space, which could forever have destroyed the unity of the claustral scheme had it not been safeguarded by the ingenuity of extraordinary modifications: the creation of supplementary spaces in the south range by swinging the refectory around so as to face the cloister with one narrow end; the use of the same kitchen for both lay brothers and monks; and the extension of both eastern and western ranges even further beyond the boundaries of the cloister square. In the grouping of the primary building masses around an open inner court, the original concept still prevailed, but the philosophical integrity of claustral seclusion was shattered by installation of lay brothers in one of the primary cloister wings. The artificial partition of the cloister yard into a primary area for monks, and a narrow lane for lay brothers destroyed aesthetically as well as ideologically the conceptual unity of the original scheme. In the pursuit of these new goals the church fared no better. Bisected into two visually segregated areas, one for monks, the other for lay brothers, it lost the unitary beauty of which it was possessed in Carolingian and pre-Cistercian times. These modifications reflected both an internal change in the relation of monks to lay brothers, as well as a fundamental change in the relation between monk and society. Under the Carolingian rulers, the monastery had become an integral part of the agricultural, administrative, and educational fabric of the state. Its economic structure was such as to guarantee not only the physical sustenance of its own people but also to contribute to the livelihood of thousands, if not tens of thousands of secular men and women who lived on the monastery's outlying estates, and paid for that privilege through services rendered in labor and/or the delivery to the abbot of a tenth of their agricultural produce. The Cistercians, by contrast, tilled their land with their own work force, now installed in the cloister itself or within walled enclosures of outlying granges. The Order received from these establishments not merely a percentage of their production, but all of it. This quickly led to great monastic riches, but it lifted the monastery out of the social fabric state, and in this manner contributed to its own eventual, inevitable, alienation. MONOGRAM Drawing from a silver coin, somewhat enlarged. Boundless imagination and invention are displayed in the arrangement of letters comprising the monogram that dates to the second period of Carolingian coinage. It appears on the obverse of the coin and spells KAROLUS (as illustrated) or KARLUS (in Period I the spelling is CAROLUS). The same freedom seen in graphic and sculptural design in coins of Period II is paralleled by radical transformations of this period in concepts of minting money— changes which created a new monetary system for Europe for long afterward. The coinage system reforms established under Charlemagne constitute the most important in the monetary history of Europe. W.H. 1978 522. ST. GALL: PLAN OF THE BAROQUE CHURCH SHOWING EXCAVATIONS OF 1964-1966 WORK PRINT SUPPLIED BY H.R.S. The areas of work described in the following paragraphs may be located on Dr. Sennhauser's plan, with which he was kind enough to provide as together with the information briefly set forth on these two pages. VI.6 INTERIM REPORT Excavations beneath the Pavement of the Church of St. Gall Conducted by Dr. H. R. Sennhauser, 1964-1966 In summer, 1970, Dr. Hans Rudolf Sennhauser was kind enough to furnish me an advance report of the results of excavations that he conducted from 1964 to 1966 under the auspices of the Eidgenössiche Kommission für Denkmalpflege. The work was prompted by installation of a new heating system which made accessible the medieval strata beneath the pavement of the present church of St. Gall. The full story of the exciting discoveries made during the investigation will be told in the comprehensive and copiously illustrated report, now being prepared by the director of the excavations. I feel deeply obliged to Dr. Sennhauser for permitting me to touch on some of his most important findings and to illustrate them with the plan at the left (fig. 522). EXTENT OF EXCAVATIONS Access was gained to the area beneath the pavement of the nave and aisles of the church, as well as to terrain beneath the pavement of the rotunda. Beneath the aisles of the choir the soil was heavily disturbed by the Gothic reconstruction. In the nave of the choir the only accessible portions were those not occupied by the substructure of the Baroque choir stalls, with the exception of narrow heating conduits which it was necessary to drill across these areas. Inaccessible was terrain beneath the Baroque high altar and the sacristy east of it. In the church itself and between the foundations of the Gothic choir and those of the Baroque church lay a rich trove of remains from earlier churches in a series of strata, each of which could be clearly associated with building activities known through literary sources. Horizons lying above the Gozbert horizon will be fully described and analyzed in Dr. Sennhauser's report. In this short review, concerned only with pre-Carolingian and Carolingian horizons, the Gozbert stratum is used as the site base line (± 0.00 m). THE GALLUS HORIZON: A.D. 612 (- 1.20M) THE OTMAR HORIZONS: A.D. 719 (± 0.86M TO - 0.75M) Below the Gallus stratum, identifiable by its post holes, the terrain lies undisturbed. Above it two levels of Otmar's work could be identified by fragments of masonry foundation, but not enough remained to ascertain the shape of his church. THE GOZBERT HORIZON: A.D. 830-836 (± 0.00M TO - 0.10M) A rich record of Gozbert's work remained about 0.80 m above the lower Otmar horizon. These features were unmistakably identifiable wherever terrain was accessible, and undisturbed by later work: foundation trenches for outer walls, for nave arcades, and for a transverse foundation marking the line where nave and transept met; a number of capitals and abaci of the Carolingian supports re-used in the masonry of the Gothic choir foundations. THE NAVE The floor and parts of the rising masonry of a circumambient corridor crypt were also located, the crypt's longitudinal arms connected in the east by a traverse shaft, in the west by the steps giving access to this crypt. The floor level of the southern shaft was - 2.45 m, that of the northern shaft, - 2.40 m to - 2.46 m. In the middle of the transverse shaft and extending west from it lay the relatively well-preserved rising masonry of a hall crypt ca. 5m deep and ca. 7m wide, but the supports and vaults of this crypt had been demolished and re-used by the builders of the Baroque church. In the center of the western wall of this hall crypt was an opening; behind it the masonry of a tapered shaft rose upward at a gentle slope toward the old base of the sarcophagus of St. Gall, which in Carolingian times stood on a higher level some 2.00 m west of the crypt. The eastern-oriented end of the sarcophagus was thus brought in view of the visiting pilgrims. In the middle of the east wall of the transverse shaft was an opening and masonry of a window with splayed jambs, the existence and location of which suggests that the choir of Gozbert's church had no apse, but may rather have terminated in a straight wall. UNIDENTIFIABLE FEATURES No longer identifiable owing to disturbance by work later than Gozbert, or else inaccessible to excavation, were: location and shape of the nave arcades of Gozbert's church, their foundations and rising masonry having been cleared away for re-use in the Baroque church, as well as supports and vaults of the hall crypt which were demolished, then renewed by the builders of the Baroque church. Nor was it possible to determine the position of Gozbert's high altar, for the terrain west of the sarcophagus of St. Gall was heavily disturbed by service channels associated with mechanisms of the Baroque organ. Dr. Sennhauser thinks it possible that the Carolingian high altar might have been located east of the tomb of St. Gall on the elevated floor level supported by the vaults of the crypt. Lack of access permitted no determination of the foundations of the eastern crossing piers (if they ever existed) which would have lain in the substructure of the Baroque choir stalls. The outer surface of the east wall of the transverse shaft of the corridor crypt, and the foundations of the apse of Gozbert's church, if there were one, also lay in terrain unable to be explored because of the superincumbent high altar and sacristy of the present church. GOZBERT'S CHURCH AND THE CHURCH OF THE PLAN OF ST. GALL Whether, or in what particulars, Gozbert followed the concepts of the Church of the Plan can only be known when Dr. Sennhauser's full report is published. From the position and course of the foundation trenches, however, it may be inferred that the width of Gozbert's nave was in fact twice the width of each aisle, indicating that he may have followed closely the instruction of the designers of the Plan that the nave of the church be 40 and each aisle, 20 feet wide. THE NAVE The length of Gozbert's church is not yet known because the shape and depth of its apse could not be ascertained. Yet, even on the basis of facts now available, it appears safe to assume that his church was shorter by roughly one third than the Church as it is drawn on the Plan. This suggests that Gozbert held to the mandate of the axial explanatory title of the Church of the Plan directing that it be 200 feet long, rather than the 300 feet shown by the drawing itself. Excavations revealed it to be indisputable that the contraction was made in the longitudinal axis of the church, and was accomplished by a radical shortening of its nave, rather than through diminution of the liturgically important areas of transept and presbytery. (This tends to confirm what is set forth in Volume I, p. 180, and above, pp. 326ff.) THE CRYPT Gozbert's rectangular corridor crypt derives directly from the schema drawn on the Plan. In contrast to it, however, the longitudinal arms of Gozbert's crypt did not run along the crossing piers, but were moved against the outer walls of the church. Moreover, their entrances lay in the aisles, and the arms cross the transept not on floor level, but below it. This is a great functional improvement over the Plan's layout, for it considerably enlarges the space available to monks in the transept, and eliminates disruption of that space by passages used by laymen as transits. Another notable innovation is the introduction of a hall crypt from which laymen could view the tomb of St. Gall. TRANSEPT AND PRESBYTERY The location and course of the circumference walls of this entire eastern body of Gozbert's church disclose that its transept did not project beyond the outer walls of the longitudinal body of the church, as Hardegger had already surmised (see p. 326, above). The loss of space incurred by this amputation would have been compensated by the spatial gain achieved through transfer of the passages for laymen from transept level to below it. There are sound topographical reasons why Gozbert might have preferred an inner transept to one with extended arms. The terrain of the site to the south of the church was constricted by the capricious course of the Steinach River. Gozbert, in studying the Plan, must quickly have seen that on the high ground remaining between church and river, he had insufficient space to accommodate, in addition to the cloister, all the service structures to the south of it. By not extending the transept beyond the aisles of the church, he could substantially mitigate inadequacies of space owing to the topography of the monastery site. The Church of the Plan has an elevated presbytery to which was annexed, on north and south, the two-storied structures housing Scriptorium and Library, Sacristy and Vestry. Dr. Sennhauser found no trace of foundations or their trenches to confirm any similar dispositions in Gozbert's church. From later sources it must be inferred that the Carolingian scriptorium lay to the south of the church, in the cloister. We must therefore deal with the possibility that Gozbert's presbytery extended the whole width of the structure, as it did in the Gothic Church (see fig. 511). If this conjecture is proved correct, it will reveal that Gozbert thus increased, rather than diminished, the area around the high altar. W.H.
