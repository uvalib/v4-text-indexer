In connection with the foregoing list of gifts the following item, recently discovered in the University Collegian, vol. I, No. 2âNovember, 1838,âwill be of interest: "Laudable Donation." "We take pleasure in recording the fact that a lot of valuable books has just been presented to the University Library, by Mr. Peter K. Skinker, who was but lately a student at this institution. This gentleman has now removed to the West, and, in leaving the University, wanted no such memorial as the present to fix his name indelibly amongst us. "The number of books presented is nearly 50, of which many are extensive folios, extremely valuable for their rarity. Judging from this and other similar examples recently set, we are confident of a rapid increase of the Library for some time to come." The Collegian was a literary journal published by the students of the University, and was evidently the precursor of the present magazine. CLASS E. Portraits.

In February, 1900, pursuant to a call issued by the presidents of Harvard, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, Chicago, and the University of California, representatives of the leading American universities met at Chicago; and after careful discussion a permanent organization was formed under the name of "The Association of American Universities." The purpose of the association was defined in the constitution to be the considering of the matters of common interest relating to graduate study. Accordingly, only institutions of high rank, such as are engaged extensively in giving advanced or graduate instruction, were considered eligible to membership in the organization. The fourteen institutions composing the initial or charter membership of the association are the following: University of California, Catholic University of America, University of Chicago, Clark University, Columbia University, Cornell University, Harvard University, Johns Hopkins University, Leland Stanford, Jr., University, University of Michigan, University of Pennsylvania, Princeton University, University of Wisconsin, and Yale University. It was provided that other institutions might be admitted at the annual conference, on the invitation of the executive committee, indorsed by a three-fourths vote of the members of the association. In 1904 the University of Virginia was admitted to membership; and within the last year or so three other institutions, namely, the universities of Illinois, Minnesota, and Missouri, have been received. The total membership at present, therefore, consists of the eighteen institutions named. At the annual meetings such questions as the following are discussed: "Migration among Graduate Students;" "The Type of Examination for the Doctor's Degree;" "Fellowships;" "To What Extent should a Candidate for the Doctor's Degree be Required to Show a Knowledge of Subjects Not Immediately Connected with his Major Subject?" Founder's Day. On April 13 lectures were suspended and the day was occupied in exercises fitted to celebrate the birth of the University's founderâThomas Jefferson. At 11:30 students, faculty, and invited guests marched in procession to Cabell Hall, where the chief address of the occasion was made by Mr. James Bryce, British Ambassador to the United States. President Alderman introduced Mr. Bryce; and after the latter's address, made the annual statement concerning the recent progress and present status of the University. He said, among other things: "Each college year, like each year in the life of an individual, has its distinctive meaning. 1907-'08 in the history of the University will be marked by these notable events: The building of the college dining hall; the opening of the second wing of the hospital; the establishment of `College Hour'; the inaugration of the Barbour-Page Lecture Foundation; and the provision by the State Legislature for a Geological Survey, with headquarters at the University. "The realization of the bequest of Mr. Edmund W. James, realizing $264,656 in endowment for the University; the increased annuity from the Legislature to 80,000 a year, and a provision at last for the building of a worthy and noble home for the Law School of the Institution; the great increases in the teaching staff, of the interior equipment, and in annual income, have been elsewhere noted. To me one of the most attractive and impressive developments in the life of the institution is the increased interest in the development of the University Library, which is the heart of any college." Faculty Notes. One of President Alderman's recent addresses was delivered at Bristol, Va.-Tenn., on April 17, before the final session of the conference of superintendents of public instruction in Southwest Virginia. On April 29, Professor Ormond Stone went to Harrisonburg, Va., where he attended a meeting of the board of visitors of the new normal and industrial school to be established in the near future at the place named. Professor Stone has recently been appointed on the managing board by the Governor; and at the meeting in question was made chairman of the committee on courses of instruction. Dr. John William Mallet, Professor of Chemistry, has been awarded a pension by the Carnegie Board, and will retire from active service at the end of the present session, after 38 years of distinguished work in this university. Dr. Richard Heath Dabney, Professor of History, recently made a short visit to Bridgewater College, Bridgewater, Va., where he served as a judge at an intercollegiate debate held on the evening of April 17. Dr. Charles W. Kent, Professor of English Literature, recently delivered two addresses in Staunton, one on John R. Thompson, at Stuart Hall; the other on Tennyson, at the Mary Baldwin Seminary. At College Hour, Saturday, May 9, the leading address of the occasion was delivered by Dr. Albert Lefevre, Professor of Philosophy. Professor W. H. Heck, Curry Professor of Education, made an address at Memphis, Tenn., April 24, before the final session of the 1908 conference for education in the South. Dr. Bruce R. Payne, Professor of Psychology, recently visited the Augusta Military Academy, Fort Defiance, Va., and the city of Winchester, delivering addresses at both places. Dr. Charles H. Bunting, Professor of Pathology, has resigned his position in order to accept a chair in his alma mater, the University of Wisconsin. On the evening of April 13 the Colonnade Club of the University gave a reception to Mr. and Mrs. Bryce. Among other distinguished foreigners present were Prof. and Mrs. J. B. Bury, of Cambridge University, and Mr. Indu Bhushan de Majumdar, of Calcutta. Debates. On the evening of April 3 Virginia won a unanimous decision in a debate with Johns Hopkins, and lost by two votes in three in a similar contest with North Carolina. The question, "Resolved, that national banks should be permitted to issue, subject to tax and government supervision, notes based on their general assets," was affirmed by Virginia in both contests. The debaters against the Baltimore team were Messrs. T. S. Settle, Maurice Hirsch, and D. R. Fon ville; the last of the law department, the other two of the college; those speaking against the Chapel Hill team were Messrs. S. C. Williams and G. W. Fry, both of the law school. President Alderman was in the chair in the debate with Johns Hopkins, which was held at the University of Virginia; the contest with North Carolina was held in Richmond, and was presided over by Mayor Carlton McCarthy. Oratory. At the final preliminary, April 16, men were chosen to represent the University in oratorical contests; Mr. D. R. Fonville of Burlington, N. C., will enter the Central Oratorical League contest, May 8, at the University; Mr. W. K. Jackson of Jacksonville, Fla., will go to the Southern Inter-State contest at Lexington, Ky., May 7; and Mr. G. W. Warren of Emory, Va., will participate in the Virginia State contest at Lexington, Va., May 1. At a meeting of the Board of Visitors on April 10 it was decided to enlarge the University law course so that three years will be required for completing it instead of two, as at present. The change is to become effective in September, 1909. Creatore and his band, assisted by Madame Barili, soprano soloist, visited the University on May 4th and gave one of their excellent concerts in Cabell Hall. To have both Sousa and Creatore within the same session is to be unusually fortunate. The former was here in January. Ben Greet and his famous company of English players made their fourth visit to the University on the 9th of this month and presented two of Shakespeare's plays, As You Like It and Much Ado About Nothing. Mr. Greet makes it his purpose to give Shakespeare's plays as nearly as possible like Shakespeare himself wrote them and played them, depending on the intrinsic merit of the drama for interest and effect, rather than upon elaborate and fanciful inventions of the modern stage. Whenever the weather is favorable, and other conditions are inviting, as they are at the University of Virginia, he prefers to give such plays as the two named above out of doors, "under the greenwood trees." To the intelligent student of Shakespeare this adds much that is appropriate and attractive. The faculty of the University Summer School, to be held from June 18 to July 31, is composed of forty-three members, many of whom are among the most experienced and eminent educators of the country. Besides fifteen members of the regular University faculty, the following well-known scholars and teachers have been seeured as instructors and lecturers for the summer session: Dr. John B. Henneman, Professor of English, and Dean of the University of the South; Dr. S. C. Mitchell, Professor of History, Richmond College; and Dr. C. Alphonso Smith, Professor of the English Language and Dean of Graduate School, University of North Carolina. The excellent results of the training given during the present session in the principles and methods of effective public speaking, by Mr. Charles W. Paul, have been repeatedly in evidence in the recent contests in oratory and debate. On April 24 the University dramatic club gave in Cabell Hall their final performance of La Serena, the merry Mexican comedy that has been presented with much success in various cities of the State within the last two or three months. The Y. M. C. A. The following extracts from the annual report of the president of the Young Men's Christian Association, made April 1, will be read with interest. "Up to the present time our membership is 476, which is an increase of 46 over last year. With this large increase in our membreship there has been a corresponding increase in our average attendance at our Wednesday evening meetings. The average attendance up to date this year has been 54, while the average attendance last year was 39. "The committee chairmen will tell you what has been accomplished by the various committees during the present year. Our Bible study department has failed to come up to the higher standard set last year, but we feel that this is largely accounted for by the numerous changes of administration during the year. The present Chairman has accomplished wonders in the short time that he has had charge of the work. Our plan since the first of January has been not so much to gain a large enrollment in Bible classes as it has been to prepare for the work next session by the creating of interest in the work and the training of leaders for the classes. "We feel that the year just closing has been one of distinct advance in Association work here at the University. More and more the Association has identified itself with the various college activities. Men prominent in college life have taken an active part in the Christian work of the Association, and have demonstrated that the principles of the Christian religion can be carried into all college activities and are an absolute necessity for the production of a well-rounded character. "The home of the Association, Madison Hall, has become more and more the acknowledged meeting place, not alone of the Publication Boards and the Athletic Committees but also of musical organizations, state clubs, fraternities, debating teams and other student organizations. The Reading Room has been more largely used than ever before, and the Biblical and Mission Libraries have been in constant service." University Legislation. A recent issue of the Charlottesville Daily Progress contained the following items relating to some changes made by the present Virginia legislature in certain Acts pertaining to the University: "Lewis H. Machen, in his analysis of acts of the assembly, says: Two acts, approved March 13, Acts 1908, pages 378 and 380, which are emergency acts, amend sections 1541 and 1556 of the Code of Virginia, respectively. The first gives to the university, in addition to its other powers, all the corporate powers given to corporations by the provision of chapter 5 of the acts concerning corporations, which became a law on May 21, 1903, except to those cases where, by the express terms of the acts, it is confined to corporations created under it; and the university is also given the power to accept, execute, and administrate any trust in which it may have an interest under the terms of an instrument creating a trust. The provision that the rector and visitors of the university shall be at all times subject to the control of the General Assembly is retained in the new statute. "The second act amends section 1556, so as to make it unlawful for the rector and visitors of the university to issue its obligations to be secured by deeds of trust on its real estate without the consent of the General Assembly. The old law simply provided that they could not contract debts without such consent." The President's house on Carr's Hill is being pushed rapidly toward completion. When finished it will not only afford a beautiful place of residence for the head of the University, but it will also add much to the attractiveness of the locality, which has long been recognized as one of the most desirable in college.

On April 10 the University was favored by a visit from Dr. Robert Irving Fulton, Dean of the College of Oratory in the Ohio Wesleyan University. Dr. Fulton was a student in the law department here in 1877, and came back to Virginia with the true spirit of an alumnus. In the afternoon he gave an address on the art of public speaking, which was heard with enjoyment and profit by a fair-sized audience. At night, when he generously gave an excellent program of unusually good readings for the benefit of the Y. M. C. A., it is to be regretted that the audience was very small. Those present were most profitably entertained, and were ready at the close to second Dr. Alderman's recent statement, that Dr. Fulton is the best exponent of his subject in this country. The annnal election, on May 2, of officers for the General Athletic Association resulted in the choice of the following men: Charles Brown Crawford, of Theological Seminary, Va., president; Mark Roy Faville, Dolgeville, N. Y., vice-president; Charles Francis Cocke, Roanoke, Va., and James Alcorn Rector, Hot Springs, Ark., members of advisory board. The part of the campus adjacent to the northeast wing of the Hospital is being improved by regrading and the construction of much needed walks. As usual, the Easter number of the University Magazine is of special weight and attractiveness. Eight pieces of verse, three stories, a critical essay, and easy chair essay combine with other features to make the reader interested. The University band, announced in the March Record, has made its debut, and is now regarded as an essential factor in college life. On Friday night, May 8, the annual contest of the Central Oratorical League was held in Cabell Hall. Visitors participating represented the University of Chicago, Cornell University, and Ohio Wesleyan University. The University of Virginia was represented by Mr. D. R. Fonville of North Carolina, who tied for first place with Mr. G. G. Bogert of Cornell. Mr. C. A. Bales of Chicago was given second place. Mr. A. C. Schatzman of Columbus, Ohio, represented Ohio Wesleyan University. The orators and their friends were entertained after the contest at a bauquet by the local chapter of the Delta Sigma Rho Society. The Judges, Congressman DeArmond of Missouri, Dean Wilbur and Prof. Vance of George Washington University, Prof. Bowen of Randolph-Macon, and Supt. Fulton of the Miller School, were given a reception by the Colonnade Club. The following items should form a part of the lists of donations given on the first pages of this issue of the Record: From Dr. George Tucker Harrison of New York, 180 volumes, including a set of Buffon's great work, Histoire Naturelle. (1907.) From some Jewish gentlemen of Richmond, at the suggestion of Dr. E. N. Calisch, a set of the Jewish Encyclopedia, 12 volumes. (1908.) From Mr. R. Hall McCormick of Chicago, a portrait of his father, Mr. Leander J. McCormick, for the observatory. From the same, a six-inch refracting telescope for the observatory.</field>
