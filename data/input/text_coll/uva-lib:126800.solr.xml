      <field name="fulltext">INTRODUCTION HISTORICAL SKETCH By an act of the Legislature of Virginia, dated January 12, 1803, certain citizens of Albemarle County were incorporated under the style of "Trustees of Albemarle Academy," and were empowered to take such steps as seemed practicable to raise the funds necessary for erecting buildings and putting the Academy into operation. Albemarle Academy was destined never to exist except on paper, but under the guidance of Thomas Jefferson, who was elected to the board of trustees on March 23, 1814, a process of development was begun leading first to the organization of Central College, and afterwards to that of the University of Virginia. On August 19, 1814, the committee of the trustees appointed to select a site reported that it would be desirable to locate the Academy in the vicinity of the town of Charlottesville, distant not more than half a mile therefrom. By an act of February 14, 1816, the Legislature authorized the establishment of "Central College, in the County of Albemarle, at the place which has been, or shall be, selected by the trustees of Albemarle Academy, and in lieu of such Academy." All rights and claims of Albemarle Academy were, by the same act, vested in Central College. The board of visitors of the College consisted of six members, of whom Jefferson was the only one who had been a member of the Academy board. The other five members were James Madison, James Monroe, Joseph Carrington Cabell, David Watson, and John H. Cocke. On May 5, 1817, Jefferson was elected Rector of the College, and, on the same day, the board authorized the purchase of a farm of about two hundred acres lying one mile west of Charlottesville as a site for the College. This tract now forms a part of the grounds of the University of Virginia. The cornerstone of Central College was laid on October 6, 1817, in the presence of Thomas Jefferson, Rector, and of James Madison and James Monroe âthe latter then President of the United States. This building, located on what is known as the West Lawn of the University, is now utilized as the Colonnade Club. Jefferson's plan was to erect a distinct building, a "pavilion," for each individual professorâthe buildings to be arranged around a rectangular lawn. Each pavilion was to contain "a schoolroom and apartments for the accommodation of the professor," and one-story dormitories for the students were to be erected adjacent to the pavilions. Jefferson drew most of the sketches for the buildings with his own hands, basing them upon designs by Palladio; and his ideas of architectural effect and grouping were carried out in detail when Central College was merged into the University of Virginia. The prime object in Jefferson's mind, while Rector of Central College, was to get the college well under way, and then have it adopted by the Legislature as the State University. Accordingly, in the first report of the visitors to the Legislature, on January 6, 1818, it is recommended that a state university be established on the site of Central College. By an act of February 21, 1818, the Legislature authorized the appointment by the Governor of a board of twenty-four members, to be known as the "Board of Commissioners of the University." It was the duty of this board to meet on HISTORICAL SKETCH August 1, 1818, at the Tavern in Rockfish Gap, on the Blue Ridge Mountains, and report upon the following points regarding the organization of a state university: 1. A proper site for the projected university. 2. A plan for the building thereof. 3. The branches of learning which should be taught therein. 4. The number and description of professorships; and 5. Such general provisions as might properly be enacted by the Legislature for the better organizing and governing of the University. Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe were present at the meeting of the Commissioners, and their able and elaborate report to the Legislature (indicating much careful thought) had probably been prepared by Jefferson before the meeting was held. This report, recommending, among other things, the site of Central College as the most advantageous one for the University, was forwarded in duplicate to the Speaker of the House and the Speaker of the Senate on August 4, 1818. On January 25, 1819, the Legislature adopted a formal act "for establishing an university," and this date must be reckoned as the year of the origin of the University, although the institution was not opened to students until March 7, 1825. Although Jefferson's was the dominant spirit and the shaping hand in the whole movement for the establishment of a state university, it should be stated that but for the influence and efforts of Joseph Carrington Cabell, the close personal friend of Jefferson, the acts of February 21, 1818, and January 25, 1819, would probably have failed of adoption by the Legislature. The act of January 25, 1819, establishing the University, is as follows (Revised Code, 1819, ch. 34, 9.): "1. Be it declared by the General Assembly of Virginia, That the conveyance of the lands and other property appertaining to the Central College in the County of Albemarle, which has been executed by the proctor thereof, under authority of the subscribers and founders, to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund, is hereby accepted, for the use and on the conditions in the said deed of conveyance expressed. "2. And be it enacted, That there shall be established, on the site provided for the said College, an University, to be called the University of Virginia; that it shall be under the government of seven Visitors to be appointed forthwith by the Governor, with the advice of Council, notifying thereof the persons so appointed, and prescribing to them a day for their first meeting at the said University, with supplementary instructions for procuring a meeting subsequently, in the event of failure at the time first appointed. "3. The said Visitors, or so many of them as, being a majority, shall attend, shall appoint a Rector, of their own body, to preside at their meetings, and a secretary to record, attest, and preserve their proceedings, and shall proceed to examine into the state of the property conveyed as aforesaid; shall make an inventory of the same, specifying the items whereof it consists; shall notice the buildings and other improvements already made, and those which are in progress; shall take measures for their completion, and for the addition of such others, from time to time, as may be necessary. "4. In the said University shall be taught the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew languages; French, Spanish, Italian, German, and Anglo-Saxon; the different HISTORICAL SKETCH branches of Mathematics, pure and physical; natural philosophy; the principles of agriculture; chemistry; mineralogy, including geology; botany; zoÃ¶logy; anatomy; medicine; civil government; political economy; the law of nature and nations; municipal law; history; ideology; general grammar, ethics, rhetoric; and belles lettres; which branches of science shall be so distributed, and under so many professors, not exceeding ten, as the Visitors shall think proper and expedient. "5. Each professor shall be allowed the use of the apartments and accommodations provided for him, and those first employed such standing salary as the Visitors shall think proper and sufficient, and their successors such standing salary, not exceeding one thousand dollars, as the Visitors shall think proper and sufficient, with such tuition fees from each student as the Visitors shall from time to time establish. "6. The said Visitors shall be charged with the erection, preservation, and repair of the buildings, the care of the grounds and appurtenances, and of the interests of the University generally; they shall have power to appoint a bursar, employ a proctor, and all other necessary agents; to appoint and remove professors, two-thirds of the whole number of Visitors voting for the removal; to prescribe their duties and the course of education, in conformity with the law; to establish rules for the government and discipline of the students, not contrary to the laws of the land; to regulate tuition fees, and the rent of the dormitories occupied; to prescribe and control the duties and proceedings of all officers, servants, and others, with respect to the buildings, lands, appurtenances, and other property and interests of the University; to draw from the literary fund such monies as are by law charged on it for this institution; and, in general, to direct and do all matters and things which, not being inconsistent with the laws of the land, to them shall seem most expedient for promoting the purposes of said institution; which several functions they shall be free to exercise in the form of by-laws, resolutions, orders, instructions, or otherwise, as they shall deem proper. "7. They shall have two stated meetings in every year, to-wit, on the first Mondays of April and October; and occasional meetings at such other times as they shall appoint, or on a special call, with such notice as themselves shall prescribe by a general rule, which meetings shall be at the University, a majority of them constituting a quorum for business; and on the death, resignation of a member, or failure to act for the space of one year, or on his removal out of the Commonwealth, or by the Governor, with the advice of Council, the Governor with the like advice shall appoint a successor. "8. The said Rector and Visitors shall be a body corporate, under the style and title of `The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia,' with the right, as such, to use a common seal; they shall have capacity to plead and be impleaded in all courts of justice, and in all cases interesting to the University, which may be subjects of legal cognizance and jurisdiction; which pleas shall not abate by the determination of their office, but shall stand revived in the name of their successors; and they shall be capable in law, and in trust for the University, of receiving subscriptions and donations, real and personal, as well from bodies corporate or persons associated, as from private individuals. HISTORICAL SKETCH "9. And the said Rector and Visitors shall, at all times, conform to such laws as the legislature may, from time to time, think proper to enact for their government; and the said University shall in all things, and at all times, be subject to the control of the legislature. And the said Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia shall be, and they are hereby, required to make report annually to the President and Directors of the Literary Fund (to be laid before the legislature at the next succeeding session), embracing a full account of the disbursements, the funds on hand, and a general statement of the condition of said University. "10. The said Board of Visitors, or a majority thereof, by nomination of the Board, shall, once in every year at least, visit the said University; enquire into the proceedings and practices thereat; examine the progress of the students, and give to those who excel in every branch of science there taught, such honorary marks and testimonials of approbation as may encourage and incite to industry and emulation. "11. On every twenty-ninth day of February, or, if that be Sunday, then on the next, or earliest day thereafter on which a meeting can be effected, the Governor and Council shall be in session, and shall appoint Visitors of the said University, either the same or others at their discretion, to serve until the twenty-ninth day of February next ensuing, duly and timely notifying to them their appointment and prescribing a day for their first meeting at the University; after which, their meetings, stated and occasional, shall be as hereinbefore provided: Provided, that nothing in this act contained shall suspend the proceedings of the Visitors of the said Central College of Albemarle; but for the purpose of expediting any objects of said institution, they shall be authorized, under the control of the Governor and Council, to continue the exercise of their functions, and fulfill those of their successors, until the first actual meeting of their said successors. "12. And be it further enacted, That the additional sum of twenty thousand dollars shall be, and the same is hereby, appropriated to the education of the poor, out of the revenue of the Literary Fund, in the aid of the sum heretofore appropriated to that object, and to be paid in the same manner and upon the same conditions in all respects as is prescribed by the fourth section of the act entitled `An act appropriating part of the revenue of the Literary Fund, and for other purposes, passed the twenty-first day of February, eighteen hundred and eighteen.' "13. This act shall commence and be in force from and after the passing thereof." The first Board of Visitors consisted of four members of the board of Central Collegeânamely, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Joseph Carrington Cabell, and John H. Cocke; the additional appointees were James Breckenridge, Chapman Johnson, and Robert Taylor. The Board met for the first time on March 29, 1819, and elected Thomas Jefferson rector. Henceforth, until his death in 1826, Jefferson was the dominating and directing power of the University, not only evolving the entire system of education introduced, but actually devising, to the minutest detail, every feature of construction and administration. HISTORICAL SKETCH The organization of the University, its government, discipline, and methods of instruction, were virtually prescribed by Jefferson alone; and in many respects they still retain the impression derived from him. By virtue of its charter, the supreme government of the institution, under the General Assembly, is vested in the Rector and Visitors. Under the general direction of this Board, and subject to its regulations, the affairs of the University were administered, for the first eighty years of its existence, by the Faculty and its Chairman, the latter being a member of the Faculty, who occupied temporarily the position of chief executive officer of the institution. As the University grew, it became more and more difficult for a member of the teaching staff to fill the position of Chairman, and attend to the manifold executive duties attached to that office. In October, 1903, the Visitors decided that modern conditions rendered necessary the creation of the office of president; and in June, 1904, Edwin Anderson Alderman was elected first president of the University of Virginia. The scheme of instruction organized by Jefferson contemplated no fixed uniform curriculum of studies to be pursued by every student alike, without discrimination. Each distinct branch of knowledge was, as far as was practicable assigned to an individual "School" with its own instructors; and the University was to consist of a collection of independent Schools. The origin of the elective system at the University of Virginia is found in the fact that students were permitted to matriculate in any School or Schools of the University for which they were prepared. The wisdom of the Founder in establishing such a system has been amply vindicated in the history of this University and in the adoption by almost all schools of higher education in the country of methods involving this principle. The original organization embraced eight independent Schoolsânamely, Ancient Languages, Modern Languages, Mathematics, Natural Philosophy, Moral Philosophy, Chemistry, Medicine, and Law. The first seven Schools mentioned were opened to matriculates on March 7, 1825, with an aggregate attendance, during the first session, of 123 students. The School of Law was not opened until 1826. This original organization was gradually enlarged and modified. As early as 1837 the School of Medicine was elevated to a Department, consisting of three individual Schools; while in 1850 the School of Law was enlarged to a Department consisting of two Schools. Other Departments and Schools have been added from time to time. A most notable addition was made in May, 1909, when, through a gift from Mr. Andrew Carnegie to the General Alumni Association, six new Schools were established by joint action of the Rector and Visitors and the Alumni Board of Trustees of the University of Virginia Endowment Fund: The Andrew Carnegie School of Engineering, The James Madison School of Law, The James Monroe School of International Law, The James Wilson School of Political Economy, The Edgar Allan Poe School of English, The Walter Reed School of Pathology. In April, 1919, was founded through the generous gift of Mr. Paul Goodloe McIntire, the McIntire School of Fine Arts, embracing instruction in Art, Architecture and Music. It was provided by the first Board of Visitors, in accordance with Jefferson's wishes, that but two degrees should be conferred by the University. The lower THE HONOR SYSTEM degree, characteristic of the institution for many years, was conferred upon a student who had completed all the work offered in any one School; to such a candidate the untitled degree of "Graduate" in the School in question should be given. The other, the higher degree, was to be the Doctor's degree and was to be given to the graduate in two or more Schools who had, in addition, exhibited well-developed powers of research. There is abundant evidence that, in planning the organization of the University of Virginia, Thomas Jefferson had in mind the so-called continental type of university. The first faculty were, however, with one or two exceptions, Oxford or Cambridge men. Naturally they had in mind the English type of university, and the result was that in 1831 the faculty substituted for the Doctor's degree proposed by Jefferson, the Master's degree, common in England. The degree of "Master of Arts of the University of Virginia" was accordingly, for more than half a century, the leading degree conferred by this institution. THE HONOR SYSTEM For eighteen years after the opening of the institution, written examinations were conducted under the surveillance of a committee of three professors. This was not altogether satisfactory, and in June, 1842, Judge Henry St. George Tucker, Professor of Law, offered the following resolution, which the Faculty at once adopted: Resolved, That in all future written examinations for distinction and other honors of the University, each candidate shall attach to the written answers presented by him on such examination a certificate in the following words: "I, A. B., do hereby certify, on honor, that I have derived no assistance during the time of this examination from any source whatever, whether oral, written, or in print, in giving the above answers." This was the beginning of the Honor System at this institution, and it has been in operation ever since without interruption. Later the pledge was extended so as to preclude the giving as well as the receiving of assistance. Still more recently the scope of the Honor System has been enlarged so as to cover other phases of student conduct. Its administration is entirely in the hands of the students, the essence of the system being that the violation of a student's word of honor is an offense not against the University authorities, but against the whole student body, and on the rare occasions on which it has occurred, the students themselves have quietly and promptly sent the offender away from the University without need of faculty action. Examinations are required to be held in one place and in the presence of the professor in charge of the course or one of his assistants. These regulations in no way conflict with the spirit of the Honor System, but are regarded as being necessary to give a proper dignity and formality to the occasion.</field>

      <field name="fulltext">ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS For admission to any department of the University, the general conditions are the following. 1. Sufficient Age.âThe minimum legal age is sixteen years. 2. Good Character.âThis must be attested by a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended, or by other valid proof. 3. Adequate Preparation.âThis must be such as will enable the candidate to meet the requirements for admission to the several departments of the University, as detailed below. For admission to the Department of Graduate Studies, see page 271. For admission to the Department of Law, see page 350. For admission to the Department of Medicine, see page 362. For admission to the Department of Education, see page 286. For admission to the College of Arts and Sciences, or the Department of Engineering, the candidate must present a certificate or pass an equivalent examination. In either case the amount of preparation required is measured in terms of units. A unit represents a year's study in any subject in a secondary school, constituting approximately a quarter of a full year's work. This definition of a unit takes the four-year high-school course as a basis and assumes that the length of the school year is from thirty-six to forty weeks, that a period is from forty to sixty minutes in length, and that the study is pursued for four or five periods a week; but under ordinary circumstances a satisfactory year's work in any subject cannot be accomplished in less than one hundred and twenty hours, or their equivalent. For the requirements as to the number and selection of the units required for entrance, see, for the College of Arts and Sciences, page 255; for the Department of Engineering, page 302. Admission of Women.âThe admission of women to the several departments of the University is subject to the following conditions: 1. General Requirements: The applicant must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present a certificate showing graduation from an accredited public high school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private-school, with credit for not less than 15 college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for 15 entrance units, of at least 30 session-hours (60 semester-hours), of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. 2.

The candidate for admission from a public high school must be a full graduate of an accredited four-year high school. The candidate for admission from a private secondary school must be a full graduate of the school, or must present a certificate showing that he has completed at least the equivalent of four years of satisfactory secondary school work of standard grade, covering at least 15 entrance units. Certificate credit for any entrance unit is invalidated by subsequent failure in a college entrance examination on the unit in question, unless the applicant ranked in the highest quarter of his class. An applicant for admission who ranked in the lowest quarter of his class, or who failed on more than two subjects in secondary school, will not be admitted unless he presents positive evidence that he is likely to succeed in college in spite of his secondary school record. An applicant for admission from outside of Virginia may be required to supplement his application by an interview with a representative of the University. In every case the applicant must have a general character recommendation from the principal of his school, and personality and promise, as well as scholarly attainment, will be considered in determining admission. The University accredits all four-year public high schools and all private secondary schools which are fully accredited by the State Board of Education of Virginia. Schools outside of Virginia which are fully accredited by their own state universities or institutions of equal rank, by their own state departments of education or by recognized regional associations of secondary schools, are also accredited by the University. Certificates of preparation from private tutors will in no case be accepted; students thus prepared must in all cases pass the entrance examinations. ADMISSION BY EXAMINATION For admission by examination, the candidate must present himself at the University in June or in September, according to the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. The examinations are held under the Honor System, no paper being accepted unless accompanied by the usual pledge, and they are held only on the dates given in the Program of Entrance Examinations. A fee of one dollar is charged for each examination taken. This fee is payable in advance and is in no case returned. The entrance examinations of the University are similar, in many respects, to those of the College Entrance Examination Board. The University does not furnish sample copies of its entrance examinations. Official records of the examinations of the College Entrance Examination Board or of the University of the State of New York may be submitted in lieu of taking entrance examinations here.

Delayed Registration.âAny student who fails to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session will not be admitted unless he can explain his delay in a manner satisfactory to the President, and will be charged a delayed registration fee. Admission to the College of Arts and Sciences during the Session.âNo applicant for admission to the College of Arts and Sciences who has not been previously registered therein will be admitted after October 1, unless the Committee on Admissions is satisfied that, in view of his record, he is likely to prove successful with the work undertaken in spite of the handicap of late entrance. Registration after the Christmas Recess.âOn the first week-day after the Christmas Recess, every student is required to register by attending all the classes or laboratory exercises at which he is due that day. No further formality is necessary. Any student failing to register thus will be required to pay the delayed registration fee, and will be liable to penalties imposed for unexcused absences. But if the delay is due to illness or other providential cause the Dean is authorized to remit the fee. RESIDENCE AND ATTENDANCE The Academic Year begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September and continues for thirty-nine weeks. Thanksgiving Day and Jefferson Day are holidays, and there is a Christmas recess beginning on the last week-day before the twenty-third of December and closing on the evening of the second of January. Attendance is required of each student throughout the entire session, with the exception of holidays, unless he receives permission to be temporarily absent, or to withdraw before the close of the session. While in residence each student is required to attend regularly all lectures and other prescribed exercises in the courses which he pursues, or else suffer such penalties as may be imposed for unexcused absences. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University and the Dean of the department in which the student is registered. For the conditions governing the return of fees upon withdrawal, see page 159. Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted by the several departmental faculties for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness or any other fault which REGULATIONS prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also the regulations as to delinquent students in the various departments. Absence from Examinations.âWritten examinations are an essential part of the work of every course in the University, and attendance upon them is required of every student. Absence may be excused only on the ground of sickness on the day of examination (attested by a physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause which may be approved by the several faculties of the University. Special Examinations are granted only upon prompt application therefor, and in case the applicant's absence from the regular examination has been excused. See the preceding paragraphs. Honor System.âAll examinations are held under the Honor System, and an unpledged paper is counted a total failure. In matters of class standing as well, students are expected to regard themselves as governed by the law of honor. CONDUCT The laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the University precincts or anywhere else. Drunkenness, gambling and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President may dismiss from the University any student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. The President will dismiss from the University every student convicted of public drunkenness, or of other conduct reflecting serious discredit upon the University. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the University grounds is forbidden. Motor driven vehicles either owned or operated by students are prohibited from parking in the roadways and alleys of the University grounds between the hours of 8:30 a. m. and 4:30 p. m. However, students suffering from serious physical disability, or who live more than two miles outside the city limits, may be granted permits to park. Prohibition of Credit.âAn act of the Legislature prohibits merchants and others, under severe penalties, from crediting minor students. The license to contract debts, which the President is authorized to grant, is limited (except when the parent or guardian requests otherwise in writing) to cases of urgent necessity. DORMITORIES AND BOARD Dormitories.âStudents may reside in the University dormitories, in their homes, or in private houses approved by the President. The President will REGULATIONS withdraw from the approved list any house in which the regulations as to the conduct of students are not observed. Any change of residence during the session should be reported at the office of the Registrar. For rules governing the rental and occupancy of University dormitories, and the rates charged for the same, see page 161. For list of private lodging houses, with rates, apply to the Bursar.

MEDICAL ATTENDANCE Medical Attendance.âAny student who is temporarily ill from causes not due to his own misconduct, is entitled, without charge, to all necessary medical advice from the University Physician; and, if necessary, to nursing in the University Hospital at a reasonable charge for his maintenance while there. This exemption from charge does not apply to cases requiring surgical operation, treatment of the eye, ear, nose and throat, or to constitutional disorders from which the student in question was suffering at the time of his coming to the University. Nor is the University responsible for the expense incurred through the employment of private nurses, necessitated by severe illness of students, or through the maintenance of quarantine precautions in contagious cases. Students who take the responsibility of boarding at houses not approved by the Board of Health forfeit the right of medical attendance. Any student sent to the University Hospital by the advice and under the care of a physician other than the University Physician will be required to pay the regular hospital charges for private patients. EXPENSES Payment of Fees.âWhen the aggregate charge for University fee, tuition fee, laboratory fees and room rent does not exceed $50 for the session, the total amount shall be paid upon registration. If said fees aggregate more than $50, but do not exceed $100, one-half thereof shall be paid upon registration and the remainder at the beginning of the second term. When the fees aggregate more than $100, payment shall be made one-third upon registration; one-third at the opening of the second term and the remainder at the opening of the third term. If any payment remain unpaid for fifteen days after the date on which it is due, the Bursar shall immediately notify the Dean of the department in which such student is entered of the delinquency, and such student shall by him be required at once to cease attending lectures, using laboratories, library, gymnasium, athletic grounds or buildings, boarding at the dining hall, and making use of any other privileges as a student until his financial relations with the University have been arranged satisfactorily with the Bursar. REGULATIONS The above regulation will also apply in the case of any student who owes a fine to the University Library and who permits the fine to remain unpaid for fifteen days. Return of Fees.âA student withdrawing within five days after registering shall have his fees refunded in full, except the sum of $5 to cover cost of registration, and his name shall be stricken from the rolls. If he withdraw or is dropped from the rolls for any cause after the fifth day of the term and before the middle thereof, his fees shall be returned pro rata. If he withdraw or be dropped from the rolls for any cause after the middle of any term no refund shall be made for that term, except in case of sickness when the refund shall be pro-rated upon certificate of the University Physician or other reputable medical practitioner. In any case a minimum charge of $5 shall be made to cover cost of registration. Laboratory fees shall be refunded upon statement of professor in charge except where the withdrawal is within five days after registering. Regulation Concerning Registration as Virginia Student.âIn order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; or if he has attained his majority, that he himself be domiciled in said State; and that either his parents or the applicant for admission shall have bona fide taxpayers in the State of Virginia for at least two years prior to said application. Sons of Regular Officers of the United States Army or Navy, whether on the active or retired list, irrespective of the location of their posts of duty, are accorded the privilege of registering under the rules applicable to the registration of Virginia students.

BOARD AND LODGING The University Dormitories The dormitories of the University of Virginia consist of The Halls, East Lawn and West Lawn, East Range and West Range, Dawson's Row, and Randall Building. Hot water heat and electric light are furnished throughout the dormitories. Each occupant of a dormitory room must provide a pillow, pillow cases, single sheets, blankets, towels, etc., and whatever rugs, curtains, etc., he may desire. Description and Rates The Halls.âThe most comfortable, best-equipped, and most modern rooming accommodations in the University or in the city are to be found in the EXPENSES new University dormitories, erected in 1929. This group of eight buildings stands on the crest of the slope west of Monroe Hill, with an outlook on the Ragged Mountains and the range of the Blue Ridge, and is within less than three minutes walking distance from the gymnasium, the academic, engineering and law class-rooms, and the University Commons. These eight buildings are divided into twelve separate units, known as Halls, each with its individual entrance, and each bearing the name of some professor, distinguished in the history of the University. The buildings are of three stories and of full fire-proof brick and cement construction throughout. They provide one hundred and fifty-three two-room apartments, of living-room and bedroom, each apartment intended to accommodate two students. All of the rooms are approximately fifteen feet square. Each living-room has an open fire-place and is furnished with a desk with drawers, a table with drawer, a steel waste-basket, two rocking-chairs, two straight chairs and floorplugs for reading lamps. Each bedroom has two large built-in clothes closets, and is furnished with two single steel beds, two chiffoniers, and two straight chairs. All furniture is new, of excellent quality and attractive design, the bedsprings and mattresses of especially high grade. There is an average of one bathroom to every five students. The bathrooms, each equipped with showers and an individual built-in steel locker and a medicine chest with mirror for each student using it, are so placed that every bed-room, with one sole exception, opens directly into a bath. Telephone service is provided in each Hall. Trunks and packing cases will not be permitted in the apartments of The Halls dormitories. They must be delivered to the trunk room in each Hall from which the student will remove the contents to his room. Trunks and packing cases will be stored in dry racks located in the basement. Each apartment will ordinarily be occupied by two students. The rental for the nine months of the regular session is $150 per student (or $300 for each apartment). East Lawn and West Lawn are of one-story brick construction. They contain thirty-eight rooms, each approximately twelve feet square, located between the pavilions and opening into colonnades running the entire length of "The Lawn." The rental of twenty-seven of the rooms, for the session, is $125 for one occupant or $170 for two occupants. The remaining nine rooms, called Bachelors' Row, rent for $115 for one occupant, or $160 for two occupants. These rooms are reserved for applicants for senior degrees. East Range and West Range consist of forty-six one-story brick rooms, approximately twelve feet square, built in sections running the entire length of "The Ranges," and opening into arcades. In addition, there are two two-story brick houses called the Old Gymnasium and the Club House, containing fourteen rooms, approximately fifteen feet square. The rental of the rooms on the Ranges, for the session, is $125 for one occupant or $170 for two. The rooms in the Old Gymnasium and the Club House rent for $80 for one occupant or $110 for two. EXPENSES Dawson's Row consists of a series of four eight-room two-story brick houses, and a six-room one-story brick house, located on the southwest side of the grounds. The rooms are approximately fifteen feet square. The rental of fifty-one of the rooms, for the session, is $95 for one occupant or $130 for two. Four of the rooms rent for $60 for one occupant or $80 for two. All of the rooms on the Lawns and Ranges and in Dawson's Row are provided with running cold water. For each of the Lawns and Ranges one bathhouse is provided and there is a bath-house in Dawson's Row. Randall Building.âA two-story brick building, located at the south end of East Range, containing thirty-one single rooms ten by fourteen, ten by fifteen and ten by sixteen; eight double rooms fourteen by fifteen, fifteen by fifteen and fifteen by seventeen; one double room with study-room attached. Single rooms rent at $80 to $90; double rooms $125 for one occupant or $150 for two occupants. Double room with study-room attached, for one occupant $135, or $180 for two occupants. The furnishing of the rooms on the Lawns and Ranges, in Dawson's Row and Randall Building is as follows: For one occupantâan enamelled iron bed with comfortable springs and mattress, a chiffonier, a table, a straight chair and a rocking-chair. For two occupantsâtwo single beds or one double-deck bed with springs and mattresses, one chiffonier, one desk or two tables, one rocking-chair and two straight chairs. Board Meals may be obtained at the University Commons, which is a handsome building overlooking the McIntire Theatre and situated within two minutes' walk of any of the dormitories. The interior of the main dining-room is panelled, and the walls contain portraits of a number of distinguished alumni and officers of the University. The furnishings are attractive. The capacity of the Commons is three hundred. Board is furnished at cost and in no case will exceed $35 per month. Other Accommodations In addition to the University Dormitories and the Commons, there are private lodging and boarding houses situated near the University, and a number of restaurants are nearby. A list of these will be furnished upon application. Occupants of the dormitories may take their meals either at the Commons or elsewhere. All inquiries concerning rooms or board should be addressed to The Bursar, University, Virginia. APPROXIMATE SUMMARY OF NECESSARY EXPENSES The figures in the following tables may be taken as fairly accurate approximations of all necessary expenses for a session of nine months. As necessary expenses are reckoned here University, tuition, and athletic fees, laboratory fees, lodging, board, laundry, and books, but not clothing, traveling expenses, or pocket money. For each department three estimates are givenâa low, an average, EXPENSES and a liberal estimate. The difference in the three depends on the difference of expenditure for board, lodging, books, and laundryâin other words, on the scale of living of the individual student. If a student shares a room with another student, and practices the strictest economy, he may possibly reduce his expenses below the estimate.

Opportunities for employment are not infrequent, but no new student should attempt to attend the University unless he has sufficient private resources to defray at least half of the expenses of his first session. After a student has arrived at the University, the Bureau will make every effort to find suitable work for him, but no assurance of employment can be given until after the student's arrival. Students who desire the assistance of the Bureau are invited to apply for information by addressing the Director, Box 1487, University, Virginia. Loans will be provided for deserving students.

A candidate of average ability and good training may absolve the requisite number of courses within one year after the baccalaureate degree. The final oral examination, however, embraces questions asked and answered in two Romanic languages; and the candidate whose collegiate work represents one Romanic language only will find it difficult to acquire in one year the supplementary language and absolve other requirements. Further, the thesis must incorporate the results (elementary, at least) of original investigation on the part of the candidate; and unless he already have at the outset, or find very quickly, a promising subject of investigation, nine months will prove insufficient for the work.

In addition to this systematic portion of the course an attempt is made to acquaint the students with fresh tissues and disease as seen at the autopsy table. With this end in view the class is divided into small groups of students each of which assists at a limited number of autopsies. Fresh tissues are demonstrated during class hours and, whenever possible, autopsies are performed before the entire class. Dr. Cash, Dr. Kang and Dr. Scherer.

      <field name="fulltext">COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES THE COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES JOHN LLOYD NEWCOMB, B.A., C.E. Acting President of the University JAMES MORRIS PAGE, M.A., Ph.D., LL.D. Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences GEORGE OSCAR FERGUSON, Jr., M.A., Ph.D. Assistant Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Admission from Secondary School as a Regular Student: The general requirements for admission to the University may be found on page 152. For admission to the College of Arts and Sciences as a regular student, the candidate must possess an amount of preparation which is at least the equivalent of that represented by four years of successful work in an accredited school. He must offer, either by certificate or by examination (see page 153), 15 units, of which 3 must be in English and 2Â½ in Mathematics (1Â½ in Algebra, 1 in Plane Geometry). The remaining 9Â½ units may be selected at will from the list on page 153, but no credit will be given for less than 2 units in any foreign language. For admission to the course leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Architecture, Solid Geometry and secondary school Physics are required. Students who desire to study architecture but who cannot offer Solid Geometry and Physics for admission, are advised to enter the regular college course and to include these subjects in their program of studies. Candidates for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Chemistry should offer Inorganic Chemistry and Solid Geometry. Admission from Other Colleges.âAn applicant for admission to the College of this University from an institution of collegiate rank may be admitted upon presentation of a satisfactory transcript of his record at his former college (see page 154). No student suspended from another college for scholastic deficiency or on probation in another college for scholastic deficiency will be admitted to the College of this University in the immediately succeeding session, unless he passes on at least 3 session-hours of work in one term of the Summer Quarter of this University. No student from another college will be admitted to the College of this University if he has ever been suspended or on probation more than once, or if he has ever been both on probation and suspended. Advanced Standing is given to any candidate who, in addition to meeting the minimum requirements for entrance above stated, can show by passing an examination given sometime during the first month of his first session that he has done work equivalent to that covered by any of the following COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES courses offered in the college: Latin A1, Greek A1, Greek A2, English A1, Mathematics A1, German A1, French A1, Spanish A1, Italian A1, History A1, Music A1. Candidates who apply for examination for advanced standing must present a special certificate showing that the full content of the course, on which advanced standing is sought, has been covered in a systematic manner in the preparatory school, and in addition must present the specific recommendation of the principal of the school that the candidate be admitted to the advanced standing examination in question. College Credit.âCandidates who desire credit for work done at other colleges, must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students, and must, in addition, file with the Dean a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college, must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate, and must give his grades. The final validation of those certificates which are provisionally accepted is effected by the successful completion of not less than 12 session-hours of work during the first session. In no case will credit be given for more than 45 session-hours of work done elsewhere, and any candidate who receives this maximum amount of credit can count among the remaining 15 session-hours required for his degree only the credit value of the courses he has passed as a resident student in the College of Arts and Sciences, exclusive of any credit for work done in the Summer Quarter or in any of the professional departments. In every case the candidate must spend the last session of his candidacy, which must be a regular session of nine months, exclusively in college work in this University; and the courses offered as Major Electives must all be completed in residence in this University. A maximum of 15 session-hours may be granted for one year of college work, and 33 hours for two years. In general credit will not be granted for work completed elsewhere with the lowest passing grade, if the grades are given as letters, or with a grade below 75 per cent., if the grades are given as percentages. Conditioned Students.âA candidate for admission must offer 15 units as defined by the Southern Commission on Accredited Schools. At least 13 of the units offered must be included in the list of units accepted for admission on page 153. A student who, while able to offer 15 units, either cannot offer 15 units as defined in this list, or cannot offer the 5Â½ required units mentioned on page 253, may be conditioned on any 2 units not including English A, B, or C, or Mathematics A1. All conditions should be absolved before the beginning of the session following initial registration. This may be done by passing entrance examinations or by passing equivalent courses in the Summer Quarter. But no course taken to remove a condition may be counted as part of the work credited toward a degree. No conditioned student may be awarded a degree until his entrance conditions are absolved, nor may he be later registered as a special student. Special Students.âA candidate may be admitted as a special student without fulfilling the entrance requirements above specified, provided that, if he is a Virginian, he is more than twenty years old, or, if he is not a Virginian, COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES he is more than twenty-three years old, on the day of registration, and gives adequate evidence of serious purpose and of the training needed to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up their deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the Summer Quarter. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for degrees, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. An applicant who has regularly attended a secondary school until he is twenty years of age without, because of failure, obtaining credit for 15 acceptable entrance units, will not be admitted as a special student. Admission of Women.âWomen are admitted as candidates for the vocational degrees of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, Bachelor of Science in Architecture and Bachelor of Science in Commerce. A candidate must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present a certificate showing graduation from an accredited public high school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private school, with credit for not less than 15 college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for 15 entrance units, of at least 30 session-hours (60 semester-hours), of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. Admission during the Session.âStudents are rarely admitted later than the beginning of the session. A few, of exceptional preparation and ability, may be admitted at the beginning of the second term, early in January. No students are admitted in February. REGULATIONS (1) The Session-Hour.âAll courses are measured in terms of the session-hour as a unit. A session-hour is one hour a week throughout the session of lecture or recitation, or two hours a week throughout the session of laboratory work. (2) Maximum and Minimum Number of Session-Hours.âEach college student is required to undertake each session courses aggregating at least 15 session-hours (with the exception noted under Probation below). This number may be increased in the following cases: (I) Any first-year student may take 18 session-hours, provided he is credited with 6 session-hours of advanced standing. (II) A student not in his first year in the College of Arts and Sciences may take 18 session-hours, provided he (a) has passed in the preceding session or in the third term thereof courses aggregating 15 session-hours, or (b) is in his graduating year and needs 18 session-hours for his degree. (III) A student not in his first year may take 21 session-hours provided he passed in the preceding session or in the third term thereof courses aggregating 18 session-hours. (IV) Any student whose term grade (or class grade, if the term grade is not available) for the first or second term is at least 75 per cent. in each of his courses, may take 3 additional session-hours for the ensuing term. COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES Physical Education is not counted in the maximum and minimum requirements detailed above. Exceptions to the above regulations will be allowed only by special permission of the Committee on Rules and Courses. (3) Grade.âThe grade of a college student in any course either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Class standing in any course is determined by the regularity of the student's attendance upon the lectures (and laboratory or other similar exercises) of the course, and by the quality of his work, as indicated by his recitation grades, written tests, laboratory work, etc. For passing in any course in the college a grade of 75 per cent. is required. (4) Exclusion from Courses, Probation and Suspension: (I) Exclusion from Courses: 1. A student who is evidently making no real progress in a course, may, at any time during the session, be excluded from the course by the Dean upon recommendation of the instructor concerned. 2. A student whose term grade in a course is less than 50 per cent., or who discontinues the course without permission of the Dean, or who is absent without excuse from the term examination, will be excluded from the course. (II) Probation and Suspension: 1. Probation is a state of warning, involving withdrawal from the student of certain privileges enumerated below. Suspension means enforced withdrawal from the College. 2. A student will be placed on probation if, in any term, he does not pass on 6 hours of work; and, if he shall be excluded from a course or courses, he must, in order to avoid probation, pass on a number of hours 6 in excess of the number from which he is excluded. A student will be suspended if, in any term, he does not pass on 3 hours of work; and, if he shall be excluded from a course or courses, he must, in order to escape suspension, pass on a number of hours 3 in excess of the number from which he is excluded. 3. A student on probation must carry at least 12 hours of work or be suspended. A student not on probation must carry at least 15 hours of work or be placed on probation. 4. No student may remain on probation for more than two terms in his entire college course. If his record is such as to invoke probation a third time, he will be suspended. No student suspended a second time may reenter the College. 5. No student on probation may be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as an athletic team, a musical club or a student publication. 6. Suspension, if imposed during the session, applies to the remainder of the regular session; if imposed at the end of the session, it applies to the whole of the subsequent session. COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES 7. Probation or suspension may be absolved by the completion of 3 session-hours of work in one term of the Summer Quarter. 8. A student who is permitted to withdraw from the University during the session will be re-admitted only on probation if, at the time of his withdrawal, he was on probation. A student previously suspended will be readmitted only on probation. 9. The application of these regulations is automatic. A student may, however, appeal in writing to the Committee on Rules and Courses for relief from their application. The Committee is empowered to grant relief for just cause. (5) Absence from Examinations will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. A student excused from more than one-half of his term examinations on account of illness may not be a member of any student organization which publicly represents the University, such as an athletic team, a musical club, or a student publication, until he has taken his examinations. No student may remain in the College if he misses all the examinations of two consecutive terms on account of illness. (6) Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination is excused, in accordance with (5) above, is entitled to a special examination on a date during the regular session to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge of the examinations. (7) Re-Examinations.âA candidate for an academic degree who fails on only one of his courses during his final session of candidacy is entitled to a special re-examination on the work of that course before the final day, provided that he average at least 65 per cent. on the work of the three terms, and provided the professor in charge recommends that the candidate be granted a re-examination. The professor in charge is to decide whether the candidate is to stand a re-examination upon the whole course, or upon some portion or portions of the course. No fee is charged for such re-examination. It should be carefully noted that no student is entitled to more than one re-examination on a given course without repeating the course. (8) Reports.âReports are sent at the end of each term to the parent or guardian of each College student. These reports indicate the number of times the student has been absent from lectures, and give his term grade on each course. The Dean will at any time furnish to the proper person a special report on any student's standing. In addition to the above, a report on the standing of each first-year student in the College is sent to the student's parent or guardian early in November. (9) Conduct.âThe laws of the University require from every student decorous, sober, and upright conduct as long as he remains a member of the University, whether he be within the precincts or anywhere else. Drunkenness, gambling, and dissoluteness are strictly forbidden, and the President COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES may dismiss from the University for the residue of the current session every student found guilty of them, or may administer such other discipline as seems best under the circumstances. The President will dismiss from the University every student convicted of public drunkenness, or of other conduct reflecting serious discredit upon the University. In all cases of discipline, the law requires that the student must first be informed of the objections to his conduct and afforded an opportunity of explanation and defense. The keeping of dogs by students within the University grounds is forbidden. Motor driven vehicles either owned or operated by students are prohibited from parking in the roadways and alleys of the University grounds between the hours of 8:30 a. m. and 4:30 p. m. However, students suffering from serious physical disability, or who live more than two miles outside the city limits, may be granted permits to park. (10) Voluntary Withdrawal.âVoluntary withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University as well as the consent of the student's parent or guardian, if he is a minor. Any student who withdraws without permission will be recorded as having been suspended for the residue of the current session. No student on probation may withdraw except for imperative reasons and any student on probation who withdraws without permission will be suspended, not only for the residue of the current session, but also for the whole of the subsequent session. (11) Enforced Withdrawal is inflicted for habitual delinquency in class, habitual idleness, or any other fault which prevents the student from fulfilling the purposes for which he should have come to the University. See also Suspension, above. (12) Change of Studies.âNo change can be made in a student's program of studies except with the written consent of the Dean, together with official notification by the Registrar. No permit for change of courses will be issued after the end of the first week of each term. Any student who drops a course without permission will receive a grade of zero in that course; and no credit may be received for any portion of a course attended before formal permission has been granted as outlined above. (13) Absence from Lectures may be excused by the Dean, but only for sickness or other imperative cause. Any explanation of an absence which a student has to offer must be made in writing to the Dean within one week after the absence. But no excuse for an absence may be submitted after the beginning of an examination period. Any student not on probation is allowed 2 absences without penalty each term in each course, and a student who passed, in the preceding term, on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 15 term-hours, is allowed 4 absences without penalty each term in each course. But the performance of written work and laboratory work is not affected by the allowance of absences without penalty. COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES Each unexcused absence (in excess of absences without penalty) from a class exercise in any term will cause one point to be deducted from the student's term grade. A total of more than 10 unexcused absences (in excess of absences without penalty) in any term will cause a student to be placed on probation. Probation imposed for absences is called "attendance probation," and it carries the penalties of probation imposed for failure in courses. If a student incurs attendance probation while on probation for failure in courses he will be suspended. No student who was, for any reason, absent from more than 50 per cent. of the lectures of a course in any term can receive a grade on the course in that term. This regulation does not apply to students on the Dean's List or to holders of Intermediate Honors. The laws relating to absence from the University of members of athletic teams are found in the General Catalogue. The same regulations apply, mutatis mutandis, to members of other student organizations. (14) The Dean's List.âAny student who passed, in the preceding term, on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 15 term-hours, with an average grade on all courses of at least 85 per cent., will be placed on the Dean's List. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting absence from classes, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone. But the performance of written work and laboratory work is not affected by these regulations. (15) Physical Education Requirement.âAll first- and second-year students in the College of Arts and Sciences are required to take the course in Physical Education unless excused by the Dean. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES Full opportunity is given to any student to carry out any definite plan of work which he may have in view on coming to the University, or which may have been prescribed for him by those under whose direction he is completing his education. But when no well-considered plan has been outlined in advance, and the end in view is that for which the great majority of students should enter college, namely, the attainment of a liberal education, the student will be expected to enter upon regular work of the college leading to a baccalaureate degree. Five degrees are offered candidates for graduation in the College of Arts and Sciences. Two of these, the Bachelor of Arts and the Bachelor of Science, are cultural; the Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed on the diploma, the Bachelor of Science in Architecture, and the Bachelor of Science in Commerce, are vocational degrees, designed for those who wish to fit themselves especially for professional work. No course offered by a successful candidate for one of the cultural baccalaureate degrees can be offered by the same candidate as part of the work credited toward the other cultural baccalaureate degree, nor can any course which COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES has been counted as credit toward a vocational degree be subsequently counted as credit toward a cultural degree; and no work done to remove an entrance condition can be counted for any degree. For a student who enters without advanced standing the normal time required for obtaining a baccalaureate degree is four years, assuming that he completes each year courses which aggregate the regular minimum of 15 session-hours. A student receiving advanced standing in not less than two subjects may obtain a degree in three years, provided he is able to complete each year 18 session-hours. A student may materially shorten the time required for obtaining a degree by taking courses in the Summer Quarter for which college credit is given. For credit for work done at other colleges, see page 256. The requirements for the baccalaureate degrees are such as to allow a large measure of freedom of election on the part of the individual student, such restriction only being placed upon this liberty as is necessary to insure at the same time the thoroughness and the breadth of culture for which these degrees stand. In order to secure to the recipient of a degree a due measure of acquaintance with the methods of thought characteristic of each of the leading departments of knowledge, as well as with their subject matter, his courses must be chosen subject to the specific requirements detailed below. BACHELOR OF ARTS AND BACHELOR OF SCIENCE The degree of Bachelor of Arts or of Bachelor of Science, respectively, will be conferred upon regular students who have completed not less than 60 session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the following program: (1) Required Subjects.âCandidates for either cultural degree must take 33 hours of required subjects as stated below and must in addition, unless exemption is granted on a physician's certificate, complete the two years' course in Physical Education which is not evaluated in session-hours (see below). Of the 33 hours of required subjects not less than 24 hours must be taken during the first two years, and the remaining 9 hours not later than the third year. Foreign Languages For the Bachelor of Arts.â9 session-hours from two languages, of which 6 must be in either Latin or Greek. For the Bachelor of Science.â9 session-hours from two languages, of which 6 must be in either French, German, Spanish, or Italian. Mathematics For either degree.â3 session-hours. Natural Science For either degree.â6 session-hours in Biology B1, Chemistry B1, Geology B1 or Physics B1. COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES English For either degree.â6 session-hours, 3 of which may be in Biblical Literature, or Public Speaking, the other 3 being in English or English Literature. Social Science For either degree.â6 session-hours, 3 of which must be in History, the other 3 being in Economics B1, Government B1 or Sociology B1. Philosophy For either degree.â3 session-hours in Philosophy B1 or Psychology B1. Physical Education For either degree.âTwo years' course required of all candidates, which must be completed during the first two years unless the candidate is excused on a physician's certificate. Note.âA candidate entering with advanced standing or with college credit shall in his first, and, if necessary, continuously in subsequent sessions, take such courses as are necessary to complete the above requirements for the first and second sessions. (2) Electives-at-Large.âOf the remaining 27 session-hours required for the baccalaureate degree, 15 session-hours may be elected from any courses in the academic schools for which the candidate has adequate preparation. (3) Major-Electives.âThe remaining 12 session-hours required for either degree shall be known as Major-Electives. The Major-Electives shall include at least one C course (which must require two B courses as a prerequisite), and must all be offered from some one of the following Major-Groups of related subjects, except that when the Major-Group is Group III, the candidate may offer, in lieu of a C course, any 6-hour B course in this Group, for admission to which another 6-hour B course in the Group is prerequisite. The Major-Electives must all be completed in this College or in some professional department of this University. Group I.âLanguages, Literature, Fine Arts and Music. Group II.âSocial and Philosophical Sciences. Group III.âMathematical and Natural Sciences. (4) Substitutions for Major-Electives.âThe first-year course in Law, or the first-year course in Medicine or 12 session-hours of technical courses in one of the professional departments of Engineering or Education may be substituted for the 12 session-hours of Major-Electives in academic subjects. This work, which must be completed in one of the professional departments of this University, cannot be begun by the candidate until he has spent at least two sessions of nine months each in successful work in this College, and has at least 45 session-hours to his credit. COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES DEGREES WITH HONORS The courses required for the cultural B.A. and B.S. degrees are adapted to the powers of the average student, and any graduate of an accredited school, who has, either by certificate or examination, satisfied the requirements for admission to the College of Arts and Sciences, if he is reasonably industrious and regular in his studies, should obtain one of these degrees without great difficulty in four sessions' work. In every body of students, however, there are a number who possess greater ability and application than the average, and whose ambition aims higher than a bare pass-mark on their work. For the proper stimulation of such students toward the best that they can do, and for due and authoritative recognition of unusual ability and high achievement in studies, the Academic Faculty has instituted the following system of Special Honors: Intermediate Honors A certificate of Intermediate Honors is conferred by the Academic Faculty on the student who, during his first two regular sessions in the College of Arts and Sciences of this University, has passed on not less than 30 session-hours, including 3 session-hours in English, 3 session-hours in Mathematics and 6 session-hours in Foreign Language, without failure or re-examination on any course, and with an average grade on all courses of 85 per cent. or more each session. The holder of a Certificate of Intermediate Honors, so long as he has no grade below 75 per cent. on the work of any term in any course, is not subject to the rules limiting absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class-standing, imposed for absence alone. The Certificates of Intermediate Honors are publicly conferred at the Annual Convocation of the University following the session in which the honors have been attained. The names of the holders of these certificates are published under a separate heading in the annual catalogue of the University. Final Honors Final Honors are conferred only on graduation, and the diploma of B.A. or B.S. with Final Honors states that the honors were won in a given academic school. A student who wishes to attain Final Honors must be accepted as a candidate for honors two sessions before graduation. Any student who has met the requirements for the Dean's List for two sessions may apply to become a candidate for Final Honors. Application must be made first to the Dean, and, if approved by him, must also be approved by one of the academic schools which offer work for honors. A list of such schools is published annually. Final honors are conferred on the basis of a final comprehensive examination, both oral and written, on some field of knowledge, and not for work done in any or all of the regular courses required for a baccalaureate COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES degree. Honors work involves wide and independent reading for two years, under the general direction of the professors of an academic school. It does not require regular attendance upon lectures or the passing of any tests or examinations, except the final examination, though consultations and reports may be required. Its aim is the development of a capacity for scholarly work in a field of knowledge, rather than a mastery of required details of subject matter. The completion of work for Final Honors may be counted as credit towards a B.A. or cultural B.S. degree in lieu of 6 session-hours of Electives-at-Large or Major-Electives. In the event that the work for honors is not of sufficiently high quality for Final Honors to be conferred, 6 session-hours' credit toward a degree without honors may be granted upon recommendation of the academic school in charge. BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN A SPECIAL SUBJECT The degree of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject will be conferred upon regular students who have completed not less than 60 session-hours of undergraduate courses, taken in conformity with the following program: (1) Required Subjects: Candidates must complete 30 session-hours of required subjects as stated below, not less than 24 hours of which must be taken during the first two years, and the remaining 6 not later than the third year. Foreign Languages: 6 session-hours, of which 3 must be in French and 3 in German. Mathematics: 6 session-hours.* * Students applying for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Biology may substitute Biology C1 for 8 hours of Mathematics; students applying for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Geology may be permitted, at the discretion of the professor of Geology, to substitute Astronomy B1 for 3 hours of Mathematics. Natural Science: 12 session-hours in 2 subjects. English: 6 session-hours, of which 3 must be in English B6. Physical Education: Two years' course required of all candidates, which must be completed during the first two years.

      <field name="fulltext">DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES JOHN LLOYD NEWCOMB, B.A., C.E. Acting President of the University JOHN CALVIN METCALF, M.A., Litt.D., LL.D. Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE The Dean and Professors Manahan, Mitchell, Benton, Snavely, Balz, Jordan; for the Summer Quarter, The Dean and Professors Faulkner and Kepner. HISTORICAL STATEMENT While the original organization of the Academic Schools of the University by Jefferson contemplated instruction of graduate grade in each School, the first "post-graduate department" in the modern sense was instituted in 185960 by Basil L. Gildersleeve, then Professor of Greek in the institution. The degree of Master of Arts continued to be conferred upon graduates in all six Schools of the University. Professor Gildersleeve conducted graduate courses in the School of Greek; shortly after the Civil War a "post-graduate department" was announced for the School of Latin. Graduate courses were offered in individual Schools, but there was no general department organization for graduate study until 1904. In that year the Department of Graduate Studies was established as a regular co-ordinate division of the University, with definitely prescribed regulations corresponding to the requirements of the Association of American Universities, in which the University of Virginia was the first Southern university to hold membership. The degree of Doctor of Philosophy had, however, been offered by the University as far back as 1880, and the first doctor's degree was awarded in 1885. The present requirements for graduate degrees, with certain modifications, have been in force since 1904. THE GRADUATE HOUSE The Graduate House, administrative headquarters of the Department of Graduate Studies, is on West Lawn. Besides the Dean's office, this building contains one large lecture-room for graduate classes and four seminar rooms specially equipped for small groups of students and professors engaged in advanced graduate work. At present the class-rooms are used for certain advanced courses in the Schools of English and History. The Bruce Collection of books for the use of graduate students in English is in this building. This departmental library, endowed by the late Professor J. Douglas Bruce of the University of Tennessee, an alumnus of the University, contains valuable source material. DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES LIBRARY FACILITIES The University Libraries contain 192,383 volumes. Departmental libraries, notably those of the Scientific Schools, the Classical, the English, the Social Sciences, and the Heck Memorial Library of the Department of Education, have about 50,000 volumes. The Medical Library, now in the new Medical Buildings, is spacious and well equipped for graduate study. Graduate students may, through the office of the General Library, get certain books needed in research from other libraries on the interlibrary loan system. Library facilities for graduate study, both in arts and sciences, are steadily improving in books and other equipment. GRADUATE CLUBS An assembly of students and officials of the Graduate Department is held early in the session for professional and social purposes. Addresses are delivered by members of the Faculty or by visiting scholars. Besides this general meeting there are regular weekly or bi-weekly conferences of graduate students and professors for discussion of topics connected with graduate study. In the various physical sciences, in medical science, in the social sciences, and in humanistic studies, graduate clubs, composed of students and professors, are actively engaged in stimulating investigation and publication in their respective fields. The scientific society of Sigma Xi is an important organization for the advancement of technical knowledge. The University Committee on Research, while not specifically an organization of the Department of Graduate Studies, is a valuable auxiliary of the Department. This committee administers an annual appropriation for promoting research in the various Departments of the University, especially in the matter of the publication of the results of original investigation, and so aids the general cause of advanced scholarship. An annual volume, "Publications and Research," containing summaries of contributions by professors and students of the Graduate Department, is issued by the University. SCIENTIFIC LABORATORIES Each Scientific School occupies a separate building with an extensive laboratory and a select departmental library. Statements in regard to laboratories and general scientific equipment in the Schools of Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Physics, and the Department of Medicine may be found under the announcements of those Schools. More detailed information is contained in the General Catalogue. ORGANIZATION The immediate direction of the Department of Graduate Studies is vested in the Dean and an Administrative Committee of eight professors, appointed by the President, two of whom serve only during the Summer Quarter. The Faculty of the Graduate Department consists of those professors in the Academic Schools and the Medical School who offer graduate courses. DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES Courses marked C are for graduates and advanced undergraduates; those marked D are for graduates only. In the Department of Medicine the regular courses are evaluated as C courses; elective, special and research courses, and seminars as D courses. The prerequisites for each course are indicated, varying from 6 to 12 session-hours of college work. The various Schools, or departments, fall into four general divisions, or groups, as follows: Group IâLanguages, Literature, Fine Arts, and Music. English, French, German, Greek, Latin, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Biblical Literature, Architecture, Music. Group IIâSocial and Philosophical Sciences. Commerce, Economics, Education, History, Philosophy, Psychology, Political Science, Sociology. Group IIIâMathematical and Natural Sciences. Astronomy, Biology, Chemistry, Geology, Mathematics, Physics. Group IVâMedical Sciences. Anatomy and Anthropology, Bacteriology and Preventive Medicine, Biochemistry, Dermatology and Syphilology, Histology and Embryology, Neurology, Pathology, Pharmacology, Physiology and Surgery. REGISTRATION Every graduate student, new or old, is required to register at the office of the Dean of the Department, Graduate House, West Lawn, where he will be advised in regard to a program of studies. All women students must first register at the office of the Dean of Women, 20 East Lawn. The first three days of the session are devoted to registration. Every applicant for admission to the Graduate Department as candidate for a degree must file with the Dean an official transcript of his college record. Admission to the Department does not necessarily imply acceptance for candidacy for a degree. All applications will be passed upon by the Committee on Rules and Courses of the Department of Graduate Studies early in the first term, and each applicant will be formally notified by the Dean of the tentative approval of his candidacy. The final approval of his candidacy will depend upon his record during the first term, or quarter, of his residence. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Admission to the Department.âFor admission to the Department of Graduate Studies a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank is required, for men and women alike. For students in the Medical Science Group, the M. D. degree will be accepted in lieu of a baccalaureate degree. In order to become a candidate for a degree, the student must be advanced to candidacy by the Committee on Rules and Courses upon formal application, as set forth below. DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES Advancement to Candidacy for a Degree.âAny graduate student who wishes to become a candidate for a degree must file with the Dean of the Department his application on a blank form to be secured from the Dean's Secretary. This application must include a proposed program of work arranged in accordance with the requirements for the several degrees as stated below, and must be accompanied, in case the applicant does not hold an academic degree from this University, by an official transcript of the applicant's academic record made out by the Registrar of the institution from which the baccalaureate degree was received, and by a catalogue of that institution, marked to show the courses of study pursued. The application will be submitted by the Dean to the Committee on Rules and Courses, who will consider it in conference with the professors concerned. The Committee will have the right to require that the applicant add to his program any courses, undergraduate or graduate, considered necessary to supply his deficiencies, or to enable him to pursue with profit the courses he has selected. When the program has been finally approved, the Dean will report to the applicant his advancement to candidacy for a degree. It should be distinctly understood that graduate degrees are not conferred merely upon the basis of the number of courses passed, or of the length of time spent in resident or non-resident work, but upon the basis of the quality and scope of the candidate's knowledge, and his power of investigation in his chosen field of study. Candidates whose training and attainments are inferior cannot expect to secure a degree in the normal length of time estimated below for the respective degrees. As a prerequisite to full candidacy for a Master's degree, at least 6 collegiate session-hours of foreign language credit are required. A reading knowledge of foreign languages may be attested by an examination. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES Master of Arts.âThe degree of Master of Arts will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Arts who has fulfilled the following requirements: (1) The successful completion, in not less than one full year of resident graduate work, of the program of studies approved for the candidate by the Committee on Rules and Courses, as embodied in his formal application for advancement to candidacy. This application must be submitted early in the session in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The program must form a consistent plan of work, to be pursued with some definite aim, and grouped around some one subject to be known as the candidate's Major Subject, the name of which will be incorporated in the body of each diploma conferring the degree. The program should be arranged in consultation with the professors concerned, and must be approved in writing by a professor of the candidate's Major Subject, who shall be designated by the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies, after consultation with the candidate. Ordinarily, courses aggregating 12 session-hours, or 24 semester-hours, are required of candidates for a Master's degree. DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES (2) The preparation and submission of a thesis, to be accepted as satisfactory by the professor of the candidate's Major Subject. Two copies of the thesis, typewritten on paper of good quality, 8Â½ by 11 inches, and bound in stiff board or cloth covers, must be deposited in the office of the Dean of the Department of Graduates Studies not later than May 15 of the year in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The back of the cover must bear the title of the thesis and the writer's name, and the title page must carry the author's name, degree, and the subject of the thesis, followed by the words: A thesis presented to the Graduate Faculty of the University of Virginia in candidacy for the degree of Master of Arts. (3) A final comprehensive examination, oral or written, after the acceptance of the candidate's thesis, conducted by the candidate's major professor and two or more of his departmental colleagues. Master of Science.âThe degree of Master of Science will be conferred upon the holder of a degree of Bachelor of Science who fulfills requirements corresponding to those stated above for the degree of Master of Arts. The degree of Master of Science, like that of Master of Arts, is regarded as a cultural rather than a professional degree and the prerequisites for candidacy, including a reading knowledge of foreign languages, are estimated accordingly. No extension or correspondence courses will be credited toward a Master's degree. Doctor of Philosophy.âThe degree of Doctor of Philosophy will be conferred upon the holder of a baccalaureate degree who has fulfilled the following requirements: (1) A reading knowledge of French and German sufficient to enable the student to use these languages for purposes of research. This knowledge shall be attested by examinations in those languages set by the candidate's major professor, or by some one in his School designated by him. Examination papers shall be read and marked by professors in the Schools of French and German. The language examinations of candidates for the Ph.D. degree should be held by October 1 of the session preceding the final academic year of candidacy for the degree. Credit in this University for not less than 3 session-hours in B courses in either language may, on the approval of the School of the candidate's Major Subject, be accepted as satisfying the requirement in that language. Upon recommendation of the professor of the Major Subject, and at the discretion of the Graduate Committee, some other foreign language may be substituted for either French or German. (2) The successful completion, in not less than three full years of graduate work, of the program of studies approved for the candidate by the Graduate Committee as embodied in his formal application. The application for advancement to candidacy should be submitted to the Dean not later than October 15 of the session preceding the final year of candidacy for the degree, and must be submitted by October 15 of his final year. The program of studies must include a Major Subject, pursued for at least three years, and a Minor Subject, pursued for at least one year. The Minor Subject must be closely related to the Major Subject, and the program as a whole must contribute to the mastery of some definite field of knowledge as an object of study and research. The name DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES of the Major Subject will be incorporated in the body of the diploma conferring the degree. At least one year of advanced graduate study, preferably the last, must be spent in residence. By special permission of the Graduate Committee the student may be allowed to complete his dissertation in absentia under the direction of his major professor. (3) A Dissertation exhibiting independent research in some branch of the candidate's Major Subject, submitted in complete form to the Special Departmental Committee, of which the candidate's major professor is chairman, not later than May 1 of the last year of candidacy. The two copies submitted shall be typewritten upon paper of good quality, 8Â½ by 11 inches, and substantially bound. The cover shall bear the title of the dissertation and the name of the writer; the title page shall also carry the subject of the dissertation, with the author's name and academic degree or degrees, and in addition the following words: A Dissertation presented to the Graduate Faculty of the University of Virginia in candidacy for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. Upon approval of the dissertation the candidate shall arrange for the publication, at the earliest practicable date, of the whole or such portions of the dissertation as the Departmental Committee shall direct. With the consent of the department concerned, the dissertation may be lithoprinted. If publication prior to the conferring of the degree be impracticable, the candidate must deposit with the Bursar the sum of One Hundred Dollars as a guarantee that 52 copies will be deposited in the University Library when printed. This sum will be returned to the author by the Bursar upon notification by the Librarian that this requirement has been complied with. (4) A final examination, oral, written, or both, in addition to all examinations in course, upon such phases of the Major Subject and of allied subjects, as the Special Committee (described below) shall prescribe. Ordinarily no candidate may be admitted to the final examination until his dissertation has been accepted. Preliminary examinations may, in addition, be required by individual Schools, as stated under the announcements of these Schools. Upon approval of the dissertation, the Dean will appoint, upon nomination of the School concerned, a Special Committee of not less than three professors under the chairmanship of the professor of the candidate's Major Subject, and including a representative of the Graduate Committee. This Special Committee may, through its chairman, invite other members of the departmental faculty to take part in the examination of the candidate. The result of the examination should be promptly reported to the Registrar. Grade.âA graduate student's standing in a course is indicated by one of the following symbols: A, B+, B, C. A, B+, and B are passing grades: A is distinguished, B+ is very good, B is satisfactory, C is unsatisfactory. Failure to attain the grade of B on any one term will invalidate candidacy for the degree in the current session. Only graduate courses may be counted toward a graduate degree. Summer Session.âThe Master's degree may be won by properly qualified persons in three full Summer Quarters. In no case will this degree be conferred without resident graduate study during three quarters, the equivalent in time of the long session. Not more than two graduate courses each DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES term of the Summer Quarter will be credited toward the degree except by special permission of the Dean and the Committee concerned. At least 12 session-hours of graduate work are required for the Master's degree. A candidate for the Master's degree in the Summer Quarter must register with the Dean of the Graduate Department and submit a program of studies in accordance with the regulations prescribed for admission to candidacy for that degree in the long session. In addition to the preparation of a thesis, a final examination, written or oral, upon the program of study and acceptable to the professor of the candidate's Major Subject in the long session of the University, will be required. Candidates for degrees at the Summer Quarter Convocation must hand in their theses by August 1 and take their final comprehensive examinations as soon as their theses have been approved. Graduate Students in the Summer Quarter are required to make their Masters' degrees within five summers after admission to full candidacy. Graduate students are strongly advised to continue their residence during one or more terms of the long session. Candidates for degrees at the Summer Quarter Convocation must notify the Graduate office of their intentions at the beginning of the Summer Quarter. Fellowships.âA list of Fellowships available for graduate students will be found on page 174. A special Bulletin of the Department of Graduate Studies is issued each year. This contains detailed information as to courses and regulations of the Department, and should be consulted by persons interested. This Bulletin and further information will be supplied by the Dean of the Department of Graduate Studies.</field>

WHITLOCK, Normal Diploma, University of Virginia Summer Quarter Teacher in Liberty Experimental Rural School HISTORY The Curry Memorial School of Education was founded in 1905 as one of the academic schools of the University. It was endowed by gifts of $100,000 from John D. Rockefeller and $50,000 from the General Education Board, and was named in honor of Dr. J. L. M. Curry, the Southern educator. There were originally two professorships in the School, the Curry Memorial Professorship of Education and the Professorship of Secondary Education. In 1914 a chair of Educational Psychology and Principles of Teaching was added to the School, and two years later a Professorship of School Administration was established. In 1919 the School was organized into a Department of the University, with four professorships, and was placed upon a professional basis similar to that of the Departments of Law, Medicine and Engineering. The relation of the Department of Education to the various academic schools of the University remains close, however, since the academic training of students of Education is obtained in the academic schools, and courses in Education are credited toward the academic degrees. In the spring of 1928 plans were matured to provide more adequate facilities for observation, practice teaching, and experimental studies. The school authorities of the City of Charlottesville and the County of Albemarle joined with the University of Virginia in establishing a program of experimental education and teacher-training. After the preliminary program of organization had been approved, the General Education Board of New York City granted to the University a subsidy of $20,000 a year for a period of two years to forward the program and make possible its operation for the session of 1928-29. The Rector and Visitors of the University made a supplementary appropriation of $5,000 annually for a period of two years, thereby giving the Department additional funds amounting to $50,000 for the biennium, 1928-1930. PURPOSE The rapid development of educational science and practice has made it necessary that ample provision be made for the professional training of those who expect to teach or to administer school affairs. The Department of Education, therefore, aims to provide the following: DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 1. An opportunity for the study of Education as an important function of society. 2. To give the necessary technical training for teaching and administration to: a. University students, with or without experience, who intend to teach; b. Secondary school principals; c. Normal school teachers and administrators; d. College teachers of Education; e. School superintendents, supervisors, and other executives of schools of all grades in cities, counties, and states. 3. To develop scientific methods of testing school work and to furnish demonstrations of the way in which these methods may best be applied, thus developing a spirit of observation and experimentation tending to increase our knowledge of the science and art of education. 4. To become a center of educational influence to which teachers of all grades and kinds may come for information and educational guidance. 5. To furnish to the general public information on any phase of school organization, administration, and supervision, thus helping to create a clearer general understanding about Education and the State. PEABODY HALL Peabody Hall, the Education Building, was named in honor of George Peabody, who in 1867 made his great gift to the cause of education in the South. The building was made possible through a gift of $40,000 from the trustees of the Peabody Education Fund. This amount was supplemented by an appropriation of $12,000 from the Rector and Visitors of the University. The building was completed in 1912, and is the home of the Curry Memorial Department of Education. The plans were drawn by a modern school architect, and approved by some of the leading authorities on school architecture in this country. It is, therefore, a model of excellence in this regard. It is one of the best equipped buildings in the University, and has ample classroom and laboratory facilities, and an excellent auditorium equipped with a modern motion picture machine. Modern requirements in heating, lighting and ventilation are exemplified in its construction without sacrificing conformity to the general style of classic architecture prevailing in the University. Adequate provision is made for a Departmental library, seminar rooms, classrooms, psychological laboratory, and offices for the administrative officers and teaching staff of the Department. THE HECK MEMORIAL LIBRARY The Department of Education maintains its own library in Peabody Hall, named in honor of the first professor of Education in the University, the late Professor William Harry Heck. The library was made possible through the gift by Mrs. Anna Tuttle Heck of Professor Heck's private library containing DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION approximately 2,000 well-selected books on Education, and the transfer of all books on Education from the General Library of the University. Splendid equipment was procured through a gift of money from students in Education, the Education Club and friends of Professor Heck. A gift of $3,000 from Mr. Alfred W. Erickson of New York City has enabled the Department so to strengthen its professional library as to offer very superior facilities to its rapidly growing student body, by making possible the enrichment of every course now offered. At present the library consists of several thousand select books covering most fields of Education, a complete file of publications of the United States Bureau of Education, various national, state and foreign documents, state school laws, annual reports of state superintendents of public instruction, city superintendents' reports, etc. Files of the leading educational magazines are available for free use of the students. Exhibits of elementary and high school texts for comparative studies are made available through the generosity of various publishers. SCHOLARSHIPS The Virginia State Teachers' Scholarships in the Department of Education: thirty scholarships annually, twenty each with a value of $200, and ten each with a value of $100, were established in 1918 by action of the General Assembly of Virginia. The holder must be a Virginian in need of financial assistance in order to attend the University; and he must pledge himself to teach or engage in some other form of public school work in Virginia for at least two years, or, failing this, to repay to the University the full value of the scholarship. Blank forms of application may be had upon request to Dean John L. Manahan, Chairman of the Committee on State Teachers' Scholarships. Appointments prior to September 1 of each year are made upon the recommendation of division superintendents. Any scholarships unassigned on September 1 are open to applicants from the State at large. In addition to the Virginia State Teachers' Scholarships, there are a number of other scholarships in the University available for students of Education. A detailed description of them is given in the General Catalogue of the University. LOAN FUNDS AND STUDENT SELF-HELP The University is in possession of funds from which loans are made to deserving students in need of such assistance. An account of these loans is given in the General Catalogue. Inquiries concerning them should be addressed to the Bursar. Opportunities for obtaining remunerative employment are afforded to students who are desirous by this means of partially paying their way through the University. It is difficult to give definite assurance of employment to a student before he reaches the University, but it may be stated that any student with sufficient resources to carry him through the first half of the session can be reasonably sure of obtaining work which will help defray his expenses for the rest of the academic year. Information as to employment may be obtained by addressing the Director, Box 1487, University, Virginia. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION SECONDARY EDUCATION IN VIRGINIA The Department of Education publishes under the editorship of Dr. W. R. Smithey, Professor of Secondary Education, a high school quarterly called Secondary Education in Virginia, devoted to the encouragement of research in Virginia secondary school problems for both public and private schools and to the reporting of research through its columns. This publication is the official organ of the Department of Education, and addressed primarily to the solution of problems of secondary education in Virginia and its columns are open to all workers in this field. It aims to encourage educational research in secondary education. THE DEAN'S LIST A student who passes on not less than 15 session-hours during a session with an average of at least 85 per cent., and with no session grade less than 75 per cent., will be placed on the Dean's List, and will remain on the List as long as he receives an average of at least 85 per cent., on at least 15 session-hours per term and receives no term grade less than 75 per cent. in any course. Any student on the Dean's List failing to maintain this standard of excellence will be automatically dropped from the List. A student once dropped from the List can again make the Dean's List by meeting the above standard for entire session. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting the issuance of leaves of absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone. EXPENSES The necessary expenses of a Virginia student in the Department of Education may be estimated at from $425 a year upward, according to the mode of living; for students from other states, $600 and upward. A fuller statement of expenses will be found on page 164. COOPERATIVE PROGRAM BETWEEN THE SCHOOL BOARD OF THE CITY OF CHARLOTTESVILLE AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA Facilities for observation and directed teaching and for practical educational research are made available through the coÃ¶peration with the University of the school systems of the City of Charlottesville and the County of Albemarle. The CoÃ¶perative Teacher-Training Program entered into between the School Board of the City of Charlottesville and the University of Virginia provides for the employment of critic teachers in the following subjects: English, Latin, Mathematics, Natural Science and Social Science. The agreement as adopted includes the following regulations: 1. The critic teachers shall be chosen by the University with the approval of the superintendent of schools, it being recognized that no person DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION may be elected by the School Board without the recommendation of the superintendent of schools. 2. The duties of the critic teachers shall be as follows: A. To teach two regular classes in the high school such as shall be agreed upon by the critic teacher, the principal of the high school and the superintendent of schools. B. To serve as critic teacher for the direction of the teaching of such student teachers as are assigned to him. C. To perform such routine duties in connection with the classes taught as would fall to the lot of any high school teacher in a city school system in Virginia. D. To conduct such experimental studies as the wisdom of the critic teacher, the principal of the high school and the superintendent of schools may deem advisable for the improvement of the school. Proposals for all such experimental studies shall originate with the Department of Education in the University of Virginia. 3. The salaries of the critic teachers shall be paid as follows: A. The City School Board shall pay the pro rata amount for the two regular classes taught that would be paid to any high school teacher for doing the same work according to the fixed salary schedule in effect from time to time. B. The remainder of the salary shall be paid by the University. 4. The critic teacher may teach a special methods course in the subject-matter field of his assignment, this work to be done at the University. COOPERATIVE PROGRAM BETWEEN THE ALBEMARLE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD AND THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA The CoÃ¶perative Program entered into between the School Board of the County of Albemarle and the University of Virginia provides facilities for observation and practice in the high schools of the County for the training of high school teachers and principals under a director of high school supervision; and laboratory training for rural supervisors in the elementary schools of the County under two assistant professors of rural supervision. Provision is also made for the training of division superintendents of schools under the direction of Superintendent A. L. Bennett. CRITIC TEACHERS AND DEPARTMENTAL SUPERVISORS The duties of the critic teachers and departmental supervisors in the County high schools are as follows: 1. To act as general departmental supervisor in the subject-matter field of his assignment. 2. To teach two regular classes in the high school of which he is a member of the teaching staff, such as shall be assigned by the Director of Supervision acting in agreement with the principal of the high school and division superintendent of schools.

To recommend to the principal pupil-assignment to studies in his departmental field. DUTIES OF THE RURAL SUPERVISORS The coÃ¶perative program between the University and the County of Albemarle made possible the employment of two superior rural supervisors, bringing the supervisory staff for elementary schools to five. These two supervisors, in addition to supervising all elementary schools in the districts assigned to them, direct the training of rural supervisors. In order that there may be adequate opportunity for experimentation in one-room schools two schools within easy reach of the University have been chosen for special study and demonstration by the rural supervisors. It is hoped that the record of achievement in these two schools may serve as an example and stimulus, not only to the schools of the county, but of a much wider area. TRAINING OF ELEMENTARY SUPERVISORS Students preparing for elementary school supervision must have (1) previous training equivalent to that required for the Virginia Normal Professional Certificate, and (2) at least two years of successful teaching experience in elementary schools attested by letters of recommendation from division superintendents of schools under whom the teaching was done. It is a general requirement in connection with Education B4 that students shall be present for the opening of the schools in Albemarle County for the purpose of studying the problems of school organization. The schools usually open during the first week in September. COLLEGIATE PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE Recipients of the Bachelor of Science in Education will receive the Collegiate Professional Certificate, the highest form of certificate for high school teachers issued by the State Board of Education. This certificate is valid for ten years, renewable for a similar period, and entitles the holder to teach in both high and elementary schools in Virginia. Holders of Collegiate Certificates, the certificates of second rank issued by the State Board of Education, may obtain the Collegiate Professional Certificate by attending the University one session and taking four 3 session-hour courses in Education. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Curricula organized to meet the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Education fulfill both academic and professional requirements for the highest grade of professional high school certificates issued without examination by the various state departments of Education to holders of baccalaureate degrees. The graduate courses in Education are recognized in states requiring graduate study for professional certificates. TEACHERS' CERTIFICATES A resolution of the State Board of Education provides that on and after September 1, 1929, the minimum qualifications for those persons beginning to teach in an accredited high school shall be a baccalaureate degree from a standard four-year college. In accordance with the above regulations it will not be necessary after September 1, 1929, to issue to incoming teachers the Special or Junior College Certificate. The new requirement for high school teachers will not be retroactive. THE SUMMER QUARTER The Summer Quarter is an integral part of the University year. Courses in the College of Arts and Sciences, as well as in the Department of Education, are the same in character and in credit value as in any other Quarter of the University. Degrees are conferred upon men and women upon exactly the same terms for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. Those who contemplate completing their degree requirements in the Summer Quarter should keep clearly in mind, in estimating the time that will be required, that the normal amount of credit which may be taken in one Summer Quarter is 6 session-hours. Candidates for a degree who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired.

The Master's degree may be obtained by properly qualified persons in three Summer Quarters. In no case is this degree to be conferred upon any person who has not attended and done graduate work three full Summer Quarters or the equivalent time in the regular session of the University and the Summer Quarter. On account of the increasing demand for graduate work in the Summer Quarter, the number of graduate courses will be enlarged in 1932. All persons who are looking forward ultimately to taking a degree through summer work are urgently requested to file with the Dean of the Summer DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION Quarter an official statement of their entrance requirements and work for which college credit is desired. Blanks for this purpose will be mailed upon application. First Term begins June 20 and ends July 30. Second Term begins August 1 and ends September 3. In order to provide for the increasing number of students who complete the requirements for their degrees during the Summer Quarter, a convocation exercise will be held Friday evening, September 2, at 8 o'clock, when the degrees will be conferred.

JOSEPHINE McLEOD, B.A., Diploma, Johns Hopkins Hospital Training School for Nurses, Baltimore, Md., Assistant Professor of Nursing Education. HISTORY The movement to endow a Chair of Nursing at the University of Virginiaâthe first step in the foundation of the Schoolâwas launched in the spring of 1923 by the Graduate Nurses' Association of Virginia. Through the zealous and praiseworthy efforts of this group of women, the sum of $50,000.00 was raised and presented to the University. The Chair of Nursing Education was named in honor of Sadie Heath Cabaniss, Virginia's outstanding pioneer nurse. In April, 1928, the first Cabaniss Memorial Professor of Nursing Education was appointed. The School was then placed under the Department of Education and organization begun. Beginning with the academic year of 1928-29, the Cabaniss Memorial School of Nursing Education has offered courses of university grade for graduate nurses. PURPOSE The purpose of the School is to give further preparation to well qualified nurses who desire to better fit themselves as supervisors, administrators or teachers in hospital schools for undergraduate students. There is a very urgent need for more and better-prepared women to fill the hospital positions, not only in Virginia but over the entire country. And the demand for nurses who have prepared themselves by special study for these executive and teaching positions is far in excess of the supply. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION In addition to affording opportunities for study and training to the individual student, the School of Nursing Education, as part of the State University, offers its services to nursing school authorities throughout Virginia, with a desire to coÃ¶perate in the solution of practical problems and in the furtherance of nursing education in the State. GENERAL STATEMENT Professional programs are arranged for three groups as follows: 1. Teachers in Schools of Nursing. 2. Supervisors and Head Nurses in Schools of Nursing. 3. Administrators in Schools of Nursing. The courses are planned on a three-year basis leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Nursing Education. Applicants meeting all entrance requirements may secure the maximum credit of a year's work for their course in an approved school of nursing. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS To be admitted to regular standing in the School of Nursing Education, applicants must be registered nurses, graduates of schools of nursing of approved standards and in addition must meet the regular entrance requirements of the University by certificate from an accredited high school or private secondary school, giving the equivalent of four years of satisfactory high school work, or by examination. Furthermore, at least one year of graduate experience in some educational or executive work in schools of nursing is highly desirable for all prospective students. For admission by certificate, the applicant should file with the School not later than September 1, a Certificate of Preparation made out on a blank form furnished upon request. And a special blank giving applicant's professional training and experience will be required of all students. All women students must first register at the office of the Dean of Women, 20 East Lawn. Special Students.âA limited number of graduate nurses of more mature age whose general education has not included a complete high school course may be admitted as special students. But they must present evidence of satisfactory professional and personal qualifications and ability to pursue the courses in Nursing Education successfully. No special student may be a candidate for a degree; but such students are permitted and encouraged to make up deficiencies by private study or by taking courses in the Summer Quarter. They will then be admitted as regular students, and may be accepted as applicants for the degree, provided all entrance requirements are met at least one academic year before the date of graduation. College Credit.âA maximum of 15 session-hours may be granted for one year of college work and 33 hours for two years. In no case will credit be given on more than 33 session-hours of work done in another college, and any student who receives this maximum amount of credit must take the remaining DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION 15 session-hours required for her degree in residence in a regular session of nine months in this University.

Junior and Senior Mechanics and Electrical Engineering ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS For admission to the Freshman Class in the Department of Engineering the candidate must be at least sixteen years old. He must present a certificate of honorable withdrawal from the school last attended, or other valid proof of general good character. He must further satisfy the Dean of the University as to his adequate preparation for the work by passing the Entrance Examinations specified below or by the presentation of equivalent certificates of preparation signed by the president of a recognized institution of collegiate rank, or by the principal of an accredited high school. An applicant for admission from outside of Virginia may be required to supplement his application by an interview with a representative of the University. The topics required for entrance and their values in units are as follows, the unit being one year's work on the subject in an accredited high school: DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING English A.âGrammar and Grammatical Analysis 1 English B.âComposition and Rhetoric 1 English C.âCritical study of Specimens of Literature 1 Mathematics A1.âAlgebra to Quadratics 1 Mathematics A2.âQuadratics, Progressions, Binomial Formula 1 Mathematics B.âPlane Geometry 1 Mathematics C.âSolid Geometry Â½ Mathematics D.âPlane Trigonometry Â½ History.âAncient; Medieval; English; American (any one) 1 Electives 7 Total 15 High school students who expect to study Engineering are advised to include among their electives at least one Foreign Language (Latin or French or German), one Science (Chemistry or Physics with adequate laboratory work) and an additional unit of History. Other electives which may be profitably offered are History of English and American Literature, Greek, Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, Physical Geography. A candidate may be admitted as a Conditioned Student in spite of some deficiencies in required entrance subjects, provided these are not such as will impair the integrity of his work, but he must submit not less than 15 units. No such candidate will be conditioned except upon subjects actually taught in this University, nor will any candidate be conditioned on more than 2 units; and all conditions must be absolved before the beginning of the next session after initial registration. Courses taken for the removal of entrance conditions may in no case be counted as part of the work credited for any degree. No conditions will be allowed in English A or B or in Mathematics A1, A2, or B. As the table of Entrance Requirements shows, the full High School course in Mathematics is required for entrance to the Department of Engineering, but unfortunately the graduates of the High Schools are often deficient in Solid Geometry and Plane Trigonometry and can be admitted only upon conditions in those subjects. High School principals are advised to urge their graduates, with this status, to attend a Summer Session at the University before entering the Department of Engineering so that these deficiencies may be overcome. If the prospective student finds it impossible to attend a Summer School previous to his regular matriculation, a course has been planned which will allow him to make up his deficiencies by taking work in the Summer School following his first year in Engineering. This course provides for Trigonometry, Solid Geometry and College Algebra in the three terms of the regular session, with the other work as outlined for the regular student, and in addition, in the two terms of the Summer School, Analytical and CoÃ¶rdinate Geometry are taken. Such a program will prepare the student for Sophomore standing and will save him from the failure usually encountered by students who attempt to make up the deficient work in regular session in addition to the full course of required subjects. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING A candidate may be admitted as a Special Student, without formal examination, provided he is more than twenty years old if a Virginian and not less than twenty-three years old if a non-Virginian, and gives evidence of serious purpose and of fitness to pursue with profit the courses for which he is registered. No special student may be a candidate for any degree. No conditioned student may register later as a special student. ADMISSION OF WOMEN Women are admitted as candidates for the Engineering Degrees but not as Special Students. A candidate must be at least twenty years old on the birthday preceding matriculation; must present certificates showing graduation from an accredited public high-school, or not less than four years' attendance in an accredited private school, with credit for not less than 15 college entrance units obtained at least two years before admission to the University; and must in addition show by proper certificate the completion in a standard college, subsequent to the credit obtained for 15 entrance-units, of at least 30 session-hours (60 semester-hours), of courses of college grade, in not less than eighteen calendar months. ADVANCED STANDING Under the elective system of the University of Virginia, a student who has completed courses of college or university grade in other institutions of learning on mathematical or scientific subjects may be excused from attendance upon these courses by the Dean, with the advice and consent of the professor in charge, and will then be registered for the more advanced work, provided the full entrance requirements have been satisfied. In order to secure College Credit upon such courses toward a degree in Engineering from this University, the applicant must showâ 1. That the courses offered are coextensive with the corresponding courses as given in the University of Virginia. 2. That his grades on them were not below the 75 per cent. pass-mark of this University. Such credits may be granted by the faculty upon the recommendation of the Dean and the professors in charge; but are automatically revoked by the failure of the student to pass in the more advanced courses in the related topics. Advanced standing in the technical engineering subjects of higher grade than those of the Sophomore year will not be given except to graduates of other institutions offering technical engineering instruction and then only upon special consideration of each application for such advanced standing. No degree in Engineering will be awarded for less than one full year's work in a regular session of this University and the work of a candidate's last year must be performed in residence here. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING The same rules apply to Credits on Summer School Courses; except that for courses in the Summer School of this University the examination questions must be prepared by the professor in charge of the regular course, and the answers must be read and graded by him. Students, suspended from other universities, are not granted college credits on courses previously passed, except upon the explicit recommendation of the suspending university, and after such additional tests as this Engineering Faculty may impose. Credits on Practice-Courses in Drawing, or Field-work may be granted to applicants who have gained in professional practice the training which these courses represent. Such applicants must file with the Dean proper certificates from the official under whom the work was done and must in every case pass an additional practical test on the subjects for which credit is desired. College credit is not granted for high-school work. PROGRAMS OF STUDY The candidate who has satisfied the requirements for entrance as above defined is matriculated as a student of Engineering and admitted to the Freshman Class. The studies of this class comprise lecture courses in English, Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Chemistry with associated laboratory courses in Chemistry, Drawing, and Field-work. For advancement to the Sophomore Class the student must have completed at least two-thirds of his Freshman work. Upon entering this class the students majoring in Chemical and Mechanical Engineering begin their specialized work, while all others pursue identical courses of study through the year. On entering the Junior year each student elects his specialty. At this time the students of Mechanical Engineering must choose either the power or the aeronautical option. The courses thereafter diverge according to the major subject chosen by the student. Programs of study for each degree are given below. The courses are so ordered that the specified entrance requirements are adequate for the work of the Freshman Year. Each succeeding year presupposes the completion of the work for all the foregoing years. Students are advised to adhere strictly to the regular programs. The arrangements specified in them have been carefully planned and are the best. Departures from the curriculum will in almost every case produce conflicts in lecture hours or laboratory periods and may cost the student a year's time. Haphazard election is discouraged and in extreme cases will be prohibited. No student will be registered for a course unless, in the opinion both of the Dean and of the professor, his preliminary training has fitted him for the profitable pursuit of that course. Students are especially advised against the attempt to crowd too many studies into their scheme of work, and are warned that admission to advanced courses will be granted only to those who have adequate mathematical and scientific training to profit by them. Men overloaded with work, too great in volume or in difficulty for their powers, suffer inevitable discouragement and incur almost certain failure. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING Changes of classes with transfer of fees may be made, subject to the approval of the Dean, within two weeks after the beginning of any term. Thereafter such changes may be made only by special order of the faculty, and then without transfer of fees. Upon the completion of the four years' course as defined in any one of the Programs of Study, the faculty will award to any student in regular and honorable standing the degree of Bachelor of Science in Engineering. Upon the completion of the additional Graduate Course in a satisfactory manner the faculty will award the appropriate degree of Chemical Engineer, Civil Engineer, Electrical Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, or Mining Engineer. The five-year curriculum has been adopted at the University of Virginia in view of the impressive and growing demand from practicing engineers and industrial leaders that Schools of Engineering should enlarge the field of study to embrace more of the humanities and better opportunities for student research, to the end that the graduates may be better fitted to undertake their duties as engineers and citizens. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION The Subjects of Instruction in Engineering are grouped into classes, each designated by a distinctive number for each term, the lecture and laboratory courses being likewise differentiated. This grouping follows the arrangement shown below: Humanities 1 to 99 Mathematics 100 to 199 Physics 200 to 299 Chemistry 300 to 399 Geology 400 to 499 Applied Mathematics 500 to 599 Experimental Engineering 600 to 699 Civil Engineering including Field-work 700 to 799 Mechanical Engineering including Aeronautics 800 to 899 Electrical Engineering 900 to 999 Lecture courses are listed in the first fifty numbers of all classes; laboratory or practice courses are listed in the second fifty numbers of all classes.

Associate Professor Hitchcock. 386-387-388: Chemical Engineering Research: This course is designed for candidates for the Ch. E. degree and affords an introduction to research methods. Fundamental problems are selected, whenever possible, from the field of greatest interest to the student. The method of attack is in general to reduce the selected problem to laboratory scale leading to the collection of basic data susceptible of definite interpretation, rather than to attempt special investigations on semi-plant equipment which usually lead to merely empirical data. The use of the chemical literature as an aid in conducting investigations accompanies the laboratory work, as well as practice in the mathematical and graphical treatment of the data obtained. The preparation and submission of a satisfactory thesis marks the completion of this course, and is a partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Ch. E. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING degree. Two copies of the thesis, typewritten on paper of prescribed quality and size, and substantially bound, must be deposited in the office of the Dean of the Department of Engineering not later than May 15 of the year in which it is expected that the degree will be conferred. The back of the cover must bear the title of the thesis and the writer's name, and the title page must bear the words: A thesis presented to the Engineering Faculty of the University of Virginia in candidacy for the degree of Chemical Engineer. (Fall, Winter, Spring.) Associate Professor Hitchcock. Advanced Courses: A number of advanced courses in Chemistry, not listed above, are described in the catalogue of the College.

SUMMER SCHOOL In the Summer School at the University of Virginia it has been possible for some time to procure many of the non-technical courses required in the engineering curricula, such as Chemistry, Physics, Commercial Law, Economics and the Modern Languages. In the Summer School of 1932 there will be given for the first time the following courses as they are given in the regular session: English 1-2-3; Mathematics 100-106-107 and 108-109-110 with 158-159-160. In addition at least two courses in Mechanics will again be offered from the three 526, 527 and 528. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING STUDENT BRANCHES OF NATIONAL PROFESSIONAL SOCIETIES There have been established at the University of Virginia Student Branches of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (1912), the American Society of Civil Engineers (1921) and the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (1922). These societies hold regular meetings for the discussion of periodical literature and the exposition by resident and visiting engineers of the present-day problems in Engineering. A valuable feature of the meetings is the opportunity presented for practice in public speaking and debate. At stated meetings the Branches hold joint sessions for the discussion of mutually interesting questions. A local society for students of Chemical Engineering was organized in 1929. TAU BETA PI In May, 1921, a chapter of the National Honorary Engineering Fraternity Tau Beta Pi was granted and the Alpha of Virginia Chapter of Tau Beta Pi will henceforth serve to further inspire high scholarship and integrity. This fraternity is recognized as the leading honorary engineering fraternity of this country and its chapters are found in a limited number of engineering schools of the highest standing. The members are elected with care and the standards maintained are rigid both in respect to scholarship and character. THETA TAU In June, 1923, a chapter of the National Engineering Fraternity of Theta Tau was granted at the University of Virginia. This fraternity has chapters in a score or more of the leading engineering schools of the country and membership is eagerly sought and greatly appreciated by the members of the student body. Elections are made each year based on scholarship and general record of ability and promise of future service to the profession of engineering. TRIGON SOCIETY The Trigon Engineering Society was founded at the University of Virginia early in the spring of 1923. It is a local organization which has for its object the broadening of the education of the engineering student by fraternal and social contact and by encouraging lectures and study on subjects aside from those dealing primarily with engineering. The society is active in the student affairs of the department and is always ready to help in any undertaking for the betterment of the Engineering School. Members are selected for their personality, sociability, and promise of high engineering attainment. ALPHA CHI SIGMA On May 27, 1922, a charter was granted at the University of Virginia, creating the Alpha Kappa chapter of the National Chemical Fraternity of Alpha Chi Sigma. This fraternity recognizes high scholarship, character, and seriousness of purpose in students specializing in chemistry and chemical engineering. As the DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING leading national fraternity in this field, it has 47 active college chapters, 10 professional chapters, and 6 professional groups, serving to advance chemistry and chemical engineering both scientifically and professionally. Among the regular activities of the local chapter are the sponsoring of the annual Alpha Chi Sigma lecture, the award of a membership in the American Chemical Society to the outstanding student in chemistry and chemical engineering, and general assistance to the faculty in the conduct of official functions. JONES AND BARKSDALE MEMORIAL FUNDS A gift to the Department of Engineering from Messrs. Arthur P. Jones, William Barham Jones (B.A. 1907) and Major Kenneth S. Jones (B.A., LL.B., C. E. 1915, Major U. S. A., Engineer Corps) in memory of their father, the late Walter H. Jones, of Norfolk, Va., and of his deep interest in the University of Virginia, in the form of an endowment fund has made it possible to provide a considerable number of professional periodicals representing the various engineering activities. A gift to the Department of Engineering from Mrs. Hamilton Barksdale in memory of her husband, an alumnus of the Engineering Department, specifically donated for the purpose of building up the department library, will make possible at once much needed changes and additions to the library.

The examination day for a particular course is indicated in the table above by the Roman numeral in the first or last columns, for the corresponding lecture hours in the middle column. The examination period covers ten days at the end of each term. Examination days change each term. A change in lecture for any course will change the examination day correspondingly. Classes for which lecture periods are not indicated will have examination days fixed by the arranged lecture hour in accordance with above schedule. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING EXPENSES OF REGULAR STUDENTS The average annual expense of a student who pursues the regular course in Engineering will be: NonVirginians Virginians University Fee $ 60 $ 50 Tuition 200 115 (avg.) Athletic Fee 15 15 Laboratory Fees (average) 35 35 Living Expenses (for nine months) 420 420 Books and Drawing Materials 30 30 Incidental Expenses (for nine months) 60 60 Total annual for average conditions $820 $725 The charges for Tuition are uniform to all students, except that Virginians are relieved of tuition on courses offered in the College, this exception saving regular Freshmen from Virginia $135 and all other Virginia students $70 each year in comparison with non-Virginians. The laboratory charges are $15 per class for the year's course in Physics, and $20 per class for a year's course in Chemistry. A deposit for breakage of $5 is required for each laboratory course in Chemistry. A fee of $5 each for the year's course in Engineering Geology and in Mineralogy is charged. The fee for each practice course in the Engineering Department, Drawing, and Engineering Laboratories is $5 per term for each course. The fees for Field-work and Bridge Drafting are each $10 per term per course. These fees include all charges for laboratory materials; but the student is held further responsible for breakage. The Living Expenses include board, lodging, fuel and lights, servant and laundry; the average is $10.00 per week, the minimum $7.50, and a reasonable maximum $12.50. Books and Drawing Materials will cost about $120 for the four-year course. Incidental Expenses ought to be kept within modest bounds; the above estimate is sufficient; large allowances of pocket money promote idleness and attract companions of the baser sort. No allowances are included for clothing and travel, the expenses for which vary too much to be introduced into any general estimate. The charges payable on entrance are the University Fee, the Athletic Fee, and the Tuition and Laboratory Fees. SCHOLARSHIPS The Philip Francis duPont Scholarships: Founded in 1928 upon the generous bequest of Philip Francis duPont, '00: In the Department of Engineering a number of these scholarships are awarded annually to both new and old students of the department. The emolument will vary from $100 to $300, depending upon the income available, with apportionment at the discretion of the Faculty of Engineering. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING The tenure of each scholarship is one year, but any incumbent may be reappointed upon recommendation of the Dean. Applicants for these scholarships who have not previously attended the University must have complied with the entrance requirements before their applications can be considered; they must give evidence of financial need; and they must have ranked in the highest quarter of their class. Preference is given to applicants who ranked in the highest tenth of their class. Applications must be made on a blank form supplied by the Dean. Students who have not attended the University must submit their applications not later than July 1; students attending the University must apply not later than May 1. The Isabella Merrick Sampson Scholarship in the Department of Engineering, with an income of $100: Founded in 1910 upon the gift of Mr. W. Gordon Merrick, of Glendower, Albemarle County, Virginia. Appointments are made upon the recommendation of the trustees of the Isabella Merrick Sampson Endowment. Preference is given to an applicant from Albemarle County. A limited number of additional scholarships may be granted in the Department of Engineering from those general scholarships open to any department of the University. A complete statement regarding all scholarships will be found in the General Catalogue. LOAN FUNDS AND STUDENT SELF-HELP The University is in possession of funds from which loans are made to deserving students in need of such assistance. An account of these loans is given in the General Catalogue. Inquiries concerning them should be addressed to the Bursar. Opportunities for obtaining remunerative employment are afforded to students who are desirous by this means of partially paying their way through the University. It is difficult to give definite assurance of employment to a student before he reaches the University, but it may be stated that any student with sufficient resources to carry him through the first half of the session can be reasonably sure of obtaining work which will help defray his expenses for the rest of the academic year. Information as to employment may be obtained from the Director, Bureau of Student Self-Help, Box 1487, University, Virginia. EXAMINATIONS AND REPORTS Oral Examinations are held at the beginning of each lecture hour on the topics of the preceding lecture. Written test papers are set monthly, or at such interval as the professor may appoint. Absences from lecture except by reason of sickness are not excused without a written leave from the Dean. Class standing is determined on the basis of the oral examinations and the written tests. Absence from the latter or failure to answer incurs a 0 grade. Absences from laboratory periods, however caused, must be made up by special private arrangement with the instructor. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING Written Examinations are held at the end of each term on the entire work of that term. The result of examination combined with the student's class-standing gives his term-grade. The pass-mark is 75 per cent. Absence from the written term examination incurs a 0 term-grade, which may not be removed except by the passage of a special written examination on the work of that term. Such special examinations are granted only upon presentation of a written certificate from a reputable physician that the student by reason of sickness on the day of the regular examination was unable to attend. Regular Reports are sent out at the end of every term to the student's parent or guardian. These state for each course followed the term-grade. Further comment may be added by the Dean or the professor, if it appears probable that such comment would be helpful to the student. Parents are urged to examine these reports carefully and to exert such parental influence as may seem needed to establish and confirm the student in habits of industry and order. Special Reports are sent to parents at the end of each month for students delinquent in attendance or studiousness and for delinquents only. When a student is making steady progress and showing due diligence in his work, only the regular reports are sent. The receipt of a special report is evidence that, in the judgment of the faculty, prompt and pointed parental admonition is urgently needed. If in any class in the Department of Engineering a student fails to make satisfactory progress, he is first admonished by the professor in charge. In default of prompt and permanent improvement, he is next formally warned by the Dean. If due amendment is then not immediately effected, the student's name is dropped from the rolls of the Department, on the ground that he is not accomplishing the purposes for which he should have entered upon a University course of study. REGULATIONS The following regulations, adopted to define the policy of the faculty, are published for the information and guidance of the students: 1. Practice-courses as well as lecture-courses must be conducted under the Honor System. The student who submits any work to be graded is considered to submit it under pledge. 2. When the lecture-course and the associated practice-course are given in the same term of the same year, no student will be admitted to examination on the lecture-course until he has completed at least three-fourths of the practice-course. 3. No student will be admitted to any practice-course unless he is at the same time pursuing the associated lecture-course, or has already received credit for the same. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING 4. No student will be admitted to the graduating examination on a lecture-course unless he has been present at more than half the lectures in that course. 5. In the technical courses in Engineering (i. e., courses not given in the College) term-grades shall not be averaged; except that the term-grades for Freshmen Applied Mathematics may be averaged for the first-year men only, provided no mark is below 65, and term-grades in Freshman English, Freshman Mathematics, Sophomore Mathematics, and Sophomore Physics may be averaged, provided a grade of 75 or higher be made in the third term of the course with no grade below 65 in the first and second terms of the course. 6. The pass-mark in every course is 75. Class standing and written examination are combined for the term-grade in such proportions as the several professors may determine. 7. No student who fails to make 75 on term-grade shall be granted another examination on the course until he has again attended lectures on that course. 8. Special examinations are not given except by reason of sickness on the day of examination, attested by the written certificate of a reputable physician, or for other like providential causes. In every case they must be validated by special vote of the faculty. 9. Any engineering student who fails to attain a passing grade of 75 on at least 9 term-hours will be placed on probation for the following term, probation to continue until at least 9 term-hours are passed in one term. No engineering student shall remain on probation for more than three terms, whether consecutive or not, in his entire engineering course. If probation is imposed a fourth time the student shall be suspended. 10. Any engineering student on probation who fails to attain a passing grade of 75 on at least 6 term-hours and whose average grade on all courses taken is less than 65 will be suspended. Any engineering student who passes less than 6 term-hours and whose average grade on all courses taken is less than 65 will be suspended. Suspension during a session continues for the remainder of the regular session. Suspension imposed at the end of a session holds for the whole of a subsequent session, except that such suspension may be absolved by the successful completion of prescribed work in the Summer Quarter. No engineering student suspended for a second time shall re-enter the department. 11. The Dean's List.âA student, who, in any session, passes on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 18 session-hours, with an average grade on all courses of not less than 82 per cent, will be placed on the Dean's list. A student, who, in any session, passes on all courses taken aggregating not less than 18 session-hours, but who does not average 82 per cent, and who, in any subsequent term, passes on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 18 term-hours, with an average grade on all 18 term-hours DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING of not less than 82 per cent will be placed on the Dean's List. A student will be automatically dropped from the Dean's List, if, in any term, he does not pass on all courses taken, aggregating not less than 18 term-hours, with an average grade on all courses of not less than 82 per cent. A student dropped from the Dean's List will be again placed on it if he meets the above mentioned standard for a term. A student on the Dean's List is not subject to the regulations limiting the issuance of leaves of absence from the University, nor does absence from any class entail on such student any penalty, affecting class standing, imposed for absence alone. Students on the Dean's List must attend all laboratory classes and must perform all written problem work and take all written quizzes under the same conditions as all other students. DRAFTING ROOMS The Drafting Rooms are abundantly lighted and are provided with solidly constructed tables with locked drawers for instruments and materials. Each student is assigned to a table and has a drawer for his exclusive use. The regular Drawing Classes execute each one plate a week under the supervision of the Instructors in Drawing. The more advanced students have such additional drawings assigned by their respective professors as are needed for the full development of the courses of study. Careful attention is given to the training of the students in free-hand lettering, in the conventional signs of mechanical drawing, in the proper layout of drawings, and in neat and accurate execution. Exercises are required also in tracing and in blue-printing, the rooms for which are conveniently arranged and in close contiguity to the drafting rooms. A vertical blue-printing machine with arc lamp, complete with trays, has recently been procured and installed. While, however, technical dexterity is demanded, the graphical method is taught and used primarily as an indispensable instrument of research, the thoughtful mastery of which is essential for the instructed Engineer. The construction and theory of the Polar Planimeter, the Slide Rule, and the Pantograph are carefully taught, and the student is trained in the practical use of these appliances for the rapid and accurate production of estimates and copies from finished drawings. EXPERIMENTAL ENGINEERING LABORATORIES Road Materials Laboratory.âThe apparatus for tests of non-bituminous road materials includes a two-cylinder Deval abrasion machine, a ball mill, a moulding press for briquettes of rock dust, a Page impact cementation tester, a Page impact toughness tester, a rock crusher and a Purdue brick rattler. This outfit the University owes to the generous aid of the late Dr. Logan Waller Page. In addition, the Department has acquired a 40,000-pound compression tester, a diamond core drill, a diamond rock saw, a grinding lap, a Westphal balance, specific gravity apparatus, and a complete set of sieves.

For hydraulic surveys a hook gauge and a current meter are provided. All students are instructed in the theory and adjustments of the field instruments and in their practical use in the field. They are also required to make up their field-books in standard forms; to reduce their surveys and execute all the necessary profiles, plans and maps; and to determine lengths, areas, and volumes both from the maps and from the original notes. Polar planimeters are provided for facilitating such estimates, and a pantograph for making reduced copies of finished drawings. A set of Beggs' Deformeter apparatus is available for use in the work of Bridge Design. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING LABORATORY The Scott Laboratory of Electrical Engineering.âThis laboratory was initially equipped and endowed by Mrs. Frances Branch Scott, of Richmond, Va., as a memorial to her late son, an alumnus of this University. During the year 1910 the equipment was substantially increased through the generosity of the Hon. Charles R. Crane, of Chicago, Ill., a friend of the University. Substantial additions of machines, measuring instruments, control apparatus, and auxiliaries are being made regularly in order to keep the equipment in the best order for laboratory work. In addition to a supply from the University Power Plant the laboratory is furnished from the Virginia Public Service Company through a synchronous motor driving an alternator and three-wire direct current generator, with two exciters, all on a common shaft. A complete three-panel switchboard for the control of this set is equipped with full sets of instruments and controls including a voltage regulator for the alternating current generator. Universal plug and receptacle-connections facilitate the setting up of all experimental combinations. For the machine testing there are available several direct-current motor generator sets with automatic push-button start and stop control complete, numerous direct current motors and generators, series, shunt and compound; high-voltage direct current generator set; steam-turbine-driven three-phase alternator with exciter and control switchboard; two experimental test sets for alternating current single or polyphase generator operation with modern switchboard control panel and driving motor with automatic start, stop, and reverse equipment; single-phase induction motor; single-phase repulsion-induction motor; two- and three-phase induction motors; three-phase induction-motor set for concatenation tests; induction generator; double-current generator; several pairs of constant potential transformers; constant-current transformer; polyphase transformer; mercury arc rectifier set; frequency changer; arc welding set; Fynn-Weichsel synchronous-induction motor; a number of different types of fractional horse-power motors both D. C. and A. C.; Prony brakes for all motors; variable resistances; variable inductances and capacities; current and potential transformers; recording instruments; meters for measuring frequency, power factor and indicators of synchronism and grounded circuits. A complete three-element oscillograph set with all accessories is available. Two telephone central-office ringer and signal sets, representative pieces of modern telephone quipment, and a 100-watt radio broadcast transmitter are installed. A complete artificial transmission line with oscillator, bridge, vacuum-tube ammeter-voltmeter and auxiliary equipment is available for communication tests. In addition to full sets of electric meters with the appliances for testing and calibrating them, galvanometers of the best modern types, standard cells and resistances, standard condensers, and other pieces of apparatus for minor tests, this laboratory contains numerous pieces of the very best construction. Such are the Wolff potentiometer, the Siemens and Halske Thomson double bridge, the Koepsel permeameter, the Station photometer with LummerBrodhun screen, Macbeth illuminometer, the Carey-Foster bridge and others. DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING BUILDINGS The buildings devoted wholly or in part to the work of the Department of Engineering are the following: The Mechanical Laboratory is the main seat of the instruction in technical studies. It is 180 by 70 feet and contains on the main floor the Dean's office and the offices of three other professors; and three lecture-rooms. Above are two offices, a reading room for students, and blue-print and photographic rooms. Below on the ground floor are an office and classroom, the electrical laboratories, the testing laboratories, apparatus and storerooms, and the student's lavatory. In order to more adequately care for increased numbers this building has undergone a considerable rearrangement during recent years. Wood and machine shop equipment has been entirely removed from the building, as well as the facilities for Drawing. This change made available much needed classroom space and allowed the electrical laboratories to be expanded. Incident to the changes new cement floors were constructed for the Road Materials Testing Laboratory, the main testing Laboratory and the main hall. A new high-pressure steam line from the Power House was also installed. The Drawing Room is temporarily housed in the sub-basement of Cabell Hall which has been fitted for drawing. The room accommodates about 100 men, each man having his individual drawing desk. The Power House is a single-story building 110 by 40 feet. It contains the University boiler plant and the electric lighting plant. The Boiler plant consists of two horizontal return-tubular boilers, each of 140 horsepower. The lighting plant consists of three electric generators directly connected to high-speed engines, the respective capacities being 25, 50, and 75 kilowatts. The whole plant is available for purposes of instruction, study and experiment. In addition to the University plants there are available by courtesy of the owners for purposes of inspection, study and tests such plants as the turbine station and railway and power substation of the Virginia Public Service Company, the water turbines and oil engine plant of the Charlottesville Woolen mills, and plants of the local ice companies and cold storage. The Geological Museum is 120 by 50 feet. It is a three-story building. The main floor is devoted to the very extensive geological collection of specimens, charts, relief maps, and so on. The gallery above contains an equally good collection of minerals and numerous models of typical crystallographic forms. The upper floor contains the lecture-rooms and the laboratories of Economic Geology. In the basement are stored subsidiary collections and new material accumulated in more recent geological surveys. The Physical Laboratory faces the Mechanical Laboratory on the opposite side of the quadrangle, and has almost the same proportions. The main floor contains the lecture-room, the professors' offices, the laboratory of experimental physics, and the storeroom for the very large collection of apparatus used in the lectures. On the ground floor is the laboratory of theoretical electricity, the storage battery room, a well-equipped shop for the DEPARTMENT OF ENGINEERING repair and manufacture of apparatus, and smaller rooms for the work of graduate students. The new Chemical Laboratory was opened for use in September, 1917, In this fire-proof structure all the work in Chemistry is assembled. The floor area provided is about 45,000 square feet. The lecture-rooms seat classes of 300, 75 and 25 students. The laboratories assigned to General Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Qualitative Analysis, Quantitative Analysis, and Physical Chemistry contain 110, 60, 40, 30, and 20 desks. Altogether by dividing classes into sections, 600 students may be accommodated. Smaller private laboratories are provided for research workers. Large stock rooms communicating by elevators with the several floors contain ample stores of chemical supplies. The 5,000 volumes of books and bound sets of journals constituting the Departmental Library of Chemistry are so housed as to be accessible to both teachers and students.</field>

Mail addressed to Charlottesville is delayed in delivery. Historical.âAmong the original Schools contemplated in Mr. Jefferson's plan for the organization of the University of Virginia was "Law: Municipal and Foreign, Embracing the General Principles, Theory and Practice of Jurisprudence, together with the Theory and Principles of Constitutional Government." Accordingly the School of Law was established in 1826, and has been an integral part of the University from its foundation. The aim of the Department of Law has been, from earliest days, to maintain a high standard as a requirement for graduationâthe degree being conferred only upon such students as have satisfactorily completed the prescribed course of study according to traditionally rigid standards. This policy has been uniformly enforced, and its wisdom has been vindicated by the high position which the graduates of the Law School are accustomed to attain at the bar and in public life. The course of instruction has been extended from time to time to conform to economic conditions and to meet the increasing demands of the profession. The Law School is a member of the Association of American Law Schools; is registered by the Regents of the University of the State of New Yorfk as meeting the requirements for admission to the bar in that State; and is on the approved list of the American Bar Association. Law School Building.âThe Law School has occupied since 1911 its own building, designated as Minor Hall, in honor of the late John B. Minor, whose distinguished service of fifty years as a professor in the Law School, the University thus commemorates. But due to increased numbers, both in the teaching force and in student enrolment, the Law School has in recent years found these quarters too limited for its purposes. This situation will be relieved at the opening of the session of 1932-33, when the Law School will ocupy its new and more commodious quarters, Clark Hall, now in course of erection. It occupies the elevated site in rear of the dormitories known as D and E on Dawson's Row, now demolished. The Law School is indebted for the new building to the generosity of William Andrews Clark, Jr., of Los Angeles, California, a graduate of the Law School of 1899. The gift is a memorial to his late wife, Mabel Foster Clark, for whom the building is named. It will be a modern fireproof structure, with liberal and handsome provision for all the needs and conveniences of a modern law school. DEPARTMENT OF LAW Law Library.âThe Library contains more than twenty-five thousand volumes. Its financial resources, from appropriations by the Visitors, and from special endowments, make possible substantial additions annually The Library contains the English Reports, practically complete, from and including the Year Books to date; the Canadian and Australian Reports; the United States Supreme Court Reports; reports of all the American States in official or unofficial form; the National Reporter System, complete; selected and annotated reports, together with modern searchbooks in the form of general Digests, and the leading Encyclopedias, besides a large collection of textbooks, and bound volumes of law journals. Practically all the current American legal periodicals are received, and bound volumes of these are on the shelves. Virginia Law Review.âUnder the title of the Virginia Law Review, the undergraduate students of the Law School conduct a law journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence. Eight numbers are issued annually, from November to June, inclusive. The Review is now in its eighteenth volume. From its inception it has maintained a high standard of excellence, and a worthy rank among the leading law journals of the country. Adequate quarters adjoining the library are provided for the accommodation of the editorial and business staff. GENERAL INFORMATION The Session begins on the Thursday preceding the nineteenth of September, and continues for thirty-nine weeks, ending about June 15. The first three days of the session are given to registration, and all students, both old and new, are required during that time to place their names upon the books of the University and the rolls of their respective classes. Lecture courses begin on the Monday following, and absences will be recorded against any student not present, from the opening lecture of each course. Students entering after the first three days, without satisfactory excuse, will be charged a fee for registration. The session is divided into Three Terms. The first term ends December 21; the second, March 25; and the third, with the close of the session. Late Entrance.âStudents are advised that late entrance upon the work of any term is a serious hindrance to progress. The student who enters late must begin his work at the point to which the several courses have advanced at the time of his entrance; and credit for three years' attendance cannot be secured unless the student is in actual residence at least thirty weeks per session. No student may register for the work of the first term after October 15, nor for that of the second term after January 10ânor is registration in absentia permissible. When Students May Enter.âIt is highly desirable that students of any year, and particularly those of the first year, should enter upon the study of law at the beginning of the session. Where this was impossible, it was formerly the practice of the Law School to permit students to register at the beginning of the second term, in January, but not later, save in exceptional cases. This practice was then feasible, since new courses were begun at that time. With the session of 1931-1932, however, a number of indivisible DEPARTMENT OF LAW courses, some in each year, were extended over two or more terms. It is, therefore, no longer possible for candidates for the degree to enter at the beginning of the later term. In exceptional cases, qualified students who seek special courses, and who are not candidates for the degree, may be permitted to enter after the end of the first term. Fees and Expenses.âThe necessary expenses of a student in the Law School may be estimated at $700 per session of nine months. This minimum estimate includes all University and tuition fees, board, lodging, laundry and books. An average estimate would be $900 to $1,000 per session, reckoning living expenses at a somewhat higher figure. The University fee applicable to all law students (including those from Virginia) is $60; and the tuition fee for residents of Virginia is $175, for non-residents, $195; an athletic fee of $15 applies to all students. The total fees, therefore, for Virginia students are $250, and for the non-Virginians $270. Payment of Fees.âFees are payable one-third upon registration; one-third at the opening of the second term; and the remainder at the opening of the third term. Failure to make satisfactory arrangements therefor with the Bursar will lead to suspension of all University privileges. (See Regulation 2, post page 356.) Registration as Virginia Student.âIn order to be considered a Virginia student, it is necessary that the applicant's parents be domiciled in the State if he be under twenty-one years of age; or if he has attained his majority, that he himself be domiciled in the State; and that either his parents or the applicant for admission shall have been bona fide taxpayers in the State of Virginia for at least two years prior to said application. Three Years' Course.âThe course of study embraces three years of thirty-seven weeks each, exclusive of holidays. Residence for three years, with attendance of at least thirty weeks a year, exclusive of holidays, is essential to graduation. Plan of Instruction.âIn many of the courses instruction is through textbooks and lectures, supplemented in some instances by cases, while in other courses the case-book is used exclusivelyâeach professor having full liberty of adopting his own methods. The daily oral quiz has long been a marked and, as experience has proved, a valuable feature of the system of instruction. This oral quiz is supplemented by frequent written tests, the results of which are carefully recorded, and, in the professor's discretion, are considered in estimating the final grade of the student. Practical Work.âIn the procedural courses and in Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, special stress is laid upon practical work. In the course on Legal Bibliography and Brief Making, an intimate acquaintance with law books and skill in their use are secured by lectures and demonstrations three times a week during the first term of the first year, accompanied by the assignment of practical work in the library, on which numerous oral and written tests are held; and in the third year briefs on assigned topics and according to rigorous standards are required. Much practical work is done in the headnoting of cases on scientific principles. DEPARTMENT OF LAW The Law Clubs.âThere are usually six or more Law Clubs functioning actively in the life of the Law School. Membership in the Law Clubs is optional but students are strongly advised to participate in this work as it affords training in the use of the library, in the preparation of briefs, and in the presentation of oral argument. Required for Graduation.âThe degree of Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) is conferred upon such students as have satisfied the entrance requirements; have attended three full sessions of the Law School; have successfully passed the required examinations, with satisfactory performance of assigned practical work, and have maintained a satisfactory record for ethical conceptions and honorable conduct such as should characterize a prospective member of the legal profession. More specifically, the candidate for graduation must have completed all the obligatory courses (see Outline of Courses, infra), and elective courses, aggregating at least 21 term-hours. A term-hour represents one lecture period per week throughout one of the three terms into which the session is divided. Degree with Final Honors.âA student who is without substantial deficiency in the work of the first two years may, when registering for his third year, seek to qualify for the award of the degree with Final Honors upon the conditions set forth on page 359, infra. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS Suggestions as to Preliminary Education.âProspective law students, and their parents or guardians, are admonished that the law is peculiarly an intellectual profession, and for its successful prosecution, whether in a law school or in the broader fields of professional life, demands a well-trained mind. If it be true that untrained recruits, in rare instances, under diligent and persistent effort, develop into successful practitioners after entrance upon the practice, such exceptional cases but serve to illustrate the rule that out of a given number of candidates entering upon the study of law, those with sound preliminary training will have incomparably the advantage, while those without such training are likely never to rise above mediocrity in their profession. The experience of all law teachers is that the standing and progress of law students may, in general, be measured by their academic preparation. Moreover, sound academic training tends to develop and to refine the ethical sense so necessary to an honorable career at the bar. It is this consideration that has been, in large measure, the motive of the Association of American Law Schools, and of the national and State bar associations of America, to stress, as these have been doing for some years, the need of a higher educational standard for students proposing to enter upon the study of the law. Students are therefore urged not to begin their legal studies before completion of an academic course approximating that required for a baccalaureate degree. So high a standard, however, is not as yet exacted as a condition of entrance into the Law School. These conditions are shown in the following sections. DEPARTMENT OF LAW 1. Regular Students.âCandidates for the degree of Bachelor of Laws must have attained the age of nineteen years (counting to the nearest birthday) before entering the department, must produce a certificate of good character from the school or college last attended, or from other satisfactory source, and must conform to the general requirements following: Entrance Credits.âIn addition to the completion of an approved high school course of four years, or its equivalent, the candidate must present evidence that for at least two years he has pursued, as a resident, in a standard college, courses acceptable toward a baccalaureate degree, of which he must have successfully completed at least 30 session-hours, or 60 semester-hours. A session-hour is one hour a week of recitation, or two hours a week of laboratory work, through the college year. Credit will be given for completed courses only. A completed course is one for which the student is entitled to final credit toward a baccalaureate degree from the institution in which the work was done, without further pursuit of that course. Applications for Admission.âApplications for admission must be submitted upon forms which will be supplied by the Dean of the Law School. Such applications, with satisfactory evidence of the required entrance credits, should be filed in the Dean's office not later than September 1. An applicant for admission from outside Virginia may be required to supplement his application by an interview with representatives of the University. Any applicant whose pre-law college record is not considered satisfactory by the Committee on Admissions, from the standpoint of scholarship, may be denied admission, or admitted only on Probation, even though such applicant has completed the entrance credits required. Courses Not Acceptable for Admission.âNotice is given that beginning with the session of 1932-1933, courses in Art, Music, Education, Physical Training or Military Training will not be acceptable for admission to the Law School. Recommended Pre-Law Courses.âThe following subjects are recommended as desirable pre-law courses: English, Latin, a Modern Foreign Language, History, a Natural Science, Mathematics, Political Science, Accounting, Economics, Psychology, Philosophy, and Public Speaking. Evidence of the Required High School and College Work.âEvidence of the required entrance credits must be in the form of a certificate, properly authenticated by the Registrar or other authorized official of the institution at which the college work was done. Such certificate must indicate, in addition to the high school units offered for admission, the college courses completed, the grades received, the time devoted to each course, and the credit, in session- or semester-hours, at which each such course is valued toward a baccalaureate degree. No Conditioned Students.âCandidates for admission who have not completed the required 30 session-hours will not be admitted with the privilege of making up the deficiency. DEPARTMENT OF LAW No Advanced Standing.âNo advanced standing or other credit is given for attendance at another law school, nor for time spent in private reading. The candidate for graduation must spend three years in residence, pursue all required courses in the curriculum, and pass all regular examinations therein.* * After considerable experimentation with the prevailing custom of giving credit for work done in other law schools, this rule was adopted in 1904. From the beginning the practical results were so satisfactory that it has become a firmly established policy of the Law School. The rule does not rest on an assumed superiority of curriculum or methods, but on the practical impossibility of dovetailing the parts of two differently arranged curricula. It also avoids certain evils usually accompanying the advanced standing privilege. For an account of the origin of the privilege of advanced standing, and the undesirable results, reference is made to Bulletin Number Fifteen (1921, p. 168) of The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Admission of Women.âWith the beginning of the session of 1920-1921, women were admitted to the Law School for the first time. The conditions of their admission are the same as in the case of male applicants. 2. Special Students.âA limited number of applicants who are at least 23 years old and who present proper evidence of good character and of needful maturity and training, though unable to fulfil the foregoing entrance requirements, may, by special action of the Law Faculty, and only in exceptional cases, be admitted as special students, and not as candidates for the degree.â  â  The limitation of the number of special students admitted conforms to the recommendation of the American Bar Association. The applicant for admission as a special student is required to make written application to the Dean of the Law School, on a blank furnished for the purpose, with detailed information as to his age, general habits, his educational and business experience, and his general fitness to undertake the study of law, with a statement of reasons why he was unable to qualify as a regular student. Such application, together with such testimonials as may be required, must be filed with the Dean not later than September 1 of the year in which the applicant desires to enter. Every such applicant for admission as a special student must (if required) pass a satisfactory examination, to be held at the University during the registration days of the session. The examination, which will be conducted by a committee of the Law Faculty, may include the subjects of English, American and English History, and Civil Government. SCHOLARSHIPS AND AWARDS IN THE LAW SCHOOL The Louis Bennett Scholarship, with a yearly income of $200. Founded in 1920 by Mrs. Sallie Maxwell Bennett in memory of her husband, Hon. Louis Bennett, '71, of Weston, W. Va. The holder must be a deserving young man, preference being given to students from West Virginia. In case there are no qualified applicants from West Virginia the award is made to a student from Virginia. The Virginia Law Review Scholarship, with an income of $200. Founded in 1914. Annually awarded to the Editor-in-Chief of the Virginia Law Review. The William E. Homes Scholarship, with a yearly income of $55. Founded in 1920 upon the bequest of Peter P. Homes, '13, in honor of his father, Judge William E. Homes, '69, of Boydton, Virginia. Annually awarded to the Notes Editor of the Virginia Law Review. DEPARTMENT OF LAW The Daniel Harmon Scholarship, entitling the holder to the remission of the tuition and University fees. Founded in 1912 "in consideration of the distinguished service rendered by Daniel Harmon, '82, as a member of the Board of Visitors." The holder must be "a young Virginian of ability, character, and need." A number of duPont Scholarships are available to students in the Department of Law. These scholarships are awarded to incoming students as well as to other students in the Department of Law. The awards will be made on the basis of character, scholarship and need. The amount of the award is subject to the discretion of the Law Faculty at the time the award is made, the normal amount being $250. For further information with regard to scholarships see the General Catalogue, or apply to the Office of the Dean of the Department of Law. The Samuel Baker Woods, Jr., Memorial Award, with a yearly income of $500. Established in 1930 by Forrest J. Hyde, Jr., '19, of New York City, as a memorial to the late Samuel Baker Woods, Jr., '08, of Charlottesville, Virginia. Under the terms of the donation the award is made at the close of each session to the law student who is a candidate for graduation the following year, and whose scholarship, character, personality, activities in the affairs of the Law School, and promise of efficiency, have, in the opinion of the Law Faculty, entitled him to special recognition above his fellows. The Charles Minor Blackford Prize was established through the liberality of the late Mrs. Susan Colston Blackford, of Lynchburg, Va., in memory of her husband, the late Charles Minor Blackford, a distinguished alumnus of the Law School. The prize consists of $50 in cash, and is awarded each year to a student of the Law School for the best essay on some legal or sociological subject. THE WILLIAM H. WHITE LECTURE FOUNDATION This Foundation was established in 1922 by Mrs. Emma Gray White, widow, Mrs. Emma Gray Trigg, daughter, and W. H. Landon White and William H. White, Jr., sons, of the late William H. White, a distinguished alumnus and for many years a Visitor of the University. The conditions require that the income be used in securing each session the delivery before the Law School of a series of lectures, preferably not less than three in number, by a jurist or publicist, especially distinguished in some branch of jurisprudence, domestic, international, or foreign; and that the lecturer present some fresh or unfamiliar aspect of his subject. Each series of lectures shall possess such unity that they may be published in book form; and the copyright thereof shall vest in the Foundation. OUTLINE OF COURSES The table of courses and lecture schedule, as outlined on the following pages, contemplate an average of about fifteen lecture periods (of one hour each) per week.

M. Corporate Finance DEPARTMENT OF LAW GENERAL REGULATIONS 1. Registration Generally.âStudents are required to register in advance at the office of (1) The Dean of the Law School; (2) The Bursar; and (3) The University Registrar, for every course taken. Registration is not complete until fees have been paid or proper arrangement for payment made with the Bursar. 2. Suspension for Non-Payment of Fees.âA student who is in default in the payment of fees and has so remained for fifteen days will be suspended, and deprived of all privileges of the Law School, until his financial relations with the University have been arranged satisfactorily with the Bursar. 3. Delayed Registration.âStudents are not permitted to delay registration through carelessness or for inadequate reasons. Any student, new or old, who fails without good cause, to present himself for registration during the first three days of the session, and between the hours of nine A. M. and one-thirty P. M. on the first week-day after the Christmas Recess, will be charged a special registration fee of five dollars. 4. Minimum for Which Students May Register.âNo student, without special permission, and for good cause, may register for less than a full year's work as scheduled. 5. Exchange or Omission of Courses.âAfter registration no course may be exchanged or omitted except on the approval of the professor in charge and of the Dean. 6. Late Entrance into Classes.âNo credit is given for the completion of any course upon which the student has entered after 50 per cent. of the lectures thereon in any term have been delivered. See requirements for Graduation, ante, p. 350. 7. Courses Extending Through More Than One Term of the Session.â a. Real Property I and Real Property II are so far regarded as separate courses that one may be passed, and credited, and the other failed. They are so far regarded as a single course that both may be absolved by attaining, in the same session, grades which average the passing grade. b. All other courses extending through more than one term will be credited only in their entirety, each as a single course. Regular examinations will be held, however, at the end of each term during which such a course is given, and will be reported to the Dean's Office, for disciplinary purposes, but the final grade for the entire course will be based upon the several term examinations, with the usual adjustments for attendance, written exercises and recitations. The last examination in such a course may cover the entire subject. 8. First-Year Students.âFailure on the part of any first-year student, without just cause, to attain, for the first term, an average examination grade of 80 per cent. will place such student on probation (see Regulation 11) for the remainder of the session, and the student and his parent or guardian will be so notified. Unless marked improvement in the character of his work is indicated at the end of the second term, his resignation may be required. DEPARTMENT OF LAW 9. Carrying Over Uncompleted Work From the First Year.âSubject to regulations below, students who have been found deficient in two or more courses prescribed for the first year may be re-admitted on probation (see Regulation 11). Where the Law Faculty deems the deficiency serious enough the student must repeat the lectures in the courses in which he is deficient. No optional attendance is permissible in such cases, and only such a limited amount of new work may be taken as will not conflict with the previously incomplete work. 10. Carrying Over Uncompleted Work From the Second Year.âA candidate for the degree who has proved deficient in one or more subjects required in the second year must repeat such courses without privileges in optional attendance, or otherwise, and may be on probation in any term during which he is repeating a second-year course. 11. Probation.âStudents on probation are not entitled to leaves of absence except for imperative cause, nor are they permitted to become members or officials of athletic, musical, debating or other student organizations which publicly represent the University. Any student on probation may be required to resign unless his work indicates a marked improvement. 12. Conditions of Readmission.âA student who, without satisfactory cause, has not attained for the session, on his examinations, credit for courses comprising in the aggregate at least 325 lecture periods, will be excluded from the Law School the following session, but may be permitted to return, on conditions, the next session thereafter. In this connection, attention is called to Regulation 9 foregoing. 13. Invalids.âStudents whose condition of health is too precarious to permit regular attendance upon lectures, but not serious enough to admit them as patients of the hospital, will be required to withdraw from the University until able to resume their regular work. 14. Optional Attendance.âA student who has attended the required lectures on any subject, required in the first year, but has failed on the examination, may, with the approval of the Dean, secure optional attendance on such subject the following session, to the extent necessitated by actual conflict in schedule with the regular courses of the second year, but subject to Regulation 9. 15. Advanced WorkâStudents are not permitted to anticipate the courses of a subsequent year, without urgent reasons satisfactory to the Dean. 16. General Requirements.âStudents of the Law School are required to attend all regular exercises of the classes of which they are members, and to perform all the work assigned, including quizzes and examinations, unless excused for good cause. 17. Absence From Lectures.âA careful record is kept of the absences from lectures and omission of prescribed work. Such absences, unexcused, render the student liable to be disciplined and detract from his class or examination grade. 18. "Dean's List."âAn average examination grade of 90 per cent. for the first two years will entitle the student to a place on the "Dean's List," DEPARTMENT OF LAW which carries with it special privileges with respect to absences from lectures. The privilege will not exempt students from required practical work, nor from review quizzes. The Dean may revoke the privilege if abused. 19. Extra-Curriculum ActivitiesâReports to the Dean.âStudents of the Law School who propose to become members or officials of athletic, musical, debating or other student organizations which publicly represent the University, or who propose to devote a material portion of their time to work outside the Law School, are required to report their names and proposed activities at the Dean's office for official approval. In no case will such approval be given to a student on probation. 20. Law Students Taking College Courses.âA Law Student, under special circumstances, with the permission of the Dean, may register in the College of Arts and Sciences for a course not exceeding three hours a week. 21. Special Examinations. (Subject to Regulation 24 below.)âNo special examinations are granted, save in case of sickness on the day of examination (attested by physician's certificate), or for other imperative cause approved by the Law Faculty. In no case will such examination be granted unless prompt application be made therefor. 22. Re-Examinations.âNo re-examinations are granted, except under conditions stated in Regulations 14 and 23. 23. Third-Year StudentsâIncomplete Work.âA candidate for the degree who at the end of his third year is found deficient in one or more subjects, may return the following session and, without further attendance upon lectures, stand the regular examinations on such of his uncompleted subjects as the Dean and the professor or professors in charge may approve. But this privilege may be exercised but onceâthat is to say, after a second failure the candidate must take the lectures over again, on the subject or subjects on which he has for a second time proved deficient. In exceptional cases and for good cause this privilege may be extended to the student of any year. See Regulation 14. 24. The Same.âStudents in the category mentioned in the foregoing regulation who return for a regular examination as mentioned, and who reside 250 miles from the University, may be granted the privilege of standing one or more special examinations in incompleted courses scheduled for a later term. The purpose of this provision is to avoid the expense of several return trips. 25. Examinations in absentia.âStudents entitled to one or more examinations under Regulation 23, and who reside more than 300 miles from the University, may, in the discretion of the Dean and of the professor or professors in charge, be allowed the privilege of standing such examination or examinations in absentia under approved supervision. 26. Examination Fees.âThe fee for standing such examinations as are mentioned in the last three preceding regulations is $5 for each examination taken. Students, who, under such circumstances, return for further lectures, DEPARTMENT OF LAW and who have paid full matriculation and tuition fees for three years, are required to pay a matriculation fee in proportion to the amount of work taken plus $5 for each course. There is no charge for special examinations granted for imperative cause, under Regulation 21. 27. Elective Courses Required for Degree.âIn addition to the satisfactory completion of all required work a candidate for the degree must offer credits of not less than 21 term-hours to be chosen by the student from the elective courses offered in the third year. 28. Application for Degree.âCandidates for graduation are required to file a written application with the Dean, not later than November 15 of their third year, indicating the courses completed, together with a schedule of the courses to be pursued during their final year. Blanks for this purpose will be supplied at the Dean's office. 29. Graduation with Final Honors.âA candidate who is without substantial deficiency in the work of the first two years may apply (See Regulation 28) for the award of the degree with Final Honors, by offering credits for elective courses totaling at least 10 term-hours, in addition to the 21 term-hours of elective courses mentioned in Regulation 27. The degree of Bachelor of Laws with Final Honors may be conferred upon any applicant who has completed all the prerequisite work, with an average grade of at least 90 per cent. on the courses offered in his third year, but subject to such special oral or written examinations as the Law Faculty may prescribe in respect to each such application. 30. Required Withdrawal.âThe right is reserved to require the withdrawal of any student who, in the opinion of the faculty, is not profiting nor likely to profit by the instruction offered; or whose neglect or irregular performance of required duties, after admonition, indicates indifference or contumacy; or whose character or habits are a menace to the good order of the Law School. 31. Honor System.âAll written tests and examinations are conducted under the Honor System.</field>

For other information, address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. The session of 1932-33 opens on September 15. The registration days are September 15-17. A fee is required for delayed registration. ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS The requirement for admission to the first year of the Department of Medicine is a four-year high-school education or its full equivalent, and two years of work in a college of arts and sciences approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association, as follows: I. High School Requirements The following are the minimum high school requirements of the American Medical Association and the Association of American Medical Colleges and must be satisfied for admission to all Class A medical schools. Students entering the College of the University of Virginia for their premedical college work must also DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE satisfy the regular entrance requirements for admission to the college. (See General Catalogue.) These differ from the requirements stated below only in that 2Â½ units of Mathematics (1Â½ in Algebra and 1 in Plane Geometry) are required. (a) For admission to the two-year premedical college course, students shall have completed a four-year course of at least 15 units in a standard accredited high school or other institution of standard secondary school grade, or have the equivalent as demonstrated by examinations conducted by the College Entrance Examination Board or by the authorized examiner of a standard college or university which has been approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. (b) Credit for admission to the premedical college course may be granted for the subjects shown in the following list and for any other subject counted by a standard accredited high school as part of the requirements for its diploma, provided that at least 11 units must be offered in groups I-V: Group I. English. (3 units required) Literature and Composition. Group II. Foreign Languages. (2 units required, both of which must be in the same language) Latin, Greek, French, German, Spanish, Italian, or other modern foreign language. Group III. Mathematics. (2 units required) Elementary Algebra, Advanced Algebra, Plane Geometry, Solid Geometry, Trigonometry. Group IV. History. (1 unit required) Ancient History, Medieval and Modern History, English History, American History, Civil Government. Group V. Science. Botany, ZoÃ¶logy, Chemistry, Physics, Physiography, Physiology, Astronomy, Geology. Group VI. Miscellaneous. Agriculture, Bookkeeping, Business Law, Commercial Geography, Domestic Science, Drawing, Freehand and Mechanical, Economics and Economic History, Manual Training, MusicâAppreciation or Harmony. A unit is the credit value of at least thirty-six weeks' work of four or five recitation periods per week, each recitation period to be not less than forty minutes. II. Premedical College Course The requirements given below are strictly minimum requirements. Premedical students are advised to take more than 30 session-hours of college work, either by spending an additional year in college or by taking 33 or 36 session-hours during their two years as college students. Entrance conditions of any kind whatsoever are absolutely prohibited and no substitution can be allowed for any required subject. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE In addition to the high-school work specified above, a candidate for admission to the Department of Medicine must present evidence of the completion in a manner satisfactory to this medical school of at least 30 session-hours of collegiate work in a college approved by the Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association. A session-hour is the credit value of one hour a week of lecture or recitation or two hours a week of laboratory work throughout a session of at least thirty-two weeks, exclusive of holidays. The subjects included in the 30 session-hours of college work should be in accordance with the following schedule: Required Subjects: Session-hours. General Inorganic Chemistry (a) 4 Organic Chemistry (b) 3 Physics (c) 4 Biology (d) 4 English Composition and Literature (e) 3 Other non-science subjects (f) 6 Subjects Strongly Urged: French or German, Advanced Botany or Advanced ZoÃ¶logy, Psychology, Advanced Algebra, Solid Geometry, and Trigonometry, additional courses in Chemistry. Other Suggested Electives: English (additional), Economics, History, Sociology, Political Science, Ethics, Logic, Mathematics, Latin, Greek, Italian, Spanish, Drawing. Credit Not Given for an Incomplete Course: Credit can be accepted only when the student has a clear record on the entire course; for example, if the course in General Physics is a 6 session-hour course consisting of 3 hours lecture and 6 hours laboratory weekly for three trimesters and the student passes on two trimesters but fails on the third, no credit for admission to medicine can be given for the portion of the subject passed, even though the credit value of this work is 4 session-hours. In all cases the student must have completed the entire subject for which he is registered. Deficiencies of this kind may however be made up by obtaining a clear record in the portion of the subject in which the failure has occurred, without repeating the entire course. Aptitude Tests: Applicants are strongly advised to take the Aptitude Tests of the Association of American Medical Colleges. Requirements in Individual Collegiate Subjects (a) General Inorganic Chemistry. 4 session-hours are required, including 2 session-hours of laboratory work. In the interpretation of this rule work in Qualitative Analysis may be counted as General Inorganic Chemistry. It is desirable that more time than this be given to General Chemistry and especially that either the elements of Physical Chemistry be included in a 6 session-hour course in this subject or a supplementary course in Elementary Physical Chemistry be taken. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE Students are also advised when their premedical work extends over more than two sessions to take at least 4 session-hours of Qualitative Analysis and 2 session-hours of Quantitative Analysis. (b) Organic Chemistry. 3 session-hours are required of which at least 1 must be laboratory work. 4 session-hours including 2 session-hours of laboratory work are recommended as giving better preparation in Organic Chemistry. (c) Physics. 4 session-hours required, of which at least 1 must be laboratory work. It is urged that this course be preceded by a course in Trigonometry and Solid Geometry. (d) Biology. 4 session-hours required, of which 2 must consist of laboratory work. The requirement may be satisfied by a course of 4 session-hours in General Biology or ZoÃ¶logy, or by courses of 2 session-hours each in ZoÃ¶logy and Botany, but not by Botany alone. Courses in Physiology and Hygiene, Sanitation, Bacteriology, Histology, and other similar work covered in the medical curriculum cannot be accepted as part of the premedical college requirements in Biology. (e) English Composition and Literature. The usual introductory college course of 3 session-hours, or its equivalent, is required. (f) Non-Science Subjects. Of the 30 session-hours required as the measurement of two years of college work, at least 9, including 3 session-hours of English, should be in subjects other than the physical, chemical, or biological sciences. Although not required for admission to the medical school, premedical students are strongly urged to acquire the basic knowledge of French or Germanâand preferably of both French and Germanâwhich will enable them with a little practice to read with ease the medical literature published in these languages. Apart from the cultural value of the study of a foreign language and the use which may be found for French and German in the study of medicine, a reading knowledge of one or both of these languages is required for certain desirable postgraduate scholarships and fellowships. When the student presents for admission to the premedical college course 2 units of high school work in either language, the usual 3 session-hour "second year" college course will amply give this basic knowledge. When he begins the study of the language in college, he should take at least 4, and preferably 5, session-hours in the language. College courses in Physical Education and in Military Training or Military Science will not be counted towards the 30 session-hours required for admission to medicine; nor will required courses in Bible and Biblical Literature be counted, unless the course has a credit value of at least 3 session-hours for one session. No entrance conditions whatever can be allowed nor can any substitutions be made for the required subjects. Premedical students in other colleges and universities who are considering the possibility of entering upon their medical studies in this University are urged to have the authorities of the University of Virginia pass officially upon their academic credit early in their DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE last premedical college year and in no case later than June 1, of that year. Deficiencies may be discovered in this way in time to remove them before the following September. Such students will incur no obligation to enter this medical school. The prohibition of entrance conditions in all Class A medical colleges makes it especially important for the student to be absolutely sure six months or more beforehand that the course he is taking will admit him to the study of medicine. Many deficiencies can be made up by work in summer schools. In planning two years of premedical college work students are advised to take English, Mathematics (Solid Geometry, Plane Trigonometry, and Advanced Algebra), Biology, and General Inorganic Chemistry the first year; and Organic Chemistry, Physics, Foreign Language, and one or more electives the second year. This arrangement of studies is advised because Mathematics should precede Physics and General Inorganic Chemistry must precede Organic Chemistry. Those who have to take 4 or more session-hours of college work in Foreign Language may find it advisable to take Foreign Language both years and take the Mathematics in a summer school following the first premedical college session. Admission with Advanced Standing.âStudents are admitted to advanced standing in the second and third years under the following conditions: 1. Satisfaction of the requirements for entrance into this department at the time of entrance of the class to which the applicant seeks admission. 2. The presentation of a certificate of honorable dismissal from the school last attended. 3. The presentation of the complete record of the student in the school previously attended, on blanks to be obtained from the Dean of the Department of Medicine. This record will be submitted to the action of the Faculty Committee on Advanced Standing, and the admission of the student, together with the terms of admission, will be determined by this committee. The Committee on Advanced Standing will not in general consider favorably applications which are not accompanied by a distinctly good record in the school previously attended. Only in case of illness or equivalent cause will it admit a student to a year in which he has failed elsewhere and then only when, in the judgment of his previous instructors, he would have succeeded but for his illness. Whenever a student is admitted to advanced standing he must take and pass the full work of the class to which he is admitted unless by permission of the Dean he substitutes for one or more of the regular courses of his class other courses of approximately the same credit value. Students are not received with advanced standing to the fourth-year class. Limitation of Numbers and Reservation of Places.âThe number of students in the first-year class is limited to sixty-five. Reservation of a place, if desired by the applicant, can be made beforehand on the conditions hereinafter described. At the time of registration, applicants will be registered in the order in which they present themselves, until all vacancies are filled. Applicants DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE who have not made reservations, as described below, are therefore advised to apply for registration at 9 o'clock of the first day of registration (September 15, 1932). Any applicant whose record has been endorsed by the Dean of the Department of Medicine as entitling him to admission to the class to which he seeks admittance, may at a specified time after June 25 of which he will be given due notice and before the registration period in September have a place reserved for him until 12:00 noon of the first day of registration by depositing with the Bursar the sum of $50.00 in part payment of the tuition fee. A reservation so made can be cancelled only in exceptional cases. In case a student who has obtained a reservation fails to register, the deposit of $50.00 will be forfeited to the University unless, in case of illness or equivalent cause, the Dean of the Department of Medicine directs that it be returned. By the deposit, under similar conditions, of the entire fees for the year a student may have a place reserved for him until 5 p. m. of the last day of registration. Women over twenty years of age are admitted to the medical department by satisfying the entrance requirements specified above. All women students must first register at the office of the Dean of Women, 20 East Lawn. FACILITIES FOR AND METHODS OF INSTRUCTION The new Medical Building recently completed contains modern well-equipped laboratories for the accommodation of the medical sciences. This building is connected by corridors and bridges with the hospital, thus bringing all departments of the Medical School into close physical association. The new arrangement necessitated extensive changes in certain portions of the hospital, involving especially the surgical suite, the X-ray suite and the out-patient quarters. It required also the erection of an enlarged laundry, a newer power plant, and dining halls for hospital staff and nurses. The Medical School Building consists of two wings connected by an inside pavilion, all five floors in height. The south wing houses on four successive floors the departments of biochemistry, pharmacology and materia medica, physiology, and histology and embryology. On the top floor are the experimental laboratories, quarters for experimental animals and a fireproof storage room for X-ray plates. The north wing gives accommodations on the ground floor for autopsy rooms, an embalming room, a media room, refrigeration, incineration and storage. The first floor houses half of the Out-Patient Department and the receiving room. On the second floor are the offices of administration, the museum and the library. On the third floor are the department of pathology and bacteriology, and two classrooms. The fourth floor contains a laboratory for neuro-anatomy. The connecting pavilion, or west wing, contains on the ground floor four student locker rooms, the electrical power room, a record storage room, and an amphitheatre. The latter is two floors in height and extends eastward into the open court between the north and south wings. On the first floor are a lecture room, a staff room, a record room, a drug room, and examining and sterilizing rooms. On the second floor are housed the department of clinical pathology DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE and a cardiac laboratory. The third floor has three laboratories for gross anatomy, a study room, a number of offices, and quarters for surgical pathology. On the top floor are accommodations for the department of public health and hygiene. These laboratories are all presided over by trained teachers, to whom teaching and investigation are primary considerations. The number of hours assigned to laboratory subjects is quite large and affords ample time for thorough study by the best methods. The student is brought into close contact with teachers who are both willing and able to guide him; he gains a very large part of his knowledge at first hand and by his own exertions, and thus acquires the habit of working out things for himself; he becomes self-reliant, a quality essential to the practice of his difficult profession. Trained in this manner, he acquires an understanding of the medical sciences and the ability to apply the facts of these sciences to the subsequent study of disease. For these reasons the great fundamental sciences receive the utmost consideration, constituting a large part of the work of the first two years. The methods of clinical instruction are based upon the belief that no clinical teaching is efficient which is not governed by essentially the same principles as those which govern the best laboratory teaching. This instruction is accordingly designed to enforce with the individual student a careful, thorough, face-to-face study of disease and its management. The facilities afforded by the University Hospital and Out-Patient Department are described on a subsequent page. In the Out-Patient Department and in the Hospital the student learns the methods of examining patients, of diagnosing their diseases, and of instituting rational treatment; and he learns these things in much the same way as he studied in the laboratory, that is to say, by doing them himself under the direction and criticism of the instructors. This practical training is accompanied by a systematic study of the various subjects by means of lectures, textbooks, and recitations. The student conducts a complete examination, records his observations in a scientific manner, makes a diagnosis, states his view as to the treatment indicated, and keeps a complete record of the case, all under the advice and criticism of the physician or surgeon in charge. He is expected to keep himself informed of the progress of the case throughout its course. If it is one requiring surgical treatment, he assists at the operation, and thus is able to follow all the procedures of the operator at close range. In addition, students make frequent visits to the wards with the attending physicians and surgeons, during which visits the nature, treatment, and progress of various cases are gone over in detail. The patients of the Blue Ridge Sanatorium afford additional material for clinical instruction. Since the number of students in each class is relatively small, it is clear that the department offers capable young men clinical advantages which are distinctly exceptional. At the meetings of the Medical Society of the University of Virginia reviews of important articles, clinical cases and results of original research are presented by the instructors and by invited guests. Graduate Instruction in the Department of Medicine was organized for the session 1929-30. The work is administered under the Department of Graduate Studies of the University. The courses of the regular medical curriculum DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE are credited as C courses; elective, special research and seminar courses are evaluated as D courses. During the current session eight graduate students are enrolled, one each in Anatomy, Surgery, Public Health and Hygiene, Biochemistry, Pharmacology, Physiology, Psychiatry, and Histology. Recent revision of the medical curriculum, involving chiefly reductions in the number of session-hours of required work and the establishment of elective and research courses in each of the major departments, makes possible a greatly enlarged scope of graduate instruction. Registrar's Records of Student's Work.âThe results of the work of each student are recorded in the Registrar's office in such manner as to show (1) the grade received on each course, (2) whether the student has or has not absolved the course and, if not, what is necessary to obtain a clear record and admit to dependent subjects, and (3) a valuation in "honor points" of the results of the work for each session. 1. The grade received on each course. These grades with their percentage equivalents are as follows: 1 + = 95-100 per cent 1 = 90- 94 per cent 2 = 85- 89 per cent 3 = 80- 84 per cent 4 = 70- 79 per cent 5 = below 70 per cent The passing grade is 3. A grade of 4 entitles the student to a condition, as explained below. A grade of 5 means a failure for the course. No passing grades are reported to the Registrar's office on didactic work unless the laboratory or clinical part of the course is completed in a satisfactory manner; nor are any grades reported when the student is deficient until the deficiency has been made up. 2. Whether the student has or has not absolved the course, and, if not, what is required to obtain a clear record and admit to dependent subjects. This is indicated in the following terms: Passed (P) indicates the satisfactory completion of the course and admits to all dependent subjects. Conditioned (C) means that to obtain a clear record on the course the student must pass a special examination. Failure to take or to pass this examination is equivalent to a record of "failed." The record "conditioned" is not given in fourth-year subjects, except in case of illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty. A student may be conditioned on any examination because of failure to maintain a reasonable standard of English composition. Deficient (D) indicates that part of the required laboratory or clinical work of the course has not been completed. Upon the satisfactory completion of this work within the time and in the manner prescribed by the professor in charge, the student receives the record "passed"; otherwise the record is "failed" on the entire course. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE Failed (F) indicates that the course must be repeated; except that when the laboratory or other practical work has been satisfactorily performed, the professor in charge may, at his discretion, excuse the student from repeating the same; and, by special vote of the faculty, the student may be granted optional attendance upon the course, in whole or in part. In general, a student who is repeating a course will be required to attend all the exercises of the course, and will not be excused from any exercise thereof because of schedule conflicts with more advanced work. Absence from a regular examination, when excused because of illness or equivalent cause gives a record of conditioned; if not excused, a record of failed. 3. A valuation of the general results of the work on each course and of the student's work for the entire session. Honor points. This is expressed in honor points. Each course is valued in the usual manner in terms of session-hours. An honor point (or simply a point) may be defined as the honor value of one-half session-hour of a course on which a grade of 2 has been received; the honor value becomes 2 for each half session-hour of a course on which 1 has been received and 2Â½ for each half session-hour on which a grade of 1+ has been received. Thus for each session-hour of a complete course: A grade of 3 gives no honor points. A grade of 2 gives 2 honor points. A grade of 1 gives 4 honor points. A grade of 1+ gives 5 honor points. A grade of 4 subtracts 2 honor points. A grade of 5 subtracts 4 honor points. No honor points are given on a course on which a condition or failure has been received at the time of the final examination on the course; except that, in case of illness or equivalent cause, the results of re-examination or of repetition of the courseâinstead of the record on the completion of the courseâmay be made the basis of estimating honor points. Students who receive on the entire curriculum of any one year of medical study, or its equivalent, a total of 50 honor points have optional attendance on all the didactic work of the next session. Special Rules Governing Advancement and Registration. I. At the close of the University in June, the status of the students shall be fixed for the next session, classification being made as follows: (a) Promoted; (b) Required to Withdraw; (c) Provisionally Promoted; and (d) Required to Repeat. (a) Promoted. This group shall be composed of all students who have satisfactorily completed the entire work of the year. (b) Required to Withdraw. This group shall include such students as are not deemed competent to continue their training in this school. The record requiring withdrawal, reckoned in session-hours, is as follows: For first-year studentsâ(1) Failures in 9 session-hours; (2) failures in 6 hours plus conditions in 6 hours. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE For second-year studentsâ(1) Failures in 10 hours; (2) failures in 8 hours plus conditions in 4 hours. For third-year studentsâ(1) Failures in 6Â½ hours; (2) failures in 4Â½ hours plus conditions in 4 hours. (c) Provisionally Promoted. This group shall include students who have incurred only such deficiencies as can with reasonable expectation be removed by the opening of the next session. The record entitling provisional promotion, reckoned in session-hours, must not be lower than the following: For first-year studentsâ(1) Failures in 6 session-hours; (2) failures in 4 hours plus conditions in 4 hours; (3) conditions in 10 hours. For second-year studentsâ(1) Failures in 7 hours; (2) failures in 6 hours plus conditions in 3 hours; (3) conditions in 11 hours. For third-year studentsâ(1) Failures in 4Â½ hours; (2) failures in 3 hours plus conditions in 3 hours; (3) conditions in 8 hours. (d) Required to Repeat. This group shall include all students not placed in groups a, b, and c. A student who is repeating must attend all exercises of the year, or courses, and pass the examinations, regardless of the grades previously made. II. Students, classified in June as "Required to Withdraw" or "Required to Repeat," shall not change their status by passing summer courses and (or) special examinations. III. A student who has been permitted to repeat a year, or prescribed courses, shall not be granted the privilege for a second time, i. e., he shall not spend more than five years in completing the requirements for graduation. IV. A student may not take any course, either in whole or in part (as explained under the above definition of failed) more than twice. A second record of failed on the same course involves withdrawal from the Department of Medicine. V. A clear record at the opening of the session in September on all subjects of the preceding year is required for advancement to the third and fourth years. VI. Summer courses taken for the removal of deficiencies must be approved by the professor in whose subjects the deficiencies were incurred; but it shall be the duty of the student concerned to provide the information on which to base the decision as to acceptability of courses; he must absolve the summer work and have an official record mailed directly from the institution to the professor at the University in charge of the subjects; and in addition he must report for the special examination at this University and make a passing grade therein. VII. Any student, who makes a grade below passing on any term's work or is in any way derelict in his duties, shall be warned, warned and placed on probation, or dismissed, according to the merits of the case. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE The value in session-hours of the courses of the first three years:â First Year Second Year Third Year Anatomy 1 6 Physiology 5 Clinical Diagnosis 1.5 Anatomy 2 2 Pathology 6 Medicine 4.0 Histology 4 Pharmacology 3 Surgery 4.0 Embryology 2 Materia Medica 2 Obstetrics 2.0 Biochemistry 4 Physical Diagnosis 1 Orthopedics 1.5 Bacteriology 3 Clinical Diagnosis 1 Pediatrics 2.0 Medicine 1 Urology 1.0 Surgery 1 Dermat. &amp; Syph. 1.5 Elective 2.0 Totals 21 Totals 20 Totals 19.5 Similar rules are enforced at practically all medical schools. It is exceedingly difficult for a student who has been dropped or not advanced at one school to secure admission to another. Compulsory withdrawal may therefore terminate a medical career. Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine, who have less than one full year's work to complete, may be required to take such additional work and to pass such additional examinations as the Medical Faculty may prescribe. This additional work may be selected from any of the courses given in the Department of Medicine, even when such prescribed courses have previously been taken and passed by the candidate in question. Certificates of Attendance.âStudents who attend the whole regular course of one or more of the four years are entitled to an official statement under the seal of the University, showing all courses for which the student was registered each year as a medical student and the record (see above under "Regulations") with the grade received on each course for which he was registered. These statements will also contain any special faculty votes affecting the student's registration in this school. In no case will the University give an official certificate of the completion of a part of a course. The professor in charge may, at his discretion, make a personal statement by letter to the head of the same department in another medical school of the work done by the student in his course; but he must at the same time clearly state that this letter does not give credit in this medical school. Requirements for Graduation.âThe degree of Doctor of Medicine is conferred by the University of Virginia upon candidates who have complied with the entrance requirements of this department; attended a regular medical course of four years of at least eight months each, the last two of which years must have been at this institution; and have satisfactorily completed all of the subjects included in the medical course. Examinations.âThese are in writing, accompanied in many subjects by individual practical examinations. Examinations may be held only during the regular examination periods at the end of each term or during the vacation DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE periods. No examinations may be given while regular class work is in progress; provided this rule is not to be interpreted to prohibit unannounced written tests or regular daily or weekly tests which count on the class standing of students. The regular examinations are held at stated periods during the session. In addition, examinations are held each year during the week immediately preceding the beginning of lectures. To the latter are admitted: 1. Students of the previous session who, from illness or other equivalent cause approved by the faculty, were unable to present themselves for examination in any particular subject at the regular time. 2. Students who at the regular examination in any first-, second-, or third-year subject of the preceding session have attained a grade less than 80 per cent., but as much as 70 per cent., on one or more subjects, as explained in a preceding paragraph. This does not apply to students who have been required to withdraw, or required to repeat, under the Special Rules Governing Advancement (pp. 370-371). 3. Certain applicants for advanced standing who are required to take examinations by the Committee on Advanced Standing. The usual period for special or conditioned examinations is in September during the week of registration; but such examinations may be scheduled, at the option of the professor in charge, for any other time, provided regular class work is not in progress and also provided all students entitled to take examinations agree to the change of date. For a special or condition examination held at any other time than that assigned for all students entitled thereto a fee of five dollars is charged. This fee must be paid to the Bursar before the examination is held. In all courses in which there is practical work, either in the laboratory or in the outpatient department or wards of the hospital, two records are returned to the Registrar's office for each student; one of these records is for the practical laboratory or clinical work in which the record is P(assed), D(eficient), or F(ailed), the other record is for the didactic work, including the final examinationsâin which case the record is P(assed), C(onditioned), D(eficient), or F(ailed), with the approximate percentage grade. To obtain a clear record on the course a student must have a record of P(assed) both on practical and on didactic work; in no case will the two grades be averaged. No record whatever is given on didactic work unless there is a record of P(assed) on practical work nor will any record be given on practical work until a clear record is obtained on didactic work; failure on practical work gives a record of F(ailed) on the entire course. The Fall Examinations for 1932-33 begin September 12 and close September 17. Students entitled to admission to these examinations will be informed of the date of examination by the Dean. Expenses.âThe fees for instruction are 1, the tuition fee; 2, the University fee which entitles the student to the use of the Library, Gymnasium, to medical attention, etc.; 3, the athletic fee; 4, special laboratory fees, as specified on following page: DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE First Year Second Year Third Year Fourth Year Tuition (Virginians) $250 00 $250 00 $250 00 $250 00 (Non-Virginians) 300 00 300 00 300 00 300 00 University fee 60 00 60 00 60 00 60 00 Athletic fee 15 00 15 00 15 00 15 00 Laboratory Fees: Biochemistry 10 00 Deposit in Biochemistry 10 00 Anatomy 1 and 2 17 50 Histology and Embryology 7 50 Physiology 10 00 Bacteriology 7 50 Pathology 5 00 Pharmacology 5 00 Clinical Diagnosis 5 00 5 00 Materia Medica 5 00 Total (Virginians) $377 50 $355 00 $330 00 $325 00 (Non-Virginians) 427 50 405 00 380 00 375 00 The minimum for necessary living expenses, including room, heat, light, furniture, service, board, books, and laundry, is estimated at $400. In the course in Biochemistry, a deposit of $10 is required to cover cost of breakage. A fee of $3.00 is required of all women students for the upkeep of the "Woman Students' Association Room." Each student in the Department of Medicine is required to provide himself with a satisfactory microscope. Voluntary Withdrawal from the University requires the written consent of the Dean of the University and the Dean of the Department in which the student is registered. When a permit is granted upon the University Physician's certificate that withdrawal is necessary on account of ill health, which must not be due to dissolute conduct, the fees are returned pro rata. Under no other circumstances will there be a return of fees. Combined Degrees in Arts (or Science) and Medicine.âStudents who have credit for the 48 session-hours of the group electives required in this University for the cultural baccalaureate degrees in arts and science may substitute for 12 session-hours of Electives-at-Large the first-year course in the Department of Medicine and receive the degree of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science at the end of the year. For further information, see the General Catalogue of the University. The University offers also the degree of Bachelor of Science in Medicine. This degree has been placed in charge of the Medical Faculty. It is awarded on the recommendation of the Medical Faculty after the completion of the second year of the medical curriculum to students who (1) present 33 session hours of acceptable work in premedical academic subjects (whether taken in the University or elsewhere) as specified below; (2) complete the first two years of the medical course in this University with grades in general higher DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE than the lowest passing grade; and (3) demonstrate by examination a reading knowledge of medical French and German. (1) Premedical Academic Subjects.âThese must include: Session-hours One year of College English 3 College Algebra, Solid Geometry, Plane Trigonometry 3 Physics, Chemistry, and Biology 24 With minimum requirements in each subject as follows: (a) General Chemistry (including in this term Analytical or Physical Chemistry) 6 (b) Organic Chemistry 4 (c) General Physics 4 (d) Biological Science 6 Elective in subjects other than Physics, Chemistry and Biology 3 (2) First two years of the Medical Curriculum, completed with a record of 30 honor points on first-year subjects and 40 honor points on second-year subjects. (3) Reading knowledge of Medical French and German.âThis will be tested by examination consisting of the translation of passages from textbooks of Anatomy and Histology, Biochemistry, Physiology, and Pathology. No specific college work is required although the equivalent of 3 session-hour college courses in each of these languages is desirable and may be offered as part of the premedical credits. The vocabulary of medical French and German may best be acquired by using foreign text-books, etc., in the above medical sciences as parallel reading, or as summer reading after the completion of the above subjects in the regular medical course. The William A. Herndon Scholarships are founded upon the bequest of Dr. Cumberland George Herndon, a graduate in medicine of this University. They are awarded by the Medical Faculty after a competitive examination held during the summer vacation preceding enrollment as a student in the Medical Department. Candidates must be unable to defray the expenses of their medical education and must signify their intention of entering the medical service of the army or navy of the United States. These scholarships carry a stipend of approximately $430. They continue for the four years of the medical course and are awarded whenever there is a vacancy. Two appointments were made in September, 1928; two will be made in September, 1932. Applications must be made not later than July 1 of the year of appointment. For information as to the examinations and other requirements, address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. The Richard Henry Whitehead Scholarships, founded by an anonymous donor in memory of Dr. Richard Henry Whitehead, Professor of Anatomy and Dean of the Department of Medicine, 1905-1916, are awarded to young men of promise who contemplate entering upon lines of medical work which DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE will advance medical knowledge either pure or applied. They are usually awarded only to students who have completed at least two years of the medical curriculum. There are three of these scholarships. New appointments will be made for the session 1932-33. For further information, address the Dean of the Department of Medicine. The Seven Society Alumni Medical Scholarship, established in 1926 by the Alumni of the Seven Society with an annual emolument of $350, is awarded to a student in the Department of Medicine upon nomination by the Dean of the Department of Medicine. The Virginia State Medical Scholarships, established in 1925 by the Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia. Two scholarships are awarded annually in the Department of Medicine, towards the close of the session, to the students from Virginia on the basis of rank and need, retroactive for the session. Tenure four years, conditioned upon maintenance of satisfactory scholastic record. Emolument, remission of tuition fee. The Doctor William Selden Memorial Scholarship in the Department of Medicine, with an emolument of $500. Established through the Centennial Endowment Fund. Appointment made by the Rector and Visitors upon the nomination of the Dean of the Department of Medicine. The Doctor Edward May Magruder Medical Scholarship, founded in 1927 by the American Clan Gregor Society, with an emolument of $60, is awarded upon the recommendation of the Society. Other Scholarships and Fellowships open to medical students in common with students in other departments of the University are: The Bayly-Tiffany Fellowships and Scholarships; the Valentine Birely Scholarship; the Thompson Brown Scholarship; the Isaac Cary Scholarship; the Philip Francis duPont Scholarships and Fellowships; the Richard Eppes Memorial Scholarship; the William C. Folkes Scholarships; the D. J. Hennessy Scholarship; the James Rufus Humphrey Scholarship; the McCormick Scholarship; the Thomas Fortune Ryan Scholarships; the James Parker Williams Scholarship; the Virginia Division of the United Daughters of the Confederacy Scholarship; the Samuel Watts Scholarship; the Bennett Wood Green Fellowships; and the John Y. Mason Fellowship. Loan funds also are available. For full information regarding scholarships, fellowships, and loan funds, see the General Catalogue of the University. The John Horsley Memorial Prize in Medicine with the emolument of $1,000. Founded in 1925 by Dr. J. Shelton Horsley, of Richmond, Va., as a memorial to his father, Mr. John Horsley, of Nelson County, Virginia. The prize will be awarded every two years by a committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Virginia for the best thesis upon some subject in general surgery. The term "general surgery" is used in a broad way and includes the specialties commonly associated with general surgery such as orthopedic surgery, urology and gynecology but not the specialties of the surgery of the eye, ear, nose and throat. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE The prize is open to all graduates of the Medical Department of the University of Virginia of not more than fifteen years standing. For further information, address the Dean of the Department of Medicine, University, Va. The Alpha Omega Alpha Society.âOn November 15, 1919, a charter was issued for the establishment in this University of a chapter of the honor medical society, Alpha Omega Alpha, to which there are chosen annually one-fifth of each graduating class, on the basis of scholarship, character, and professional promise. Since publication of the last catalogue the following have been elected to membership: from the class of 1931, William Morgan Chew, Alexander Gordon Gilliam, Meyer Goldstein, Angus Hinson, and Joseph William Houck; and from the class of 1932, Thomas Sterling Claiborne, Walter Ansell Derrick, John Hartwell Harrison, Jean Barksdale Jones and Elizabeth Lewis Saunders. The Iota Sigma Society.âIn the spring of 1927 there was organized a local honor medical society, Iota Sigma, whose membership is open to medical students who have completed the first term of the third year with a total of not less than 81 honor points. Prospective candidates must further qualify with regard to congeniality, personality, interest in research, practicability and future professional promise. The primary aims of this society are to raise the standard of scholarship, to stimulate sympathetic interest in research, and in every possible way to aid the Medical School in the maintenance of its high ideal of medical training and service. Since publication of the last catalogue the following have been elected to membership: Austin Brockenbrough Chinn, Thomas Sterling Claiborne, Walter Ansell Derrick, Charles Louis Gilbert, Randolph Bryan Grinnan, Jr., John Hartwell Harrison, William Dabney Jarman, Edgar Wilson Kirby, Jr., Delmar Franklin Weaver, Jr., and Munford Radford Yates. COURSES OF INSTRUCTION In the following description of courses, the number of hours represents the amount of time each student devotes to the course. In addition to the hours scheduled in the third and fourth years of the course, each student devotes a considerable amount of time to practical work which does not appear in the schedule, but the satisfactory performance of which is essential to graduation. Thus the taking of histories, the visits to his cases in the hospital, assisting at operations, attendance upon cases of labor, the employment of microscopical and chemical methods of diagnosis in the hospital, require much time which it has not seemed possible to record in a rigid schedule. The session, exclusive of the time devoted to examination, is divided into a first term of twelve weeks, a second term of ten weeks, and a third term of ten weeks. First Year Anatomy 1: 19 hours weekly during the first term and 12 hours weekly during the second term. This course begins with a systematic study of the bones, on the completion of which a part is assigned to each student for DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE dissection and study. On the completion of this course each student has dissected a lateral half of the body. The student obtains his knowledge at first hand and by his own personal efforts. Dr. Bean and Dr. Speidel. Anatomy 2: 6 hours weekly during the second term. This course consists of a laboratory study of the anatomy of the central nervous system carried out in considerable detail. The gross anatomy of the spinal cord and brain is first considered, on the completion of which sections of the more important regions are studied with the aid of the microscope. Fresh brains and series of sections of the cord and brain are thoroughly used. A reconstruction of the central nervous system showing the more important pathways is prepared by each student. Dr. Bean and Dr. Speidel. Histology: 4 lectures or recitations and 10 hours of laboratory work weekly during the first term. This course aims to acquaint the student with the microscopic structure of tissues and organs. Cytogenesis and histogenesis are briefly considered in the case of many tissues studied. The relation of histology to physiology and pathology is constantly kept in view. The student is also given opportunity to acquaint himself with the principles and practice of histological technique. A record of 70 per cent. in this course is required for admission to Physiology, and of 80 per cent. for admission to Pathology. Dr. Jordan and Dr. Kindred. Embryology: 7 hours weekly during the second term. The laboratory work (5 hours weekly) with sections and dissections of mammalian embryos, is supplemented by lectures, recitations, and the study of models. The course aims to give the student a knowledge of developmental processes, in the light of which he may the better understand the more abstruse normal conditions of adult anatomy, as well as many anomalies and variations. Dr. Jordan and Dr. Kindred. Bacteriology: Lectures, conferences and laboratory work 12 hours weekly during the third term. The object of this course is to acquaint the student with the microÃ¶rganisms which are of importance to man and his environment, the methods used in their study and identification. The fundamentals of infection and immunity are taught. The student learns the common procedures used in the diagnosis and treatment of infectious disease. So far as practicable the material studied is obtained from the environment, from the body surfaces and excretions of normal individuals, and from the body surfaces, excretions, secretions and exudates of the persons with various common pathological conditions. The student is thus introduced to the etiology of infectious disease and some of the factors involved in resistance. Through a consideration of selected bacteriologic and immunologic studies the basis is laid for the later study of epidemiology and preventive medicine. Dr. Maxcy and Dr. Kang. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE Biochemistry: Lectures and laboratory, 9 hours weekly during the second and third terms. Course comprises the chemistry of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates; digestion, intestinal putrefaction, feces; blood, milk, and bile; particular attention is devoted to the chemical physiology of digestion, secretion, excretion, internal secretion, intermediary metabolism, and nutrition. Laboratory work includes the study of carbohydrates, fats, proteins, purine compounds, etc.; gastric contents, blood, milk, and urine; the digestive enzymes and the digestion of foods; and extensive qualitative and quantitative work on urine. A grade of 70 per cent. on this course is required for admission to Physiology. Dr. Chanutin and Mr. McEwen. Second Year Physiology: Lectures, conferences, and demonstrations, 5 hours weekly during the first term, and 4 hours during the second term; laboratory work, 7 hours weekly during the first term, 3 hours weekly during the second term.

Elective 60 Total 3,581 FACILITIES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESEARCH The Department of Medicine not only fosters in its methods of instruction the inductive study by the student himself of the phenomena presented by the human body in health and disease, but also encourages the spirit of investigation of unsolved problems of medical science and practice on the part of the instructors and students. Students are encouraged to engage in research as they are prepared for it, usually assisting an instructor in some special study or else conducting the research under his guidance and advice. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE For this purpose the scientific and clinical laboratories offer the necessary facilities, and heads of departments will always be glad to suggest and outline problems for investigation by any medical student or by others possessing the necessary training therefor. Library.âThe Medical Library is housed in the New Medical Building, and is in charge of a special Librarian.

Pharmacist Jack Spencer, Ph.G., M.D. Assistant Pharmacist The hospital is the property of the University and is under the exclusive control of its Medical Faculty. It was designed and is administered as a teaching hospital, being so arranged that free use can be made of its clinical material without in any way disturbing or violating the privacy of other patients. The location of the University Hospital is a most favorable one, being situated at the intersection of two great railway trunk lines near the geographical center of the State. A large population outside of the city of Charlottesville is available as a source of clinical material, both in the wards and the Out-Patient Department. The hospital is thus enabled to serve a large area of the State, and the transportation facilities are such that this service includes a progressively increasing number of emergency cases and cases of acute illness. The buildings are arranged upon the pavilion system, consisting of a central structure, four stories in height, to which have been added up to the present time five additional units, including a service building. The central building is largely devoted to administrative purposes and general service departments. The four pavilions are connected with the main building by corridors on each floor. In these are located the wards and suites of rooms for private patients. As at present constituted, the hospital has a capacity of about 300 beds; of these, approximately 225 are available and used for clinical teaching. During the past year there were 7,280 admissions to the hospital. Attention is particularly called to the fact that the hospital, with its associated Out-Patient Department, constitutes a most valuable part of the teaching facilities of the Department of Medicine. The size of the clinic permits the presentation of a wide variety of cases, and the organization of the hospital as an integral part of the Medical Department affords exceptional facilities for thorough study of patients. DEPARTMENT OF MEDICINE THE OUT-PATIENT DEPARTMENT Commodious and well-equipped quarters for the treatment of ambulant cases are provided in the north pavilion of the hospital, and medical school building, and the service is conducted under the direct personal supervision of members of the teaching staff of the Medical Department. The character of the equipment of this department and its location in the hospital make possible the use of thorough methods in the diagnosis and treatment of cases, and the systematic examination of each patient is thus emphasized at the very outset of the student's clinical experience. More than 24,000 visits were made by patients to this department during the past year. THE BLUE RIDGE SANATORIUM The Blue Ridge Sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis, which is owned and controlled by the Virginia State Board of Health, is situated near the Medical School. Under a plan of coÃ¶peration agreed upon by the State Board of Health and the University, the Medical Director and other members of the staff of the Sanatorium give instruction in the diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis to students in the Medical School. The Sanatorium has accommodations for 270 patients. Work at the Sanatorium is part of the required course. This affiliation of the Sanatorium and the Medical School offers an opportunity almost ideal for the medical student to become thoroughly familiar with the diagnosis and treatment of this most important disease. UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA HOSPITAL TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES A training school for nurses is conducted in connection with the hospital. Full information regarding requirements for admission, and the course of instruction may be obtained by addressing the Superintendent of Nurses.</field>

SUMMARY OF ATTENDANCEâ1931 From Virginia 1,629 From other states and countries 745 Total 2,374 Less duplicates 543 Net enrollment 1,831 ANNOUNCEMENTS The Summer Quarter of the University is an integral part of the University Year, the courses in the College of Arts and Sciences being the same in character, method and in credit value as in the other quarters. In the Department of Education many professional courses for elementary and high school teachers which are not offered in the regular session are given to SUMMER QUARTER meet certificate requirements. The Summer Quarter is divided into two terms for the accommodation of those who can give only five or six weeks to the work but who desire University credit. The First Term will begin June 20 and will close July 30, with lectures 5 times a week. The Second Term will begin August 1 and close September 3, with 6 lectures a week. Students may enter for either term or both. A separate registration card must be filled out for each term. The Summer Quarter is conducted for white men and women students as follows: Elementary teachers seeking certificate or degree credit, high school teachers desiring certificate or degree credit, students just entering college desiring advanced standing, undergraduate students, pre-medical students and pre-law students desiring to meet entrance requirements, medical students, engineering students, graduate students working for the master's degree or wishing to engage in research, school officials, supervisors and superintendents, and serious minded men and women who wish a wider knowledge of some special subject or seek broader general culture. FEES Fees for Non-Virginia Students.âA registration fee of $5.00 for each term and a tuition fee of $20.00 for each term will be charged each student who registers from outside of Virginia. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue (except a few special courses which are so designated). No student, however, will be permitted to take more than 3 courses without paying a fee of $5.00 for each extra course. Fees for Virginia Teachers and Students.âTuition is entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses, leading to certification. No student, however, will be permitted to take more than 3 courses without the payment of $5.00 for each additional course. To meet local expenses, a registration fee of $5.00 for a six weeks' term and a medical fee of 75 cents is charged all students except Virginia teachers, who pay no tuition, and are charged $10.00 registration fee. An extra fee of $5.00 will be charged for each graduate course. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands, for which fees will be charged all who take them. The fee for each is designated in the catalogue. Small fees in laboratory courses will also be charged all students who register in them. Students from Virginia who are not teachers will be charged the registration fee of $5.00 and $15.00 tuition. EXPENSES Board and Rooms.âBoard and rooms may be had at prices ranging from $7.50 a week, where several stay in the same room, upward, according to accommodation and proximity to the University, the average being $7.50 to $10.00 a week. Most of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. The University Commons conducts a first-class dining-room at which meals may be obtained at $6.50 per single week, or $36.00 for six weeks. SUMMER QUARTER Full details concerning Board and Rooms may be obtained from the Catalogue of the Summer Quarter which is published annually.

In addition to those so listed there are offered also: 13 courses in Commercial Education, 16 courses in Education, 3 courses in English, 5 courses in Industrial and Fine Arts, 11 courses in Library Science, 10 courses in Music, 16 courses in Physical Education, and 5 courses in Athletic Coaching. Full descriptions of all these courses may be found in the Catalogue of the Summer Quarter. CREDITS AND DEGREES Degrees are conferred upon men and women upon exactly the same terms for work done in the Summer Quarter when the degree requirements are fully met. 60 session-hours of undergraduate courses, exclusive of Physical Education, taken in conformity with the requirements published on page 262, are required for the Bachelor's degree. Those who contemplate completing their degree requirements in the Summer Quarter should keep clearly in mind, in estimating the time that will be required, that the normal amount of credit which may be taken in one Summer Quarter is 6 session-hours. Any course for which credit on a baccalaureate degree is allowed in this University must be a complete course, that is, not a fraction of a course. For example, one or two terms only of a three-term course cannot be counted toward a degree. Similarly, when work is done elsewhere, one semester alone of a two-semester course cannot be counted toward a degree. However, combinations of fractions of courses may be allowed to count as complete courses with the approval of the Schools and Departments concerned. SUMMER QUARTER Candidates for a degree who desire credit for work done at other colleges must satisfy the entrance requirements for regular students and must, in addition, file with the Dean of the Summer Quarter a certificate covering the courses for which college credit is desired. The certificate must be acceptable both to the Dean of the Summer Quarter and to the Dean of the Department in which the degree will be obtained. The certificate must bear the official signature of the head of the candidate's college and must specify the character and content of the courses passed by the candidate and must give his grade. In every case the candidate must spend at least three full Summer Quarters at the University in order to meet the residence requirements. The Master's degree may be obtained by properly qualified persons in three Summer Quarters. In no case is this degree to be conferred upon any person who has not attended and done graduate work three full Summer Quarters or the equivalent time in the regular session of the University. All persons who are looking forward ultimately to taking a degree through summer work are urgently requested to file with the Dean of the Summer Quatrer an official statement of their entrance credits and work for which college credit is desired. In order to provide for the increasing number of students who complete the requirements for their degrees during the Summer Quarter, a convocation exercise will be held Friday evening, September 2, at 8 o'clock, when the degrees will be conferred. Catalogue and further information may be obtained by addressing Secretary Summer Quarter, Box 1337, University, Virginia. PRE-MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS Courses covering all the required subjects for entrance to the first year of the Medical School, as described on page 363 of this catalogue, are offered in the Summer Quarter so that it is possible for the student to meet the pre-medical requirements in two summer quarters and one regular session of the University. PRE-LEGAL REQUIREMENTS Courses are offered in the Summer Quarter covering all the required college work for admission to the Department of Law, see page 351 of this catalogue.

History and Purpose The first reference to University Extension at the University of Virginia appears in an early issue of College Topics, at present a student publication but originally a publication of the General Athletic Association. Volume XI, number 26, of College Topics, issued April 18, 1891, carried an account of a meeting of University of Virginia alumni at Columbia University Hall in Washington, D. C., on April 13 preceding "at which the system of education known as university extension was discussed by leading professors and learned men." A visiting speaker on this occasion "thought it eminently fitting and proper that the meeting in the interest of university extension should be called under the auspices of the Alumni Association of the University of Virginia, that institution which was founded by Thomas Jefferson who taught the true democracy of education." Notwithstanding this early reference to and interest in extension, the work was not formally introduced in the University until September 1912 when a system of extension lectures was inaugurated. There followed almost immediately the appearance of extension publications dealing with subjects which related directly to current problems in the life of the State. These publications were early organized into a regular series, The University of Virginia Record Extension Series, the first number of which appeared in September 1915. In the same year the University "desirous of extending its services beyond its academic walls to as many people of the State as possible who cannot have advantage of the resident courses in the institution" established "an Extension Bureau" as an administrative unit. By 1920-1921 the activities of this bureau had been increased to include, according to the University catalogue for that year, (1) Extension Teaching (Extension credit courses), (2) Extension Lectures, (3) Debate and Public Discussion, (4) Citizenship Education, (5) Package Libraries, (6) Publications, (7) Visual Education, (8) Home Reading Courses (in coÃ¶peration with the United States Bureau of Education), and (9) Short Courses. In 1922-1923 the title symbolizing the service was changed from Bureau of Extension to Division of Extension to conform to general practice in nomenclature among American universities. There were few precedents to follow when Extension work was first organized at the University of Virginia. Unquestionably the inspiration for the Extension movement in America came from English universities where a system DIVISION OF EXTENSION of extension lectures had been instituted as early as 1865. But the temperament of the English people and the conditions in the mother country are very different from those in America. The University of Virginia, like other State universities in America, had to deal with conditions peculiar to itself and to the State which created it for its service. Accordingly, first the Extension Bureau and later the Division of Extension had to experiment and explore. The results have been constant changes in methods of off-campus instruction due to efforts to profit by experience and to conform more closely with the University's developing ideas of its responsibilities in the fields of adult education and university extension. Much of the Extension Division's attention today is directed to the purpose of interpreting adult education and of keeping the ideal of continuing education before the people of the State, and of encouraging local communities and appropriate organizations to establish adult education institutions, especially for those unprepared to undertake education on a college or university level. Probably the most clearly recognized function of the Division is that of bringing education on the university level to college graduates and other mature adults throughout the State who are qualified to pursue such courses with pleasure and profit. Especial effort is also made by the Division to coÃ¶perate both with individuals and professional groups in this State. Many features of its program prophetic of the most far-reaching results are coÃ¶perative undertakings. Through lectures, publications, press reports, conferences and direct correspondence the Division discusses and defines the adult education movement and encourages a general consideration of the problems involved. The more specific contributions of the Division are organized under three principal Bureaus as follows: Extension Teaching, School Relations and Educational Aids. I. Extension Teaching Formal Instruction.âFormal instruction includes Extension courses offered for credit towards a University degree. Only the equivalent of courses offered in residence are given for credit in Extension. Prerequisites and general requirements are the same for Extension credit courses as for courses in residence. In every way possible, the work is made the equal of that offered at the University. Students and Fees.âFifteen or more qualified students are usually required for a credit class, although under certain circumstances a class may be organized for a smaller number, as, for example, when a very advanced course is desired. The usual fee is $12.00 per course. Subjects Offered in Extension Credit Courses.âCultural courses are emphasized by the Division but at the same time student participation in the choice of subject is encouraged. Courses requiring laboratory work, with a few exceptions, are not offered for credit in Extension. CoÃ¶peration With Other Virginia Colleges.âThe University with its resident faculty cannot alone meet all of the requests for University Extension credit courses. Rather than attempt to employ a special Extension faculty of its own, it has asked the coÃ¶peration of other higher educational DIVISION OF EXTENSION institutions in Virginia to assist in taking this form of instruction to the people of the state. The University is responsible for administrative procedure and general supervision while the several colleges and universities assist in providing instruction. A more satisfactory geographical distribution of Extension instructors results. The universities and colleges now coÃ¶perating with the Extension Division, in the order in which coÃ¶perative agreements were made, are as follows: Roanoke College, Washington and Lee University, Farmville State Teachers College, Harrisonburg State Teachers College, Fredericksburg State Teachers College, Randolph-Macon College, Sweet Briar College, Randolph-Macon Woman's College, Hampden-Sydney College, Lynchburg College, Emory and Henry College, Radford State Teachers College, William and Mary College, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute. Extension Teaching Centers.âThe Extension Division maintains, in addition to offices at the University, local offices in centers in the state from which the work in the cities or sections represented can best be carried forward. These centers with addresses are as follows: Richmond Center, Franklin and Shafer Streets, Richmond. Roanoke Center, Boxley Building, Roanoke. Lynchburg Center, E. C. Glass High School, Lynchburg. Petersburg Center, Chamber of Commerce Building, Petersburg. An Extension Class Catalogue is published annually, the latest issue of which will be sent free upon request. Informal Instruction.âInformal instruction is carried forward principally by two methods: Conference or lecture courses and home study (correspondence) courses. Neither method leads to credit towards University degrees. Conference or Lecture Courses bring together outstanding teachers and mature men and women who are interested in discussing and studying together, usually informally, some subject or problem. The Division's chief interest is, as with credit courses, in cultural subjects although opportunity for student choice of subject is furnished. These courses are valuable in reaching on a high level many adults who are not interested in a form of instruction developed especially for college youth and designed to give the student academic credit. Conferences or lectures in such courses are usually from six to fifteen in number and at weekly intervals. Organizational requirements as to numbers, number of lectures, fees, etc., are adjusted in accordance with the peculiar demands or conditions under which each course is conducted. Home Study, or correspondence instruction, represents the Division's latest venture in adult educational methods. The method is introduced in an effort to discover some satisfactory plan for offering educational guidance of a high order to many isolated men and womenâon the farm, in the small town or in cities where needs are not otherwise met. Work by the method is frankly experimental. It was begun in 1929. If after several years the DIVISION OF EXTENSION method proves to be ineffective or inadequate, an effort will be made to find a satisfactory substitute. At best home study is intelligently directed study. Student initiative is at a premium and amply provided for. Emphasis again is on purely cultural courses although courses in other subjects are included, but work in the physical sciences and modern languages is not offered by home study. The tuition fee per course is $15.00. Special catalogues are issued to give complete information in regard to home study courses. II. School Relations The work of this Bureau is concerned primarily in assisting the high school officials of the state in the conduct for educational purposes of interscholastic literary and athletic contests. Certain contests culminate annually in a final state meet at the University held usually in May. Theoretically at least those exhibiting the highest literary and athletic talents come together to match wits and skills. The school relations work also includes a coÃ¶perative program with the Virginia Classical Association for conducting state contests in Latin, and with the F. F. A.'s, an organization of boys and girls in the state interested in agriculture, in conducting a state-wide oratorical contest; and the loan of educational slides and motion pictures and art prints to schools and interested organizations or individuals throughout the state. Complete announcements of the work of the Bureau of School Relations will be sent upon request. III. Educational Aids The educational aid services include the following: Extension Library.âThe Division lends by mail under prescribed regulations, and with certain limitations, books from the University, Extension and departmental libraries for nominal costs of postage and packing. Emphasis is on the loan of the best current books, although provision is made for a wide range of interest. Alphabetical lists of books available for loan are sent free upon request. Assistance is also furnished in assembling information and reference material on subjects of current interest for use by individuals or organizations requesting such data. The University Library renders valuable assistance to the Division in its effort to increase the usefulness of the Extension Library. Radio and Newspaper Book Reviews.âClosely associated with the library extension work is that of the weekly reviews of current books, selected on the basis of merit, by members of the University and associated faculties over the WRVA broadcasting station in Richmond, Virginia. (The facilities of WRVA are offered without charge by the Larus Brothers Tobacco Company, owners and operators of the station.) The Division conducts the reviews in coÃ¶peration with the Virginia Quarterly Review. The reviews DIVISION OF EXTENSION are fifteen minutes in length and are broadcast every Tuesday evening usually between seven and eight. Only five omissions have occurred since the weekly talks were begun on November 13, 1928; both in duration and continuity the reviews are unique in radio broadcasting. The purpose of the reviews is to give a critical opinion of a selected number of the best current books. Special reviews in two forms, a long article dealing with one book and a brief discussion of several books, are furnished to the newspapers of the state which request them for publication in their book or feature sections. A single review in the longer form has been known to have been printed in seventeen papers; the usual number is ten or twelve. All books reviewed are loaned upon request by the Extension Library. Publications.âFor the purpose of carrying the results of study, research, and investigation of the University faculty to as many people as possible, the Extension Division publishes twelve bulletins on various subjects each year. Most of the bulletins are issued free of charge, but for some a nominal price is set which covers only the cost of printing. The Extension Division also issues at regular intervals a leaflet, "Extension Topics," which is chiefly a letter to Extension students serving as a bond between them and the University; and "University of Virginia Extension," which is circulated widely as a medium of information about the classes, publications and activities of the Division. Special care is given to the task of placing the printed materials in the hands of those who most appreciate and profit by them. A leaflet published annually describes available Extension publications. Bureau of School and Community Drama.âThe Bureau of School and Community Drama has as its immediate purpose assistance in the selection of suitable plays for schools and community organizations. It also offers help in the actual production or staging of plays. Printed announcements giving more fully the services that can be rendered by this Bureau are sent upon request. Aid to Teachers of Illiterates.âAt the suggestion of the State Department of Public Instruction, package libraries containing a few books for illiterates and materials outlining a method of teaching adult illiterates to read and write have been assembled. Upon request, these libraries are loaned teachers of illiterates, and others interested in methods of adult elementary education. While the Division does not attempt to teach illiterates or near-illiterates nor to carry forward elementary adult education, it will continue to assist upon request teachers in these fields.</field>

Research Assistant in Labor Problems DELBERT MARTIN MANN, M.A. Research Associate in Sociology EDWARD ALLISON TERRY, M.S. Research Associate in Rural Social Economics Establishment.âThe announcement was made by President Alderman to the Rector and the Board of Visitors of the University of Virginia during the commencement exercises in June, 1926, that the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Memorial had made a grant of $137,500 to the University for research in the field of the social sciences; economics, government, sociology, history, psychology, jurisprudence and related subjects. The grant extends over a five-year period, $27,500 becoming available each of the years from July 1, 1926, through June 30, 1931. At the close of the first five-year period the grant was renewed by the Rockefeller Foundation for another five years, contingent upon an increasing support pledged by the University from its budget. The work under the provisions of the grant has been organized as an Institute for Research in the Social Sciences. The President of the University, INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH the Assistant to the President, the members of the University faculty of professorial rank in the schools of History, Economics, Government, Jurisprudence, Philosophy, Psychology, Rural Social Economics, and Sociology, and the employed personnel constitute the membership of the Institute. As outlined in the resolutions which were adopted by the Institute, "the duty of this Institute shall be to promote research effort, both individual and group, in the Social Sciences at the University of Virginiaâat the outset primarily in the field of Virginia problems. It shall further be the function of the Institute to consider any matter that concerns the development of the Social Sciences in the University of Virginia, making recommendations thereon to the President of the University." Social Science Building.âThe Institute is housed in one of the original Jefferson buildings of the University formerly known as the Old Medical Building. The interior of the structure has been thoroughly repaired and put in excellent condition for the activities of the Institute. Provision is made for office space and equipment for the research workers, and also a general office has been set up where supplies and secretarial assistance are provided. Scope of Research Effort.âThe grant to the University of Virginia is being utilized at the outset primarily for research into a number of vital economic and social problems in the life of the State. It has chosen this field for two reasons. First, because Virginia is in a changing period in its history, and needs full light on its problems to direct as wisely as possible the current of transition. And secondly, the University of Virginia realizes that it is a State University and desires to relate itself more and more intimately with the people and the life of the State in general, feeling that such a relationship will be mutually beneficial. However, the work of the Institute in its full development will not be limited to the field of Virginia problems but large provision will be made for scholarly research in the broader phases of social science research without respect to geographical boundaries. The research in the Institute is carried on as the professor's own research project assisted by well-trained research workers. The plan is to limit the number of problems to be studied, and to do these thoroughly, and in a way that will make the investigations of an immediate or ultimate usefulness in the life of the State, as well as constituting contributions to the broader field of social science research. A definite portion of the grant is being allotted for the publication of the studies when completed.

STUDIES IN PROGRESS 1. Currency, Credit and Crises in Virginia Since 1860 By E. A. Kincaid, Professor of Finance. A study of the financial reconstruction in the state designed to reveal the evolution of the state banking system, the effect of the various monetary policies of the federal government, including the resumption of specie payments, the issuance of silver certificates, and the return to the gold standard; an analysis of the several industrial crises; and the effect of all of these on the economic recovery of the state from the devastation of the Civil War. 2. Ability in Social and Racial Classes By Roland C. Davis, Research Associate in Psychology. Social groups, such as Negroes, rural and urban whites, population of the mountain regions, immigrant groups, etc., are seen to differ in general behavior and way of life. Current intelligence tests have usually shown differences in average scores obtained by such groups. The present study is an attempt to analyze such differences in certain fundamental traits, presumably unaffected by accidents of environment. The speed with which impulses are conducted along nerves, the rapidity of voluntary movement, the rise and subsidence of activity in the sympathetic nervous system, the modifiability of nervous pathways, and possibly other traits, are being, or will be studied. While these are far from INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH all the traits needing study, it is hoped the investigation will contribute to a settlement of differences between social groups. 3. The Jails of Virginia By Floyd N. House, Professor of Sociology, Frank W. Hoffer, Associate Professor of Sociology, and Delbert M. Mann, Research Associate in Sociology. The purpose of this study is to present a comprehensive and accurate picture of the equipment, population and administration of the county and city jails of Virginia, and of the procedure of the lower courts which have much to do with the selection of the jail population. It is a part of a larger departmental research program having as its purpose the securing of a factual foundation for a welfare program and legislation. Under present conditions the study is of necessity primarily descriptive, laying a foundation for other more detailed studies. 4. The Cotton Cooperative in the South By Wilson Gee, Professor of Rural Economics and Rural Sociology and Edward A. Terry, Research Associate in Rural Social Economics. No part of the United States has been more severely affected by the postwar agricultural depression than have the Southern States. Some experiments are being made in the adjustment of national policies to provide farm relief; but the success of them is considered quite dubious. In any plan of agricultural rehabilitation, the farmer's own efforts must play a large part. The volume of farm production must be greatly increased in efficiency. The most practical approach to these matters is through cooperative associations. The best form of cooperative marketing is that organized upon the commodity basis. Hence the problem of what has been achieved along these lines and the hope for future progress are matters of first importance in the economy of the South. 5. State Subsidies in Virginia By Tipton R. Snavely, Professor of Economics, D. Clark Hyde, Associate Professor of Economics and Alvin B. Biscoe, Research Associate in Economics. The purpose of this project is to study the apportionment of State funds to the local subdivisions of Virginia. It involves an investigation of the policies which are not followed and which might be followed in making grants-in-aid from the State government to the counties and cities. The major purposes for which such grants are made are public education, public highways and public health. The study will naturally include also an inquiry into the taxable capacity and the present tax burdens of the local subdivisions. 6. Labor and Labor Conditions in Virginia By George T. Starnes, Associate Professor of Commerce and Business Administration and John E. Hamm, Research Assistant in Commerce. The purpose of such a study is to make a careful investigation of labor conditions in the more important industrial centers of the state. Such problems as labor supply, wages, living conditions, living costs, labor legislation, and the development of labor unions in the state would be dealt with. INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH 7. Land Jobbing and the Revolution By Thomas P. Abernethy, Associate Professor of History. The value and extent of the public lands rendered this one of the most important questions dealt with by the legislatures of the Revolutionary and Early Republican periods. The statutes passed in this connection throw unimpeachable light upon the struggle between democracy and privilege which went on in the new states. Speculations, sponsored by individuals or chartered land companies, often give an insight into important political situations and the motives of public officials. It is with the hope of discovering some of the secret springs of Virginian politics during this important period that the study of the land question is undertaken. 8. Life of Mazzini By Stringfellow Barr, Professor of History. A biographical study of the nineteenth century nationalist, of whom no satisfactory biography has been written in any language to date. 9. Experimental Study of Human Instincts By Wayne Dennis, Assistant Professor of Psychology. In spite of an enormous literature concerning human instincts, practically the only experimental investigations of instinctive human responses are those of Watson. These studies were limited to infants so young that many instinctive responses may have been as yet undeveloped. The present project will utilize older subjects. The difficulty of making certain that the response to be observed, such as responses to strangers, to animals, to the sea, etc., have not been influenced by training will be met by a careful selection of subjects from among hospitalized children, institutionalized children, and children from isolated communities. When techniques are developed and a general knowledge of instinctive responses acquired, the problem can be widened to include a comparison of racial and social groups. 10. Scientific Interests in the Old South By T. Cary Johnson, Jr., Associate Professor of History. In working up this project an attempt will be made to answer, among others, such questions as the following: What was the effect of the agricultural philosophies of Jefferson's day, with their all-embracing interests, in stimulating a genuine enthusiasm for science? Did the achievements in some special field by Southerners, as for instance in geology by LeConte, or in hydrography by Maury, or in ornithology by Audubon, or in anesthetics by Long, develop from this earlier scientific curiosity by any discernible process of differentiation? How widespread was this curiosity in regard to natural phenomena? What effect did it have on schools and colleges? And what effect on ante-bellum religious beliefs? What were its contributions to material well-being in the form of useful inventions? What part did Southerners play in preparing for the Industrial Era and in bringing about the Machine Age? These are some of the questions to be answered in a volume of moderate size. INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH 11. The Executive Power in Virginia By G. W. Spicer, Associate Professor of Political Science. In this study the development of the office of governor in Virginia will be traced through its various stages, and a critical estimate given of the desirability of the changes which it has undergone. Finally, special emphasis will be given to the present status of this office in its relation to the legislative function, the judicial function, the administrative function, political leadership, etc. In short, the object of this study will be to tell, in a critical manner, the story of the government of Virginia as it revolves about the office of the governor. 12. Guide to Manuscript Sources and Collections in Virginia By Lester J. Cappon, Archivist and Research Associate in History. The need of a guide to manuscripts in Virginia, to bring to light for the research student materials hitherto unknown in libraries, government offices, and in private hands, led to the inception of this project to make a state-wide inventory of all original records available or which can be made accessible. This survey includes detailed lists of records in the state, county, and city archives, in college and university libraries, and in historical societies; also the original record books and papers of business houses, churches and lodges, schools, banks, public utilities, and other organizations. The survey also includes a list of Virginia newspaper files throughout the state. A card index by county is kept so that the information can be re-organized later for publication. In addition to the survey, the archivist is collecting manuscripts for the Library of the University where they are cataloged and filed for research work.</field>

Books may be borrowed for use outside of the general library by (1) members of the University; (2) former officers and professors who are residing at the University; and (3) card holders. Cards are issued to residents of Charlottesville and vicinity and to visitors to the University who are guaranteed in writing by a member of the faculty who is of professorial rank and who is not a member of the library staff. Loans outside of Charlottesville or vicinity may also be made by interlibrary loan through a local library or by arrangement with the Extension Division of the University. Reference books, rare books (including genealogical works), and current numbers of magazines are not loaned out of the general library. Certain rare editions which are desired for reading in connection with university courses may be loaned on receipt of written request from the Professor in charge of the course. Books reserved for collateral reading may be borrowed for over night use one-half hour before the closing of the library. Reserved books are not to be removed from the reading room at other times unless written permission has been granted by the professor for whom the books have been reserved. During vacations between terms students may borrow books up to the number of five by leaving a money deposit with the circulation librarians. Books borrowed by members of the faculty of professorial rank or by instructors who are not taking graduate courses are subject to return on request by the librarians; all such loans should be returned before the first of June of each year, and records previous to that date should be cleared before further borrowing of books. Books borrowed by registered graduate students, hospital internes, and qualified non-student employees of the University are loaned for the current term, on the understanding that they may be recalled when needed by other readers. The records of each term should be cleared before borrowing is resumed on the following term. All other loans are for periods of two weeks or less, the date of return being indicated on the slip within the back cover of the book. The borrower should examine this date in each case, since at the end of each term the period UNIVERSITY LIBRARIES of loan is shortened and during the summer quarter the regular period is one week. All except professorial loans are subject to fines of ten cents a day for late return, and also to the replacement cost of the book for loss or defacement. On reserved books there is a fine of ten cents an hour but not to exceed twenty-five cents for the first day, and fines of twenty-five cents a day for each succeeding day or part of day. The maximum fines are three dollars for an ordinary loan and five dollars for the loan of a reserved book. Further accumulation of fines ceases as soon as the loss of a book is reported. If any fines remain unpaid for fifteen days after the date on which they are due, the Librarian shall, by resolution of the Rector and Visitors, notify the Dean of the Department in which the student is entered, and such student shall by him be required to cease his privileges as a student until the library account has been satisfactorily settled.

      <field name="fulltext">STUDENT ACTIVITIES STUDENT ACTIVITIES JEFFERSON LITERARY SOCIETY Connected with the University is the Jefferson Society founded in 1825 to provide for common improvement in debate, to promote general culture among its members and the student body, and to drill its members in all those exercises which strengthen for the free duties of citizenship. All students in regular attendance upon one or more of the schools of the University of Virginia who are not members of any similar organization in this institution shall be eligible to regular membership. Such candidates shall make written applications on forms provided by the Membership Committee. These forms may be obtained at any of the literary meetings of the Society all of which are open to the public. They are announced in College Topics. WOMAN'S SELF-GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION The Association includes all women students of the University of Virginia, and exists to bring about a greater unity and mutual helpfulness among the women of the University, and to promote and maintain the highest standards of University life. PUBLICATIONS College Topics is a tri-weekly newspaper published by the students and devoted to the interests of the University at large. Corks and Curls is the University annual, its aim being to present some record of the scholastic, religious, athletic and social activities of the college year. Its publication is in the hands of a chartered corporation formed by the fraternities and literary societies of the University. The Virginia Law Review is a journal devoted to the discussion of general questions of American jurisprudence published monthly from October to May, inclusive, by the students of the Law Department.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">RELIGIOUS WORK RELIGIOUS WORK YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION, INCORPORATED Joseph Shackford Johnston President John Randolph Williams Vice-President Miles Poindexter, II Secretary Elmer Irving Carruthers Treasurer William Kyle Smith General Secretary Mrs. Albert Edward Walker Hostess History.âThe Young Men's Christian Association of the University of Virginia has the distinction of being the oldest organization of its kind in existence. It was founded October 12, 1858, and has today a larger proportionate membership than that in any other state university in America. Object.âThe object of this Association, as set forth generally in the Charter, is more specifically stated as follows:â to foster and promote Christian fellowship among the students of the University of Virginia by encouraging their participation in religious activities; by provoking their serious thought on great moral and religious issues; by inculcating in them the spirit of service; and by providing for them, and increasing their appreciation of, social entertainment of a wholesome and beneficial nature. Work.âThe Association affords opportunity for voluntary study of the Bible and also of problems of national and international interest, particularly with reference to the possibility of solution by the fundamental principles of Christianity. Through denominational clubs the organization seeks to relate the students to the churches of their choice and through voluntary service of its members materially assistsâand in some cases wholly mansâthe Sunday Schools and young people's societies of the churches in the community. In addition to this definite religious service in the community members of the Association work with Boy Scout troops and cooperate with community agencies in other forms of welfare work. Both religious and welfare activities are carried into the outlying districts under the supervision of the Extension Department of the Association; and free medical clinics which were originally established in these localities by the Association have increased in usefulness and importance through active cooperation with the State and University medical staffs. Under the Deputation Committee, student leaders and groups of students visit various preparatory and high schools in the State to conduct religious meetings, and they also carry on evangelistic campaigns in various communities throughout the State. In addition to these activities outside the University the Association, through receptions, entertainments, and "Open Houses," stimulates social intercourse among the students. Equipment.âThrough the munificence of Mrs. William E. Dodge and family, of New York City, the Association possesses a very handsome building, RELIGIOUS WORK which was erected in 1905, at a cost, including furnishings, of about $80,000, and which is maintained in part by an endowment of over $16,000, subscribed by students, alumni, and friends of the University. This building, called "Madison Hall" in honor of President Madison, who was intimately connected with the early history of the University, faces the north front of the Rotunda. In recent years Madison Hall has become the center of social and student activities of the University as well as of the religious; and offices in the building have been furnished gratis to the more prominent student publications and organizations. All the privileges including the use of tennis courts, showers, reading room and library, rooms for meetings, services of the Hostess, Information Bureau, handbook, student directory, etc., are open to any student without cost. About one-half of the budget for the support of the Association work and the maintenance of Madison Hall is supplied by the income from a small endowment, the Chapel fund, and a sum allocated by the University. As it is the student organization definitely devoted toward serving the religious, social and economic interests of the students, the remainder of the budget necessary for this work must come from the student body. A campaign is held in the fall for the remainder of the budget. At this time the opportunity of contributing to the service and upkeep of Madison Hall is given to each student. THE UNIVERSITY CHAPEL The handsome Gothic chapel was erected upon the University grounds by the voluntary gifts of students, alumni, members of the faculty and other friends. Services are conducted in it every Sunday evening during the regular session.</field>
      <field name="fulltext">ATHLETICS ATHLETICS JAMES GLENN DRIVER, Director THOMAS MOORE CARRUTHERS, Assistant Intercollegiate and intramural athletics are under the direction and supervision of the Director of Athletics and his staff. The faculty exercises a general advisory control over all athletics, endeavoring to foresee and avert dangerous tendencies or excess in physical exercise. The development of the general policies of the University in athletics is intrusted to the Athletic Councilâ a body composed of three representatives of the student body, three representatives of the Alumni Association, three representatives of the General Faculty and the President of the University. The action of this body is subject to ratification by the General Faculty. The Executive Committee of the Athletic Council, composed of one of its student members, one of its alumni members, its three faculty members and the President of the University, are responsible for the administration of any laws or regulations governing intercollegiate athletics whether originating from the Athletic Council, the faculty or from any Conference of which the University may be a member. The faculty members of the Council form the committee on eligibility. The University of Virginia is a member of the Southern Conference. EXTRACTS FROM THE BY-LAWS OF THE SOUTHERN CONFERENCE Article VII General Code Section 1. Post-Season Games. The football season shall close the second Saturday following Thanksgiving and no member of this Conference shall engage in any intercollegiate football game after that date except with the consent of the Conference. Section 2. Freshman Teams. Freshman teams shall be composed of members of the freshman class only, who shall not compete as such for more than one year, and shall be eligible under the rules of this Conference, except the one-year rule. For the purpose of this rule, a Freshman is a student who enters the Institution from a High School or a Preparatory School. The Freshman football teams of this Conference shall be allowed to play only five games in any regular season. Section 3. Training Table and Training Quarters. No member of this Conference is permitted to maintain a training table for any intercollegiate team. ATHLETICS Section 4. Preliminary Training. There shall be no preliminary training, assembling of candidates or issuing of equipment prior to the first Monday in September. Athletic associations of Southern Conference institutions may bear the expense of food for men during preliminary training provided that no such expenses shall begin prior to the first Monday in September nor prior to fifteen days before the opening of the college session. No freshman students shall be allowed to assemble for practice before the opening of college. Section 5. Contests with Non-Conference Members. No Conference Institution shall compete with any non-conference institution in Conference territory, of similar athletic rank, that is, one which competes with any member of the Conference upon the basis of athletic equality, unless both compete under the rules of eligibility of the Conference. A list of such institutions shall be determined from year to year at the annual meeting. Section 6. Eligibility Certificates. Before any student can compete in any intercollegiate contest, the faculty chairman of the Athletic Committee of his Conference Institution shall certify the eligibility of football candidates to the Chairman of the Executive Committee. All lists shall be made on blanks furnished by the Secretary and such blanks shall have printed on their face the rules of eligibility of the Conference and also a certificate in the following form, which certificate shall be signed by the Registrar of the Institution, who certifies to the competitor's eligibility on a scholastic basis, and by the Faculty Chairman of the Athletic Committee, who certifies to the competitor's eligibility on the basis of the Conference Rules: "We certify that the following men are eligible according to the rules of eligibility of the Southern Conference and the scholastic requirements of (member institution)." Section 7. Rules. All rules of the Conference shall apply to all intercollegiate sports. Article VIII Rules of Eligibility The following rules apply to all sports: Rule 1. Bona Fide Students. No one shall participate in any intercollegiate contest unless he is a bona fide matriculated student with at least 15 Carnegie units regularly enrolled and doing full work as defined by the regulations of the institution in which he is enrolled; provided that no student in any Conference institution which admits conditional students with less than fifteen Carnegie units shall be eligible for varsity competition unless such student on first entrance presents fifteen Carnegie units either by certificate or examination and provided further that no work done after such entrance shall remove such ineligibility. A student in special agricultural or other special courses who does not present the full entrance credits is not eligible under this rule. ATHLETICS Rule 2. No person shall participate in intercollegiate athletics at an institution until after the expiration of twelve months from the date of his matriculation there, and until he shall have completed the scholastic requirements of that institution. Rule 3. Attendance. No student having been a member of any athletic team of his college during any year and having been in attendance less than one-half of the college year shall be permitted to participate in any intercollegiate contest thereafter until he shall have been in attendance one-half of the next college year. The term "college year" shall be construed to mean the term beginning in September of each year and continuing for two semesters or three quarters. Note: Attendance during Summer Sessions is not counted as "attendance" for the purpose of this rule. Rule 4. Migrant Students. (a) No person who has participated in any intercollegiate contest in any branch of sport as a member of any college or service team shall be permitted to participate in any intercollegiate contest in the same sport as a member of a team of any other institution in this Conference. For the purpose of this rule, an intercollegiate contest is a contest played by the varsity or the freshman teams. (b) Students who have pursued courses of study at one university or college but who have not participated in an intercollegiate contest, shall be eligible to participate in intercollegiate athletics at another institution, but only when they have satisfied the conditions as set forth in Rule 2âthe one-year-residence rule. (c) Transfers from a junior college, normal school or other institution not offering a standard four-year course may be allowed to continue their athletic careers at the institution to which they transfer provided that they conform to the one-year-residence rule. (d) A student in the preparatory department of a college who plays on the freshman or varsity team of that college, if he transfers to a Conference college, shall be regarded as a migrant student. Rule 5. Limit of Participation. Participation in intercollegiate athletics shall be limited to one freshman and three years varsity over a period of five college years counting from date of first matriculation. Every student shall be allowed three years of varsity participation in each sport, provided such participation falls within the five-year period herein defined. Rule 6. Compensation. (a) No person who receives any compensation from his institution for services rendered by way of regular instruction shall be allowed to participate in intercollegiate contests. (b) No person shall be allowed to participate in any intercollegiate contest who receives any gift, remuneration, or pay for his services on a college team. (c) No person shall be permitted to participate in any intercollegiate contest who has ever used his knowledge of athletics or his athletic or gymnastic skill for gain. ATHLETICS Note: This rule does not apply to any person who has worked in connection with a playground or a summer camp where the requirements do not call for a man with technical preparation in physical training. (d) The following persons shall be ineligible to compete on any team in this Conference: (1) Those who hold any scholarship, fellowship or cadetship involving financial benefit which is awarded wholly or in part for athletic ability. (2) Those who enjoy any loan fund or similar benefit which is awarded wholly or in part for athletic ability. (3) Those who hold any position involving financial benefit which is awarded wholly or in part for athletic ability. (e) Any college athlete receiving money for signing a contract with a professional baseball team shall be ineligible for intercollegiate athletics. Rule 7. Summer Baseball. No athlete in any Conference institution shall participate as a member of any summer baseball team without the consent of his Faculty Committee on Athletics; and such a player when given permission to play on such team shall submit at the reopening of the school term to his Faculty Committee, a certified statement that he has not received pecuniary compensation therefor. No student playing on a baseball team recognized by the National Baseball Commission shall be eligible for intercollegiate athletics. Rule 8. No student shall be eligible to participate in any intercollegiate contest if he has played on any summer baseball team which played more than three games a week while he was a member of it. This rule applies to regularly matriculated college students and not to students who played summer baseball before entering college. To this list of professional teams thus prescribed, shall be added all the teams in any state which the Conference institutions of such state declare professional and from which they debar their own players. In the event said Conference can not agree on prescribed teams, the Executive Committee shall have power to decide the issue and the action of the Committee shall be final. A student who plays baseball on team which plays three games a week shall not be allowed to play on any other team during the same week. No college player is permitted to play on an athletic team other than that of his own college during the college year. Rule 9. Assumed Name. No person shall take part in any intercollegiate contest under an assumed name. Rule 10. Delinquency in Studies. No student who is found delinquent in his studies by the faculty shall be permitted to participate in any intercollegiate contest. A student to be eligible must have passed during the preceding year three-fourths and during the preceding term three-fifths of the proportionate percentage of hours required for graduation in the course in which he is registered. Rule 11. Outside Participation. No college football player is permitted to play on a football team other than that of his own college. ATHLETICS REGULATIONS OF THE GENERAL FACULTY CONCERNING ATHLETICS 1. The Athletic Council is intrusted with the general oversight of athletics, and is authorized to forbid any features in these exercises which endanger the health or morals of the participants and to foster the true spirit of amateur sport among them. 2. No student shall play upon the University athletic teams except after physical examination by the Director of the Gymnasium (or by a responsible expert officer of the University, acting in his stead and by his request and with the approbation of the Director). 3. Only students who act as regular or substitute members of the athletic teams will be granted leaves of absence to accompany them on trips away from the University. 4. The athletic teams shall not have contests elsewhere than upon the University grounds with any teams except those from other institutions of learning. 5. To be eligible for an intercollegiate athletic contest an applicant must be a bona fide student who is pursuing a course of at least ten hours of undergraduate work or a course of study certified by the proper authority, and must not be on probation. (See page 258.) 6. Before any student can take part in any intercollegiate contest, he shall make application in a prescribed form in writing to the Executive Committee of the Athletic Council and secure the endorsed approval of his application from the committee. It shall be the duty of the Executive Committee of the Athletic Council to have the executive officers of the University endorse such application to the effect that the applicant is eligible under Rule 5. 7. It shall be the duty of the Executive Committee of the Athletic Council to inquire into and make a record of the athletic experiences of the applicant, who shall appear before the committee and answer on his honor such questions as the committee may see fit to ask. 8. It shall be the duty of the Executive Committee of the Athletic Council, before it endorses an application, to require of the applicant a written pledge, certifying on his honor that he has never accepted directly or indirectly remuneration, compensatory gift, valuable consideration or the promise thereof for or on account of his athletic services, and that he is in the proper and strict sense of the word an amateur athlete. 9. No student who is receiving from the University remuneration for teaching or administrative services shall be eligible for the University teams. 10. It shall be the duty of the President of the General Athletic Association, the Executive Committee of that Association, the Graduate Manager, the Manager and the Captain of the team concerned, the Director of the ATHLETICS Gymnasium, the Associate Director of Athletics, and the Treasurer of the Association, to furnish on request a statement to the effect that each member of an athletic team is above their suspicion as to his eligibility to represent the University as a proper amateur player, before such player shall be allowed to take part in any contest. 11. No coach or trainer of any athletic team shall be employed without the sanction of the Athletic Council. 12. The members of any athletic team may be allowed not more than eight days' leave of absence from the University for the purpose of engaging in athletic contests; but no student who is a member of more than one athletic team shall be allowed more than sixteen days' leave of absence during the entire session for such purpose, nor more than eight days' leave of absence during any one term. 13. Not more than four days' leave of absence from the University shall be given to those First-Year Athletic teams which are regularly organized by the General Athletic Association. 14. The football team is permitted to play games only on the home grounds of one of the contestants. 15. Special reports may be made to the President from time to time by any departmental faculty with respect to the class-standing and progress in study of each regular and substitute player on the athletic teams, and if the President and such faculty are convinced that his class-standing is discreditable, such student may be required to sever his connection with such team.</field>
