Andrew Jackson Terry Brown Analytical Chemistry Robert Massie Page ZoÃ¶logy Conway Zirkle ZoÃ¶logy ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. Required for Admission to the Department.âA candidate for admission to the Department of Graduate Studies must have a baccalaureate degree from a recognized institution of collegiate rank; or, in case the institution he attended does not confer such a degree, he must present a certificate of graduation in a course of study accepted by the Academic Faculty as fully equivalent to that ordinarily required for the degree in question. Required for Admission as Applicant for a Degree.âIn order to be recognized as an applicant for a Master's or Doctor's degree, any candidate who has not received a baccalaureate degree from this university must secure from the Registrar of the University a blank form, which, when properly filled out, he must file with the Dean of this department, together with a catalogue of the institution from which he graduated. If that institution has (1) a faculty of at least six professors giving their full time to college or university work; (2) entrance requirements equal to those of this university, and (3) a course of four full years in the liberal arts and sciences, the candidate will not be required to take any undergraduate courses except such as the Committee on Rules and Courses or the professors in charge of the graduate courses he elects may consider necessary for their successful prosecution. If, however, the institution in question does not meet the three conditions mentioned above, the candidate's preparation will be carefully considered by the Committee on Rules and Courses, which will prescribe such undergraduate courses as are deemed necessary to supply his deficiencies. REGULATIONS. Grade.âThe grade of a student in any course, either for a term or for the session, is determined by his class standing and his examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor in charge of the course in question may decide. Grade Required for Passing.âFor passing in any course a grade of seventy-five per cent is required. Absence from Examination will not be excused except for sickness on the day of examination, attested by a physician's certificate, or for other cause which the Faculty by special order may approve. An unexcused absence is counted as a total failure. Special Examinations.âA student whose absence from an examination REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. is excused, is entitled to a special examination on a date to be arranged between himself and the professor in charge. Change of Subjects of Study after registration can be made only with the consent of the Dean and of the professors concerned. REQUIREMENTS FOR DEGREES. Graduate in a School. Any student who successfully completes all the courses offered in any academic School is entitled to a diploma of graduation in that School. The Master's Degrees. A candidate who has received a baccalaureate degree from this university, or who has fulfilled the conditions above specified under Entrance Requirements, is entitled to a master's degree upon his successful completion of four graduate courses, chosen in accordance with the restrictions detailed below: No C course which a candidate has offered as part of the work credited for baccalaureate degree (pp. 156-157) may be counted for a master's degree. A candidate must take at least two graduate courses during the last year of his work for a master's degree, and no candidate may receive this degree until at least one year after he has received his baccalaureate degree, except by special consent of the Academic Faculty. The degree of Master of Arts is conferred upon a Bachelor of Arts who has successfully completed four graduate courses, chosen with the approval of the Academic Faculty. These four courses must be in at least three distinct subjects, and in three different academic Schools, except by special order of the Academic Faculty. Three of the subjects must be cognate, which means that they must be selected from kindred groups of subjects, such as, for example, languages and literature, or mathematics and natural science, or history, economics, and government, or philosophy, education, and biology. The degree of Master of Science is conferred upon a holder of the cultural degree of Bachelor of Science (p. 156), who has successfully completed four graduate courses chosen in accordance with the regulations prescribed for the Master of Arts above. The degree of Master of Science in a Special Subject, the name of which is inscribed on the diploma, is conferred upon a holder of the vocational degree of Bachelor of Science in a Special Subject (p. 157), who has successfully completed four graduate courses selected from among those offered in his special subject, or from among other courses which meet with the approval of the professor or professors in charge of his special subject. Doctor of Philosophy. A candidate for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy must hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts or the cultural degree of Bachelor of Science DEPARTMENT OF GRADUATE STUDIES. of this university, or, if he be a graduate of some other institution, he must have fulfilled the conditions above specified under Entrance Requirements. The requirements for the degree are as follows: (1) A reading knowledge of French and German, attested by the successful completion of the B courses in these languages, or else by examinations held at the beginning of the first year of the candidate's work for the doctorate, by committees consisting of the professor in charge of the candidate's major subject and the professors of French and German, respectively. If the candidate fails on one or both of these examinations, he will be required to enter the appropriate course in one or both of these languages. No student will be regarded as a regular candidate for the doctorate until he has fulfilled this requirement. (2) The successful completion of at least three years of graduate work in three subjects, to be known, respectively, as the candidate's major, primary minor and secondary minor. These subjects must be cognate (see p. 161), and must be chosen, with the approval of the Committee on Rules and Courses, from at least three academic Schools. The major must be pursued for at least three years, the primary minor for at least two years, and the secondary minor for at least one year. Any student taking a D course in any subject may be required by the professor, with the approval of the Academic Faculty, to attend such lectures or courses in any of the academic Schools as the professor may deem necessary. Graduate work done in other universities may be accepted in lieu of resident work, provided sufficient evidence is furnished by examination, written or oral, or both, that such work has been of a grade similar to that required here, and has been satisfactorily performed, and provided also that the candidate takes in this university at least one graduate course in his primary minor, and does at least one year's resident work in his major subject. A candidate who is a professor in a chartered college or university, of the subject selected by him as major, may be allowed by the Academic Faculty to spend only two years in resident work. In all cases the work of the last year of candidacy shall be done in residence, unless the Academic Faculty shall for special reasons direct otherwise. (3) A dissertation exhibiting independent research in some branch of the candidate's major subject. The dissertation must be submitted to the Academic Faculty not later than April 15 of the year in which the candidate applies for the degree. Moreover, the copy presented for the Faculty's approval shall be written (typewritten, if feasible) on paper of prescribed quality and size, shall be bound, and shall have certain prescribed phrases on the cover and title page. If the dissertation is accepted by the Faculty as satisfactory, the copy submitted shall immediately become the property of the University. Before the degree is conferred the dissertation must be printed at the candidate's expense, and one hundred copies deposited in the library of the University; or, if this be impracticable on account of lack of time, the candidate must deposit with the Bursar a sum of money sufficient to have a hundred copies of the dissertation printed. EXPENSES. EXPENSES. The necessary expenses of a Virginia student in the Department of Graduate Studies may be estimated at from $220 a year upward, according to the mode of living; for students from other States this minimum should be increased by a sum ranging from $90 to $130 for tuition fees. A fuller statement of expenses, including the conditions under which Virginians and other students are entitled to free tuition, will be found on pp. 98-104. Applicants for degree of Doctor of Philosophy who are granted the privilege of non-residence during a period of their candidacy, under the conditions above stated, are required to register each year during such period of non-residence, and to pay the annual university fee ($10 for Virginians, $40 for students from other States).

The Purpose of the School of Education.âIn the rapid development of educational science and the resulting attention given to the improvement of the several phases of public education, it is important that all who are interested in the growth of this great agency of democracy, generally or professionally, be given ample opportunity to study its underlying principles, organization and most practical applications. Those who aim to teach or to administer public-school affairs require instruction and training in the scientific principles and in the technique of their calling. The study of the principles, ways and means of formal education is incumbent on all citizens who earnestly seek an intelligent and conscientious balloting on public school affairs. For these reasons the courses in the School of Education aim to supply the needs of the two classes of citizens referred to. Besides those courses which, as contributing toward a liberal education, may be advantageously included in programs of study leading to the cultural academic degrees (see pp. 156-157), the School of Education offers a wide range of courses for the professional training of teachers and public school administrators. One curriculum is offered leading to the degree of B.S. in Education (see p. 158), and one curriculum leading to a teacher's certificate only. 1. Students receiving the B.S. in Education will receive the Professional Collegiate Certificate issued by the Department of Public Instruction of Virginia. 2. A student who cannot complete the requirements for the B.S. in Education, or who must delay the completion of them, may elect the following two-year course which leads to a Teacher's Certificate issued by the Department of Public Instruction of Virginia. This work may later be credited toward the B.S. in Education. The course, comprising 30 session-hours embraces the following requirements: (a) From the School of Education: Education B2, B3, B6, and B7 or B8. Total: 12 session-hours. (b) From the other Academic Schools: One modern language course from Group I, and one course each from Groups II, III, IV and V. Total: 18 session-hours. Courses for Teachers in Service.âSaturday courses in any subject offered in the school of Education will be arranged for teachers in service, if requested by at least five teachers. Degree credit will be allowed on the same basis as in regular courses, provided that not more than one and one-half session-hours of credit shall be given for the work in any course for one year. Recommendation of Teachers.âThe recommendation of teachers is in charge of the Bureau of Appointments, through which positions are secured, not only for students in the School of Education, but for other students who are known to be fitted to fill vacancies reported. In response to requests ANNOUNCEMENT OF COURSES. from the proper authorities, teachers are recommended for positions as instructors in colleges and normal schools, as superintendents, as supervisors in special subjects, as principals or department teachers in high schools, and as principals of elementary schools.

III. In Life: The philosophic life of the Romans. Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, 12-1. Cabell Hall. Professor Fitz-Hugh, Mr. Barton. For Graduates. Latin D1: Latin C1 or C2 prerequisite.âThis course extends through three years and is intended for those who desire to specialize for one, two or three years in classical philology. It contemplates especially the needs of those who choose Latin as their major for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy. If the candidate's major be Latin, a respectable familiarity with Greek is required, since the language, literature, and life of the Romans are saturated with Greek influence. If the candidate's major be Romanic, the technical Greek requirement is waived as far as practically possible, and he is guided into the history of the Roman popular vernacular, the common source of the Romanic tongues, and into an acquaintance with the authors illustrating the Vulgar Latin in literature. For the sake of first-hand access to important modern authorities in Latin philology, the candidate is required to have a good reading knowledge of German and French. It is the aim of this course to prepare the candidate to investigate independently the sources of our knowledge of the language, monuments (literary and objective), and life of the Romans. The following is, therefore, an outline of the course: I. In Language: Elements of comparative grammar; introduction to Latin historical grammar; systematic grammar; reading of epigraphic and literary monuments illustrating the history of the Latin Language.
