There will be additions to both. A complete 52 page catalogue will be issued in March, giving complete information. If interested, write at once for one. The University of Virginia Summer School is conducted for teachers and students in high schools, academies and colleges and for those who desire professional training for primary and grammar grade work. It also offers many courses for college credit, and others to meet the needs of students preparing for college entrance or who have conditions to absolve. It takes as its peculiar province, not the ordinary summer institute, but the solid and substantial training of high school teachers, college teachers, college students, and teachers of any grade who wish to procure professional work. LOCATION.âCharlottesville, the seat of the University of Virginia, is in a picturesque and healthful situation among the foot-hills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It is at the junction of two great lines of railway, the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio and the Southern, and is thus of easy access from every part of the country. The sanitary arrangements of the University are excellent. The climate is invigorating, healthful, and free from malarial conditions, the average elevation of the surrounding country being about six hundred and fifty feet above sea level; the water supply is pure, being drawn by gravity from a mountain reservoir six miles away; the system of drains and sewers is complete. The average monthly mean temperature from 1901 to 1911, taken from the records of the weather station at the University Observatory, was: June, 71.4; July, 76.8. Summer rates are given by the railroads to this point. There are three golf links, a well-conducted country club and many other attractions for summer visitors. EXCURSIONS.âUnder the directorship of a competent guide, there will be excursions to neighboring points of interest such as Monticello, the home of Thomas Jefferson; the Natural Bridge; Luray Caverns; the Grottoes of the Shenandoah; the battle fields in Virginia; and any other points to which a sufficiently large number may care to go. The proximity to Washington and Richmond and Old Point Comfort (three hours ride to each) should make a visit to either exceptionally interesting. Saturdays will be reserved for these excursions. On designated clear nights parties will leave Cabell Hall at 8 o'clock to visit the McCormick Astronomical Observatory, where they will be shown the stars through the large telescope in the Observatory. ORGAN RECITALS, ENTERTAINMENTS, AND LECTURES. âThe pipe organ in Cabell Hall is one of the best products of one of the largest organ manufacturers in America. It is an antiphonal organ with fifteen hundred pipes, and exhibits all the possibilities of organ manufacture. To bring out these possibilities requires a master organist, and it is the purpose of the management of the Summer School to procure distinguished organists for the recitals. A Musical Festival and other entertainments will be announced during the session of the Summer School. The Clifford B. Devereux Company will give five plays. The whole course includes about twenty numbers and the price of a season ticket is $2.50 making the cost about the same as moving pictures. REDUCED RAILWAY RATES.âAll students coming to the Summer School from points within the territory covered by the [9] Southeastern Passenger Association, i. e., the territory lying south of the Potomac and east of Mississippi, should apply some time in advance to the local agent for reduced rates which have been granted by the Southern Passenger Association on a basis of approximately three cents a mile plus 25 cents for the round trip. BOARD AND ROOMS.âBoard and room may be had at prices ranging from $4.50 per week, where several stay in the same room, upward, according to accommodations and proximity to the University, the average being $4.50 to $5.50 per week. Most of the boarding houses immediately adjoin the University grounds. One hundred single furnished rooms and one hundred and twenty-five furnished double rooms in the University dormitories will be reserved in the order of application. The price will be $5.00 for the full term of six weeks for a single room, and $8.00 for a double room. Every double room must be occupied by two persons. No reduction will be made for parts of a term. Applications for rooms must be accompanied with the full amount of the fee, which will be returned for good reason and room released if application is made before June 10th. No rooms will be rented to any person who does not register and pay the fee in the Summer School. Rooms that are reserved will not be held later than July 1st. No room will be open for occupancy before June 18th. Roomers must provide themselves with necessary bed clothes, towels, etc. Rooms will be in charge of Mrs. M. P. Harris, an experienced matron and chaperone. Some members of the faculty will be located in each set of dormitories. No cooking allowed in rooms. The rooms on Dawson's Row will be reserved for men. The location of these dormitories in the University grounds and the social advantages resulting from bringing so many teachers close together make this arrangement a very desirable one and the rooms are eagerly sought. The University Commons, conducted by Mr. S. I. Carter, will be open for summer students and will provide table board for three hundred and fifty persons at the very low price of $4.00 a week, $16.50 a month or $23.00 for the session of forty-six days. A lunch counter will be run in connection with the Commons, open from 9:30 A. M. to 11 P. M. Application for dormitory rooms should be sent promptly with retaining fee. For list of boarding houses, rates, etc., see full catalogue, or write to Mr. F. M. Alexander. FEES FOR NON-VIRGINIA STUDENTS.âA single registration fee of fifteen dollars will be charged each teacher who registers from outside of Virginia. This fee will entitle the student to enter any of the courses outlined in the catalogue (except a few special courses which are so designated). No student, however, will be permitted to take more than three advanced courses or six elementary courses without special permission in writing from the Director. Note.âTeachers outside of Virginia are not limited in the choice of their courses to the conditions under which Virginia certificates are issued, unless they desire to teach in Virginia and apply for a license issued in this State. In this case only state certificates from other states issued by a State Superintendent or a State Board of Examiners, and approved in advance by the Department of Public Instruction of Virginia, will be recognized as a proper basis for professional work. Teachers from other states will receive credit for all work done at the University Summer School in accordance with the certificate regulations of those States from which they come. [10] FEES FOR VIRGINIA TEACHERS AND STUDENTS.âTuition will be entirely free to all Virginia teachers in all the regular courses, both elementary and advanced, leading to the professional and first grade certificates. To meet local expenses the State Board of Education has fixed a registration fee of $1.00 for a four weeks' term and $1.50 for a six weeks' term for all of the Summer Schools of the State, and these fees will be charged here. There are a few special courses offered to meet certain demands but not necessary for certificate credit, for which fees will be charged to all who take them. The fee for each is designated in the catalogue. Small fees in laboratory courses will also be charged all students who register in them. Students from Virginia who are not teachers or preparing to teach next session will be charged the same tuition as non-Virginia students. Teachers whose residence is in Virginia but who are teaching outside of Virginia will be charged the same fee as non-Virginians.
